    "spin models on trees were first introduced in the thirties independently by bethe and peierls as a way to implement mean field theories without long range order interactions @xcite , even though it was argued recently @xcite that in some cases , bethe - peierls calculations are more reliable than mean field calculations .",
    "even though there is a mean field type transition for ising as well as xy spins in the bethe  peierls limit ( see section [ bpt ] ) when only the properties of the central spin are considered and the boundary is sent to infinity , there is no transition if one considers the entire cayley tree : since there are no loops , the high temperature expansion of the partition function in a zero magnetic field leads to the same result as the partition function of the ising chain , where it is well - known that there is only a zero temperature transition . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the ising model on the cayley tree @xmath0 and also the xy model : @xmath1 the ising model on the cayley tree has unusual properties : it was shown in @xcite that the cayley tree has a phase transition of continous order .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that the susceptibility is infinite below a temperature @xmath2 ( that we will recover in the core of the paper ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a detailed investigation of the magnetization and overlap distributions of the ising and xy model on the cayley tree .",
    "the trees that are considered here are the so  called _ half  space  trees _ , that is recursive trees such that the ancestor has two neighbors , the bulk sites have three neighbors and the leaves have only one neighbor .",
    "see figure [ fig1 ] for a picture of a @xmath3half  space  tree .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that below a cross  over temperature scale @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the number of generations , the ising spin system is magnetized and the magnetization distribution is non gaussian , with the existence of local maxima . in the case of xy spins @xcite , the spin system is magnetized below a cross  over temperature scale @xmath6 , but there are no local maxima in the magnetization distribution , even though there is a large , non gaussian tail .",
    "the magnetization distribution is investigated using two techniques .",
    "first , we calculate analytically the asymptotic scaling of the moments @xmath7 for large system sizes , where @xmath8 is the total magnetization .",
    "we show that in the case of ising spins and in the case of xy spins , the moments of the magnetization have a non trivial scaling .",
    "below a temperature @xmath2 that is defined in the bulk of the paper , there is one scaling dimension lower than unity but larger than @xmath9 .",
    "if the temperature is larger than @xmath2 and lower than the bethe - peierls temperature , there are two scaling dimensions , but one of them ( even moments ) is @xmath9 ( scaling dimension of random walks ) .",
    "the other one ( odd moments ) is lower than @xmath9 but larger than zero .",
    "the reason why the scaling dimension of odd moments is non zero is that the ancestor s spin is frozen in a given direction . above the bethe  peierls temperature , all the spins are uncorrelated and the scaling dimensions are trivial : @xmath9 for even moments and zero for odd moments .",
    "next , we study numerically the fractal properties of the magnetization distribution measure in the ising case .",
    "the magnetization distribution defines a measure on the interval @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is the number of sites : @xmath12 there exists a temperature regime where this measure is fractal in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the fractal dimension does not decay monotonously as the temperature decreases .",
    "we also analyze the overlap distribution and reach similar conclusions .",
    "it is know since the thirties @xcite that the ising model on the cayley tree has a mean - field like transition . for a review on spin systems in the bethe - peierls approach ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea is to decimate spins at the boundary of a @xmath5half  space  tree and to obtain an equivalent @xmath13half  space  tree with a magnetic field at the boundary .",
    "we note @xmath14 the partition function of a @xmath5half  space  tree with a magnetic field @xmath15 at the boundary .",
    "we first consider the situation where two spins @xmath16 and @xmath17 are connected to a common ancestor @xmath18 .",
    "the partition function is @xmath19 the summation over @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been factored out since there are no loops .",
    "we next write @xmath20 under the form @xmath21 .",
    "since there are two equations ( one for @xmath22 and one for @xmath23 ) , the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 exist and are uniquely determined by @xmath26 the zero field behavior of @xmath27 is @xmath28 there exists a finite temperature @xmath29 such as @xmath30 . if @xmath31 , the magnetic field is exponentially amplified , leading to a mean field type phase transition in the bethe - peierls limit @xcite .",
    "if @xmath32 , the magnetic field is irrelevant .",
    "as far as the @xmath5half  space  tree is concerned , we have @xmath33      we now turn to the case of xy spins .",
    "we assume that a small magnetic field @xmath34 is switched on at the boundary .",
    "the partition function of two spins connected to a common ancestor @xmath18 is @xmath35 since the magnetic field is small , we can expand ( [ zxy ] ) up to the second order in @xmath34 and reexponentiate to obtain @xmath36 with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the probability that the angular difference between two nearest neighbor spins is @xmath39 : @xmath40 notice that by replacing @xmath41 by @xmath42 , we recover the ising case : @xmath43 is the probability @xmath44 that two nearest - neighbor spins are antiparallel ; @xmath45 is the probability that two nearest neighbor spins are parallel ; @xmath46 becomes @xmath47 .",
    "this section is organized as follows : we first derive the magnetization distribution recursion for ising spins .",
    "the xy spin case is simply related to the ising case by the aforementioned transformation @xmath48 .",
    "the next step is to calculate by recursion the scaling behavior of all the moments .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive the magnetization distribution recursion for xy spins .",
    "we call @xmath49 the conditional probability density of the magnetization of xy spins on a @xmath5-half - space - tree , the ancestor pointing in the direction @xmath50 .",
    "we put two @xmath5-half  space  trees together as pictured on figure [ fig1 ] to obtain a @xmath51half  space  tree . since the link variables are statistically independent , we have @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath38 is defined by ( [ w(u ) ] ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to derive recursion relations for the average of the moments .",
    "we prove the following proposition by induction : @xmath53 the average @xmath54 means an average over a @xmath5half  space  tree with the spin ancestor frozen in the direction @xmath50 .",
    "a a by - product , we derive a recursion relation for the @xmath55 s .",
    "clearly , @xmath56 is true , with @xmath57 .",
    "we now show that @xmath58 .",
    "we first write @xmath59 under the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 next , assuming @xmath62 , we consider the eight cases where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are even or odd , and show that @xmath66 is either independent on @xmath50 if @xmath63 is even or latexmath:[$i_{n , q , l , m}(\\theta)=    independent on @xmath50",
    ". it would be tedious to enumerate here the eight cases , and we just pick  up only one case as an exemple : @xmath63 odd , @xmath64 odd and @xmath65 even . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath68 using the fact that @xmath69 , it is easy to show that @xmath70 which is of the announced form .",
    "we have written @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 because the form of this result is independent on whether we have xy or ising spins : one just has to choose @xmath73 or @xmath74 according to the nature of the spin variables .",
    "we can also show that @xmath75 is independent on @xmath63 .",
    "more precisely , we note @xmath76 with this notation , it is easy to show that @xmath77 which leads us to the following recursion for the @xmath78 s : @xmath79 where , for further purposes , we have separated the term @xmath80 from the terms @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .      our aim is to calculate the asymptotic behavior of the moments of the magnetization",
    ". we have to distinguish between two cases : @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 .",
    "notice that @xmath85 corresponds to the inverse temperature above which the susceptibility per spin diverges @xcite .",
    "this is in fact not surprising since the susceptibility can be calculated from the moments of the magnetization using the fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem .      in the regime @xmath83 ,",
    "we prove by induction the following proposition : @xmath87 @xmath88 is obviously true and @xmath89 .",
    "we show that @xmath90 , and as a byproduct , we find the recursion relations for the @xmath91 s .",
    "we first examine the case where @xmath63 is odd .",
    "then , @xmath92 . using ( [ rec ] )",
    "we can express @xmath78 in terms of the @xmath93 with @xmath82 we find @xmath94 with @xmath95 we now assume @xmath96 in order to find the asypmtotic behavior of @xmath97 , in the large @xmath5 limit , which is @xmath98 the case @xmath99 is special due to the fact that one has to take into account the @xmath100 term in ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "this case has to be treated separately , and one finds @xcite @xcite : @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 , the @xmath100 term in ( [ sol ] ) is sub  dominant , and we get for @xmath103 @xmath104 , with @xmath105 if @xmath63 is even , @xmath106 .",
    "we carry out the same reasoning and we find the following recursion relation for @xmath91 if @xmath107 : @xmath108 we have used the assumption @xmath83 ( ie @xmath109 ) to determine which term is dominant in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "notice that @xmath91 is effectively independent of @xmath5 , as was stated in proposition ( [ thisprop ] ) . in the case @xmath110",
    ", we find that @xmath111 which is exactly what was found in @xcite .",
    "in the regime @xmath113 , we call @xmath114 the following proposition : @xmath115 and we show by induction that @xmath114 is true .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that @xmath116 and @xmath117 are true .",
    "the technique to show that @xmath118 is the same as in section [ lowt ] : we use ( [ rec ] ) and we analyze separately the case @xmath63 even and @xmath63 odd . after straightforward calculations , we conclude that @xmath118 , and that @xmath119 if @xmath63 is even , and @xmath120 if @xmath63 is odd .      we have thus shown that if @xmath83 , the dominant behavior of the moments of the magnetization in the large @xmath5 limit is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the number of sites . using the analogy to multifractals",
    "@xcite , this means that there is one singularity of strength @xmath123 , and of scaling dimension @xmath124 .",
    "now , if @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 if @xmath63 is even and @xmath127 if @xmath63 is odd . there are two singularities of scaling dimension @xmath128 if @xmath63 is even and @xmath129 if @xmath63 is odd .",
    "if the temperature goes to the bethe ",
    "peierls transition temperature , @xmath130 and @xmath131 . at the bethe ",
    "peierls transition , the correlation length is shorter than the lattice spacing @xcite , and all the spins are thus uncorrelated .",
    "the magnetization is thus the sum of @xmath122 random independent spin variables . above the bethe - peierls temperature ,",
    "the scaling dimension of even moments is @xmath9 , as the one of random walks @xcite , and the scaling dimension of odd moments is zero .",
    "notice that these result are true for xy spins as well as ising spins .",
    "one just has to pick  up the right @xmath71 function .",
    "this conclusion is to be contrasted with the behavior of the magnetization distribution .",
    "we have shown numerically that the magnetization distribution has local maxima in the case of ising spins @xcite , and no local maxima in the case of xy spins @xcite . even though the scaling of the moments of the magnetization of xy spins is non trivial",
    ", the magnetization distribution is a smooth function , with a long tail , but obviously no local maxima , unlike the case of ising spins where , as explained in section [ mag dis ] the magnetization distribution has a proliferation of local maxima , at low temperatures , and we find non trivial fractal dimensions for the probability distribution measure .",
    "the aim of this section is to analyze the low temperature magnetization distribution @xmath132 in the ising case , where local maxima of the magnetization distribution are present @xcite .",
    "the main result of this section is the computation of the fractal dimension of the magnetization distribution at low temperatures . by fractal dimension ,",
    "we mean the fractal dimension of the measure @xmath132 , as defined in @xcite .",
    "we insist on the fact that these results are strongly dependent on the discrete nature of the spin variables .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that below a temperature of the order @xmath4 , the magnetization is non gaussian .",
    "this temperature scale corresponds to the temperature cross  over in @xmath133 which leads to the aforementioned cross  over temperature .",
    "our goal is to investigate the scaling properties of the low temperature magnetization distribution .",
    "the magnetization distribution is plotted on figure [ fig2 ] for three temperatures .",
    "we see that as the temperature decreases , the magnetization distribution looks more and more fractal . in order to put this observation on a quantitative basis , we divide the segment @xmath10 $ ] into @xmath64 pieces of size @xmath134,and we call @xmath135 the probability measure of the @xmath136-th segment",
    ". we calculate @xcite @xmath137 and look for the behavior of @xmath138 for large @xmath64 .",
    "if the temperature is not too low , we can identify the existence of a scaling regime , namely @xmath139 is linear as a function of @xmath140 for large @xmath64 ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) . in practise",
    ", one can not reach the @xmath141 regime because the magnetization is a discrete variable .",
    "the next step consists in calculation the slope of @xmath142 as a function of @xmath143 in the scaling regime : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the strength of the singularity , @xmath146 the fractal dimension of the probability measure and @xmath147 the generalized dimension . in the multifractal case ,",
    "both @xmath145 and @xmath146 depend on @xmath63 . in our case",
    ", we find that @xmath148 is linear as a function of @xmath63 , so that there is only one fractal dimension in our problem .",
    "the fractal dimension is plotted on figure [ fig4 ] as a function of the inverse temperature for different sizes .",
    "the fractal dimension of the magnetization distribution does not decay monotonously to zero as the temperature decreases , and we observe finite size effects .",
    "we have no analytic understanding of the existence of temperature domains where the fractal dimension of the magnetization increases as the temperature decreases .",
    "finite size effects are understood as follows .",
    "below a temperature @xmath149 of the order of @xmath4 , the kinks ( ie antiparallel nearest neighbor spins ) give rise to well  defined domains of magnetization @xcite .",
    "consider one kink on a @xmath5half  space  tree .",
    "the probability to find a kink at generation @xmath150 ( counted from the ancestor ) is @xmath151 a kink at generation @xmath150 would involve @xmath152 spin flips .",
    "now consider one kink on a @xmath51half  space  tree .",
    "the probability to find a kink at generation @xmath153 is @xmath154 which would also involve @xmath152 spin flips .",
    "since , in the limit of large @xmath5 , @xmath155 , the magnetization distribution is essentially the same on a @xmath5half  space  tree and a @xmath51half  space  tree provided the temperature is rescaled such as the number of antiparallel bonds is the same . in other words",
    ", we should not plot the fractal magnetization of the magnetization distribution versus the inverse temperature , but rather versus the number of antiparallel bonds @xmath156 .",
    "when the fractal dimension of the magnetization probability measure is plotted versus the number of antiparallel bonds , all the curves collapse on a single master curve ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) .    then , one question arises : numerically , we can only reach a small number of generations .",
    "is it still a master curve in the thermodynamic limit ?",
    "the answer is yes . we showed in @xcite that the magnetization distribution is non gaussian below a temperature scale @xmath157 which tends slowly to zero if the number of sites increases .",
    "since we are interested in the physics with a small number of broken bonds ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) , this cross - over does not come into account .",
    "more precisely , we can calculate the number of broken bonds at the cross  over temperature @xmath149 : @xmath158 this quantity diverges in the @xmath159 limit , so that the master curve ( fractal dimension of the measure @xmath132 versus the number of broken bonds ) still exists in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in other words , we are interested here in the physics at temperatures of the order @xmath6 , which decays much faster than the cross  over scale @xmath157 .",
    "we now wish to analyze the overlap distribution in the same way as we analyzed the magnetization distribution . from now on , we work only with ising spins .",
    "the notion of overlap distribution @xmath160 was introduced by parisi in the context of spin glass theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is to consider two uncoupled copies of the same spin system at the same temperature and to define the overlap as @xmath161 = \\frac{q}{n } = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\sigma_i \\tilde{\\sigma}_i , \\ ] ] where @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the spin variables in the two copies .",
    "the overlap distribution is given by @xmath164 ) .\\ ] ] more specifically , we call @xmath165 the probability that the overlap between two copies is @xmath166 , given that the two ancestor s spins are @xmath167 .",
    "using the fact that the link variables are statistically independent , we have @xmath168 \\delta(q - q_1-q_2 - 1 ) \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 are some temperature dependent coefficients : @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the recursion relation for the overlap distribution ( [ recq ] ) is similar to the recursion relation for the magnetization distribution ( [ recm ] ) , except that the coefficients are not the same .",
    "we thus expect the same physics , namely the appearance of non trivial scaling dimensions in the scaling of the moments of the overlap distribution as a function of the system size , and also the fact that the overlap distribution is a fractal measure at low temperatures . in what follows ,",
    "we denote by @xmath176 the @xmath63-th moment of the overlap distribution : @xmath177 .",
    "we want to calculate the asymptotic behavior of @xmath178 and @xmath179 in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "the calculations are straightforward , so that we do not give the details here .",
    "as far as @xmath178 is concerned , we obtain two different regimes : if @xmath180 , @xmath181 and if @xmath182 : @xmath183 as far as @xmath179 is concerned , we need to define the temperature @xmath184 such that @xmath185 . we find that if @xmath186 , @xmath187 if @xmath188 , @xmath189      carrying out the same calculation as in section [ lemma ] , we find that @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 . if @xmath63 is even , @xmath193 and @xmath194 if @xmath63 is odd .      using the relation ( [ recb ] ) , we can derive the asymptotic behavior of the moments .",
    "the idea is to prove the following results by induction . using a method similar to the one of section [ sec3.3 ]",
    ", we derive the asymptotic behavior of @xmath176 .      in this regime ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the moments of the overlap distribution is @xmath196 with the following recursion relation for the @xmath197 s : @xmath198 if @xmath63 is even .",
    "if @xmath63 is odd , we have @xmath199      the asymptotic behavior of the moments in this temperature regime is @xmath201 the recursion relations for the @xmath202 s are as follows . if @xmath63 is even @xmath203 if @xmath63 is odd , @xmath204      we have thus shown that if @xmath195 , @xmath205 with @xmath122 the number of sites , which leads to a scaling dimension @xmath206 .    if @xmath200 , @xmath207 for even moments , corresponding to a scaling dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling of the odd moments is @xmath208 leading to a scaling dimension @xmath209 . if @xmath195 , the scaling dimensions are trivial in the sense that the scaling dimension of even momenta is @xmath9 and the scaling dimension of odd momenta is zero .",
    "since @xmath210 , there exists a regime of temperature @xmath211 in which the scaling dimension of the even momenta of both the magnetization and the overlap are @xmath9 , but where the odd momenta of the magnetization are not trivial ( between @xmath212 and @xmath9 ) while the odd momenta of the overlap distribution are trivial ( zero ) .",
    "we now analyze the overlap distribution @xmath213 , which is plotted on figure [ fig6 ] for different temperatures .",
    "if the temperature decreases , the overlap distribution has local maxima , and , if the temperature further decreases , the number of local maxima increases , and at low temperatures , the overlap distribution looks fractal . using the technique described in section [ mag dis ] , we can calculate the fractal dimension of the measure @xmath213 .",
    "this quantity is plotted on figure [ fig7 ] as a function of the average number of antiparallel bonds .",
    "again , we find that the variations of the fractal dimension of the measure @xmath213 as a function of the number of antiparallel bonds is non monotonous .",
    "we have analyzed the asymptotic scaling of all the moments and the fractal dimension of the measures @xmath132 and @xmath213 .",
    "there exists a temperature region @xmath211 where the magnetization moments are in an intermediate regime ( scaling dimension @xmath9 for even moments and non zero scaling dimension for odd moments ) whereas the moments of the overlap distribution are in a high temperature regime .",
    "another conclusion is that in both cases , the fractal dimension of the measures @xmath132 and @xmath213 do not decrease monotonously as a function of temperature .",
    "we have no qualitative understanding of this observation .",
    "two directions for future work are under investigation : the analysis of fractals and percolation clusters , where it was shown that the magnetization distribution has also local maxima at low temperatures @xcite . another direction is the analysis of magnetized spin glasses .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , in the magnetized spin glass phase of the @xmath214 model , the magnetization distribution has local maxima .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the results of the present paper with the behavior of the magnetized spin glass .",
