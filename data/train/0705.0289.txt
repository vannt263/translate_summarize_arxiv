    "in the nearly 10 years that have passed since the first observation of discrete energy levels in metallic clusters there still remains the question of how the levels are statistically distributed in these systems .",
    "it has been suggested that random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite is applicable to the statistical properties of the spectra of metallic clusters in much the same way that it is applicable to the slow neutron resonant spectra @xcite observed in the 1950s and 1960s . however experimental verification of the applicability of rmt in these systems is still challenging because of the difficulty in gathering a sufficient number of levels to analyze their statistical distribution .",
    "the first observations of discrete energy levels or particle in a box energy levels  in metallic clusters were made by ralph , black and tinkham @xcite in 1995 .",
    "the energy levels were observed as irregular steps contained within the coulomb staircase in the current - voltage characteristics of clusters that were fabricated using a fixed tunneling geometry with metallic electrodes .",
    "these uneven steps in the current - voltage measurements might be a consequence of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "@xcite this suggestion arises from earlier predictions that address these systems from various theoretical standpoints , including efetov s supersymmetry derivation.@xcite while these expectations are theoretically well established they are experimentally difficult to realize because of non - equilibrium effects @xcite and capacitive charging energy terms that have a tendency to mask the energy levels in mesoscopic systems .",
    "subsequent tunneling experiments have been performed on metallic clusters @xcite  and semiconducting dots @xcite@xmath0@xcite which have yielded results similar to those of ralph _ et al_. , although the nature of the level statistics still remains elusive .",
    "in contrast to metallic clusters , experimental work has exhaustively addressed the issue of distributions of level spacings and eigenfunctions of quantum dots fabricated from two dimensional electron gas systems of various pre - defined shapes.@xcite in these systems , electron - electron interactions dominate transport and the level spacing distributions appear to be gaussian , while the distributions of the amplitudes of the eigenfunctions follow a porter - thomas distribution which is a signature of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .    random matrix theory ( rmt )  and quantum chaos were merged in the conjecture put forward by bohigas , giannoni and schmit @xcite in 1984 .",
    "this conjecture states that the nearest neighbor energy level spacings of classically chaotic systems should be distributed according the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , or wigner - dyson @xcite distribution and this conjecture is strongly supported by aggregated numerical studies .    the wigner - dyson distribution which describes the statistical distribution of nearest neighbor energy levels normalized to the mean energy level has several important features as described by porter .",
    "@xcite first , the probability of having nearest neighbors with zero spacing disappears .",
    "second , the probability of a level spacing is linear in energy before approaching a maximum , with the maximum occurring close to the mean energy and the tail of the distribution being fairly small .",
    "this is in contrast with completely random levels ( a classically non - chaotic system ) where the distribution is poissonian . for the latter distribution",
    "the probability is largest at zero level spacing .",
    "the absence of small spacings in the wigner - dyson distribution is known as the : `` repulsion of energy levels '' .",
    "@xcite this is the key ingredient of a wigner - dyson distribution and distinguishes classically chaotic from classically non - chaotic systems .    besides the distributions of the eigenvalues which are most often addressed experimentally , it is also possible to study the statistics of the amplitudes of the eigenfunctions within the context of rmt .",
    "the corresponding distribution is called the porter - thomas @xcite distribution .",
    "the porter - thomas distribution is simply a statement about the amplitude @xmath1 of a wavefunction at any given point is a random variable .",
    "the distribution of the square of a random variable , @xmath2which is gaussian distributed , is the porter - thomas distribution .",
    "it is also interesting to note that it is possible , in some systems , to tune a transition from regular to chaotic behavior in which the distributions of the nearest neighbor level spacing change from poisson to wigner - dyson .",
    "this has been found numerically in the study of the rydberg levels of the hydrogen atom @xcite in which the transition is tuned by the application of an increasingly strong magnetic field and experimentally in diamagnetic helium by tuning the excitation energy in the presence of a magnetic field.@xcite    here we present experimental results that indicate that statistical distributions of highly irregularly shaped pb clusters follow rmt .",
    "this is an extension of earlier work @xcite and its purpose is to address in detail experimental issues and present additional results which led to our conclusions .",
    "the present paper is divided into five major sections as follows : in section ii we treat the device geometry that was configured to study the discrete energy level spectra of metallic clusters . in section iii",
    ", we relate energy spectra to the geometry and discuss in detail the observed features of the spectra . in section",
    "iv we discuss the results of the preceding section in terms of statistical distributions of both the eigenvalues and the amplitude of the moduli of the eigenfunctions . in section",
    "v , we demonstrate the use of scanning tunneling spectroscopy to resolve real time images of a quantity that is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the eigenfunctions in these systems .",
    "before describing the current - voltage characteristics , it is worthwhile to summarize some of the salient features of the device configuration relevant to this work that are different from other spectroscopy measurements on metallic clusters .",
    "the tunneling geometry that was used is different from that used previously in three important respects .",
    "first , pb clusters were grown on a semiconducting substrate .",
    "this substrate was highly resistive with a resistivity at room temperature greater than 1000 @xmath3 cm .",
    "@xcite second , the clusters were fabricated using the buffer layer assisted growth technique that was developed by weaver and co - workers @xcite in which xe , an inert gas , is used as a buffer layer to control the size distribution of the clusters .",
    "this physical technique allows the clusters to land softly onto the substrate and involves no use of chemicals or organics in the growth process .",
    "third , fabrication of the clusters and spectroscopic measurements were carried out _ in situ _ in an ultrahigh vacuum environment thus preventing contamination .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure1.eps    from the standpoint of conventional scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments it is also unique in both the use of a highly resistive substrate and the addition of a bilayer of ti / pt electrodes on top of the substrate .",
    "the device geometry is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the first barrier separating",
    "the stm tip ( not shown ) from the cluster is a vacuum barrier while the second barrier between the cluster and the substrate is a thin silicon oxide barrier .",
    "this double tunnel junction arrangement is necessary for the resolution of discrete energy levels in these nanostructures .",
    "the experimental details of the cluster fabrication have been published elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the buffer layered assisted growth involves initially depositing four monolayers of xe onto a cold substrate that is held at temperatures less than 50k .",
    "the pressure of the xe is controlled upon entry into the deposition chamber by a capacitance manometer .",
    "the condensed xe is then subjected to a precisely controlled exposure of pb vapor flux .",
    "the average film thickness of pb was less than 0.2   as measured by a calibrated quartz crystal oscillator .",
    "subsequently the substrate is slowly warmed to room temperature such that the xe desorbs and the pb clusters softly land onto the substrate . the resulting sample which is held on a rotable liquid helium cooled transfer rod",
    "is moved _ in situ _ into the stm  chamber through a large gate valve and placed via a wobble stick onto the stm  stage .",
    "all stm measurements were made with the stm  operating at 4.2 k although the electron temperature is significantly larger .",
    "the stm  tip that was used in the experiment was made from tungsten wire .",
    "the tip was characterized prior to making spectroscopy measurements by demonstrating atomic scale resolution of a graphite surface .",
    "after fabrication , the pb clusters were characteristized using stm .",
    "the heights of the clusters were measured and found to be mostly between 3   to 12  , with an average cluster height of 8  .",
    "when a bias voltage was applied between the tip and counter - electrodes on top of the si substrate with the cluster in between , the current was measured through the cluster .",
    "current flows when the levels of the cluster come into juxtaposition with the level(s ) at the interface state or another set of discrete energy levels from a neighboring cluster .",
    "the peaks observed in the current - voltage curves ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) are indicative that resonant tunneling processes are operative whenever one of the cluster s quantized states is probed .",
    "this will be further elaborated upon in the next section .",
    "in this section we shall be concerned with measurements of current - voltage characteristics of a series combination of two sets of discrete energy levels of systems separated by  insulating barriers .",
    "electron transmission through the clusters was probed by the stm  tip in spectroscopy mode .",
    "the tunneling current was recorded as a function of applied sample bias voltage @xmath4 while the stm feedback loop was open . in this case , the tip was held at a fixed height above the cluster while the current - voltage characteristics were recorded .",
    "the data presented in this work were all obtained in voltage step sizes of 480 @xmath5 or 612 @xmath5 in a time frame @xmath60.2 @xmath7 per point .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure2.eps    due to resonant tunneling between the tip , the cluster , the interface state , and finally the pt electrode , the @xmath8 characteristics exhibit peaks as shown in fig .",
    "these peaks are irregularly spaced and varied in height and are dependent on cluster size .",
    "the statistics of peak heights and spacings will be discussed in the next section ( sec .",
    "several hundred @xmath8 curves were obtained on each cluster and their character varied along a given cluster in a nonsystematic manner .",
    "the magnitude of the differential conductance is an appropriate measure of whether or not the tunneling regime is the correct description of the transport .",
    "this will be addressed in this section along with a brief discussion of elastic and inelastic tunneling as it pertains to the linewidths .",
    "also the relationship between the @xmath8 curves and the sizes of the clusters will be discussed .",
    "but first we will take up the issue of resonant tunneling in this system .",
    "the data is quite different from that which would be obtained in a  geometry in which metallic atoms ( or clusters ) are deposited on an oxidized metallic surface and transmission is via nonresonant process .",
    "@xcite      the observation of peaks instead of steps strongly suggests that the transport through the cluster is due to resonant tunneling processes .",
    "@xcite@xmath9@xcite one possible explanation of how this occurs is the existence of an interface state between the pb clusters and the si substrate .",
    "it is known from photoemission experiments that such an interface exists between pb and si(111 ) and this interface state is nearly dispersionless.@xcite while there are differences in resistivity between the si substrate that was used in our study and the photoemission experiment , we assume that such a state exists .    in all the @xmath8 spectra ,",
    "the tunneling current is suppressed around zero bias followed by a series of peaks at both negative and positive bias .",
    "the current is suppressed when the energy levels of the cluster are not in registry with the interface state .",
    "the double barrier tunnel junction that is realized by positioning the stm tip over a pb cluster is highly asymmetric with the first tunneling barrier between the tip and the cluster and the second barrier between the cluster and the substrate .",
    "this asymmetry is manifested in the asymmetry of the @xmath8 curves about zero bias .",
    "resonance occurs when the fermi wavelength spans the length of the cluster .",
    "the fermi wavelength for pb is 4   at room temperature.@xcite given that the average height is 8  , and measurements were carried out at liquid helium temperatures , the assumption that the tunneling mechanism is a resonant process is appropriate .",
    "table [ pb parameters ] catalogs the pb clusters with the estimated number of atoms per cluster , and estimated and measured mean level spacings . the volume of the clusters was calculated assuming that each cluster is a hemispherical cap such that the volume , @xmath10 .",
    "is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radius and @xmath13 is the height of the cluster .",
    "since the clusters were irregularly shaped , their radius was estimated from @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the length of the cluster and @xmath16 is the width .",
    "the estimated number of atoms was calculated from @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lattice parameter of pb and is equal to 4.95 .@xcite the estimated mean level spacing , which was calculated using the nearly free electron model , is @xmath19  and compared to the measured mean level spacings .",
    "several of the clusters measured mean level spacing were in the range of @xmath20 .",
    "there are several explanations for this .",
    "first , the majority of the clusters had the same height which is a result of the buffer layer assisted growth technique when using a four monolayer thick buffer layer .",
    "second , the calculation of the volume is a rough estimate and not entirely accurate in that it oversimplifies the actual shape of the clusters .",
    "third , the clusters were not well isolated from each other thus the width and the length could be larger if more than one cluster was taken into consideration .",
    "also , tip convolution effects obscure the actual width and length of the clusters .",
    "nonetheless there is an apparent dependency on the level spacing energy on the size of the clusters .",

    "this can be circumvented by having two sets of electronic states separated by a barrier through which the current is measured . in this tunneling scenario ,",
    "electron transport is expected to occur only when the energy levels of the two states are aligned with one another @xcite and the upper bounds of the lifetimes of energy levels of varying size clusters can be estimated from the average widths of the resonances that results from these level alignments .",
    "the reason that these widths are upper bounds is that they depend on both the reciprocals of the lifetimes of the electronic states and the tunneling rates .",
    "we fit the full width half maximum of the peak widths in the i - v curves for three clusters to lorentzians ( lorentzians provided the best fit to the data ) and found that they varied depending on the cluster size . for cluster 1 ,",
    "the average peak width was 3.54 mev ( tunneling time : 1.9 @xmath28seconds ) , for cluster 7 , the average peak width was 3.06 mev ( tunneling time :  2.4 @xmath29seconds ) and for cluster 12 , the average peak width was 1.06 mev ( tunneling time : 6.2 @xmath30seconds ) indicating that it takes longer to tunnel through a larger cluster than a smaller one .",
    "lorentzian  peak widths are also an indication that the tunneling process is elastic .",
    "moreover , the absence of diffusion ( the transport is ballistic ) together with the spatial resolution of the stm  enables detailed studies of the clusters electronic states .",
    "figure [ conductance ] shows a plot of the differential conductance in units of e@xmath31/h plotted against positive bias for one of the clusters .",
    "this is supporting evidence that the features are related to elastic tunneling processes as the conductance is less than one and the peaks are lorentzians .",

    "voltage curves seen in the results reported by kouwenhoven , austing and tarucha .",
    "@xcite it might be the case , that neighboring clusters are actually gating the cluster under investigation .",
    "this would offer an alternative explanation to the position dependence of the i - v curves as the capacitance will change due to the distance between the gating cluster and the site on the cluster that was being probed by the stm tip .",
    "further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism behind the peaks in the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "one such possible experiment would be to fabricate the clusters without the electrodes configured on top of the substrate .",
    "this would provide a more uniform distribution of clusters and increase the separation between clusters since the clusters tended to conglomerate near the electrodes .",
    "current peaks in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy were not expected . however , in an attempt to interpret the results the data was analyzed with the assumption that the peaks were signatures of discrete energy levels .",
    "exact agreement with different sets of discrete energy levels for both the negative and positive bias voltages would demand that the capacitances between both the tip and cluster and cluster and substrate are substantially different , which we believe is the case .",
    "regardless , from the i - v measurements themselves , it is not possible to confirm that the peaks in the negative and bias voltages arise from different energy levels without further analysis .",
    "therefore , based on the premise that the discrete energy spectra in metallic clusters should follow rmt , we studied the statistical distributions of both the peak spacings and peak heights .",

    "finally we turn our attention to imaging the eigenfunctions of the clusters using a scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "the wavefunction moduli are directly related to the tunneling current , so by mapping the tunneling current amplitude at a fixed bias , it is possible to study the significance of chaos as a function of cluster shape .",
    "an image of the current peaks is shown in fig .",
    "[ imagechaos ] for cluster no .",
    "4 .  the current peaks change as a function of applied bias ( not shown ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    figure9new.eps    the current dependence as a function of bias voltage can be used to image  the chaotic nature of irregularly shaped metallic clusters .",
    "this gained prominence in the experimental community with the pioneering experiments of sridhar and co - workers .",
    "@xcite besides acquiring images of the clusters , it is possible to produce images of chaotic behavior in the same manner than was carried out by sridhar using electric field to probe the distributions of eigenfunctions in a sinai and rectangular  structure .",
    "in essence scanning tunneling spectroscopy is a technique that can be used to map out the amplitude of the eigenfunctions which are otherwise difficult to access .",
    "the empirical evidence indicates that discrete energy levels are being accessed from a resonant tunneling geometry and that the distributions of these energy levels reflect the underlying classical dynamical nature of an electron under confinement of its boundary .",
    "this means that our study of the distribution of spacings gives information about the symmetry properties of the physical system in question . in this study of metal clusters ,",
    "there are remaining questions that still need be resolved .  first what is the nature of the tunneling process ?  is the electron s route through an si interface state , or through neighboring clusters ?",
    "future experimental work needs to be carried out in which the clusters are separated from one another in order to resolve this issue .",
    "the second question that needs to be answered is why are the spin - orbit interactions suppressed ?  that is , why not gaussian sympletic ensemble statistics instead of wigner- dyson statistics ?",
    "this issue needs to be explored both theoretically and experimentally in greater detail .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the experts in this field that have provided useful and stimulating discussions with us about our work .",
    "specifically we thank leonid glazman , alex kamenev , and denis ullmo .",
    "also , one of us ( l. l. a. a. ) would like to thank the organizers , instructors and participants attending the boulder condensed matter summer school ( 2005 ) for many lively and helpful discussions .",
