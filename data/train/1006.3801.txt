    "there is an increasing demand for novel architectures that afford the possibility of spin polarized electron transport , a field known as spintronics.@xcite a key element involves control of the magnetic anisotropy in ferromagnetic films and nanostructures .",
    "accordingly , the ability to manipulate the underlying magnetic states of the spin polarizers is desirable .",
    "in addition to traditional solid - state materials , molecule - based magnetic systems are being investigated.@xcite the discovery of large and persistent photoinduced changes in the magnetization in some examples of cyanometallate coordination polymers makes them attractive materials to consider.@xcite    herein , studies of the magnetic anisotropy of thin and thick films along with standard powder - like samples of bimetallic prussian blue analogues , a@xmath11m@xmath12[m(cn)@xmath6@xmath13h@xmath8o , where a is an alkali ion and m@xmath14 and m are transition metal ions,@xcite are reported .",
    "previously , the anisotropic response of the persistent photoinduced magnetism of thin films of rb - co - fe ( referring to a - m@xmath14-m ) prussian blue analogues was discovered@xcite and subsequently studied systematically.@xcite the motivation to understand the origins of this anisotropic phenomenon is amplified by the ability to control the magnetization of prussian blue analogues by photo - irradiation@xcite or pressure.@xcite however , the magnetic response of the photo - controllable a - co - fe system is complicated by the multiple stable oxidation states of the co and fe ions and by orbital angular momentum contributions .",
    "consequently , the rb - ni - cr prussian blue analogue , a ferromagnet system possessing a spectrum of long - range ordering temperatures , @xmath15  k , depending on stoichiometry,@xcite was chosen as the centerpiece for the present work because the magnetic and physical properties of this system are robust and the ions have stable oxidation states that possess no first - order angular momentum .",
    "finally , it is important to stress the significance of our findings . although the study of the magnetism of solid - state films is a mature field , the extensions to molecule - based magnetism are just beginning to emerge .",
    "for example , with the drive to develop new devices , applications with single crystals are being explored.@xcite however , the exploitation of molecule - based magnetic films may be more attractive for industrial fabrication , and devices based on metal - phthalocyanines@xcite and metal[tcne : tetracyanethylene]@xmath16@xcite are two examples of work in this direction . in our work , the origins of the magnetic anisotropy in films of prussian blue analogues will be linked to demagnetization effects after we have systematically eliminated all other plausible explanations , some of which are not issues in traditional solid - state magnetic films . as a result ,",
    "our results provide a foundation from which the magnetism in films of prussian blue analogues may be understood and employed in new devices .    , normalized to the fc values at @xmath17 k , @xmath18 ,",
    "are shown for ( a ) low , @xmath19 mt , and ( b ) high , @xmath20 t , applied magnetic fields .",
    "for clarity , the data for the thin film are not shown in ( b ) .",
    "the anisotropic response for @xmath21 applied parallel ( @xmath22 ) or perpendicular ( @xmath23 ) to the films is strikingly similar for both thin and thick films .",
    "the field - induced shift of @xmath10 from @xmath24 k to @xmath25 k is observable . for each panel ,",
    "the solid lines are the results of analysis using demagnetization factors ( see text).,width=324 ]",
    "the synthesis of the powder samples followed established protocols,@xcite while the films were generated using sequential adsorption methods@xcite that are detailed elsewhere.@xcite briefly stated , the film synthesis consists of using a solid support , such as melinex 535 , and immersing it in an aqueous solution of ni@xmath26 ions and then in another aqueous solution of cr(cn)@xmath27 containing rb@xmath28 ions .",
    "after each immersion step , washing with water is essential to remove the excess ions , and the process can be iterated multiple cycles to yield films of varying thicknesses and morphologies . for this work ,",
    "two films , one of 40  cycles and the other of 400  cycles , are reported .",
    "whereas the powder samples consisted of small polycrystals with diameters of @xmath3  nm , which are magnetically in the `` bulk '' limit,@xcite the 40 cycles and 400 cycles films had thicknesses of @xmath0  nm and @xmath1  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "finally , other rb - m@xmath14-m prussian blue analogue films were investigated , including rb - co - cr , rb - cu - cr , rb - zn - cr , rb - ni - fe , rb - co - fe , rb - cu - fe , and rb - zn - fe.@xcite     is shown for the case of the thick film when @xmath20 t and @xmath29  k. the discrete steps of 1.5@xmath30 are detectable , and the data were taken continuously at each angle that was held for a period of 5  min .",
    "the data for the thin film and additional details are available elsewhere.@xcite , width=324 ]    the chemical compositions and the physical properties of all samples were established by a suite of techniques , which yielded rb@xmath4ni@xmath5[cr(cn)@xmath6@xmath7h@xmath8o.@xcite for the magnetization measurements , a commercial ( quantum design ) magnetometer was used in conjunction with a home - made _ in situ _",
    "rotator.@xcite the powder samples were mounted in gelcaps , while the film samples were either cut and stacked in a plastic box or measured individually in a straw holder .",
    "a single 400 cycles film , a stack of ten 40 cycles films , and @xmath25  @xmath2 g of powder embedded in eicosane were employed for the cw - esr measurements performed at either 50 ghz or 116 ghz , using a resonant cavity coupled to a cryostat and superconducting magnet at the nhmfl - tallahassee.@xcite transmission and reflection x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) studies were performed at 20 k , 110 k , and 300 k by using the instruments at the university of guelph .",
    "care was taken to avoid long term vacuum pumping of the sample at room temperature , since variations due to reversible dehydration - hydration@xcite were observed as the ( 200 ) peak shifted to higher @xmath31 and broadened .",
    "data were collected for nominally 24 h at each temperature , and a blank melinex film was also measured to assist with the background subtraction arising from the solid support .    , is shown for various temperatures for the powder and the thick ( 2 @xmath2 m ) film for @xmath32 to the surface of the film .",

    "the anisotropic magnetic response in prussian blue analogues was initially observed in magnetization measurements,@xcite and this behavior is shown for the rb - ni - cr films in figs .",
    "1 and 2 . differences between the zfc and fc data are related to a spin - glass - like response,@xcite while the anisotropy of the thin and thick films is strikingly similar as the external magnetic field is applied parallel or perpendicular to the surface of the films , hereafter referred to as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "this behavior is also present , albeit to a somewhat weaker degree , in spin - cast samples@xcite but is not observed in films that were synthesized in a manner that corrupts their two - dimensional nature by generating discontinuities and roughness.@xcite     to the surface of the film .",

    "( b ) angular dependences of the positions of the main ( closed symbols ) and weak ( open symbols ) esr absorption lines at 116 ghz ( round symbols and left scale ) and at 50 ghz ( square symbols and right scale ) .",
    "the @xmath32 orientations are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively.,width=324 ]    to date , esr investigations of prussian blue analogues have been limited to the rb - mn - fe system that ferromagnetically orders near 10  k.@xcite in our work , the nature of the anisotropy was explored , and the 116  ghz results for the powder and 2  @xmath2 m film are shown in fig .",
    "3 , while the data for the 200  nm film are consistent with the trends reflected in the thicker film.@xcite one difference is that the lines of the thin film have a lorentzian shape , while the lines of the thick film have a gaussian shape , and this observation is consistent with the increase of disorder as the films become thicker . for the powder , one clear absorption line , with an effective @xmath37 ,",
    "is resolved .",
    "the response of the 2 @xmath2 m film is similar to the powder for @xmath38  k for both orientations of the applied magnetic field .",
    "however , for @xmath39 k ,",
    "the absorption signals are described by two lines , one main line that is temperature dependent and a weak line that is independent of temperature within experimental resolution . whereas the main line presumably arises from the well coupled ni@xmath26 and cr@xmath40 ions ,",
    "the weak line is associated with trace amounts of powder - sized nodules that are observed on the surfaces of the films.@xcite    at 10  k , the main and weak lines have effective g - values of 2.11 and 2.05 for @xmath33 and 1.97 and 2.05 for @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature dependences of the main line positions are shown in fig .  4 , along with the angular dependences of the main and weak lines at 50 ghz and 116 ghz for the 2@xmath2 m film at 10 k. the angular response of the main line is identical to the behavior observed for the magnetization , fig .  2 , and follows a uniaxial @xmath42 dependence , where @xmath43 is the angle between @xmath21 and the surface of the film .",
    "in addition , the angular dependence of the positions of the main lines is the same at both frequencies with a maximum variation of @xmath44  t ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "since deviations from perfect cubic symmetry@xcite might arise when the samples cool through @xmath10 , variable temperature xrd studies were performed ( fig .",
    "the ( 200 ) and ( 400 ) peaks at 17.16@xmath30 and 34.68@xmath30 were monitored in detail , and the results do not indicate any change in the lattice parameter through @xmath10 , as the _ _ fm__@xmath45_m _ ( no .  225 ) cubic symmetry is maintained with a lattice dimension of 10.33  . in transmission , the peaks at 24@xmath30 and 30@xmath30 were also assignable due to the absence of contributions from the polymer solid support in this configuration .",
    "after inspecting the comprehensive set of experimental results , several points are immediately obvious .",
    "firstly and simply stated , the films possess magnetic anisotropy that is not manifested in polycrystalline powder samples that are normally studied .",
    "secondly , the data indicate that the underlying anisotropy prevails for thin and thick films , so the anisotropy does not explicitly arise from influences coming from direct interaction with the solid support@xcite but does depend upon the two - dimensional organization of the sample generated during the film fabrication process .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath10 are independent of the orientation of the magnetic field , meaning the anisotropy does not originate from variations of the superexchange parameter , @xmath46 .",
    "thirdly , the esr results , namely the line shapes of the powder spectra and the frequency independence of the magnitude of the line splittings , can not be reconciled by the presence of an anisotropic g - tensor . finally , magnetostriction or other structural changes are not observed at any temperature , so the cubic symmetry is preserved to an extent that does not permit it to be a possible explanation of the anisotropy .    with the elimination of several common mechanisms as the possible sources of the anisotropic response , magnetostatic interactions remain as a plausible explanation .",
    "indeed , the uniaxial nature of the anisotropy is consistent with dipolar interactions .",
    "in addition , demagnetizing effects ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the demagnetizing factor ) model the data well when using the theoretical value to normalize the high field , saturation magnetization value of @xmath49 a / m , namely , @xmath50 and @xmath51.@xcite the low field magnetization in the perpendicular orientation can be reproduced quantitatively from the parallel orientation if @xmath52 and @xmath53 , fig .",
    "1a , where domains are expected to obey @xmath54.@xcite the high field magnetization can also be reproduced but not as directly , since the high field susceptibility has a significant experimental uncertainty because @xmath55 is orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath56 in this range .",
    "nevertheless , the uniformly magnetized film limit , _ vide infra _ , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 , reasonably reproduces the observed trends ( fig .",
    "the esr data can also be explained by the presence of demagnetization effects .",
    "@xcite specifically , taking the equations of motion for a spin in @xmath21 along the z - axis , the resonance condition is @xmath59[b_z+(n_x - n_z)\\mu_o m_z]\\;.\\ ] ] for a perfect sphere , @xmath60 , so the resonance condition should be isotropic and have no magnetization dependence . in practice , there may be small deviations from spherical symmetry for the powder , and the resonance condition may be written as @xmath61   \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 takes care of deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "for the powder data , figs .  2 and 3 , a shift of @xmath63",
    "mt is present in the fully magnetized state compared to the paramagnetic state .",
    "this observation is consistent with a value of @xmath64 , and the shift is similar to the one reported for rb - mn - fe,@xcite where it was attributed to demagnetizing effects . for a uniformly magnetized film oriented perpendicular to @xmath21 ,",
    "the resonance condition is @xmath65 \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] whereas for the parallel orientation , the resonance condition is @xmath66^{1/2 }    \\;\\;\\;.\\ ] ] ergo , the temperature dependence of the main lines can be predicted with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the results are in excellent agreement with the data ( fig .",
    "in summary , the observed magnetic anisotropy of the rb - ni - cr prussian blue analogue films is attributable to demagnetization effects arising from their two - dimensional geometry .",
    "additional evidence for the magnetic domain - field interactions is garnered from the extensive data sets collected on the aforementioned rb - m@xmath14-m prussian blue analogues.@xcite having identified magnetic domains as the origin of the anisotropy , additional studies , such as magnetic imaging of the surfaces , will provide a deeper understanding of the architecture and dynamics of the domains . finally , a systematic approach for determining the nature of magnetic anisotropy in coordination polymers has been presented and",
    "will be important as this class of materials is investigated for physical properties applicable to spintronic applications .",
