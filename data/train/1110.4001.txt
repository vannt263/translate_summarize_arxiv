    "the notion of attractor deserves a fundamental place in the modern theory of dynamical systems .",
    "this assertion , supported by the nowadays classical theory of turbulence @xcite , is enlightened by the recent _ palis conjecture _ @xcite about the abundance of dynamical systems with finitely many attractors absorbing most positive trajectories .",
    "if confirmed such a conjecture means the understanding of a great part of dynamical systems in the sense of their long - term behaviour .",
    "here we attack a problem which goes straight to the palis conjecture : the finitude of the number of attractors for a given dynamical system .",
    "such a problem have been solved positively under certain circunstances .",
    "for instance we have the work by lopes @xcite who , based upon early works by ma @xcite and extending previous ones by liao @xcite and pliss @xcite , studied the structure of the @xmath1 structural stable diffeomorphisms and proved the finitude of attractors for such diffeomorphisms .",
    "his work was largely extended by ma himself in the celebrated solution of the @xmath1 stability conjecture @xcite . on the other hand , the japanesse researchers s. hayashi @xcite and n. aoki @xcite studied the _",
    "star diffeomorphisms _ , i.e. , diffeomorphisms which can not be @xmath1 approximated by ones with nonhyperbolic periodic points , and proved that they are axiom a and so with only a finite number of attractors .",
    "their investigation triggered the study of the _ star flows _",
    ", i.e. , vector fields which can not be @xmath1 approximated by ones with nonhyperbolic closed orbits . indeed , although it was known from the very beginning that these flows are not necessarily axiom a @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the aforementioned works by liao and pliss proved that they display finitely many attracting closed orbits .",
    "a progress toward understanding star flows was tackled in 2003 by the author in collaboration with pacifico @xcite . indeed , these authors proved on closed @xmath0-manifolds that , except in a meager set , all such flows are singular - axiom a and so with only a finite number of attractors .",
    "soon later the chinesse authors gan and wen @xcite extended the aoki - hayashi s conclusion to nonsingular star flows on closed manifolds impliying that these flows has a finite number of attractors too . in light of these",
    "works it seems quite promissing to prove the finiteness of the number of attractors for star flows in any closed manifold .    in this paper",
    "we shall provide a result which though partial provides an insight for a positive solution of this problem . basically",
    ", we present the so - called orbit - flip homoclinic orbits as obstruction for the finiteness of attractors of star flows on closed @xmath0-manifolds . more precisely , we show that a star flow on a closed @xmath0-manifold either has a finite number of attractors or can be @xmath1 approximated by vector fields exhibiting orbit - flip homoclinic orbits . _ orbit - flip homoclinic orbits _",
    "are very rich dynamical structures which have been studied during decates @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us state this result in a precise way .",
    "hereafter @xmath2 will denote a compact connected boundaryless riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath3 ( a _ closed @xmath4-manifold _ for short ) .",
    "we shall consider a @xmath1 vector field @xmath5 in @xmath2 together with its induced one - parameter group @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the so - called flow of @xmath5 .",
    "the space of @xmath1 vector fields in @xmath2 comes equipped with the _ @xmath1-topology _ which , roughly speaking , measures the distance between vector fields and their corresponding derivatives .",
    "the long - time behavior of a point @xmath8 is often analyzed through its _ omega - limit set _ @xmath9",
    "a compact invariant set is _ transitive _ if it coincides with the omega - limit set of one of its points , whereas , in this work , an _ attractor _ will be a transitive set of the form @xmath10 for some neighborhood @xmath11 of it .",
    "the most representative example of attractors are the _ sinks _ , that is , hyperbolic closed orbits of maximal morse index .",
    "sometimes we use the term _ source _ referring to a sink for the time reversal vector field @xmath12 .    a _ homoclinic orbit _",
    "is a regular ( i.e. nonsingular ) trajectory @xmath13 which is biasymptotic to a singularity @xmath14 , namely , @xmath15 we call it _",
    "orbit - flip _ as soon as the eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath14 are real , satisfy the eigenvalue inequalities @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the _ strong unstable manifold _",
    "@xcite , is the unique invariant manifold of @xmath5 which is tangent at @xmath14 to the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue @xmath20 ( c.f .",
    "figure [ exxx ] ) .    ]    with such definitions and notations we can state our result .",
    "[ tha ] a star flow on a closed @xmath0-manifold either has a finite number of attractors or can be @xmath1 approximated by vector fields exhibiting orbit - flip homoclinic orbits .",
    "the proof relies on recent results in the theory of star flows @xcite together with some techniques resembling those in @xcite .",
    "the main theorem motivates the obvious question if star flows which can be @xmath1 approximated by vector fields with orbit - flip homoclinic orbits exist on any closed @xmath0-manifold .",
    "actually this is true but , as the reader can see by himself @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the set of such flows constitute a meager subset of star flows .",
    "we therefore conclude that every closed @xmath0-manifold comes equipped with an open and dense subset of star flows , all of whose elements have a finite number of attractors .",
    "however , it is worth noting that we can obtain exactly the same conclusion by making use of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another question is if , in the statement of the main theorem , we can replace the finitely many attractor s option by the stronger property of being singular - axiom a ( in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , such a question has negative answer as we can easily find star flows in the @xmath0-sphere which neither are singular - axiom a nor can be @xmath1 approximated by vector fields with orbit - flip homoclinic loops .",
    "finally let us mention that , in the statement of the main theorem , we can replace the term attractor by that of lyapunov stable omega - limit set ( in the spirit of @xcite ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the norm induced by a riemannian metric in @xmath2 and by @xmath22 its corresponding minimum norm . given a @xmath1 vector field @xmath5 with flow @xmath6 in @xmath2 we denote by @xmath23 the set of singularities of @xmath5 in @xmath11 and we write @xmath24 .",

    "we say that a compact invariant set is _ nontrivial _ if it does not reduce to a single closed orbit .    for any given index @xmath38 in between @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "we denote by @xmath41 the union of the hyperbolic periodic orbits @xmath37 of @xmath5 with @xmath42 for some ( and hence for all ) @xmath43 .",
    "as pointed out earlier by wen @xcite we can extended this set to include periodic orbits for nearby vector fields .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath44 the _ @xmath38-preperiodic set _ of @xmath5 consisting of those @xmath8 for which there are sequences @xmath45 and @xmath46 of vector fields and points in @xmath47 such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
