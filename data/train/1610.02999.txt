    "the relation between quark confinement and spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking has been a longstanding difficult problem remaining in qcd physics . in this paper , considering the essential role of low - lying dirac modes to chiral symmetry breaking @xcite , we derive analytical relations between the dirac modes and the confinement quantities , e.g. , the polyakov loop @xcite , its fluctuations @xcite and the string tension @xcite .",
    "we mainly use the lattice unit , @xmath0 .",
    "we use an ordinary square lattice with spacing @xmath1 and size @xmath2 , and impose the temporal periodicity / antiperiodicity for gluons / quarks . in lattice qcd , the gauge variable is expressed as the link - variable @xmath3=@xmath4 , and the simple dirac operator is given as @xmath5 where the link - variable operator @xmath6 is defined by @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "for the anti - hermitian dirac operator @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10=@xmath11 , we define the dirac mode @xmath12 and the dirac eigenvalue @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    "we here use a temporally odd - number lattice @xcite , where the temporal lattice size @xmath15 is odd . in general , only gauge - invariant quantities such as closed loops and the polyakov loop survive in qcd , according to the elitzur theorem @xcite .",
    "all the non - closed lines are gauge - variant and their expectation values are zero .",
    "now , we consider the functional trace @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and we use the completeness of the dirac mode .    from eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath18 is expressed as a sum of products of @xmath19 link - variable operators .",
    "then , @xmath18 includes many trajectories with the total length @xmath19 , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "note that all the trajectories with the odd - number length @xmath19 can not form a closed loop on the square lattice , and give gauge - variant contribution , except for the polyakov loop .",
    "thus , in @xmath20 , only the polyakov - loop can survive as the gauge - invariant component , and @xmath21 is proportional to the polyakov loop @xmath22 .",
    "actually , we can mathematically derive the following relation @xcite : @xmath23 where the last minus reflects the temporal antiperiodicity of @xmath24 @xcite .    .",
    "for each trajectory , the total length is @xmath19 , and the `` first step '' is positive temporal direction , @xmath25 .",
    "all the trajectories with the odd length @xmath19 can not form a closed loop on the square lattice , so that they are gauge - variant and give no contribution , except for the polyakov loop .",
    "thus , only the polyakov - loop component survives in @xmath21 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] . for each trajectory ,",
    "the total length is @xmath19 , and the `` first step '' is positive temporal direction , @xmath25 .",
    "all the trajectories with the odd length @xmath19 can not form a closed loop on the square lattice , so that they are gauge - variant and give no contribution , except for the polyakov loop .",
    "thus , only the polyakov - loop component survives in @xmath21 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    thus , we obtain the analytical relation between the polyakov loop @xmath26 and the dirac modes in qcd on the temporally odd - number lattice @xcite , @xmath27 which is mathematically valid in both confined and deconfined phases . from eq.([eq : main ] ) , we can investigate each dirac - mode contribution to the polyakov loop .",
    "remarkably , due to the factor @xmath28 in eq.([eq : main ] ) , low - lying dirac modes gives negligible contribution to the polyakov loop @xcite . in lattice qcd simulations ,",
    "we have numerically confirmed the relation ( [ eq : main ] ) and scarce contribution of low - lying dirac modes to the polyakov loop in both confined and deconfined phases @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the polyakov - loop fluctuations , which can be a good indicator of the qcd transition @xcite . on the temporally odd lattice ,",
    "we derive dirac - mode expansion formula for polyakov - loop fluctuations @xcite , e.g. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is chosen such that the transformed polyakov loop lies in its real sector @xcite . the damping factor",
    "@xmath32 appears in the dirac - mode sum . by removing low - lying dirac modes ,",
    "the quark condensate rapidly reduces , but the polyakov - loop fluctuation is almost unchanged @xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate the string tension and the dirac modes , using the wilson loop on @xmath33 rectangle on arbitrary square lattices with any number of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the wilson loop is expressed by the functional trace , @xmath34 for even @xmath35 ( odd @xmath35 case is similar @xcite ) , we consider the functional trace , @xmath36 similarly in sec .  3 , one can derive @xmath37 @xcite . then , the string tension @xmath38 is expressed as @xmath39 because of the factor @xmath40 in the sum , the string tension @xmath38 ( the confining force ) is to be unchanged by the removal of the low - lying dirac - mode contribution .",
    "finally , we express the polyakov loop with the eigenmodes of the wilson , the clover ( @xmath41-improved wilson ) and the domain - wall fermion kernels , where light doublers are absent @xcite . the clover fermion kernel is given as @xmath42 which becomes the wilson fermion kernel without the last term in rhs .",
    "we define eigenmodes and eigenvalues of @xmath43 as @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "we adopt the lattice with @xmath46 , and consider the functional trace , @xmath47 since the kernel @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ cfk ] ) includes many terms , @xmath48 consists of products of link - variable operators . in each product",
    ", the total number of @xmath49 does not exceed @xmath19 .",
    "each product gives a trajectory as fig .",
    "the length does not exceed @xmath19 . only the polyakov loop can form a closed loop and survives in @xmath50 . ]    among the trajectories ,",
    "however , only the polyakov loop can form a closed loop and survives in @xmath50 , and we derive @xmath51 due to @xmath52 , one finds small contribution from low - lying modes of @xmath43 to the polyakov loop .",
    "we also derive a similar formula for the domain - wall fermion .",
    "we have derived relations between the dirac modes and the confinement quantities ( the polyakov loop , its fluctuations and the string tension ) and have found scarce contribution from the low - lying dirac modes .",
    "this indicates some independence of confinement from chiral properties in qcd .",
