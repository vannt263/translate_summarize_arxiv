    "finding and understanding the infra - red structure of holographic rg flows of @xmath3 yang - mills theory and of abjm theory @xcite remains an immensely rich but rather challenging subject that still has the capacity to surprise . in this context ,",
    "gauged @xmath4 supergravity in four and five - dimensions has proven to be a very powerful tool that continues to be extremely useful and yield interesting new results .",
    "the catalog of physically interesting holographic solutions and flows that have been explicitly constructed in gauged supergravity is a very long one , whose early examples included the flows to highly non - trivial @xmath5 supersymmetric `` leigh - strassler '' fixed points @xcite and its abjm analog ( @xcite and @xcite ) , through examples of @xmath2 seiberg - witten flows @xcite , to maximally supersymmetric flows @xcite .",
    "there are many more examples , perhaps the most recent of which is the supersymmetric flow that we studied in @xcite , where the large-@xmath6 theory on a stack of m2 branes flows to a new , `` nearly conformal '' supersymmetric theory in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "one of our purposes here is to discuss these new families of flows and related janus solutions in some detail .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to highlight and explain some of the new techniques that were used in @xcite .",
    "as has been noted in many places ( see , for example , @xcite ) , finding a holographic flow solution in lower dimensions , perhaps in some consistent truncation , does not often give direct insight into the underlying physics .",
    "more specifically , a holographic flow in the lower - dimensional theory may be singular and fields may flow to infinite values .",
    "it is only when these solutions are uplifted to m theory or iib supergravity that one can give a proper interpretation of the singular behavior in terms of a distribution of branes and fluxes . in this way",
    ", singular low - dimensional solutions may actually encode very interesting physics in higher dimensions .",
    "this , of course , raises the obvious question as to why one does not simply start in the higher - dimensional theory from the outset .",
    "the answer is straightforward : the lower - dimensional theory encodes fields much more simply and computably ; complicated fluxes and metric deformations on internal manifolds become scalars described in terms of a potential .",
    "the supersymmetries may also involve these internal fluxes and geometry in non - trivial ways .",
    "the practical algorithms for solving supersymmetry variations directly in higher - dimensions therefore typically require the imposition of a high level of symmetry and supersymmetry .",
    "the power of using the low - dimensional theory and its potential structure is that one can handle solutions that have much lower levels of symmetry and supersymmetry . as will become evident ,",
    "finding the solutions that we construct here directly in m theory is a truly daunting task , even when one knows exactly where to look .",
    "the price of working in lower - dimensional gauged supergravity is that it describes a very restricted family of deformations .",
    "on the other hand they are some of the most interesting deformations since they are dual to marginal and relevant operators .",
    "what is surprising is that even after fifteen years since the first holographic flows in gauged supergravity @xcite , there are still interesting new physical flows to be found ( like the one in @xcite ) and new janus solutions that can be constructed explicitly in gauged supergravity ( like those in @xcite ) .",
    "since gauged supergravity continues to give us new very interesting , physical solutions , while their interpretation usually requires the `` uplift '' to m theory or iib supergravity , it becomes ever more important to understand and develop the precise relationships between the gauged supergravity in low dimensions and the higher - dimensional supergravities .",
    "in particular , one wants to develop explicit uplift formulae that provide the exact m theory of iib solution in terms of the gauged supergravity fields .",
    "there is also a vast literature on this subject and there has also been some remarkable progress on this in the last two or three years . for simplicity , we will only give a very brief review here and restrict our attention entirely to m theory and its relation to gauged @xmath4 supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "gauged @xmath4 supergravity in four dimensions was first constructed in @xcite and there was a great deal of subsequent work that argued how this must be related to the @xmath8-compactification of m theory .",
    "( for a review , see @xcite . )",
    "there was extensive discussion as to whether gauged supergravity was a consistent truncation or merely a low - energy effective field theory .",
    "the former is a much stronger statement in that it means that solving the equations of motion in gauged supergravity _ guarantees _ that one has also solved the equations of motion of the higher dimensional theory . over the years",
    "it has become evident that the gauged theory is indeed a consistent truncation and formulae have emerged showing precisely how gauged supergravity encodes solutions to m theory .",
    "one of the first general formula was given in @xcite where it was shown how to compute the exact deformed metric on the @xmath8 in terms of all the supergravity scalars .",
    "this knowledge alone was immensely useful in finding uplifted solutions explicitly , see for example @xcite .",
    "exact formulae for fluxes proved to be a much greater challenge .",
    "indeed , the formulae for the components of the 4-form field strength obtained as part of the original proof of consistent truncation of m  theory on @xmath8 in @xcite were prohibitively difficult to use and also suffered from an ambiguity that would lead to some components having a wrong symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that a new set of considerably more workable uplift anstze for the internal 3-form potential have been proposed in @xcite and then extended to the other components of the flux @xcite .",
    "however , explicit tests of those new formulae @xcite were confined to uplifts of simplest solutions of four - dimensional @xmath1 supergravity , namely the @xmath9 solutions for the stationary points of the potential . hence , it is important to perform non - trivial tests for solutions with varying scalar fields , such as holographic flows .    in looking at the holographic",
    "flows described in this paper and in @xcite , we first tried to find the uplift based entirely on knowing the internal metric through the formula of @xcite .",
    "this turned out to be impossible and the flux uplift formula became an essential part of constructing the flow solution .",
    "moreover , the janus solutions are intrinsically even more complicated and we certainly could not have constructed them without knowing how to uplift the fluxes .",
    "we find that the new formula to uplift the fluxes @xcite do indeed generate the exact solution .",
    "the only down - side is that they involve some heavy computations to arrive at a relatively simple result .    while our focus in this paper will be mainly on the details of how to construct the uplifts",
    ", one should not lose sight of the interesting physics of the solutions that we construct . as we described in @xcite ,",
    "our flow solutions start from a uv fixed point of m2 branes that , under a relevant perturbation , go to solutions sourced largely , or even entirely by m5 branes in the ir .",
    "unlike many flows to the ir , these flows , when uplifted , have only mild orbifold singularities .",
    "moreover , there is a special class of flows that go to pure m5 branes and can be interpreted as describing an `` almost conformal '' fixed point in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "this was the focus of our earlier paper @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will also look at janus solutions that delve into the backgrounds described by the flows and so may be interpreted as describing interfaces between phases described by the holographic ir flows .    to date",
    ", much of the discussion of janus solutions has been done directly in iib supergravity @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) or m theory @xcite . as we remarked above",
    ", such direct constructions usually require a high level of symmetry , or supersymmetry to make the computations feasible .",
    "in particular , until @xcite , there were very few ( and no ) janus solutions in m theory known .",
    "these new janus solutions were obtained in gauged supergravity and so we want to take one of the most non - trivial families of such flows and uplift to m theory so as to reveal the underlying geometric structure .    in section  [",
    "sect : truncation ] we describe sector of gauged @xmath4 supergravity upon which we will focus and describe the bps flow and janus solutions from the four - dimensional perspective . in section  [ sect : uplift ] we give the details of how this sector of gauged supergravity uplifts to m theory , while in section  [ sect : eoms ] we show how this uplifted solution solves the equations of motion in m theory .",
    "the supersymmetry structure of the solutions is studied from the eleven - dimensional perspective in section  [ sec : susy11 ] . in section [ sec : largelambda ] we return to studying the ir limits of our holographic flows and how they are related to distributions of m5 and m2 branes .",
    "we discuss general features of our solutions and how one might obtain more general families of solutions in section [ sect : general ] .",
    "section [ sect : conclusions ] contains our concluding remarks .",
    "our conventions and the tabulation of some of the more complicated formulae are given in the appendices .",
    "in this section we summarize some explicit results for the truncation of four - dimensional , @xmath4 supergravity  @xcite to the -invariant sector that we will need for the uplift to m theory in section  [ sect : uplift ] .",
    "our discussion here is based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the truncation can also be read - off from a more general @xmath10-invariant truncation in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 symmetry group of the truncation is defined by its action on the supersymmetries , @xmath12 , of the @xmath4 theory .",
    "we choose @xmath10 and the first @xmath13 to act on the indices @xmath14 , while the second @xmath13 on the indices @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to the branching @xmath16 the resulting truncation is particularly simple since , as observed in @xcite , the commutant of the symmetry group in @xmath17 consists of a single @xmath18 .",
    "the invariant fields are : the graviton , @xmath19 , the gauge field , @xmath20 , for the two @xmath13 s , a scalar , @xmath21 , and a pseudoscalar , @xmath22 .",
    "as we will describe below , this may be viewed as the bosonic sector of @xmath23 supergravity coupled to a vector multiplet .",
    "the two non - compact generators of @xmath18 in the fundamental representation of @xmath17 can be chosen as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are self - dual ( @xmath26 ) and antiself - dual ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 tensors , respectively .",
    "then the scalar ` 56-bein ' is @xmath29 where the scalar , @xmath30 , and the pseudoscalar , @xmath31 , parametrize the coset @xmath32 with the canonical complex coordinate , @xmath33 , given by @xmath34 given the explicit generators , it is easy to check that the exponential reduces to a polynomial , @xmath35 where @xmath36 note that the order of this polynomial coincides with the index of embedding of @xmath18 in @xmath17 .    using the 56-bein , it is now straightforward to obtain the full bosonic action of the truncated theory @xcite . in particular",
    ", we find that it is consistent to set the vector fields , @xmath20 , to zero .",

    "this can easily be generalized to @xmath2 supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets while still remaining within gauged @xmath4 supergravity .",
    "this truncation was considered in @xcite and the holomorphic superpotential becomes @xmath500 where the @xmath501 are the complex scalars of the three vector multiplets .",
    "our results here may be thought of as the special case with the three vector multiplets set equal and , in particular , @xmath502 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the uplift formulae will be far more complicated , but one expects that the infra - red limit will involve a more general khler manifold with a @xmath503 symmetry .",
    "it may also have some non - trivial moduli in that the @xmath489 condition may simply become a constraint on the overall phase of @xmath504 .",
    "these moduli would probably be related to the three distinct sets of m5-brane fluxes on the khler manifold .",
    "we intend to investigate this further .",
    "we have also attempted a much greater generalization in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "one starts with the uplifted flow solution and introduces rotated frames that subsume the need for the rotation by @xmath353 : @xmath505 rather remarkably one can integrate these frames in our flow solution to find new variables , @xmath506 , so that @xmath507 one can also find explicit expressions for these new coordinates : @xmath508 combined with the observation implicit in the simple and very canonical form of @xmath475 given in ( [ e10hatsimp ] ) , one finds that our flow solution has a some extra structure and , in particular , the pairing of @xmath509 and the frame in @xmath475 in the supersymmetry projectors , along with the phase dependence of the supersymmetries is very suggestive of an underlying six - dimensional complex structure .",
    "we therefore start with the @xmath506 coordinates and their associated frames .",
    "we then take the metric and fluxes to have a completely general -invariant ansatz involving arbitrary functions of @xmath506 everywhere possible .",
    "we also assume that the frame @xmath475 is universal and , in particular , take the metric ansatz to be of the form : @xmath510 e^5 & \\eql h_0(u , v)^{-{1\\over6 } } \\ , h_2(u , v ) \\ ,   dv \\,,\\qquad e^6   \\eql h_0(u , v)^{-{1\\over6 } } \\ , h_3(u , v ) \\ , v \\ , d\\theta \\,,\\\\[6 pt ] e^7 & \\eql    \\frac{1}{2}\\ , h_0(u , v)^{-{1\\over6 } } \\ , h_3(u , v ) \\ ,",

    "for the supersymmetry projectors we take @xmath513 at the outset but retain @xmath514 .",
    "we also assume that the supersymmetries have the same @xmath179- and @xmath180-dependence as in ( [ mphpseqs ] ) .",
    "note that this implies that the supersymmetry only depends on the combination @xmath515 , which appears in @xmath434 .    for the maxwell field",
    ", we take the most general -invariant potential and choose a gauge in which all the components along @xmath516 vanish : @xmath517   & ~+~ p_2 \\ ,   ( e^{6 } \\wedge e^{9 } + e^{7 } \\wedge e^{8 } ) \\wedge e^{10 } ~+~ p_3 \\ ,   ( e^{6 } \\wedge e^{9 } + e^{7 } \\wedge e^{8 } ) \\wedge e^{11 } \\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the @xmath460 and the @xmath270 s are also functions of @xmath506 .",
    "the whole point is that this ansatz at least contains our uplifted flow solution and we want to use this more general structure to understand the underlying geometry and perhaps find more general supersymmetric solutions .    to that end , one solves the supersymmetry variations to fix as many functions as possible . in @xcite",
    "the whole problem reduced to determining a single `` master function '' from which every other flux and metric function was derived .",
    "this master function itself satisfied a non - trivial , non - linear differential equation . in spite of the nice structure that we have discovered",
    ", the same kind of procedure applied here does not lead to such a simple reduction .",
    "we did , however , discover some rather general results that we will briefly summarize so as to give a flavor of what emerges .    first , we find that , _ along the flow , _ the metric functions @xmath518 and @xmath519 are all fixed algebraically in terms of @xmath520 and @xmath521 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath509 derivative of @xmath520 is simply related to @xmath520 and @xmath521 .",
    "these conditions combine to reveal that the non - compact , eight - dimensional metric transverse to the m2-branes , @xmath522 , has six - dimensional foliations , defined by the @xmath523 , the coordinate @xmath509 and the frame @xmath524 , are necessarily a @xmath525-dependent family of khler metrics . by this",
    "we mean that there is indeed a khler form , @xmath526 , on each leaf of the foliation but @xmath527 is proportional to @xmath528 : if @xmath525 were held constant , @xmath527 would indeed vanish .",
    "thus the six - dimensional khler structure apparent in the ir actually descends from a family of such structures along the flow .",
    "secondly , we find that the flux parametrized by @xmath529 is necessarily pure gauge and so we can set @xmath530 without loss of generality . the rest of the @xmath270 s satisfy a complicated system of equations that link them with @xmath354 and the remaining metric functions",
    ". ultimately one can reduce the system to show that all the unknown functions are determined in terms of _ two _ unknown functions of @xmath506 , @xmath520 and a function that we will call @xmath461 .",
    "the former satisfies an extremely complicated non - linear differential equation while @xmath461 is a pre - potential in that its derivatives determine some of the functions in the ansatz : the the @xmath509-derivative of @xmath461 gives the function @xmath512 in ( [ gend11frames ] ) while the @xmath525-derivative of @xmath461 gives @xmath531 .",
    "the remarkable fact is that @xmath461 is _ harmonic _ ( annihilated by the laplacian ) in a metric that is conformal to @xmath522 .",
    "the laplacian on @xmath522 explicitly involves @xmath520 and so the hamonicity of @xmath461 is far from simple to use in practice .",
    "we have , of course , verified that the uplifted flows do indeed satisfy these conditions but so far have not been able to simplify and elucidate the general discussion to the degree that it is worthy of presentation in this paper .",
    "the important bottom - line though is that every generalization we have considered shows the same structure for the eight - manifold transverse to the m2 branes : it consists of six - dimensional khler manifolds foliated over an @xmath447 base where one of the @xmath13 s acts as an isometry and the khler potentials depend upon the radial coordinate in this @xmath447 .",
    "on a technical level , our results represent a highly non - trivial test of the recent results on uplifting gauged @xmath4 supergravity to m theory .",
    "indeed , our discussion in section [ sect : general ] illustrates just how difficult it would be to construct the very symmetric class of flows we consider directly within eleven dimensions .",
    "more broadly , we have , once again , seen how apparently very singular `` flows to hades '' in gauged supergravity can encode some very interesting physical flows and janus solutions when lifted to m theory . results like this illustrate why it is very important to understand how gauged supergravities are encoded in higher dimensional theories .    the uplift formulae to eleven - dimensional supergravity have been well - studied and tested compared to the uplift of gauged @xmath1 supergravity in five dimensions to iib supergravity in ten dimensions .",
    "one reason might be that for quite some time only uplift formulae for the internal metric and dilaton were known @xcite and those were inferred by analogy to the m - theory result rather than proven directly .",
    "however , this has changed recently with various reformulations of type iib supergravity and the resulting uplift formulae for all fields @xcite .",
    "while there are quite a number of interesting physical examples of iib flows , it is possible that there are others yet to be discovered because they look singular from the five - dimensional perspective . given that the dual theory in @xmath532 yang - mills theory , it would be interesting to examine such flows using the new anstze that are now available .",
    "the limitation in using gauged supergravity is that one is restricted to a relatively small family of fields from the higher - dimensional perspective .",
    "fortunately the fields one has are quite a number of the simplest relevant and marginal perturbations and so one can still probe interesting physics .",
    "the limitation is most sorely felt when one tries to probe details and subtleties of the families of ir fixed points and for this gauged supergravity is too blunt an instrument . on the other hand",
    ", the uplifts of gauged supergravity solutions can give invaluable insights into the geometric structures that underlie the more general classes of flow and thus enable broader , and perhaps more physically interesting solutions to be found .",
    "this was evident for flows @xcite and so even though gauged supergravity sometimes does not describe the exact physics one wants , it can motivate and inform the search for physically interesting families of solutions .    in this spirit",
    ", we suspect that the families of flows and janus solutions considered here should admit interesting generalizations .",
    "there are the generalizations within gauged supergravity as outlined at the beginning of section [ sect : general ]",
    ". however , there should be families that involve a six - dimensional khler manifold fibered over a two - dimensional base with a @xmath13 isometry .",
    "it will probably be very challenging to use merely this information to find general flow solutions .",
    "however , we saw here that the fluxes also took on a relatively simple form and if one could understand the geometry underlying this one should be able to move towards the general class of solutions .    from the physical perspective , the flows and janus solutions we have constructed are very interesting in that they involve m2 branes polarizing and dissolving into _ non - singular _ ( except for orbifolds ) distributions of m5 branes and for one choice of parameter , flowing to a higher - dimensional , almost - conformal fixed point @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that such flows exist for any choice of parameter if one does not insist on supersymmetry .",
    "apart from the interesting holographic interpretation of these flows , this kind of mechanism also underpins the microstate geometry program in which black holes are replaced with smooth , horizonless solitonic geometries .",
    "( for reviews , see @xcite . )",
    "the basic mechanism means that the black hole undergoes a phase transition ( driven by the chern - simons interactions ) in which the singular electric charge sources are replaced my smooth magnetic fluxes . in m",
    "theory , this is realized by m2 charges being replaced by m5 fluxes .",
    "there are vast families of supersymmetric examples of this in asymptotically flat backgrounds but so far there are no examples of this process ( supersymmetric , or not ) in asymptotically @xmath9 or @xmath498 space - times .",
    "it is thus extremely helpful to have an example of such a transition and perhaps use it to understand how such a phase transition might occur more generally in asymptotically @xmath9 or @xmath498 space - times .",
    "finally , there is the question of whether there are iib analogs of the flows and janus solutions studied here .",
    "these would probably be flows in which d3 branes polarized into families of intersecting d5 branes while preserving @xmath533 supersymmetry in the field theory along the flow . such solutions might even `` flow up dimensions '' to give a compactified higher - dimensional field theories in the infra - red .",
