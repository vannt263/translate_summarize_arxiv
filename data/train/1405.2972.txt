    "as is well established , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with fully general soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking parameters is strongly constrained by flavor - violating observables . particularly in the charged lepton sector",
    "no sign of flavor violation has been observed yet .",
    "in contrast , the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath10 is a flavor - conserving leptonic observable with a tantalizing deviation @xmath11 between experiment and standard model ( sm ) prediction by more than @xmath12 , which could be explained beautifully by the contributions from light sleptons , charginos , or neutralinos . on the other hand , the feynman diagrams for susy contributions to @xmath0 and to the branching ratio of the flavor - violating decay @xmath1 , @xmath13 , are essentially identical , except for the flavor transition appearing only in the latter case .",
    "for this reason it was put forward to study correlations between the two observables in the mssm @xcite .",
    "such correlations could prove useful , for example , in constraining scenarios which are in agreement with @xmath0 .",
    "once the susy contribution to @xmath0 is fixed , the mass scale of the relevant superparticles is fixed as well .",
    "one could then predict the value of @xmath13  as a function of only the flavor - violating susy breaking parameters and thus derive stringent bounds on these parameters , which can not be evaded by simply raising the overall susy mass scale .",
    "it has already been noted in @xcite that a strong correlation could emerge if the contribution to @xmath0 comes mainly from a single diagram ; a strong correlation was also observed in @xcite in a parameter scan .",
    "the interest of the present work is to identify the parameter space where this happens .",
    "in fact , cases with a strong correlation often correspond to certain mass hierarchies among the particles involved .",
    "hence we characterize such hierarchies and establish the corresponding bounds .    on the other hand , in large parts of the mssm parameter space the susy contribution to @xmath0 is large but no single contribution to @xmath0 dominates .",
    "it is then also of interest to study to what extent the two observables are correlated and whether we can derive bounds on the flavor - violating parameters even in such cases .    motivated by the stringent lhc mass limits on colored susy particles , which in constrained scenarios imply stringent limits also on uncolored superparticles",
