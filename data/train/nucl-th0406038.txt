    "in recent years a novel approach to the nuclear matter problem based on effective field theory ( in particular chiral perturbation theory ) has emerged .",
    "its key element is a separation of long- and short - distance dynamics and an ordering scheme in powers of small momenta . at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath19@xmath3 the fermi momentum @xmath20 and the pion mass @xmath21 are comparable scales ( @xmath22 ) , and therefore pions must be included as explicit degrees of freedom in the description of the nuclear many - body dynamics .",
    "the contributions to the energy per particle @xmath23 of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter as they originate from chiral pion - nucleon dynamics have been computed up to three - loop order in refs.@xcite .",
    "both calculations are able to reproduce correctly the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter by adjusting one single parameter ( either a coupling @xmath24 @xcite or a cut - off @xmath25gev @xcite ) related to unresolved short - distance dynamics .",
    "the novel mechanism for saturation in these approaches is a repulsive contribution to the energy per particle generated by pauli - blocking in second order ( iterated ) one - pion exchange .",
    "as outlined in section 2.5 of ref.@xcite this mechanism becomes particularly transparent by taking the chiral limit @xmath26 . in that case the interaction contributions to the energy per particle are completely summarized by an attractive @xmath27-term and a repulsive @xmath28-term where the parameter - free prediction for the coefficient of the latter is very close to the one extracted from a realistic nuclear matter equation of state .",
    "the single - particle properties , represented by a complex - valued momentum and density dependent nucleon selfenergy @xmath29 , have been computed within our approach @xcite in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting potential depth @xmath30mev is in good agreement with that of the empirical nuclear shell @xcite or optical model @xcite .",
    "however , the momentum dependence of the real single - particle potential @xmath5 with its up- and downward bending ( see fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) turns out to be too strong . as a consequence",
    ", the nominal value of the effective nucleon mass at the fermi surface @xmath31 would be much too high : @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the single - particle properties around the fermi surface are decisive for the spectrum of thermal excitations and therefore they crucially influence the low temperature behavior of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the rather high critical temperature @xmath33mev for the liquid - gas phase transition obtained in ref.@xcite is a visible manifestation of this intimate relationship .",
    "while there is obviously room and need for improvement in our approach , one must also note at the same time that the single - particle properties in the scheme of lutz et al.@xcite ( where explicit short - range terms are iterated with pion - exchange ) come out completely unrealistic @xcite .",
    "the potential depth of @xmath34mev is by far too weakly attractive .",
    "most seriously , the total single - particle energy @xmath35 does not rise monotonically with the nucleon momentum @xmath7 , thus implying a negative effective nucleon mass at the fermi surface ( see fig.3 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this ruins the behavior of nuclear matter at finite temperatures since a critical temperature of @xmath36mev exceeds acceptable values by more than a factor of two .",
    "the isospin properties of nuclear matter have also been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the prediction for the asymmetry energy at saturation density @xmath37mev is in good agreement with its empirical value .",
    "however , one finds a downward bending of @xmath17 at densities @xmath38@xmath3 .",
    "such a behavior of the asymmetry energy @xmath17 is presumably not realistic .",
    "the energy per particle of pure neutron matter @xmath16 as a function of the neutron density @xmath39 shows a similar downward bending behavior ( see fig.8 in ref.@xcite ) and at lower neutron densities , there is only rough agreement with realistic neutron matter calculations . the mere fact that neutron matter came out to be unbound in ref.@xcite with no further adjusted parameter was however nontrivial .",
    "the isospin properties of nuclear matter in the scheme of lutz et al .",
    "@xcite with a second free parameter adjusted , are qualitatively the same .",
    "the dashed curves in figs.6,7 of ref.@xcite display a downward bending of @xmath40 and @xmath17 at even lower densities , @xmath41@xmath3 . an extended version of that approach with pion - exchange plus two zero - range nn - contact interactions iterated to second order and in total four adjustable parameters has been studied recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "the finding of that work is that within such a complete fourth order calculation ( thus exhausting all possible terms up - to - and - including @xmath42 ) there is no optimal set of the four short - range parameters with which one could reproduce simultaneously and accurately all semi - empirical properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the conditions for a good neutron matter equation of state and equally good single - particle properties ( and consequently a realistic finite temperature behavior ) are in fact mutually exclusive in that approach",
    ".    calculations of nuclear matter based on the universal low - momentum nucleon - nucleon potential @xmath43 have recently been performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the results obtained so far in hartree - fock or brueckner - hartree - fock approximation are unsatisfactory ( see figs.1,2 in ref.@xcite ) , since no saturation occurs in the equation of state .",
    "it has been concluded that for the potential @xmath43 the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation is applicable only at very low densities .",
    "these findings together with the identification of a successful saturation mechanism in the chiral approaches hint at the fact that the brueckner ladder does not generate all relevant medium modifications which set in already at very low densities ( typically at about one - tenth the equilibrium density of nuclear matter , corresponding to fermi momenta around @xmath44 ) .    up to this point",
    "the situation can be summarized as follows .",
    "chiral two - pion exchange restricted to nucleon intermediate states ( basically the second - order spin - spin and tensor force plus pauli blocking effects ) , together with a single ( finetuned ) contact - term representing short - distance dynamics , is already surprisingly successful in binding and saturating nuclear matter and reproducing key properties such as the asymmetry energy and the compression modulus .",
    "however , the detailed behavior of the nucleon single - particle potential and the density of states at the fermi surface are not well described at this order in the small - momentum expansion .",
    "let us also comment on the relationship between our appoach to nuclear matter and the effective field theory treatment of ( free ) nn - scattering @xcite .",
    "we are including to the respective order the same long - range components from ( one- and ) two - pion exchange .",
    "the short - range nn - contact terms are however treated differently . instead of introducing these terms in a potential which is then iterated in a lippmann - schwinger equation",
    ", we adjust their strengths ( in a perturbative calculation ) to a few empirical nuclear matter properties .",
    "the resulting values of the coupling constants are therefore not directly comparable with those of the nn - potential .",
    "we note also that the important role of chiral two - pion exchange for peripheral nn - scattering is well established @xcite .    from the point of view of the driving pion - nucleon dynamics the previously mentioned chiral calculations of nuclear matter @xcite are indeed still incomplete .",
    "they include only ( s- and ) p - wave born terms but leave out the excitation of the spin - isospin-3/2 @xmath0-resonance , which is the prominent feature of low - energy @xmath45-scattering .",
    "it is also well known that the two - pion exchange between nucleons with excitation of virtual @xmath13-isobars generates most of the needed isoscalar central nn - attraction . in phenomenological one - boson exchange models",
    "this part of the nn - interaction is often simulated by a fictitious  @xmath46-meson exchange . a parameter - free calculation of the isoscalar central potential @xmath47 generated by @xmath12-exchange with single and double @xmath13-excitation in ref.@xcite ( see fig.2 therein ) agrees almost perfectly with the phenomenological ",
    "@xmath46-exchange potential at distances @xmath48fm , but not at shorter distances .",
    "the more detailed behavior of the @xmath12-exchange isoscalar central potential with single virtual @xmath13-excitation is reminiscent of the van - der - waals potential .",
    "it has the form @xcite : @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the prefactor includes the spin - isospin ( axial ) polarizability of the nucleon @xcite , @xmath51@xmath52 , from the virtual @xmath53 transition .",
    "the familiar @xmath54-dependence of the non - relativistic van - der - waals interaction emerges in the chiral limit , @xmath26 .",
    "a consideration of mass scales also suggests to include the @xmath55-isobar as an explicit degree of freedom in nuclear matter calculations .",
    "the delta - nucleon mass splitting of @xmath56mev is comparable to the fermi momentum @xmath57mev at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "propagation effects of virtual @xmath0-isobars can therefore be resolved at the densities of interest .",
    "based on these scale arguments we adopt a calculational scheme in which we count the fermi momentum @xmath58 , the pion mass @xmath21 and the @xmath59-mass splitting @xmath13 simultaneously as  small scales  . the non - relativistic treatment of the nuclear matter many - body problem naturally goes conform with such an expansion in powers of small momenta .",
    "relativistic corrections are relegated to higher orders in this expansion scheme .",
    "the leading contributions from @xmath12-exchange with virtual @xmath13-excitation to the energy per particle ( or the single - particle potential ) are generically of fifth power in the small momenta ( @xmath60 ) . with respect to the counting in small momenta",
    "the effects from irreducible @xmath12-exchange evaluated in ref.@xcite belong to the same order .",
    "however , since the @xmath6-coupling constant is about twice as large as the @xmath61-coupling constant one can expect that the @xmath13-driven @xmath12-exchange effects are the dominant ones .",
    "the importance of @xmath0-degrees of freedom has also been pointed out in the  ab - initio  calculations of the illinois group @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a calculation of ( isospin - symmetric and isospin - asymmetric ) nuclear matter which includes systematically all effects from @xmath12-exchange with virtual @xmath13-excitation up to three - loop order in the energy density .",
    "the contributions to the energy per particle ( or the single - particle potential ) can be classified as two - body terms and three - body terms .",
    "two - body terms can be directly expressed through the nn - scattering t - matrix ( i.e. the nn - potential in momentum space ) .",
    "three - body terms on the other hand can be interpreted as pauli - blocking effects on the two - body terms imposed by the filled fermi - sea of nucleons .",
    "the notion of  three - body term  is taken here in a more general context , namely in the sense that three nucleons in the fermi sea participate in interactions .",
    "the nn t - matrix generated by the in general ultra - violet divergent pion - loop diagrams requires regularization ( and renormalization ) .",
    "we adopt here a suitably subtracted dispersion - relation representation of the t - matrix where this procedure is accounted for by a few subtraction constants .",
    "the latter constants are understood to encode unresolved short - distance nn - dynamics .",
    "the associated @xmath27- and @xmath62-terms in the energy per particle are then adjusted to some empirical property of nuclear matter ( e.g. the maximal binding energy of @xmath63mev ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we start with the equation of state of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we evaluate analytically the three - loop in - medium diagrams generated by the chiral @xmath6-dynamics and perform the necessary adjustment of short - range parameters .",
    "section 3 deals with the real single - particle potential @xmath64 whose improved momentum dependence turns out to be a true prediction . in section 4",
    "we reconsider the imaginary single - particle potential @xmath65 of ref.@xcite , but now extended into the region above the fermi surface @xmath11 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the effective nucleon mass @xmath66 and the strength function of the @xmath67-term in the nuclear energy density functional . in section 6",
    "we extend our calculation of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter to finite temperatures @xmath68 .",
    "the main interest lies there on the critical temperature @xmath69 of the first - order liquid - gas phase transition for which we find an improved value of @xmath9mev .",
    "sections 7 , 8 and 9 deal with the equation of state of pure neutron matter @xmath16 , the asymmetry energy @xmath17 and the isovector single - particle potential @xmath70 .",
    "these three quantities reveal the isospin properties of the underlying @xmath71-dynamics .",
    "explicit inclusion of the @xmath0-degree of freedom leads to a substantial improvement : the notorious downward bending of @xmath16 and @xmath17 observed in previous chiral calculations is now eliminated .",
    "finally , section 10 ends with a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "we start the discussion with the equation of state of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter for which one has a fairly good knowledge of the empirical saturation point .",
    "we first write down the contributions to the energy per particle @xmath23 as they arise from @xmath12-exchange with single and double virtual @xmath13-isobar excitation .",

    "fig.1 shows the relevant one - loop triangle , box and crossed box diagrams contributing to the nn t - matrix ( or the momentum space potential ) .",
    "the finite parts of these diagrams have been evaluated analytically in section 3 of ref.@xcite employing the usual non - relativistic @xmath72 transition vertices and @xmath13-propagator ( see eq.(4 ) in ref.@xcite ) . by closing the two open nucleon lines to either two rings or one ring one gets ( in diagrammatic representation ) the hartree or fock contribution to the energy density of nuclear matter .",
    "the hartree contribution to the energy per particle evidently goes linear with the nucleon density @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 with @xmath75 the isoscalar central nn - amplitude at zero momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the fock contribution on the other hand is obtained by integrating the spin- and isospin - contracted t - matrix ( depending on the momentum transfer variable @xmath76 ) over the product of two fermi spheres @xmath77 of radius @xmath58 .",
    "we separate regularization dependent short - range parts in the t - matrix ( originating from the divergences of the loop diagrams ) from the unique long - range terms with the help of a twice - subtracted dispersion relation .",
