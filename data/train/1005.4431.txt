[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath15 angle can be extracted , within an 8-fold ambiguity , from an isospin analysis of @xmath16 decays , as proposed in @xcite .",

    "the global fits combining all the measurement relevant for the determination of the parameters of the @xmath0 matrix show no significant discrepancy between sets of measurements @xcite .",
    "there are some tensions at the 2@xmath20 level , for example between the measured value of @xmath21 and the one predicted using the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "although not yet significant , the investigation of these discrepancies constitute one of the motivations for further pursuing the precision measurements on flavour physics at the hadronic colliders ( tevatron and lhc ) and at the next generation of @xmath23 colliders ."
