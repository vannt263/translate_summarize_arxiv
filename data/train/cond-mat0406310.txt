    "natural systems often exhibit irregular and complex behavior that at first look erratic but in fact posses scale invariant structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many cases this nontrivial structure points to long - range temporal correlations , which means that very far events are actually ( statistically ) correlated with each other .",
    "long - range correlations are usually characterized by scaling laws where the scaling exponents quantify the strength of these correlations .",
    "however , it is clear that the two - point long - range correlations reveal just one aspect of the complexity of the system under consideration and that higher order statistics is needed to fully characterized the statistical properties of the system .",
    "the two - point correlation function is usually used to quantify the scale invariant structure of time series ( long - range correlations ) , while the @xmath3-point correlation function quantifies the higher order correlations . in some cases the @xmath3-point correlation function is trivially related to the two - point correlation function , and the scaling exponents of different moments are linearly dependent on the second moment scaling exponent .",
    "these kind of processes are termed `` linear '' and `` monofractal '' , since just a single exponent that determines the two - point correlations ( and thus the linear correlations ) quantifies the entire spectrum of @xmath3 order scaling exponents . in other cases ,",
    "the relation between the @xmath3-point correlation function has nontrivial relation to the two - point correlation function , and a ( nontrivial ) spectrum of scaling exponents is needed to quantify the statistical properties of the system ; these processes are called `` nonlinear '' and `` multifractal '' .",
    "the classification into linear and nonlinear processes is important for the understandings of the underlying dynamics of natural time series and for models development .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear properties of natural time series may have practical diagnosis use  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently a simple measure for nonlinearity of time series was suggested @xcite . given a time series @xmath0 ,",
    "the correlations in the magnitude series ( volatility ) @xmath1 may be related ( in some cases ) to the nonlinear properties of the time series ; basically , when the magnitude series is correlated the time series @xmath0 is nonlinear .",
    "it was also shown that the scaling exponent of the magnitude series may be related , in some cases , to the multifractal spectrum width . however , these observations are empirical and the reasons underly these observations still remain unclear .    here",
    "we develop an analytical relation between the scaling exponent of the original time series @xmath0 and the scaling exponent of the magnitude time series @xmath1 for linear series .",
    "we show that when the original time series is nonlinear , the corresponding scaling exponent of the magnitude series is larger ( or in some cases equal ) compared to that of linear series and that the correlations in the magnitude series increase as the nonlinearity of the original series increases .",
    "these relations may help to identify nonlinear processes and quantify the nonlinearity strength . based on these results",
    "we suggest a generic model for multifractality by multiplying random signs with long - range correlated noise , and show that the multifractal spectrum width and the volatility exponent increase as these correlations become stronger .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : background ] we present some background regarding non - linear processes and magnitude ( volatility ) series correlations . in section [ sec : linear ] we develop an analytical relation between the original time series scaling exponent @xmath4 and the magnitude series exponent @xmath5 ; we confirm the analytical relation using numerical simulation .",
    "we then study in section [ sec : multifractal ] the relation between volatility correlations and the multifractal spectrum width of several multifractal models , and introduce a simple model that generates multifractal series by explicitly inserting long range correlations in the magnitude series .",
    "a summary of the results is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the long range correlations of a time series @xmath6 @xmath7 can be evaluated using the two - point correlation function @xmath8 ( @xmath9 stands for expectation value ) ; when @xmath0 is long - range correlated and stationary the two - point correlation function is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "it is possible to get good estimation of the scaling exponent using various methods , such as the power spectrum , fluctuation analysis ( fa ) @xcite , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite , wavelet transform @xcite , and others ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "the different techniques characterize the linear two point correlations in a time series with a scaling exponent which is related to the scaling exponent @xmath12 .",
    "in this study we use the fa method for the analytical derivations since this method is relatively simple . in the fa method",
    "the sequence is treated as steps of a random walk ; then the variance of its displacement , @xmath13 , is found by averaging over different time windows of length @xmath14 .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath4 of the series ( also referred to as the hurst exponent @xmath15 ) can be measured using the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the variance ; the scaling exponent @xmath4 is related to the correlation exponent @xmath12 by @xmath18 .      a more complete description of stochastic process @xmath6 with a zero mean is given by its multivariate distribution : @xmath19 .",
    "it is equivalent to the knowledge stored in the correlation functions of different orders @xcite : @xmath20 , @xmath8 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . in many cases",
    "it is useful to use the cummulants of different orders @xmath23 which are related to the @xmath3 order correlation function by @xcite : @xmath24 and so on .    for a linear process",
    "( sometimes referred to as `` gaussian '' process ) , all cummulants above the second are equal to zero ( wicks theorem ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case , the two - point correlation fully describes the process @xcite , since all correlation functions ( of positive and even order ) may be expressed as products of the two - point correlation function @xmath8 .",
    "processes that are nonlinear ( or `` multifractal '' ) have nonzero high order cummulants .",
    "the nonlinearity of these processes may be detected by measuring the multifractal spectrum @xcite using advanced techniques , such as the wavelet transform modulus maxima @xcite or the multifractal dfa ( mf - dfa ) @xcite . in mf - dfa",

    "is econometric time series @xcite .",
    "econometric time series exhibit irregular behavior such that the changes ( logarithmic increments ) in the time series have a white noise spectrum ( uncorrelated ) . nonetheless , the _ magnitudes _ of the changes exhibit long - range correlations that reflect the fact that economic markets experience quiet periods with clusters of less pronounced price fluctuations ( up and down ) , followed by more volatile periods with pronounced fluctuations ( up and down ) . this type of correlation is referred to as `` volatility correlations '' .    given a time series @xmath0 , the magnitude ( volatility ) series may be defined as @xmath29 . the scaling exponent of",
    "the magnitude series is the volatility scaling exponent @xmath5 .",
    "correlations in the magnitude series are observed to be closely related to nonlinearity and multifractality @xcite    in this paper we refer to `` volatility '' with two small differences .",
    "first , we consider the _ square _ of the series elements rather than their absolute values .",
    "according to our abservations , this transformation has negligible effect on the scaling exponent @xmath5 , but it substantially simplifies the analytical treatment .",
    "second , for simplicity , we also consider the series itself rather than the increment series .",
    "that is : the volatility series is defined as @xmath30 rather than @xmath31 .",
    "note that in most applications the absolute values of the increment series are considered instead of the absolute values of the series itself , since the original series is mostly nonstationary ( defined below ) ; here we overcome this problem by first considering stationary series .",
    "series with @xmath32 are _ stationary _ , that is , their correlation function depends only on the _ difference _ between points @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "their variance is a finite constant , that does not increase with the sequence length .",
    "sequences with @xmath36 are _ non stationary _ and have a different form of correlation function where the correlation function depends also on the absolute indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath37 ; see @xcite .",
    "scaling exponents of nonstationary series ( or series with polynomial trends ) may be calculated using methods that can eliminate constant or polynomial trends from the data @xcite .",
    "we proceed to study the relation between the volatility correlation exponent @xmath5 and the original scaling exponent @xmath4 for linear processes , both numerically and analytically .",
    "we generate artificial long - range correlated linear sequences @xmath0 with different values of @xmath4 in the range @xmath38 $ ] as follows  @xcite : ( i ) generate gaussian white noise series , ( ii ) apply fourier transform on that series , ( iii ) multiply the power spectrum @xmath39 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and ( iv ) apply inverse fourier transform .",
    "the resultant series is long - range correlated with a scaling exponent @xmath4 .",

    "= 2    the simulations indicate that the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath4 for linear series may be divided into three regions : for @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 , for @xmath45 we obtain @xmath46 , while for @xmath47 there is a transition region between those two behaviors .",
    "these results were obtained using the dfa method which can handle nonstationary time series .",
    "it is important to note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : vol_linear ] we used the absolute value of the series @xmath0 , to calculate the volatility scaling exponent .",
    "nevertheless , the usual method for calculating the volatility scaling exponent is performed by taking the absolute value of the _ differences _ series , @xmath48 , rather than @xmath0 itself @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that in many cases the given time series has an exponent in the range @xmath49 . by differentiating the sequence",
    "we get a new sequence @xmath48 with an exponent @xmath50 . according to our analysis , if the sequence is linear , the volatility exponent for this series will be @xmath51 ( whereas for the original series @xmath5 may be higher than @xmath52 even for linear data ) .",
    "thus , if the scaling exponent of the magnitude of the _ differences _ series , @xmath53 , differs from 1/2 this is an indication for nonlinearity .",
    "we note that for @xmath54 the series is highly non - stationary , i.e. , it is most of the time either above or below @xmath55 , apart from a discrete set of crossing points .",
    "the behavior of the series @xmath0 is not very different than the behavior of its absolute value @xmath1 , and therefore it is not surprising that @xmath56 .",

    "otherwise the second term , @xmath69 , is dominating and thus @xmath70 .",
    "however , the simulation results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vol_linear ] ) deviate from @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "this is because as @xmath72 , logarithmic and polynomial corrections due to strong finite size effects and non - stationarity must be taken into account in our calculations ( i.e. , the variance of the sequence depends on its length ; see appendix  [ app : finite - size ] ) .",
    "this is done by dividing @xmath73 [ eq .  ( [ equ : final_linear_terms ] ) ] by the variance of the sequence : @xmath74    this modification yields an @xmath5 that is very close to the one obtained from the numerical simulation ( in the transition region @xmath47 , and also for @xmath45 with @xmath56 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : vol_linear ] ) .",
    "the relation @xmath56 for @xmath45 can now be proved analytically : it is noticeable that the dominant scaling term of @xmath73 for the nonstationary case is proportional to @xmath69 [ eq .  ( [ equ : final_linear_terms ] ) ] .",

    "the algorithm is based on random cascades on wavelet dyadic trees .",
    "the multifractal series is constructed by building its wavelet coefficients at different scales recursively , where at each stage the coefficients of the coarser scale are multiplied by a random variable @xmath78 in order to built the coefficients of the finer scale .",

    "the multifractal spectrum @xmath79 is known analytically @xcite and by assigning @xmath83 it possible to obtain @xmath84 , @xmath85 thus , the multifractal width , @xmath86 , depends just on @xmath87 while the scaling exponent @xmath88 depends on @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath89 @xcite .    using the above algorithm , we generate multifractal time series with a fixed multifractal width @xmath90 ( by fixing @xmath87 ) and different scaling exponents @xmath91 ( by changing @xmath81 ) , and calculate their volatility exponents @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vol_multifractal ] ) @xcite .",
    "we perform the same analysis for their respective surrogate time series , which are linearized series ( after phase randomization ) that have the same two - point correlations with exponent @xmath91 as the original series @xcite ; note that @xmath27 is the @xmath3-point correlation exponent .",
    "we find that the volatility exponent @xmath5 , calculated in section [ sec : linear ] for the linear case , is the lower bound for all multifractal sequences ( studied here ) with same @xmath91 . nonetheless , for @xmath92 , i.e. , for nonstationary series , @xmath93 as in linear series .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vol_multifractal ] that for stationary time series ( @xmath94 ) , the volatility correlations increase as the multifractal spectrum width becomes wider , or alternatively , as the nonlinearity of the original series strengthens .",
    "= 2      we now propose a simple model for generating multifractal records , based on the property that multifractal series exhibit long range correlations in the volatility series .",
    "following @xcite , we multiply a long range correlated series @xmath95 ( with a scaling exponent @xmath96 ) with a series of uncorrelated random signs @xmath97 .",
    "the resultant series , @xmath98 , has a two - point correlation exponent @xmath99 because of the random signs @xmath100 .",
    "the magnitude exponent @xmath5 is the same as the magnitude exponent @xmath101 for @xmath95 , because @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig : mrw_alpha_eta_vol_width_19 ] that the multifractal width for this model increases as @xmath108 increases beyond 0.75 .    natural processes are often characterized by complex nonlinear and multifractal properties . however , the underlying mechanisms of these processes are usually not so well understood .",
    "several prototypes for multifractal processes include , e.g. , ( i ) the energy cascade model describing turbulence @xcite , ( ii ) the _ universal multifractal process _ usually used to generally explain geophysical phenomena @xcite , and ( iii ) the turbulence - like model for heart rate variability @xcite .",
    "the multifractal model described in this section is a simple model with known properties that may help to gain better understanding of multifractal processes .",
    "the model consists of two components as follows , ( i ) a random series ( which can be also any other long - range correlated series ) that may represent fast processes of a natural system , which as a first approximation may be regarded as a white noise , interacting with ( ii ) a long - range correlated process that may represents a slow modulation of the natural system .",

    "our model can also be used to model other complex systems like economy and heartbeat dynamics .",
    "we study the behavior of the magnitude series scaling exponent @xmath5 versus the original two - point scaling exponent @xmath4 for linear and nonlinear ( multifractal ) series .",

    "the results presented here provide the theory for the relation found previously @xcite between multifractality and the scaling exponent of the magnitude of the differences series ( volatility ) .",
    "this relation provides a simple method for preliminary detection and quantification of nonlinear time series , a procedure which usually requires relatively complex techniques .",
    "we also study the volatility of some known models of multifractal time series , and find that their magnitude scaling exponent is bounded from below by @xmath5 of the corresponding phase randomized linear surrogate series .",
    "based on the above findings , we propose a simple model that generates multifractality by explicitly inserting long range correlations ( @xmath96 ) into the magnitude series .",
    "this model may serve as a generic model for multifractality and may help to gain preliminary understandings of natural complex phenomena .",
    "the model , which involves interaction between fast and slow components , may represents natural fast processes that interact with slower processes .",
