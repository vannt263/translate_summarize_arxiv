    "_ e.g. _ , after a photon counting event , the atom is put in its ground state , and its subsequent transient dynamics shows damped population and coherence oscillations , which are naturally reflected by the temporal modulation of the light emission characteristics .    in this article , we consider the intensity and amplitude correlations in the fluorescence emitted by a pair of atoms that are both excited on three - level ladder transitions under electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) conditions @xcite .",
    "such atoms will emit only very little light , and since an emission event on the short - lived lower transition is accompanied by a quantum jump of the atom into the ground state , both the field intensity and amplitude will show strong transient dynamics around the rare counting events @xcite . in the absence of interactions a pair of atoms",
    "will emit light in a mutually uncorrelated manner , but as shown in @xcite , a strong interaction between two atoms which are both in the upper exited state , leads to correlations between the emitted intensities .",
    "the physical situation can be implemented with the use of highly excited rydberg states as the upper state in the level scheme shown in fig . 1 .",
    "such states have long lifetimes , and due to their large dipole moments , two nearby atoms experience a large interaction energy shift , which in turn shifts the resonance condition for the excitation of both atoms .",
    "this effective detuning may be large enough to prevent the excitation ( the rydberg blockade @xcite ) , or it may merely detune the state with two excited atoms . in either case , the eit properties are distorted and the atoms emit more light @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms have received much recent attention due to their potential application in quantum information processing @xcite where the rydberg blockade mechanism can be used to mediate controlled quantum gates @xcite .",
    "eit arises from the destructive interference between different absorption and emission processes @xcite , beneficial for slowing of light @xcite and quantum nondemolition interactions @xcite , while the rydberg blockade in combination with eit is attracting interest as it paves the road for strong cooperative optical nonlinearities @xcite .",

    "the signal amplitude shows a modulation at @xmath45 , which we ascribe to a finite dark state amplitude of the atom and due to the interaction with the transiently evolving rydberg state population of atom 1 .",

    "( 1 ) which describes the _ un - conditioned _ evolution of a system is therefore modified with the inclusion of stochastic terms to take into account the back action due to the random measurement outcomes .",
    "the immediate consequence is that the probability for a given measurement outcome is conditioned on the earlier measurement outcomes , and it is this back action dynamics that manifests itself in the temporal correlation functions in optical detection .",

    "it is worth noticing that the adjoint of a quantum jump , @xmath57 , is an upward transition transforming @xmath58 to the excited state just prior to the detection event , @xmath59 , while in intervals with no probing ( corresponding to the time between @xmath32 and @xmath33 in our correlation function calculations ) , @xmath58 solves an equation like the master equation ( 1 ) , but backwards in time and with the first of the damping terms in ( 2 ) replaced by the hermitian adjoint @xmath60 .",

    "we focus on the same cases of prior and posterior counting events from different atoms while probing now the field amplitude from the atom that caused either the first or the last count .",
    "we find that the correlations between the initial intensity measurement on one atom and the subsequent amplitude measurement on the same atom decay after a few oscillation periods in fig .",
    "6 , while the correlations involving the amplitude measurement and the last counting measurement on the same atom are undamped as a function of @xmath38 in fig .",
    "the persistent oscillations in @xmath77 over time intervals much longer than the intermediate atomic state lifetime @xmath78 , indeed have a natural explanation in terms of the past quantum state formalism in eq .",
    "( [ pqs ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath56 between the detector click at @xmath32 and the amplitude detection at time @xmath33 is governed by the usual master equation , with the initial state given by the application of the jump ( down ) operator on the steady state density matrix .",

    "all complex eigenvalues occur in such pairs since the density matrix equations can be represented by real sets of equations .",

    "we have illustrated this dependence in fig .",
    "8 , where the lower ( green dash  dotted ) and upper ( red dotted ) curves show the range of variation of the field amplitude @xmath84 around @xmath85 as a function of @xmath69 , normalized by the intensity  intensity correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath67 , @xmath86 we observe that even for very long intervals @xmath69 between the clicks , for one value of @xmath69 , the amplitude oscillates between zero and a large positive value , while for an only slightly larger @xmath69 , the oscillations occur between a correspondingly large negative value and zero .",
    "these abrupt changes follow the periodicity of the intensity  intensity correlation function , shown in fig .",
    "2 , which implies that they are rare and difficult to observe .",
    "while the persistent oscillations in figs . 5 and 7 follow from the above eigenvalue argument , we need to explain why the oscillations in figs . 4 and 6 are damped .",
    "the results in figs .",
    "47 are all obtained by solution of the same differential equations , but the conditioning counting events impose boundary conditions that strongly influence the observed dynamics . after counting a photon from atom 1 ,",
    "the density matrix factorizes into a product state @xmath87 , where the conditioned state @xmath88 of atom 2 depends on the steady state of the joint system , attained prior to the jump . just before the counting of a photon from atom 2 at time @xmath67",
    ", the matrix @xmath58 acquires the form @xmath89 , _",
    "i.e. , _ it factorizes into a product of the identity matrix @xmath90 acting on the atom 1 hilbert space and the excited state projector of atom 2 .    to understand why these limiting conditions lead to the observed correlations , we consider for simplicity the evolution between @xmath32 and @xmath67 in the absence of the rydberg interaction .",
    "the matrices pertaining to the separate atoms then evolve independently , and while the three terms , @xmath91 , @xmath88 and @xmath92 all develop damped oscillatory dynamics , the identity matrix @xmath90 is invariant under the backward time evolution of the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that according to eq .",
    "( [ pqs ] ) the outcome probabilities for measurements on atom 1 between 0 and @xmath69 are given by the usual density matrix expression and hence they undergo the usual damping towards steady state . in our argument about eigenvalues , the terms in the evolution of @xmath0 , damped as @xmath80 , are not multiplied by the matching functions @xmath93 because @xmath90 is the zero eigenvalue solution of the backward evolution equation .",
    "the interaction between the atoms of course modifies the argument , but the solutions change and the factorization becomes invalid only gradually as the equations are integrated over time .",
    "in summary , we have studied photon correlations in signals emitted by a pair of interacting atoms .",
    "the interaction significantly alters the dark states of the individual atoms , and the optical response is correspondingly large",
    ". this may pave the way for the use of photon correlation measurements as a probe of the rydberg interaction strength , and , ultimately we may use the detection of fluorescence from one atom to herald the emission of a nonclassical state of light by the other atom .",
    "the correlations reveal a host of interesting results .",
    "in particular , we find strong correlations between counting events on one atom and field amplitude measurements on the same and on the other atom .",
    "we observe a strong asymmetry between negative and positive time correlations and ascribe this to the different boundary conditions for the equations of motion : an earlier photon count is accompanied by a jump into the ground state , while a later count event specifies the matrix @xmath58 to populate the short - lived excited state , and these states have different expansions on the eigenstates of the ladder system hamiltonian .",
    "three - time correlation functions show oscillatory behaviour as function of the intermediate time argument @xmath33 between counting events at times @xmath32 and @xmath67 , and these turn out to be undamped for times much longer than the lifetimes of the atomic states .",
    "this result is a consequence of the post selection by the last detection event , and it is explained quantitatively by the contribution of exponentially damped terms with both time arguments @xmath38 and @xmath94 .",
    "interestingly , due to the conditions imposed by the detection events , this phenomenon occurs for some but not all combinations of correlation functions of the emission signals from two atoms .    our work focused on pairs of atoms , but we imagine that coherent ensemble emission from rydberg blocked ensembles and from atoms with more complex level structure ( e.g. , excited from a larger zeeman and hyperfine ground state manifold ) @xcite , will show similar behavior and may lead to applications of the results presented .",
