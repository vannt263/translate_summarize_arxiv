    "the current ground - base gravitational wave detectors such as ligo , tama300 , geo600 and virgo  @xcite are now starting the  science run \" and the laser space antenna for gravitational waves(lisa )  @xcite may operate in the near future .",
    "gravitational waves will bring us various new information about relativistic astrophysical objects .",
    "if we will detect gravitational waves and compare them with theoretical templates , we may be able to determine a variety of astrophysical parameters of the sources such as their direction , distance , masses , spin , and so on .",
    "the direct observation of gravitational waves could resolve strong - gravitational phenomena such as a black hole formation .",
    "furthermore , we may be able not only to verify the theory of gravity but also to find new information or to recover new physics at high density or high energy region .",
    "therefore we need to make theoretical templates of gravitational waves from various astrophysical objects and phenomena to extract useful information from gravitational waves .",
    "there are a lot of astrophysical objects and phenomena as gravitational wave sources , e.g. , a closed binary system or a supernova explosion .",
    "many attempts to study their templates have been done so far . in this paper , we particularly focus on a gravitational waves form a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "it is motivated as follows .",
    "chaos appears universally in nature and it is expected to explain various nonlinear phenomena . because chaos indicates unpredictability of motion of objects , it comes into a question whether or not that it is possible to extract useful information from a chaotic system .",
    "many studies have been made on chaos in mechanics and astrophysics since the research on the three - body problem by poncar .",
    "it is also important to study chaos in general relativity because the einstein equations are nonlinear .",
    "many authors have reported chaos in general relativity  @xcite . as for a realistic astrophysical object , there has been a discussion whether or not chaos occurs in a compact binary system  @xcite .",
    "it seems that there is not enough time in a compact binary for chaos to occur even in a non - integrable system .",
    "then we may not have so far any concrete example of general relativistic chaos for a realistic situation .",
    "however , we believe that it is necessary to study chaos in general relativity . because chaos will occur in a realistic strong gravitational field described by general relativity .    in this paper , we study some observational feature of chaos in general relativistic dynamical system .",
    "we focus on gravitational waves from a chaotic dynamical system . as a model of a chaotic dynamical system",
    ", we adopt a spinning test particle around a rotating black hole .",
    "it mimics a model of compact objects orbiting around a super massive black hole .",
    "recent observations support the existence of such massive black holes and lisa will be sensitive to the gravitational wave from such systems . as for a background spacetime , we assume the kerr metric since such a supermassive black hole is usually rotating . the previous works  @xcite revealed that orbits of a spinning test particle around a black hole can be chaotic due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we evaluate the gravitational waves emitted from this system by using multipole expansion of a gravitational field .",
    "@xcite .",
    "carter showed  @xcite that the equations of motion for a spinless particle are integrable .",
    "after his work , johnston discovered that motion for some initial parameters , the particle motion can be very complicated as if chaos occurred , although the system is integrable  @xcite .",
    "then we also analyze such non - chaotic but complicated orbital motion to clarify whether or not chaos is essential in our results .",
    "we compare the wave forms and the energy spectra of the gravitational waves from both chaotic and nonchaotic systems and analyze the effects of chaos on gravitational waves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we shall briefly review the basic equations of both a spinless particle and a spinning particle in relativistic spacetime , a supplementary condition , and some constants of motion . specifying the background spacetime to be the kerr metric , we show our results in sec .",

    "in this subsection , we summarize the equations of motion for a spinless test particle .",
    "it is well known that a spinless test particle moves along geodesic @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an affine parameter of the orbit . in a stationary axisymmetric spacetime",
    ", a spinless particle has two constants of motion ; the energy @xmath7 and the @xmath8-component of the angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the particle s rest mass @xmath10 is also constant .",
    "carter discovered third constant of motion and showed that the system is integrable  @xcite .",
    "( [ geo1 ] ) is reduced to a set of the differential equations as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a constant discovered by carter and called the carter constant .",
    "note that because of the presence of the carter constant , the orbits of a particle will never be chaotic .",
    "the equations of motion for a spinning test particle in a relativistic spacetime were first derived by papapetrou  @xcite and then reformulated by dixon  @xcite .",
    "they used the pole - dipole approximation , in which multipole moments of an object higher than a mass monopole and a spin dipole are ignored in the limit of a point particle .",
    "the set of equations is given as @xmath14 } , \\label{basic3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are an affine parameter of the orbit , the four - velocity of a particle , the momentum , and the spin tensor , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 deviates from a geodesic due to the coupling of the riemann tensor with the spin tensor .",
    "we also need an additional condition which gives a relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt the condition formulated by dixon  @xcite @xmath19 this condition consistently determines the cetnter of mass in the present system . using eq ( [ cond1 ] ) , we can determine the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 explicitly as @xmath20,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a normalization constant , which is fixed by a choice of the affine parameter @xmath6 as we will explicitly show it later .",
    "@xmath23 is a unit vector parallel to the four - momentum @xmath17 , where the mass of the particle @xmath10 is defined by @xmath24 to make clear the freedom of this system , we have to check the conserved quantities .",
    "regardless of the symmetry of the background spacetime , it is easy to show that @xmath10 and the magnitude of spin @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 are constants of motion .",
    "if a background spacetime possesses some symmetry described by a killing vector @xmath27 , @xmath28 is also conserved  @xcite . for a spacetime with both axial and timelike killing vectors such as kerr spacetime ,",
    "we have two conserved quantities , i.e. , the energy @xmath7 and the @xmath8-component of the total angular momentum @xmath29 of a spinning particle .    for numerical reasons ,",
    "we rewrite our basic equations as follows .",
    "following the appendix in  @xcite , we write down the equations by use of a spin vector @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the levi - civita tensor .",
    "the basic equations are now @xmath32 where @xmath33 eq . ( [ cond1 ] )",
    "is also rewritten @xmath34 by this condition , the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is determined as follow : @xmath35 where @xmath36 we fix the affine parameter @xmath6 using the condition @xmath37 .",
    "this gives @xmath22 as @xmath38 our conserved quantities are also rewritten as @xmath39",
    "in this section , we show our numerical results for the orbital motion of a test particle , and the wave forms and the energy spectra of the emitted gravitational waves .",
    "to analyze chaotic behavior of a test particle , we use the poincar map and the lyapunov exponent . to draw the poincar map",
    ", we adopt the equatorial plane ( @xmath40 ) as a poncar section and plot the point ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) when the particle crosses the poincar section with @xmath43 .",
    "if the motion is not chaotic , the plotted points will form a closed curve in the two dimensional @xmath41-@xmath42 plane , because a regular orbit will move on a torus in the phase space and the curve is a cross section of the torus . if the orbit is chaotic , some of these tori will be broken and the poincar map does not consist of a set of closed curves but the points will be distributed randomly in the allowed region . from the distribution of the points , we can judge whether or not the motion is chaotic .        as we see in sec [ sec : eq of spinless ] , the equations of the motion of a spinless particle are integrable because of the existence of the carter constant .",

    "the ratio of the octopole wave energy for the orbit ( b ) to that of the quadrupole wave is about 12.4 percents .",

    "however , the energy spectra of the gravitational waves show a clear difference . for a chaotic orbit , we find a continuous energy spectrum with several peaks . while , in the case of nonchaotic orbit , the spectrum contains the discrete characteristic frequencies .",
    "we also find that the higher pole moments than quadrupole moment of the system do not contribute so much to the emitted gravitational waves even for a chaotic orbit .    when the gravitational waves are detected and the energy spectrum is determined by observation , not only the astrophysical parameters , e.g. , the mass , the angular momentum , and the spin are determined but also some fundamental physics such as relativistic nonlinear dynamics could be discussed .",
    "as a future work , we have to study the gravitational waves in the dynamical system in a full relativistic approach .",
    "for the first step , using the newmann - penrose formalism  @xcite , we extend the present evaluation ( the multipole expansion ) to a full relativistic perturbation analysis .",
