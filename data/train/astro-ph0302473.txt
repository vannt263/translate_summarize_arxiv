    "since the central wavelength of the @xmath32 is bluer than that of the nb816 filter , we calculated magnitude that we refer to as the `` @xmath43 continuum '' , using a linear combination ( @xmath44 ) of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 flux densities ; a 3 @xmath45 photometric limit of @xmath46 in a @xmath42 diameter aperture .",

    "[ ha : tab : cover ] we show the different redshift coverage for each line .    in order to distinguish h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath20 from emission - line objects at other redshifts , we investigate their broad - band color properties comparing observed colors of our 1224 emitters with model ones that are estimated by using the population synthesis model gissel96 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . in figure",
    "[ ha : bricolor ] , we show the @xmath57 vs. @xmath58 color - color diagram of the 1224 sources and the loci of model galaxies .",

    "these criteria give us a sample of 348 @xmath56  emitting galaxy candidates .",
    "in particular , the first color criterion is a quite nice discriminator between h@xmath0 emitters at @xmath62 0.24 and other emitters at different redshifts and thus it is expected that there is few contamination in our sample .",
    "we adopt the same method as that used by pascual et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to calculate @xmath56  equivalent width .",
    "the flux density in each filter can be expressed as the sum of the line flux and the continuum flux density ( the line is covered by both filters ) : @xmath63 with @xmath64 the continuum flux density ; @xmath65 the line flux ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 the narrow and @xmath32 band filter effective widths and @xmath68 and @xmath69 the flux density in each filter . then the line flux , continuum flux density , and equivalent width can be expressed as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71   for the @xmath32 band and @xmath72   for the @xmath73 band .",
    "the minimum line flux in our 348 sources is @xmath74 ergs s@xmath9 and the minimum continuum flux density reaches @xmath75 ergs s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 ( @xmath76 in ab magnitude ) .      in order to obtain the h@xmath0 luminosity for each source , we correct for the presence of [ n ii]@xmath55  lines .",
    "further , we also apply a mean internal extinction correction to each object . for these two corrections",
    ", we have adopted the flux ratio of @xmath77[n ii]@xmath55@xmath78 ( obtained by kennicutt 1992a ; gallego et al .",

    "1999 ; iwamuro et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath79 .",
    "we also apply a statistical correction ( 28% ; the average value of flux decrease due to the filter transmission ) to measured flux because the filter transmission function is not square in shape .",

    "finally the @xmath56  luminosity is given by @xmath82 using the redshift of the line at the center of the filter @xmath83 and the luminosity distance , @xmath84 .",
    "in order to investigate the star formation activity in galaxies at @xmath20 , we construct the @xmath56  luminosity function ( lf ) for our h@xmath0 emitter sample by using the relation , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the comoving volume , and the sum is over galaxies with @xmath56luminosity within the interval [ @xmath87 .",
    "we take account of the filter shape in the computation of the volume",
    ". the correction can be as large as 13% for the faint galaxies",
    "[ @xmath88 ergs s@xmath9 ] as compared to that for the brightest galaxies .",
    "figure [ ha : lf ] shows the result with the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) fit to the @xmath90 @xmath56  lf measured by tm98 ( which is characterized by @xmath91 , @xmath92 mpc@xmath11 , and @xmath93 ergs s@xmath9 ; note that we convert the parameters to those of our adopted cosmology ) .",
    "fitting @xmath56  lf of @xmath94 ergs s@xmath9 with a schechter function , we find that the best - fitting parameters are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "we find that the faint end slope of our lf is steeper than that obtained by tm98 .",
    "this difference may be attributed to the different source selection procedures between tm98 and ours ; i.e. , tm98 used @xmath98-selected cfrs galaxies lying at redshift below 0.3 with the limiting magnitude of @xmath99 , while we used @xmath73-selected galaxies with the much deeper limiting magnitude of @xmath100 . in order to check this possibility ,",
    "we have made lfs of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 sources ( figure [ ha : lf_iselect ] ) , using our @xmath32-selected catalog .",
    "it is shown from this analysis that the lf for galaxies with a brighter @xmath32-band limiting magnitude tend to have a shallower faint end slope although the brightest end of lfs is not affected by the @xmath32-band limiting magnitude .",
    "the difference between lf of tm98 and our data is originated from this point .",
    "in addition to this , our survey is concentrated in a small redshift range around @xmath51 while the redshift range of tm98 is @xmath104 .",
    "this may also affect the lf shape .",
    "it should be noted that our result is consistent with that obtained by pascual et al .",
    "( 2001 ) although their data are available only for brighter objects with log @xmath105(h@xmath0 ) @xmath106 42 .",
    "the @xmath56  luminosity density is obtained by integrating the lf : @xmath107 we then find a total @xmath56  luminosity per unit comoving volume @xmath108 ergs s@xmath9 mpc@xmath11 at @xmath51 from our best fit lf .",
    "the errors quoted here are the standard deviations taking into account that the three schechter parameters are correlated .",
    "our estimate is quite similar to that obtained by pascual et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , @xmath109 ergs s@xmath9 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "not all the h@xmath0 luminosity is produced by star formation , because active galactic nuclei ( agns ) can also contribute to the luminosity .",
    "the amount of this contribution depends on the selection criteria .",
    "for example , it is 8 - 17% in the cfrs low-@xmath110 sample ( tresse et al .",
    "1996 ) , 8% in the local ucm ( gallego et al .",
    "1995 ) , and 17 - 28% in the 15r survey ( carter et al .",
    "2001 ) for the number of galaxies . following the manner of pascual et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we adopt that agns contribute to 15% of the luminosity density .",
    "we correct this agns contribution and then obtain the corrected luminosity density , @xmath111 ergs s@xmath9 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the star formation rate can be estimated from the @xmath56  luminosity using @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is in units of ergs s@xmath9 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath56  luminosity density can be translated into the sfr density of @xmath114 yr@xmath9 mpc@xmath11 ( with agn correction @xmath115 @xmath116 yr@xmath9 mpc@xmath11 ) .",
    "figure [ ha : madauplot ] shows the evolution of the sfr density from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 density measured here is higher than that of tm98 .",
