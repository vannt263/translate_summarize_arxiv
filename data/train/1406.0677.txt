    "quantum gravity is one of ultimate goals in fundamental physics",
    ". many models of quantum gravity have been proposed .",
    "some of them lead to an effective theory with noncanonical kinetic terms in the low - energy limit . in such theories",
    "the maximum speeds are different for different fields  @xcite and potentially superluminal modes appear  @xcite . meanwhile , to solve the so - called dark energy and dark matter problems , various theories of modified gravity have been proposed .",
    "some of them also involve superluminal propagations  @xcite .    in general relativity with fields having canonical kinetic terms ,",
    "the speeds of all modes are less than or equal to that of light , and then we analyze causal structures based on null curves .",
    "this is justified by the fact that any modes can not go through null hypersurfaces in a spacelike direction . however",
    ", if a theory has superluminal modes , i.e. spacelike propagations , the discussion based on null curves makes no sense .",
    "we must analyze causal structures with the fastest propagations .",
    "this is essential , for instance , in the definition of black holes .",
    "usually , we define a black hole as the outside of the chronological past of the future time infinity . here , the chronological past is defined with null curves . in contrast , if we have superluminal modes , the chronological past defined with null curves does not show the causal structures and we need to define the  chronological past \" in the sense of causality with the fastest modes .",
    "this can not be analyzed only with the metric .",
    "information regarding the propagations is needed .    with superluminal propagations ,",
    "the information loss paradox of evaporating black holes may be solved .",
    "superluminal propagations can convey the information from inside of the black hole to the outside .",
    "evaporating black holes are semiclassical objects .",
    "there , we consider the quantum effects of matter fields on classical geometry .",
    "namely , we must deal with matter fields as quantum objects , while gravity is classical .",
    "therefore , for the causal analysis of gravity , we can use classical physics , which is much easier than the discussion of quantum causality for matter fields .",
    "we expect that the property of the causal structure is similar even for quantum matter fields . in this paper , as a first step in the analysis of causal structures on evaporating black holes , we deal with the easiest modes , that is , gravitons . as a lowest - order correction of gravity theory , we consider the gauss - bonnet correction term .    gauss - bonnet gravity is a natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensional spacetime . in spite of the fact that the action has the curvature - squared terms , the equation of motion for gravity has up to the second - order derivatives of metric  @xcite , which prevents the theory from ghost excitations . moreover , the theory is interesting because it is realized in the low - energy limit of heterotic string theory  @xcite .",
    "gauss - bonnet gravity is studied in many contents , such as black holes  @xcite , braneworld model  @xcite , ads / cft correspondence  @xcite and so on  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that gauss - bonnet gravity theory involves superluminal propagation of gravitons ; this was noted in early works  @xcite and also in recent works in the context of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "however , the concrete analysis on general manifolds has not been done .",
    "the purpose of this paper is that , with less assumptions , we show generic properties of causal structures .",
    "we basically consider two cases : one is the locally stationary spacetime , and the other is spacetime with @xmath0-dimensional maximal symmetry .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ superlum ] , we show the origin of superluminality with an example of a scalar field .",
    "we also explain the relation between superluminality and acausality . in sec .",

    "[ gb ] , we define gauss - bonnet gravity which we analyze . in sec .",
    "[ cha ] , we derive the characteristic equations of gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we give the contributions stemming from the einstein - hilbert and the gauss - bonnet terms in sec .",
    "[ gene ] and in sec .",
    "[ gb ] , respectively . in sec",
    ".  [ gene ] , we also show that , in general relativity , the characteristic hypersurface for gravitons always becomes null . in sec .",
    "[ ls ] , we analyze the causal structures in stationary cases , while in sec .",
    "[ db ] we consider cases with @xmath0-dimensional maximal symmetry .",
    "finally , we summarize our work with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ sum ] .",
    "we use the following notation for indices .",
    "large latin letters @xmath3 are the indices for the @xmath4-dimensional spacetime , while greek letters @xmath5 are the indices for the @xmath6-dimensional hypersurface @xmath7 that we concentrate on . the index ",
    "@xmath8 \" means the direction which is _ not _ tangent to @xmath7 .",
    "we use the index  @xmath9 \" for the null direction on the hypersurface @xmath7 if it is null , or in sec .",
    "[ db ] for the direction which is normal to killing directions on the hypersurface @xmath7 ( roughly speaking , the radial direction in the spherically symmetric case ) .",
    "we denote the normal directions to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions by the small latin letters @xmath10 .",
    "in the standard theory , causal structures are discussed with null curves . here ,  the standard theory \" means that in the theory all the fields have canonical kinetic terms .",
    "in such a theory , the highest speeds are the same as that of light , which propagates in null direction .",
    "the causally related region , i.e. the cauchy development , is configured with the fastest propagation , and thus , we can justify the causal structures based on null curves .",
    "however , if a theory has superluminal modes , the situation becomes different .",
    "we must analyze causal structures based on the fastest propagations .",
    "now , the question is : which theory has superluminal modes .",
    "one example is gauss - bonnet gravity , where the propagations of gravitons can be superluminal on a nontrivial background .",
    "this was pointed out at the end of the 1980s  @xcite and recently discussed in the ads / cft context  @xcite .",
    "we show the reason why superluminal modes appear by using a scalar field example .",
    "we first consider a scalar field theory with a canonical kinetic term , whose equation of motion is written as @xmath11  canonical kinetic term \" means the coefficient of the kinetic term ( i.e. the second - order derivative term ) is proportional to the metric @xmath12 . to see the maximum speed of a propagation for @xmath13 , we take the high - energy limit , where we can ignore the potential term . in the fourier space ,",
    "the equation becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fourier mode of @xmath13 with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "this gives the solution that @xmath17 is null .",
    "however , if a theory has a noncanonical kinetic term , the situation changes .",
    "for instance , we consider a scalar field @xmath18 with the following equation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is another scalar field and @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "the kinetic term has the coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "taking the high frequency limit for @xmath18 , we can again neglect the potential term and in the fourier space for @xmath18 we have @xmath23 then , @xmath24 is a null direction for the effective metric @xmath22 , which is different from that for the real metric @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , with nonzero @xmath26 the fastest mode does not follow a null trajectory and can be spacelike or timelike depending on the value of @xmath21 and @xmath26 . with some values of @xmath21 and @xmath26 , the effective metric can be euclidean , or from a euclidean metric we can construct a lorentzian effective metric  @xcite .",
    "gravity theory has generically nonlinear kinetic terms , and thus , it is not trivial that the maximum speed of gravitons becomes the same as that of light . although the kinetic term looks complicated in general relativity , we can check that the kinetic term for gravitons takes the canonical form .",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ gene ] . ) however , if we consider an extension of general relativity , it can easily break the canonical structure of the kinetic terms . since the gauss - bonnet term directly gives second - order derivative terms in the equation of motion , adding it results in a nontrivial form of the kinetic terms .",
    "moreover , because general relativity is a system with constraints , even if the added terms do not have derivatives , it leads to a modification of the structures in the kinetic terms after solving the constraint equations . in massive gravity , for instance , even though the modification of general relativity is just adding mass terms , i.e. no derivative terms , superluminal modes appear  @xcite .",
    "we stress that superluminality does not directly result in acausality , which means the existence of bad causal structures such as a closed curve of propagations .",
    "if both a theory and a state have lorentz symmetry , superluminality causes acausality .",
    "if a superluminality mode exists , due to lorentz symmetry it can be adjusted to any spacelike direction and we can easily construct closed curves . however , if a state does not have lorentz symmetry , we can not use this discussion . in the above example for a scalar field ( [ scaexa ] ) , only when @xmath27 has a nonzero value , a nontrivial propagation appears .",
    "then , nonzero @xmath27 breaks the lorentz symmetry .",
    "similarly , in gauss - bonnet gravity , only if the curvature is not zero , which breaks lorentz symmetry , the propagations of gravitons become nontrivial . in such theories ,",
    "we need to check the causal structure of each solution .",
    "we briefly review the method of characteristics , which is a powerful tool for analyzing causal structures  @xcite .",
    "the method shows the hypersurface beyond which the evolution equations cease to give an unique solution .",
    "this is mathematically characterized as the hypersurface where the coefficients of the highest - order derivative with respect to its nontangent direction vanish .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as follows . to solve a @xmath28th order differential equation ,",
    "generically it is only necessary to impose @xmath28 initial conditions for up to @xmath29-th order derivatives .",
    "namely , the evolution of @xmath30th order derivatives with @xmath31 is uniquely fixed by the given initial condition for @xmath32-th order derivatives , while the evolution for the @xmath29-th order derivative , that is @xmath28th order derivative , is obtained from the equation . however",
    ", if the coefficient of the @xmath28th order derivative vanishes , we can never solve the equation for the @xmath28th order derivative , and thus , the evolution of the @xmath29-th order derivative can not be fixed .",
    "let us see the details in the case of a partial differential equation .",
    "we derive the hypersurface , denoted by @xmath7 , beyond which the evolution is not unique .",
    "such a hypersurface is called the _",
    "characteristic hypersurface_. we define a vector @xmath33 which is _ not _ tangent to @xmath7 .",
    "( usually , @xmath33 is chosen to be normal to @xmath7 for simplicity",
    ". however , it makes a null limit complicated .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we do _ not restrict _",
    "@xmath33 to be the normal vector to @xmath7 . ) suppose we have a quasilinear equation for a variable @xmath13 , does not need to be a scalar field . ]",
    "@xmath34 here , a _ quasilinear equation _ means the highest - order derivative appears linearly .",
    "this is the necessary condition for an unique evolution .. ] we decompose the equation along the lines of the arnowitt - deser - misner formalism  @xcite with the understanding that @xmath33 may be nontimelike .",
    "then , the condition of the characteristic hypersurface is that the coefficient of @xmath35 becomes zero .",
    "a characteristic hypersurface gives the edge of a cauchy development , which is related to the _ highest propagation speed_. the fastest propagation must be tangent to a characteristic hypersurface .",
    "the intuitive explanation is as follows .",
    "suppose that we solve the equation with initial conditions imposed on a hypersurface @xmath36 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ) focusing on point @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , one may say that it is the causal future of hypersurface @xmath36 , if the discussion is based on the _ light cone_. however , the causal past of @xmath37 based on all physical propagations including the superluminal modes can reach the outside of initial hypersurface @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the physics at @xmath37 is never uniquely fixed only with the information on @xmath36 and @xmath37 is located outside of the cauchy development of @xmath36 . meanwhile ,",
    "the complete initial conditions on @xmath36 fix the physics on @xmath38 uniquely , and thus , @xmath38 is in the cauchy development of @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary of the cauchy development must be described with the fastest propagation .",
    "since a characteristic hypersurface shows a boundary beyond which a dynamical equation can not be uniquely solved , it is the edge of a cauchy development .",
    "therefore , on a characteristic hypersurface the fastest propagation must propagate .     and @xmath38 based on the fastest propagation , while dotted lines show the light cone from point @xmath37 defined with null curve . ,",

    "we assume that @xmath53 does not include the highest - order derivative of the metric , and thus , it never affects the characteristics of gravitons .",

    "the first - order formalism makes the structure simpler , and thus , in accordance with the technique in refs .",
    "@xcite we develop the first - order formalism . then ,",
    "after reviewing the characteristics in general relativity , we derive the characteristics in gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .    in the discussion of characteristics , we consider the evolution from a hypersurface .",

    "for simplicity , we consider cases with a maximally symmetric @xmath151 dimensional space , where the metric can be generically written as @xmath152 ^ 2 d\\omega_{d-2}^2 \\ . \\label{met}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose both @xmath153 and @xmath154 to be future pointing null vectors ; i.e. @xmath155 is positive .",
    "@xmath156 is the @xmath151 dimensional metric that is maximally symmetric , constant and spacelike .",
    "the metric component for @xmath156 is defined as @xmath157 @xmath155 and @xmath158 are functions of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we consider a maximally symmetric @xmath151 dimensional hypersurface @xmath7 , on which @xmath161 is constant .",
    "it is convenient to use new coordinate variables @xmath162 and @xmath163 , with which the metric ( [ met ] ) is written in @xmath164 @xmath165 lies on the hypersurface @xmath7 and @xmath166 is a null vector that is never tangent to @xmath7 . for @xmath167 , @xmath168 or @xmath169 ,",
    "the hypersurface @xmath7 is spacelike , timelike or null , respectively .",
    "first of all , we show that , if @xmath170 , the hypersurface for @xmath171const is characteristic . seeing eq.([gbcharaij ] ) , we know that for @xmath172 all degeneracies are never resolved . because of the symmetry , @xmath173 must be proportional to @xmath122 , i.e. @xmath174 . since the directions labeled with @xmath108 are normal to two null vector @xmath175 and @xmath176 , we have @xmath177 therefore , @xmath170 results in @xmath178 , which gives @xmath179 , and the characteristic hypersurface is null .",
    "next , we consider cases where @xmath180 .",
    "we have @xmath174 with nonzero @xmath64 and the sign of @xmath64 is coincident with that of @xmath181 .",
    "this makes the degeneracies of eq.([gbcharaij ] ) resolved and shifts the characteristic hypersurface .",
    "since the characteristic hypersurface becomes non - null , i.e. @xmath182 , by considering the effect of shifting the hypersurface , we have a modification of eq.([gbcharaij ] ) , which is originally derived on a null hypersurface .",
    "both the einstein tensor and the gauss - bonnet term give corrections , but in regions with small curvature the correction arising from the gauss - bonnet term is negligibly small compared to that coming from the einstein tensor .",
    "therefore , we ignore the correction stemming from the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we show , by the discussion of the balance between the modifications stemming from the violation of @xmath170 and from the non - nullity of hypersurface @xmath7 , whether the hypersurface @xmath7 becomes spacelike or timelike . to see this , we only need to check the sign of @xmath183 .    for @xmath184 , the coefficients of @xmath137 in eq.([gbcharaij ] )",
    "read @xmath185 the contribution of shifting the hypersurface from null can be obtained from eq.([gmncha ] ) as @xmath186 where , as we commented , we ignore the contribution coming from the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "the degeneracy in the modified equation happens only when these two contributions cancel .",
    "namely , the condition is @xmath187 for @xmath46 the gauss - bonnet term becomes trivial , and thus @xmath4 must be larger than four .",
    "we have @xmath188 for the stability of the einstein vacuum and set @xmath189 to be positive . as a result ,",
    "the sign of @xmath183 is opposite to that of @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath181 .",
    "if the null energy condition is satisfied in the geometrical sense , that is @xmath190 where @xmath2 is",
    "any null vector is equivalent to the null energy condition defined with energy - momentum tensor @xmath191 ; however in a general gravity theory we do not have the equivalence . here ,",
    " geometrical sense \" means that the condition is the same as that rewritten in geometrical terms with the einstein equation .",
    "] , @xmath183 is always nonpositive , and thus the characteristics is timelike or null .",
    "this means that the speed of gravitons in the radial direction on a spherically symmetric spacetime and of gravitational plane waves on flat space is less than or equal to that of light .",
    "the equality happens only for @xmath192 .",
    "gravitons do not break the causal structure .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the geometrical null energy condition is violated , we potentially have superluminal modes in the radial direction .",
    "namely , for @xmath193 the characteristic becomes spacelike .",
    "there may be two possibilities for it to happen . in gauss - bonnet gravity",
    ", the null energy condition for matter fields @xmath191 does not result in the geometrical null energy condition . in the case with @xmath0-dimensional maximal symmetry , the relation between the null energy condition for matter fields and",
    "the geometrical one has been investigated  @xcite .",
    "we have two branches of solutions ; the einstein branch and the gauss - bonnet branch . the definition of the einstein branch is a sequence of solutions where the generalized misner - sharp quasilocal mass approaches to the original one in the limit as the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath21 goes to zero .",
    "if not , the solution belongs to the gauss - bonnet branch .",
    "on the einstein branch the sign of @xmath194 coincides with that of @xmath181 , while on the gauss - bonnet branch it becomes opposite .",
    "therefore , on the gauss - bonnet branch , if we impose the null energy condition on matter fields , @xmath193 can occur .",
    "the other possibility stems from the quantum effects on curved space time .",
    "considering the backreaction of the hawking radiation , we expect that the black hole is shrinking , i.e. its area is decreasing . with a decreasing area of a black hole ,",
    "it is necessary to break the geometrical null energy condition .",
    "exactly stated , we need the violation of @xmath195 for the outgoing null vector @xmath175 . as a result , for evaporating black holes ,",
    "null hypersurfaces are not the boundary of causally related region . in other words",
    ", gravitons can escape from  black holes \" defined with null curves .",
    "we have analyzed causal structures in gauss - bonnet gravity . a theory with noncanonical kinetic terms",
    "potentially has superluminal propagations .",
    "gauss - bonnet gravity is one such theory .",
    "this was pointed out at the end of the 1980s  @xcite , and that the concrete solutions having superluminal propagations was shown in refs .",
    "superluminal propagations make causal structures complicated .",
    "we should discuss causal structures based not on null curves but on the fastest modes .    to analyze causal structures , we derived the characteristic equations in sec .",
    "[ cha ] . there , we have _ not _ fixed the gauge degrees of freedom , and obtained a result consistent with refs .",
    "@xcite . in our formalism , since the vector @xmath33 is not needed to be normal to the hypersurface @xmath7 unlike in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can take the smooth limit as @xmath7 approaches to a null hypersurface .",
    "we have demonstrated that with a generic curvature the gauss - bonnet effect resolves the degeneracies of characteristic equations on null hypersurface .",
    "the resolution means that the directions of the graviton propagations are not null .    with the characteristic equations ,",
    "we have analyzed the causal structures in sec .",
    "we have discussed locally stationary cases in sec  [ ls ] . we have proved that if eqs.([sufcon ] ) are satisfied on a null hypersurface , the hypersurface is a characteristic . since on killing horizons these conditions are always satisfied , they are exactly the edges of cauchy development for gravitons .",
    "namely , on stationary spacetime , we can trust that the causal edges based on null curves and killing horizons become exactly the event horizons in the sense of causality .",
    "we have also analyzed the causal structure on solutions with @xmath151 dimensional maximal symmetry in sec .",
    "we have shown that , if the null energy condition in the geometrical sense is satisfied , the radial velocities of gravitons are less than or equal to that of light . on the einstein branch , the geometrical null energy condition holds if the null energy condition on matter fields does .",
    "since the existence of subluminal modes does not change the fact that photons have the maximum speed in the theory , it does not break the discussions of causal structures based on null curves .",
    "namely , nothing harmful appears in the sense of causality .",
    "however , with subluminal gravitons gravitational cherenkov radiation may occur .",
    "since the gauss - bonnet term appears only in higher - dimensional theory , we need to consider the compactification of higher dimensions  @xcite or the braneworld models  @xcite .",
    "they could be constrained from observational results  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the geometrical null energy condition is violated , the radial propagation of gravitons on a spherically symmetric space can be faster than light .",
    "exactly stated , if @xmath196 is satisfied for an outgoing ( or ingoing ) null vector @xmath175 , the outgoing ( ingoing ) propagations of gravitons are faster than light .",
    "it happens on the gauss - bonnet branch if we impose the null energy condition on matters , i.e. @xmath197 .",
    "moreover , if we consider the backreaction of the hawking radiation to gravity , the geometrical null energy condition should be violated .",
    "considering the backreaction of the hawking radiation , particles with energy are emitted , and thus , the mass of the black hole is decreasing .",
    "this leads to the decreasing of its area .",
    "in contrast , with the geometrical null energy condition , the area of a black hole must increase .",
    "consequently , on an evaporating black hole , we have a violation of the geometrical null energy condition .    considering some uv - complete theories , such as superstring theory",
    ", noncanonical kinetic terms appear in their effective theory . as we have demonstrated in the case of gauss - bonnet gravity , such a theory potentially has superluminal modes .",
    "superluminal modes may be one of the solutions for the information loss paradox of an evaporating black hole .",
    "when we discuss an evaporating black hole , we use the semiclassical approach of gravity .",
    "namely , we quantize matter fields , while gravity is classical .",
    "it is possibly hard to discuss the causal structure of a quantum system . using graviton propagation",
    ", we do not bother with the difficulty of quantum systems .",
    "therefore , gauss - bonnet gravity is a good objective to see the effect stemming from the noncanonical kinetic terms on an evaporating black hole .",
    "we expect that quantized matter fields have similar causal structures .",
    "we have the result that on an evaporating black hole the propagation of gravitons is faster than light .",
    "this means that classical gravitational waves can escape from a black hole that is defined by null curves .",
    "therefore , the event horizon defined with null curves is not the edge of the causal region and information can easily leak from this event horizon . in the region where curvature becomes large ,",
    "the higher curvature terms of lovelock theory  @xcite become more dominant and the causal structures are expected to be more nontrivial .",
    "conversely , superluminal modes might be prohibited by the discussion of uv completion  @xcite .",
    "if so , a large @xmath21 is forbidden because the solution with superluminal gravitons was found in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath198 with a negative cosmological constant @xmath43 in a five - dimensional spacetime . considering more general solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity",
    ", the superluminal modes could easily appear because there is no direct way to confine the geometrical energy condition from the energy condition on matter fields through the equation of motion .",
    "this may result in the end of the theory .",
    "therefore , if the existence of superluminal modes is prohibited , we need some mechanism to remove out solutions with the superluminal modes such as the gauss - bonnet branch , for instance , by revising the gravitational equation with nontrivial forms of matter actions or its coupling with gravity .",
    "the problem might be related to the nonlinear quantum instability of the einstein vacuums in gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .    in this paper , we have concentrated on gauss - bonnet gravity , which is the lowest - order correction of lovelock gravity .",
    "we expect the same property to hold in lovelock gravity and will analyze it in the future . without the stationary assumption ,",
    "we have analyzed only the metric with @xmath151 dimensional maximal symmetry , but it would be interesting to discuss more general cases , which are also our future works .",
