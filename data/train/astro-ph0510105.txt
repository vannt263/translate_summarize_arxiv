    "we are engaged in a large scale project to find additional extremely metal poor stars in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "the major existing survey for very metal - poor stars is the hk survey described in detail by beers , preston & shectman ( 1985 , 1992 ) .",
    "the stellar inventory of this survey has been scrutinized with considerable care over the past decade , but , as summarized by @xcite , only roughly 100 are believed to be extremely metal poor ( henceforth emp ) , with [ fe / h ] @xmath6 dex is given by @xmath11 on a scale where @xmath12 h atoms . then [ x / h ] = log@xmath13[n(x)/n(h ) ] @xmath14 log@xmath13[n(x)/n(h ) ] , and similarly for [ x / fe ] . ] .",
    "we are therefore exploiting the database of the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) for this purpose .",
    "the he s is an objective prism survey from which it is possible to efficiently select emp stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of a new list of candidates for emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 dex selected in an automated and unbiased manner from the he s , coupled with the very large collection area and efficient high resolution echelle spectrographs of the new generation of large telescopes , offers the possibility for a large increase in the number of emp stars known and in our understanding of their properties .",
    "we have obtained and analyzed spectra with hires @xcite at the keck i telescope of a large number of emp candidates selected from the he s .",
    "the normal procedures outlined by @xcite to isolate emp stars from the candidate lists produced by the he s were followed . in an effort to avoid selection biases ,",
    "these differ from the criteria adopted by the hk survey ; see @xcite for details .",
    "candidate emp stars selected from the he s were vetted via moderate resolution spectroscopy at large telescopes to eliminate the numerous higher abundance interlopers .",
    "most of the follow up spectra for the stars discussed here were obtained with the double spectrograph @xcite on the hale telescope at palomar mountain , denoted p200 , ( a few are from the boller and chivens spectrograph on the clay and baade telescopes at the las campanas observatory ) during the period from 2001 to the present .",
    "we intend to observe all candidates to the magnitude limit of the he s ( b @xmath9 17.5 ) in our fields ; observations are now complete in @xmath9990 deg@xmath16 , complete to b=16.5 in an additional @xmath9700 deg@xmath16 , and approaching completion in the remaining fields .",
    "these follow up spectra are used to determine an accurate measure of the metallicity of the star , much more so than is possible to derive from the low resolution objective prism spectra of the he s itself .",
    "this is accomplished via a combination of strength of absorption in h@xmath10 ( determining @xmath7 ) and in the ca  ii line at 3933    ( the kp index , which determines [ fe / h ] , once @xmath7  and hence log(@xmath17 )  are specified ) .",
    "a calibration between the strength of the indices and metallicity is required , and is generally derived from literature searches for high resolution abundance studies of relevant stars .",
    "we denote the resulting metallicity value as [ fe / h](hes ) . the specific algorithm adopted by the he s is described in @xcite and is essentially identical to that used by the hk survey until recently ;",
    "the latest updates to the algorithm as used by the hk survey are described in @xcite .",
    "stars were chosen for observation at high resolution with hires primarily on the basis of low predicted metallicity ; every star with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath18 dex north of @xmath19 was put on the hires observing list .",
    "spectra have now been obtained for more than 55 emp candidates from the he s . in all cases",
    "the stellar parameters have been determined by jgc from broad band ( v - i , v - j and v - k ) photometry and theoretical isochrones with no reference to the spectra themselves .",
    "insofar as possible , the procedures , the codes , the model atmospheres ( we use those of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the atomic data used to reduce the hires echelle spectra and to carry out the detailed abundance analysis are identical , and the analyses are thus as homogeneous as possible .",
    "@xcite present full details of the analysis and results for a large sample of emp dwarfs from the he s , while @xcite will present abundance analyses for 13 of the 16 known carbon stars from this he s sample ; two of these have not yet been observed with hires .",
    "fifteen c - normal giants have been analyzed to date , and these will appear in a future publication @xcite .",
    "our operational definition of a carbon - star ( c - star ) is one whose spectrum shows bands of c@xmath4 .",
    "the p200 dbsp spectra mostly extend to 5300   , hence the prominent c@xmath4  band at 5160    is included .",
    "we are reasonably certain , as will be discussed in @xcite , through inspection of the regions of both c@xmath4  and ch in these followup spectra , that there are no additional giant c - stars in the palomar sample .",
    "if no c@xmath4  bands are detected , but [ c / fe]@xmath20 dex , we denote a star to be c - enhanced . also we denote stars with @xmath7  @xmath21  k as `` dwarfs '' , while all cooler stars are called `` giants '' .",
    "the difference between the [ fe / h ] derived from analysis of the hires spectrum versus that obtained by applying the algorithm of @xcite to the moderate resolution follow up spectra for the set of 497 candidate emp stars with moderate resolution follow up p200 spectra is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_delta_feh ] .",
    "the giants with normal c and the warmer c - giants show good agreement ; [ fe / h](hes ) inferred from the moderate resolution spectra is a reliable indicator of the fe - metallicity found from analysis of hires spectra .",
    "getting the dwarfs correct is harder as metal lines become weaker at their higher @xmath7 .",
    "also we have adopted a @xmath7  scale for them which is hotter than that used in most earlier analyses which provided the calibration of the @xcite relation for emp dwarfs ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the mean , [ fe / h](hes ) systematically underestimates our hires - based fe - metallicity by 0.37 dex for emp dwarfs , corresponding to a systematic difference in adopted @xmath7  of @xmath9400  k.    however , fig .",
    "[ fig_delta_feh ] shows that for the cooler c - giants ( @xmath7  @xmath8  k ) , [ fe / h](hes ) substantially underestimates our hires - based fe - metallicity by @xmath91 dex .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of a systematic error of comparable size ( up to 1 dex ) for the sample of c - stars they analyzed from the hk survey .",
    "this is a very large systematic error , much too large to be caused by problems in the @xmath7  scale , and so we attempt to understand what might be causing it . in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] we show sections of the hires spectra of three emp candidates from the he s shifted into the rest frame .",
    "these stars all have @xmath7@xmath22  k. two are c - stars , the third is a genuine emp giant with weak ch .",
    "each of these stars has [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath23 dex .",
    "the red and blue continuum and the feature bandpass are shown for the kp and the hp2 indices used to determine [ fe / h](hes ) , with a feature bandpass 12    wide for each ; see @xcite for details of the index definitions .",
    "the figure clearly shows the source of the problem afflicting the c - stars  the `` continuum '' bands are full of strong molecular absorption , particularly the red continuum band for the hp2 index .",
    "if the hp2 index is underestimated because the continuum is depressed , then the star is assumed to be cooler than it actually is , and the resulting [ fe / h](hes ) for a fixed kp index will be too low .",
    "furthermore , the blue continuum region of the kp index also shows strong ch absorption ( the big chunks missing from the spectra of the c - stars in the left column blueward of the 3933    caii line ) , and hence the abundance indicator kp will also be underestimated .",
    "the derived [ fe / h](hes ) obtained using the calibration of @xcite will thus be substantially reduced below its true value for such c - stars . because the absorption in the relevant spectral regions arises from both cn and ch , the magnitude of this effect depends on additional factors such as the c - enhancement and the c / n ratio as well as on @xmath7 .",
    "several tests have been performed to verify this .",
    "first we checked that the measured kp and hp2 indices for c - stars ( and for c - normal stars ) can be reproduced to within their uncertainties from the much more precise hires spectra .",
    "we also checked that adding back the missing flux removed from the continuum by absorption in the sidebands significantly increases kp and particularly the hp2 indices above the measured values , by factors of two or more .",
    "finally we checked that by so altering the kp and hp2 indices we derive a significantly higher value for [ fe / h](hes ) which is much closer to the that obtained by the detailed abundance analyses for the cooler c - stars .",
    "an underestimate of a factor of @xmath91 dex in the deduced value of [ fe / h](hes ) for the cooler c - stars will have significant effects .",
    "[ fig_feh_vmk ] shows [ fe / h](hes ) versus v - k for a sample of 489 emp candidates from the he s with moderate resolution spectra from the double spectrograph at the hale telescope ( details will appear in * ? ? ?",
    "the 10 known c - stars and the 1 c - enhanced star with hires analyses from this sample are indicated . in the upper panel , these stars are plotted at their [ fe / h](hes ) values , while in the lower panel they are plotted at their [ fe / h](hires ) as determined from detailed abundance analyses . ] .",
    "although at their nominal fe - metallicities the c - stars dominate the population of the giants below [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath24 dex , using the results from analysis of high resolution spectra in the lower panel the frequency of c - stars among the most metal poor emp stars is considerably reduced .",
    "it is our contention that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_feh_vmk ] , this underestimate of the metallicity of the cooler c - stars by the algorithm of @xcite , used by both the he s and in the past by the hk survey , produces a spurious high frequency of c - stars among emp stars ( see fig .  [ fig_delta_feh ] ) . using the [ fe / h](hes ) values for",
    "the c - stars would yield an apparent c - star fraction of 33% for [ fe / h ] @xmath25 dex , while using the hires fe - metallicities , a value a factor of 2.4 smaller is obtained .",
    "there are 122 he s giants with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath26 dex in our sample , suggesting a c - star frequency of 7.4@xmath2% for emp stars . adding in the fraction of of c - enhanced stars among giants with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath26 dex found by @xcite of 6.5@xmath27% , one obtains a total fraction of c - rich stars with [ c / fe ] @xmath3 dex of 14@xmath5% among the giants in our he s emp sample with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath26 dex , smaller than the value of 25% for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath28 dex given by @xcite .",
    "( we have derived this fraction for the c - enhanced stars among the dwarfs in our sample with [ fe / h](hes ) @xmath26 dex ; it has the same value , as will be reported in cohen et al 2006a . )",
    "we are currently analyzing larger samples to refine this fraction .",
    "it will probably be necessary to include an indicator of the strength of the molecular bands ( most easily the g band of ch , i.e. the gp index already introduced in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the standard kp and hp2 indices in the calibration algorithm to obtain valid fe - abundances and maximum information from the he s and hk survey samples and/or to replace the hp2 index with a combination of v from the he s and j or k from 2mass ; the latter was not available at the time the hk survey defined their metallicity calibration algorithms , ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity distribution function is very sharply declining among halo stars at the lowest fe - metallicities .",
    "thus the systematic errors we have found in the calibration of the he s and by inference the hk metallicity scale of @xcite , at least until quite recently ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will also lead directly to systematic overestimates of the number of emp stars and of the yield for emp stars by these two major surveys .",
    "we are currently evaluating in detail the impact of these calibration errors on such issues .",
