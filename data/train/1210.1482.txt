    "queueing theory is one of the most important topics in the field of operations research @xcite .",
    "it has a broad spectrum of applications ranging from telecommunications to traffic engineering and supply chains .",
    "one of the simplest queueing processes is the so - called m / m/1 model , where customers enter the system with probability @xmath0 and leave the system with probability @xmath1 at one server .",
    "the current state of the m / m/1 queueing process is completely specified by the number of customers .",
    "the system converges to a stationary state with a finite number of customers when @xmath2 whereas the number of waiting customers diverges for @xmath3 .",
    "a feature which seems to be important for pedestrian queues and other traffic applications is the excluded - volume effect : pedestrians can proceed only when there is enough space in front of them @xcite .",
    "this is e.g.  seen in queues at the check - in at airports where passengers have to move the luggage when moving forward",
    ". however , standard queueing models like the m / m/1 model neglect the excluded - volume effect , and do not have a spatial structure .",
    "then the length @xmath4 of the system is given by the number of waiting customers @xmath5 ( if customers have unit length ) and the density is constant in space ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the `` exclusive queueing process '' ( eqp ) was introduced in @xcite to investigate how the excluded volume affects queues .",
    "it is obtained by modifying the input procedure of the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with the ordinary `` open boundary condition . ''",
    "customers are injected always at the end of the queue , called left end in the following , i.e.  behind the last customer waiting ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual open tasep where the input always happens at the same site , irrespective of the occupation of the other sites .",
    "the output is not changed compared to the usual open tasep : in both models customers are extracted at the right end ( the server ) which is fixed .",
    "the eqp is not the only variant of the tasep on a dynamic lattice .",
    "an earlier example is the dynamically extending exclusion process ( deep ) introduced in @xcite as a model for fungal growth .",
    "in contrast to the eqp , the deep has no mechanism for reducing the system length and therefore the length of the system is always diverging .",
    "other possible biological applications are length - regulation of microtubules @xcite and bacterial flagellar growth @xcite .",
    "the state space of the eqp is the set of configurations of the customers .",
    "it is more precisely given as @xmath7 where @xmath8 for @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath10 corresponds to the customer configuration where each site @xmath11 is occupied or empty according to @xmath12 or 0 , and @xmath4 defines the length of the system .",
    "the symbol @xmath13 corresponds to the state `` no customer in the system . ''",
    "we denote the number of customers ( @xmath14 ) by @xmath5 for a given state @xmath15 .",
    "each customer enters the system , hops and leaves the system as @xmath16 the local update rules ( [ eq - localrules ] ) are not sufficient to specify the dynamics fully .",
    "in addition the sequence in which the rules are applied to the sites or particles needs to be defined .",
    "here we consider two discrete - time updates ( parallel and backward sequential updates ) and a continuous - time dynamics where the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath17 are transition rates ( not probabilities ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "exact stationary states for the continuous - time case and the parallel - update case were constructed as matrix product states based on the known forms for the corresponding taseps with a fixed length @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary between the convergent and divergent phases was found to be modified compared to the classical m / m/1 queue . in particular , for the convergence to the stationary states , the injection rate ( or probability ) @xmath0 can not be bigger than the maximal current of the tasep , i.e. `` the queue itself is a bottleneck '' as well as the server .    in @xcite ,",
    "the phase diagram was analyzed in more detail .",
    "the convergent and divergent phases are both further subdivided in two subphases analogous to the maximal current and high - density phases of the tasep .",
    "furthermore time dependent properties were investigated .",
    "however the asymptotic form of the velocity for the growth of @xmath4 in the divergent phase was left as an open problem .",
    "in this article we will clarify this point , giving density profiles with help of monte carlo simulations .",
    "( in the case where the customer hopping is deterministic @xmath18 , an exact `` dynamical state '' in matrix product form exists which enables us to rigorously derive the behavior of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite . )    this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : update - rules ] , we define the eqps with various updates in more detail .",
    "the phase diagrams are derived and their relation with classical queueing processes is discussed . in section  [ sec : subphases ] , based on simulation results we characterize further subphases of the divergent phases according to the shapes of the density profiles . in section  [ sec : critical ] , we investigate the eqps on the critical line separating the divergent and convergent phases .",
    "finally , we give a summary and conclusions of this article in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the tasep is a prototypical model of stochastic interacting particle systems .",
    "it has been studied intensively in the last decades both from the view of nonequilibrium statistical physics @xcite and mathematics ( see e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the tasep with the ordinary open boundary condition @xcite one can study the eqp with different update schemes . in the next two subsections",
    "we define two discrete - time eqps and determine their phase diagrams .",

    "then starting from the rightmost particle and going sequentially to the left up to the leftmost particle , we move each particle forward with probability @xmath17 if possible . for example @xmath46 in the first example of transitions ( [ ref : example - back ] ) , the customer on the second site can move to the rightmost site , thanks to the backward update . on the other hand ,",
