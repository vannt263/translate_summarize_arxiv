    "the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) , originally introduced in order to describe different phenomena in condensed matter physics  @xcite , has gained new impact in the field of quantum gases  @xcite , following the experimental realization of the model in a setup with cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the prediction of a phase transition from a superfluid ( sf ) to a mott insulator ( mi ) has been confirmed .",
    "the origin of this transition is genuinely quantum , that is , it is driven by quantum fluctuations , which are controlled by the hamiltonian parameters , interaction and hopping strength , and which are present also at zero temperature .",
    "the advantages offered by cold atoms for studying quantum phase transitions are obvious : in these systems , high isolation is achievable .",
    "there have been recent advances in producing different sort of lattice configurations , determining the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "atom - atom interactions are tunable via feshbach resonances .",
    "these properties allow for using of ultracold atomic systems as quantum simulators of theoretical models that are not tractable with classical computers .",
    "although different techniques are able to capture ground state properties of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , the solution of the full model , that is complete spectrum and eigenstates , appears to be intractable with classical techniques .",
    "exact diagonalization techniques , which in principle allow for solving the full problem with high accuracy , suffer from the clear shortcoming of being restricted to fairly small many - body quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been used to study the bhm : bogoliubov techniques at small interactions  @xcite , perturbative ones at large interactions  @xcite , gutzwiller mean - field approaches  @xcite , field - theoretic studies  @xcite etc .",
    "groundstate properties can be studied by means of dmrg methods  @xcite and quantum monte - carlo techniques  @xcite .",
    "while the phase boundary is well - defined in the thermodynamic limit where symmetry - breaking gives rise to a non - zero order parameter , the situation is less unique for finite systems . in particular , as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and also pointed out in  @xcite , there is still uncertainty on the precise value of the transition from mott to superfluid in 1d systems .",
    "in particular quantum monte - carlo studies have produced sightly disagreeing results on the critical value of the parameters  @xcite . in view of this , further study of the mott transition is needed , using different techniques and applying different definitions . in this work",
    "we consider small lattices which we study using direct diagonalization .",
    "this allows us to define the mi - sf transition by means of the overlap between the numerical ground state and analytical trial states for the mott and the sf phase . performing a finite size scaling of our results",
    ", we extrapolate a value for the transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "interesting new phenomena are brought into the problem by a simple modification of the model , assuming a lattice with one highly biased site attracting the atoms .",
    "this gives rise to a series of quantum phase transitions upon changing the lattice depth : for certain values , number fluctuations in the system become strong while the average number of particles on the biased site is decreased by one .",
    "finally , we consider the case of attractive interactions . similarly to the two - site case discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , strong fragmentation is found in the ground state of the system for a small attractive interaction .",
    "direct diagonalization allows us to quantitatively discuss the appearance of many - body correlations in the ground state .",
    "considering a slightly biased lattice , we study the onset of localization in the system as the attraction is increased .",
    "this work is organized as follows : the bhm is introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we introduce different quantities which we use to characterize the system behavior , such as eigenvalues of the one body density matrix , and the populations of the fock spaces .",
    "they allow us to discern if the system is condensed and to measure its spatial correlations .",
    "we also define different entropies in order to capture important properties about the system with a single scalar value . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we concentrate on systems with repulsive interactions .",
    "we obtain the @xmath0 value at which the mi - sf phase transition takes place , applying finite size scaling to our exact diagonalization results .",
    "we also study the inhomogeneous lattice , and observe several transitions as the hopping and/or interaction strengths are varied . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we turn to attractive interactions , focusing on the appearance of correlated states .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "we start with considering the standard bose - hubbard model which contains two terms : the hopping term , which allows the exchange of particles between the sites , related to the kinetic energy , and the on - site interaction term , which can be repulsive or attractive .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads , @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) creates ( annihilates ) one particle in the @xmath4th site and @xmath5 is the number of particles operator in the @xmath6th site , being @xmath7 the number of sites .",
    "a convenient basis , for fixed number of particles @xmath8 , is given by the states of the fock space restricted to @xmath8 particles , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of particles at the @xmath6th site in the state @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the labeling of the fock states .",
    "since the number of particles @xmath8 in the system is fixed , @xmath10 satisfies @xmath13 for any state @xmath11 .",
    "arbitrary states can be written in this orthogonal basis , @xmath14    for total number of particles @xmath8 and sites @xmath15 there are @xmath16 fock states in the basis .",
    "this number is the number of ways of placing @xmath8 particles in @xmath15 sites , @xmath17    we have restricted the calculations to 1d and 2d squared lattices with nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "several studies  @xcite prove that it is enough to keep the essential symmetries to reproduce the mott insulator to superfluid phase transition .",
    "then , the only nonzero contributions to the sum of the hopping in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_phi_zero ] ) come from the neighboring pairs and @xmath18 is a constant , @xmath19 .",
    "the generalization of the concept of bose - einstein condensation to interacting systems was introduced by penrose and onsager  @xcite .",
    "they established a condensation criterion in terms of the one - body density matrix ( obdm ) , @xmath20 where the field operator @xmath21 creates a boson at position @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the thermal average at temperature @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 is a hermitian matrix , it can be diagonalized .",
    "so , the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are the populations of orthogonal eigenstates .",
    "the way to find out if a given state is condensed involves the computation of the obdm and its diagonalization in order to study the magnitude of the populations of its eigenstates . in second quantization , the definition of the obdm @xmath26 of a state @xmath27 is , @xmath28 but writing the state @xmath27 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : focst_ba ] ) , we explicitly get , @xmath29 from the diagonalization of the obdm in an arbitrary basis , one obtains @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath6th largest eigenvalue of the obdm .    in order to simplify the information given by the eigenvalues of the obdm of a given state , we introduce an entropy based on the von neumann one , @xmath32 , which will be used in the following . it is defined as , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the normalized eigenvalues of the obdm .",
    "so , @xmath35 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath32 is @xmath36 and corresponds to @xmath37 .",
    "the entropy @xmath32 has a maximum which equals @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "so , its maximum value corresponds to a uniform probability distribution ( fragmented condensate  @xcite ) , whereas the minimum corresponds to a dirac-@xmath40 distribution , full condensation . in all computations",
    ", the entropy has been divided by its maximum value , @xmath38 , in order get a non - extensive quantity , bounded by @xmath36 and @xmath41 .",
    "the entropy @xmath32 measures condensation , as defined by the penrose - onsager criterion .",
    "when the value is @xmath36 , the system is condensed . when it is @xmath38 , it is completely fragmented . when the value is the logarithm of a certain integer @xmath42 , the state is fragmented in @xmath42 states .",
    "in order to quantify the correlations between the particles on different sites , we take advantage from the fact that our fock basis builds on spatially localized single particle states .",
    "we define a second entropy @xmath43 , which measures the clustering of the particles in the fock space : @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the coefficients of the decomposition of a given state into the fock basis @xmath11 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : focst_ba ] ) . in the same way as the entropy @xmath32 allowed us to distinguish between condensed and fragmented states",
    ", the entropy @xmath43 distinguishes between many - body states which are represented by a single fock state ( @xmath46 ) , and superpositions of many fock states ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "apparently , if only few fock states contribute to a many - body state , there is a high amount of spatial correlations in the system , which thus can be captured by the value of @xmath43 .",
    "the entropy @xmath43 is the von neumann entropy of the diagonal ensemble after tracing off one site .",
    "this means that it provides the von neumann entropy after a long - term time evolution in a local hamiltonian @xmath48 , with @xmath49 local energies .",
    "note that in the case of solely two - sites , the entropy @xmath43 coincides with the left - right bipartite entropy  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_phi_zero ] ) becomes exactly solvable in two limiting cases : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we take ground states in these two cases as analytical trial states for the two quantum phases exhibited by the model : the non - interacting limit provides a trial state for the sf phase , while the system without hopping yields a trial state for the mi phase .      when @xmath52 with @xmath53 , the system is ruled by the repulsive interactions , and it minimizes energy by reducing the number of pairs in each site .",
    "so , the gs of the system is a state with @xmath54 particles on each site , where @xmath42 is a positive integer , i.  e. , a mott insulator state .",
    "this corresponds to one many - body state of the fock basis and it reads , @xmath55    the first excited state looks like a mi state where a particle has been annihilated in one site and created in a different site , i.  e. , it is a quasiparticle - quasihole excitation of the mi state .",
    "when the particle is created in the @xmath6th site and the hole is localized in the @xmath4th one , the excited state reads as follows , @xmath56    the mott insulator is an insulator in the sense that the `` transport '' of one particle from one site to another one costs a finite amount of energy ( the energy gap @xmath57 ) . in the mi gs state , when @xmath42 particles are in one site ,",
    "the value of the interaction term in that site is @xmath58 . in the mi state ,",
    "a particle hops from one site to another , the value on the interaction term is @xmath59 in the site where the particle comes from and @xmath60 in the site where the particle goes .",
    "this situation coincides with the first excitation of the mi state .",
    "so , the energy difference of the mi state and its excitation is , @xmath61\\\\ & = u. \\end{split } \\label{eq : gap_mi}\\ ] ] thus , the mi phase has a characteristic energy gap @xmath62 in the energy spectrum which separates the ground state from the excitations .",
    "we consider systems at filling one , that is , @xmath63 . in the mi phase , there is one particle in each site and @xmath64 . due to the fact that in this phase the gs coincides with a single fock state , @xmath43 is zero .",
    "since the number of particles @xmath42 in each site is a well - defined integer , there are no fluctuations on the on - site number of particles in the mott phase .",
    "the mi phase also has a finite correlation length .      when @xmath65 , the hopping rules the system and each particle becomes completely delocalized over all sites of the lattice .",
    "so , we can write the single particle state as , @xmath66 since there are not interactions , the state of the whole system is a properly symmetrized product of the single particle state up to the number of particles .",
    "so , @xmath67^{n}{\\left|0\\right\\rangle } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sf}\\ ] ] then , the squared coefficients of the decomposition of the sf state into the fock basis follow a poissonian distribution in the sense that its variance @xmath68 coincides with its mean @xmath69  @xcite",
    ".        the sf state is characterized by a vanishing gap ( since there is no interaction , the only contribution to the gap comes from the hopping term ) , large fluctuations in the on - site number of particles and a divergent correlation function . in the sf phase , all the particles are delocalized , that is , each one of them has the same probability of presence in all sites of the lattice , without interacting each other .",
    "since all the particles in the system have the same single particle wavefunction , the system is condensed and so , @xmath70 .",
    "the sf state involves many fock states with a non - uniform poissonian distribution .",
    "the entropy @xmath43 , defined in eq .  ( [ eq : sb ] ) , is larger than in the mott phase , but it will never equal @xmath41 because the distribution is not uniform .",
    "increasing the number of particles in the system , the value of the entropy @xmath43 in the sf phase decreases .",
    "in contrast to @xmath32 , the entropy @xmath43 does not exhibit an extremal value . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we will encounter cases where the distribution of coefficients is more uniform , giving rise to even larger values of @xmath43 .      by means of direct diagonalization , we are able to find the exact ground state for small bose - hubbard systems",
    ". we will now compare these ground states with the analytical solution of the system in the cases @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , we compute the overlap between gs and trial states as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath73 note that , for finite systems , this overlap is never expected to be zero , since the two trial states become orthogonal only in the thermodynamic limit . analytically , we find @xmath74     is plotted as a function of @xmath75 for a 1d system with periodic boundary .",
    "the fitting to the analytical form , @xmath76 has been made with the nonlinear least - squares marquardt - levenberg algorithm .",
    "this fit is used to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit as explained in the text . ]    nevertheless , the overlap @xmath77 can determine the phase transition by looking for the value @xmath0 where both overlaps , for the mi and the sf phase , are equal , see fig .  [",
    "fig : sfimi_pbc ] .",
    "we denote this value by @xmath78 , as it depends on the number of particles @xmath8 . performing a finite size study  @xcite",
    ", we can extrapolate the critical value in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath79 .",
    "we assume a size - dependency given by @xmath80 , and perform the a finite size study for the 1d systems in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_stud_siz ] .",
    "the extrapolated value for the phase transition in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath81 , or , @xmath82 with a reduced @xmath83 .",
    "it agrees with the values in the literature , cf .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "concretely , this value is placed in the bose - hubbard hamiltonian phase diagram between the curve of the three - order strong - coupling expansion  @xcite and the curve from density - matrix renormalization - group calculations  @xcite .",
    "this accuracy could be expected , since we have exactly diagonalized the whole hamiltonian without imposing any restriction on the hilbert space and so , without losing any correlations .",
    "the only bad feature could be a slow convergence with the size to the value in the thermodinamic limit and the consequent wrong extrapolation .",
    "an interesting modification of the sf to mi transition is obtained by considering a lattice with a large attractive bias . in this case the tendency to form a superfluid is suppressed , as in the limit of weak interactions the particles prefer to localize on the biased site . increasing repulsive interactions , the system reaches the mott phase , undergoing several transitions in which the number of particles on the biased site is reduced by one .",
    "the large inhomogeneity is produced by making the potential energy in the @xmath84th site much lower than the others .",
    "theoretically , we take it into account by adding the term @xmath85 to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .    to evaluate the effect of the bias potential in the system , we introduce the fluctuation of the number operator in the @xmath6th place , @xmath86 it can be written explicitly with the number operators in the fock basis .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the fock states are eigenstates of @xmath87 , the only nonzero contribution occurs when @xmath88 .",
    "so , @xmath89 ^ 2 .",

    "is depicted together with the fluctuation of the number of particles in the biased site ( red solid curve ) .",
    "the direct hopping between the @xmath91th site and the @xmath41st is not allowed and hopping between the @xmath91th and the @xmath92nd and @xmath93rd are equivalent .",
    "note the clear peaks in the number fluctuation for fixed values of @xmath0 corresponding to the transitions described in the text . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctioccnums ] , we chose @xmath94 , and study a square lattice consisting of a single plaquette , that is , four sites .",
    "accordingly , we observe @xmath95 peaks of the number fluctuations upon tuning from @xmath71 to large values of @xmath0 . in order to infer",
    "which mechanisms produces the fluctuations , we have calculated the population of each site in the lattice , simply by taking the diagonal values of the obdm , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctioccnums ] .",
    "when the fluctuation reaches a maximum , the population in the biased site decreases by one . between two consecutive fluctuation peaks ,",
    "the populations remain mainly constant , showing plateaus with a step structure .",
    "the last peak of the fluctuations , occurring at the largest value of @xmath0 , indicates a transition into the mi phase : we find that for larger values of @xmath0 , the population of all the sites takes the same integer value @xmath42 , and the fluctuation decrease monotonically to zero .",
    "the values of @xmath0 for which fluctuation maxima appear can be parameterized by @xmath96 , for @xmath97 .",
    "these values are easily explainable for the mi with @xmath98 , keeping in mind the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_phi_zero ] ) : the migration happens when the energy of keeping the particles in the same site become greater than the extracting of one particle from the biased site to place it in other site without particles , @xmath99 where we have neglected the hopping term @xmath19 , which is small compared to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the subindex @xmath102 denotes the biased site . from this equation",
    ", we obtain the condition , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a positive integer which @xmath105 .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctioccnums ] , in general the unbiased sites are not equally populated .",
    "when the interaction is large enough to expel the first particle from the biased site , the second most populated site is the one which is not directly connected to the biased site . this might appear counterintuitive in the first place , but one has to bear in mind that a particle on this site benefits from having two empty neighbors , allowing to reduce energy by tunneling processes to these sites .",
    "on the other hand , once a second particle is pushed out from the biased site , the situation changes , and two nearest neighbors of the biased site become more populated . but now , two particles occupying these two sites still can share the empty neighboring site for virtual tunneling .     of the gs in a system with attractive interactions , for 5 to 7 particles in different geometries with periodic boundaries .",
    "the plot is zoomed in order to appreciate the weakly attractive regime .",
    "in particular , it is worth emphasizing the fact that the maximum of the entropy , maximal delocalization in fock space , is not achieved for zero interaction but for slightly attractive one .",
    "the bias is @xmath106 . ]",
    "as studied for the two - site case in refs .",
    "@xcite , systems with attractive interactions feature large quantum superpositions due to the several competing single - particle ground states  @xcite .    for @xmath107 , all the particles in the system will aggregate in a single site , so the gs is the fock state with @xmath8 particles in the @xmath6th site and @xmath36 in the other sites . but",
    "this state is @xmath15-degenerate . due to this degeneracy",
    ", the ground state can be a superposition of these @xmath15 states .",
    "each one of them aggregates the system in one different site of the lattice . in this state , when a particle is fixed in one site , all the rest cluster there .",
    "so , this state is highly correlated .",
    "for the two site case , the ground state build a so - called noon state  @xcite .    in any practical implementation",
    "there will be small imperfections that will trigger small biases between the sites .",
    "it is thus expected , that for sufficiently large attractive interactions in realistic systems , the gs will be unique with all particles clustered in one site . to account for such effects , we consider a slightly biased case which favors one site , the @xmath84th .    the localized condensate ( lc ) state in the @xmath84th site of the lattice , reads , @xmath108 in this state , as in the mi , the number of particles in each site is well defined and the correlation length vanishes .",
    "different from the mi , also the energy gap vanishes , and its value is given by the value of the bias . since this state is a single state of the fock basis with all the particles localized in the same site , the values of @xmath32 and @xmath43 are both @xmath36 .",
    "it is noticed that if several sites on the lattice were biased significantly more than the rest , it could be possible to obtain a fragmented condensate .",
    "it is also possible to engineer the number of fragmented fractions by setting a number of biased sites in the lattice .    to understand the system behavior for intermediate values of the attractive interactions , we apply exact diagonalization and calculate the entropy @xmath43 as function of @xmath109 .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vn_pbc ] .",
    "the entropy has its maximum in the attractive regime , not at @xmath71 where the entropy @xmath32 exhibits a minimum .",
    "this observation implies that the gs of a weakly attractive system is more uniformly distributed over the fock basis than the gs of the sf phase . increasing the attractive interaction , but keeping the bias smaller than the gap , the system is in a cat - like state , with @xmath110 . finally , for even stronger attraction , the gap becomes smaller than the bias .",
    "then the bias term dominates and the system localizes on a single site , with a single fock state being the ground state .",
    "the phenomenon is similar to the one studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the system is found to go from a binomial distribution in fock space , to a very homogeneous one at slightly attractive interactions . further increasing the interactions ,",
    "the distribution does not become more homogeneous , but instead starts to develop peaks around each of the two - sites , which corresponds to the two superposed states of the cat - like structure . in presence of a small bias , further increasing the attractive interaction , the system localizes .",
    "we note that in the weakly attractive regime , the number of populated fock states increases when interactions are strengthened , but the distribution becomes less uniform .",
    "this behavior is more pronounced in the cases with open rather than periodic boundary conditions , as open boundary provide a natural bias with less connected sites at the edge of the system .",
    "the properties of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices has been studied both in the repulsive and attractive interaction regime .",
    "first , we have considered the repulsive case and have characterized the mi to sf transition by means of the overlap of the gs with analytical trial states . defining the transition as the parameter value at which both overlaps coincide we have been able to obtain a thermodynamic value for the transition point , in agreement with other estimates .",
    "we also study a highly biased lattice , in which one site is considerably deeper than the others . in this case",
    ", the system undergoes several transitions , from a fully localized state to a mi phase , going through partial superfluid phases , in which more and more atoms delocalized prior to localizing in the mi .",
    "the way the mi phase grows in population has been shown to proceed stepwise as the interaction is increased .    in the attractive interactions case , we have considered a small biased case , to understand the competition between attraction and localization . for sufficiently large attractive interactions , the system fully localizes due to the bias . at lower attractions ,",
    "the system develops a cat like structure .",
    "prior to this , the system goes through a state in which the number of populated fock states is maximal .    we want to thank maciej lewenstein for helpful discussions during the preparation of this article . b.",

    "<S> finally , we turn our attention to attractively interacting systems , and discuss the appearance of strongly correlated phases and the onset of localization for a slightly biased lattice . </S>"
