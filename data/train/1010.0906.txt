    "the possibility of a noncommutative ( nc ) space - time coordinates was arisen in the string theory @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the theoretical and the phenomenological aspects of the noncommutative field theory ( ncft ) has been extensively studied by many physicists @xcite . with respect to the phenomenological point of view",
    "the main question is the value of the nc - parameter that is about @xmath5 in recent works @xcite . although these bounds on the nc - parameter are usually obtained by considering the ncft at the tree level , for those works at the higher orders or from the theoretical point of view the renormalizability of the model is a crucial question .",
    "the u(n ) gauge field theories in the nc space - time are one loop renormalizable @xcite but at the higher order the uv / ir mixing causes such theories to be nonrenormalizable @xcite . meanwhile to avoid the uv / ir mixing , one can construct a @xmath0-expanded nc - quantum field theory via the seiberg - witten map @xcite .",
    "although the pure gauge sector of such a theory is renormalizable @xcite , it is shown that in general the noncommutative qed can not be renormalized by means of the seiberg - witten expansion even at the one loop @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems that @xmath0-unexpanded ncqed is more safe for the phenomenological purposes .",
    "unfortunately in this case , even in the vanishing limit of the parameter of noncommutativity , one encounters an asymptotic freedom for qed @xcite where the increasing coupling with increasing energy is well tested experimentally .",
    "furthermore , for the @xmath0-unexpanded gauge groups in the nc space - time one meets @xcite :    * only the u(n ) gauge groups in the nc space - time ( @xmath6 ) are allowed .",
    "* the fundamental and antifundamental representation of @xmath6 can only be occurred .",
    "for example , in the @xmath7 case , for arbitrary fixed charge q only the matter fields with charges @xmath8 and zero are permissible @xcite .",
    "* when we have a gauge group constructed by the direct product of several simple gauge groups , a matter field can be charged only under two of them .",
    "therefore , for instance , to construct the standard model of the particle physics ( sm ) with @xmath9 as the gauge group containing the quarks , one needs additional consideration .",
    "it is shown in reference @xcite how one can consistently reduce @xmath10 to the usual sm gauge group through a two - step appropriate higgs mechanism .",
    "the negative @xmath2-function for ncqed was obtained for matter fields with @xmath11 and zero charges besides pure qed interaction .",
    "but it is well known that in the ncft different gauge fields not only have self interactions ( three and four photon vertices in ncqed ) but also they can have interactions among each other ( for instance gluon - photon interaction ) .",
    "therefore one can ask if the @xmath2-function for ncqed after the full consideration is really negative ?",
    "in fact to answer to this question we need to consider all particles ( leptons as well as quarks ) and all gauge bosons . for this purpose to obtain the @xmath2-function for qed we explore the quantization of qed+qcd in the nc space - time and ignore the weak interaction for simplicity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we give a brief review on the @xmath1 model .",
    "3 we explore the quantization of the model and then we calculate the qed @xmath2-function in sect .",
    "4 . we summarize our results in sect .",
    "in this section we review briefly the @xmath1 model which is introduced in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 theory is described by one gauge field valued in the @xmath13 algebra , @xmath14 , and @xmath15-valued gauge fields as g_(x)=g^a_t^a,[1]in which the generators @xmath16 , are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath17 .",
    "the finite local transformations of the gauge fields are : b_=vb_v^-1 + i / g_1v_v^-1 , + g_=ug_u^-1 + i / g_3u_u^-1[2],where @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the @xmath20-product is defined as : fg(x,)=f(x,)(_^_)g(x , ) , [ a3]where @xmath21 is an antisymmetry tensor that denotes the noncommutativity of space time through = i^.then the invariant action of the @xmath22 yang - mills theory is s_ncym=-1/4d^4x ( b _ b^+ tr(g _ g^)),[3 ] in which b_= _ [ b _ ] + ig_1[b_,b _ ] _ , + g_= _ [ g _ ] + ig_3[g_,g_]_[4].the independent matter fields that can be accommodated in this model are electron in the anti - fundamental representation of @xmath13 , up quark in the fundamental representation of @xmath13 and in the anti - fundamental representation of @xmath15 , and down quark in the anti - fundamental representation of @xmath15 .",
    "meanwhile the electron neutrino can be accommodated in the adjoint representation of @xmath13 .",
    "thus the gauge transformation properties of the fermions are _",
    "e(x ) & & _",
    "e(x)v^-1(x ) , + _ _ e(x ) & & v(x)__e(x)v^-1(x ) , + _",
    "u(x ) & & v(x)_u(x)u^-1(x ) , + _",
    "d(x ) & & _ d(x)u^-1(x).[5]the gauge invariant action of this model is s_ncym = d^4x[&&|_e^d_^1_e + |__e^d_^1__e+|_u^d_^1 + 3_u + |_d^d_^3_d + & & - 1/4(b _",

    "the elements of @xmath26 can be uniquely written as u(x,)=e^i_0(x)1_ne_^i_1(x,)1_n + i_a(x,)t^a , in which the first exponential factor is a @xmath24-independent function and by multiplying two different elements of @xmath6 one can easily show that this factor group is isomorphic to the usual commutative local gauge group @xmath27 .",
    "therefore this one - dimensional representation of @xmath6 can be considered to rewrite the gauge potential @xmath28 as    a(x,)=a_0(x)1_n+ a_1(x,)1_n+ia^0_a(x,)t^a , where one can show that under @xmath6-transformation , @xmath29 transforms as the usual u(1 ) gauge field . in other words for the first step symmetry breaking",
    "a commutative scalar filed ( which was called higgsac ) is enough to reduce the extra @xmath30-field .",
    "in fact in the @xmath1 gauge theory there exist two @xmath30 factors which can be reduced to one through an appropriate higgs mechanism .",
    "this extra scalar field is charged under the both sub - groups , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the gauge transformation of the higgsac field for the first symmetry breaking is ( x ) u_3(x)(x)v_1 ^ -1(x),[8]where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , also here @xmath35 is @xmath0-independent and the multiplication is in the commutative space .",
    "therefore the gauge invariant terms including the higgsac field are d_^1 + 1(x)d_^1 + 1(x ) + m^2^(x)(x ) - ( ^(x)(x))^2,[9 ] where d_^1 + 1 = _",
    "+ ig_^ - ib_.[10]here @xmath14 and @xmath36 are the @xmath0-independent parts of their corresponding noncommutative fields .",
    "after the symmetry reduction we shall obtain a massive gauge boson , @xmath37 , and a massless one , @xmath38 .",
    "these mass eigenstates can be obtain in terms of the gauge eigenstates as follows ^&=&_13g_^-_13b _ , + a_&=&_13b_+_13g_^,[11]in which the angle @xmath3 is _ 13=^-1().[12]meanwhile the mass of @xmath37can be obtained as m^2 = ( g_1 ^ 2 + 3 2 g_3 ^ 2)^2_0,[13]where @xmath39 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath40 .",
    "although the @xmath24-independent parts of @xmath14 and @xmath36 only present in the higgsac lagrangian , we replace ( [ 11 ] ) in the full lagrangian .",
    "however we have to notice that only the @xmath24-independent parts of @xmath37 gets mass through higgsac mechanism .",
    "hereafter we use @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 . in this manner , the fermions of the @xmath1 theory couple to the massless gauge boson of the residual @xmath7 , @xmath38 , through the usual electric charges if we define 1 2 g_1_13=e,- g_3_13=q_d , where @xmath41 is the electric charge of the down quark , @xmath42 , and 1 2 ( g_1_13-g_3_13)=q_u , where @xmath43 is the electric charge of the up quark , @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the qed interactions of fermions in this model are as _ e - a_=-ie|_e^_ea_,_d - a_=-i 3 e|_d^_da_,_u - a_=e|_u^a__u-1 3 e|_u^ _ , for electron , down quark and up quark , respectively .",
    "finally , neutrinos which are the neutral particles can be coupled to photons in the nc space - time through the adjoint representation as _",
    "-a_mu =- ie|_^_.the",
    "feynman rules for this model are completely collected in appendix b.",
    "the @xmath6 is a non - abelian gauge theory for all @xmath45 , therefore we should perform the gauge fixing to have the nonsingular propagator .",
    "the faddev - popov and the gauge fixing terms for this theory are given as @xcite s_gf = d^dx(-tr(_g^_g^)+1 2 tr ( i|c_d^c - i_d^c|c ) ) , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the ghost fields and d_c=_c - ig[g_,c ] _ , in which one needs @xmath48 ghost fields for the @xmath48 gauge fields .",
    "hence for the @xmath22 gauge group there are nine ghosts for @xmath15 and one ghost for @xmath13 which can be written as s_gf&=&d^dx(-_b^_b^+1 2 ( i|c_b_d^c_b - i_d^c_b|c_b ) ) + & + & d^dx(-tr(_g^_g^)+tr ( i|c_d^c - i_d^c|c ) ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath46 are the ghost fields corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , and d_c_b&=&_c_b - ig_1[b_,c_b ] _ , + d_c&=&_c - ig_3[g_,c]_. after the symmetry reduction , as was discussed in the pervious section , the @xmath24-independent part of @xmath36 gets mass through the symmetry breaking while the @xmath0-dependent part remains massless .",
    "therefore it is necessary to take into account a ghost field corresponding to the @xmath0-dependent part of @xmath36 which we denote by @xmath52 . in the case of @xmath53",
    "the @xmath24-independent as well as @xmath24-dependent part remains massless .",
    "but the @xmath0-dependent part of @xmath53 is still non - abelian and also needs a ghost field which we denote by @xmath54 .",
    "these new ghost fields can be written in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath55 ( corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath56 ) as follows c^&=&_13c_g^-_13c_b , + c^&=&_13c_b+_13c_g^.",
    "a direct one loop calculation in the @xmath13 gauge theory for both fundamental and adjoint representation have been resulted in a negative @xmath57function @xcite .",
    "the negative contribution comes from the photon self interaction due to the nc space - time .",
    "however , in the @xmath1 gauge theory the result will be definitely different .",
    "in fact the reasons are two folds , the first one is that the charge quantization problem is solved and quarks as well as the leptons are accommodated in the theory .",
    "the second one is the appearance of the new interactions among the different gauge bosons i.e. photon and gluon , that makes the result complicated . in this section",
    "we explicitly calculate the qed @xmath2-function in the @xmath1 theory .",
    "the qed @xmath2-function can be obtained by the following relation ( e)=m(-_1+e_2+e 2 _ 3),in which @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the vertex , fermion and photon counter - terms , respectively .",
    "the one loop corrections for the electron self energy are shown in fig.1 in which fig.1(a ) corresponds to the ordinary qed",
    ". the uv divergences of these diagrams can be subtracted by the rescaling of the field and mass of the electron . the electron renormalization factor @xmath61 can be easily found as ( see appendix a , eq.([fermion ] ) ) z_^a & = & - , + z_^b & = & -(^2_13 ) , + z _ & = & 1 - ( 1 + ^2_13),[14]where @xmath62 for the space - time dimension @xmath63 . in presenting the explicit expressions of all renormalization",
    "constants the mms scheme is used throughout .",
    "the one loop contributions of the photon self energy are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the fermion loop in the fig.2(a ) can be each one of electron , neutrino , up and down quark . the main difference in each loop with respect to the ordinary space",
    "is an appearance of a phase factor depends on the nc - parameter .",
    "these factors for the charged fermions fortunately cancel each other and therefore the loop - calculations are completely like the ordinary @xmath64 .",
    "the contributions of such diagrams are ( see eq.([chargedfermion ] ) ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 means charged fermion .",
    "= 3.5 in    meanwhile the neutrino loop contribution in the photon self energy is different from the charged one , because the noncommutative phases in this case do not cancel each other .",
    "therefore for such a diagram one has ( see eq.([neutrino ] ) ) z_a^nf = -(2),[16]where",
    "@xmath67 means neutral fermion .",
    "then the total contributions from the fermion loops i.e. charged fermions ( lepton and quark ) and neutrino , are @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of generations .",
    "+ the remaining parts of the fig.2 show the gauge boson one - loop corrections to the photon self energy .",
    "the gauge boson diagrams in fig.2(b ) have singularity proportional to @xmath70 that can be canceled by those come from the diagrams given in the fig.2(c ) .",
    "in fact these diagrams have not any contribution on the @xmath57function of @xmath1 model @xcite .",
    "hence , the one loop corrections for the photon self energy which contain the photon - gluon interactions induced by the nc space - time can be obtained as ( see eq.([gauge loop ] ) )    @xmath71    therefore the total renormalization constant for the one - loop correction of the photon self energy is z_a = -[n_f -1].[19 ]      after studying the uv divergences of two point function in the @xmath1 theory , now we have to calculate the photon - electron vertex function at the one - loop level",
    ". there are four diagrams in this case as shown in the fig.3 .",
    "the three diagrams in the fig.3(b ) show the ncqed effects in the @xmath1 theory . it should be noted that here there is two additional diagrams with respect to the ncqed based on the @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath73 like diagram given in fig.3(a ) is finite unlike the ordinary @xmath73 @xcite but for the nonabelian diagrams one can easily find ( see eq.([vertex ] ) )    = 3.5 in    z_|a = -3(1 + 2 ^ 2_13 + ^2_13(1 + 2 ^ 2_13 ) - 2_132_13).[20 ] now the @xmath57function of the ncqed part of the @xmath1 gauge theory , by using ( [ 14]),([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , can be obtained as follows ( e ) = + \\{&+&n_f(1 + 2 + 33/9)+2(1 + ^2_13 ) + & -&2[(2 ) + ( 1 + ^2_13 ) + & + & ^2_13(1 + 2 ^ 2_13 ) -2 _ 132_13]},[21]where in the first term the contributions of the charged leptons , neutrinos and quarks are given separately .",
    "one should note that the neutrino has only contribution to the first term . meanwhile",
    "( [ 21 ] ) shows that the @xmath2-function depends on the mixing parameter , @xmath3 as a free parameter .",
    "in fact the @xmath2 , depending on the value of @xmath3 can be negative , positive or even zero as shown in fig.4 . in the fig.4 the @xmath2-function for the ordinary qed",
    "is compared with the ncqed ( with and without neutrino ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the nc qed @xmath2-function is equal to the usual qed for @xmath4 .",
    "we have considered the unexpanded ncqed based on the @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath2 function in agreement with @xcite does not depend on the parameter of non commutativity but in contrast with the @xmath72 ncqed it depends on a new parameter i.e. mixing parameter @xmath3 , see ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 function can be negative , positive or zero depending on the value of the mixing parameter .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath2 function in the @xmath72 ncqed is suffering from the asymptotic freedom that is in contrast with the experiment .",
    "we have compared our result with the ordinary qed in the fig.4 and it is found that for the @xmath4 our @xmath2 function is equal to the ordinary qed .",
    "in fact we have shown that in contrast with the expanded qed the unexpanded ncqed based on the @xmath1 gauge group is not only one - loop renormalizable but also by fixing @xmath3 it can have the same value for the @xmath2 function as the commutative qed . nevertheless the obtained value for @xmath3 needs to confirm in an independent way .",
    "* electron self energy : * the electron self - energy includes two diagrams as are shown in the fig.[fig_1 ] . using the feynman rules ( [ e - p ] ) and ( [ e - g0 ] ) one can write    @xmath74    where @xmath75",
    ". then one has @xmath76 * photon self energy : * all diagrams corresponding to the one loop photon self energy are shown in the fig.2 .",
    "first we calculate the fermion loop , fig.2a , containing electron , @xmath77 and @xmath78 quarks as follows    @xmath79    where the coefficient @xmath80 is a color factor for the quarks @xmath77 and @xmath78 . using the feynman rules ( [ e - p ] ) , ( [ d - p ] ) and ( [ u - p ] ) one can easily find @xmath81 where @xmath82 means non - planer .",
    "in fact the non - planer part has not any contribution to the beta function @xcite and it is not needed to calculate this part . meanwhile the planer parts are similar to the ordinary qed and it can be easily obtained as @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , the impact of the neutrino loop on the photon self energy , using ( [ n - p ] ) , can be easily obtained as follows @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "therefore the total contribution of the fermion loops can be obtained as @xmath87 now we consider the contribution of the gauge bosons on the self - energy of photon , fig.2b and fig.2c .",

    "then after performing the integral on the momenta we have @xmath91 the contribution of the diagrams given in the fig.2c on the photon self energy can be easily obtained in a similar way as follows @xmath92-d(k+2q)^\\mu(k+2q)^\\nu + [ ( 2k+q)^\\mu(k+2q)^\\nu\\nonumber\\\\    & & +    ( k - q)^\\mu(2k+q)^\\nu-(k+2q)^\\mu(k - q)^\\nu+(\\mu\\leftrightarrow\\nu)]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and after performing the integral on the momentum the self energy leads to @xmath94+\\gamma(2-d/2)g^{\\mu\\nu}q^2(1/2)[3 - 2x+2x^2]\\nonumber\\\\     & & -\\gamma(2-d/2)q^\\mu q^\\nu(1/2)[(2-d)(1 - 2x)^2 + 2(1+x)(2-x)]].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , one should note that for the two photons ( using ( [ 3p ] ) ) , two @xmath95 ( using ( [ p-2g0 ] ) ) and two gluons ( [ p-2 g ] ) in the loop the symmetry factor is @xmath90 but for the photon-@xmath95 ( using ( [ g0 - 2p ] ) ) in the loop the factor is one .",
