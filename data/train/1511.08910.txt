    "self - similarity of random walks is expressed in the fact that the space - time evolution of the transport on a uniform background from an instant point source ( i.e.  green function ) is a function of a single variable . in the case of normal ( or ordinary ) diffusion , defined as the brownian motion described by the differential equation of the fokker - planck type ,",
    "the green function is a gaussian which argument determines the scaling law for the propagation front , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient .    in a broader frame , beyond the brownian motion ,",
    "the diversity of the free - path lengths ( step lengths ) provided by the long - tailed , power - law probability distribution function ( pdf ) leads to a superdiffusive transport ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the dominant contribution to the transport comes from the long - free - path carriers ( named , by p. mandelbrot @xcite , lvy flights , cf .",
    "page ix in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in various physics problems ,",
    "superdiffusion was qualified / named as a non - local transport which is described by an integral , in space variables , equation which is non - reducible to a differential one .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for the biberman - holstein equation @xcite which is derived from a couple of differential kinetic equation for photons and atoms , or ions , and describes the space - time evolution of the density of excited atoms / ions produced by the radiative transfer in the spectral lines in gases and plasmas .",
    "the biberman - holstein equation assumes complete redistribution over frequency ( within spectral line width ) in the elementary act of the resonance scattering ( i.e.  absorption and subsequent emission ) of the photon by an atom / ion .",
    "it is the loss of memory by the photon during its trapping by the atom / ion that makes the process a markovian one .",
    "the respective value of @xmath1 in the differential equation , derived by a proper expansion / simplification of the integral equation , explicitly depends on the size , @xmath2 , of a finite medium and tends to infinity with @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter makes the very concept of diffusivity irrelevant to such a mechanism of transport ( however , the term diffusion is sometimes applied to such phenomena ) .",
    "the respective mean squared displacement in an infinite medium also diverges so that the propagation front should be defined in a way relevant to superdiffusion @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the role of long - free - path photons , i.e.  those emitted in the far wings of the spectral line shape , has been recognized @xcite and was the basis of the escape probability ( ep ) approaches @xcite .",
    "we can also mention an extension of the biberman - holstein approach from the line to continuous spectra : the ep method for non - stationary heat transport by the longitudinal ( electron bernstein ) waves in plasmas @xcite , which extended the integral equation approach to the similar steady - state transport @xcite , and the ep approach to the transport by plasma waves @xcite , which extended / modified the approach to the transport by electron cyclotron waves in nuclear fusion plasmas @xcite . despite the term `` lvy flights '' was not used in refs .  from @xcite to @xcite ,",
    "the dominant mechanism of the transport considered in these papers actually gets to this category .    alternatively to the biberman - holstein equation widely used in the laboratory plasmas , in astrophysics the above - mentioned couple of differential kinetic equations for photons and atoms / ions is often reduced to an integral , in space variables , equation for the radiation intensity ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "the role of lvy flights is identified , as a rule without naming , as well .",
    "now situation in the literature appears to be ambiguous . on the one hand , in the article `` a lvy flight for light '' @xcite it was claimed that ``   to date ,",
    "it has not seemed possible to observe and study lvy transport in actual materials .",
    "for example , experimental work on heat , sound , and light diffusion is generally limited to normal , brownian , diffusion . '' on the other hand , the role of lvy flight for light in the conventional frames of radiative transfer in spectral lines is identified , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the recent decades , the original version of superdiffusion in the formalism of fractional order derivatives went far beyond the pure mathematics and now is widely used in many applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this formalism the scaling laws ( i.e.  self - similarity of solutions ) are derived much easier than in the case of integral equations , however derivation of an exact solution is often as difficult as in the integral equation formalisms .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate a method for derivation of automodel solutions for a wide class of non - stationary superdiffusive transport on a uniform background in the frame of integral equation formalism .",
    "the method allows derivation of the solution in the form which relies on the scaling law for the propagation front , defined as a relevant - to - superdiffusion average displacement .",
    "the algorithm of constructing such a solution uses also the asymptotic behavior of the green function far beyond and far in advance of the propagation front .",
    "all the building blocks of the model are shown to be determined by the long - free - path carriers in the power - law tail of the pdf ( i.e. , by lvy flights ) .",
    "the validity of the suggested automodel solution is proved by its comparison with numerical solutions of transport equations .",
    "first , the main principles of the method are presented for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) transport with a simple long - tailed pdf ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "a test of the proposed automodel solution is carried out via comparison with direct numerical solution for various power - law exponents ( sec .",
    "a 3d transport is addressed in the case of the biberman - holstein equation with various spectral line shapes ( sec .",
    "a test of the general automodel solution is made via comparison with analytic solutions by veklenko @xcite for the green function for the doppler and lorenz spectral line shapes , and with similar solutions for the voight and holtsmark spectral line shapes .",
    "we consider the 1d transport on a uniform background , described by the equation for spatial density @xmath4 of an excitation of the background medium , which may evolve due to the exchange of excitation between various points of the medium via emission and absorption of the carriers ( here the retardation caused by the finite velocity of carriers is neglected ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a step - length pdf ( i.e.  the probability that the carrier , emitted at some point , is absorbed at a distance @xmath7 from that point ) , @xmath8 is the absolute value of the emission rate , @xmath9 is the source function , which is the rate of production of excitation by an external source ( i.e.  a source which differs from the excitation of the medium due to absorption described by the @xmath10 function ) , and @xmath11 is the rate of quenching of excitation .",
    "the uniformity of background assumes that , first , the @xmath10 is a function of only one variable , the distance between the points of emission and absorption , and , second , @xmath12 and @xmath11 are the constants .",
    "the latter makes the role of quenching simply described by the time exponent @xmath13 , therefore in what follows we omit this process .",
    "hereafter we use dimensionless time and space coordinate , assuming the normalization of time by @xmath12 and using a dimensionless pdf .",
    "we will seek for the green function , taking , respectively , the source function as a point instant source , @xmath14 we take the pdf in the following simple form which possesses a long - tail and the infinite value of the mean square displacement : @xmath15 it is worth to introduce the probability , @xmath16 , for the carrier to pass , without any absorption , the distance not exceeding a certain value , @xmath17 .",

    "these methods have been anticipated by the approximate solution @xcite , obtained for steady - state problem by taking @xmath24 out of the integral term , and by the analysis @xcite of validity of solution @xcite .",

    "the distant points see almost a point source of carriers because the diffusion of the excitation around the origin @xmath27 may be neglected . the exchange of the neighboring distant points may also be neglected .",
