    "<S> the level of social influence in a community follows from the statistics of responses ( `` like '' and `` dislike '' votes ) to the comments written by the members of the same community . </S>",
    "<S> three real cases of developing news stories are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that internet comments may predict the level of social response similar to a barometer that predicts the intensity of a coming storm in still calm environment .    in recent years , governments throughout the arab world have been overthrown by uprisings that followed the self - immolation of a single person , mohamed bouazizi . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the occupy wall street protest movement was triggered by a single call to action via a social network . </S>",
    "<S> such cases raise an important question : how can an individual possessing no special reputation or authority mobilize an entire community by a single call to stand and fight , while large and professionally organized companies may remain unnoticed ? answering this question will help estimating the appropriate timing and the required size for an initial group to evoke a large - scale social response .    </S>",
    "<S> a clear and strong display of personal opinions affects the decision - making processes of others . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon of social influence may be either positive or negative . </S>",
    "<S> positive social influence facilitates the correlated behavior called herding@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> herding contributes significantly to the formation of market prices@xcite@xcite , the results of artificial market experiments@xcite@xcite@xcite , traffic flows@xcite , voting outcomes@xcite@xcite , and dynamics of social networks@xcite@xcite@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> acute herding phenomena , such as social revolutions or financial crises , are extremely difficult to predict , though they are evident when they occur@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a parameter , such as temperature in phase transitions , is required to estimate the stability of a community s opinion , i.e. the potential of a small perturbation to culminate in abrupt changes in opinion dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to understand the population dynamics prior to a possible transition , it is important to develop a quantitative analysis of herding as a function of time .    </S>",
    "<S> internet communities are of special interest for the analysis of the herding phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> individual opinions are widely exposed in binary form of `` like '' and `` dislike '' votes ( `` likes '' and `` dislikes '' ) over internet news websites and via social networks . </S>",
    "<S> the data span any important event and expose millions of opinions@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . simultaneous analysis of a developing news story and the corresponding herding in relevant internet communities may provide a unique opportunity to study the opinion dynamics in a population as it approaches a critical point and becomes unstable . to the best of our knowledge , the definition and evaluation of the temporal dynamics of herding phenomenon in internet communities remains a challenge .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the social influence as a function of time in internet communities that followed any of the following three news stories reported on the cnn website : the zimmerman trial , iran nuclear negotiations , and the us government shutdown of 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> we show continuous herding dynamics in all three cases and significant amplification of social influence near the verdict announcement in the zimmerman case . </S>",
    "<S> the method we propose allows for the quantitative estimation of a community response to the injection of a group of non - responsive individuals with predefined opinion . </S>",
    "<S> this quantitative analysis is possible due to our novel approach to herding as the conditional probabilities to agree or disagree with other people s opinions . </S>",
    "<S> this approach differs from the generally accepted treatment of herding as a topology of social interactions network@xcite .    to estimate social susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> , we use a specific type of internet news discussion . some internet news websites provide a commentary section where readers can comment and vote ( i.e. , like or dislike ) other readers comments ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cnn_analysis_diagram ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a reader can usually vote for any number of comments , with the restriction of one vote per comment . </S>",
    "<S> these data constitute a natural large scale social experiment where the population responds to some external signal ( i.e. , a comment ) . a comment </S>",
    "<S> , however , is not completely external , but rather created by a community member who responds to the comments of other community members . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , statistics of internet comments and responses can be used as a measure for mean field opinion dynamics of the corresponding community .    consider a large population of @xmath0 individuals who are debating on a subject @xmath1 and continuously voting in favor of @xmath1 ( up @xmath2 ) or against it ( down @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the debate process implies that individuals may change their vote in time . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between individual @xmath4 and any other randomly selected individual @xmath5 is expressed by the fact that the probability per contact of individual @xmath4 to vote down ( @xmath6 ) depends on the vote of individual @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this conditional probability is given by @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vote of individual @xmath5 ( @xmath9 for up vote and @xmath10 for down vote ) and parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the probability per contact of individual @xmath4 voting down given individual @xmath5 is voting up ( down ) , respectively , regardless of the vote of individual @xmath4 prior to the interaction with individual @xmath5 .    in a well mixed homogeneous population , where the number of contacts per individual is @xmath13 and @xmath14 , </S>",

    "<S> @xmath27 where @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the population response function @xmath26 is zero for @xmath29 and for @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> the herding parameter @xmath31 $ ] is a measure of the social influence of one individual on others , because @xmath28 is the difference of conditional probabilities for correlated and anti - correlated behaviors , see [ eq : conditional probability 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar to herding or percolation parameter @xmath32 from  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since our definition of the herding parameter @xmath33 accounts for both positive and negative social influence , it is better suited for analyzing opinion dynamics in binary vote communities .    </S>",
    "<S> the social susceptibility @xmath34 , is defined as @xmath35 and is the average size of a group whose members follow the change of opinion of a single member ( not including the initiating member itself ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the perturbation group @xmath36 required to convert a population @xmath37 to the mean vote of the perturbed group @xmath38 ( including the polarized cases @xmath39 ) is obtained by substituting @xmath40 in eq .   and using eq .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 where @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> conditional probabilities @xmath37 define herding @xmath33 , which in turn defines the social stability of the community . to calculate conditional probabilities @xmath43 and @xmath44 as a function of likes @xmath45 and dislikes @xmath46 votes for comment @xmath4 of article @xmath47 ( see fig .  [ fig : cnn_analysis_diagram ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that voters and commentators populations are equivalent and that the number of comments and votes is large enough to apply mean field assumption . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the probabilities for a commentator and a voter to be in favor of the article subject @xmath1 are both equal to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the comments should consist of two groups with opposite opinions and relative sizes @xmath19 and @xmath48 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> according to the definition of the conditional probabilities ( eq .  [ eq : conditional probability 1 ] ) , the ratio between likes and all responses ( likes and dislikes ) for a positive comment ( to @xmath1 ) is @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this ratio for a negative comment ( to @xmath1 ) equals @xmath44 since expressing a like vote for a negative comment is equivalent to expressing a dislike vote for the article subject @xmath1 commented upon . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the probability of a dislike vote for a comment @xmath50 is different from the probability @xmath51 to dislike subject @xmath1 , as defined in ( eq .  [ eq : pdown ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the probability of a dislike vote for a comment is : @xmath52 the result is invariant under the transformation @xmath53 , reflecting the uncertainty regarding the opinion of the internet article itself . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the division of the comments into two groups with contrasting opinions does not reveal the opinions themselves . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath34 is invariant under the transformation @xmath53 , we arbitrarily chose @xmath54 . an interesting consequence of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is that @xmath55 , i.e. comments can not include only dislikes because the community can not dislike its own opinion .    </S>",
    "<S> calculating of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath19 of the community proceeds through iterations . </S>",
    "<S> first , all comments are sorted by their like vote fraction . </S>",
    "<S> then , at each step @xmath56 , the comments are divided into two groups with ratio of @xmath57 and @xmath58 according to their like vote fraction , where group @xmath59 receives the @xmath57 comments with the highest like vote fraction and group @xmath60 receives all other comments . </S>",
    "<S> the population characteristic parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are then calculated according to : @xmath63 a new population mean vote @xmath64 is calculated using the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 : @xmath65 the process is repeated until the convergence of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> .the results of social susceptibility calculation for 12 cnn articles from different dates that cover three different events . for each article , the values of conditional probabilities @xmath37 and social susceptibility @xmath34 were calculated . [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : cnn ]    the formalism of the analysis of the social influence presented above is applied to news articles published on the cnn website that discuss three different topics . </S>",
    "<S> the first story includes six articles , published between june 24th and july 25th , 2013 , covering the george zimmerman trial  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these articles cover the legal proceeding , the verdict , and the post - verdict jurors opinions about the trial . </S>",
    "<S> the second story includes three articles , published between october 25th and november 25th , 2013 , covering the negotiations and signing of the geneva interim agreement on the iranian nuclear program  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the third story includes three articles , published on october 1st and 2nd , 2013 , covering the us federal government shutdown of that year  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these articles cover the first day of the shutdown and the white house failing efforts to end it . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these analyses are presented in table  [ table : cnn ] and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cnn_analysis ] .    </S>",
    "<S> all three cases exhibit a continuous dynamics in @xmath37 space , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cnn_analysis ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result is interesting considering that the analysis is applied to different articles , covering different stories , spanning from days to months . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates a slow change of opinions in the community .    in the iran nuclear program and us government shutdown cases , the population s characteristic parameters @xmath37 are constant , although they correspond to different cnn articles and , in the case of the iran nuclear program , span one month . </S>",
    "<S> this result may also indicate the absence of special events during the observation period .    </S>",
    "<S> the social susceptibility level in the zimmerman trial case changes near the verdict announcement . in the period </S>",
    "<S> prior to the verdict day ( points 1 - 3 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cnn_analysis ] ) , the level of social susceptibility in the population remains almost constant and similar to the social susceptibility in the other cases ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , despite the changes in @xmath43 and @xmath44 . from the verdict day on ( points 4 - 6 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the social susceptibility in the community grows rapidly and the population approaches the singular point @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> it is out of the scope of this work to interpret social phenomena , though the results demonstrate that our method allows to observe the otherwise hidden herding level in a community together with its response to social triggers </S>",
    "<S> .    the limitations of our work include the absence of external force , i.e. government control , and lack of interaction topology constrains , such as the prevalence of near - neighbors interactions . </S>",
    "<S> omitting topological constraints seems to be justified in internet communities . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true regarding forces that shape opinion or add weight to some opinion , such as government control or mass media . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the internet is still a free zone . </S>",
    "<S> the model can be extended to include such force , though there is no clear way to quantify it . shortly after the data collection phase for this work </S>",
    "<S> was completed , the cnn website has changed its comments policy and the dislike count per comment is no longer displayed . </S>",
    "<S> this change made the cnn website articles and comments unsuitable for the above comment analysis procedure , since the main assumption underlying our model , i.e. , that both like and dislike vote counts are available to all individuals in the population , is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> this study demonstrates the potential of _ both _ like / dislike votes in estimating the social state of a community and may contribute to the evolving formation of the internet news format .    to conclude , the developed tools for social influence in internet communities reveal the previously hidden level of herding and social influence as a function of time in populations . in addition , this work provides a measure for the stability of public opinion in a community and for the size of a group capable to cause critical change in average opinion . </S>",
    "<S> the presented method can be compared with other methods and can be extended to other fields such as financial markets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this work enables an intriguing comparison of the herding in the same community calculated from different sources , such as internet news and financial markets .    </S>",
