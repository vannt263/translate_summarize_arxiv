    "he also showed that some of these bundles are not diffeomorphic to @xmath5 , he thereby exhibited the first examples of exotic spheres . shortly thereafter , in 1962 , eells and kuiper @xcite classified all such bundles with euler class @xmath4 up to diffeomorphism and showed that @xmath6 of the @xmath7 seven dimensional exotic spheres can be described as @xmath0-bundles over @xmath1 .    in 1974 gromoll and meyer @xcite constructed a metric with non - negative sectional curvature on one of these sphere bundles , exhibiting the first example of an exotic sphere with non - negative curvature . very recently grove and ziller @xcite showed that the total space of every @xmath0-bundle over @xmath1 admits a metric with non - negative sectional curvature",
    ". motivated by these examples they asked for a classification of these manifolds up to homotopy equivalence , homeomorphism and diffeomorphism ( see problem 5.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "although a partial classification of this type is contained in @xcite and @xcite , it seems that this has not been carried out in the literature in complete generality .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to do this .    in the following description we use the notation of tamura @xcite .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the fibre bundles over the @xmath3-sphere @xmath9 with total space @xmath10 , fibre the @xmath2-sphere @xmath11 and structure group @xmath12 .",
    "equivalence classes of such bundles are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath13 .",
    "more precisely , the generators @xmath14 and @xmath15 of @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the quaternions with norm 1 , i.e. we have have identified @xmath11 with the unit quaternions . with this choice of generators each pair of integers @xmath20 gives the element @xmath21 and thus determines the bundle @xmath22    the definition we use is different from the one given by milnor in @xcite .",
    "he uses two integers @xmath23 corresponding to a different choice of generators of @xmath24 .",
    "the two pairs @xmath20 and @xmath23 are related by @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the first level of classification of the manifolds @xmath27 is up to homotopy equivalence . in a remarkable paper @xcite james and whitehead succeeded in classifying the manifolds @xmath27 up to homotopy except for the case @xmath28 .",
    "we complete this last case by means of standard tools of homotopy theory which were not available in early 1950s when james and whitehead wrote their article .",
    "[ hom ] the manifolds @xmath27 and @xmath29 are homotopy equivalent if and only if @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that since @xmath32 , necessarily @xmath33 if @xmath27 and @xmath34 are homotopy equivalent .",
    "the next level , the homeomorphism classification , was studied by tamura @xcite , who gave sufficient conditions for two manifolds @xmath27 and @xmath35 to be homeomorphic .",
    "we use basic results in surgery theory to show that , in fact , tamura s conditions are necessary as well .",

    "the homeomorphism classification is exactly the same as the @xmath39-classification for the manifolds @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , we take advantage of this fact in the proof of theorem [ top ] .    the diffeomorphism classification of the manifolds @xmath27 is related to the famous article by milnor @xcite , where he proved that the manifolds @xmath40 are exotic homotopy spheres .",

    "in addition , we require @xmath46 to satisfy the _ @xmath41-condition _",
    ", see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41-condition allows the pull - back of the pontrjagin classes of @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",

    "the most important feature of the @xmath41-invariant is that it is an invariant of the diffeomorphism type of @xmath10 .",

    "a natural question to ask is which manifolds homotopy equivalent to @xmath27 may be represented by manifolds @xmath51 . in a corollary to theorem [ diff ]",

    "first we recall some basic facts from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath54 be a sphere bundle with fibre @xmath0 .",
    "then there is an exact sequence of homotopy groups : @xmath55 in particular , we have to understand the homomorphism @xmath56 in order to compute the various homology , cohomology and homotopy groups of @xmath57 . in the case of @xmath58 we know that @xmath59 , and by the hurewicz theorem @xmath60 .",
    "hence the homomorphism @xmath61 is multiplication by @xmath62 .",

    "here we have that @xmath67 .",
    "thus , as pointed out in @xcite , the manifolds @xmath53 have a _ preferred _ orientation which is defined naturally by the standard orientations of the base and fiber spheres .",
    "however , the manifolds @xmath53 still may have ( and indeed have ) a self - homotopy map @xmath68 of degree @xmath69 .",
    "james & whitehead @xcite give the following definitions .",

    "a manifold @xmath53 is called _ self - opposed _ if there exists a self - homotopy equivalence @xmath68 of degree @xmath69 . as it is emphasized in @xcite ,",
    "there is no ambiguity here if @xmath72 or @xmath73 since then every homotopy equivalence @xmath74 must be of degree @xmath75 and this fact is used in @xcite to obtain the homotopy equivalence classification for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "hence in order to complete the classification for @xmath52 we need to show that up to homotopy every homotopy equivalence @xmath76 must be of degree @xmath75 .",
    "we prove this fact by showing that every manifold @xmath53 is self - opposed .    given a manifold @xmath77 we construct a self - homotopy map @xmath68 of degree @xmath69 by considering @xmath78 as a @xmath79-complex . the cell - structure is described in @xcite .",

    "namely , _ if @xmath103=0 $ ] in the group @xmath104 and @xmath105 is infinite cyclic , then the manifolds @xmath53 are self - opposed .",
    "_ this condition may be a source for confusion because the group @xmath105 is not infinite cyclic , but rather @xmath106 , see @xcite .",
