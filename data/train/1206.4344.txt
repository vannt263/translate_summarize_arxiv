    "the contemplation of the moon during a lunar eclipse reveals the dimming , and subsequent brightening , of the lunar disk as the satellite enters , and then exits , the shadow cast by the sun - illuminated earth .",

    "the experiment is relevant to the investigation of the terrestrial atmosphere because , for a known position of the moon within the earth s shadow , the lightcurves are interpretable in terms of the optical properties of the atmosphere @xcite . beyond traditional photometric measurements ,",
    "two spectroscopic observations of the august 2008 lunar eclipse have demonstrated the richness of the spectrum of sunlight reflected from the eclipsed moon and shown that it contains the signature of the principal atmospheric constituents @xcite .    within the sample of known extrasolar planets , the transiting ones form a subgroup particularly apt for characterization .",
    "during transit , the planet partially blocks the disk of its host star , causing a drop in the amount of stellar light that arrives to the observer .",
    "the apparent stellar dimming is related to the sizes of the core and when there is one the gaseous envelope of the planet .",
    "the technique of in - transit transmission spectroscopy , which relies on comparing the apparent stellar dimming at selected wavelengths , has led to the detection of atoms and molecules such as na , h , c , o , co , co@xmath1 , h@xmath1o and ch@xmath2 in the atmospheres of a few giant close - in extrasolar planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "lunar eclipses and exoplanetary transits are related phenomena . in both instances a fraction of the light collected by the observer is stellar light that has passed through a section of the planet s limb and , thus , carries the signature of the planet s gaseous envelope .",
    "the photon trajectories , whether direct or deflected in scattering collisions with the atmospheric constituents , determine the signature imprinted on the collected stellar light . throughout the text",
    ", we use the term ( lunar ) eclipse to refer to the alignment of the sun , earth and moon , and transit to refer to the earth s passage in front of the sun as observed from a remote vantage point .    the classical theory of lunar eclipses",

    "the omission is likely due to the minor contribution of refraction to the lightcurves of the close - in giant planets that constitute most of the extrasolar planets discovered to date .",

    "our main goal is to clarify the similarities and dissimilarities in the signal collected by terrestrial observers in both types of event , emphasizing the impact of refraction .",
    "the paper is structured in two main blocks . in the first block ,  [ theory_sec][timevar_sec ] , we introduce the lunar eclipse theory and investigate a set of previously unpublished near - infrared spectra of the august 2008 lunar eclipse . in the second block ,  [ transit_sec ] , we take the lunar eclipse theory to the limit of a remotely distant observer and address the comparison between lunar eclipses and transits . in  [ timevar_sec][transit_sec ]",
    ", we also discuss the conclusions drawn by some prior works in relation with the theory of lunar eclipses and exoplanetary transits .",
    "finally ,  [ summary_sec ] summarizes the main conclusions . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work that investigates the effect of refraction on the in - transit spectral signature of earth - like extrasolar planets .",
    "the spectra investigated in  [ timevar_sec ] were obtained on 16 august 2008 with the liris spectrograph at the william herschel telescope , wht @xcite , located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) , la palma , spain .",
    "the observations were made alternating over two wavelength ranges with two different grisms : @xmath3 , from 0.9 to 1.5 @xmath4 m , and @xmath5 , from 1.4 to 2.4 @xmath4 m .",
    "a total of 11 spectra of the moon in umbra were collected , 6 in @xmath3 and 5 in @xmath5 .",
    "the umbra observations ran from 20:54 until 22:16ut and probed different phases of the earth s inner shadow projected on the lunar disk .",
    "the data reduction and telluric correction follow @xcite and will not be discussed further .",
    "the fits raw datafiles are publicly available from the ing archive . for their published spectrum from 1 to 2.4 @xmath4 m , @xcite merged the three spectra closest to greatest eclipse in each wavelength range . we will now focus on the individual umbra spectra in order to investigate their evolution over time and distance from greatest eclipse .",
    "for the interpretation of the observations , we produced model simulations of the eclipse spectrum .",
    "the simulations involved solving the radiative transport problem of sunlight in the earth s atmosphere according to the formulation laid out by @xcite .",
    "the formulation assumes that the observer is located on the moon s surface , which allows us to ignore the reflection of sunlight at the moon and the atmospheric extinction above the earth - bound observer .",
    "generally , we integrate the direct and scattered components of radiance at the lunar observer s site over a solid angle @xmath6 that includes both the solar and planetary disks . denoting by @xmath7 the radiance at the observer s site @xmath8 in the incident direction @xmath9",
    ", the irradiance or flux of sunlight into an elementary surface oriented according to @xmath10 is obtained from : @xmath11    for the direct component , beer - lambert s law is integrated on the refraction - bent trajectories of all possible lines of sight connecting the lunar observer s site with the solar disk . at the solar disk ,",
    "the sun s emission radiance is scaled according to a specified limb - darkening function . for the scattered component",
    ", the solar photon trajectories are simulated by a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "the formulation is general enough to investigate both the umbra and penumbra phases of a lunar eclipse and , as discussed below , to predict the in - transit signature of extrasolar planets .",
    "figure ( [ sketch0_fig ] ) sketches how the refraction - bent rays are traced sunwards from the observer s site and , in turn , how eq .",
    "( [ irradianceo_eq ] ) is evaluated for the direct sunlight component . in our numerical implementation of the integral",
    ", one ray is traced for each specified discrete element of @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "( we throughout refer to rays , although it would be more appropriate to refer to ray bundles . ) since the integration is carried out at @xmath8 , we do not have to correct for the optical phenomenon of attenuation by refraction @xcite .",
    "attenuation by refraction is simply the reduction in the cross section ( and therefore in the associated irradiance ) of a ray bundle departing from the solar disk and reaching the observer s site after crossing the earth s atmosphere . in other formulations that use the solar plane for integrating eq .",
    "( [ irradianceo_eq ] ) , this phenomenon must be explicitly introduced as a factor weighing the size of the emitting solar disk parcel and its refracted image at the planet s terminator @xcite .",
    "this effect would be especially important for rays crossing the lower layers of the atmosphere .",
    "those are also the rays more strongly affected by gas and aerosol extinction .",
    "the formulation holds valid for any combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath14 is the geocentric angular distance from the area of lunar disk being probed to the geometrical umbra centre and @xmath15 is the distance from the observer s site on the moon to the earth s centre . in the @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 limit ,",
    "the formulation becomes relevant to the investigation of transiting extrasolar planets and @xmath14 becomes a measure of the orbital phase .",
    "numerically , we set @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 by assuming a sufficiently large @xmath15 .",
    "special care is taken to ensure that all the formula occurring in the numerical implementation adopt the correct forms in that limit case .",
    "we start by investigating the near - infrared spectra obtained at the wht , looking for changes in their structure during the umbra phase of the eclipse .",
    "the exercise is useful to further validate our model of lunar eclipses and to show how the depth of molecular bands in the spectra varies as the eclipse progresses .",

    "for the o@xmath1@xmath22o@xmath1 cia band at 1.06 @xmath4 m , we adopted the binary cross sections measured at 230 k in a 75/25% mixture of o@xmath1/n@xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "for the o@xmath1@xmath22o@xmath1 + o@xmath1@xmath22n@xmath1 cia band at 1.27 @xmath4 m , we used the binary cross sections measured at 253 k by @xcite .",

    "the selected band shapes and scaling factors are consistent with the conclusions drawn in a recent investigation of solar occultation data obtained with the sciamachy spectrometer aboard envisat @xcite .",
    "we evaluated the optical opacity for both cia bands through @xmath27[\\mbox{x}]ds$ ] , where @xmath28 is the differential integration path , [ @xmath22 ] stands for number density , x is the o@xmath1 collision partner in the cia band ( o@xmath1 at 1.06 @xmath4 m and o@xmath1 + n@xmath1 at 1.27 @xmath4 m ) and @xmath30 are the binary cross sections .",
    "we set an opaque cloud layer with cloud tops at 6 km and an aerosol extinction profile at 1.02 @xmath4 m about 4 times the september 2008 profile of @xcite .",
    "further , we assumed that the aerosol optical properties are wavelength - independent over the explored range of wavelengths .",
    "the nominal atmosphere is consistent with the findings by @xcite from optical data of the same eclipse that point to a heavy aerosol loading following the eruption of the kasatochi volcano one week ahead of the eclipse .",
    "scattered sunlight is negligible longwards of 1 @xmath4 m and therefore omitted .",
    "the simulated spectra were convolved with a gaussian line shape at a resolving power of about 1,000 .",
    "a critical aspect in the comparison between observations and simulations is the solar elevation angle , @xmath14 , or distance from the geometrical umbra centre to the projection of the instrument s collecting element on the lunar disk .",
    "no images were taken of the slit projected on the moon and @xmath14 had to be estimated indirectly .",
    "for that purpose , we followed two different methods .",
    "method 1 ) estimates @xmath14 from the telescope pointing coordinates recorded in the fits raw datafiles .",
    "the sun , earth and moon coordinates , the coordinates at the orm and the angular size of the lunar disk were taken from the jpl horizons service @xcite . in method 2 ) , we produced geocentric images of the lunar disk with the geoviz software . from the moon s centre , we displaced the slit south in equatorial declination on the image until only half of the 4.2-arcmin slit rested on the lunar disk . from the image , we recorded the coordinates of the mid - point projection of the slit on the lunar disk",
    ". then , @xmath14 was calculated as the geocentric angle from that point to the umbra centre .",
    "figure ( [ timevar_fig ] ) shows the set of 11 umbra spectra together with our model simulations .",
    "we arranged the @xmath3 and @xmath5 spectra in pairs according to the times of observation .",
    "each pair contains data collected within an interval of no more than 6 minutes . to first approximation ,",
    "each pair can be seen as an uninterrupted spectrum from 0.9 to 2.4 @xmath4 m . for the model simulations",
    ", we adjusted the @xmath14 parameter to ensure an optimal match of the eclipse data . in some cases we modified the h@xmath1o content by an amount that was always less than 10% of the nominal profile .",
    "the text in the graphs gives the time at mid - exposure and airmass for the moon - to - telescope optical path , along with the estimated ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and adjusted ( @xmath33 ) solar elevation angles .",
    "the quality of each match was judged by giving special weight to the o@xmath1 and cia bands in @xmath3 , and the co@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 bands in @xmath5 .",
    "absorption in both cia bands remains linear throughout the eclipse .",
    "indeed , we note the suitability of the cia band at 1.06 @xmath4 m , which occurs over a region only moderately affected by other molecular bands , for monitoring the moon s progress across the umbra .",
    "overall , the agreement between the eclipse data and the simulations is consistently good over the entire spectral range .",
    "exceptions are the regions of strong water absorption at 1.351.45 and 1.82.1 @xmath4 m , where the telluric correction introduces obvious artifacts .",
    "a more flexible implementation of aerosol extinction in the simulations would have surely improved the match between the observational and synthetic spectra , but it was judged that such an effort was not critical for the present purpose .    the minimum @xmath33 occurs at 21:1221:16 ut , in fair agreement with the prediction of geometrical greatest eclipse for 21:10:06ut . the comparison between the estimated and adjusted angles indicates that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are systematically larger than @xmath33 .",
    "the differences are typically @xmath00.05@xmath34 except in the 20:5420:59 ut spectrum , in which case it reaches @xmath00.1@xmath34 .",
    "this spectrum was acquired at a rather high airmass , and refraction in the moon - to - telescope optical path may thus play a role .",
    "the 4.2arcmin slit spans @xmath01/15-th of the lunar disk diameter .",
    "the sunlight that enters the slit arrives from a range of distances to the umbra centre that may lead to differences in @xmath14 of @xmath00.04@xmath34 .",
    "further , the non - uniform albedo of the moon along the slit may move the effective slit centre away from its geometrical location .",
    "it is thus difficult to define an equivalent solar elevation angle from purely geometrical considerations .",
    "in addition to the above arguments , one may also expect that local features in the atmosphere intercepted by the refracted sunlight rays will have an impact on @xmath33 . to explore this possibility",
    ", we conducted a few simulations in modified conditions of clouds and aerosols .",
    "as a rule , setting the cloud tops below the nominal 6km level leads to deeper absorption bands than in nominal conditions . if , for instance , the cloud tops are set at 3 km , the 21:1221:16ut eclipse spectra are optimally reproduced with @xmath14@xmath00.29@xmath34 , rather than 0.27@xmath34 .",
    "the effect of low clouds on @xmath33 diminishes progressively as @xmath14 increases .",
    "the nominal aerosol profile extends well up to @xmath01617 km and results in sunlight extinction over a broad range of altitudes . we verified that reducing the aerosol extinction to the september 2008 levels of @xcite has a minor impact on the spectrum s structure near greatest eclipse .",

    "the sunlight rays that reach the area of lunar disk being probed have their closest approach to the earth s surface at altitudes in the range @xmath0211 km @xcite .",
    "the range is effectively narrower because the lower altitudes are optically thick and , in addition , we assumed opaque clouds below 6 km . the spectrum of fig .",
    "( [ timevar2_fig ] , top ) is indeed well approximated by a limb - viewing transmission spectrum of the atmosphere as seen from a tangent altitude of @xmath010 km .",
    "for comparison , fig .",
    "( [ timevar2_fig ] , bottom ) shows two solar occultation spectra measured with the sciamachy spectrometer for tangent altitudes of @xmath07.1 and 9.5 km .",
    "the resemblance of the lunar eclipse spectrum to the sciamachy spectra is apparent .    for @xmath14@xmath00.5@xmath34 ( still in the umbra )",
    ", the range of altitudes of closest approach is @xmath0416 km , and for @xmath14@xmath00.7@xmath34 ( at the umbra / penumbra edge ) it is @xmath0865 km . the shift and widening of the range of altitudes for closest approach has notable consequences on the spectrum s structure . for molecules",
    "whose densities decay monotonically with altitude , increasing @xmath14 means the dilution in the spectrum of the molecular signature .",
    "this is due , first , to a diminished contribution from the atmosphere s optically thicker layers and , second , to a larger amount of light passing unattenuated through the upper altitudes .",
    "this effect is especially apparent for h@xmath1o and the o@xmath1@xmath22o@xmath1 + o@xmath1@xmath22n@xmath1 collision complex because their densities drop at a faster rate than those of ( nearly ) well - mixed molecules such as o@xmath1 , co@xmath1 and ch@xmath2 .",
    "the simulations of the monomer and cia bands of oxygen at 1.27 @xmath4 m in fig .",
    "( [ timevar3_fig ] ) illustrate this trend . for @xmath14=0.3@xmath34 ,",
    "the o@xmath1:cia equivalent widths are in a ratio of 1:3.3 , whereas for @xmath14=0.7@xmath34 , the ratio is only 1:0.9 .",
    "thus , as the observer probes regions of the lunar disk closer to the penumbra , the relative contributions of h@xmath1o and the collision complex with respect to the other molecules tend to decrease .",
    "the umbra spectrum published by @xcite with data of the 16 august 2008 event is representative of conditions near greatest eclipse @xcite and the atmosphere at mid - to - north latitudes over the atlantic . at the relevant @xmath14@xmath00.3@xmath34 ,",
    "the absorption features are formed in refracted sunlight ray trajectories that approach the earth s surface at minimum distances @xmath3511 km .",
    "the occurrence of strong h@xmath1o and cia band features confirms the importance of the lower altitudes .",
    "@xcite mention the identification of the na neutral atom at optical wavelengths in their published spectrum .",
    "the eclipse was contemporary with the meteor shower of the perseids , which means that abnormally elevated amounts of that metal in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere might be expected @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate that in globally - averaged conditions the optical thickness at the resolution of the umbra spectrum for the na doublet at 0.589 @xmath4 m from a tangent altitude of 11 km is @xmath02@xmath1910@xmath36 .",
    "the sodium peak density is known to increase sporadically by factors of up to 10 in layers a few kilometer thick ( which entails an increase in the integrated column by a factor of a few ) , sometimes over horizontal spans of hundreds of kilometers , especially during meteor showers @xcite . even then",
    ", such a weak signature makes the detection of the na neutral atom challenging for a spectrum of moderate spectral resolution .",
    "thus , our analysis indicates that the identification of the na doublet in the @xcite spectrum is questionable and requires additional confirmation .",
    "everyday , sunsets offer real - life demonstrations of the refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere . looking from the ground over the horizon",
    ", the setting sun appears about one solar diameter above its true elevation .",
    "sunlight rays crossing the atmosphere and having their closest approach to the earth s surface at a tangent altitude @xmath37 are approximately refracted by an angle @xmath38@xmath0@xmath39@xmath40@xmath41@xmath19@xmath42 @xcite . for a terrestrial radius @xmath43@xmath06377 km ,",
    "a constant scale height @xmath44@xmath08 km and a typical refractivity at sea level in the optical @xmath45=@xmath46@xmath40@xmath47@xmath02.8@xmath1910@xmath20 , the end - to - end refracted angle estimated from the above equation is @xmath38@xmath01.14@xmath34 .",
    "thus , over a distance of 1 au , a ray incident on the planet that grazes the earth s surface is deflected by @xmath04.26 solar radii .",
    "tracing the ray trajectories from a remote observer s site back towards the solar disk , one concludes that the mid - transit solar image at the observer s site is formed by sunlight rays having their closest approach to the planet s surface at densities @xmath01/4.26 or less than at sea level .",
    "further , our estimate suggests that , at mid - transit , refraction prevents the remote observer s access to altitudes within a @xmath48-sized ring above the planet s surface .",
    "the exact size of this refraction - exclusion ring can only be determined by integrating the ray trajectories through the atmosphere after prescribing the altitude - dependent refractivity of the atmospheric gas .",
    "assuming , for the purpose of obtaining a first estimate , that the atmosphere is isothermal and that the refractivity decays with altitude as @xmath49 , one obtains that @xmath48@xmath0@xmath44@xmath50@xmath011.6 km .",

    "our model simulations with the formulation of  [ theory_sec ] in the @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 limit provide refined magnitudes of the above estimates for @xmath48 . for the nominal atmosphere described above",
    ", a sunlight ray grazing the earth s surface is refracted by @xmath01.08@xmath34 and only altitudes above @xmath48@xmath013.2 km contribute to the mid - transit signal measured at the observer s site .",
    "thus , the mid - transit spectrum measured by the remote observer will lack the signature of the atmospheric layers containing the bulk of the spectroscopically - active gases .",
    "the value of @xmath48 depends on the fluctuations in the atmosphere s density profile and water content through the refractivity of the gas . a sensitivity analysis perturbing those two parameters within the values in the model atmospheres of @xcite shows that @xmath48 typically lies between 12 and 14 km .",
    "figure ( [ transit_fig ] ) displays in black the mid - transit spectrum of the earth in two levels of approximation , namely with and without refraction , and three atmospheric scenarios .",
    "the scenarios represent : ( 1 ) a rayleigh atmosphere , free of clouds and aerosols ; ( 2 ) an atmosphere with cloud tops at 2 km , the background aerosol extinction profile for september 2007 at about 1 @xmath4 m published by @xcite multiplied by ( 1.02/@xmath54 [ @xmath4m])@xmath55 at other wavelengths ; and , ( 3 ) the aerosol - rich , cloudy atmosphere described in  [ timevar_sec ] .",
    "the aerosol loading in scenario ( 2 ) might be seen as a plausible representation of globally - averaged conditions @xcite .",
    "the aerosol loading in scenario ( 3 ) is abnormally elevated for typical earth conditions but may be representative of the atmosphere after a major volcanic eruption @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that in our own solar system , mars undergoes episodic events of abnormally elevated aerosol amounts being transported across the globe and thus affecting the aerosol loading on global scales , and that venus is enshrouded by a complex system of clouds and haze layers up to pressures well below 1 atm .",
    "we use the equivalent height , @xmath56 , defined according to : @xmath57 to provide a measure of the atmosphere s thickness opaque to the incident sunlight . as a consistency check",
    ", the refractionless calculations were tested against the more usual formulation for the in - transit stellar dimming @xcite : @xmath58 with : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the optical thickness at an impact altitude @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the optical extinction coefficient at altitude @xmath63 above the planet s surface .",
    "the agreement between the two implementations proved to be excellent .",
    "it must be mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ tau_eq ] ) was integrated in @xmath64 , = @xmath65 , rather than in @xmath66 , to avoid the singularity in the denominator of the integrand .",
    "figure ( [ transit_fig ] ) clearly shows how refraction removes much of the mid - transit spectrum s structure .",
    "an exception to that is the chappuis band of ozone , which absorbs noticeably in all cases shortwards of @xmath00.8 @xmath4 m .",
    "terrestrial ozone densities peak in the stratosphere , and ozone in the refraction - exclusion ring contributes in a minor way to the disk - integrated signature .",
    "the features longwards of 1 @xmath4 m are readily identifiable by comparison with fig .",
    "( [ timevar2_fig ] ) .",
    "shortwards of 1 @xmath4 m , the sharp features at 0.76 , 0.69 and 0.63 @xmath4 m are the @xmath67(@xmath68= 0)@xmath16@xmath69(@xmath70= 0 , 1 , 2 ) bands of o@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the remaining structure in that region is largely due to h@xmath1o .",
    "with respect to the nearby continuum , the equivalent heights of the discrete features in the spectra of the refractive atmosphere are always less than @xmath010 km in the 0.42.5 @xmath4 m spectral range . in going from atmospheric scenarios ( 1 ) to ( 3 )",
    "it is seen that refraction becomes less important as aerosol extinction near the @xmath48 boundary becomes dominant .",
    "the visual inspection of the transmission spectra published by @xcite and @xcite for an earth twin shows that their spectra are generally consistent with our refractionless calculations .    were the sun and earth observed at mid - transit from a remote distance , the transmitted sunlight reaching the remote observer s site would be determined by sunlight photons crossing the earth s atmosphere at altitudes above @xmath01214 km . as seen in fig .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) , ignoring the refractive nature of the earth s atmosphere would mean a significant overestimation of most spectral features .",
    "the overestimation is more obvious when the model atmosphere is assumed free of clouds and aerosols since airborne particles act as natural barriers to the transmission of light through the lower altitudes . because meteorological activity is largely confined to the troposphere , the planet s meteorology will have limited impact on the in - transit transmission spectrum .",
    "the sunlight rays passing closer to the planet s surface at mid - transit originate from the near - limb region of the opposite solar hemisphere . in order to assess the impact of solar limb darkening",
    ", we repeated the calculation for the three scenarios described above including a linear limb - darkening law for the solar brightness , @xmath71 , and @xmath72=0.6 @xcite . to proceed with the comparison",
    ", we redefined @xmath56 in the way : @xmath73 to account for the @xmath74 factor in the limb - darkened solar irradiance , @xmath75 .",
    "our model simulations indicate that @xmath56 differs by less than @xmath01 km in the cases with @xmath72= 0 and 0.6 .",
    "thus , solar limb darkening affects in a negligible way the spectrum s structure at mid - transit .",
    "as in  [ timevar_sec ] , we calculated the equivalent widths of the monomer and cia bands of oxygen at 1.27 @xmath4 m . for the refractive calculations of scenarios ( 1)(3 ) , we obtained that the o@xmath1:cia equivalent widths are in ratios of 1:0.70 , 1:0.64 and 1:0.47 , respectively .",
    "the ratios indicate that the distinct identification of the cia band becomes more and more difficult as the atmospheric opacity of aerosols and clouds increases .",
    "@xcite estimated that the sunlight scattered at the earth s terminator towards the eclipsed moon could amount to up to @xmath010@xmath7610@xmath21 of the solar irradiance depending on the forward - scattering efficiency of the airborne aerosols . during the eclipse ,",
    "the magnitude of scattered sunlight depends on the ratio of the solid angles subtended by the earth , @xmath0@xmath77 , and the sun , @xmath0@xmath78 , from the lunar observer s site on the moon . in the lunar eclipse",
    ", we used for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , 382665.9 km and 1 astronomical unit , respectively .",
    "thus , the amount of stellar light scattered towards the remote observer during the transit is @xmath0(10@xmath7610@xmath21)@xmath19@xmath81/@xmath82@xmath0 10@xmath8310@xmath84 , which is much less than the @xmath010@xmath20 dimming caused by the planet s core or the 10@xmath7610@xmath21 dimming attributable to the strongest atmospheric features .",
    "next , we address under what conditions a lunar eclipse spectrum may be representative of the in - transit transmission spectrum of the remotely - observed earth - sun system . since at mid - transit only altitudes above @xmath01214 km are probed , the eclipse phases matching more closely that condition entail solar elevation angles @xmath14@xmath850.9@xmath34 , which are well within the penumbra @xcite .",
    "thus , spectra from the penumbra , rather than from the umbra , will be better representatives of the in - transit transmission spectrum for the earth - sun system .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite shows an eclipse spectrum at different phases .",
    "the comparison of that figure and our fig .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) confirms that the eclipse spectrum tends to resemble the mid - transit transmission spectrum as the eclipse approaches the umbra / penumbra edge .",
    "we have so far focused on the spectrum at mid - transit , noting the effect of refraction on the equivalent height of the earth s atmosphere with respect to the situation for a virtual non - refractive atmosphere .",
    "the refraction - bending of sunlight rays does , however , introduce phase - dependent effects on the intensity and spectral structure of the transmitted sunlight that are worth exploring .    out of transit",
    ", refraction causes the brightening of the planet s hemisphere more distant from the solar disk .",
    "this effect has been reported for venus transits and causes a transient halo at the planet s limb that is readily discernible from earth with the aid of a small telescope between internal and external contacts .",
    "it is attributed to lomonosov back in the 18th century the correct interpretation of this halo , a fact that , in turn , meant the first evidence for an atmosphere at the planet @xcite .",
    "the last venus transit occurred in june 2004 and provided numerous images of the halo that confirmed the pole - to - equator asymmetry in the optical properties of the planet s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the halo to the net brightness of the planet - star system is tiny for venus but might amount to a detectable magnitude for transiting jovian extrasolar planets on long - duration orbits @xcite .",
    "the halo is a visual representation of the enhancement in the amount of refracted sunlight at the planet s outer hemisphere .",
    "this enhancement occurs together with a diminishment on the opposite hemisphere .",
    "figure ( [ sketch_fig ] ) sketches the situation .",
    "sunlight rays passing through the outer hemisphere may be refracted by an angle of up to @xmath02@xmath86 , whereas on the inner hemisphere refraction angles of more than @xmath02@xmath87 do not contribute to the signal collected by the distant observer .",
    "different refraction angles also mean different depths of the sunlight rays into the atmosphere and , in turn , a refraction ring whose size is larger on the inner hemisphere than on the outer one .    the upper curves in fig .",
    "( [ transit_refr_fig ] ) represent the equivalent heights of the atmosphere from mid - transit ( @xmath14=0@xmath34 ) to internal contact ( @xmath14@xmath880.2641@xmath34 ) .",
    "we omitted limb darkening to emphasize the purely refractive effects , an assumption that enables us to use eq .",
    "( [ heq_eq ] ) as a valid definition for the effective size of the atmosphere .",
    "the calculations assumed the rayleigh atmosphere described above .",
    "the main conclusion to draw from that set of curves is that the earth s optical size varies with the phase of the transit as a result of the refraction of sunlight at the planet s limb .",
    "the earth appears larger near internal contact than at mid - transit because in the proximity of the solar limb the optical enlargement of the inner hemisphere dominates over the shrinking of the outer one .",
    "the overall change in @xmath89 from mid - transit to internal contact amounts to about 3@xmath1910@xmath76 for a variation in the equivalent height of 12 km .",
    "the detection of such a dimming in the stellar light appears extremely challenging , especially after considering that most of the drop occurs near ingress / egress where limb darkening effects on the planet - star lightcurve are more prominent .",
    "the upper set of curves in fig .",
    "( [ transit_refr_fig ] ) also reveals that all molecular band features tend to weaken for phases that move away from mid - transit .",
    "the lower set of curves in fig@xmath90 ( [ transit_refr_fig ] ) represent a measure of the halo brightness from external contact ( @xmath14@xmath880.2690@xmath34 ) to phases well out of the eclipse .",
    "we use an equivalent halo thickness defined through : @xmath91 that gives the thickness of a ring around the planet of the same brightness as the sun for @xmath92=1 .",
    "the effective halo thickness is about 10 km at external contact and decays as the planet moves farther out of transit .",
    "the net brightening at external contact is about 3@xmath1910@xmath76 and , again , probably too faint for detection with the currently existing technology .",
    "we have seen that at mid - transit refraction imposes a ring around the earth s terminator that deflects some line of sights from courses reaching the solar disk or , equivalently , some sunlight rays incident on the planet from courses reaching the remote observer .",
    "the size of this refraction - exclusion ring depends on the refractive properties of the atmosphere but also on the stellar radius and the planet s orbital distance . in standard conditions of temperature and pressure ,",
    "the n@xmath1 and o@xmath1 refractivities are about 1.6 times less than the co@xmath1 refractivity but about twice the h@xmath1 refractivity . for a virtual earth twin whose atmospheric properties remained unchanged when placed in a planetary system other than ours",
    ", the ring will shrink if the planet is closer than 1 au to the star ( @xmath93 ) or if the host star is larger than one solar radius ( @xmath94 ) . the inequality @xmath95@xmath96 1 for the ratio of the refraction - deflected distance , @xmath97 ( with @xmath38@xmath01@xmath34 ) , and the stellar radius establishes the approximate geometrical condition for which a refraction - exclusion ring exists at sub - atmospheric pressures .",
    "speculations on possible values for @xmath95 find their justification in the wide variety of known planetary systems and the even wider variety that is likely to be discovered . as a matter of fact ,",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) applies to a broader range of @xmath98 and @xmath99 parameters than first stated .",
    "the lower synthetic curve represents approximately the condition @xmath98@xmath19@xmath100@xmath1011 and small enough so that refraction has a minor impact on the in - transit transmission spectrum . in turn",
    ", the upper synthetic curve represents the condition @xmath98@xmath19@xmath100@xmath01 .",
    "those two curves bracket all possible conditions for the intermediate values of @xmath98@xmath19@xmath100 .",
    "oxygen is a potential biomarker and therefore constitutes a particularly appealling target for future searches . from our fig .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) , it is seen that the o@xmath1 @xmath67(0)@xmath16@xmath69(0 ) band at 0.76 @xmath4 m may be the best candidate for an oxygen search , although the cia bands at 1.06 and 1.27 @xmath4 m ( the latter blended with the simultaneous monomer band ) are also good candidates when the lowermost layers of the in - transit extrasolar planet are probed .",
    "although refraction will generally pose an additional challenge to the characterization of earth - sized planets , the added difficulty may be minor in some configurations of interest .",
    "that is indeed the case for an earth twin orbiting within the habitable zone ( hz ) of some m - type stars , a planet - star combination that yields relatively favourable areal ratios .",
    "the hz is the distance around a star in which a planet s water might be expected to exist in liquid state .",
    "taking for the hz the reference orbital distance quoted by @xcite , @xmath102 , where , following our earlier convention , subscripts @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote stellar and solar magnitudes , respectively , one arrives at the condition , independent of @xmath105 , @xmath106@xmath107 for the stellar effective temperature below which refraction effects are minor .",
    "if we adopt @xmath38= 1.08@xmath34 at the 1-atm pressure level , the condition becomes @xmath108@xmath1090.5 .",
    "thus , an earth twin that orbited within the hz of an m - type star of effective temperature about 2900 k would produce mid - transit spectra with a closer resemblance to the refractionless simulations in fig .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) than to the refractive simulation of the earth - sun system .",
    "obviously , other intermediate situations would be possible for @xmath110 values in between 2900 and 5800 k.    discussing detectability issues for specific telescope sizes in the way it is done by @xcite or @xcite is beyond the scope of our work .",
    "@xcite do recognize the potential impact of refraction on the lightcurves of earth - sized planets .",
    "they do not , however , give the size of the refraction ring in their investigation of the in - transit transmission spectrum of an earth twin orbiting m - type stars nor explain the way refraction is implemented .",
    "the authors mention an altitude of 6 km below which the terrestrial atmosphere is opaque to grazing sunlight rays but do not state how much of that is contributed by refraction .",
    "as pointed out above , the size of the refraction - exclusion ring depends on the refractive properties of the atmosphere but also on both the stellar radius and the planet s orbital distance . since @xcite account in some cases for",
    "the presence of clouds at altitudes of up to 10 km , the conclusions drawn from their cloudy models of an earth twin might be appropriate for specific conditions in which refraction plays a significant role .",
    "@xcite discussed the in - transit detectability of the strongest absorption features from 0.4 to 2.4 @xmath4 m using scaled versions of the @xcite umbra spectrum . setting the noise terms to zero in eq .",
    "4 of @xcite , the equivalent height proposed in that work can be written as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a specified top - of - the - atmosphere height and @xmath113 is the umbra spectrum normalized to one near 2.2 @xmath4 m .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) shows in red the resulting equivalent heights for the specific case @xmath11440 km investigated in @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the upper ( black ) synthetic curve in the top panel demonstrates that for an earth - like extrasolar planet lacking aerosols and clouds and close enough to a solar - type star so that refraction effects are minor , the approach followed by @xcite overestimates moderately the model predictions for a rayleigh atmosphere .",
    "this is because the umbra spectrum published by @xcite results from probing preferentially the lowermost altitudes of the atmosphere during the eclipse . in all other cases displayed in fig .",
    "( [ transit_fig ] ) , and more especially when refraction effects play a role , the equivalent heights for @xmath11440 km in @xcite are larger by up to an order of magnitude than the current model predictions .",
    "it is apparent that fainter features will impose tougher requirements on their detectability .",
    "we investigated lunar eclipses of the earth and the transits of earth - like extrasolar planets in a comparative manner .",
    "the moon in umbra receives unscattered sunlight that has been transmitted through a section of the terrestrial atmosphere dictated by refraction .",
    "the diffuse sunlight that arrives at the eclipsed moon is scattered from the entire terminator . during the transit of the earth - sun system , at mid - event ,",
    "the refracted sunlight is transmitted through an annular ring that fully encloses the planet .",
    "the refraction - bending of sunlight rays prevents sunlight rays passing through a refraction - exclusion ring above the planet s surface from reaching the remote observer . for the earth - sun system , at mid - transit",
    ", this ring extends up to 1214 km , thus blocking the observer s access to the denser atmospheric layers .",
    "it may be stated that umbra eclipses maximize the contribution of the lowermost atmosphere and , to some extent , of scattered sunlight , whereas during the transit of an earth - like extrasolar planet the transmitted signal is dominated by altitudes above a refraction - exclusion ring and scattered sunlight becomes negligible .",
    "in the course of this work it has become apparent that a genuine transmission spectrum of the earth in transit as observed from a remote distance is more difficult to obtain than what had been anticipated .",
    "lunar eclipse spectra obtained during the penumbra are more representative of the in - transit spectrum than those obtained during the umbra . in the context of earth - like extrasolar planets ,",
    "the lunar eclipse spectra are helpful to fine tune synthetic spectra incorporating the fairly good knowledge of the atmosphere obtained over decades of earth s atmospheric research .",
    "refraction will affect the lightcurves of transiting earth - like extrasolar planets .",
    "its significance will depend on the refractive properties of the planet s atmosphere , the stellar size and the planet s orbital distance .",
    "all these factors must be considered in the future to predict and/or interpret the lightcurves of such planets .",
    "the role of refraction will not be critical for earth twins orbiting within the hz of m - type stars with effective temperatures of about 2900 k and less .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that recent lunar eclipse observations have contributed critically to bring up the importance of refraction in the future characterization of earth - like extrasolar planets .",
