    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) as an extension of the standard model ( sm ) is one major target of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) physics program .",
    "however , we have thus far found no definitive evidence of susy based on the first run of the lhc despite dedicated searches on many fronts .",
    "even so , there is an analysis presented by the cms collaboration that could be showing the first signs of susy  @xcite . in the analysis , two leptons , jets and missing energy",
    "are looked for in the final states .",
    "it is found that there is an excess ( @xmath5 events in the",
    " central \" region ) in the invariant mass distribution of the opposite - sign same - flavour ( ossf ) lepton pair , corresponding to a significance of 2.6 @xmath6 .",
    "the excess of the signal is fitted kinematically as a triangular - shape edge at @xmath7 .",
    "such a kinematic edge is a characteristic signal of susy , where a susy particle undergoes a two - stage two - body decay .",
    "the kinematic edge formed by a pair of leptons can be interpreted as the cascade decay of a neutralino : @xmath8 ( on - shell slepton decay )  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to interpret the edge as a three - body decay signal of a neutralino , @xmath9 , where the lepton pair is produced via an off - shell @xmath10 ( off - shell @xmath10 decay ) .",
    "the shape of the edge would be more rounded as compared to the two - stage two - body decay , but as shown in the original cms analysis , the three - body decay still provides a good fit .",
    "the direct production of @xmath11 is too small to reproduce the dilepton excess , however its production can be boosted if coloured sparticles subsequently decay into @xmath11 .",
    "the explanation of the dilepton excess in terms of coloured sparticles is consistent with the cms analysis , since events with jet multiplicity are selected and counted .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed study on the possibility of explaining the dilepton excess with several susy models taking into account a comprehensive list of lhc constraints from a number of atlas and cms direct susy searches . in order to accurately estimate the lhc constraints and simulate many analyses systematically",
    ", we use the automated simulation tool atom  @xcite .",
    "we take a bottom - up approach by considering simplified susy models with minimal content of particles at low energy to reproduce the excess optimally . as will be discussed in the following sections , light - flavour squarks and sbottoms are potential candidates that satisfy these criteria .",
    "some of these models have already been studied in earlier works @xcite .   here , we will confront our simplified models with various direct susy search constraints such that their viability is tested in great detail .",
    "we will show that the light - flavour squarks and sbottom models we consider in this paper are strongly constrained when providing a large enough contribution to the dilepton excess .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the selection criteria of the cms dilepton analysis . in section  [ sc :",
    "susy ] , we consider susy models that can possibly reproduce the required features of the dilepton edge . in section  [ sc : sim ] , we describe the procedure of our simulation and analysis . we discuss our results and their interpretations in section  [ sc : re ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sc : con ] .",
    "cms reported an excess of events in the dilepton plus missing energy channel  @xcite in the 8 tev , 19.4 fb@xmath12 data .",
    "the analysis requires an ossf lepton pair with @xmath13 gev .",
    "it also requires @xmath14 jets with @xmath15 gev and @xmath16 gev or @xmath17 jets with @xmath15 gev and @xmath18 gev .",
    "the excess is observed in the central region where both leptons satisfy @xmath19 .",
    "it exhibits an @xmath20 in the dilepton invariant mass distribution around @xmath21 gev .",
    "the counting experiment in the @xmath22 $ ] gev region shows an excess of @xmath23 events over the standard model expectation , which corresponds to a standard deviation of 2.6 @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we consider simplified susy models that capture the essence needed for explaining the observed dilepton excess .",
    "generalizations of susy models given here are straightforward .        in the squark scenario , we consider the production of pairs of light - flavour squarks .",
    "this scenario assumes the first two generations of squarks ( both left and right - handed ) to be mass degenerate and within the reach of the lhc , whilst the third generation squarks and gluinos are decoupled .",
    "we also assume that the second lightest neutralino is mostly wino - like or an admixture of wino and higgsinos and the lightest neutralino is mostly bino - like . in this setup",
    "the lighter chargino , @xmath26 , is naturally introduced as a @xmath27 partner of the @xmath11 and their masses have to be close to each other . since the right - handed squarks do not couple to the wino and only very weakly couple to the higgsinos , they decay predominantly into a quark and the @xmath28 , whereas the left - handed squarks can decay to either @xmath26 , @xmath11 or @xmath28 depending on the wino - higgsino mixing in the @xmath26 and @xmath11 .",
    "we consider two models according to the @xmath26 and @xmath11 decay modes .",
    "the first model is the _ on - shell slepton _",

    "any models that lead to multi - lepton final states are severely constrained by the multi - lepton plus missing energy searches  @xcite . to avoid these constraints a large branching ratio of the @xmath31 mode is necessary in this model .",
    "we assume    br ( q_l q + / / ) = 10 / 5 / 85 % .",
    "this can be achieved if @xmath26 and @xmath11 have large higgsino components because the squarks couple to the higgsinos with small yukawa couplings .",
    "we will see in section  [ sc : re_sq ] that our conclusion is not sensitive to variations of the branching ratios .    in the squark with on - shell slepton model",

    "we here need a large branching ratio of @xmath32 such that the small leptonic branching ratio of the off - shell @xmath10 into electrons and muons ( about 6 % ) is compensated .",
    "we assume br ( q_l q + / / ) = 66 / 33 / 1 % , which can be realised by assuming @xmath26 and @xmath11 are wino - like . in the squark with off - shell @xmath10 model we have the following decay chains q_l q q f |f  ( via  z^ * ) & : &   33% , + q_l q q f |f^  ( via  w^ * ) & : &  66% , + q_l q & : &   1% , + q_r q & : &   100% .",

    "unlike in the squark scenario , the decay mode to charginos , @xmath34 , is kinematically forbidden if @xmath35 .",
    "we consider this case because the decay mode to charginos is more constrained due to emergence of top quarks .",
