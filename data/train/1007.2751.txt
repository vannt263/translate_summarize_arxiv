    "2010 , a10 hereafter ) : 831 out of 1451 are classified as agn ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) .",
    "we cross correlated ( ghirlanda et al . 2010 , g10 hereafter ) the  1fgl catalogue with a complete flux limited sample of radio sources detected by the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in a survey conducted at 20 ghz with a flux density limit @xmath940 mjy ( murphy et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the cross correlation led to identify highly probable ( association probability @xmath1180% ) radio counterparts for 230 1fgl sources , i.e. the 1fgl ",
    "at20 g associations hereafter ( see also mahony et al .",
    "222 of these are already classified in the first lat agn catalogue ( 1lac  abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) as bl lacs ( 54 ) , fsrqs ( 112 ) , candidate blazars of unknown class ( 46 ) or other type of agns ( 10 ) . among the generic class of `` agn ''",
    "there are different source types : starburst galaxies ( ngc 253 , m82  abdo et al . , 2010b ) , starburst / seyfert 2 ( ngc 4945  lenc & tingay , 2009 ) a low  excitation fri radio galaxy ( pks 062535  gliozzi et al . , 2008 ) a high  excitation fri radio galaxy ( cen a  abdo et al . 2010f , 2010 g ) , a narrow  line seyfert 1 ( pks 2004447  abdo et al . , 2009b )",
    "the cross correlation of g10 also led to find 8 new associations among which two are classified as fsrq and one as bl lac .",
    "_ therefore most of the 1fgl ",
    "at20 g associations are blazars of the fsrq or bl lac classes . _    the 230 1fgl ",
    "at20 g associations also have typically flat radio spectra with spectral index in the range @xmath12 and centred at @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , the radio at20 g sources associated with a  source of the 1fgl catalog are only a minor fraction ( @xmath31/15 ) of more than 3600 at20 g sources with flat radio spectra ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .    the 230 1fgl ",
    "at20 g associations show a statistically significant correlation between the @xmath0ray flux and the 20 ghz flux density : @xmath1@xmath2 ( see g10 ) .",
    "this correlation has a similar slope when considering bl lacs and fsrqs separately .",
    "the relevance of the  correlation is twofold : it can help to estimate the contribution of blazars to the @xmath0ray background ( e.g. stecker et al . 1993 ) and it could shed light on the physical link between the emission processes in the radio and @xmath0ray energy bands . indeed , the so called  blazar sequence \" ( fossati et al . 1998 , ghisellini et al . 1998 ) was built by dividing blazars into bins of radio luminosity , thought to be a proxy for the bolometric one , and establishes a link between the radio and the @xmath0ray emission .",
    "on the other hand , the radio and @xmath0ray emitting regions are probably different , since the rapid variability of the @xmath0ray flux suggests a compact size ( see e.g. tavecchio et al .",
    "2010 ) , for which the synchrotron spectrum is self  absorbed up to hundreds of ghz .",
    "we therefore believe that the link between the radio and the @xmath0ray emission ( if any ) must be indirect .",
    "one possibility is that both track the jet power , with the radio averaging it on a larger timescale than the @xmath0ray emission .",
    "the radio/@xmath0ray properties of egret blazars suggested the possible existence of a  correlation considering bright @xmath0ray sources ( taylor et al .",
    "2007 ) although at low radio fluxes no conclusive claim could be made ( e.g. mucke et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a possible correlation of  with the radio flux at 8.4 ghz was found in the population of blazars detected by  in its first three months survey ( lbas sample  abdo et al .",
    "this correlation was more significant for bl lacs ( chance probability @xmath16% ) than for fsrqs ( @xmath17% ) .",
    "an updated version of the  correlation , based on the  first year agn catalog , is reported by giroletti et al .",
    "recent studies of the radio@xmath0 flux correlation in the lbas sources ( kovalev et al . 2009a ; 2009b ) was conducted using the mojave sample of extragalactic sources ( with a flux limit of 1.5 jy at 15 ghz ) .",
    "kovalev et al .",
    "( 2009a ) find that the parsec  scale radio emission and the @xmath0ray flux are strongly related in bright @xmath0ray objects , suggesting that  selects the brightest objects from a flux ",
    "density limited sample of radio  loud sources .",
    "the  correlation is subject to the biases related to the flux limits of the radio and @xmath0ray surveys .",
    "however , these biases acting on the radio and the @xmath0ray surveys are independent .",
    "the at20g1lac associations have been found by cross correlating two independent surveys : the radio at20 g ( murphy at el .",
    "2009 ) and the  11 months survey catalogue ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the two main problems we want to tackle in this paper are : ( 1 ) understand why only a minor fraction ( @xmath31/15 ) of radio sources ( of the at20 g survey ) are detected in the @xmath0rays by , despite the possible existence of a correlation between the radio and the @xmath0ray flux ; ( 2 ) recover the true radio@xmath0ray flux correlation by accounting for the selection effects of both the radio and the  survey .    an important aspect which could impact on these issues",
    "is the @xmath0ray variability of blazars .",
    "we will consider in this paper two possible variability patterns : a long term variability which is observed , for instance , when comparing the fluxes measured by egret and ( almost ten years later ) by  for the sources in common , and a short term variability observed so far on daily timescales in the brightest sources .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 the correlation between the @xmath0ray and the radio flux of the at20g  associations is presented and in  3 the duty cycle of blazars in the @xmath0ray band is discussed . in ",
    "4 we describe the method used to reconstruct the true @xmath0ray radio flux correlation and in  5 we show our results and discuss their main possible implications . summary and conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "-0.4 cm -0.3 cm -0.2 cm    fig . [ fg0 ] shows the correlation found by g10 with the 230 1fgl  sources associated with a radio counterpart in the at20 g sample ( squares in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] ) . for these associations we computed the  flux by integrating their spectrum ( reported in the 1fgl catalogue ) above 100 mev .",
    "the best fit ( computed with the bisector method ) of the   correlation is @xmath1@xmath18 . in the following",
    "we will refer to the latter as the  observed correlation \" .",
    "our aim is to account for the possible selection effects acting on the  plane and recover the ",
    "real correlation ``  which can have a different slope and normalization with respect to the observed one . with the ' ' hat \" quantities we indicate the @xmath0 and radio flux of the sources generated through the simulations described in  4 . to these sources",
    "we apply the selection effects in order to reproduce the observed correlation . in the simulations ( see  4 ) we consider the real radio sources adopting their real radio fluxes ( reported in the at20 g survey ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 and @xmath20 coincide , whereas for each real radio source , the @xmath21 is that obtained by assuming a certain @xmath0 ray variability ( described in  3 ) .",
    "the two main selection effects that could bias the  correlation are the flux limit of the at20ghz survey @xmath1140 mjy ( s1 ) and the  detection efficiency in the 0.1100 gev energy band ( s2 ) .",
    "these are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] . while the at20 g radio survey has a well defined 20 ghz flux limit ( shaded grey region in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] ) , the  sensitivity depends on several parameters ( abdo et al .",
    "2010c ) like the source spectrum in the gev band and its position in the sky where the different intensity and anisotropy of the galactic and extra galactic @xmath0ray backgrounds can limit the detection efficiency as a function of the source flux . for instance",
    ", simulations of sources distributed at high galactic latitudes @xmath22 show that the detection efficiency is only 1% for sources with  @xmath23 phot @xmath24 s@xmath25 although such a flux is above the lowest flux measured by  ( abdo et al .",
    "this is due to the combination of two main effects : the intensity of the local background and the source spectral index ( see abdo et al .",
    "2010c for details ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] the  detection efficiency as a shaded coloured region .",
    "this is obtained from the efficiency curve reported in fig .",
    "7 of abdo et al .",
    "( 2010c ) that assumes a distribution of @xmath0ray photon spectral indices centered at @xmath26 and with a dispersion of 0.28 .    considering the distribution of sources in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] and the two instrumental selection effects s1 and s2 , we note that there are two regions in the  plane ( the hatched regions in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] ) where there are no sources .",
    "although source number counts decrease with increasing fluxes ( both in the radio and @xmath0ray band ) , there seems to be no apparent instrumental selection effect preventing the detection of bright @xmath0ray sources with intermediate / low radio fluxes ( in the yellow  hatched upper left triangle ) as well as bright radio sources above the  detection limit ( in the green  hatched lower right triangle ) .",
    "this suggests that the observed correlation is true although we expect that its real slope and normalization can be different from those derived from the observed sources in the  plane because the latter is strongly biased at low  and  by the instrumental selections effects s1 and s2 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] ) .",
    "the variability of the @xmath0ray emission in blazars has been since long discussed in the literature .",
    "it is now with  that robust claims can be done , thanks to an almost continuous monitoring of the @xmath0ray sources in the sky with a relatively high sensitivity which allows to probe both the variations of the flux on long timescales ( increasing with the mission elapsed time ) and on short timescales ( from months down to days for the brightest sources ) .",
    "variability of the @xmath0ray flux of blazars could be the key ingredient to explain why only a minor fraction of the radio sources detected in the at20 g survey have been detected by  in the @xmath0ray band and it could help to reconstruct the true  correlation accounting for the  detection selection effect .    in the following we will refer to two main variability patterns of the @xmath0ray flux of blazars : ( 1 ) a long term variability which seems to follow a log  normal probability distribution with @xmath270.5 and ( 2 ) a short term variability which follows a non symmetric probability distribution skewed towards low flux levels .      in the 3rd egret catalog ( 3eg  hartmann et al .",

    "the egret flux of these 12 sources is above the  detection sensitivity ( shown by the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fg0 ] ) .",
    "they occupy a region where no apparent instrumental selection effect is present . therefore , the non detection of these 3eg sources by  must be due to their @xmath0ray variability over about a decade .",
    "it is interesting to compare the @xmath0ray flux of the sources detected both by egret and ( about 10 years after ) by . when doing this , we must recall that the  fluxes are averages over the 11 months of the survey , while the egret fluxes corresponds to averages over a shorter time interval , typically few months , since they are derived from pointed observations .",

    "we note that this distribution fully comprises also the lower limits of the 12 3eg sources not detected by .",
    "however , given the presence of these lower limits in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fg00 ] , we also tested in our simulations a log  normal variability with @xmath10=0.78 ( represented in fig .",
    "[ fg00 ] by the dashed grey line ) , i.e. corresponding to a variation of the flux by a factor @xmath36 .",
    "if this is representative of a _ decadal flux variability _ of these sources , it explains why a fraction of egret sources were not detected by , despite its better sensitivity .",
    "this result , i.e. the possibility that the gev flux of @xmath0ray blazars ( even if time averaged over @xmath31 year ) can vary by a factor 3 ( at 1@xmath10 ) over @xmath310 years will be used in the next section to reconstruct the true  correlation by accounting for the selection effect s2 .",

    "this correlation is biased by the radio flux limit of the at20 g survey and at low @xmath0ray fluxes by the  sensitivity . however , in the  plane there are regions ( hatched triangles in fig .",

    "we have recovered the true   correlation that can reproduce the observed  one . in doing this",
    "we have considered the two main instrumental selection effects ( radio flux limit and  sensitivity ) and we tested the possibility that the non detection of radio sources by  could be due to the variability of their emission in the @xmath0ray energy range .",
    "tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2010 ) characterized the variability of 3c 454.3 and pks 1510089 , two among the brightest blazars detected by  ( see also foschini et al .",

    "this suggests that the  short \" timescale variability is superimposed on a  decadal \" variability and that the latter has a larger relative variation .",
    "we considered these two variability patterns in our simulations aimed at recovering the true  correlation of the at20g  associations .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] , we can not reproduce the observed  correlation if we adopt the short timescale variability ( and average the flux over 1 year ) . in this case",
    "we over predict the number of simulated sources detectable by  for any combination of the  correlation slope and normalization .",
    "instead , we find ( fig . [ fg3 ] ) that the distribution of real sources in the  plane can be reproduced if the slope of the true  correlation is in the range 1.3 - 1.5 and if the @xmath0ray ( 1year averaged ) flux variability is modeled as a log  normal with @xmath70 0.5 ( acceptable solutions in fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] represented by filled and open circles ) .",
    "we also find that a smaller flux variability , also modeled as a log  normal , can not reproduce the observed  correlation , similarly to what found by assuming the short timescale variability pattern of eq .",
    "[ tav ] .",
    "therefore , we need a  decadal \" @xmath0ray variability which modulates the 1year averaged @xmath0ray flux by at least a factor 3 in order to explain the radio/@xmath0ray statistical behavior of blazars .",
    "the need to assume such a variability pattern is corroborated by the findings on the ratio of egret to  flux for the sources in common , although this is based on the egret sources which are the most luminous ( and maybe the most variable ) .",
    "however , our results show that at least a variability of a factor 3 in flux is necessary to reproduce the observed radio@xmath0 flux correlation .",
    "recent results , obtained after the 11 months  survey , are illuminating : pks 1222 + 216 increased its average @xmath0ray flux by a factor 300 with respect to its average flux during the first 6 months  survey .",
    "this implies that not only the @xmath0ray flux can vary on very short timescales , but also on longer timescales and with an amplitude that is larger than what seen in the radio .    for our simulations",
    ", we we used the  sensitivity computed by abdo et al .",
    "( 2010c ) which assumes a spectral index distribution typical of fsrq sources .",
    "although the  sensitivity depends on the source spectral index ( e.g. abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) , our sample of 1fgl ",
    "at20 g associations is dominated by fsrq sources .",
    "nonetheless , for bl lac objects , due to their harder spectrum , a lower  detection limit ( represented by the shaded region s2 in fig.[fg0 ] ) should be considered for these sources .",
    "we remark that based only on the radio data we can not distinguish in our simulations between fsrq and bl lac objects among the radio sources with flat radio spectrum but without a @xmath0ray counterpart . however , if a lower detection sensitivity would be used in our simulations , a combination of a slightly smaller normalization and slope of the  correlation possibly coupled with a slightly larger variability of the @xmath0ray flux would be required to reproduce the  correlation .",
    "still the results would be comparable with those derived with the detection sensitivity of fsrq .    as a result of the existence of the  correlation and of the long  timescale variability",
    "we also expect that the brightest radio blazars ( e.g. with radio flux density @xmath93 jy ) will always be detected by  since the variability of the @xmath0ray flux can not make them much fainter ( on average , short duration events at very low fluxes can occur ) .",
    "our result also implies that if the average fluxes in the radio and @xmath0ray bands are correlated , then also a decadal radio flux variation should be expected and with a positive time delay if the radio emitting region is larger than the one emitting the @xmath0rays , and thus is located further out along the jet .",
    "however , our fluxes are collected at different epochs : the radio data are single snapshots obtained by the at20 g survey in the period 20042008 while the  fluxes are averages over 11 months survey between 2008 and 2009 .",
    "pushkarev et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown that there exists a strong correlation between the 15.4 ghz core vlba flux density and the @xmath0ray one and that these two fluxes are correlated with a typical delay distributed between 1 and 8 months ( in the observer frame ) which is interpreted as caused by opacity effects .",
    "this study , on the correlation of _ fluxes _ , is related to the possibility that there exists a correlation between the @xmath0ray and the radio _ luminosities _ in blazars ( as found e.g. by bloom et al .",
    "2008 and discussed in mucke et al .",
    "although based on the fraction ( 144 ) of the at20g  associations with measured redshifts , we showed that a strong correlation exists between the radio luminosity and the @xmath0ray one and that , considering fsrqs and bl lac objects , it is linear .",
    "we also verified , through partial correlation analysis , that this correlation is not due to the common dependence of the luminosities on redshift for fsrqs ( null hypothesis probability of the partial correlation , removing the redshift dependence , @xmath71 ) , while only a marginal claim can be made for bl lacs alone .",
    "the other main consequence of the existence of a  correlation in blazars is that it could be used to estimate the contribution of these sources to the @xmath0ray background ( abdo et al .",
    "the contribution of blazars can be estimated considering the true  correlation and the population of radio sources with flat radio spectra ( i.e. candidate blazars ) in the at20 g survey .",
    "we estimate that the blazar contribution to the extragalactic diffuse background is between 37% and 52% ( according to the parameters of the assumed  correlation ) of which 17% is the contribution from non  detected sources .",
    "considering that our estimates are based on a flux limited sample of radio sources ( i.e. those with 20 ghz flux larger than 40 mjy ) we should expect that if the radio flux limit is further decreased , the number of sources should increase .",
    "while detailed predictions depends on the still poorly known @xmath72 of radio sources at very low flux levels , we should expect that the contribution of blazars to the egrb can even be larger than our present estimates based on a radio flux limited sample .",
