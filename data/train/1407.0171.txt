    "the effort to detect gravitational waves with an array of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) continues to gain momentum .",
    "one example of the maturity of this effort is the special focus issue of _ classical and quantum gravity _",
    "@xcite , comprised of 16 articles on pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) that detail their promise , current status , and major challenges .",
    "one substantial challenge is correcting for time - varying propagation delays due to passage of the radio waves through the partially ionized interstellar medium ( ism ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the motion of the pulsar , ism , and the earth all contribute to the time variability of various propagation delays , with different weighting for each type of delay .",
    "frequency - dependent ( @xmath6 ) dispersion , quantified by the dispersion measure ( dm ) , produces the largest time delay of typically tens to hundreds of ms at 1  ghz , depending on the pulsar . because this is such a large effect compared to the @xmath7  10  ns timing correction goal that is commonly pursued , all three ptas  the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves , the european pulsar timing array , and the parkes pulsar timing array",
    " employ active dm - variability mitigation schemes @xcite .    the second - most - important delay , that due to multi - path scattering , is generally not corrected for in timing efforts at frequencies near 1 ghz . the approximately @xmath8 dependence of this delay makes it less important as a direct effect . for small scattering time delays @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pulse width",
    ", the main effect is to delay the arrival of the pulse by @xmath11 , with negligible time - smearing @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as we move towards timing pulsars at the 10-ns level of precision , it is important to begin estimating and correcting for this delay .",
    "one should also consider indirect effects of scattering delay on precision pulsar timing .",
    "for example , dms to pulsars included in the ptas are determined by multiple - frequency observations , including frequencies near 400  mhz , where scattering delays can be substantial ( about 150 times larger than at 1.4  ghz ) , with the potential to bias and cause time - variability in dm estimates and , hence , in the reported arrival time .    here",
    "we present a pilot study for temporal monitoring of this scattering delay .",
    "although the frequencies of choice for high - precision timing of msps remain around 13 ghz , we explore the scattering delay of msps at frequencies around 150  mhz for two reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath11 means that the effects of scattering are strong at these frequencies .",
    "second , the lofar ( low - frequency array ) telescope provides 80  mhz of bandwidth at these frequencies , where 12  mhz was typical for previous instruments .",
    "this , coupled with lofar s high sensitivity and versatility @xcite , makes it an excellent instrument with which to explore scattering delays . as we discuss further below , the advent of a new signal processing technique ",
    "cyclic spectroscopy ( cs )  plays a central role in the results presented here .",
    "prior to the availability of cs in radio astronomy , it was not possible to achieve the required fine frequency resolution and pulse phase resolution simultaneously .    in the past , several approaches have been taken to estimate the scattering delay , @xmath11 .",
    "these can , in general , be divided into time - domain and frequency - domain techniques , depending on whether time - domain fitting of a scatter - broadening function was applied to average profiles @xcite or whether an autocorrelation analysis or similar was applied to the scintillation - modulated spectrum of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "although the correspondence between the scattering timescale and the diffractive scintillation bandwidth ( or decorrelation bandwidth ) , @xmath12 , is known to be more complicated than this @xcite , the standard formula for relating the two quantities is conventionally taken to be @xmath13 , and we will use that in the present work .",
    "previous work has shown that time - domain fitting is complicated by the evolution of average profiles with observing frequency @xcite .",
    "although msp profiles do not evolve with frequency as strongly as do those of some slowly rotating pulsars , they typically have more complex profiles with larger duty cycles .",
    "both of those features make time - domain fitting for scattering delay potentially inaccurate . as an attractive alternative ,",
    "we employ frequency - domain analysis of the spectra in order to characterize the diffractive bandwidth @xmath12 .    in  2 we present the pilot observations we have made for three msps . then ,",
    "in  3 we give details of our analysis procedure .",
    "finally , in  4 we present our results and discuss their implications for the prospect of correcting msp precision timing for the effect of time - variable scattering delay .",
    "we used lofar baseband data from observations of , , and obtained for other purposes @xcite on three occasions from late 2012 through early 2014 for the analysis described below .",
    "since psr  j1810 + 1744 is in a black - widow system @xcite , we ensured that our observation ( at orbital phases 0.780.80 ) was well away from the eclipse centered at orbital phase 0.25 .",
    "all data were acquired in coherent beam - formed mode using the central lofar core stations . as described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , baseband data were recorded and stored in 400 subbands of width 195 khz spanning the frequency range from approximately 110190  mhz .",
    "each 195-khz subband was coherently dedispersed and then , in a manner described below , divided into 1024 frequency channels for a final frequency resolution of @xmath14  hz spanning a total of 80  mhz .",
    "this narrow frequency resolution was needed to analyze the khz - scale modulation produced by multi - path scattering in this frequency range .     computed from our measured @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : profiles],width=312 ]    traditional pulsar spectral processing operates on a coherently dedispersed baseband data stream and fourier - transforms by a factor of 4 , 8 , 16 , or more .",
    "] short segments of duration @xmath15 to form an @xmath16-channel filter bank ( with channels of width @xmath17 ) .",
    "these spectra are then averaged modulo the pulsar period to form a ( radio - frequency , pulse - phase - bin ) 2d array that is accumulated for a subintegration length which is typically 1060  s. this array then allows rfi excision and averaging over frequency to produce profiles like those in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , which are the primary input to pulsar timing",
    ". however , the constraint @xmath18 inherent in this approach poses a fundamental problem for scintillation studies of msps at low radio frequencies because small values of @xmath17 and @xmath15 are needed simultaneously ( e.g.  we needed @xmath19  hz and @xmath20s for one of the pulsars in our study , requiring @xmath21 ) .",
    "fortunately , the application of cs to observations of pulsars @xcite makes such analysis possible .",
    "cs generalizes spectral analysis to _ periodically _ varying signals @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can choose @xmath15 to be as long as a subintegration length ( often tens of seconds ) without impacting pulse phase resolution @xmath22 .",
    "this separation of @xmath15 and @xmath22 offers the possibility to study scintillation in the frequency domain while still retaining @xmath22 short enough to resolve scattering tails in the pulse - phase domain .",
    "the computed quantity is known as the periodic spectrum @xcite , or in other application areas as the wigner - ville spectrum @xcite .",
    "its interpretation ranges from straightforward , as here , to quite subtle , depending on the application .    in our processing",
    ", for each 195-khz subband , periodic spectrum estimates were formed modulo the pulse period with a pulse - phase resolution @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the pulsar period .",
    "this resulted in @xmath25 100  @xmath26s , 25  @xmath26s , and 50  @xmath26s for the pulsars psr  b1257 + 12 , psr  j1810 + 1744 , and psr  j2317 + 1439 , respectively .",
    "the periodic spectrum is a real - valued second - order product of the baseband data that can be accumulated over time .",
    "it has dimensions @xmath27 by @xmath28 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the number of frequency channels and pulse phase bins , respectively .",
    "we integrated the periodic spectrum for @xmath29  s ( shorter than the diffractive timescale ) to form a set of @xmath30 subintegrations producing a final data cube denoted @xmath31 .",
    "this processing was accomplished with the dspsr program @xcite , which incorporates cs as well as a wide range of state - of - the - art pulsar signal processing code .",
    "the version of dspsr -cyclic initially available to us allowed serious spectral leakage of narrow - band radio - frequency - interference ( rfi ) signals .",
    "since the majority of interfering signals in the lofar high band are of this character we added a polyphase - filter - like step ( activated with the -cyclicoversample option ) to the dspsr code and propagated this to the main code repository .",
    "this sufficiently isolated narrow - band rfi , which was then removed in the next processing step .",
    "processing continued on 4-mhz ( psr  j1810 + 1744 ) or 8-mhz `` parts , '' which are the subband aggregates written by the beamformer ; for each we assembled a data cube by concatenating the @xmath32 data cubes for each subband in the frequency direction . the real - valued periodic spectra ( see , e.g. , figure  2 in demorest 2011 ) are pulse - phase - resolved representations of the frequency structure imposed by multi - path scattering , but on a scale finer than @xmath33 .",
    "it is easily verified from the construction of the periodic spectrum that averaging it over all phases exactly recovers the traditional spectrum .",
    "omitting from this average phase ranges where there is no pulsar signal , either intrinsic or scattered , can not affect the obtained spectrum , and allows estimation of the non - pulsar components of the measured spectrum .",
    "this posed no problem for processing the psr  b1257 + 12 and psr  j2317 + 1439 data , but it did cause some problems for analyzing the psr  j1810 + 1744 data in the lower frequency range , as we comment on below .",
    "the upper panel shows the result of averaging the same dynamic spectrum over time .",
    "note the two bright scintles visible in this plot .",
    "most scintles , even for this relatively bright pulsar , are too faint to see individually , appearing only when statistically combined using an autocorrelation .",
    "[ fig : dynspec],width=312 ]    for each pulsar , we chose an on - pulse phase gate of width @xmath34 and a similar off - pulse gate of width @xmath35 . by averaging over these phase",
    "ranges we created on- and off - pulse 2d data slices @xmath36 .",
    "we then formed the dynamic spectrum array @xmath37 . requiring @xmath38 , where @xmath10 is the intrinsic pulse width and @xmath11 is the duration of the multi - path scattering tail , ensures that this recovers the traditional dynamic spectrum .",
    "we show a very small section of the dynamic spectrum for psr  j1810 + 1744 in figure  [ fig : dynspec ] , where we focus attention on several bright interference maxima or `` scintles '' .",
    "although rfi had been isolated by the polyphase filtering step , it was still a significant problem for our frequency - domain analysis .",
    "we manually excised all regions in frequency - subintegration space containing rfi spikes .",
    "we also corrected for the digitally - determined bandpass shape of each 195-khz subband imposed by a front - end polyphase filter and blanked out the edges of each polyphase subband , where the power aliased from the other side of the subband was more than 10% of the total power ; this required blanking approximately 10% of the band in every observation .",
    "once the rfi excision was accomplished , we analyzed each 4- or 8-mhz part individually using a standard autocorrelation function ( acf ) analysis ( e.g. cordes et al .",
    "1985 ) on the final spectra comprised of either 20480 channels ( for psr  j1810 + 1744 ) or 40960 channels .",
    "the resulting acf was then fit to a lorentzian function @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath12 is the conventional diffractive bandwidth ( hwhm of the frequency acf function for small values of @xmath40 , as was the case here ) , where the offset @xmath40 and scale - factor @xmath41 are not relevant to this study .",
    "we ignore the zero - lag noise spike as part of this fit , but use it to estimate the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath42 .",
    "a lorentzian acf is the appropriate functional form if the image point - spread function due to scattering is gaussian and , hence , the pulse - broadening function is a one - sided exponential @xcite . to aid manual inspection of fit quality , we downsampled the dynamic spectrum where necessary to obtain approximately 16 bins across the acf peak .",
    "an example of calculated acf and fitted function for psr  j1810 + 1744 are shown in figure  [ fig : acf ] .",
    "khz , corresponding to a scattering time delay of @xmath43  @xmath26s .",
    "[ fig : acf],width=312 ]    a simple calculation of the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the acf yields the expression r_= b ( ) ^2 . [",
    "eqn : snr ] here , @xmath44 is the phase - averaged pulsar flux density , sefd is the system equivalent flux density , @xmath41 is the total bandwidth , and @xmath45 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "this assumes that the spectra are integrated for the diffractive scintillation time @xmath46 ; after that , the acfs are incoherently averaged up to the total integration time @xmath47 .",
    "raw sensitivity is clearly vital because of the squared ratio of signal strength to system noise .",
    "note that because @xmath48 and @xmath49 for anticipated ism conditions , we expect that @xmath50 , which should be visible across the lofar band , although the sefd and gain degrade away from the center of the band @xcite , which will partially offset this improvement .",
    "a summary of relevant observational details and the results of this acf fitting process are presented in table  [ table : parms ] . as indicated there ,",
    "the fitted parameters for psr  j1810 + 1744 are well constrained .",
    "however , the acfs for the other two pulsars were much weaker , as indicated by the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath42 and by the error estimates on @xmath12 in table  [ table : parms ] .",
    "this follows because the s / n of the time - domain data ( e.g.  the time - averaged pulsar flux divided by the noise rms in the pulse profile , corrected for the number of phase bins ) was a factor of 34 smaller than for psr  j1810 + 1744 , and equation ( [ eqn : snr ] ) shows that this will result in a factor of 915 degradation in @xmath42 if the sefd is comparable for each of these pulsars .",

    "fig : dbw ] we show results for the three msps in this pilot study .     as a function of frequency for psr  j1810 + 1744 in the lofar high band .",
    "the best - fit power law is shown as a solid line and the best - fit power law with a slope of 4 as a dotted line .",
    "[ fig : dbw],width=312 ]    only the psr  j1810 + 1744 data are of high enough quality to comment on the log  @xmath12 vs.  log  @xmath4 slope over the lofar band .",
    "we find a logarithmic slope of @xmath52 over this range , consistent with predictions for a thin - screen , kolmogorov turbulence model of unlimited transverse extent ( @xmath53 ) , but also consistent with numerous other plausible models @xcite .",
    "in particular , a break in the power - law to a smaller value of @xmath54 at lower frequencies could indicate an `` inner scale '' to the density variations or a truncation of the scattering disc at large spatial scales @xcite .",
    "we note that for the psr  j1810 + 1744 data selection of an on - pulse region poses a difficult decision .",
    "including phase ranges where there is little or no signal reduces the signal - to - noise .",
    "however , while averaging the periodic spectrum over all signal - containing phases does produce the familiar spectrum , examining both simulated spectra and those observed for psr  b1937 + 21 @xcite shows that the frequency structure of a scattered pulse narrows as one moves to later phases in which the scattering tail dominates . omitting these later phases biases the @xmath12 estimate upwards . since the scattering tail lengthens substantially at lower frequencies , this could produce a break in the power law relation between @xmath12 and @xmath4 , mimicking the effect of an inner scale or a truncated screen .",
    "this effort aimed at exploring lofar s potential for frequency - domain studies of multi - path scattering in the ism . based on results from the bright msp psr  j1810 + 1744 and two other moderately bright msps we find good potential for further studies , which we are embarking upon .",
    "we have shown that cs is a powerful and essential tool for studying msp scintillation at lofar frequencies , and we have improved upon its implementation in the standard pulsar signal - processing package dspsr .",
    "this pilot study also serves to demonstrate the power that the low - frequency ( 50 - 350  mhz ) component of the square kilometre array ( ska - low ) will have for such studies .",
    "ska - low will provide an order - of - magnitude improvement in sensitivity over lofar , and can thus serve as a powerful ism monitor to support high - precision timing at higher observing frequencies .",
    "there are two major challenges to expanding these studies to other msps .",
    "the first problem is raw sensitivity . despite lofar s large collecting area and state - of - the - art architecture , we only had borderline detections of scintillation structure for two moderately bright msps",
    ". admittedly this was in 1200-s data blocks  and we note that these observations were earlier in the commissioning process  but equation ( [ eqn : snr ] ) emphasizes that narrow @xmath12 requires high instantaneous sensitivity or a compensating increase in ( incoherent ) integration time . because of the lower sky temperature at higher frequencies , some msps will be better studied in the range 300500  mhz using this method .",
    "secondly , as was true for psr  j1810 + 1744 in this study , a combination of large duty cycle ( @xmath55 ) and/or substantial values of @xmath11 at low frequency means that there will be limited or no off - pulse baseline for some pulsars .",
    "this makes it difficult to determine the traditional spectrum accurately from the periodic spectrum , which possesses interference structure out to at least the quadratic sum of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , in future observations of psr  j1810 + 1744 and similar high - duty - cycle or heavily scattered msps , we plan to use lofar s multi - beaming capability to provide off - source calibration .",
    "for very heavily scattered pulsars it may also be necessary to apply these techniques at higher frequencies , using baseband - output or realtime cyclic - spectroscopy backends of other telescopes .",
    "the ultimate goal of this work is to improve the timing accuracy of msps at gigahertz frequencies . in order to accomplish that we plan to expand the sample of msps studied with lofar and to make multi - epoch observations of them .",
    "we will compare these results with what is known at frequencies around 1  ghz about multi - path scattering and its temporal variations for many of these pulsars @xcite . as has become common for studies attempting to improve the pulsar - based gravitational - wave detector ,",
    "this work is likely to lead to increased understanding of another area of astrophysics , in this case the ionized ism .",
