    "in two 1999 papers this author suggested the hypothesis that @xmath3 was a @xmath5 tachyon , based on a pair of cosmic ray analyses.@xcite here we discuss six observations based on data from cmb fluctuations , gravitational lensing , neutrino mixing , @xmath1 double beta decay , and cosmic rays that are consistent with that hypothesis , and which yield the revised estimate for the @xmath3 mass of @xmath6 or equivalently @xmath7 where @xmath8  see a summary in table i and fig .",
    "the first 1999 claim was based on a model@xcite that fit the cosmic ray spectrum , assuming the knee is the threshold for proton beta decay .",
    "as shown by chodos et al.@xcite this process becomes energetically allowed if the electron neutrino is a tachyon and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the proton mass and q is the negative q - value for the decay  see supplementary animation file.@xcite the model s essential feature was that the decay of cosmic ray protons when @xmath11 results in a decay chain : @xmath12 that continues until the baryon s energy drops below @xmath13 shifting them to lower energies , and thereby ( a ) giving rise to the knee , and ( b ) a pile - up of neutrons just above it , i.e. , a small peak at @xmath14@xcite neutrons , mostly point back to their sources , unlike protons whose directions are affected by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "thus , if the baryon in the decay chain spends a significant proportion of its time as a neutron , much of its directional information should be preserved .",
    "moreover , the hypothesized decay chain could allow pev neutrons to reach us from sources normally considered too distant , given the neutron lifetime .",
    "the second 1999 paper@xcite claimed evidence for @xmath15 peak centered on @xmath16 based on lloyd - evans data for cygnus x-3.@xcite apart from skepticism of this claim , there is also much skepticism about cygnus x-3 ever being a source of pev cosmic rays .",
    "however , the basis of that skepticism may be poorly justified , especially if cygnus x-3 is an episodic source , and if a weak @xmath17 signal needs cuts to suppress background , as discussed in detail in appendix i of ref .",
    "given the nature of the tachyon neutrino hypothesis , however , and the alternative explanations that existed for those earlier cosmic ray analyses the hypothesis has not been taken seriously in the cosmic ray community .",
    "it is therefore important that among the six observations only two involves cosmic ray physics .",
    "listed in table 1 .",
    "the error bars , except for e , are based on values from fits to data done by other researchers .",
    "the dashed vertical line and the width of the shaded rectangle show the weighted average mass and its uncertainty .",
    "when the weights are chosen as @xmath18 this weighted average corresponds to doing a least squares fit to the six observations to a vertical straight line .",
    "three of the six error bars are shown light grey , which denotes that the inclusion of these items is more conditional than the others : f denotes a disputed experimental result for which the sign of @xmath19 is indeterminate , and b and c denote two alternative interpretations of the same cosmological data , only one of which might be true.,width=302 ]    .[tab : table1 ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the observations consist of interpretations of published data and fits to those data , and in each case it is possible to compute a value for @xmath20 where the @xmath21 are found by error propogation , given the uncertainty in the least well - known quantity on which @xmath22 depends .",
    "the consistency of the six observations with the stated mass requires making a variety of explicitly stated assumptions , as discussed in what follows .",
    "direct tests of the masses of the neutrinos from particle physics and cosmology usually are only able to set upper limits .",
    "for example , the two most precise experiments measuring the spectrum of tritium beta decay yield @xmath23 @xcite , while in one recent investigation davies and moss ( dm ) have set an upper limit on the magnitude of the mass of any tachyonic neutrino based on cosmology as @xmath24@xcite    dm place this upper bound on the neutrino mass using a relation they derive as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the effective number of neutrino species defined in terms of the energy densities of neutrinos and photons at the time of nucleosynthesis , @xmath28 is the temperature of neutrino decoupling , and @xmath29 is the temperature at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "dm actually write eq .",
    "2 as an upper bound on @xmath30 rather than an actual value , since they use an upper bound on @xmath31 and not an actual value .",
    "they then use eq . 2 to cite several values of that upper bound which depend on their assumptions for the parameters .",
    "the more conservative of their two upper bounds is found using data on cmb fluctuations , for which @xmath29 is replaced by @xmath32 the temperature at matter - radiation equality for which density fluctuations start to grow .",
    "dm use values for @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 from which they obtain @xmath36 however , if we substitute in eq .",
    "2 a more up to date value for @xmath37 based on cmb fluctuations and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn),@xcite we obtain an actual value for @xmath30 rather than an upper bound : @xmath38 where the uncertainty @xmath39 is here taken to be @xmath40 based on the propagation of errors for the @xmath41 uncertainty in @xmath42  the chief source of uncertainty in the dm calculation .",
    "it is also assumed that the neutrino that is the source of dark energy is @xmath43      a second observation is based on results from a 2014 article by battye and moss ( bm).@xcite bm perform fits to five data sets involving the cmb and lensing measurements in order to determine the sum of the 3 active neutrino masses , under two scenarios : 3 + 0 , i.e. , only three active neutrinos , and 3 + 1 , three active and one sterile neutrino .",
    "very similar fits were reported about the same time by hamann and hasenkamp.@xcite both pairs of authors note that their fits are able to resolve a pair of discrepancies that exists between cmb and lensing data , and they obtain values that are significantly different from zero rather than merely upper limits for the sum of the neutrino masses .",
    "the bm best fit for the case of three active neutrinos only is @xmath44 which is about @xmath45 from zero .",
    "bm note that given the large value found for @xmath46 compared to much smaller values of @xmath47 from neutrino oscillation experiments the neutrino masses would need to be nearly degenerate , which would apparently yield @xmath48 below we discuss an alternative interpretation of their result , which allows for the possibility of some of the neutrino flavors being tachyons .",
    "the basis of using fits to cmb and lensing data to deduce a value for @xmath49 starts with the dependence of those data on the spatial energy density of neutrinos @xmath50 at the time when the cmb fluctuations started to grow .",
    "the overall @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of the three neutrino flavor masses and their associated number densities : @xmath51 however , since the number densities should be all equal , given that the flavors were produced in equal abundance in earlier very high energy interactions , we have @xmath52 it has long been known that tachyons can have a negative energy,@xcite , and that negative energy density offers a simple way to explain dark energy,@xcite , one form of which might involve a sea of tachyonic neutrinos.@xcite a negative energy density for tachyonic neutrinos @xmath53 requires that their mass @xmath54 be considered to be negative since their spatial number density , @xmath55 can not be , but note that we are referring here to their gravitational mass , not their kinematic mass , which is of course imaginary .",
    "given the foregoing , if only the electron neutrino were a tachyon the bm result would need to be written as :    @xmath56    now , the measured @xmath47 values from oscillation experiments are between neutrino mass not flavor states , where the relationship between the masses of the two types of states assuming cp conservation can be expressed as :    @xmath57    and conversely :    @xmath58    it was noted earlier that bm used the near - degeneracy of the three mass states as required by the smallness of @xmath47 relative to @xmath59 , to argue that the three flavor states are also nearly degenerate , which is clear from eq .",
    "however , if one or more of the three neutrino flavors is a tachyon the preceding no longer logically follows .",
    "if we were , however , to assume the @xmath60 of the three flavor masses are nearly equal , i.e. , @xmath61 then eq .",
    "3 would imply : @xmath62 or @xmath63 thus , we interpret the bm 3 + 0 fit result as being consistent with there being three active flavor neutrinos of nearly equal magnitude masses , and no sterile neutrinos .",
    "two of the flavors are assumed to comprise a tachyon - tardyon pair , which is very similar to a recent model by chodos discussed below.@xcite as we shall see , there is a simple way for such a large magnitude @xmath64 to satisfy the constraints imposed by the small values of @xmath65 from oscillation experiments .",
    "theories of tachyonic neutrinos have encountered difficulties in terms of satisfying lorentz invariance ( li ) , a matter that some theorists have tried to deal with through possible alternatives to the lorentz group.@xcite of possible relevance is very special relativity ( vsr ) , introduced by cohen and glashow , which involves reducing the symmetry to a subgroup of the lorentz group that produces nearly all the consequences of li.@xcite in contrast , chodos has devised a new symmetry he calls light cone reflection ( lcr ) , which enlarges the sim(2 ) symmetry of vsr.@xcite he shows that one can construct a lagrangian describing neutrinos that satisfies lcr , in which @xmath66 neutrino pairs arise naturally .",
    "thus , the chodos model explicitly requires neutrinos come in tachyon - tardyon pairs having the same magnitude mass , just as we have suggested for two of the three neutrino flavors . while the presence of a third unpaired neutrino would seem to present a problem for the chodos model , it is natural to imagine that it could be resolved by having a fourth sterile neutrino in addition to the three active ones .    as noted earlier bm in one version of their fits",
    "consider this 3 + 1 scenario .",
    "unfortunately for the chodos model , their best fit in this case yields @xmath67 and @xmath68 for which the three active neutrino masses would need to have masses far smaller than the sterile one , a result that seemingly rules out the possibility of two tachyon - tardyon @xmath66 pairs .",
    "nevertheless , there is a way to achieve consistency with the chodos model .",
    "the assumption made by bm in doing their fits was that the minimum possible value for @xmath49 is 0.06 ev based on neutrino oscillation @xmath47 values .",
    "however , that assumption would be incorrect if some of the neutrino flavor masses are tachyons .",
    "in fact if two rather than one of them is a tachyon there would be two negative mass terms in eq",
    ". 3 , and the result for @xmath49 would be negative under the chodos model . since bm report a ",
    "best fit \" value for @xmath49 right at the lower end ( @xmath69 ) of the assumed allowed region , this fact strongly suggests that the true best fit does indeed lie below 0.06 ev and is possibly negative  particularly if the likelihood function were continually rising as the value of @xmath49 descended toward 0.06 ev .",
    "interestingly , bm do not show a plot of their likelihood function for @xmath49 in the 3 + 1 case , even though they do show it for the 3 + 0 case .",
    "if bm or other investigators should choose to explore the @xmath70 region in doing their 3 + 1 fitting , it would be quite interesting to see if the best fit is in accord with the chodos model . specifically , since the model requires the four neutrinos constitute two @xmath66 pairs , then we should find : @xmath71 we should note , however , that such a result would be equally compatible with a 3 + 3 scenario , where the two additional sterile neutrinos constitute a third @xmath66 pair that would add equal magnitude @xmath72 masses to the right hand side of @xmath71    let us assume the existence of a sterile neutrino mass state @xmath73 accompanying the usual 3 active mass states with masses @xmath74 having a standard mass hieracrchy .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath75 and @xmath76 because otherwise it would be impossible to have a tachyonic @xmath3 with @xmath77 under these assumptions the four flavor state masses can be found from :    @xmath78 \\approx m_1 ^ 2 ( 1-|u_{i4}|^2 ) + m_4 ^ 2|u_{i4}|^2\\ ] ]    where @xmath79 there are many ways eq .",
    "6 can yield two pairs of flavor states having @xmath66 masses with @xmath80 constituting one pair , and hence satisfying : @xmath81 in this case we can use the value for @xmath82 that battye and moss found in their 3 + 1 best fit to obtain @xmath83 or @xmath84 unfortunately , however , all solutions with only one sterile neutrino yield too large a degree of active - sterile mixing . based on neutrino oscillation data , for example",
    ", it is found that @xmath85@xcite which is far less than the minimum value possible using eq . 6",
    "that can be easily shown to be 0.5 . however , with @xmath86 sterile neutrinos many solutions exist that have an arbitrarily small degree of active sterile mixing , and which yield three @xmath66 pairs ",
    "see appendix i. thus , the third observation that @xmath87 uses the bm 3 + 1 fit result in the context of the chodos model . of",
    "the bm fits to the cmb and lensing data in this section and the preceding one , the one in this section is preferred , since the 3 + 0 fit ( sect .",
    "iib ) can not be compatible with very small @xmath88 from oscillation experiments .",
    "recall that the original basis of the predicted @xmath89 peak was that cosmic ray protons were hypothesized to decay when @xmath90 if @xmath3 is a tachyon , which is how the 1999 estimate for @xmath91 was obtained .",
    "the position of the knee for cosmic ray protons is now known to depend on cosmic ray composition , and for protons it is claimed to be @xmath92@xcite which when substuted in eq .",
    "1 yields @xmath93 the observation in support of this result consists of data reported by the tunka collaboration,@xcite which is interpreted here as providing further evidence for the predicted @xmath89 peak .",
    "most earlier cosmic ray experiments exploring the knee region show merely a change in power law , i.e. , a knee .",
    "tunka , however , reports seeing  remarkable fine structure \" in the knee region and at higher energies for their all - particle spectrum  see fig . 2 here .",
    "tunka authors attribute the observed fine structure to a combined source model where cosmic rays around the knee are produced by the group of sn ia remnants and the extragalactic light component ( in accordance with  dip model ) arises in the energy region of @xmath94     extracted from the tunka paper ( reference 13 ) together with two straight lines representing with a change in the power law from @xmath95 to @xmath96 at @xmath97 .",
    "these three numerical values were chosen maximize the prominence of the peak near 5 pev .",
    "the error bars in ( a ) are smaller than the points plotted . in ( b )",
    "we see the excess flux above those two straight lines as a function of energy in pev . lacking error bars",
    ", it was not possible to due a true fit , and make a null test of the peak .",
    "note that only in ( a ) is the flux multiplied by @xmath98 which accounts for @xmath99 vanishing for @xmath100 in ( b).,width=377 ]    as noted in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) , however , the fine structure seen could also be characterized as consisting of a noticeable peak in the range @xmath101 superimposed on a straight change in power law at about 3 pev , i.e. , the knee . assuming the peak is real , it is possible that very good energy resolution is needed in order to see it  in tunka s case @xmath102 for @xmath103.@xcite indeed , if we artificially blur the tunka data in energy corresponding to a resolution of @xmath104 the evidence for any peak largely disappears . moreover , as the tunka authors note , a similar fine structure has been seen above the knee in some other recent experiments , including kascade grande@xcite and ice top.@xcite see for example fig . 8 in ref .",
    "@xcite which shows the same dip tunka sees at about 20 pev in those two experiments  a dip that gives rise to the peak seen in our fig .",
    "2 ( b ) .",
    "another feature in the cosmic ray spectrum known as the ` second knee ' ( a second abrupt increase in spectral softness ) has been observed recently in the vicinity of @xmath105 by the taiga collaboration,@xcite and it was also noted previously by three other experiments at a slightly higher energy ( 330 pev).@xcite .",
    "the second most abundant nucleus in the cosmic rays is helium , so if we have interpreted the first knee as the threshold for proton beta decay it is reasonable to expect the less prominent second knee as being due to @xmath106 decay via the reaction having a final state @xmath3 or @xmath107 that has the lowest threshold ( least negative q - value ) :    @xmath108    note that the sudden onset of this process results in more and more @xmath109 particles being replaced by lighter ones .",
    "the attribution of the second knee as being due to the onset of @xmath106 decay therefore receives further strong support by the sudden lowering in the mean atomic mass number of cosmic rays that occurs beginning with the energy of the second knee also seen in the taiga data.@xcite applying eq .",
    "1 with the proton mass replaced by that of an alpha particle , one can express the predicted threshold energy for @xmath106 beta decay in terms of the tachyonic neutrino mass @xmath22 and equate it to the observed energy of the second knee :    @xmath110    where the @xmath111 uncertainty in the knee position is inferred from the graph in ref.@xcite . solving eq .",
    "8 we find that @xmath112      a sixth and final observation comes from an experiment looking for @xmath113 , a very rare process requiring @xmath3 to be a majorana particle .",
    "recently , solutions of the tachyonic dirac equation , originally proposed by chodos , hauser and kostelecky@xcite , have been studied in the helicity basis , by jentschura and wundt leading to a consistent description of a tachyonic spin 1/2 dirac field.@xcite chang has also worked with a tachyonic form of the dirac equation , and shown that majorana solutions can be constructed.@xcite thus , both dirac and majorana solutions are possible for tachyonic neutrinos . according to the standard theoretical mechanism involving the exchange of a light exchanged majorana neutrino ,",
    "the effective mass of the @xmath3 in @xmath113 can be inferred from the observed half - life of a decaying nucleus . moreover ,",
    "if cp is conserved and @xmath114 the effective mass of @xmath3 would be the same in double and single beta decay.@xcite the relationship between @xmath3 mass and half - life in @xmath113 is :    @xmath115    where g is the phase space available , @xmath116 is the electron mass and m is the nuclear matrix element.@xcite note however that by eq .",
    "9 the measured half - life is insensitive to the sign of @xmath117 the most sensitive experiment done as of 2001 reported merely an upper limit for @xmath118@xcite however , in later papers , with improved statistics and a different method of analysis , the heidelberg - moscow ( h - m ) collaboration published a series of papers reporting an actual value rather than simply an upper limit.@xcite in 2006 , after 13 years of data - taking for the decay of @xmath119 they reported a @xmath120 signal , with a half - life corresponding to @xmath121@xcite this result has been challenged because of questions whether this rare nuclear process was in fact observed above background .",
    "in fact , the gerda experiment,@xcite and two others looking for @xmath113 using @xmath122@xcite have recently also reported negative results at a level of sensitivity that is claimed to contradict the h - m 2006 positive result . however , the h - m authors have disputed the fact of a contradiction based on considerations involving energy resolution and insufficient statistics in the negative results .",
    "the gerda and h - m groups have written  dueling \" letters to the cern courier explaining why their result is the correct one.@xcite of course , a resolution of the @xmath123 controversy in favor of the negative results would not be fatal to our hypothesis , since tachyonic neutrinos need not be majorana fermions .",
    "we have discussed six observations which are each consistent with the hypothesis that @xmath3 is a tachyon having a mass @xmath124 two of the observations ( b and c ) rely on fits to the same cmb and lensing data , and they represent different interpretations of that data depending on whether sterile neutrinos exist ( c ) or not(b ) .",
    "it may be tempting to dismiss the six observations as a random list of unrelated items , but they all would follow directly from the existence of a tachyonic @xmath3 and they all suggest the same mass  one that is consistent with what was originally proposed in 1999,@xcite and given further support in a second publication that year.@xcite it may also be true that each observation taken individually has a more mundane explanation , but it should be noted that there are no known unobserved phenomena that should have been observed assuming the claim to be correct , as for example was the case for the original opera result , as noted by cohen and glashow.@xcite    is it possible that the observations yield tachyonic masses due to common systematic errors in the data from which they were derived , as probably was the case in tritium decay experiments , 13 out of 14 of which have yielded @xmath125 best fit values?@xcite the systematic errors involved in most of the six observations , however , are of a completely different character from one another , i.e. , there is no reason to believe that possible systematic errors involved with finding non - uniformities in the cosmic background radiation have anything whatsoever to do with systematic errors in looking for @xmath1 double beta decay , or those in a cosmic ray experiment .",
    "thus , the possibility of common systematic errors accounting for the six observations yielding a tachyonic mass for @xmath126 let alone the @xmath127 mass does not appear to be realistic .",
    "corroboration or refutation of the claim of this paper could come in a variety of ways , but a direct measurement of a superluminal speed is of course not one of them . a time - of - flight experiment to measure",
    "the excess above light speed for a @xmath3 with @xmath128 is out of the question , given the energy thresholds of neutrino detectors .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath129 one finds @xmath130 so that over a 600 km distance , @xmath3 would outrace a photon by an immeasurable @xmath131 there are , however , more promising tests that could test the claim that @xmath132 including three listed below .    1",
    ".   @xmath133 + even without any well - established sources of pev cosmic rays , one could look for excess numbers of cosmic rays in specific small regions of the sky for e near @xmath134 as suggested by the results in ref .  @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray researchers should also examine data in the pev range within several degrees of cygnus x-3 . in the 1999 paper@xcite making this claim a peak was seen in an energy histogram for events in a narrow ( @xmath135 ) phase window associated with the source s @xmath136 period , using as background the counts in the remaining @xmath137 this made for an ideal choice of background in a null test if cygnus is not a source .",
    "in fact , the @xmath138 excess above background found was a @xmath15 peak centered on @xmath139 this claim has been viewed skeptically because of an earlier negative search result for signals from cygnus x-3 in a very high statistics experiment .",

    "equally important , the phase of each event needs to be calculated using a highly accurate ephemeris .",
    "for example , suppose one had 10 y worth of data , i.e. , @xmath143 cygnus x-3 periods .",
    "in that case , the ( time varying ! ) period for cygnus x-3 would need to have an uncertainty less than @xmath144 in order to see a sharp phase peak in a phase histogram .",
    "the 1999 claim of a 4.5 pev neutron peak from cygnus x-3 appears never to have been tested based on a citation search .",
    "moreover , of the three tests proposed here , only this one could be made in a relatively short time using archived data .",
    "it would be especially useful to look for a @xmath140 peak in cosmic rays from cygnus x-3 in an experiment where the hadronic nature of neutral particles possibly from that source could be established,@xcite and/or during times when major flares occur , when radio emissions have been observed to increase a thousandfold .",
