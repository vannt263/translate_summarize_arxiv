    "the pump laser was free - running , and we observed a drift of the opo spectra on a time scale of the order of minutes .",
    "this resulted in baseline drifts in the measured absorption spectra .",
    "one improvement would be to lock the pump laser to an external frequency reference .",
    "the opo output would then be stabilized due to the self phase - locking mechanism of degenerate opos @xcite .",
    "by using synchronously pumped opos operating around degeneracy , we obtain ultra - broadband mid - ir radiation suitable for coherent spectroscopy in the fourier domain . a large instantaneous bandwidth of up to 800 @xmath1 allows detection of several trace gases simultaneously .",
    "spectroscopic detection of six molecules in trace amounts has been performed in the wavelength range of @xmath114 @xmath0 m . by injecting the gases inside the opo cavities we obtained substantial enhancement of the effective path length and achieved detection limits down to part - per - billion level in volume .",
    "our intracavity sensing approach offers great simplicity and compactness , which might be a great asset for future applications .",
    "the dispersive spectral features that we observe at some circumstances are well reproduced using a simple model for propagation in a dispersive fabry - perot cavity .",
    "these features can be predicted a priori from knowledge of dispersion of the intracavity elements ; on the other hand , if the dispersion of the individual components is not known , the overall dispersion can be precisely mapped by injecting trace amounts of known molecules and analyzing the shapes of spectral peaks . by decreasing the opo loss and increasing the finesse of the opo cavity we expect an improvement of detection limits , down to sub - ppb levels .",
    "this will also require better dispersion compensation , e.g. using chirped dielectric mirrors .",
    "utilizing intracavity cells with low ( @xmath310.1 atm . )",
    "gas pressure will allow better specificity of molecular recognition because of sharper spectral features .",
    "with further development , this system may find important applications in trace gas detection and real time human breath analysis  with further enhancement possible through the use of dual - comb multi - heterodyne methods .",
