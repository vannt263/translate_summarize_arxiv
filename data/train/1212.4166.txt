    "the rare leptonic decay of the @xmath7 into a dimuon pair , @xmath8 , is an example of a flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process .",
    "studies of such decay processes not only play an important role in determining electroweak and strong interaction parameters of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , but also serve as sensitive probes of possible physics beyond the standard model  @xcite . while recent evidence for observation of @xmath0 from lhc - b collaboration  @xcite , as well as an earlier result from cdf  @xcite preclude any spectacular new physics ( np ) effect , there is still room for np to influence this decay .",
    "it is then important to have a firm evaluation of @xmath9 in the sm   @xcite and a firm understanding that experimentally - observed branching ratio @xmath10 actually corresponds to the @xmath0 transition .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath0 decay is helicity suppressed in the sm by @xmath11 due to the left handed nature of weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "this effect arises from the necessary spin flip on the outgoing back - to - back lepton pair in order to conserve angular momentum since the initial state meson is spinless .",
    "this suppression is absent in @xmath7 decays where the muon pair is produced with one or more additional particles in the final state that can carry away a unit of angular momentum , such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "this means that , in general , those processes could have sizable total branching ratios , comparable to that of @xmath0 , despite being suppressed by other small parameters ( such as @xmath14 for @xmath12 )  @xcite . if , in addition , the final state photon or @xmath5 is undetected , while the invariant mass of @xmath15 pair is close to @xmath16 , then the experimentally - measured branching ratio would correspond to @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is an undetected particle or a group of particles .",
    "the contribution of @xmath18 would depend on how well @xmath6 could be detected in a particular experiment , as well as on whether @xmath18 has any kind of resonance enhancement that is not well modeled by background models chosen by a particular experiment in a given window of @xmath19 , as well as the size of that window .",
    "for example , for @xmath20 , most current searches use di - lepton energy cuts that would correspond to an allowable soft photon of up to 60 mev . for @xmath21",
    "transition and @xmath20 similar effects were discussed in  @xcite , and for @xmath6 being light particles  in @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall concentrate on the amplitudes that are non - vanishing in the @xmath22 limit .",
    "due to higher backgrounds in hadron collider experiments soft photons emitted in @xmath24 could be hard to detect , so this background could be quite important .",
    "this decays were previously analyzed in  @xcite , where a form - factor model - dependent calculation was performed  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite was mainly geared towards kinematical regimes where the photon is sufficiently hard to be detected ; in fact , low - energy cut - offs were introduced on photon energies .",
    "we apply a model - independent approach that incorporates both heavy quark symmetry for hadrons containing a heavy quark with mass @xmath25 , and chiral @xmath26 symmetries in the @xmath27 limit  @xcite .",
    "we organize our calculations in terms of an expansion in @xmath28 and examine the contribution of terms up to leading order in @xmath29 .",
    "similarly to @xmath30  @xcite , the decay amplitude for @xmath31 transition can be broken into two generic parts containing internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) and structure dependent ( sd ) contributions .",
    "the bremsstrahlung contributions are still helicity suppressed , while the sd contribution contain the electromagnetic coupling @xmath32 but are not suppressed by the lepton mass .",
    "phenomenologically , the origin of that can be understood as follows .",
    "when the soft photon in emitted from the @xmath33 meson , heavy intermediate states including the @xmath34 @xmath35 vector meson state become possible .",
    "this lifts helicity suppression since the lepton pair couples directly to the spin 1 meson . in the kinematic regime where the photon is soft",
    ", we expect that the significant contribution comes only from the vector @xmath35 resonance for reasons analogous to the @xmath36 pole dominance in @xmath37 at near zero pionic recoil energies  @xcite .",
    "this is because in the large @xmath38 limit the @xmath35 and @xmath33 become degenerate and the residual mass splitting is @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "therefore the excitation of the @xmath35 does not require much energy .",
