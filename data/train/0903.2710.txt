    "the recent preparation of cold ensembles of homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules in the electronic and vibrational ground state @xcite has opened the door to a new chapter in the theoretical and experimental study of trapped quantum degenerate gases @xcite .",
    "heteronuclear molecules , in particular , have large electric dipole moments associated with rotational excitations , and the new aspect in quantum gases of cold polar molecules is thus the large , anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions between the molecules which can be manipulated via external dc and ac fields in the microwave regime  @xcite . in combination with",
    "reduced trapping geometries , this promises the realization of novel quantum phases and quantum phase transitions , for example in the case of bosons the transition from a dipolar superfluid to a crystalline regime  @xcite .",
    "the theory of dipolar quantum gases , and various aspects of strongly correlated systems of polar molecules has been recently reviewed by baranov  @xcite and by pupillo et al .",
    "@xcite    below we will extend these theoretical studies to _ mixtures of atomic and dipolar molecular quantum gases_. more specifically , we will be interested in a situation where polar molecules form a self - assembled dipolar lattice , in which atoms can move and scatter .",
    "this scenario leads to a new physical realization of a hubbard model where atoms see the periodic structure provided by the crystal formed by the polar molecules .",
    "in contrast to the familiar case of the realization of hubbard models with cold atoms in optical lattices , where standing laser light waves produce a _ fixed _ periodic external lattice potential , self - assembled dipolar lattices have their own lattice dynamics represented by phonons .",
    "thus atoms moving in dipolar crystals give rise to hubbard models which include both ( i ) atom - phonon couplings , and ( ii ) atom - atom interactions .",
    "this extends the notion of quantum simulation of strongly correlated systems with cold atoms to include phonon - dynamics , where both the atomic and phonon coupling parameters can be controlled by external fields .",
    "we note that atom - molecule mixtures arise naturally in photoassociation experiments , where a two - species atomic quantum degenerate gas is _ partially _ transferred to ground state molecules via formation of highlying feshbach molecules , followed by a raman transfer to the ground state .",
    "similar hubbard models result also in mixtures of two unbalanced species of polar molecules , where the first molecular species forms a crystal while the second species provides the extra particles hopping in the self - assembled dipolar lattice .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the dynamics of atoms and molecules embedded in dipolar crystals is conveniently described by a _",
    "polaronic _ picture where the particles are dressed by the crystal phonons .",
    "standard treatments of polaron dynamics show a competition between coherent and incoherent hopping of a particle in the lattice .",
    "the former corresponds to tunneling of a particle from one site to to the next , while carrying the lattice distortion , without changing the phonon occupation .",
    "the latter corresponds to _ thermally activated _ particle hopping , related to incoherent hopping events where the number of phonons changes in the hop .",

    "we extend our work  @xcite by re - deriving the results of  @xcite in the master equation context , and calculating additional corrections to the coherent and incoherent time evolution for our atomic and molecular mixtures .",
    "since we find that in the latter the polaron dynamics is typically slow compared to the characteristic time evolution of the bath , we specialize to the brownian motion limit of the master equation  @xcite .",
    "we show that for the models of interest and low - enough temperatures , corrections to the coherent time evolution of the polaron system are small , and thus the dynamics of the dressed particles is well described by an effective extended hubbard model in a wide range of realistic parameters .",
