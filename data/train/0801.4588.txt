    "the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) , in which the hall conductance ( hc ) @xmath2 is quantized with extremely high accuracy , is a typical realization of topological effects in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the topological aspect of the qhe with a periodic potential was first discussed by thouless , kohmoto , nightingale , and den nijs @xcite . in their work , the hc",
    "is given by the chern number @xcite over the magnetic brillouin zone , which is a topological expression by the bulk state .",
    "later hatsugai @xcite suggested that the hc can be given by another topological quantity , i.e. , the winding number  of the edge states on the complex - energy surface which is generally a high - genus riemann surface . to distinguish them ,",
    "we call the former the bulk theory  and the latter the edge theory .",
    "the two topological expressions for the hc , which look quite different , actually give the same integer number .",
    "a recent established recognition points out that the conventional qhe originates from the non - local effect provided by the external magnetic field , more exactly speaking , by the vector potential that describes the magnetic field .",
    "that means a non - zero vector potential , for example , which can be provided by spin - orbit interaction or by spin chirality , will induce the qhe even if the external magnetic field vanishes .",
    "this type of qhe can be called the anomalous qhe  @xcite .",
    "since haldane performed the famous haldane model  in his pioneering work @xcite in 1988 , the anomalous qhe in spin - orbit coupled @xcite or spin - chiral ferromagnetic systems @xcite has been a hot topic in condensed matter physics .",
    "based on the tight - binding two - dimenisonal ( 2d ) graphite model @xcite , haldane model includes the next - nearest neighboring interaction and a periodic local magnetic - flux density , which breaks time - reversal invariance and creates a chirality .",
    "however , because the introduction of local flux is technically difficult , it is not so easy to realize haldane model in real materials .",
    "another typical spin - chiral system is the ferromagnetic system , which is represented by pyrochlore compounds @xmath3mo@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath6=nd , sm , gd ) , in which the spin configuration is noncoplanar and the spin chirality appears .",
    "ohgushi et al .",
    "@xcite have first pointed out that the chiral spin state can be realized by the introduction of spin anisotropy in an _ ordered _ spin system on the 2d kagom lattice , which is the cross section of the pyrochlore lattice perpendicular to the @xmath7 direction @xcite . in this case , it has been shown in the topological bulk theory @xcite that the presence of chiral spin state may induce gauge - invariant nonzero chern number , thus resulting in a qhe in insulating state . however , as stressed by halperin @xcite , this gauge invariance has a relation with the edge states which are localized near the sample boundaries .",
    "recently we reinvestigated the kagom lattice with boundaries . using the topological edge theory established by hatsugai in the last decade @xcite , we interpreted the quantized hall conductance ( qhc ) in insulating state with the winding number of the edge states on the complex - energy surface @xcite .    in the above - mentioned theoretical works @xcite on the 2d kagom lattice",
    ", a very important limit has been used .",
    "that is the hopping electron spins are aligned with localized spins at each site of the lattices , which is also called the infinite ( _ strong _ ) hund s coupling limit .",
    "however , the latest detailed experiments on the pyrochlores @xcite showed that the spin - chiral mechanism _ alone _ can not explain the anomalous transport phenomena in these systems .",
    "so in this paper we study the 2d kagom lattice with boundaries in a general hund s coupling region , especially in the weak coupling region @xcite .",
    "we find that the edge states and qhc are not only affected by the spin chirality , but also affected by the strength of the hund s coupling .",
    "varying the spin chirality and the strength of the hund s coupling , two different types of phenomena are obtained . in one case that the strength of the hund s coupling is larger than its critical value ( see @xcite or sec .",
    "iii ) , there are only two edge - state energies in each bulk energy gap . with the help of the topological edge theory , we obtain that the corresponding hc is quantized as @xmath8=@xmath9 in insulating state .",
    "however , in another case that the hund s coupling strength is smaller than its critical value , there are _ possibly _ four edge - state energies in some one bulk gap . in this case , within the topological edge theory , we obtain that the corresponding hc is quantized as @xmath10=@xmath11 in this insulating state , which can not occur in the strong hund s coupling case .",
    "we also make a comparison between these results and those in the bulk theory @xcite , and find that they keep consistent with each other .",
    "this paper is organized as the following . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the tight - binding model of the 2d kagom lattice with boundaries along the @xmath1 direction and obtain the eigenvalue equations for sites .",
    "we also write out the hamiltonian of the 2d kagom lattice without boundaries in the reciprocal space in this section . because the analytical derivation is very difficult , then in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically calculate the energy spectrum . using the characters of the edge - state energies in the spectrum , we study the qhe within the topological edge theory . as comparison , we also recalculate the hc in the infinite system in this section .",
    "finally we make a conclusion in the last section .",
    "we consider the double - exchange ferromagnet kagom lattice schematically shown in fig .",
    "the triangle is one face of the tetrahedron . here",
    "we consider a pure spin model with anisotropic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions on a kagom lattice .",
    "it consists of an umbrella of three spins per unit cell of the kagom lattice .",
    "each umbrella can be described by the spherical coordinates of the three spins ( @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath13 ) , and ( @xmath14 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the angle @xmath15 ranges from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the tight - binding model of the 2d kagom system can be written as the following @xcite@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the hopping integral between two neighboring sites @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of an electron with spin @xmath24 on the site @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath25 is the effective coupling constant to each local moment @xmath26 , and these moments are treated below as classical variables .",
    "@xmath27 is a unit vector collinear with the local moment @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath28 are the pauli matrices . in the following we change notation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 labels the kagom unit cell and @xmath31 denote the sites a , b and c in this cell .",

    "now we suppose that the system is periodic in the @xmath0 direction but has two edges in the @xmath1 direction ( see fig .",
