    "red clump ( rc ) stars are core helium - burning giants .",
    "they form a prominent feature in the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of open clusters . following the prediction of @xcite ,",
    "it is known that they are abundant in the solar neighbourhood . in recent years",
    "much work has been devoted to studying the suitability of rc stars as a distance indicator .",
    "their absolute magnitudes in the optical range lie from @xmath4 mag for those of spectral type g8 iii to @xmath5 mag for type k2 iii @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitude of these stars in the @xmath6 band is @xmath7 mag with negligible dependence on metallicity @xcite , but with real dispersion .",
    "based on observations of 14 open clusters with @xmath8\\leq0 $ ] dex and @xmath9 gyr , @xcite found that for rc stars in clusters have @xmath10 mag .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath11-band magnitude of rc stars on the metallicity and age was extensively studied in the past from an observational point of view . in the most cases",
    "the @xmath11 band - mean absolute magnitude is insensitive to age and metallicity .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath12 of rc stars weakly depends on metallicity . @xcite and @xcite found little or no variation in @xmath12 with colour and metallicity .",
    "@xcite presented observations of eight open clusters , concluding that @xmath12 is less sensitive to metal abundance than @xmath0 , but that the dependence on age and metallicity is still not negligible . @xcite and @xcite confirmed the results of @xcite , and theoretical models from @xcite also show a dependence in @xmath11-band , predicting that an older cluster with higher metallicity has fainter rc stars .",
    "based on the model of @xcite , @xcite stated that @xmath13 is a complicated function of metallicity and age . for age @xmath14 gyr",
    ", it decreases with increasing metallicity , the opposite behaviour with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath12 absolute magnitudes .",
    "@xcite have also investigated the dependence of the mean @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath11 absolute magnitudes of the rc stars on metallicity and age , as a part of their ongoing araucaria project to improve stellar distance indicators .",
    "they took deep near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath16 and @xmath15 images of several fields in lmc , smc , and the carina , and fornax dwarf galaxies and made a comparison between the extinction -corrected @xmath15-band rc star magnitudes and some other stellar indicators , particularly the tip of the red giant -branch magnitude , the mean rr lyrae star @xmath17-band magnitude , and the mean @xmath15-band magnitude of cepheid variables at a period of 10 days .",
    "this comparison strongly suggests that absolute @xmath15-band magnitude of the rc stars have a very weak dependence , ( if any ) on @xmath18 $ ] over the broad range of metallicities covered by their target galaxies .",
    "they conclude that the mean @xmath15-band magnitude of the rc stars is an excellent distance indicator with small ( if any ) population corrections over a wide range in metallicity and age .",
    "@xcite stated that population effects strongly affect both @xmath17 -and @xmath11- band magnitude of rc stars in a complicated way .",
    "therefore , optical @xmath19 photometry of rc stars is not an accurate method for the determination of distances in nearby galaxies , while nir photometry is a much better way to measure distances with rc stars given its smaller sensitivity to population effects .",
    "@xcite determined the mean @xmath2 absolute magnitude for rc stars in the solar neighbourhood to within 2 per cent ( @xmath20 mag ) and applied their results to the estimation of the distance of lmc .",
    "a mean value for the @xmath2 absolute magnitude with weak dependence on metallicity makes it possible to use this population as a tracer of galactic structure and interstellar extinction , as several works have fully demonstrated in the last decade ( see for example * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) infrared data for a sample of 24 open clusters to investigate how the @xmath6-band absolute magnitude of the red clump depends on age and metallicity .",
    "they showed that a constant value of @xmath21 mag is a reasonable assumption to use in distance determinations of clusters with metallicity between -0.5 and + 0.4 dex and age between 0.31 and 7.94 gyr .",
    "the constant absolute magnitude value of rc stars was also supported with the newly reduced _ hipparcos _",
    "data by @xcite ( @xmath22 mag ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will contribute to the discussion by a different approach .",
    "we aim to calibrate the absolute magnitudes of rc stars in four bands , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath6 and @xmath23 , as a function of colour with field stars taken from different photometric surveys .",
    "the data are given in section 2 .",
    "the location of the rc stars in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram are demonstrated in section 3 .",
    "the luminosity - colour relations in optical and near - infrared are given in sections 4 .",
    "we tested the absolute magnitudes derived by the procedure in our study in section 5 , and a summary and conclusion is presented in section 6 .",
    "we used three sets of data .",
    "the @xmath24 data were taken from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite which also provides trigonometric parallaxes . in order to obtain reliable absolute magnitude and distances , only the stars with relative parallax error ( @xmath25 ) is less than or equals to 0.1 are selected .",
    "thus , 32 144 stars are included into the sample with @xmath24 magnitudes .",
    "the second set of data consists of @xmath26 magnitudes . within this sample",
    "only 32 072 stars were detected in the 2mass catalogue @xcite .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ stars were not observed in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath27 magnitudes of the sample stars were evaluated by the transformation equations of @xcite .",
    "thus , the resulting catalogue consisted of three different photometries , i.e. johnson - cousins ( @xmath24 ) , 2mass ( @xmath26 ) , and sdss ( @xmath27 ) of all the rc stars within the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the observed trigonometric parallaxes are biased because the volume of space per unit of parallax is not constant .",
    "the pioneers of this topic are @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite were the first who quantified the bias .",
    "other studies followed the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed that @xcite s methodology seemed to be that of bayesian statistics .",
    "the luzt - kelker ( lk ) bias can be explained as follows .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the parallax and its error of a star .",
    "then , one can define a distance @xmath30 with lower and upper limits , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "stars in a given volume can scatter to the distance @xmath30 . since the number of stars in the distance interval ( @xmath30 , @xmath32 ] are more than the ones in the distance interval [ @xmath31 , @xmath30 ] , more stars from the interval ( @xmath30 , @xmath32 ] will scatter to distance @xmath30 than the ones in [ @xmath31 , @xmath30 ] .",
    "the result of this effect is that measured parallaxes cause smaller distance estimations .",
    "we used the following equation of @xcite to correct the observed _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite ,    @xmath35    where @xmath28 and @xmath36 are the observed and corrected parallaxes , respectively , and @xmath29 denotes the error of the observed parallax . according to @xcite relative parallax errors , @xmath25 , larger than 0.17 are not reliable .",
    "the @xmath37 colour excess of stars have been evaluated in two steps .",
    "first , we used the maps of @xcite and evaluated a @xmath38 colour excess for each star .",
    "then , we reduced them using the following procedure @xcite : @xmath39.\\ ] ] here , @xmath40 and @xmath30 are the galactic latitude and distance to the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the scale height for the interstellar dust which is adopted as 125 pc @xcite . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the total absorptions for the model and for the distance to the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 can be evaluated by means of the following equation :    @xmath44    @xmath38 is the colour excess for the model taken from the @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath45 , i.e. the colour excess for the corresponding star at the distance @xmath30 , can be evaluated via equation ,    @xmath46    we have omitted the indices @xmath47 and @xmath30 from the colour excess @xmath37 in the equations .",
    "however , we use the terms `` model '' for the colour excess of @xcite and `` reduced '' for the colour excess corresponding to distance @xmath30 . the total absorption @xmath48 used in the section and classical total absorption @xmath49 have the same meaning .",
