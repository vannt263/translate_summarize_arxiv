    "phonons are quanta of sound and are very important concept in condensed matter physics .",
    "they exist as vibrating modes in various physical systems , including single trapped ions  @xcite , atoms in solid - state materials  @xcite , and macroscopic mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "phonons are very similar to photons in the sense that both are bosonic particles and obey bose - einstein statistics .",
    "thus , the phenomena occurred in photons are quite often brought to phonons .",
    "for instance , in analogue to coherent and squeezed photon states , squeezed phonon states  @xcite have been proposed to be generated in bulk solid - state materials by using second - order raman scattering and explored to modulate quantum fluctuations of atomic displacements .",
    "the coherent phonon generation via impulsive stimulated raman scattering in the condensed media  @xcite and the phonon stimulated emission have also been studied  @xcite .    reaching",
    "the quantum mechanical regime for vibrating modes of macroscopic mechanical resonators is a longstanding goal  @xcite .",
    "both mechanical resonators and single - mode cavity fields can be modeled as harmonic oscillators .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that mechanical resonators can play the role of single - mode cavities in quantum optics , and help to realize mechanical quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) by replacing the single - mode cavity field with a mechanical resonator in its quantum regime .",
    "experimentalists have showed that the usual jaynes - cumming model in the cavity qed can be realized by coupling a superconducting qubit to a mechanical resonator  @xcite . also several methods have been developed in optomechanical systems for cooling the mechanical resonators with low frequencies to their quantum ground states by coupling them to single - mode microwave or optical fields via the radiation pressure  @xcite .",
    "these achievements lay a solid foundation to develop single - mode phonon cavity  @xcite and manipulate phonon states  @xcite at single - photon level  @xcite using mechanical resonators .",
    "it well known that lasing can be generated when the stimulated emission is coherently amplified by a gain medium inside a cavity .",
    "similar to the lasing , several theoretical proposals were put forward to generate phonon coherent amplification of stimulated emission in different systems , e.g. , the quantum dot  @xcite , ultra - cold atomic gas  @xcite , nanomagnets  @xcite , acoustical cavities  @xcite , and double barrier systems  @xcite .",
    "the amplification of mechanical oscillations was also theoretically studied by coupling a nanomechanical resonator to polarized paramagnetic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "such so - called phonon lasing was experimentally demonstrated in the systems of vibrating microscopic particles ( e.g.,trapped magnesium ions  @xcite ) , electromechanical resonator  @xcite , and superlattice structures  @xcite .",
    "recently reported several experiments on phonon lasing in optomechanical systems  @xcite and also in an optomechanical system coupled to a cavity  @xcite are of particular interest , and have been focus of attention .    in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , two degenerate microtoroid whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) optical resonators are coupled in a controllable way through the evanescent fields , and one of them is coupled to a mechanical resonator via radiation pressure .",
    "these two coupled optical cavities form two supermodes acting as a controllable two - level system which can be tuned to resonantly interact with the mechanical resonator .",
    "this ingenious design is very similar to the laser system with two - level atoms interacting with single - mode cavity fields  @xcite . although the threshold condition on phonon lasing in the coupled cavity system has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stability of the system , lasing phonon statistics and the threshold still need to be rigorously analyzed .",
    "motivated by the experiment on phonon lasing  @xcite and considering both theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies on the coupled optomechanical systems from optical to microwave frequencies  @xcite , we have analyzed phonon lasing in coupled optomechanical systems by using a completely quantum theoretical approach .     and @xmath0 of the left and right cavity .",
