    "d    istributed space - time coding has been a powerful technique for achieving spatial diversity in wireless networks with single antenna terminals . an excellent introduction to cooperative communications based on distributed space - time coding in two - hop wireless networks",
    "can be seen in @xcite and the references within .",
    "the technique involves a two phase protocol where , in the first phase , the source broadcasts the information to the relays and in the second phase , the relays linearly process the signals received from the source and forward them to the destination such that the signal at the destination appears as a space - time block code ( stbc ) .",
    "such stbcs , generated distributively by the relay nodes , are called distributed space - time block codes ( dstbcs ) .    in a co - located multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) channel , an stbc is said to be single - symbol maximum likelihood ( ml ) decodable ( ssd ) if the ml decoding metric splits as a sum of several terms , with each term being a function of only one of the information symbols @xcite . since",
    "the work of @xcite , considerable efforts have been made to design ssd dstbcs .",
    "a dstbc is said to be ssd if the stbc seen by the destination from the set of relays is ssd .",
    "dstbcs with single - symbol ml decodability was first introduced for cooperative networks in @xcite .",
    "further , in @xcite , high - rate , ssd dstbcs have been proposed wherein the source performs linear precoding of information symbols before transmitting it to all the relays . for the class of codes proposed in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the channel model is such that each relay is assumed to know only the statistics of the channel from the source to itself ( but not their realizations ) . in @xcite and @xcite , ssd dstbcs",
    "are proposed for the case where every relay node is assumed to have the perfect knowledge of the phase component of the channel from the source to the relay .",
    "an upper bound on the symbol rate for such a set up is shown to be @xmath1 ( in complex symbols per channel use in the second phase ) which is independent of the number of relays . however , these codes have exponential decoding delay whereas the codes in @xcite and @xcite are of minimal delay",
    ". moreover , in the model considered in @xcite and @xcite , training sequences have to be transmitted from the source to the relays since each relay needs to know the phase component of the channel from the source to itself .",
    "therefore , the source needs to use some of the resources such as power and bandwidth for transmitting the training sequences . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the number of channel uses spent on transmitting training signals are not accounted in computing the rate of the dstbcs .    for point to point co - located mimo channels , complex orthogonal designs ( cods ) @xcite ,",
    "coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs ( ciods ) @xcite and clifford unitary weight designs ( cuwds ) @xcite are well known for their ssd property when used to generate stbcs .",
    "note that , with the assumption of the knowledge of the phase component of the source - relay channel at the relays , all cods can be constructed as dstbcs @xcite .",
    "the extensions of cods such as ciods and cuwds can also be distributively constructed .",
    "however , cods ( other than the alamouti design ) , ciods and cuwds ( other than that for 4 antennas ) do not retain the ssd property .    in this paper , we propose high rate , training embedded ssd dstbcs .",
    "the proposed codes include the training symbols in the structure of the code which is shown to be the key point to obtain high rate as well as the ssd property . on the similar lines of the work in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the relay nodes are assumed to have the knowledge of the phase component of the channel from the source to itself . in this paper ,",
    "the number of channel uses spent on transmitting training signals from the source to the relays are accounted in computing the rate of the proposed dstbcs .",
    "the main contributions of this paper and the organization can be summarized as follows :    * we propose a novel method to construct high rate ( in symbols per channel use ) , ssd dstbcs for two - hop wireless relay networks based on the amplify and forward protocol .",
    "the proposed method has an in - built training scheme for the relays to learn the phase components of their backward channels .",
    "the in - built training symbols is shown to be the key point to obtain high rate as well as the ssd property ( section [ sec2 ] ) . * when all the zero entries of a cod ( square or non - square ) are replaced by a constant , the resulting design is called a training - embedded - cod ( te - cod ) .",
    "these are shown to generate ssd dstbcs .",
    "this essentially enables all cods to be usable as ssd dstbcs with full - diversity for arbitrary complex constellations .",
    "compared to the existing ssd codes of @xcite ( where the number of channel uses spent in sending the training symbols are not included in calculating the rate of the dstbcs ) , the class of non - square te - cods are shown to provide higher rates for two - hop networks with number of relays less than @xmath2 ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "we highlight that the class of non - square te - cods provide higher rates than those in @xcite even though the number of channel uses spent in sending the training symbols are not included in calculating the rate of the schemes in @xcite . *",
    "simulation results for @xmath3 relays are presented which show that the proposed scheme performs better than the code presented in @xcite by 0.5 db ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",

    "the number of channel uses in the second phase is also @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the rate of this scheme is @xmath140 .",

    "also , from the results of theorem [ thm1 ] , for the class of te - cods , @xmath87 is a scaled identity matrix and hence the matrix @xmath144 is the same as @xmath145 .",
    "since @xmath4 is an te - cod , the matrix @xmath146 can be written as a sum of @xmath94 matrices where each matrix is strictly a function of only one of the real variables .",
    "for example , the matrix @xmath146 for the square te - cod for @xmath3 relays given in example [ example_2 ] , is given by ( at the top of the next page ) in which , since @xmath146 is a hermitian matrix , we only present the elements on and above the main diagonal elements of @xmath146 .",

    "hence , the ml decoding metric splits as a sum of several terms , with each term being a function of only one of the variables .",
    "thus , when te - cods are applied as te - dstbc , every variable can be decoded independent of the other complex variables .",
    "notice that when @xmath149 the matrix @xmath146 in becomes a scaled identity matrix corresponding to the well known cods .      from the results of @xcite ,",
    "a te - dstbc is fully diverse if for any two distinct codewords @xmath150 and @xmath151 of a te - dstbc , the matrix @xmath152 is full rank . since we employ a te - cod to generate the te - dstbc , the difference matrix @xmath153 gets a @xmath148 at the position where there is @xmath55 in the design and hence the matrix @xmath152 will be a diagonal one with full rank .",
    "thus , te - dstbc generated from te - cods have full diversity property for arbitrary signal sets .      in our proposed scheme , the total number of channel uses involving both the first phase and the second phase is @xmath154",

    "have been constructed with rate @xmath1 in complex symbols per channel use in the second phase .",
