    "spin casting of polymer films from solutions is an important practical process . the intrinsic state of these films after casting raises a number of questions -especially if they are thin @xcite . in most cases",
    ", we are dealing with materials such as polystyrene , or polymethyl metacrylate , which are glassy in the final state : these glassy features complicate the process enormously .    in the present pages ,",
    "we consider a simpler case :  a ) the dry polymer is assumed to remain fluid at room temperature ( for instance , it could be a silicone oil )  b ) the polymer is assumed not to adsorb on the free surface of the solutions ( this corresponds to @xmath1@xmath4 ) .",
    "we shall see that certain convective instabilities should occur during evaporation : one driven by concentration effects , and one driven by thermal effects ( benard marangoni ) .",
    "we find that the concentration effects should usually be more important .    in section 2 , we give a simple description of the classical evaporation process in a mixed film , associated with a diffusion flow of the solvent .",
    "many more precise discussions of this process exist in the literature @xcite , but the present crude picture is enough to estimate the concentration drop @xmath5 between the bottom plate ( @xmath6 ) and the upper free surface ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this drop is the essential control parameter for the onset of a convective instability ( section 3 ) .",
    "this instability requires low viscosities : indeed the films  are initially dilute and of low viscosity .",
    "we discuss the dilute limit in section 4 .",
    "ultimately , we discuss another possible source of instability related to thermal effects : evaporation cools the outer surface .",
    "this leads to a classical benard marangoni instability @xcite .",
    "we show in the appendix that , ( when @xmath8 ) , concentration effects should dominate over thermal effects .",
    "all our discussion is restricted to the level of scaling laws .",
    "this is not unreasonable : even without instabilities , the concentration profiles in the evaporation problem are quite complex , and depend on many details : an exact hydrodynamic calculation of the thresholds in this situation would be purely numerical , and not very informative .",
    "the volume fraction of solvent @xmath9 decreases when we move from the bottom plate ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) to the free surface ( @xmath12 ) .  at the free surface ,",
    "we assume instant equilibrium : the partial gas pressure of the solvent is equal to the equilibrium gas pressure @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath7 .  in practice",
    ", we shall be concerned mainly with dilute solutions and replace ( very roughly ) @xmath14 by the vapor pressure of pure solvent @xmath15 . above the free surface , the solvent molecules diffuse in air , with a certain diffusion coefficient @xmath16 .  in practice ,",
    "the air transport involves both diffusion and convection , dependent on various noise sources in the experimental room . as is often done , we assume that all this can be described as diffusion through a boundary layer of fixed thickness @xmath17 ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .",
    "the number density of solvent molecules in the gas @xmath20 thus drops linearly from the value associated to @xmath21 :    @xmath22    to 0 at the upper end ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the diffusion current in the film ( number of molecules per unit area and per second ) is :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cooperative diffusion coefficient of the solution @xcite , and we ignore the @xmath26 dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "the same flux is found  just above the free surface :    @xmath27    our scaling estimate for the diffusion constant of solvent in air is @xmath28v@xmath29 , where v@xmath30 is a thermal velocity for a solvent molecular , and @xmath31 is a mean free path , inversely proportional to the air pressure @xmath32 .",
    "this gives ultimately :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the size of a solvent molecule .    combining eqs([eq1]-[eq4 ] ) , we arrive at :    @xmath35    typically , taking  @xmath36  @xmath37  @xmath34v@xmath38  @xmath39 and @xmath40 : we obtain @xmath41 eq . ( [ eq5 ] ) is important , because it defines the driving force for the convective instability to be discussed in the next section .",
    "the principle is shown on fig.[fig1 ] . during the unperturbed evaporation process",
    ", we saw that there is a significant difference between the solvent fractions @xmath42 and @xmath7 ( down and up ) at the supporting surface and at the free surface .",
    "we now assume that a roll instability is superposed on the diffusion flux .",
    "we can visualise the system as a set of rolls of size @xmath43 , or as a set of plumes carrying extra solvent from down to up .",
    "the result is a slight difference in solvent concentration between point a ( @xmath44 ) and point b ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we estimate this difference by a balance between convection and diffusion :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the convective velocity .  the difference @xmath48 induces a gradient of surface tension :    @xmath49    where @xmath50=@xmath51 is assumed negative : the polymer has a higher surface tension than the solvent",
    ".    finally , we estimate @xmath47 by a balance between surface forces and viscous stresses :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the solution viscosity .    combining eqs ( [ eq6 ] , [ eq7 ] , @xmath54 ) one arrives at a minimal thickness :    @xmath55    for rough estimates , we can write in the semi dilute regime :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the thermal energy , @xmath58 the solvent viscosity , and @xmath59 the mesh size in the solution @xcite .    the result is :    @xmath60    we can now combine eq .

    "\\b ) role of the solution viscosity @xmath53 : if we were dealing with concentrated polymer films , @xmath64 would be very high , and @xmath62 would be prohibitively large .  for instance ,",
    "if we choose @xmath65  @xmath66  @xmath67  @xmath37  and @xmath68v@xmath69 we arrive at @xmath70 however , we must not forget that our films always start from a rather dilute state , with @xmath71 the instability will grow _ during the early stages of evaporation_. if we now switch to @xmath72 , we are led to @xmath73 nanometers . thus ( even if there are large numerical prefactors in eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) ) we expect to find the instability in films around 1 micron .",
    "\\c ) to substantiate this prediction , we must show that the evaporation time @xmath74 is longer than the growth time ( @xmath75 ) of the instability .",
    "we estimate @xmath76 as follows .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) :    @xmath78    using also eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , this gives an evaporation rate :    @xmath79    lest us now consider the growth time of the instability @xmath75 .  for simplicity , we shall focus our attention here on rather thin films , where inertial effects can be neglected .",
    "we can then rewrite a time dependent equation for the modulation @xmath80 in the form :    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the horizontal wave vector of the modulation ( @xmath83).we also have , as in eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) :    @xmath84    at threshold , the two terms in eq . ( [ eq15 ] )",
    "balance each other .",
    "we now consider situations definitively above threshold , where the convection term in ( 15 ) is dominant .  using eq .",
    "[ eq16 ] , this leads to :    @xmath85    comparing eqs ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) we find :    @xmath86    taking a dilute system , with @xmath87  @xmath88  @xmath66 we find @xmath89thus , the instability should grow easily before complete evaporation -during a time interval @xmath90 , where the viscosity is low and @xmath2 is small .",
    "another estimate  for @xmath75 , can be written down , when inertia is dominant ( and eq .",
    "[ eq16 ] is modified ) .",
    "but the conclusion remains the same for most practical film thicknesses .",
    "\\d ) there are a number of details which are not included in our discussion : for instance , the dependence of the surface tension @xmath91 on solvent concentration in the dilute limit ( @xmath92 ) has not been considered .",
    "in fact , we know that when the polymer surface tension is higher than the solvent surface tension , there is a depletion layer of thickness @xmath93 near the free surface , and the surface tension has the following scaling form @xcite :    @xmath94    thus , the parameter @xmath95 of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) is really @xmath26 dependent :    @xmath96    but , for reasonable values of @xmath7 ( e.g. @xmath97 ) this brings in only minor corrections on @xmath2 -proportional to ( 1-@xmath7)@xmath98",
    "all our discussion ignored numerical coefficients , and we know how they can be important ( e.g. for the onset of thermal convection in the rayleigh problem ) . but some conclusions do emerge :    \\1 ) the convective instability due to concentration gradients in the film should show up for non glassy polymer films ( of thickness @xmath99",
