    "because the theory of gravity describes the spacetime itself , quantization of gravity is conceptually more difficult than quantization of the other fundamental interactions .",
    "if , however , the basic quantum principles we are already familiar with apply as well to a quantum theory of gravity , we can make some predictions about expected quantum effects , even in the absence of a fundamental underlying theory . indeed ,",
    "if some such predictions can be tested , we may be able to derive useful constraints on the properties of the true underlying theory in which gravity is quantized .",
    "the basic question we pose here is whether data received from astrophysical systems emitting thermal radiation can provide tests of quantum gravity .",
    "one generic prediction is that the quantization of gravity should be associated with fluctuations of the spacetime metric .",
    "let the classical spacetime metric be represented by @xmath4 , and let the fluctuations be described by @xmath5 the full quantum metric , @xmath6 , is therefore the sum : @xmath7 .",
    "the fluctuations described by @xmath8 can be viewed as leading to fluctuations of the lightcone .",
    "lightcone fluctuations cause the arrival times of light signals to differ from what they would have been in the classical theory .",
    "the arrival times are not systematically earlier or later than those predicted classically , but are instead spread about the classical prediction in both directions .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "the functional form of the mean spread , @xmath9 , is determined by the functional form of @xmath8 . because increasing path length provides more opportunities for s to act",
    ", @xmath9 typically grows with increasing distance between the emitter and detector , but the rate of growth can also depend on the geometry and topology of the spacetime .",
    "= 5.6 in    a spread in arrival times introduces spectral changes .",
    "if , for example , the classical situation is that a perfect wave of one frequency is emitted by some source , lightcone fluctuations will introduce a spread in the arrival times of each peak . this spread is measured as a spread in the frequencies received from the source by a detector .",
    "spectral changes between the emitted and received spectrum of light can be expressed in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compute the form of the changes induced in a thermal spectrum and to consider the astrophysical circumstances under which these changes might be detectable .",
    "we focus on the application to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "our motivation for this application is twofold .",
    "first , deviations of the cmb from a pure thermal spectrum are well constrained ; second , the effect of any given metric fluctuation increases with distance , and the surface of last scattering is the most distant emitter of light . in ",
    "2 we start with a given @xmath9 and compute the form of the expected spectral deviations . in ",
    "3 we apply our results to the microwave background . in  4 we demonstrate how @xmath9 can be related to metric fluctuations and thus , how either measuring or placing limits on the size of @xmath9 can help to probe quantum fluctuations of the metric . in  5 we study the prospects that astrophysical measurements , including but not limited to measurements of the cmb , will allow us to place useful constraints in the foreseeable future .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether angular dependence due to metric fluctuations , provides another effect which can be used to test quantum gravity .",
    "this question is not central to the work we describe on the cocmic microwave background ( cmbr ) , since we are interested in the in the determination of its temperature , and not in the variation of temperature across the sky .",
    "nevertheless , angular effects could be useful in other applications .",
    "we therefore consider them in the appendix . we show that , in the quantum gravity theory we have considered , angular deviations are a higher order effect than lightcone fluctuations and can therefore be neglected . in other cases , however , an angular spread due to s could turn out to be important ; we therefore discuss the implications in  5.1 .",
    "a classical pulse of light will propagate through a distance @xmath10 in time @xmath11 where , in this last equality , we have introduced units with @xmath12 lightcone fluctuations cause propagation times to be either longer or shorter than @xmath10 by a mean deviation @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean square deviation in the geodesic interval function .",
    "the functional form of @xmath16 and the range of its expected values emerge from specific quantum theories . in general",
    ", @xmath17 is a function of the flight time @xmath10 .",
    "if the fluctuations were a random walk type of process , one could think of them as occuring in a sequence of steps , each of which is uncorrelated with the previous step . in this case",
    ", one would have @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , quantum metric fluctuations are not necessarily of this type , and detailed models can lead to other functional dependencies of @xmath9 upon @xmath10 .",
    "one class of models which can lead to large lightcone fluctuations are kaluza - klein type theories with compact extra dimensions .",
    "confining a quantum field into a region with a small compact spatial dimension leads to enhanced quantum fluctuations , as a consequence of the uncertainty principle .",
    "this issue , and the details of how @xmath17 is calculated will be discussed in more detail in  4 .",
    "another issue also discussed there is that of the correlation time , @xmath20 . the expected relative time delay or advance of a pair of pulses",
    "is only given by @xmath9 when the pulses are separated in time by an amount greater than @xmath20 , which one can regard as the characteristic time scale for the metric fluctuations .",
    "here we assume gaussian fluctuations and that @xmath9 is frequency independent .",
    "this is a natural choice , and corresponds to the achromaticity of gravitational effects in classical general relativity .",
    "the choices of frequency - independence and gaussianity are more specifically motivated by work ( ford 1995 ) showing that linear quantum metric fluctuations due to a bath of gravitons modifies the retarded green s function from a delta function on the forward lightcone into a gaussian function .",
    "in addition , the same behavior was found by yu and ford ( 1999 ) in models in which the metric fluctuations arise from compact extra dimensions . in both of these cases , the resulting @xmath9",
    "is found to be frequency - independent .",
    "thus , although the assumptions of frequency - dependence and gaussianity are not universally applicable , they do apply to important classes of theories and are likely to provide useful insights into the effects of lightcone fluctuations in other classes of quantum gravity theories .",
    "we further note that , although some quantum gravity theories do predict frequency dependent effects ( amelino - camelia _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , astronomical data is already beginning to place limits on such frequency - dependence .",
    "for example , observations of the crab pulsar rule out differential time delays greater than @xmath21 msec for energies above @xmath22 gev as compared with @xmath23 mev ( kaaret 1999 ) .",
    "study of a tev @xmath24-ray flare associated with the active galaxy markarian 421 indicates that there is no significant time delay between the emission at @xmath25 tev and the emission at @xmath22 tev ( biller _ et al .",
    "multiwavelength observations of @xmath24-ray bursts can place even stronger limits on the frequency - dependence of lightcone fluctuations if simultaneous observation of the arrival times from radio to @xmath24-ray energies can be made , and if the distance to the burst source can be determined ( schaefer 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore proceed with calculations incorporating the choices of frequency - independence and gaussianity , which simplify the calculations and also allow us to determine what functional forms for the frequency dependence can be most readily tested .",
    "a spread in flight times for pulses necessarily implies a spread in frequency .",
    "consider , for example , a source which emits a monchromatic wave .",
    "the individual wave crests may be regarded as being pulses whose times of arrival at a detector vary by about @xmath9 .",
    "this introduces a spread in frequency , @xmath26 .",
    "this means that we can look for signatures of lightcone fluctuations in the frequency domain rather than the time domain , which is likely to lead to more stingent constraints .",
    "even a staionary source such a blackbody emitter , which does not have any intrinsic time dependence , can have its frequency spectrum distorted by lightcone fluctuations .    when there are gaussian lightcone fluctuations , a monochromatic wave of frequency @xmath27 with @xmath28 the period , becomes a gaussian with width @xmath29 that is , @xmath30   { { 1}\\over{\\sqrt{\\pi } \\delta\\ , \\nu}}\\ ] ] thus , a spectrum described by a function @xmath31 , is distorted and will now be described by @xmath32 if the original spectrum was thermal , then @xmath33 and @xmath34.\\ ] ] it is convenient to evaluate this integral by introducing the variable @xmath35 defined so that @xmath36 @xmath37 can now be expressed as @xmath38 expanding to second order in @xmath0 we find that @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 may be written as follows : @xmath41)=\\bigg({{\\delta\\ , t}\\over{b}}\\bigg)^2",

    "it is useful to concentrate on its functional form , independent of the value of @xmath16 and of the temperature of the emitter .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath44 @xmath45 figure 2 displays the functional form of @xmath46 for @xmath47 as @xmath48 increases , @xmath49 continues to increase as @xmath50 thus , reliable measurements of a thermal spectrum that extend to high frequencies with small uncertainties have a good chance of detecting any deviations that may exist due to lightcone fluctuations . since , however , the spectrum is actually falling to zero as @xmath51 increases , high precision measurements may be more difficult .",
    "it is therefore instructive to consider @xmath52 which is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the term that must be added to the original spectrum in order to obtain the perturbed spectrum is simply @xmath53    the effects of s on the spectrum can be seen directly in figures 4 and 5 . in figure 4",
    ", @xmath54 was chosen to be @xmath55 note that , as the functional form of @xmath56 dictates , the flux is enhanced near and below the peak of the thermal spectrum , with a dip at intermediate frequencies , and then a second significant enhancement extending out to higher frequencies . had the value of @xmath54 been slightly larger , the flux near @xmath57 would have dipped below @xmath58 indicating that the second order approximation we made to derive a simple analytic form is no longer valid . in figure 5 , @xmath54 was chosen to be @xmath59 with this choice , the effects at low and intermediate frequency are just visible by eye on a plot linear in the flux , while the effects at higher frequencies can be clearly seen in a logarithmic plot .",
    "as @xmath54 decreases further , sensitive measurements are needed to discover definitive evidence of s. in figure 6 , the logarithm of the fractional deviation from a thermal spectrum ( expressed in parts per million ) is plotted as a function of @xmath60 each curve corresponds to a different value of @xmath61 .",
    "this plot illustrates the role high - precision measurements of a thermal spectrum can play in measuring or placing limits on the value of @xmath13    = 5.6 in    = 5.6 in    = 5.6 in    = 5.6 in    = 5.6 in",
    "the spectrum of the microwave background has been measured by the firas ( far infrared absolute spectraphotometer ) aboard the cobe ( cosmic background explorer ) over the range of wavelengths ( 480 - 4400 @xmath62 m [ @xmath63  @xmath64 ) .",
    "these measurements have constrained departures from a pure thermal spectrum at a level of a few parts in @xmath65 near the peak of the spectrum ( fixsen _ et al . _",

    "these measurements can be used to constrain the lightcone fluctuations .",
    "@xmath67 where values of d(x ) are on the order of @xmath65 near the peak of the spectrum .",
    "we have used two methods to derive limits on @xmath68 from the microwave data .",
    "first , we proceeded in exact analogy to the work carried out by fixsen _",
    "_ 1996 ; in that paper limits on comptonization and on a chemical potential were derived , based on fits to the cobe - measured spectrum . in  3.1 ,",
    "limits on the microwave background are put on the same footing , yielding the @xmath2 confidence limit @xmath69 . in ",
    "3.2 we take another approach , using a point - by - point analysis .",
    "this approach allows us to identify the points that provide the strongest constraints , and show that they produce a result consistent with the result derived by considering the full spectrum .",
    "such a point - wise analysis could be used for other thermal spectra .",
    "if , for example , measurements at only a limited number of points are possible , our approach illustrates which are the most useful points to sample .",
    "alternatively , the point - wise approach could strengthen the results based on the microwave data if one or two high - precision spectral measurements of the microwave background can be made at higher frequencies .      to derive limits for @xmath70",

    "the result of this fit is @xmath83 .",
    "physical measurements of @xmath84 should yield a non - negative result ; since , however , the negative result we have found is only at the level of @xmath85 it is likely to represent only statistical errors in the estimation of @xmath84 .",
    "we can then use the derived uncertainty of @xmath84 to place an upper limit on @xmath84 and hence on @xmath9 . for a 95% confidence limit",

    "since @xmath90 for @xmath91k , this translates to @xmath92  s. times the frequency we measure today , assuming a flat einstein - de sitter model .",
    "this is similar to the result we would have derived in other cosmological models .",

    "well - chosen frequencies \" , we mean frequencies at which the effects of lightcone fluctuations are maximized , as shown in figures 2 and 6 .",
    "we have demonstrated that astrophysical measurements can either measure or place constraints on the value of @xmath9 . in this section",
    "we demonstrate how such measurements or constraints can provide information about quantum fluctuations of the spacetime metric .    in a fixed , classical spacetime ,",
    "the flight time of a pulse traveling from a source to a detector is uniquely determined by the spacetime metric and by the path of the pulse .",
    "the flight time will generally differ from what might have been expected in a flat spacetime .",
    "an example from classical relativity is the time delay of radar signals passing near the limb of the sun , which has been used as a test of general relativity .",
    "the fact that the signals pass through a region with a schwarzschild metric leads to an increase in the flight time as compared to what would be expected in flat spacetime .",
    "if , however , the metric were to change , so would the flight time .",
    "gravity waves provide examples from classical relativity ; a laser interferometer gravity wave detector can be viewed as measuring variations in the path length , or equivalently flight time , in the arms of the interferometer as a gravity wave passes by .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the metric must also lead to fluctuations of the flight time . consider a quantum spacetime , represented by an ensemble of classical geometries .",
    "each member of this ensemble will have its own value for the flight time .",
    "the variance in flight time obtained when we average over the ensemble is the quantity @xmath9 .",
    "let us suppose that the average spacetime metric is that of minkowski spacetime .",
    "further let @xmath10 be the distance between the source and detector as measured in the minkowski metric .",
    "the classical flight time of light pulses is just @xmath123 , in units where the speed of light is unity .",
    "the geodesic interval function @xmath82 is defined as one - half of the square of the geodesic distance between a pair of spacetime points .",
    "let @xmath124 be this function in flat spacetime .",
    "as expected , @xmath125 when @xmath126 .",
    "suppose that as a result of a perturbation of the metric , the actual flight time becomes @xmath127 .",
    "the geodesic interval function is now @xmath128 = r \\delta t + o((\\delta",
    "t)^2 ) \\,.\\ ] ] thus the first order variation in @xmath82 is @xmath129 .",
    "suppose that the flight time now fluctuates so that the average of @xmath130 vanishes , but the average of its square does not .",
    "the root - mean - square fluctuation in flight time is then @xmath131    the computation of @xmath9 in a particular model of quantum gravity effects is reduced to the computation of @xmath17 .",
    "it is shown in ford ( 1995 ) and ford & svaiter ( 1996 ) that @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the affine parameter along and @xmath134 is the tangent vector to the unperturbed geodesic .",
    "the above expression is a double integral of the renormalized graviton two point function , @xmath135 , taken over an unperturbed geodesic .",
    "this two point function is the crucial quantity which a quantum gravity model must provide .",
    "because different theories of quantum gravity yield different two point functions , measurements or constraints on the value of @xmath9 can potentially discriminate among the theories .",
    "for example , a natural starting point for quantum calculations may be the graviton two point function of minkowski spacetime .",
    "if , however , it is not renormalized , the integral diverges . the usual response to this problem is to require that the renormalized two point function vanish in minkowski spacetime . if this is the correct solution , then @xmath136 , and there are no lightcone fluctuations in minkowski spacetime .",
    "many current theories of quantum gravity do not , however , use 4-dimensional minkowski spacetime as the starting point . for example ,",
    "quantum gravity derived in the context of string theory ( ellis , mavromatos , & nanopoulis 2000 ) , spacetime foam ( garay 1998 ) , and canonical quantum gravity in the loop approximation ( gambini & pullin 1999 ) all predict lightcone fluctuations .",
    "here we describe specific models in which lightcone fluctuations are expected .",
    "these models are kaluza - klein theories with compact extra dimensions . in these models ,",
    "our four - dimensional world is a subspace of a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the reason that the extra dimensions are not readily observed would be that they are compactified , so that one can travel only a very small distance in a higher dimension before returning to the same point .",
    "however , confining a quantum field to a small region enhances its quantum fluctuations .",
    "this effect is a consequence of the uncertainty principle , and is analogous to what happens to a single quantum particle confined in a small region of space .",
    "one effect of extra compact space dimensions is to create a spectrum of massive modes in the theory .",
    "this is the `` kaluza - klein tower '' of masses predicted by such theories , which are inversely proportional to the compactification length .",
    "thus as the length becomes smaller , these masses increase .",
    "it is sometimes argued that the effects of compactification should become smaller in this limit because large masses should give a smaller contribution to virtual processes .",
    "this argument is incorrect , however .",
    "the effect of the infinite sum of masses scales oppositely with length from that of a single mass , as can be understood from the above uncertainty principle argument .",
    "thus kaluza - klein theories can predict observably large lightcone fluctuations .",
    "the precise prediction of a particular model can be found only by a difficult calculation , and tend to be very sensitive to the details of the compactification model . in yu & ford ( 1999 , 1999b , 2000 ) , @xmath9 was computed for a variety of models which postulate flat extra dimensions . in the case of the five dimensional kaluza - klein theory , which has one extra space dimension of length @xmath137 , it was found that @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the planck time .",
    "the value of @xmath10 depends upon the cosmological model . to derive an estimate for the limit that the microwave background spectrum places on the value of @xmath137",
    ", we simply take @xmath140 roughly the distance traveled by a classical light wave in @xmath141 gyr . with this estimate",
    ", we find that @xmath137 must be greater than or equal to approximately a millimeter .",
    "that is @xmath142    thus , our constraint on @xmath9 from the microwave background , places a very strong constraint on @xmath137 .",
    "this constraint is so strong that it essentially rules out the five dimensional kaluza - klein theory .",
    "note that the form of @xmath9 given in eq .",
    "( 24 ) was calculated in flat spacetime , rather than in a robertson - walker spacetime . in principle",
    ", there will a be correction due to the spacetime curvature in an expanding universe .",
    "however , this should be very small because the wavelength of the photons is always very small compared to the horizon size .",
    "( see footnote 1 . )",
    "apart from this correction , there is the issue of the interpretation of the length @xmath10 . in flat spacetime , this is the distance from the source to the detector as measured in the latter s frame of reference . in the case of the expanding universe",
    ", we can imagine a sequence of comoving observers spaced in such a way that spacetime is nearly flat in between each pair of observers .",
    "the proper distance which a light ray travels between a given pair is just the flight time in the frame of one of the observers , in units where the speed of light is unity .",
    "thus the net proper distance traveled by the ray as measured by this sequence is just the elapsed comoving robertson - walker time .",
    "thus our key assumption is that we can use the flat spacetime result , with @xmath10 being taken to be this time . since our chosen numerical value for @xmath10 , and the associated limit on @xmath137 , are basically order of magnitude estimates , changes due to using a robertson - walker metric are within our estimated uncertainties .",
    "note that , even the weakest result consistent with these uncertainties still eliminates the kaluza - klein model we have considered .    as discussed in  5 and",
    "noted in yu & ford 2000 , even stronger constraints can , in principle , be obtained by studying spectra peaked at higher frequencies .",
    "the microwave background , however , provides advantages over many other presently available sources because its spectrum is very precisely measured , and the light reaching us has traveled over the longest possible baseline for an electromagnetic signal .",
    "there is an additional advantage in using the microwave background : its relatively low frequency obviates complications that might be related to the _ correlation time _ for quantum metric fluctuations . the correlation time , @xmath20 ,",
    "can be thought of as being the characteristic time scale of the metric fluctuations .",
    "recall that what we really measure is not the actual flight time of a pulse , but rather the difference in flight times of a pair of pulses .",
    "if the two pulses are emitted within a time of @xmath20 of one another , they essentially propagate through the same classical spacetime geometry and their arrival times are not affected by the metric fluctuations .",
    "it is only when the pair of pulses are separated by more than @xmath20 that the variation in their arrival times is expected to be of order @xmath9 .",
    "thus one can use data on the shapes of spectra to constrain quantum gravity models only when characteristic frequency of the spectrum is less than about @xmath143 . as in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the correlation time @xmath20 needs to be obtained by a difficult calculation in a specific model .",
    "one might expect @xmath20 to be of order @xmath137 , as this is the characteristic wavelength of the graviton modes which are most altered by the compactification .",
    "however , in the five dimensional kaluza - klein model , one actually finds ( yu and ford 2000 ) the much smaller value of @xmath144 when @xmath145 .",
    "it is therefore possible , at least in principle , for measurements of spectra peaked at higher frequencies to also place meaningful constraints on this model .",
    "the corresponding calculation has not , however , been performed for other models , so their correlation times are unknown .",
    "thus , although data on high frequency spectra potentially lead to stronger constraints on @xmath9 , they can also be limited in their usefulness in constraining models which predict relatively long correlation times . in this sense ,",
    "data on lower frequency spectra , such as the microwave background , provide information that can not be obtained from higher frequency spectra .",
    "we are naturally also interested in constraints that may apply to other quantum theories .",
    "interestingly enough , however , the calculations that predict the size of s are sensitive to the details of the quantum theory . for example",
    ", kaluza - klein models involving more than one flat extra dimension , at least up through 11-dimensional theories , do not lead to significant lightcone fluctuation effects .",
    "yet , for other theories spanning the broad range of possible quantum theories of gravity , including kaluza - klein models in which the extra dimensions are not flat , it could well be that predictions would have observable consequences for the microwave background and can therefore be tested within the framework we have established here .",
    "indeed , the microwave background would provide the ideal test for such a theory if the computed correlation time is significantly longer than that computed for the 5-dimensional kaluza - klein model with one flat extra dimension .",
    "we have pointed out that the best way at present to observe the effects of the minute differences in arrival times predicted by s is through spectral measurements .",
    "we have computed the perturbation of a thermal spectrum due to frequency - independent s.      we find the form of the perturbed spectrum to be distinctive .",
    "more power is added near the peak of the thermal spectrum and also at frequencies greater than roughly @xmath146 times the frequency at the peak , with a pronounced decrease in power just before the rise at high frequencies . for values of @xmath147",
    "the lightcone fluctuations play such an important role that the approximation we have made by terminating the series expansion at second order breaks down ; such large s would cause the spectrum to deviate so significantly from the thermal form that a thermal spectrum alone would not necessarily be the obvious candidate for a model fit .",
    "whatever the actual value of @xmath68 , the s place a distinctive stamp on the spectrum .",
    "thus , if @xmath148 is large enough to render s observable , measurements taken at a range of frequencies should be able to confirm that deviations from the pure thermal form are due to s and not to some other effect .",
    "for @xmath149 measurements either to discover or constrain s are most effective when taken in regions around the extrema of @xmath150 ; i.e. , near @xmath151 and @xmath152 , as well as at values of @xmath48 greater than @xmath153 although we have not calculated the exact result for larger values of @xmath68 , these same regions of the waveband will almost certainly be the ones in which the effects of s are most pronounced .",
    "it is important to note that the quantity which is constrained by the data is not @xmath148 itself , but rather the parameter @xmath109 thus , even if the s are frequency - independent , the size of the parameter @xmath154 is proportional to the temperature of the thermal source . writing @xmath155 in this way makes it clear that the largest effects are expected for the hottest sources .",
    "suppose that we have observed the spectrum from a thermal source of temperature @xmath156 let @xmath157 represent a measure of the observational limits on fractional deviations from a thermal spectrum .",
    "these observations allow us to place an upper limit on @xmath158 @xmath159 if , for example , measurements as sensitive as those we now have for the microwave background were possible for gev sources , the limits on @xmath148 could be as small as @xmath160 or @xmath161 s.    we return to the question of whether s lead to angular effects . in the appendix",
    "we argue that angular effects should occur at higher order than the spectral effects we have studied here .",
    "there are two important caveats , however .",
    "the first is that the arguments are developed in the context of a linearized theory .",
    "the second , and perhaps most important , is that we have assumed translational symmetry , which does not strictly hold when the photons travel through a curved spacetime .",
    "this issue must therefore be revisited for each quantum gravity model under study . in quantum gravity models that differ from the specific kaluza - klein case considered here , a spread in angle due to s could influence our inferences about the isotropy of the cmb .",
    "if the source of radiation is point - like , angular spread due to s could lead to an observed  fuzziness \" in the image .",
    "the computations necessary to make specific predictions for a given quantum theory of gravity are difficult , and have not yet been carried out for many theories .",
    "the general pattern is that there are @xmath146 relevant time scales .",
    "the first is the planck time , @xmath162  s. the second time scale is the time scale set by the average difference in arrival times @xmath158 the value of @xmath148 depends on the fundamental underlying theory and on the path from source to detector .",
    "this is also true of the third time scale , the correlation time , @xmath163 .",
    "@xmath20 is the characteristic time scale of the metric fluctuations as integrated along the path to the detector .",
    "pulses received at times differing from each other by less than @xmath20 will have experienced more - or - less the same spacetime as they travel toward the detector , and so the influence of quantum fluctuations will not be discernible in effects that rely on differences in their arrival times .",
    "thus , the detection of quantum fluctuation effects is possible only if the condition @xmath164 is satisfied .    because both @xmath20 and @xmath148 are model - dependent , separate computations must be carried out for each theory to be tested .",
    "in addition , both quantities are path dependent , and this must be taken into account as well .",
    "in general , the value of @xmath20 places a lower bound , equal to a few times @xmath20 , for the minimum value of @xmath148 that would be detectable .",
    "if the predicted value of @xmath148 is larger than this minimum value , then eq .  ( 26 ) provides a guide as to the temperatures of the sources ( and the sensitivity of spectral measurements ) best suited to either measure the effects of the fluctuations or else falsify the theory .",
    "we have shown that data taken by firas can , taken by itself , rule out one quantum theory of gravity , a five - dimensional kaluza - klein model in which the  extra \" dimension is flat . in this theory",
    ", @xmath148 would have to be larger than allowed by the firas observations in order for the size of the extra dimension to be small enough that it should not already have had other observable consequences .",
    "thus , no further measurements are required to eliminate this theory from consideration .",
    "our analysis of the microwave background data is the most detailed analysis to place upper limits on @xmath0 and provides the most secure upper limits to date .",
    "furthermore , the correlation times for other models of quantum gravity may tend to be longer , making it difficult to rule them out by studying high energy emission .",
    "such models could possibly be ruled out by the the bound we derived based on the microwave background .",
    "further theoretical calculations of @xmath9 and of the correlation time for other theories of quantum gravity will be required to determine how useful limits derived from the microwave background will be .",
    "since the limits may be important , we next turn to consider what would be needed to use the microwave background to derive a lower upper bound on @xmath158      there are two ways future measurements of the spectrum of the microwave background could lower the upper bound on @xmath148 we have derived .",
    "the first way is by decreasing the uncertainty limits in the wavelength regime already studied by cobe . to improve the limits on @xmath148 by an order of magnitude",
    ", we would have to decrease the uncertainty limits on the measurements by roughly @xmath22 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is because improvements in constraints on @xmath165 by a factor @xmath166 , translate to improving the limits on @xmath167 by a factor @xmath168 .",
    "the second way to lower the upper bound on @xmath148 is to recognize that the fractional effects of lightcone fluctuations become larger at higher frequencies ( even in the case we have considered in which @xmath148 is frequency independent ) .",
    "it would therefore appear to be considerably easier to find evidence of them by extending measurements of the cmb to higher frequencies .",
    "although this is true in principle , radiation from the galaxy and far infrared background become more significant at higher frequencies , making it difficult to to unambiguously attribute radiation at higher frequencies to the microwave background .",
    "thus , improved models of galactic emission are required .    both figures 6 and 8 demonstrate that decreasing the upper bound of @xmath148 by as much as @xmath22 orders of magnitude would require either a remarkable increase in the precision with which we measure the spectrum of the microwave background and/or a much better understanding of galactic and far infrared extra - galactic emission .",
    "while significant improvements of either type are unlikely in the short term , the fact that we may still be decades away from a definitive theory of quantum gravity means that we should consider the long - term prospects as well as the prospects for the near term .",
    "[ [ identification - of - spectral - distortions - with - lightcone - fluctuations ] ] identification of spectral distortions with lightcone fluctuations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    if significant deviations from a thermal spectrum were to be discovered , it would naturally be important to consider whether we would be able to distinguish a signal due to lightcone fluctuations from signals that might be associated with other effects .",
    "figure 7 illustrates that the effects of a chemical potential and/or comptonization have a spectral pattern sufficiently different from that predicted by s , that we should be able to distinguish the latter from the other effects .",
    "in fact it is interesting to note that , when we consider the limiting values of parameters consistent with the cobe data , the effects of comptonization and the effects of s would very nearly cancel .",
    "this has the interesting implication that , on the basis of the microwave data alone , the combination of comptonization and s can not be ruled out . since , however , the physical effects giving rise to comptonization are completely different from those associated with s , a nearly exact cancellation between these two effects is is highly unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the cmb data can definitively rule out comptonization effects , only if supplemented by additional information , e.g. , if stronger upper limits can eventually be placed on @xmath148 by studying emission of radiation with higher energies .",
    "because @xmath169 depends more strongly on @xmath170 than on @xmath171 the best way to lower the upper bound we have derived is to observe the spectra of higher - temperature sources , even if the precision of the observations is not as good as that achieved by firas .",
    "the challenge then is to identify high - temperature sources of thermal radiation .",
    "thermal spectra are not the norm for x - ray and @xmath24-ray sources . for example",
    ", the accretion processes that power most x - ray binaries typically give rise to spectra that are more complicated .",
    "nevertheless there are suggestions that the x - ray spectra associated with some processes are thermal .",
    "neutron stars cooling after nuclear - burning induced x - ray bursts may be one example ; the data suggest that these and perhaps other cooling neutron stars may be emitting blackbody spectra ( see , e.g. , rutledge _ et al .",
    "there are two problems however .",
    "the first is that present data do not constrain the spectra very well ; i.e. , significant departures from a thermal spectrum may be compatible with existing observations .",
    "the second problem is that the physics of the source systems is complicated and even a perfectly thermal spectrum can be distorted by interactions with material near the emitter .",
    "for example , even if a white dwarf or neutron star emits a thermal spectrum , interaction of the emergent radiation with the atmosphere of the compact object alters the spectrum .",
    "basic physical principles can be used to compute the spectral form of the alterations ; more work needs to be done , however , to develop models good enough that we can subtract atmospheric effects from the observed spectrum in a way that is as reliable as the subtraction of , e.g. , the dipole contribution to the microwave background .    both the challenge of better spectral measurements , and the challenge of better spectral models will be met .",
    "while progress in the next few years may not be significant for the purpose of studying s , enough progress can be expected to occur over a period of decades .",
    "since the formulation of a viable and testable theory of quantum gravity is likely to take at least as long as the necessary astrophysical advances , high - energy measurements should eventually play an important role in studying s.      * the microwave background :  * the microwave background data already rule out the 5-dimensional theory in which the  extra \" dimension is flat .",
    "it is very likely that this data will also place significant constraints on other quantum theories of gravity .",
    "progress awaits computations of @xmath148 and @xmath20 for those theories .    * other spectra :  * among thermal spectra",
    ", we can gain the greatest advantage , i.e. , place the most stringent upper bounds on @xmath0 by studying the spectra of high - temperature sources .",
    "however , as pointed out above , present - day limitations of both our observations and theoretical models may not allow thermal spectra to play a major role in the study of s in the immediate future . instead , line emission may play the most important role in the short - term .",
    "( see , e.g. , data sets such as those described by songaila _ et al . _ 1994 . )",
    "high - energy lines potentially provide the strongest constraints .",
    "for example , by studying x - ray lines with _",
    "chandra _ , we can potentially place an upper bound on @xmath148 that is @xmath172 orders of magnitude smaller than the one derived in this paper , although we may lose @xmath173 orders of magnitude because the precision of the x - ray measurements now possible is in the range of @xmath174 , instead of at the level of a few parts in @xmath175 in brief , we can expect x - ray measurements possible in the short - term to reduce the upper limit on @xmath148 to @xmath176 s. if gamma - ray lines can be used for similar investigations , even smaller spreads in arrival time can be either measured or constrained .",
    "the caveat that accompanies all such constraints , is that the value of the correlation time @xmath3 computed in the context of the theory we seek to test , must be smaller than the limits on @xmath158      the quest for a quantum theory of gravity has been one of the major themes of physics in the twentieth century .",
    "as the search continues into the twenty first century , uncertainties about important features of the theory abound .",
    "consider an optimistic scenario in which , during the coming decades , theorists manage to hone in on a small range of candidate theories that make clear and verifiable predictions . even in this case",
    ", the fact that key predictions may not be testable in earth - based accelerators will undoubtedly mean that astrophysical observations during the present century and beyond will play important roles in eliminating some theories and possibly verifying others .",
    "we therefore want to emphasize that , in order to assess the role astrophysical observations might play in studying s , we must take the long view .",
    "it is true that the spectra of high - temperature sources are not yet well constrained by the observations , and that many physical effects we now understand imperfectly ( such as the influence of neutron - star atmospheres ) can themselves alter spectra that start out as purely thermal . in @xmath141 years , @xmath177 years , @xmath178 years , however , we will have made improved measurements with much lower levels of uncertainty than at present .",
    "furthermore , theoretical models of even complex phenomena such as neutron star atmospheres , and the galactic contribution to radiation across the spectrum , will be well - developed and tested .",
    "observers will therefore eventually be able to subtract from their observed spectra effects associated with many complicated physical situations ( e.g. , local conditions near the emitter ) , with as much confidence as the firas team was able to subtract out the dipole contribution from their observed spectrum .",
    "this , together with a wealth of well - studied sources at different temperatures and lying at different distances away from us , means that a long - term ambitious program like the one described below will be possible .",
    "first , a succession of measurements at higher and higher energies can place constraints on the level of s , eliminating some candidate theories of quantum gravity . if , at some energy , definitive evidence of s is found , then investigations of sources at similar temperatures but at different distances will help to constrain the form of metric fluctuations .",
    "( note that sources lying behind large mass distributions also provide ways to sample different path lengths . )",
    "investigations of sources at similar distances but at different temperatures will help to explore possible frequency dependence of s.    in short , we think that during the coming decades , radiation from a wealth of astrophysical sources will provide even more stringent constraints on s , or else will discover definitive evidence of their existence . in either case , these astrophysical systems will teach us much more about s and the quantum gravity theories that predict them",
