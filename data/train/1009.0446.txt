    "fiber optic raman amplifiers constitute an integral part of many contemporary high - speed optical networks . owing to their broad amplification bandwidth",
    ", raman amplifiers successfully compete with erbium - doped - fiber amplifiers , @xcite . by the nature of the process of stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) in silica fibers ,",
    "raman amplifiers are highly polarization - dependent : the gain coefficient reaches its maximum value whenever the state of polarization ( sop ) of the signal is parallel to the pump sop . whereas the amplifier gain is reduced by two orders of magnitude if the two sops are orthogonal , @xcite . in real fiber networks the fiber birefringence changes stochastically along a fiber span .",
    "the net effect of this stochastically varying birefringence is to greatly reduce the polarization dependence of raman gain . as a result",
    ", the effective raman gain reduces to its span - averaged value , which is equal to approximately half of its maximum value .",
    "such averaging of the gain between two orthogonal states of polarization is a favorable feature , since polarization - dependent effects are undesirable in most of the telecom applications which have been developed so far .",
    "the value of the polarization - mode dispersion ( pmd ) coefficient @xmath0 quantifies the degree of gain averaging , which appears to be rather efficient for @xmath1  ps@xmath2 . for smaller values of @xmath0 , the onset of polarization - dependent raman gain is typically combated by scrambling the pump sop .    in this paper",
    "our interest diverges from the common trend , as it focuses on the exploitation of the polarization dependence of raman gain .",
    "motivated by the recent developments of transmission protocols based on polarization multiplexing @xcite , we are interested in developing nonlinear devices for achieving all - optical and ultrafast polarization control . thus , we are interested in the use of fiber with low values of the pmd coefficient , and do not perform the scrambling of the pump beam . moreover , the stronger the polarization - dependent gain , the better the performance of our device  a raman polarizer .",
    "these devices are raman amplifiers that are being fed by a weak unpolarized light signal , and convert it into a powerful yet highly polarized light towards the output .",
    "preliminary theoretical investigations of raman polarizers and their proof - of - principle experiment , both in the co - propagating geometry , have been recently reported in ref .",
    "this geometry has been analyzed in more details in the undepleted regime in ref .",
    "@xcite here we set our goal in developing a simple and physically transparent theory of raman polarizers which is applicable to both co - propagating and counter - propagating geometries , and suitable for further use as a tool for analyzing the operation of these devices .",
    "our goal is also to address the two main issues which are related to the performance of raman polarizers .",
    "the first issue is the degree of polarization ( dop ) of the outcoming signal .",
    "given that the average dop of the scrambled signal is zero initially , we say that our goal is reached if the dop of the output beam is close to unity . in this case",
    ", we shall refer to such raman amplifiers as ideal raman polarizers .",
    "the second issue is provided by the output signal sop ; namely , its relation to the pump sop .",
    "the dop and sop of the outcoming signal fully characterize the performance of raman polarizers .",
    "the third important quantity is the value of gain of the raman polarizer .",
    "we shall comment on this issue , too .",
    "it is important to distinguish from the outset between conventional raman amplifiers and raman polarizers .",
    "typical raman amplifiers for telecom applications are long , often surpassing @xmath3  km , require pump powers of the order of @xmath4  w , and operate with relatively high values of the pmd coefficient .",
    "in contrast , raman polarizers are shorter , requiring a fiber length of the order of @xmath5  km , pumped with high power light  of the order of @xmath6  w and higher , and favor low values of the pmd coefficient .",
    "the last two characteristics substantially strengthen the polarization dependence of the gain , as we shall see from the subsequent analysis .",
    "therefore the operational regimes of raman amplifiers and raman polarizers are drastically different , thus preventing the results of the theory of raman polarizers to become a trivial copy of the results already known from the theory of raman amplifiers .",
    "the description of polarization - dependent gain in randomly birefringent fibers is based on the vector theory of srs , as it was developed for instance in refs .",
    "theories presented in refs .",
    "@xcite bring analytical insights into the problem , but their applicability is limited to the regime in which the beat length of the fiber @xmath7 is substantially smaller than the birefringence correlation length @xmath8 : @xmath9 . because of this restriction , those theories are not suitable for the proper description of raman polarizers , for which the opposite inequality usually holds , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the analysis that follows .",
    "in contrast , the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite is most general and accurate , however it is resource - consuming in terms of computational time , as it requires @xmath10 longer integration time than the theory which is presented here .",
    "moreover , since the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite is not formulated in terms of deterministic differential equations , it is rather difficult to extract from it physically transparent information about the role of the different processes ruling the overall polarization dynamics .    as a matter of fact",
    "our theory is essentially the generalization of one - beam theory of wai and menyuk in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of two beams interacting not only via the kerr but also via the raman effect .",
    "it is close to the approach that was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , but it proceeds till the end with virtually no approximations .",
    "the only important requirement here is that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total length of the fiber and @xmath13 its nonlinear length .",
    "this inequality holds true for almost all practically relevant situations .",
    "another assumption in our theory is that in the randomly varying birefringence tensor characterizing the fiber @xmath14 we shall only treat the orientation of the birefringence axis @xmath15 as a stochastic variable , while we keep the value of the birefringence @xmath16 as a constant ( this is the so - called fixed modulus model ) .",
    "it is now a well established fact that the theory with @xmath15 as the only stochastic variable and the theory where both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are stochastic variables ( random modulus model ) both produce virtually identical results . in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are usual pauli matrices .",
    "note that we define the birefringence beat length as @xmath19 .",
    "starting from the most basic model of interaction of two fields within a kerr- and raman - active medium , whose tensorial response as it is relevant to fused silica is properly taken into account , see ref .",
    "@xcite , we follow the lines of derivations that were outlined in ref .  @xcite and formulate the equation of motion of the pump beam in the form @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{2}{3}\\gamma_{ps } \\left[(u_s^*\\cdot u_s)u_p+(u_s\\cdot u_p)u_s^ * + ( u_p\\cdot u_s^*)u_s\\right ] + i\\epsilon_p g_0(u_p\\cdot u_s^*)u_s\\ , . \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the field vector written in terms of normal polarization modes @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the propagation constant and @xmath25 is its frequency derivative .",
    "the upper sign (  @xmath26 \" ) describes the configuration when the signal and pump beams propagate in the fiber in one direction ( co - propagating geometry ) , while the lower sign (  @xmath27 \" ) is related to the situation when they propagate in opposite directions ( counter - propagating geometry ) .",
    "the self - polarization modulation ( spm ) coefficient @xmath28 is the usual nonlinear coefficient of silica , @xmath29 , calculated at the central frequency @xmath30 of the pump beam .",
    "cross - polarization modulation ( xpm ) coefficient @xmath31 is also equal to @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the raman gain coefficient ; @xmath34 .",
    "the equations for the signal beam and all coefficients are the same as above but with indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 interchanged , and with @xmath37 .",
    "first , let us transform the equation ( [ 2 ] ) to the local axes of birefringence by performing the rotation of the field vector @xmath38 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ 2 ] ) is not altered by this transformation , the only difference being the change of the form of the birefringence tensor , which now becomes @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is the derivative of @xmath15 with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "it is different from zero owing to the random changes of orientation of the birefringence axes .",
    "namely , the change of @xmath15 is driven by the white noise process : @xmath44 , with zero mean and @xmath45 , where @xmath8 is the birefringence correlation length , as mentioned in the introduction .    in line with our assumption that @xmath11 , we separate the fast motion related to the rapid changes of @xmath15 from the slow motion that occurs on the scale of the nonlinear length .",
    "it is important to note that this separation is exact and yet does not involve any approximation .",
    "the approximation is to be made at a later stage .",
    "the required transformations read as @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 obey equations of motion @xmath51    these transformations eliminate the birefringence terms from the equations of motion of @xmath52 and @xmath53 and bring about a vast number of cubic terms composed of different combinations of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and their complex conjugates .",
    "factors in front of these terms are products of two coefficients of the form @xmath58 , or @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "products with @xmath62 we shall call self - products , while with @xmath63 cross - products . here , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .    in the thus obtained equations of motion for @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we perform the ensemble average ( over realizations of the random process that describes the linear birefringence ) .",
    "thus , we write @xmath78 instead of @xmath58 .",
    "this change holds true only in the limit when the stochastic variations are faster than the nonlinear beam evolution .",
    "this is exactly the place in the derivation where our single approximation comes into play . at this point",
    "we also need to apply the ergodic theorem @xmath79 our goal is to calculate ensemble averages of all necessary self- and cross - products , and on this way we may complete the derivation of the differential equations for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath80 with @xmath81 can be easily formulated basing ourselves on equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 7_1 ] ) . as these equations are linear , in order to find an ensemble average of any function of these coefficients ( in our case pair products ) we need to construct a generator .",
    "we refer to the appendix in ref .",
    "@xcite for details of this procedure , and only give here the final result . with this generator we are able to formulate the equations of motion for the ensemble averages of the products of the coefficients .",
    "thus the solutions to the equations of motion @xmath82 yield the result for the self - products @xmath83 ,    @xmath84 ,    and @xmath85 , if we associate them with @xmath86 with initial conditions given as @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the remaining self - products @xmath90 ,    @xmath91 ,    @xmath92 ,    and @xmath93 , can be found from the equations @xmath94g_5\\ , , \\label{13}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial g_2}{\\partial z}=\\frac{2}{l_c}(g_1-g_2 ) -2\\left[\\pm\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_p)+\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_s)\\right]g_6\\ , , \\label{14}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial g_3}{\\partial z}= 2\\left[\\pm\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_p)+\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_s)\\right]g_6\\ , , \\label{15}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial g_4}{\\partial z}= -2\\left[\\pm\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_p)-\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_s)\\right]g_5\\ , , \\label{16}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial g_5}{\\partial z}= \\left[\\pm\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_p)-\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_s)\\right](g_4-g_1 ) -\\frac{1}{l_c}g_5\\ , , \\label{17}\\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial g_6}{\\partial z}= \\left[\\pm\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_p)+\\delta\\beta ( \\omega_s)\\right](g_2-g_3 ) -\\frac{1}{l_c}g_6\\ , , \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we associate them with @xmath95 , with initial conditions as @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively .    in order to find the cross - products we constructed appropriate generators and found that all the cross - products that are of interest to us turn out to be equal to zero .",
    "similarly , terms of the form @xmath100 also vanish .",
    "thus , many spm , xpm , and raman terms in the final equations of motion disappear .",
    "the thus found equations of motion for the fields are conveniently formulated in stokes space .",
    "they read as @xmath101 here @xmath102 is a three - component vector : @xmath103 , whose components are defined as @xmath104 where @xmath40 .",
    "it is instructive to formulate separate equations for the powers of the signal and pump beams , which may be defined through the components of the stokes vectors as @xmath105 : @xmath106    matrices in equations ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) are all diagonal with elements    @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "these elements are different for the counter - propagating and the co - propagating interaction geometries .    in order to complete our theory",

    "these equations describe vector raman amplification under rather general conditions .",
    "the spm , xpm , and raman matrices contain @xmath43-dependent elements on their diagonals , whose values are expressed in terms of the self - product coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ 26])-([34 ] ) , while the coefficients themselves are found as the solutions of equations ( [ 9])-([12 ] ) and ( [ 13])-([18 ] ) .",
    "we are about to apply these model equations to the problem of raman polarizers . before treating this specific case ,",
    "some comment about the raman matrix is in order .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the net effect of polarization - dependent gain is the attraction of the signal sop to the pump sop . while this is certainly the case for isotropic fibers , an extension of this idea to the case of randomly birefringent fibers",
    "should be undertaken with caution . as a matter of fact",
    ", we found that in general in randomly birefringent fibers the signal sop is not attracted to the pump sop . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "the most straightforward way is to analyze equation ( [ 25 ] ) for the power of the signal beam . for isotropic fibers , we get @xmath112 , so that parallel signal and pump sops provide the maximally possible gain .",
    "( @xmath113  black solid , @xmath114  red dashed , and @xmath115  green dotted ) as function of distance in the fiber for @xmath116  m and @xmath117  m. ( note that the black solid and green dotted curves nearly coincide , i.e. @xmath118 . ]    when we turn to the case of randomly birefringent fibers , we find that the elements of the raman matrix are not always equal to each other in the co - propagating geometry , as it was demonstrated in ref .  @xcite . moreover , these elements are never equal to each other in the counter - propagating geometry , as it is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ ris1 ] . as can be seen in this figure , the raman matrix elements are not only different from each other but they can also be negative .",
    "although in general the signal sop is not attracted to the pump sop , the analysis of the co - propagating configuration in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in the regime when raman amplifiers act as ideal raman polarizers the output signal sop is always almost perfectly aligned with the pump sop .",
    "for this regime , the polarization properties of the randomly birefringent fibers are virtually the same as in the case of isotropic fibers .",
    "on the other hand in the counter - propagating geometry the situation is totally different . in the regime",
    "when raman amplifiers act as ideal raman polarizers , the typical relation between the diagonal elements of the raman matrix is as shown in fig .",
    "thus , the first and the third components of the signal stokes vector are attracted to the corresponding components of the pump stokes vector , while the second components are repelled from each other .",
    "therefore whenever the pump sop contains an appreciable admixture of the circular polarization , the signal sop is never attracted to the pump sop . in the next section we suggest a simple rule with a wide range of applicability on how to determine the output signal sop .    the polarization - dependent gain is quantified by the values of the diagonal elements of the raman matrix .",
    "the larger these values , the better the performance of the raman polarizers . in fibers with high pmd values the diagonal elements quickly vanish near the input fiber end already . for smaller pmd values",
    "the @xmath43-dependent elements of the raman matrix keep appreciable values across the whole fiber span , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "indeed , low pmd fibers are good candidates for the implementation of raman polarizers .",
    "the elements of the xpm matrix exhibit a similar dependence upon the pmd coefficient and have a magnitude which is comparable to that of the diagonal elements of the raman matrix .",
    "nevertheless the nonlinear polarization rotation which is due to the xpm interaction is very weak , and it has virtually no effect on the performance of raman polarizers operating in the undepleted regime .",
    "the spm effect for the signal beam has also no impact on the performance of raman polarizers .",
    "first , this is because the diagonal elements of the spm matrix @xmath119 vanish on first @xmath120  m of the fiber for the practically relevant range of beat lengths and correlation lengths , a range that we define as follows : @xmath121 which is given here in km .",
    "second , because the signal beam is too weak to experience a significant nonlinear self - interaction , especially near its input end .",
    "in contrast , the spm effect can in principle be sizable for the pump beam . given that the pump power is relatively high ( @xmath122  w in our simulations ) , even the first @xmath120  m are enough to perturb the pump sop .",
    "however , these perturbations remain relatively small ( of the order of @xmath123% ) for a pump power as high as @xmath122  w.",
    "we performed extensive simulations in a configuration where the pump and signal beams counter - propagate through a @xmath5  km long fiber , and the pump power is set to @xmath122  w at @xmath124 .",
    "the input power of the signal beam is set to be equal to @xmath123  mw , which is low enough to ensure that raman amplification occurs in the undepleted regime for all @xmath43 and the entire range of fiber parameters .",
    "we varied the beat length and the correlation length within the range that is defined in eq .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "we followed two quantities of interest at the output end of the fiber at @xmath124 as function of the beat and the correlation lengths .",
    "the first such quantity is the dop ( @xmath125 ) of the signal beam , which is the central characteristic of raman polarizers . starting with an unpolarized signal beam ( with @xmath126 ) , we aim at finding such parameter regimes for which the outcoming signal beam has dop close to unity .",
    "the unpolarized signal beam is modeled in the stokes space as an ensemble of beams with @xmath127 states of polarizations that are uniformly distributed over the entire poincar sphere . on the other hand",
    "the pump is a polarized beam whose sop is varied as detailed below .",
    "the second quantity of interest is the so - called alignment parameter , which is defined as @xmath128 where the angle brackets indicate average over all @xmath129 realizations of the sops of the input scrambled signal beam .",
    "this quantity characterizes the average orientation of the signal sop with respect to the pump sop .",
    "note that in the copropagating geometry the appropriate alignment parameter reads as @xcite , @xmath130 this alignment parameter is nothing but an average cosine of the angle between the pump and signal sops in stokes space .",

    "two circles on plot d ) indicate one ( of infinitely many ) pair of points with equal pmd coefficients .",
    "other parameters are : input signal power @xmath123  mw , input pump power @xmath122  w , raman gain @xmath133  ( w@xmath134km)@xmath135 , nonlinearity parameter @xmath136  ( w@xmath134km)@xmath135 , linear fiber losses @xmath137  db / km , total length of the fiber @xmath138  km . ]",
    "we start with the characterization of the performance of the raman polarizer in the counter - propagating geometry by following the @xmath125 and @xmath139 for four different sops of the pump beam and two values of the beat length , as a function of the correlation length .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in the four panels of fig .",
    "all four plots demonstrate that small correlation lengths and large beat lengths favor the efficiency of raman polarizers .",
    "in the first three plots the maximum dop is @xmath140 , while on the fourth plot it is of only @xmath141 . such large difference in the maximal achievable dops gives a hint that the performance of raman polarizers is rather sensitive to the choice of the pump sop .",
    "for the value of the birefringence length a ) @xmath142  km and b ) @xmath143  km .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "these two pump sops are those which maximize ( black , solid ) and minimize ( red , dashed ) the dop of the output signal beam . ]",
    "how sensitive is this dependence is demonstrated by the two panels of fig .  [ ris3 ] . for generating each point on these plots we took @xmath144 realizations of the pump sops , and for each of this sop we followed the signal dop as a function of the correlation length .",
    "we plot only those two realizations which provide maximum and minimum dop . from the analysis of these plots",
    "we may conclude that from the viewpoint of efficient raman polarizers only a limited range of pump sops leads to a good performance , while the rest of pump sops perform poorly . the particular sop which maximizes the dop depends on both the correlation and the beat length values .    in all of the four plots of fig .",
    "[ ris2 ] we may observe that the alignment parameter is relatively close to unity whenever the dop is more than @xmath145 . from this result",
    "we draw the conclusion that on average the sop of the outcoming signal beam is related to the pump sop as dictated by the alignment parameter that was introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) . a more detailed information on the signal sop is available when basing ourselves on the following definitions of the alignment factors @xmath146 which are calculated at the raman polarizer output @xmath124 .",
    "these expressions quantify the pairwise proximity of the components of the signal and pump stokes vectors .",
    "the dependence of the alignment factors upon the correlation length for @xmath147  m and for two values of the pump power is plotted in fig .",
    "one may observe that the output signal sop depends on the pump power .",

    "usually , this selection relies on the value of the pmd coefficient . in most practical situations ,",
    "this coefficient fully characterizes a randomly birefringent fiber .",
    "however , in some cases the knowledge of this parameter only is not sufficient for making a conclusion on the performance of raman polarizers , a fact that was first noticed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for example the plot in fig .",
    "[ ris2](d ) demonstrates that two fibers with equal pmd coefficients lead to raman polarizers with rather different performances : in one case @xmath152 , while in the other case it is @xmath123 only . in the regime of ideal raman polarizers ( with dop@xmath153 ) and in the considered parameter range ,",
    "the pmd coefficient is indeed a reliable characteristic , in the sense that fibers with equal pmd coefficients provide raman polarizers with similar performances .",
    "nevertheless , it is often desirable to consider the beat length and the correlation length separately , as we do in this study , rather than unite them under the single pmd coefficient .",
    "note that for @xmath154 , which is always the case for raman polarizers , the pmd coefficient is defined as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath155    , the signal beam is unpolarized .",
    "values of the beat length @xmath7 are indicated on the plot in km .",
    "other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ ris2 ] . ]    finally , let us consider the gain characteristics of raman polarizers .",
    "owing to their strong polarization - dependent gain , the gain of a raman polarizer is sizably larger than that of typical polarization insensitive raman amplifiers ( i.e. , with high pmd values or that use polarization scrambled pump beams ) , see fig .  [ ris5 ] .",
    "this increase in gain demonstrates that raman polarizers are simultaneously very efficient raman amplifiers .",
    "this feature means that the amplification of signal beams with powers in the mw range will almost certainly lead to the depletion of the pump .",
    "this regime is left aside in this study , as our goal was the demonstration of the basic properties of raman polarizers only .",
    "the regime with depleted pump is so rich and parameter - sensitive that it becomes rather difficult to draw general conclusions .",
    "however , if necessary our theory is capable of treating the depleted regime too .",
    "we have developed a general theory for describing the interaction of two beams in randomly birefringent fibers via the kerr and raman effects .",
    "this theory can be applied to both the co - propagation and counter - propagation configurations .",
    "here we considered only the counter - propagating geometry , while details on the co - propagating regime can be found in ref .",
    "a comparison between these two studies shows that the counter - propagating case is more demanding , in that it requires for instance pmd coefficients below @xmath156  ps/@xmath157 for getting dop slightly above @xmath145 in a @xmath5  km fiber . whereas the co - propagating geometry can provide dops as high as @xmath158 for a @xmath0 as large as @xmath159  ps/@xmath157 with only a @xmath160  km long fiber . in both cases",
    "the pump power is @xmath122  w.    however , it is important to point out that the counter - propagating configuration has the advantage of clamping the signal sop to the sop of the pump source . in the co - propagating geometry",
    "the output signal sop is also related to the pump sop , but both depend on the stochastically changing birefringence of the fiber , thus complicating the control over the output signal sop .",
    "in addition to the theoretical model of the raman amplification in randomly birefringent fibers , we presented the scheme for the quantification of the performances of raman polarizers .",
    "we have identified three main characteristics of raman polarizers : the dop of the outcoming signal beam , its sop defined in relation with the pump sop , and the amplifier gain .",
    "the present study was limited to the undepleted regime only , although the theory is readily applicable to the depleted regime as well .",

    "<S> three parameters are selected for the characterization of a raman polarizer : the degree of polarization of the outcoming beam , its state of polarization , and its gain . </S>",
    "<S> all of these parameters represent quantities that are averaged over all random polarization states of the initially unpolarized signal beam . </S>",
    "<S> the presented theory is computer friendly and applicable to virtually all practically relevant situations , including the case of co - propagating beams , and in particular to the undepleted as well as the depleted regimes of the raman polarizer . </S>"
