    "one of the fundamental characteristics of quantum mechanics is associated with the hermiticity of physical observables . in the case of the hamiltonian operator ,",
    "this requirement not only implies real eigen energies but also guarantees probability conservation @xcite .",
    "however , a decade ago it was observed that many non - hermitian hamiltonians possess real spectra @xcite and a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian connects with its equivalent hermitian hamiltonian via a similarity transformation @xcite .",

    "most recently , the growth of interest in the theory of parity - time ( @xmath1 ) symmetric potentials was originated by suggestions of implementation of @xmath2 symmetry in a waveguide with gain and absorption ruschhaupt , which was based on the analogy between quantum mechanics and paraxial optics where the refractive index plays the role of the potential in the schrdinger equation @xcite . by exploiting optical modulation of the refractive index in the complex dielectric permittivity plane and engineering both optical absorption and amplification",
    ", parity - time metamaterials can lead to a series of intriguing optical phenomena and devices , such as absorption enhanced transmission @xcite , double refraction , dynamic power oscillations and nonreciprocity of light propagation @xcite , which can be used to realize a new generation of on - chip isolators and circulators @xcite .",
    "other intriguing results within the framework of @xmath1 optics include the study of bloch oscillations @xcite , coherent perfect absorber - lasers @xcite , and nonlinear switching structures @xcite .    over the last few years",
    ", @xmath1-symmetric lattice models have become a focal point of research @xcite .",
    "lattice models , in general , are popular in physics due to their versatility , availability of exact solutions onsager , the absence of an ultraviolet divergence @xcite , the ability to capture counterintuitive phenomena that have no counterparts in the continuum theories @xcite , as well as the experimental accessibility .",
    "a general non - hermitian tight - binding network is constructed topologically by the sites and the various non - hermitian connections between them .",
    "there are three types of basic non - hermitian clusters leading to the non - hermiticity of a discrete non - hermitian  system : i ) complex on - site potential denoted as @xmath3  with @xmath4  being boson ( fermion ) operator ; ii ) non - hermitian dimer denoted as @xmath5(@xmath6 ) ; iii ) unequal hopping amplitude ( uha ) dimer denoted as @xmath7 with @xmath8 being real numbers .",
    "when @xmath9 , uha dimer reduces to asymmetric hopping amplitude ( aha ) dimer denoted as @xmath10 with asymmetric parameter @xmath11 being real number , which is used in modeling a delocalization phenomenon relevant for the vortex pinning in superconductors @xcite .",
    "the former two types of non - hermitian clusters violate @xmath0 symmetry , while the last one does not .",
    "the systems containing the former two types of clusters have been mainly focused on lattices possessing @xmath12 symmetry and were framed in the context of non - hermitian quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "however , much less attention has been paid to the property of the non - hermitian system with the third type of the cluster .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study the characteristic of the non - hermitian systems with uha dimers , which possess the same properties with a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we show that the system has full real spectrum if all of the eigenvectors have to respect @xmath0-rather than @xmath2-reversal symmetry , and its hermitian counterpart exhibits the same topological structure as that of the original one within the unbroken region . we also find out the behavior of the @xmath13-independent reflectionless transmission ( rt ) for the concerned non - hermitian scattering center under the rt condition .",
    "this is made possible by considering the invisibility of a state in the system with a balanced combination of the reflectionless transmission dimers .",

    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "in order to understand the differences between the characters of an uha dimer with other types of non - hermitian clusters , it is appropriate to begin with the scattering problem for incident plane wave . as is normally done in previous works @xcite , one can embed the scattering center in an infinite lead , which is illustrated schematically in fig .",

    "secondly , the @xmath13-independent hermitian dynamical behavior of the rt non - hermitian scattering center can be applicable to the realization of invisibility in higher dimensional lattice .",
