    "the frobenius trace functions of the @xmath21-adic hypergeometric sheaves are called the `` hypergeometric functions over finite field '' , which gives a generalization of the classical kloosterman sums . moreover",
    ", this function has an intimate connection with the frobenius action on the tale cohomology of a certain class of algebraic varieties ( for example , calabi ",

    "( the hypergeometric function over finite field is also called the `` gaussian hypergeometric function '' by greene @xcite , who independently of katz found this function based on a different motivation . )    the purpose of this article is to develop a @xmath0-adic counterpart of these complex and @xmath21-adic hypergeometric objects .",
    "this @xmath0-adic hypergeometric object will have a presentation which uses ( @xmath0-adic ) differential equation , and at the same time has a frobenius structure .",

    "let @xmath49 be a closed point in @xmath43 if @xmath11 , and in @xmath50 of @xmath14 .",
    "then , the frobenius trace of the overconvergent @xmath2-isocrystal obtained in ( i ) at @xmath49 equals that of the @xmath21-adic hypergeometric sheaf @xmath31 .    in this theorem ,",
    "( i ) states not only that it is a free @xmath51-module of the desired rank , but also that this @xmath1-module satisfies a kind of convergence condition and that it has a frobenius structure . despite the triviality of ( i ) of convolution theorem over @xmath52",
    ", this is therefore a highly non - trivial statement .",
    "another difference from the over-@xmath52 case is that we restricted the parameters to rational coefficients .",
    "we expect that , even for general @xmath0-adic parameters , the arithmetic hypergeometric @xmath1-modules are overconvergent isocrystals ( not necessarily with frobenius structure ) if these parameters satisfy the non - liouville difference condition .",
    "however , since the overholonomicity of arithmetic @xmath1-modules is not preserved by tensor product , our method is not applicable at least verbatim .",
    "we briefly explain the strategy of the proof of main theorem .    we firstly prove ( ii ) . by a similar argument to the theory of @xmath1-module over the complex numbers , the convolution with @xmath53 can be described by using the @xmath0-adic fourier transform of @xmath1-modules `` on @xmath54 '' .",
    "we compare @xmath39 , which is an object `` on @xmath55 '' , with the @xmath1-module `` on @xmath54 '' associated to @xmath56 .",

    "we finally prove ( i ) .",
    "it is an essentially classical result that ( i ) holds for @xmath53 s and @xmath57 s . in particular , they are overholonomic @xmath2-@xmath1-modules . because the property of being an overholonomic @xmath2-@xmath1-module is preserved by six functors as proved by d.  caro , ( ii ) shows that @xmath39 is also an overholonomic @xmath2-@xmath1-module .",
    "an overholonomic @xmath2-@xmath1-module is known to be an overconvergent @xmath2-isocrystal on a dense open subset , but we have to show that it is so on the `` correct '' open subset .",
    "to do this , we use ( iii ) to show that @xmath39 have the desired rank as an @xmath58-module . by combining this result with some properties of @xmath2-isocrystals",
    ", we can finish the proof of ( ii ) .",
    "recently , there appeared an article by crew @xcite , which studies the @xmath0-adic differential equations from the point of view of rigidity .",
    "he proves the existence of the frobenius structure of the regular singular rigid overconvergent isocrystals under suitable conditions .",
    "we note that our main theorem ( i ) in the case where @xmath14 thus proves that the regular singular differential equations as above are examples of the objects which he is dealing with .",
    "there are other studies on the @xmath0-adic hypergeometric equations .",
    "another study by crew @xcite deals with them in the case where @xmath59 , all @xmath60 s are zero , @xmath0 is not divisible by @xmath17 and @xmath61 ; our main theorem ( i ) is proved there in this case . a theorem due to tsuzuki @xcite is applicable to proving the overconvergence and the existence of a frobenius structure for `` picard  fuchs equations '' such as @xmath62 , and we may prove main theorem ( i ) by it in these cases .",
    "our approach is quite different from theirs in the point that we extensively use the multiplicative convolution and systematically deal with general case including these two cases .    at last , we note that the @xmath0-adic theory of hypergeometric functions ( or exponential sums ) are also studied in terms of partial linear differential equations of rank one on a higher dimensional torus , for example by dwork @xcite and adolphson @xcite .    we conclude this introduction by explaining the structure of the article .",
