    "what is the structure of our universe and what governs its evolution ?",
    "extensive cosmological observations have shown that the universe is mostly cold , dark and accelerating ( for a review see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a large fraction of its current ( and possibly future ) energy density may be modeled by an effective negative - pressure fluid named `` dark energy '' . despite intense investigation , the fundamental structure and origin of this fluid is , however , not well understood .",
    "a simple cosmological constant term in einstein s equations provides perhaps the least complicated model of dark energy .",
    "the smallness of the observed cosmological constant poses a theoretical challenge however and no compelling argument for it has been formulated to date .",
    "dynamical models for dark energy have also been proposed : quintessence , k - essence , fermion condensates , phantom , tachyonic , coupled dark matter and dark energy models , to name a few ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "quintessence models introduce scalar fields and postulate specific potentials that can track dark matter and lead to late time accelerated expansion .",
    "k - essence models , originally proposed in the context of inflation , modify the kinetic terms of scalar fields and also lead to accelerated expansion . for some time period",
    "the equation of state of the modified scalar field is the one expected for dark energy . in another class of models , the ( bosonic ) long wavelength excitations of a fermion condensate play the role of a dark energy field .",
    "these excitations are self - interacting and at late times relax to an effective cosmological constant . in phantom field models ,",
    "a scalar field exhibits a `` wrong sign '' kinetic term ; even if the classical dynamics of such a field can be consistent , the fact that the energy of phantom fields is unbounded below makes their vacuum unstable and their quantum theory not well defined unless some mechanism generates a lower bound on their energy .",
    "coupled dark matter and dark energy models postulate certain interaction between ( dark ) matter and the dark energy field and attempt to explain both the observed acceleration as well as the observed similarity of the matter and dark energy densities today . other possible explanations of late - time acceleration , not relying on additional ( fundamental or effective ) scalar fields have also been proposed | such as infrared modifications of general relativity .",
    "all these scenarios , proposed as a consequence of the experimental evidence for dark energy , can be made consistent with observations and constraints ; their place in a more complete theory describing both the evolution of the universe as well as the known particle physics , remains to be clarified .",
    "the standard model of particle physics explains successfully all collider and other experimental data ; it nevertheless has many theoretical shortcomings and it is presently seen only as a good effective theory that requires a high energy completion .",
    "many possible extensions of the standard model have been proposed , addressing specific difficulties of the standard model .",
    "some of these models , while motivated by particle physics issues , provide good candidates for dark matter .",
    "it seems natural to expect that a compelling solution to both the cosmological observations and particle physics issues should exist in the context of a more fundamental theory .",
    "one of the proposed ways for embedding the standard model in string theory is by making it part of a quiver gauge theory  _ i.e. _ a theory with many gauge groups and fields transforming either in the adjoint representation or in the bi - fundamental representation of these groups .",
    "such theories may be realized ( either directly or holographically ) @xcite in terms of d - branes placed at various types of singular points .",
    "the additional gauge groups are either broken at a sufficiently high scale or are decoupled from the standard model by appropriate choices for the relevant coupling constants or other parameters concerning the details of the compactification to four dimensions .",
    "such decoupled sectors nevertheless affect the observable physics through gravitational interactions | either through higher - dimension plank - suppressed operators or by playing the role of dark matter ( if the excitations of these sectors are sufficiently massive ) or dark energy ( if the excitations of these sectors are sufficiently light or even massless ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study such decoupled theories from this perspective .",
    "all scalar fields present in these theories transform in nontrivial representations of the gauge group making them not directly suitable for dark matter or dark energy candidates . in this paper",
    "we will discuss a class of quantum field theories which may appear in such a scenario .",
    "they are conformally invariant at the classical level but no longer so at the quantum level .",
    "conformal invariance will be broken in an interesting way which will allow us to gain all - order information about the theory and identify the relevant gauge singlet(s ) that can play the role of a dark energy field .",
    "further motivation for analyzing theories of the type outlined above is the proposal @xcite to embed the standard model itself in a conformal field theory . in this scenario , at some ( high ) energy scale particle physics is governed by a non - supersymmetric conformal field theory . sometimes such theories have unexpected features ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) whose phenomenological consequences are worthwhile exploring .    from a string theory perspective these theories may be realized in terms of a stack of d3 branes probing non - supersymmetric @xmath1 orbifold singularities ; they are quiver gauge theories with @xmath2 nodes .",
    "fields transforming in the adjoint representation are realized by strings connecting branes in the same stack while fields in the bifundamental representation are the lowest lying modes of strings connecting the images under the action of the orbifold group .",
    "one may extend such construction by adding further d7 branes ; apart from matter in the fundamental representation of the quiver gauge group ( which is realized by d3-d7 strings ) , such a construction naturally adds gravitationally - coupled gauge singlets .",
    "regardless whether the quiver gauge theory is interpreted as a hidden sector ( as we do in this paper ) or if it is broken to the standard model , these additional fields may be suitable dark matter candidates .",
    "in the next section we will briefly describe a class of non - supersymmetric models in which conformal symmetry is broken dynamically ; due to the special properties of their renormalization group flow , these theories can reach a regime in which they simplify dramatically , their entire dynamics being governed by a simple matrix scalar quantum field theory . in ",
    "3 we will describe a curved space version of this model and construct an equivalent model whose fields are singlets under the gauge symmetry of the original model and thus may play the role of a dark energy field .",
    "the cosmological implications of this model will be discussed in  4 .",
    "we present our conclusions and further comments in  5 .",
    "quiver gauge theories have long been subject of active investigation .",
    "if the gauge groups are of @xmath3 type , the action possesses a variety of double - trace terms required by the absence of the @xmath4 factors .",
    "these double - trace terms renormalize independently of the single - trace part of the action . if the coupling constant of the single - trace part of the action is fixed , the double - trace coupling runs without bound at low energies implying that , in some regime , the double - trace operators dominate the dynamics of the theory .",
    "this scenario is realized in certain nonsupersymmetric theories in the multi - color limit , such as orbifold theories and non - supersymmetric @xmath5-deformed theories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the former theories , which will be our main interest in the following , is obtained from [ neq4action ] l_0 = -(||n)by an orbifold projection by a discrete group @xmath6 . here",
    "the gauge group is @xmath7 , the trace is normalized such that the identity element of the gauge group has trace equal to @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the t  hooft coupling constant , @xmath10 are six real scalar fields transforming in the vector representation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the @xmath11 dirac matrices . as usual ,",
    "covariant derivatives describe the coupling with the gauge field and are proportional to a single power of the coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "four fermions , not shown in equation  ( [ neq4action ] ) , transforming in the spinor representation of @xmath11 and having yukawa couplings with the scalars , complete the action .",
    "we will denote by @xmath14 the representation of the elements of @xmath15 in @xmath7 , where they act by conjugation and by @xmath16 and @xmath17 the representation of @xmath15 in the spinor and vector representation of @xmath11 , respectively . @xmath18 and @xmath16",
    "are not unrelated ; if one presents the vector representation of @xmath11 as the 2-index antisymmetric tensor representation of @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .",
    "the orbifold projection retains in the action ( [ neq4action ] ) only the components of the original fields obeying the following relations : @xmath21 moreover , the overall factor of @xmath15 disappears and the t  hooft coupling of the orbifolded theory is @xmath22 .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of this construction is for @xmath23 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath24 ) ; its nontrivial element acts as g = diag(*1*_n,-*1*_n )   r_g=-*1*_4   r_g = * 1*_6 inside the original @xmath25 gauge group , and on the spinor and vector representations of @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the resulting theory @xcite contains two @xmath26 gauge groups , 6 scalar fields transforming in the adjoint representation of the first group , 6 scalar fields transforming in the adjoint representation of the second group , 4 fermions transforming in the bifundamental @xmath27 and 4 fermions transforming in the bifundamental @xmath28 .",
    "the single - trace part of such orbifold theories has been analyzed in detail in @xcite where it was shown that these terms are inherited from the parent theory ; in the case of the action ( [ neq4action ] ) ( together with its fermionic completion ) they are finite .",
    "as we previously mentioned however , the action contains additional double - trace terms @xcite which receive nontrivial infinite renormalization . for the simple @xmath23 example they are _ 0 = -f_20o^ijo_ij - f_0 o^2 [ egdouble ] with o^ij=-   o=  .",
    "such double - trace terms are generic in orbifold field theories and may always be traced to certain twisted auxiliary fields ; they are not protected from renormalization by the general arguments of @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , they are in fact required by the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath29 of a double - trace operator @xmath30 runs at 1-loop as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the t  hooft coupling , @xmath33 is the 2-point function coefficient of the operator @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath34 and @xmath36 is the contribution of the single - trace lagrangian to the @xmath5-function of the double - trace coupling . if the discriminant d=^2_o-4",
    "v_o a_o>0 then @xmath37 has a nontrivial zero and @xmath29 will flow to it .",
    "some supersymmetry appears to be required @xcite for such nontrivial zeroes .",
    "if supersymmetry is completely broken , as in the @xmath38 model described above , there exists at least one double - trace coupling whose discriminant @xmath39 is negative , leading to the following running coupling : @xmath40 here we defined @xmath41 and , for simplicity , the chosen boundary condition is @xmath42 .",
    "thus , at weak ",
    "t hooft coupling @xmath43 , the double - trace parameter @xmath29 varies very slowly for a wide range of scales .",
    "still , it blows up towards positive infinity in the uv at @xmath44 and reaches @xmath45 in the ir at @xmath46 .",
    "corrections , which introduce a positive beta function for @xmath43 , making it approach zero in the ir .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the large @xmath47 limit .",
    "] this unexpected runaway behavior of the coupling @xmath29 was interpreted @xcite in terms of a tachyonic instability of the string theory dual .",
    "this is however not problematic as it has been argued from several different standpoints @xcite that the energy dynamically becomes bounded from below and the theory may flow to a nontrivial ir fixed point .",
    "regardless the value of the t  hooft coupling @xmath43 , the double - trace coupling @xmath29 becomes larger than @xmath43 at some finite energy scale and thus the double - trace terms will dominate the dynamics of this theory around those energy scales . in this regime",
    "then , the double - trace deformed orbifold field theory action effectively simplifies to a bosonic matrix field theory with a quartic double - trace potential .",
    "while in general there will be several double - trace terms that have the features described above , the one with the largest coupling constant will be most relevant . including the other terms",
    "may be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the expectation following from this analysis is that along this flow , the twisted dimension-2 single - trace operators appearing in the double - trace operators that are generated quantum mechanically as illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ egdouble ] ) acquire nontrivial vacuum expectation values .",
    "to capture this effect and describe the consequences of this process it is therefore necessary to evaluate the effective potential for these operators ; from the standpoint of the orbifold theory this is a multi - trace effective potential , the dimension-2n term having n traces .",
    "the explicit calculations of @xcite show that the only effect of 1-loop corrections in the orbifold action without double - trace operators is to generate double - trace operators .",
    "all other possible terms are forbidden either by the analysis of @xcite or are derivative terms .",
    "the addition of double - trace operators to the tree - level action renders the theory renormalizable .",
    "it is not difficult to see that in this deformed theory , all n - trace terms generated at 1-loop level receive contributions _",
    "solely _ from the double - trace deformation for all @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for the purpose of finding the multi - trace effective potential .",
    "we may dispense with the large set of fields of the orbifold action and capture the dynamics of scalar fields by considering a much simpler action  that of a purely bosonic matrix scalar field theory with a specific quartic double - trace potential . to capture the effects of the ignored gluons and",
    "fermions all one needs to do is to renormalize the divergences and use as running coupling that of the orbifold theory ( [ expsol ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that , as a twisted operator develops a vacuum expectation value , the potential of the undeformed orbifold theory becomes nonvanishing as well .",
    "this constant , which is positive and of the order of the square of the vacuum expectation value of the twisted operator , should also be added to the effective potential .",
    "while in general there will be several double - trace terms that have the features described above , one may focus on the one whose coupling constant runs fastest .",
    "this is the case because , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ expsol ] ) , the runaway behavior  and therefore the appearance of nontrivial vacuum expectation value for a twisted operator  sets in first for this operator . including the other double - trace terms",
    "may be treated as a perturbation and the running of their coupling constant will likely be affected by the emerging vacuum expectation value of the leading twisted operator .",
    "it is not always clear which orbifold group element generates the dominant double - trace term ; we will generically denote this element by @xmath49 as we will not need its detailed properties .",
    "it is however typically the case @xcite that the operator whose coupling constant runs fastest is constructed out of @xmath11 singlets .",
    "thus , the action we will be interested in is just = - n - f ( m)||^2 [ ini ] where without loss of generality we kept only two of the six scalar fields and have organized them into complex combinations .    while simpler than the original orbifold action , the action ( [ ini ] ) is still complicated mainly due to the existence of the matrix degrees of freedom .",
    "its vacuum structure and , as we will see in the next section , its gravitational effects , may be described in terms of a simpler theory containing a single scalar field to which it is completely equivalent .",
    "this is a standard approach : we introduce an auxiliary field that linearizes the quartic interaction l =- n^ + -- | [ waux ] and construct the 1-particle - irreducible effective action of this field .",
    "this action contains the complete quantum information about the original theory regardless of the size of the expectation value of the auxiliary field @xmath50 ( it is , in fact not clear a priori that such an expectation value is generated at all ) ) the 1pi effective action is 1-loop exact .",
    "this is , however , not the case for the orbifold theory which is the motivation for this discussion and therefore we will not use this fact in the following . ] .",
    "all higher - point potential interactions of the original scalar field @xmath51 that are generated at the quantum level are encoded in the higher - point interactions of the auxiliary field .",
    "this construction replaces the scalar field @xmath51 carrying gauge degrees of freedom by a single gauge - invariant effective field which may in principle be observable , albeit only gravitationally coupled with the standard model in the setup discussed here .    the scalar theory ( [ ini ] ) encodes , through the scale dependence of the coupling constant @xmath52 , the effects of the truncated fields on the dynamics of the scalar field appearing in the twisted operator .",
    "the reverse effects  _",
    "i.e. _ the effects of the scalar field evolution on the gauge fields , fermions and the other scalars  are ignored . at sufficiently low energies ,",
    "when the vacuum expectation value of the twisted operator ( or , alternatively , for the auxiliary field @xmath50 ) becomes comparable to the energy scale , this back - reaction can no longer be ignored .",
    "accounting for it is crucial for the arguments @xcite that the theory flows to a nontrivial ir fixed point .",
    "heuristically , around this energy scale , parts of the gauge fields , fermions and scalars become sufficiently massive and no longer contribute to the rg coefficients and a nontrivial beta function for the gauge coupling is generated . consequently",
    ", the running of the double - trace coupling ( [ genbeta ] ) will be supplemented by the running of the gauge coupling and the resulting system is expected to no longer have a runaway solution . on symmetry grounds ,",
    "the fixed point theory is not expected to depend on the vacuum expectation value of the twisted operators , which is therefore irrelevant in a flat space setup . in curved space",
    "however , the vacuum expectation value sources gravitational field and its gravitational effects will not change qualitatively along the rg flow of the complete theory .",
    "in general , the orbifold field theory ( [ neq4action])-([projection ] ) as well as the reduced model ( [ ini ] ) are symmetric under the discrete transformation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a root of unity of the appropriate order to keep @xmath55 an element of the orbifold group .",
    "introduction of the auxiliary field does not break this symmetry which is preserved if the auxiliary field transforms as @xmath56 , as may be readily seen from equation ( [ waux ] ) .",
    "this symmetry constrains the 1pi effective action to be solely a function of @xmath57 ; in particular , tadpole - like terms linear in @xmath50 or @xmath58 are forbidden .",
    "the potential for the auxiliary field typically has a nontrivial minimum @xcite , which translates into a nontrivial vacuum expectation value for the twisted operator @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this can be translated into a nontrivial expectation value for the scalar fields .",
    "such expectation values have two distinct effects : ( a ) they may yield a nonzero positive value for the tree - level potential and ( b ) at 1-loop they contribute a positive constant term to the potential .",
    "in flat space both contributions are , of course , irrelevant .",
    "the details of these contributions depend on the details of the orbifold group .    in the next section",
    "we will place the model discussed here in curved space .",
    "one may find that a finite density of @xmath51 quanta is created ( in a gauge - invariant configurations ) ; to account for this possibility we also add a chemical potential .",
    "a systematic way of accounting for this is to add the number operator to the hamiltonian which is then transformed to a lagrangian framework . since the auxiliary field @xmath50 linearized the quartic interaction , the behavior of the resulting field theory in the presence of a chemical potential is quite analogous to the zero temperature limit of an ideal relativistic bose gas .",
    "classically , the fields @xmath51 are massless with the interaction terms playing the role of an effective mass . at the quantum level",
    "the auxiliary fields @xmath60 and @xmath58 acquire nontrivial vacuum expectation values , justifying this interpretation .    unlike systems of fermions , in the zero temperature limit the chemical potential does not enter explicitly the expression of the bosonic partition function .",
    "rather , it is determined separately from the requirement that all particles are found in the ground state .",
    "if @xmath61 is the ground state energy ( i.e. the effective mass of the @xmath51 particles ) then the chemical potential is determined by the particle number density in the ground state : in general it is not possible to give different interpretations to the modes of a field depending on their energy .",
    "however , modes with specified spatial momenta of any one field are a set of measure zero in the path integral . due to the contribution of the integration measure , @xmath62 modes with vanishing spatial momenta make vanishing contributions to the 1-loop grand potential in the continuum limit . in a theory placed in finite volume one may isolate the contribution of the lowest energy mode .",
    "its contribution is volume independent and thus subleading for large / infinite spatial volume which is the case for an frw universe or in minkowski space .",
    "fothis is a standard approach which is used extensively in the treatment of bose condensation ; its advantage is that it allows particles to dynamically condense to the ground state or leave the condensate .",
    "however , the ground state condensate should not , in our case , be described as a classical field . from equation ( [ waux ] ) it is clear that the auxiliary field @xmath50 acts as effective mass for the fields @xmath51 .",
    "as we will see in later sections , the auxiliary field acquires generically a nontrivial expectation value thus rendering @xmath51 effectively massive .",
    "this effective mass is the ground state energy .",
    "any translational momenta for the ground state quanta will raise their energy and this take them out of the ground state .",
    "we should also note that , since they have vanishing momenta , _ in flat space _ the ground state particles do not contribute directly to the effective potential for the auxiliary field , their contribution being cancelled by the integration measure . ]",
    "n=   = _ 0+_0 .",
    "the standard relation between the grand potential and the partition function yields then the energy density as = _",
    "t0(-ktz ) + n .",
    "[ edensity ] one can easily see that the first term is nothing but the zero temperature field theory partition function to be obtained from the action ( [ ini ] ) .",
    "it is also the @xmath63 component of the auxiliary field stress tensor constructed from the quantum effective action .",
    "thus , a simple way to include a finite @xmath51 density at zero temperature is to add a pressureless stress tensor with @xmath64 to the stress tensor of the auxiliary field @xmath50",
    ".    clearly , such an addition manifestly breaks conformal invariance . from the standpoint of the orbifold theory ,",
    "for which ( [ ini ] ) is only a model capturing its essentia features , all violations of conformal invariance occur only quantum mechanically and are proportional to the beta - function of the double - trace operator ( in a cosmological setting further effects proportional to the hubble constant may also occur ) .",
    "for this reason one may expect that the particle - number density @xmath2 is small ; while we keep it throughout the general analysis , we will set it to zero when exploring the cosmological consequences of our model .    in the next section",
    "we will discuss the curved space version of the quantum field theory detailed above and compute its partition function .",
    "it will turn out that , with a suitable choice of variables , the curved space calculation can be easily mapped to a flat space calculation .",
    "the effective model we identified in the previous section captures the features of a quantum field theory whose only departure from scale invariance is encoded in the running of a certain double - trace coupling constant @xmath29 . in coupling it to gravity",
    "we would like to preserve this feature ; to this end , apart from the standard covariantization of index contraction , we will also add a conformal coupling , @xmath65 , for the scalar fields @xmath51",
    ". ensures scale invariance . ]",
    "l= ( - ng^ - r - f ||^2 ) [ iniscalar ] where , as before , @xmath66 is an element of the orbifold group @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the ricci scalar .",
    "similarly to the flat space theory , we proceed by linearizing the dependence on @xmath51 by introducing auxiliary fields : l= ( -ng^- r + -- | )  .",
    "scale invariance implies that a rescaling of the metric @xmath69 can be absorbed by a field redefinition . in conformal time , an frw metric is just that of minkowski space up to a scale factor @xmath70 .",
    "the presence of the conformal coupling then implies that this scale factor can be eliminated by a field redefinition .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that in terms of the new fields = a ( )  = a()^2the action is exactly that of the original minkowsky space theory : l =- n + -- | .",
    "this is a reflection of the scale invariance of ( [ iniscalar ] ) .",
    "the scalar fields @xmath71 appear quadratically .",
    "therefore the 1pi effective potential may be easily computed by evaluating the determinant of the operator k_b = -^__+^-1 +  ,  v_&= & i k_b  . on general grounds",
    "this determinant has both power - like and logarithmic uv divergences .",
    "these divergences may however be traced to the fact that we are focusing on the dynamics of the fields @xmath51 and are ignoring the other fields .",
    "if a quadratic divergence were present , it would generate a tadpole for @xmath72 ; in the complete orbifold theory such a term would suggest a perturbative generation of a mass term for some component of @xmath51 at two loops .",
    "this however is not expected to happen in the large @xmath47 limit @xcite , consistent with the cancellation of terms linear in @xmath72 .",
    "we will therefore discard quadratic divergences from our effective model .    with this clarifications , and if there exists a choice of fields @xmath72 and analytic continuation of momenta such that @xmath73 does not have zero eigenvalues , the loop - induced potential for the auxiliary fields @xmath72 and @xmath74 is just v _ & = & [ cw ] with = ( ^-1+| )  .",
    "here we carried out the trace over momenta ; the remaining trace is only over the gauge group indices . in the complete theory",
    "the logarithmic divergence present in equation ( [ cw ] ) contributes to the running of the coupling constant @xmath29 through the coefficient @xmath33 in the @xmath5-function ( [ genbeta ] ) .",
    "after renormalization the cutoff scale @xmath75 is replaced with the renormalization scale @xmath76 .    for a @xmath77 orbifold , the coleman - weinberg potential ( [ cw ] ) is : v_&= & _ k=0^n + m_k&=&_k+_k^*|  _",
    "k^n=1  _ k_k^*=1  ,    in the calculation above @xmath78 maintains its role as a non - dynamical field as it was assumed to be constant throughout the calculation .",
    "it is however easy to see that derivative terms are also generated at the quantum level .",
    "they may be organized following the number of fields on which the derivatives act . to this end one",
    "separates @xmath79 into a constant part and a position / momentum - dependent part and expands in the latter .",
    "the terms in which no derivatives act on the momentum - dependent part of @xmath79 may be resummed and lead to a trivial shift of the constant part of @xmath79 .",
    "this is similar to doing perturbation theory around an arbitrary value of @xmath72 .",
    "while in general this would manifest an instability , this is not the case here because at tree level any value of @xmath72 is allowed ( alternatively , because the potential for @xmath72 is generated at the same order as the derivative terms ) . with the same assumption as before , that momenta may be analytically continued",
    "such that for fixed fields @xmath73 does not have zero eigenvalues , the first correction , containing two derivatives , is given by=0 $ ] .",

    "regardless of its precise expression , the meaning of this term from the standpoint of the original theory is that of an effective contribution to the 4-point scalar amplitude . following a strategy similar to the above it is not difficult to find higher - derivative corrections . we will however refrain from writing general expressions here",
    "the simplest example illustrating the discussion in the previous section is the @xmath38 orbifold theory , _",
