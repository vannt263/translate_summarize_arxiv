    "the recent years d - brane configurations with @xmath0 gauge symmetry have been systematically investigated and extensively analyzed  @xcite-@xcite , particularly in the context of intersecting d - branes . this gauge symmetry could be considered as the natural successor of the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath1 in the context of d - branes . the constant endeavors to examine the low energy implications of the emerging effective low energy theory during the last few years",
    "have been absolutely justified , as many of these efforts were crowned with considerable progress towards a successful d - brane realization of the sm gauge group with its chiral and higgs matter content .    in the intersecting d - brane constructions",
    "the sm chiral matter arises in the intersection of the brane - stacks wrapping three cycles in the internal six - dimensional manifold .",
    "wrapping branes on a compact manifold intersect each other , while the number of fermion fields equals the number of intersections , a fact that eventually reveals a possible geometrical origin of the fermion family multiplicity .",
    "the emerging effective field theory model usually consists of the sm gauge symmetry augmented by some global @xmath2 symmetries , with the minimal fermion and higgs spectrum escorted ( in several cases ) by some additional -hopefully innocuous- matter representations .",
    "one of the main shortcomings of these constructions is the absence of several yukawa couplings necessary to provide all quark and lepton fields with non - zero masses .",
    "indeed , a generic feature in d - brane constructions is that ordinary matter fields are charged under the aforementioned global @xmath2 symmetries accompanying the sm gauge group .",
    "undoubtedly , these symmetries impose additional restrictions ( beyond those of the sm gauge symmetry ) on the perturbative yukawa superpotential terms and as a consequence , some of the sm fermion fields remain massless .",
    "it was shown that these global @xmath2 s are broken from stringy instantons effects @xcite and as a consequence new , non - perturbative contributions can be generated to the superpotential . in type",
    "iia compactifications in particular , the eventual candidates are the euclidean d2 instantons ( subsequently called @xmath3 instantons for short ) wrapping three cycles in the internal manifold . if they are chosen to intersect with the relevant d6-branes appropriate number of times , there exist inextricable superpotential terms filling in the zeros of the fermion mass matrices . compared to the perturbative yukawa couplings , the instanton induced terms appear to be suppressed by the exponential of the classical instanton action @xmath4 .",
    "these corrections although subdominant with respect to the tree - level perturbative yukawa couplings , might prove of vital importance as far as the viability of the construction is concerned . indeed , in the class of models under consideration",
    ", these instanton induced terms could offer a natural explanation for the observed hierarchy of the fermion mass spectrum , acting as a surrogate for missing non - renormalizable terms of the perturbative sector .    in the present work we will examine the stringy instanton effects in the case of a minimal d - brane set - up required to embed the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "this configuration consists of three brane - stacks leading to @xmath5 gauge symmetry with the ordinary quarks and lepton fields living in their intersections .",
    "it was shown that three different fermion embeddings are possible@xcite , while , due to the minimal structure of this configuration some particular cases can be naturally embedded in higher unified symmetries such as the @xmath6  @xcite , the trinification  @xcite or the pati - salam@xcite d - brane analogue@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly present the derivation of the model from the particular d - brane set - up and give a short description of its embedding in the intersecting d - brane scenario .",
    "we introduce the chiral and higgs spectrum and emphasize the salient features of the model , including the unification prospects and the perturbative superpotential structure for several choices of the matter content . in section 3 ,",
    "we recapitulate the basic procedure on the derivation  @xcite of the stringy instanton non - perturbative yukawa couplings and apply the results to the specific d - brane construction analyzed in this work .",
    "we derive the non - perturbative contributions for the quark and neutrino mass matrices and comment on the peculiar nature of the resulting yukawa textures .",
    "a separate discussion is devoted to the attractive dirac neutrino mass matrix texture in section 4 and emphasis is given in a specific example which reconciles the experimental data .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "we start this section with a brief description of the simplest model constructed by the minimum possible number of brane - stacks .",
    "the sm embedding in a d - brane configuration has received much attention the last decade and attempts to reproduce its spectrum and low energy successful reconciliation with all the known experimental data has stimulated a thorough investigation of the configurations with several sets of brane - stacks leading to the enhanced sm symmetry u(3)u(2)u(1)^nsu(3)su(2)u(1)^n+2g_sm [ esm ] the integer power @xmath7 represents the number of @xmath2 branes needed to reproduce the desired sm spectrum while a linear combination of the @xmath8 abelian factors will accommodate the hypercharge generator . )",
    "we can observe that due to the group relation @xmath9 , one might assume that the sm gauge symmetry could be generated with only the two brane stacks @xmath10 , so we could take @xmath11 .",
    "it can be easily shown that the hypercharge generator can not be expressed only in terms of these two @xmath2 symmetries , so we need @xmath12 . ]",
    "sm matter fields are ` incarnated ' through open strings with their endpoints on the intersecting d6-branes and are localized in the intersection locus of the latter . in type iia orientifolds the following types of representations arise :    open strings appearing in the intersection locus of two @xmath13 branes ( @xmath14 for short ) ` create ' bifundamental representations @xmath15 while their multiplicity is given by the number of intersections i_ab&=&_i=1",

    "chiral fermions appear also in @xmath20 representations from the intersections of a @xmath18 brane - stack with a mirror brane @xmath21 .",
    "their number is given by i_ab^*&=&-_i=1 ^ 3(m_ai n_bi+m_bi n_ai)[ab ] states arising in the intersection of a @xmath18-brane with its corresponding mirror one , may belong to the antisymmetric or symmetric representations .",
    "those which remain invariant under the combined @xmath22 action belong to the antisymmetric representations of the @xmath23 gauge group and their multiplicity ( denoted as @xmath24 ) is given by i_aa^*^a&=&8m_a1m_a2m_a3[asym ] depending on the specific winding numbers , there may also appear symmetric and antisymmetric representations with equal multiplicities ^a , s_aa^*&=&4m_a1m_a2m_a3 ( n_a1n_a2 n_a3 - 1)[sym ] finally , additional restrictions are imposed on the @xmath25 sets originating from the @xmath26-type tadpole conditions which read : t_0=_an_an_a1n_a2n_a3=16 & , & t_i=_an_an_aim_ajm_ak=0,ijki[tc ] where the indices @xmath27 take the values @xmath28 and refer to the three torii @xmath29 .    returning to ( [ esm ] ) , we have already asserted that the three sm gauge factors need at least three brane - stacks , however , if one insists to accommodate the sm fermions only in bifundamentals , then one should take at least @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "if , for the sake of simplicity and ` economy ' one uses the possible minimal brane set - up , i.e. when @xmath31 , some of the fermions are accommodated in bifundamentals obtained in the intersections of two different brane - stacks , while others are accommodated in antisymmetric or symmetric representations which can be created by strings with endpoints on a given brane - stack and its corresponding mirror . as mentioned above , there are three distinct arrangements of the sm - fields ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and here we concentrate on the configuration depicted in figure [ f1 ] .    a depiction of the @xmath5 d - brane configuration with strings representing the sm states . for the sake of simplicity ,",

    "thus , the blue string representing the quark doublet @xmath33 is stretched between the @xmath18 and the mirror @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , one endpoint of the `` @xmath35-string '' is attached on the mirror @xmath36.,scaledwidth=28.0% ]    for later convenience we call @xmath32 the stacks related to @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "we start exploring the model implementing the minimal fermion and higgs spectrum of our particular d - brane set - up which is shown in table [ u321 ] .",
    "this consists of the three sm fermion generations , their corresponding right handed neutrinos and one pair of higgs doublets .",
    ".the quantum numbers of the sm fermions in the @xmath38 brane configuration .",
    "the last column is the hypercharge @xmath39 while three previous ones refer to the @xmath2 charges with respect to the @xmath32 brane - stacks.[u321 ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     taking into account the fields of table [ t2 ] , the following tree - level yukawa terms should be included to the superpotential &=&_j^uqu_j^ch_u+_j^dq_pd^c_jh_d + _ij^l_i^c_jh_u [ spprime ] these new terms are sufficient to provide the missing entries in the quark mass matrices and generate the dirac - type neutrino masses .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the introduction of the second neutrino supermultiplet allows for an alternative option .",
    "it can be seen that the following fourth order non - renormalizable terms are permitted by the sm gauge and the three global @xmath2 symmetries qu_j^ch_u^c+q_pd^c_jh_d^c[newy ] assuming a vacuum expectation value to a combination @xmath40 of the scalar partners @xmath41 we observe that both terms are contributing to the zero entries of the quark mass matrices . in this case one",
    "dispenses with the use of the second higgs pair , since in the new couplings ( [ newy ] ) only the first pair of higgs fields participates .",
    "this second choice however , discriminates between the tree - level entries ( [ sp ] ) and the new contributions ( [ newy ] ) in the mass matrices , since the latter are suppressed relative to the first by the factor @xmath42 and considerable adjustment of the parameters is needed to derive the observed quark mass hierarchy .    next , instead of expanding the chiral and higgs spectrum , as a second alternative , we consider stringy instantons and take into account their induced non - perturbative contributions to the perturbative superpotential ( [ sp ] ) . as in the case of the non - renormalizable terms ( [ newy ] ) , these corrections are also expected to be suppressed relative to the tree - level entries , the suppression factor being now proportional to the exponential of the volume of the cycle wrapped by the instanton in the internal manifold .",
    "we analyze these issues in the next section .",
    "we have already realized that the d - brane embedding of the sm implies additional restrictions on the yukawa superpotential due to the presence of the three @xmath43 abelian symmetries . as a consequence ,",
    "a number of useful yukawa couplings crucial for the fermion mass terms are absent at the tree level of the perturbative sector .    in general ,",
    "if @xmath44 represent superfields generated in the intersection of @xmath45 brane - stacks , it is possible that the coupling @xmath46 although invariant with respect to the non - abelian part of the gauge symmetry , might violate some abelian global @xmath47 factor .    it has been recently suggested  @xcite that in viable models ,",
    "the missing tree - level yukawa couplings could be generated from non - perturbative effects .",
    "in particular , considering @xmath3 instantons in type iia string theory having appropriate number of intersections with the @xmath45-branes , a non - perturbative term _",
    "n.p.&&_j=1^j_a_jb_je^-s_e[instcoup ] is induced , where the instanton action @xmath48 can absorb the @xmath47 charge excess of the matter fields operator @xmath46 .",
    "the global @xmath47 charges carried by the instanton action have their microscopic origin in the extra fermionic zero modes living in the intersection of the @xmath3-brane with the @xmath18 brane - stack . under the aforementioned abelian symmetry the transformation property of the exponential instanton action is e^-s_e&&e^-s_ee^q_a(e2)_a where @xmath49 represents the amount of the @xmath47-charge violation by the @xmath3 instanton . for an instanton wrapping appropriate number of cycles ,",
    "this can be made exactly opposite to the total charge of the operator @xmath46 , so the coupling ( [ instcoup ] ) is also @xmath47-invariant .",
    "besides , the induced coupling ( [ instcoup ] ) involves an exponential suppression by the classical instanton action @xmath50 which , as can be seen depends on the volume vol@xmath51 of the cycle wrapped by the instanton and is inversely proportional to the perturbative string gauge coupling @xmath52 .",
    "it is expected that even in the case of small @xmath53 , string instanton contributions might become relevant .    in computing these non - perturbative effects",
    "the important ingredients are the instanton fermionic zero modes .",
    "we distinguish two different classes of them with respect to the charge they carry under the abelian gauge factors . in one class",
    "there are two uncharged fermionic zero modes @xmath54 with both endpoints attached on the @xmath3 instanton and they correspond to the two broken supersymmetries . in a second class",
    "are classified all the charged fermionic zero modes which are of primary importance in the computation of the instanton effects .",
    "these appear in the intersection of the @xmath3 instanton with a certain @xmath18 brane - stack , while their relevance to a specific superpotential coupling is related to the number of @xmath55 intersections .",
    "in particular , the crucial quantity which appears in the coupling ( [ instcoup ] ) is the charge @xmath49 which is related to the @xmath3 intersections with the @xmath45 brane stacks as follows .",
    "the @xmath3 instanton brane is considered wrapping a homological three - cycle @xmath56 in the internal manifold , while is localized in the four - dimensional space - time .",
    "if @xmath57 are the homological three - cycles of the @xmath18 brane - stack and its mirror respectively , then _ a(e2)&=&-n_a_e(_a-_a^*)-n_a ( i_ea - i_ea^*)[instcha ] where the @xmath58 and @xmath59 stand for the relevant intersection numbers . in what follows , we will consider a class of rigid @xmath60 instantons , wrapping a rigid orientifold - invariant cycle in the internal space , where due to the @xmath61 and @xmath62 identification the charge ( [ instcha ] ) simplifies to _ a(e2)&=&-n_a_e_a - n_a i_ea[e2d6 ] assuming appropriate number of wrappings , it is possible to cancel exactly the @xmath47 charge excess and make the desired coupling invariant .",
    "returning to the specific model discussed in this work , we can check from ( [ sp ] ) that there are several missing superpotential couplings , including those for the up- and down quarks and the right - handed majorana neutrino masses .",
    "the absence of these terms make the model rather unrealistic at the perturbative level .",
    "we will see that instanton contributions do play a vital role on the issues of viability and phenomenological consistency of this construction .",
    "we start with the up quark coupling @xmath63 which , as can be observed , violates the @xmath64 charge by two units @xmath65 and therefore can not exist at tree - level . assuming a @xmath3 instanton intersecting with the @xmath66 brane - stack , so that _ b(e2)&= & -n_b i_eb we conclude that @xmath67 eliminates the charge - excess and the relevant coupling is allowed .",
    "the intersections of @xmath3 with the relevant branes is depicted in fig [ f1 ] . at the computational level",
    ", one has to integrate over all instanton zero modes , the path integral being \\{d^4xd^2d^2_b}e^-s_ey_j^u _ mn_r<_b^mq^nu^c_jh_u^r_b^*^s > e^z[intqu ] the integration ( [ intqu ] ) is over the four bosonic @xmath68 and two fermionic @xmath69 zero modes as well as the two instanton modes @xmath70 .",
    "further there is an overall exponential suppression of the instanton action which makes the coupling invariant and @xmath71 in the regularized one - loop amplitude .",
    "finally , @xmath72 are @xmath73 indices , while @xmath74 is a coupling constant with @xmath75 running over all family indices . clearly , the above instanton induced terms contribute to the zeros of the up - quark matrices presented in the previous section .",
    "stringy instanton contributions to the up - quark yukawa mass matrix.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    we turn now our attention to the down quark mass matrix .",
    "the trilinear couplings @xmath76 violate the @xmath64 charge by two units @xmath77 , hence this term is also forbidden in the perturbative superpotential . in an analogous manner with the up - quark case",
    "discussed above , we introduce here a second instanton @xmath78 which intersects with @xmath66 and @xmath34 brane - stacks , so that @xmath79 , with @xmath80 .",
    "an integration over the instanton zero modes as in the case of ( [ intqu ] ) will lead to the effective instanton induced down quark yukawa coupling @xmath76 , suppressed by analogous exponential factors .",
    "summarizing , the non - perturbative contributions to quark mass matrices induced by string instantons are _",
    "n.p.&=&^u_jqu^c_jh_u+^d_pjq_pd^c_jh_d[npq ] where the couplings @xmath81 and @xmath81 are suppressed compared to the perturbative ones , due to the exponential factors involving the classical instanton action . taking into account the non - perturbative contributions the mass matrices obtain the following texture form m_q= (    lll _ 11^u & _ 12^u & _ 13^u + _ 21^u & _ 22^u & _ 23^u + _1^u & _2^u & _3^u    ) h_u,&&m_d= (    lll _11^d & _12^d & _13^d + _21^d & _22^d & _23^d + _ 31^d & _ 32^d & _",
    "33^d    ) h_dand analogously for the other two cases ( [ ca2],[ca3 ] ) .",
    "we should point out that in general , fermion mass textures as those above are rather unusual and considerable adjustment is needed to obtain the known up and down quark mass hierarchies .",
    "the rather striking fact however , is that since the non - perturbative couplings are suppressed by factors of the form @xmath82 , relative to the perturbative ones , the quark mass ratios are directly correlated to the geometry of the internal manifold .",
    "the experimental evidence of non - zero neutrino masses and mixing urges for a rather profound extension of the standard model , i.e. , the introduction of the right - handed neutrino .",
    "this makes possible the implementation of the attractive see - saw mechanism in order to resolve the puzzle of the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "we have seen that in the present d - brane construction , the right - handed neutrino can arise from an open string whose one endpoint is attached on the @xmath83 ( i.e. @xmath66 ) brane - stack and the other on its corresponding mirror brane - stack obtained under the orientifold action @xmath84 . under the charge assignment of table 1 a dirac mass term for the neutrino is not allowed at the perturbative superpotential .",
    "the right - handed neutrino however , is an electrically neutral singlet , while the @xmath64 charge does not play any role in the hypercharge generator , thus any of the two possible neutral singlets with @xmath85 may appear in the spectrum .",
    "had we chosen to keep the neutral state with @xmath86 , a direct tree - level dirac mass term @xmath87 would be possible as was discussed in the previous section . in the alternative case of @xmath88 , an effective non - perturbative term through instanton effects",
    "can be generated from the @xmath89 intersections of figure ( [ f3 ] ) provided @xmath90 , so that the @xmath64 charge excess @xmath91 is canceled by the instanton factor of the non - perturbative coupling .",
    "instanton effects can also generate majorana masses for the singlet right - handed neutrino which are of the form @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite m_n , j&=&_n , je^-s_e m_s where @xmath92 summarizes contributions of the khler potential and the one - loop determinant  @xcite .",
    "the zero modes on the @xmath89 intersections generating an effective dirac neutrino mass term.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    compared to a direct tree - level perturbative mass term , the instanton generated dirac neutrino mass in this model is more attractive for the following two reasons .",
    "first , there is a suppression factor analogous to that of the majorana right - handed neutrino mass . as a consequence",
    ", the see - saw mechanism @xmath93 can be implemented with a moderate value of the string scale .",
    "a second observation is that in the derivation of the neutrino mass term though instanton effects , the corresponding disk diagrams do not involve simultaneously the matter fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling in the @xmath96 flavor space is factorizable . to exhibit the advantage of such a simplified structure of the neutrino mass matrix , we assume as an example the case of almost diagonal charged lepton mass matrix .",
    "we further assume symmetric types of mass matrices and parametrise the dirac neutrino mass matrix in terms of two real parameters as follows .",
    "let the vector ^=\\{1,r , r } represent the three @xmath97 s in flavor space .",
    "then , we write the instanton induced factorizable dirac neutrino yukawa coupling as follows y_ij&=&e^_ij_i^_j^ where @xmath98 are possible phases .",
    "we can write the dirac neutrino mass matrix as follows m_d^= (    lll 1 & r ( ) & r ( ) + r ( ) & e^_1r^2 ^2 ( ) & e^_2 ( 2 ) + r ( ) & e^_3 ( 2 ) & e^_4r^2 ^2 ( )    ) it is easy now to pick up choices of the parameters that reproduce the known neutrino data .",
    "let us for the sake of simplicity concentrate on a specific example , choosing a set of phases @xmath99 and @xmath100 . if we further assume the expansion @xmath101 , we get m_^eff.m_dm_n^-1m_d^t & & (    lll - & ( ) & ( ) + ( ) & -^2 ( ) & - ( 2 ) + ( ) & - ( 2 ) & -^2 ( )    ) m_0 where @xmath102 is of the order @xmath103 and should be in the sub - ev range . from the point of view of the experimental and other observational data for neutrino masses and their mixing ,",
    "this is a very interesting example of a neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this gives bimaximal mixing and an inverted hierarchy spectrum with two almost degenerate eigenmasses @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , which , if small corrections are received from charged lepton mixing , could fit the neutrino data@xcite .",
    "in this work we have discussed in some detail vital issues regarding the yukawa sector in an effective standard model theory obtained from a minimal d - brane configuration  @xcite equivalent to the gauge symmetry @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , we have explored the implications of the custodial global @xmath2 symmetries ( indispensable in these constructions ) on the fermion masses using sensible , phenomenologically consistent variants of the fermion and higgs spectra .    in the desirable and elegant case of a minimal spectrum consisting just of the mssm chiral matter , the right - handed neutrino and the one doublet higgs pair , several yukawa couplings are absent in the perturbative superpotential . it was found that the suggested mechanism based on string space - time instanton contributions can generate the missing yukawa couplings which fill in the zero entries of the perturbative quark mass matrices .",
    "these corrections are found to be suppressed by an exponential factor of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 in the classical instanton action .",
    "this is a generic characteristic with rather exciting and unprecedented implications on the low energy phenomenology of these constructions .",
    "thus in a realistic d - brane standard model analogue one could envisage to interpret the fermion mass spectrum through these instanton effects , attributing the observed mass hierarchy to the aforementioned exponential suppression of the non - perturbative couplings . furthermore , a rather interesting dirac neutrino mass matrix texture is predicted and heavy majorana masses are also induced from similar non - perturbative effects . as an example , we have presented a simple parametrization of this specific texture which easily reconciles the neutrino experimental data .",
