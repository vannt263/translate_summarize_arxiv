    "ensures the faithful transmission of the polarization state . at the pbs of the tqc ,",
    "the photon is either transmitted or reflected into the short or long path , respectively . to ensure both photons leave the interferometer at the desired output port ,",
    "a quarter - wave plate is inserted in each path . directly after the interferometer the photon passes through a polarizer ( pol ) set to an equal superposition between the polarizations .",
    "this allows , at the cost of 50% transmission loss , to erase polarization information for each time - bin state , which completes the map @xmath65 and @xmath66 from polarization to time - bin state .",
    "the time - bin qubit is then coupled into a smf with a collection efficiency of 0.67 , which gives a total transmission through the tqc of 0.24 .",

    "the non - classicality of time - polarization entanglement is bounded with an estimate of the bell - chsh inequality violation @xcite . despite the absence of an active phase control , required to set measurement bases for the time - bin qubit deterministically , we search for the maximally obtainable violation by varying the measurement basis . more specifically , we first set the measurement basis for the polarization qubit to @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 using wave plates , and slowly and continuously change the path - length difference of the multimode time - bin qubit analyzer ( mm - tqa ) by externally heating it .",
    "this allows us to scan projection measurements for the time - bin qubit in the superposition bases .",
    "6(a ) shows coincidences between a polarization qubit ( two detectors , i.e. d1 and d2 ) and a time - bin qubit ( three temporal modes ) .",
    "detections in the _ early / late _ bin ( _ middle _ bin ) corresponds to a projection of the time - bin qubit onto @xmath71 @xmath69 @xmath72 ( @xmath73 @xmath69 @xmath74 ) . owing to the absence of the second output of the tqa , we consider all possible expectation values @xmath75 between any two points in time , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see fig .",

    "we then change the measurement basis for the polarization qubit to @xmath82 @xmath69 @xmath83 and repeat the procedure .",
    "finally , we compute the chsh - bell inequality parameter      and find the value of @xmath44=2.42 @xmath1 0.05 , which is clearly above classical bound @xmath85=2 . to see whether this value agrees with the measured visibilities , we model the two - qubit state with noise , described by an asymmetric depolarization channel , on a time - bin qubit .",
    "the output state is then described by      where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the depolarization probability and single - qubit pauli operator along the channel j , respectively . here , @xmath89 denotes the input state , described in eq . of the main text . assuming unbiased depolarizations in the superposition bases , i.e. @xmath90 , we calculate expectation values @xmath75 = tr @xmath91 for given measurement bases . using the definition of visibility",
    ", we further represent the chsh - bell parameter @xmath45 = @xmath92 as a function of entanglement visibilities .",
    "we find @xmath45 = 2.47 @xmath1 0.02 is in accordance with our measured value @xmath93 .",
    "our multimode time - bin qubit analyzer is passively stabilized by enclosing it with black hardboard . in order to assess the phase stability of the mm - tqa",
    ", we perform joint - projection measurement onto the superposition bases over a half an hour .",
    "the time - bin qubit is projected onto a @xmath94 and the polarization qubit alternatively between @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the expectation values , defined as @xmath97 , where @xmath79 denotes joint - detection counts when a 842 nm photon is projected onto @xmath26 and a 776 nm photon onto @xmath27 . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the average expectation value @xmath98 remains always higher than 0.65 , which is well above the required value @xmath99 for verifying entanglement , given entanglement visibility @xmath100  =  0.952 ( see fig .",
    "5 in the main text ) .          as entanglement is fundamentally important and an effective distribution of entanglement is a necessary condition for secure qkd  @xcite , we need to verify whether or not entanglement is present in our experiment .",
    "this is especially important in the absence of a complete security analysis of a qkd implementation .",
    "we assume that the spontaneous parametric down - conversion process generates a pair of photons with negligible multiple - photon - pairs event .",
    "each photon is a polarization qubit and the pair of photons is potentially entangled . by detecting one photon in the pair",
    ", we can herald the generation of the second photon .",
    "after the conversion from polarization qubit to time - bin qubit , the second one is transmitted to the mm - tqa .",
    "suppose that alice holds the polarization qubit while bob holds the time - bin qubit . to include conversion and transmission losses of the time - bin qubit , we enlarge the dimension of bob s system from @xmath101 to @xmath102 by adding a dimension corresponding to no photon arriving at bob .",
    "hence , the final state @xmath103 shared by alice and bob is a @xmath104-dimensional state .",
    "we need to verify whether or not the state @xmath103 is entangled using only the measurement results @xmath105 and @xmath106 without further assumptions on the state . since the measurements of alice and bob are block - diagonal with respect to the subspaces of total photon number , as we will show below in eq .   and",
    ", we can also assume without loss of generality that the state @xmath103 shows the same structure .",
    "this follows from the fact that the measurement structure allows us to assume that a quantum non - demolition measurement of the total photon number is executed before the actual measurement itself .    in order to verify entanglement",
    ", we need to know how to accurately describe the measurements on the polarization qubit and on the time - bin qubit .",
    "for the polarization qubit , we measure it in the _ horizontal_/_vertical _ or _ diagonal_/_anti - diagonal _ basis , i.e. along the z- or x - axis in the bloch sphere . in the _",
    "horizontal_/_vertical _ basis , these measurements are represented as    @xmath107         0 &    0      \\\\[0.3em ]       \\end{bmatrix } , m_\\text{v}=\\begin{bmatrix }         0 &    0      \\\\[0.3em ]         0 &    1      \\\\[0.3em ]       \\end{bmatrix } , m_\\text{d}=\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix }         1 &    1      \\\\[0.3em ]         1 &    1      \\\\[0.3em ]       \\end{bmatrix},\\text { and } m_\\text{a}=\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix }         1 &    -1      \\\\[0.3em ]         -1 &    1      \\\\[0.3em ]       \\end{bmatrix } ,        \\label{eq : meas_alice }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the subscript indicates measurement outcome , and h , v , d , or a denotes the _ horizontal _ , _ vertical _ , _ diagonal _ , or _ anti - diagonal _ polarization . on the other side , for the time - bin qubit",
    ", the photon loss in the long path or the short path of the mm - tqa could be different from each other .",
    "hence , the operators corresponding to measurement of the time - bin qubit in the _ early_/_late_-time basis or in the superposition bases could deviate from the ideal case . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose the relative phase between the _ early_-time and _ late_-time basis states in the superposition basis to be zero .",

    "note that in our experiment @xmath110 and @xmath111 are very close to each other .    after knowing the description of alice s and bob s joint state @xmath103 and also that of their measurements",
    ", we can verify entanglement by the negative partial - transpose ( npt ) criterion  @xcite .",
    "the npt criterion is used because this criterion is satisfied if and only if a state is entangled , given the state is @xmath112- or @xmath104-dimensional  @xcite .",
    "the npt criterion has been applied to verify entanglement in qkd systems , such as in @xcite .",
    "explicitly , we verify entanglement by solving the following semi - definite program ( sdp ) :    @xmath113=\\mathcal{v}_{+\\text{z}}\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho(m_\\text{h}\\otimes m_\\text{e}+m_\\text{v}\\otimes m_\\text{e } ) ] \\\\ & &   \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho(m_\\text{v}\\otimes m_\\text{l}-m_\\text{h}\\otimes m_\\text{l})]=\\mathcal{v}_{-\\text{z}}\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho(m_\\text{v}\\otimes m_\\text{l}+m_\\text{h}\\otimes m_\\text{l } ) ] \\\\ & &   \\operatorname{tr}[\\rho(m_\\text{d}\\otimes m_\\text{x}-m_\\text{a}\\otimes m_\\text{x})]=\\mathcal{v}_\\text{xy}\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho(m_\\text{d}\\otimes m_\\text{x}+m_a\\otimes m_\\text{x } ) ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath114 is the partial - transpose operation on a subsystem , such as on the polarization - qubit subsystem , and @xmath115 denotes the tensor product .",
    "note that , we formulate the last three constraints according to the measured visibilities .",
    "the first two of them are based on entanglement visibilities @xmath116 and @xmath117 conditioned on measurement outcomes of the time - bin qubit being early time and late time , respectively .",
    "the last constraint is based on entanglement visibility @xmath118 , where the time - bin qubit comes out in the _ middle _ bin .",
    "since the mm - tqa has only one output , we can not differentiate the case when the photon comes out from the second output if this output exists from the case when the photon is lost over the transmission .",
    "hence , we can not formulate two constraints based on @xmath118 .    in our experiment",
    ", we verified that within experimental errors the visibilities @xmath119 .",
    "so , for solving the sdp program in eq .",
    "we set @xmath120 . using the measured results @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the sdp program in eq .",
    "is not feasible , signifying that the state @xmath103 must be entangled .",
    "furthermore , by numerically checking over which values of @xmath123 and @xmath118 the sdp program in eq .",
    "is not feasible , we are able to upper bound the required visibilities @xmath123 and @xmath118 in order to certify the presence of entanglement in the system .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig .  5 of the main text .",
    "from this figure , one can see that our visibility result at any observed incident angle witnesses entanglement with high confidence . finally , we would like to note two points .",
    "first , the constrains considered in eq .",
    "are independent of the transmission or conversion loss of the photon arriving at the mm - tqa , and even independent of the common photon loss in the two different paths of the mm - tqa .",
    "therefore , the upper bounds on the visibilities @xmath123 and @xmath118 obtained for verifying entanglement are independent of all of these different losses .",
    "second , we numerically verified that the classical boundary , as shown in fig .  5 of the main text , is even independent of the relative loss between the two paths of the mm - tqa ."
