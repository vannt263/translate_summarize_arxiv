    "wireless localization in harsh communication environments ( e.g. , in a building where wireless nodes are separated by concrete walls and other obstacles ) can be appreciably affected by direct path attenuation and nlos conditions . in principle",
    ", the effects of nlos errors can be mitigated adopting techniques for detecting los / nlos conditions or algorithms for estimating the errors themselves ( i.e. , the _ bias _ due to obstacles ) .",
    "these approaches can potentially improve the overall accuracy and are expected to satisfy certain requirements ; in particular , they should be _ robust _ against changes in the propagation environment , _ stable _ ( i.e. , they should never amplify nlos errors ) and should be able to exploit all the available data ( e.g. , received waveforms and _ a priori _ information ) .",
    "various solutions for nlos error mitigation in uwb environments are available in the technical literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in particular , a simple deterministic model , dubbed _ wall extra delay _ , is proposed in @xcite to estimate the bias introduced by walls .",
    "a non - parametric support vector machine is employed in @xcite for _ joint _ bias mitigation and channel status detection ; this approach exploits multiple features extracted from received signals in a non - statistical fashion .",
    "a few classification algorithms for los / nlos detection are compared in @xcite , where it is shown that the best solution is offered by a statistical strategy based on the joint _ probability density function _ ( pdf ) of the delay spread and the kurtosis extracted from the received signals . finally , in @xcite statistical models for the _ time of arrival _",
    "( toa ) , the _ received signal strength _",
    "( rss ) and the _ root mean square delay spread _",
    "( rds ) are developed and an iterative estimator for bias mitigation is devised .",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "in fact , first of all , the problem of joint statistical modeling of multiple features extracted from a database of waveforms acquired in a toa - based localization system is investigated .",
    "note that , as far as we know , in the technical literature only univariate models for bias mitigation have been proposed until now ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the use of multiple signal features in uwb localization systems has been investigated in @xcite for channel state detection only and in @xcite , where , however , the considered features ( namely , the kurtosis , the mean excess delay and the delay spread ) have been modelled as independent random variables . the second contribution offered by this manuscript is represented by a performance comparison of various _ maximum - likelihood _ ( ml ) estimators for toa - based localization . in particular , unlike other papers ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite ) we illustrate some numerical results referring to the accuracy of different localization strategies , rather than to capability of the bias removal on a single radio link .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : experimental - activities ] some information about our uwb experimental campaign and about the features extracted from the acquired data are provided . in section [ sec :",
    "localization - algorithms ] some estimation algorithms for uwb radiolocalization are described , whereas their performance is compared in section [ sec : numerical - results ] .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a measurement campaign was conducted by our research group in the second half of 2010 in order to assess the impact of nlos bias errors on a real world uwb system for localization ; all the measured data were acquired by means of two fcc - compliant pulson220 radios commercialised by timedomain and were collected in a database .",
    "such devices are equipped with omnidirectional antennas , are characterized by a -10 db bandwidth and a central frequency equal to 3.2 ghz and 4.7 ghz , respectively , and perform two - way toa ranging ; they also allow to store digitised received waveforms ( a sampling frequency of 24.2 ghz and 14 bits per sample are used ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that various databases providing a collection of sampled uwb waveforms acquired in experimental campaigns and useful for assessing the performance of localization algorithms are already available ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , our database has been specifically generated to assess the correlation between the nlos bias error and various features extracted from the received signals , as it will become clearer in the next paragraph .",
    "our measurement campaign consisted of two phases .",
    "first , the transmitter was placed in a given room ( room a in fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] ) and the receiver in an adjacent room ( room b in fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] ) separated from room a by a wall having thickness @xmath0 cm ( nlos condition ) ; in addition , the transmit antenna was kept fixed , whereas the receive antenna was placed in @xmath1 distinct vertices of a dense square grid ( the distance between a couple of nearest vertices was equal to 21 cm ) . in the second phase of our measurement campaign both the transmitter and the receiver",
    "were placed in room b ; then , the transmit antenna was kept fixed , whereas the receive antenna was moved on the same dense grid as in the first phase to acquire the uwb waveform in @xmath2 distinct vertices .",
    "the positions of the transmit antenna in the two phases were @xmath3 m and @xmath4 m , respectively , if the coordinate system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : environment ] is employed .",
    "the distance between the two antennas varied between 1 m and about 5 m ; larger distances were not taken into consideration since we were interested in indoor ranging only .",
    "it is important that to note that the choice of the measurement scenarios described above is motivated by the fact that uwb signals experienced similar propagation in both phases .    for each position of the receive antenna up to 25 realizations of the received uwb signal",
    "were acquired ( each one lasting @xmath5 ns ) , in order to filter out the effects of the measurement noise and the toa estimate outliers in the postprocessing phase .",
    "the analysis of the multiple waveforms referring to each link evidenced the presence of few time - variant artifacts ( mostly due to the movements of the people behind the radios ) ; as a matter of fact , the channel in our measurement campaign can be deemed quasi - static and is characterized by reflections mainly due to the walls , the ceiling and the floor of the room ( or rooms ) hosting the radio devices .    finally , for each acquired waveform , a toa estimate ( evaluated by the pulson220 devices ) and the actual transmitter - receiver distance ( evaluated by means of a metric tape with an accuracy better than 1 cm ) were also stored in the database .",
    "the toa estimates have been used to provide a common time frame to all the acquired waveforms ; this has made possible the estimation of the mean excess delay and of other signal statistics in the signal processing phase .",
    ", width=302 ]      in each of the two measurement phases described in the previous paragraph , the procedure for acquiring uwb waveforms worked as follows .",
    "first , the uwb radios carried out their handshaking procedure for achieving mutual time synchronization ; then , the receiver sampled the incoming waveforms and generated a toa estimate for each of them ; let @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denote the received waveform and the corresponding toa  estimate ( here the function @xmath10 represents the internal procedure adopted by the pulson220 devices , based on energy thresholds and a go - back technique , to estimate the toa ; see @xcite for further details ) acquired over the @xmath11-th link in los ( nlos ) conditions .",
    "the model @xmath12 was adopted for the measured toa ( for both los and nlos conditions ) . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the speed of light , @xmath14 denotes the _ distance _ between the transmitter and the receiver , @xmath15 is the nlos _ bias _ ( in seconds ) affecting the toa measurement ( the values taken on by this random parameter are always positive for nlos links and null for los links is @xmath16 . ] ) and @xmath17 is the _ measurement noise _ ; in addition , the expression @xmath18 is adopted for the variance of the measurement noise , where @xmath19 is a parameter depending on both the specific toa estimator employed in the ranging measurements and on various parameters of the physical layer , and @xmath20 is the _ path - loss exponent _ ( a known and fixed value is assumed for this parameter in both los and nlos conditions @xcite ) .

    "in this section we develop various algorithms for two - dimensional localization in a uwb network composed by @xmath21 anchors with _ known",
    "_ positions @xmath22^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r}^{2}$ ] , @xmath23 and by a single node ( dubbed mobile station , ms , in the following ) with _ unknown _ position @xmath24^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r}^{2}$ ] .",
    "any couple of the given @xmath25 devices can operate in a los ( nlos ) condition with probability @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the localization algorithms described below try to mitigate the effects of the nlos bias error and aim at generating an estimate @xmath28 of @xmath29 minimizing the _ mean square error _",
    "( mse ) @xmath30 .",
    "it is also important to point out that localization algorithms developed for nlos scenarios usually consist of two steps .",
    "in fact , first the nlos bias is estimated for each involved link and is used to remove the bias contribution in the acquired data ; then the new data set is processed by a _",
    "least - square _ ( ls ) procedure generating an estimate of @xmath31 ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . a different approach , involving implicit estimation of the bias for each link , is adopted in the following ; this approach is motivated by the fact that the estimation of the bias for the @xmath11-th link can benefit from the information acquired from the other ( @xmath32 ) links ; note that in @xcite and @xcite bias mitigation performed in a link - by - link fashion is exploited to assign a weight in a _ weighted least - square _ ( wls ) step , but such an approach is heuristic .",
    "if the links between the ms and the @xmath21 different anchors are assumed mutually independent , the ml estimation strategy of the unknown ms position @xmath31 , given a toa estimate and a set of additional signal features for each link , can be formulated as @xmath33 here , @xmath34^{t}\\in\\mathbb{r}^{2}$ ] denotes the ms trial position , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the toa and @xmath37-dimensional signal vector collecting the received signal features acquired for the @xmath11-th link and @xmath38 is the joint pdf of the toa and the vector of features parameterized by the trial position @xmath39 .",
    "as already discussed in paragraph [ sub : statistical - results ] , various options for @xmath40 ( and , consequently , for @xmath38 ) are possible ; in the following paragraphs the impact of such options on the ml strategy ( [ eq : ml_estimator-1 ] ) is investigated .      in this paragraph two",
    "different options are considered for the set of features processed by the ml strategy .",
    "[ [ option - a ] ] option a + + + + + + + +    in this case it is assumed that the vector of features referring to the @xmath11-th link is @xmath41^{t}$ ] ; this choice is motivated by the large correlation between these random variables and the link bias @xmath42 ( see paragraph [ sub : statistical - results ] ) .",
    "then , the joint pdf @xmath43 appearing in the ml strategy ( [ eq : ml_estimator-1 ] ) can be expressed as ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : experimental_sigmodel ] ) ) : @xmath44 where ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmax_signalmodel ] ) , ( [ eq : taum_m_signalmodel ] ) , ( [ eq : tauds_m_signalmodel ] ) ) @xmath45^{t}\\ ] ] @xmath46 is the distance between the @xmath11-th anchor and the ms trial position and @xmath47 denotes the convolution between the joint pdf @xmath48 and the observation noise pdf @xmath49 .",
    "note that the shape of the function @xmath48 under the _ hypothesis of _ los _ conditions _",
    "( @xmath50 event ) is substantially different from that found in nlos conditions ( @xmath51 event ) @xcite ; in both cases this function was estimated applying the procedure described in @xcite to the data collected in our measurement campaign .",
    "this led to two distinct multidimensional histograms , which approximate the required pdf s @xmath52 and @xmath53 with a certain accuracy depending on : a ) the amount of acquired data ; b ) the sizes @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the quantization bins adopted in the generation of the histograms .",
    "note that these sizes need to be accurately selected , since large bins imply a coarse approximation of pdf s , whereas excessively small bins require a huge amount of data .",
    "given an estimate of the above mentioned couple of pdf s , the pdf @xmath48 can be evaluated as @xmath58 if the probabilities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are available , or as @xmath61 if no _ a priori _ information about the los / nlos conditions are available .    in principle , evaluating the joint pdf @xmath43 of the ml strategy entails the computation of the convolution appearing in ( [ eq:4d_ml_pdf ] ) ; this has not been done in our work , since it is numerically complicated and a form of implicit smoothing is already included in the generation of the above mentioned histograms extracted from the available measurements .",
    "[ [ option - b ] ] option b + + + + + + + +    in this case the set of features employed in ml estimation consists of a single element , namely the delay spread ( which exhibits the largest correlation with the nlos bias ; see table [ tab : corr_values_b_xj ] ) , so that @xmath62 and the pdf @xmath43 of ( [ eq : ml_estimator-1 ] ) becomes ( see ( [ eq:4d_ml_pdf ] ) ) @xmath63 like in the previous case , the pdf @xmath64 was estimated in the los and nlos scenarios ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_2d_bias_taurms ] ) from the data acquired in our measurement campaign .",
    "note that this option leads to a ml localization algorithm which is substantially simpler than that proposed in the analysis of option a.      the ml strategies developed above are based on the joint pdf s @xmath65 and @xmath64 , which refer to a set of _ distance - independent parameters_. since the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 exhibit a lower correlation with @xmath42 than their distance - dependent counterparts @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( see tables [ tab : corr_values_b_xj ] and [ tab : corr_values_b_rv_indip_distance ] ) , the use of the joint pdf @xmath72 in place of ( [ eq:4d_ml_pdf ] ) has been also investigated ( similar comments apply to ( [ eq:2d_ml_pdf ] ) ) .",
    "as already explained above , the joint pdf s involved in the proposed ml localization strategies can be easily estimated from the acquired data using a simple procedure based on dividing the space of observed data in a set of bins of proper size .",
    "such a procedure generates an histogram , which , unluckily , entails poor localization performance if employed as it is , because of the relatively small number of bins ( adopted to avoid empty bins ) . to mitigate this problem , interpolation followed by low - pass filtering",
    "can be applied to raw experimental histograms . in particular",
    ", we found out that cubic spline interpolation followed by moving average filtering ( with a window size equal to about 1/15 of the size of the histogram ) provides good results ( an example of the resulting pdf is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_2d_bias_taurms ] ) ; the localization strategies adopting this approach are dubbed _ interpolated - histogram _ _ estimators _ in the following .",
    "an alternative to this approach is represented by fitting the histograms with analytical functions ( e.g. , polynomials ) . on the one hand , this solution offers some advantages with respect to the previous one , since it requires less memory ( only the values of the coefficients of the fitting equations need to be saved ) and provides better accuracy ( the resulting pdf s are smoother ) . on the other hand",
    ", the use of ( multi - dimensional ) fitting raises a number of problems .",
    "in fact , global performance figures , like the _ _ root mean square error _ _ ( rmse ) are certainly useful , but do not account for the fact that fitting errors where a pdf takes on small values are less critical than those in points where the same pdf takes on large values .",
    "in addition , if the dimensionality of the pdf domain is larger than two , an analytical function generated by a fitting procedure can not be easily represented .    in our statistical analysis ,",
    "the use of polynomial fitting was investigated .",
    "a polynomial degree @xmath73 was selected , since this choice ensures that the resulting rmse is smaller than @xmath74 in both los and nlos scenarios . in the following localization algorithms employing pdf s generated by polynomial fitting will be dubbed _ fitted - histogram _ _",
    "estimators_.      recently , an iterative estimator of both the channel state ( i.e. , los or nlos conditions ) and the nlos bias @xmath42 has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "such an estimator relies on the availability of univariate statistical models for the estimates of toa , rss and rds ; it is shown , however , that estimation accuracy is improved if the delay - spread is exploited as the only discriminant feature .    in the following , a modified version of this iterative algorithm ( dubbed _ iterative _ _ estimator _ ) , employing the joint pdf s described above and extracted from our experimental database , is proposed .",
    "this algorithm is summarized by the flow diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iterative_block_diagram ] and operates as follows . in its first iteration",
    "it starts with a null estimate of the nlos bias and , for each link , generates a set of posterior probabilities integrating the pdf s estimated in los and nlos conditions .",
    "then , such probabilities are employed to compute a couple of decision variables on the basis of which a decision @xmath75 on the los / nlos conditions is taken .",
    "finally , such a decision is exploited to compute a new bias estimate which is used to start the next iteration .",
    "note that this algorithm operates in a link - by - link fashion and that in the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : iterative_block_diagram ] the dependence on the link index has been omitted to ease the reading .    ,",
    "our experimental database has also been exploited to assess the rmse performance of the proposed algorithms for localization and nlos bias mitigation schemes via computer simulations . in our simulations",
    "the ms coordinates are always @xmath76 ; then , following @xcite , for the @xmath11-th anchor a received waveform from either the los database ( with probability @xmath26 ) or from the nlos database ( with probability @xmath77 ) was drawn randomly and was associated with the position @xmath78 , where @xmath14 is the distance measured for the selected waveform .",
    "note that these waveforms already include the experimental noise and thus no simulated noise was imposed on the waveforms ( so that the signal - to - noise ratio is the experimental one ) . finally , the parameter @xmath21 has been set to @xmath79 ( worst case which still theoretically allows unambiguous localization ) .",
    "the rmse performance of the following algorithms has been evaluated :    1 .",

    "different estimators can provide significantly different accuracies for distinct values of @xmath26 , when this probability is not close to unity .",
    "the simple ls algorithm is outperformed by all the other algorithms when @xmath82 ; this is due to the fact that this strategy does not try to mitigate the nlos bias .",
    "3 .   the ve algorithm performs well at the cost of a reasonable complexity , but offers limited bias mitigation when @xmath83 ; in this case the ml-2d , ml-2d - id and ml-4d - f estimators perform much better .",
    "4 .   the exploitation of a large set of received signal features does not necessarily allow to achieve better accuracy than a subset of them ( see the curves referring to ml-2d and ml-4d estimators ) ; this is due to the fact that the correlation between the different couples of extracted features is typically large , so that they provide strongly correlated information about the nlos bias .",
    "distance - dependent parameterization provides better accuracy ( see the curves referring to the ml-2d and ml-2d - id estimators ) ; this can be related to the fact that @xmath68 is less correlated with the nlos bias than its distance - dependent counterpart @xmath71 .",
    "the ml-4d - f estimator performs better than the ml-4d estimator in nlos conditions ; this means that the use of fitted histograms entails an improvement in localization accuracy .",
