    "the subscript _ iso _ in @xmath172 emphasizes that this correlation length was obtained from the orientational average @xmath177 of the four - point structure factor @xmath156 .",
    "it appears that this scaling holds well for the small @xmath5 values , but we will again caution that simulations of larger systems need to be performed to verify this observation .",
    "shown as the inset to the figure is @xmath178 versus @xmath160 for wave vectors with a magnitude less than five , and the deviation from the scaling behavior is obvious for the larger wave vectors .",

    "this growth of the correlation length is consistent with recent results of berthier and jack @xcite .",

    "we show @xmath174 versus @xmath168 , where @xmath183 depends on the angle @xmath68 between @xmath55 and @xmath110 , for @xmath184 , 0.6 , 0.55 , 0.5 , 0.47 , and 0.45 in fig .",

    "[ fig : s4scale ] are the correlation lengths .",
    "they depend on the angle between @xmath55 and @xmath110 , and the correlation lengths are largest for @xmath171 and smallest for @xmath73 .",
    "again , we observe that for @xmath171 , the correlation lengths are larger than half the simulation cell for @xmath136 ( where @xmath185 ) and lower .",
    "this strongly suggests that already at @xmath136 simulations of larger systems are needed in order to verify the present results .",
    "in previous studies it has been found that the correlation length is related to the @xmath3 relaxation time according to a power law , @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "recently , this behavior was rationalized by the inhomogeneous mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "we fitted the the correlation lengths to a power law of the form @xmath186 and obtained values ranging from @xmath187 for @xmath73 and @xmath188 for @xmath171 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] is @xmath172 obtained from @xmath127 ; in this case we found @xmath189 , which is very close to the previously reported value of 0.22 , @xcite . using this analysis",
    ", we find that the dynamic correlation length is not only different for different angles between @xmath55 and @xmath110 , but they also grow at a different rate as the temperature is lowered and the @xmath3 relaxation time increases .",
    "the range of correlations for particles moving in the same direction are longer than for particles moving in different directions , but it increases slower with decreasing temperature .",
    "another scaling prediction is that @xmath190 . to test this prediction we fit @xmath191 to the form @xmath192 . in this way we obtain @xmath193 , which is again very close to the value of 0.4 reported in ref .",
    "these values are slightly smaller than the recent inhomogeneous mode - coupling theory prediction of @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies looking for a growing length scale that accompanies the drastic slowing down of the dynamics in supercooled and glass forming liquids .",
    "recently , one such possibility was examined by biroli _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite where they associated a growing correlation length with a point - to - set correlation function in a model supercooled liquid .",
    "ever since the observation of heterogeneous dynamics in supercooled and glassy systems , it has been suggested that a dynamic correlation length may be associated with the size of the dynamically heterogeneous regions . since two point correlation functions",
    "are inadequate to describe the correlated motion of atoms and correlated relaxation of the fluid , four - point correlation functions have been developed to examine this cooperative motion .",
    "normally these correlation functions are assumed to be isotropic , or are isotropic by design .",
    "however , it has been observed that correlated displacements of particles are not isotropic , and thus it is not surprising that the four - point correlation functions might also not be isotropic .    in this work we examined the anisotropy of a four - point correlation function .",
    "we found that for distances comparable to the nearest neighbor distance the anisotropy initially increases upon supercooling the liquid , but then seems to saturate or even decrease at the lowest temperatures .",
    "furthermore , the time scale that this anisotropy is a maximum for nearest neighbor distances is around the @xmath3 relaxation time at higher temperatures , but then it increases slower with decreasing temperature than the @xmath3 relaxation time and roughly follows the time corresponding to the peak position of the non - gaussian parameter @xmath195 , @xmath99 .    for larger distances , we also found anisotropy of the four - point correlation function .",
    "we studied the time dependence of this longer ranged anisotropy and found that the time at which it is the largest also approximately follows @xmath99 in the supercooled liquid .",
    "the longer range anisotropy introduces a challenge in determining the growing dynamic length scale @xmath196 in glass forming systems .",
    "this difficulty is compounded by the relatively small system sizes usually employed in simulational studies of the glass transition .",
    "we developed a procedure to extract effective dynamic length scales , but larger system sizes need to be simulated to verify our results .",
    "our procedure suggests that the dynamic correlation length is different depending on the relative direction of motion of two particles within the fluid .",
    "furthermore , this anisotropic length scale also increases at a different rate with decreasing temperature .",
    "we hope that our present work will stimulate future research in two different directions .",
    "first , we advocate the need to study larger systems and to perform serious finite - size analysis of the results @xcite .",
    "in particular , we expect that in the small @xmath110 limit four - point structure factor @xmath1 is isotropic and we thus we expect its anisotropic component @xmath128 to vanish in the small @xmath110 limit .",
    "these expectations should be confirmed by simulations of larger systems .",
    "second , we hope that this work will stimulate a development of a theoretical model that describes the anisotropy of four - point dynamic correlations .",
