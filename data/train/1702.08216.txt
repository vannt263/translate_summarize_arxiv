    "in this paper we consider for @xmath1 the general family of monic polynomials in one variable @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for its @xmath30th derivative w.r.t . @xmath31",

    "we define the _ @xmath30th order discriminant _ of @xmath22 as @xmath3res@xmath4 which is the determinant of the sylvester matrix @xmath36 .",

    "we say that the variable @xmath42 is of _ quasi - homogeneous weight _ @xmath43 because up to a sign it equals the @xmath43th elementary symmetric polynomial in the roots of the polynomial @xmath22 ; the quasi - homogeneous weight of @xmath31 is  @xmath44 .",
    "there are at least two problems in which such discriminants are of interest .",
    "one of them is the casas - alvero conjecture that if a complex univariate polynomial has a root in common with each of its nonconstant derivatives , then it is a power of a linear polynomial , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the claim in @xcite that the answer to the conjecture is positive .",
    "another one is the study of the possible arrangements of the roots of a hyperbolic polynomial ( i.e. real and with all roots real ) and of all its nonconstant derivatives on the real line .",
    "this problem can be generalized to a class of polynomial - like functions characterized by the property their @xmath45th derivative to vanish nowhere .",

    "example : the family of polynomials @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 parameters two of which can be eliminated by shifting and rescaling the variable @xmath31 which gives ( up to a nonzero constant factor ) the family @xmath51 . for @xmath52 , @xmath53",

    "hence for all @xmath991 with @xmath992 the restriction of @xmath922 to these translates are smooth analytic functions having simple zeros at the intersection points of the translates with @xmath981 .",
    "but this means that the power of the factor @xmath156 in formula ( [ formula ] ) applied to the polynomial @xmath878 is equal to @xmath44 on the intersection of @xmath983 with some open ball of dimension @xmath881 centered at @xmath993 in the space of the variables @xmath994 .",
    "hence this power equals @xmath44 on some zariski open dense subset @xmath995 of @xmath983 ( if its complement @xmath996 is nonempty , then on @xmath995 this power might be @xmath997 ) . thus the equality @xmath165 is justified for @xmath168 , @xmath998 ( because it is the coefficient of @xmath999 , not of @xmath1000 of @xmath878 , that equals @xmath130 ) .",
    "now we adapt the above reasoning to the situation , where instead of a point @xmath1001 one considers a point @xmath1002 .",
    "each of the translates of @xmath986 intersects @xmath982 transversally , at just one point .",
    "the restriction of @xmath152 to the translate is a smooth analytic function having a double zero , so a priori the restriction of @xmath922 to it has either one double or two simple zeros .",
    "( under an analytic deformation a double zero either remains such or splits into two simple zeros .",
    ") however two simple zeros is impossible because these zeros would be two points of @xmath982 whereas the translate contains just one point .",
    "thus the power @xmath183 of the factor @xmath157 is justified for some zariski open dense subset of @xmath984 .",
    "once again , this is sufficient to claim that formula ( [ formula ] ) is valid for @xmath168 and for @xmath998 .",
    "recall that by remark  [ remintermediate ] we have to show that for @xmath170 one has @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "the first of these equalities was proved in section  [ seck=1 ] ( see proposition  [ propk=1 ] ) , so there remains to prove the second one .    as in the proof of statement  [ sta ] we set @xmath864 , @xmath865 @xmath866 .",
    "we define the polynomial @xmath1003 to correspond to the case @xmath173 ( i.e. @xmath1004 , @xmath44 , @xmath1005 for @xmath154 , @xmath183 ) . for @xmath173 theorem  [ maintm ]",
    "is proved in section  [ secmn-2 ] , so we assume that @xmath1006 and we set @xmath1007 , where @xmath869 and for @xmath1008 , @xmath27 , one has @xmath26 .",
    "denote by @xmath1009 the @xmath893-matrix @xmath1010 .",
    "all nonzero entries of the matrix @xmath1009 in the intersection of its last @xmath1014 columns and rows are @xmath41 for @xmath902 .",
    "one can develop @xmath1014 times @xmath1015 w.r.t .",
    "its last column ; each time there is a single nonzero entry in it which equals @xmath939 . the matrix obtained from @xmath1016 by deleting its last @xmath1014 columns and the rows with indices @xmath1017 , @xmath6 , @xmath1018 is precisely @xmath75 .",
    "one can observe that @xmath1019 and @xmath1015 are both degree @xmath876 polynomials in @xmath580 .",
    "assume that @xmath939 belongs to a closed disk on which one has @xmath1020 .",
