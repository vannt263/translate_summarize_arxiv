    "lead zirconate titanate [ pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 , ( pzt ) ] solid solutions are among the most widely used ferroelectric ceramics .",
    "the importance of pzt ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) compositions is due to the exceptionally good piezoelectric properties they exhibit @xcite , which in turn has motivated numerous studies seeking physical mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary behaviour ( for a summary of the various studies see ref . ) .",
    "crystal structure studies and the changes in atomic positions versus composition , temperature , pressure or electric field have a central role for the understanding of these materials : nuclei positions , together with the electron density , determine the electric polarization vector on which the numerous applications are based on .",
    "it is essential to understand how the polarization vector changes as a function of electric field , composition , temperature or pressure .",
    "qualitatively , the average structural tendencies versus composition , temperature or pressure of ionic compounds , such as pzt , can be understood by considering the madelung energies which decreases with decreasing crystal volume until the shortrange interactions balance the crystal volume to its equilibrium value . for ionic crystals",
    "the contribution of madelung energy to the total energy is dominant and implies that crystal volume tends to be minimized . by tilting the oxygen octahedra the crystal can partially compensate for the effect of a larger average @xmath5-cation ( zr and ti ) size which increases with increasing zr content @xmath3 .",
    "this is seen from the behaviour of zr rich samples : once crystal adopts @xmath6 symmetry , instead of @xmath7 symmetry , the volume per primitive cell is smaller .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that in the case it would cost a lot of energy to contract the oxygen octahedra ( due to the shortrange interactions which cause the mere compression of octahedra to be energetically unfavourable ) overall energy gain can still be obtained by tilting the oxygen octahedra .",
    "this can neatly be expressed through the equation @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the polyhedral volumes for @xmath11 and @xmath5 cations and @xmath12 is the mean octahedral tilt angle @xcite .",
    "this expression means that when there is no chance for oxygen octahedra to decrease its volume the crystal can still be compressed by decreasing the volume of the cuboctahedra surrounding the @xmath11 cation .",
    "typically the changes in octahedral tilts occur consistently versus composition@xcite or temperature@xcite and thus particular care is necessary before anomalous octahedral tilt systems are considered . secondly ,",
    "in the case of pzt ( and other pb containing perovskite ferroelectrics ) the crystals suffer from numerous defects .",
    "these defects do have a significant role for ferroelectricity .",
    "an example is provided by the pb ions which are significantly displaced from their ideal sites and which respond to the external electric field or pressure by adjusting their position with a corresponding changes in polarization vector @xcite . as was discussed in ref . , it is not clear if pb displacements are dominantly dynamic or static .",
    "static displacements have commonly been modelled by displacing pb ions towards @xmath13 directions and using isotropic atomic displacement parameters ( adp ) , whereas the dynamic contribution was modelled by anisotropic adp parameters . in some cases",
    ", one can try to distinguish the static and dynamic contributions by collecting structural data as a function of temperature@xcite . in pzt and pbtio@xmath2 crystals",
    "the contribution of anharmonic terms to the potential is significant , as was demonstrated by raman scattering studies in the case of pbtio@xmath2 @xcite and pzt @xcite , and obscures the separation of static and dynamic contributions .",
    "similar situation occurs in many pb and bi containing perovskites and is often believed to be an important factor allowing a co - existence of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering in multiferroic perovskites @xcite .",
    "related consideration holds for zr and ti , whose positions are disordered in two ways : ( i ) the probability that the @xmath5-cation site is occupied by zr ( ti ) is @xmath3 ( @xmath14 ) and ( ii ) the fractional coordinates of zr and ti are different .",
    "the confirmation of the assumption ( i ) is not straightforward , but various powder diffraction and raman scattering studies show that it is a good approximation for most cases . by high resolution powder diffraction instruments it is possible to study these peculiar features by extracting information from the line shapes , in addition to the determination of the average structure .",
    "however , it became apparent that a rather complex lineshape is necessary for the modelling of the diffraction peak profiles , for examples see refs . and .",
    "the structure of the pzt ceramics with composition in the vicinity of the mpb are notoriously tricky to model .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned structural distortions there are two other reasons obscuring the modelling work : ( i ) in practice , no single phase samples are obtained , instead one observes two perovskite phases and ( ii ) diffraction peak profiles are rather complex .",
    "both factors are connected to the fact that this boundary separates tetragonal and rhombohedral phases which do not possess a group - subgroup relationship .",
    "the experimental observation that monoclinic @xmath15 phase separates tetragonal ( space group @xmath16 ) and rhombohedral ( at room temperature space group is @xmath7 ) phases clarified the situation : @xmath15 is a common subgroup of @xmath16 and @xmath7 phases@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , instead of morphotropic phase boundary one occasionally refers to morphotropic phase@xcite .",
    "thus , it is not a surprise that the structural disorder is particularly pronounced in the vicinity of mpb .",
    "this is also partially due to fact that typically the structure and composition of the grain boundaries and bulk are different .",
    "this is revealed from the bragg reflection line shapes , which are almost gaussian like at room temperature @xcite in the case of the less abundant phase . even though it is still an open question whether @xmath15 is stable phase in pzt system it provides an explanation to the peak value of piezoelectric constant via the polarization rotation theory : first - principles computations demonstrated that the polarization rotation provides the lowest free energy path along which there is a large coupling between the polarization and the electric field@xcite , consistently with the experimentally observed large electromechanical response .",
    "thermodynamical consideration of the polarization rotation within monoclinic phase and its impact on piezoelectric properties is given in ref . .",
    "this study addresses the question if it is necessary to invoke the monoclinic phase to explain the observed piezoelectric properties .",
    "recently , a model which used two monoclinic phases ( space group symmetries @xmath17 and @xmath15 ) was claimed to be the correct low - temperature structure of pzt with @xmath18 @xcite , see also note and refs . and .",
    "this report stated that @xmath6 symmetry is not a correct choice for pzt with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the fact that superlattice reflections allow the distinction of @xmath6 and @xmath17 symmetries in favour of the former was overlooked in this study .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath17 symmetry predicts reflections well isolated from those of the @xmath6 symmetry . to summarize the models proposed in refs . and",
    ", we note that the phase which traditionally has been assigned to the rhombohedral symmetry@xcite , was assigned to @xmath15 symmetry and space group symmetry @xmath16 ( at room temperature ) or @xmath17 ( at low temperature ) was assigned to the phase which was modelled by @xmath15 symmetry in refs . and .",
    "thus , significant changes to the well known pzt phase diagram@xcite were proposed . to understand the problems related to such a model ( abbreviated as @xmath19 ) and the reason why the use of space group @xmath17 was previously rejected @xcite it is necessary to summarize the crucial role of the local disorder resulting in @xmath4-dependent line broadening @xcite .",
    "erroneous space group symmetry assignments likely result in once this line broadening is compensated for by reducing the space group symmetry@xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-dependent line broadening is _ an inherent _ property of pzt powders due to the local distortions , and is already seen in tetragonal ti rich compositions and even at high temperature cubic phase@xcite .",
    "namely , the bragg reflection widths were anisotropic already at the cubic phase , although the linewidths were an order of magnitude smaller than in the case of the low - temperature phases .",
    "it is well known that broad peaks are observed in raman spectra collected at high temperature cubic phase , even though no first order raman scattering is allowed for the ideal symmetry .",
    "for example , see ref . , where the modes appearing in cubic phase were assigned to the first order scattering , activated by the local disorder , by studying the temperature dependence of the intensities .",
    "the same behaviour was observed in a closely related pb(hf@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pht ) system with @xmath20 , where the peak widths of the @xmath21 reflections were _ twice _ as large as the widths of @xmath22 reflections@xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that no signs of symmetry lowering from the @xmath16 symmetry was observed in this high - resolution neutron powder diffraction study .",
    "in contrast , light scattering experiments revealed that both in the case of tetragonal pzt and pht samples deviations from the average symmetry were observed @xcite .",
    "namely , the number of raman active modes was larger than the symmetry found by diffraction techniques would allow .",
    "once the diffraction patterns were examined it became apparent that there was no justification to use lower space group symmetry .",
    "a model based on lower space group symmetry would simply result in physically meaningless structural parameters . in this case , the essential point was that even if one insist to invoke lower space group symmetry in order to explain the observed raman spectra the changes in bond lengths should be so large that also high resolution neutron powder diffraction patterns should reveal it .",
    "although one can decrease the average symmetry to decrease the residuals , a more realistic model is obtained by assuming that ( i ) the _ average symmetry _ over a length scale of a few hundred nanometers is @xmath16 , and ( ii ) deviations from this symmetry occur in a local scale ( of a few unit cells ) .",
    "the essential point here is that these deviations are not periodical , at least not in a scale probed by x - ray or neutron diffraction .",
    "however , ion displacements ( particularly those of pb ions ) are likely correlated in a scale of a few unit cells@xcite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that usually there are several line broadening mechanisms .",
    "especially powders consisted of fine crystallites , typically obtained through wet chemical methods allowing a preparation of perovskite phase at rather moderate temperatures , show large broadening due to the small crystallite size , in addition to the anisotropic line broadening @xcite .",
    "williamson - hall plot was constructed to separate crystallite and anisotropic strain broadening effects@xcite in tetragonal pzt .",
    "this study revealed that the lattice strain is greater along the @xmath23 $ ] directions than along the @xmath24 $ ] directions . on the other hand ,",
    "samples prepared through solid state reaction often have an order of magnitude larger crystallite size . in the case of pzt with compositions in the vicinity of the mpb",
    "the line widths are strongly increasing with decreasing temperature@xcite , demonstrating that the crystallite size and shape alone can not account for the observed line broadening behaviour .",
    "similar , although weaker , phenomenon occurs in the case of tetragonal pzt and pht samples .",
    "transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and electron diffraction ( ed ) studies revealed extra reflections in rhombohedral pzts @xcite .",
    "the origin of these reflections was more recently studied by tem and ed together with neutron powder diffraction ( npd ) techniques @xcite . in this",
    "study superlattice reflections of the type @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see table [ ed ] ) were observed , consistently with ref . . among these reflections",
    "only @xmath26 is consistent with @xmath6 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we summarize the observations and interpretations given in ref . as follows :",
    "( i ) @xmath29-type reflections were accompanied by satellites , ( ii ) different areas in the same grain resulted in changes in the relative intensities of the superlattice reflections so that in some cases the extra spots completely disappeared , ( iii ) by collecting data on samples prepared from single crystals and ceramics it was found that the satellites around @xmath29 points are characteristic feature of only ceramics , ( iv ) by studying the temperature dependence of the extra reflections they could be assigned to the ferroelectric state ( no extra reflections were observed at cubic phase ) , ( v ) octahedral tilts and distortions alone are insufficient to explain @xmath25 and @xmath29 superlattice reflections _ with the intensities observed _ ( it was demonstrated that very weak superlattice reflections could be obtained using unrealistically large oxygen octahedra tilts and distortions ) , and ( vi ) npd experiments revealed _ only _",
    "@xmath26 reflections , consistently with an average @xmath6 symmetry .",
    "to explain these observations models based on locally ordered regions presenting antiparallel cation displacements were proposed ( see also ref . where structural models based on npd experiments are given ) and compared with experiments .",
    "finite size effect was proposed as an underlying reason for the phenomena observed by tem and ed techniques .",
    "this is an important point since it suggests that _ these puzzling phenomena , observed by tem and ed techniques , do not occur in the case of bulk ceramics_. however , the tendency of pb ions to form four short bonds with oxygen is a feature observed through npd studies @xcite .",
    "this tendency is also seen from the models constructed to explain the observed ed patterns @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to note that similar conclusions were obtained through monte carlo simulations : @xmath29-like superlattice reflections are not present in pure bulk crystals but might be locally induced by surfaces over some range of temperature@xcite .",
    "classification of superlattice reflections commonly found in the rhombohedral phases of pzt by tem / ed studies .",
    "tilts refer to glazer notation@xcite .",
    "table is adapted from ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         rough but illustrative picture for this can be obtained by considering the tolerance factor @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the ionic radii for the @xmath11- and @xmath5-cations and oxygen . in the case of pbzro@xmath2 @xmath34 implying that the pb ions is not able to fill the cuboctahedra , whereas zr fills octahedra so tightly that it takes a larger share from the total volume by tilting the octahedra . in this sense",
    "one can construct pbzro@xmath2 by ( i ) considering the large zr ions , which results in a @xmath35 tilt corresponding to distorted oxygen octahedra and then ( ii ) displacing pb ions inside the cuboctahedra in such a way that four short , essentially covalent , bonds with oxygen ( constituting a pbo@xmath36 pyramid ) are formed .",
    "very similar situation occurs in a closely related pbhfo@xmath2 which is isostructural and has the same space group symmetry as pbzro@xmath2@xcite .",
    "for clarity it must be said that the given treatment is meant to be illustrative and not to give any causality relationships ( in ref .",
    "the type of octahedral tilting and deformation was seen as a way to accommodate the nature of the pb - o bonding ) .",
    "now , the pbo@xmath36 pyramids alternate in the @xmath37 plane in such a way that antiferroelectric ordering is formed . also the zr ions experience similar shifts , although the absolute variation in zr - o bonds ( at 100 k the shortest and largest zr - o bonds were 2.41 and 3.105  ) is not that large as in the case of pb - o bonds ( at 100 k the shortest and largest zr - o bonds were 2.044 and 2.205  ) .",
    "in contrast to pb ions zr ions exhibit anit - parallel @xmath23 $ ] shifts@xcite .",
    "also the behaviour of the pb(1 ) and pb(2 ) ions ( specified in table [ structuresummary ] versus temperature was found to be different .",
    "namely , at 100 k the pb(1 ) ion shift was significantly larger that of the pb(2 ) .",
    "thus changes in pb(1 ) position were larger than those of pb(2 ) once the cubic phase was approached .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of pb(1 ) three of the pb - o bonds in pbo@xmath36 pyramid were much shorter than the fourth one so that pb(1 ) is almost threefold coordinated .",
    "in this context it is worth to mention that @xmath38 and @xmath7 phases do not have group - subgroup relationship nor is common subgroup reported to exists between the two phases ( in contrast to the case of mpb ) .",
    "interestingly , there is a very narrow ( with respect to temperature and @xmath3 ) region where pbzro@xmath2 and pzt with very small amount of ti with @xmath38 symmetry transforms into ferroelectric rhombohedral phase at around 500 k. however , the stability region of this phase is very sensitive to impurities @xcite and pb ion positions are disordered @xcite . both phase transitions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are first order transitions ( first necessarily by the given symmetry arguments)@xcite . since the pb ion displacements from their ideal cubic sites are dominant in pbzro@xmath2 ( so that the pb ion are shifted with respect to the zr and oxygen ions , which remain at their ideal sites ) they essentially measure the sublattice polarization .",
    "thus it is possible to simplify the structural model which in turn allows one to write down a simple free energy expansion@xcite for pbzro@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , pb - ions displacements average out in tetragonal pzt so that there is no net polarization in @xmath37 plane .",
    "this is often modelled by assuming that the four @xmath41 sites , equivalent in the case of @xmath16 symmetry , are statictically occupied by pb ion ( this is contrasted to the case where pb ion is located at @xmath42 site and anisotropic adps are used ) .",
    "the structural models used in rietveld refinements take this into account by assuming that each site is occupied by a quarter of pb ion . in the case of pzt",
    "the four sites are not equivalent , but to a first approximation , the occupation probability of each site does depend on the local @xmath5-cation configuration ( how the eight nearest @xmath5 cation sites are occupied ) .",
    "thus , the pb - ion displacements are different in the case of zr- and ti - rich areas .",
    "@xmath15 symmetry allows that spontaneous polarization has a non - zero value in the @xmath43-axis direction . in the case of ideal symmetry",
    ", this corresponds to coherent pb - displacements .",
    "however , due to the local distortions following spatial composition variation ( and changes in bond lengths ) also other pb ion displacements ( local disorder ) must occur .",
    "thus , there is a delicate interplay between @xmath5-cations , oxygen octahedra tilts ( if any ) and the corresponding pb - ion displacements .",
    "it is not straightforward to say which displacement configuration is energetically the most favourable and is most reliably addressed through experiments .",
    "this is demonstrated by pbzro@xmath2 and pbhfo@xmath2 : due to the large space available for pb one can construct various hypotetical pbo@xmath36 configurations ( different from the experimental ones , such as a one corresponding to a ferroelectric ordering ) under the constraint that ions have their nominal valences .",
    "it is not obvious when a change to another structure would be favourable .",
    "these are aspects to be considered once new materials , such as multiferroics , are designed .",
    "pzt and ba(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( bzt ) systems provide interesting case study , since the changes in their electronic band structures versus @xmath3 are well documented . as was summarized in ref .",
    ", there are two main differences between pb perovskites and those containing closed - shell @xmath11-cations ( such as ba in the bzt system ) : ( i ) the band gap in pzt system is almost constant , being 3.45 ev in pbtio@xmath2 and 3.72 ev in pbzro@xmath2 whereas the band gaps in batio@xmath2 and bazro@xmath2 are 3.0 and 5.0 ev , respectively and ( ii ) the presence of shallow pb@xmath44 centers . to understand these observations , band structure computations and electron - paramagnetic - resonance ( epr ) spectroscopy studies",
    "were carried out for pzt system , reported in refs . and and summarized below . in bzt ,",
    "the valence band edge consists of o @xmath45 states and the conduction band consists of pure ti / zr @xmath46 states @xcite .",
    "the band gap increases in bzt with @xmath3 because the zr @xmath47 states lie 2 ev above the ti @xmath48 states and ba has little effect on the electronic structure because its states lie well away from the band gap . in pzt ,",
    "the valence band has essentially the same width and character for all @xmath3 , because this is determined by the pb @xmath49-o @xmath50 interaction .",
    "similarly to the case of bzt system , the ti / zr @xmath46 states increase rapidly in energy with @xmath3 .",
    "the tight - binding computations for cubic pbtio@xmath2 and pbzro@xmath2 revealed that the conduction band minimum is composed of the ti / zr @xmath46 states only at low zr compositions and switches to pb @xmath51 states with increasing @xmath3@xcite .",
    "shallow pb@xmath44 centers corresponds to a local state slightly above the valence band maximum .",
    "epr experiments revealed that the pb@xmath44 center acquires more pb @xmath51 character with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this was interpreted to be due to the local off - center displacement of the pb ion .",
    "thus , by lowering the symmetry of the center the @xmath50 character is introduced into its wavefunction .",
    "the pb@xmath44 hole trap binding energy was found to be between 0.14 and 0.26 ev @xcite .",
    "these finding were found to be consistent with raman scattering studies of pzt , nd - modified pbtio@xmath2 ( pnt ) and nd - modified pzt ( pnzt ) bulk ceramics using ultraviolet ( wavelength 363.79 nm which corresponds to 3.4 ev , close to the band gap energy ) and visible light ( wavelength 514.532 nm which corresponds to 2.4 ev)@xcite . in the case of uv light , several high - frequency modes above 1000 @xmath52 were observed .",
    "most interestingly , the frequency of the mode at around 1170 @xmath52 in pzt ceramics showed anomalous behaviour at the well - known phase transitions , corresponding to the changes in pb ion environment .",
    "the use of different systems ( pzt , pnt and pnzt ) allowed the assignment of these modes to an electronic processes in the pb@xmath44 hole traps@xcite , in contrast to zr and ti .",
    "once this information is combined with the pb ion displacements observed through npd studies one gains very consistent picture of these systems .",
    "now , these observations are important not only for the understanding factors affecting on switchable polarization in pb - perovskites , but also provide a physical model explaining the activation energies @xmath53 of conductivity in pzt .",
    "values between 0.15 and 0.18 ev were calculated for the @xmath53 assuming poole - frenkel mechanism for the conductivity @xcite . in",
    "many ways analogous situation appears in bi - perovskites , such as in ( bisco@xmath2)@xmath0-(pbtio@xmath2)@xmath0 ( bs - pt ) alloys@xcite .",
    "namely , the large polarization and piezoelectric responses in bs - pt system were found to be due to the bi / pb @xmath51-o @xmath45 hybridization@xcite .",
    "the pzt system is frequently assumed to be a binary solid solution of pbtio@xmath2 and pbzro@xmath2 _ without solubility gaps _ , as was summarized in ref . .",
    "according to ref .",
    ", once a solid solution is formed at high temperature ( typically above 800@xmath54c ) , the chemical composition can not be changed at low temperatures , but the system can have temperature - induced _ diffusionless _ structural phase transitions . the validity of this assumption has been questioned in refs . and and it was reported that pzt solutions exhibit a positive enthalpy of mixing that suggests _ a tendency towards immiscibility and phase decomposition_. thus , it was proposed@xcite that miscibility gaps replace the mpb and the paraelectric to ferroelectric transition lines of the diffusionless phase diagram given in ref .",
    "( which would be valid only if the cooling rate significantly exceeds the diffusion rate of ti and zr atoms ) .",
    "the analysis was restricted to temperatures above 420 k@xcite , although very similar conclusions should be valid at lower temperatures .",
    "usually the solubility gap increases with decreasing temperature . in the present case",
    "the solubility gap and finite atomic diffusion rate would imply that system minimizes its free energy by segregating into two different phases possessing different compositions and crystal symmetries .",
    "although it is probable that the equilibrium situation is not necessarily reached through standard sample preparation techniques , two - phase co - existence is apparent in the vicinity of the mpb . from the microscopic point of view",
    "this means that attention should be paid on how zr and ti ions are distributed over the @xmath5-cation site .",
    "this issue was recently addressed in ref . through monte carlo type model where the mean of the distribution of cluster volume was analysed as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "this study revealed that the sum of the mean cluster size of the zr and ti clusters is _ a minimum _ at @xmath55 , with the most likely minimum volume in which an equal number of zr and ti ions is found being 1 nm@xmath56 ( for clarity we point out that correspondingly there were many 1 nm@xmath56 volumes with inequal number of zr and ti ions ) .",
    "correspondingly , it was argued that the increase in coherence length of the nano - domains , proposed as the mechanism for the appearance of the macroscopic monoclinic phase close to @xmath55 in ref .",
    ", may be a consequence of some ordering of the @xmath5-cations . according to the model given in ref .",
    ", the local structures of the @xmath7 and @xmath16 phases were considered to be monoclinic and @xmath15 phase was interpreted to correspond to those composition and temperature values for which the local regions had grown sufficiently that diffraction techniques see a distinct @xmath15 phase . for the forthcoming discussion , it is important to notice that the spatial composition variation is larger the smaller the spatial length scale is , as is also apparent from fig . 13 in ref . .",
    "our next goal is to estimate the magnitude of the spatial composition variation in simplest terms and to relate it to the experimental observations on local and average structure .",
    "thus , we assume that the distribution of zr and ti is random . for discussion purposes",
    ", we further assume that the spatial composition can be divided into two parts : ( i ) differences between the average compositions of grains , consisted of domains and ( ii ) composition variation within a domain . to quantify the meaning of spatial composition variation within a domain",
    "we assume that the distribution of zr and ti obeys the binomial density function with probabilities @xmath57 and @xmath58 that the @xmath5-cation site is occupied by zr and ti ion , respectively ( the solubility gap would further enhance the spatial composition variation ) . in principle",
    ", ordering effects can be taken into account by introducing conditional probabilities .",
    "we believe that the present approximation provides a microscopic explanation for the two phase co - existence observed in the vicinity of the mpb and is consistent with the idea that @xmath15 phase serves as a transitional phase between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases .",
    "to see this , we consider the case of pzt with @xmath55 : if we divide a large domain ( say , with dimensions of the order of 1 @xmath59 m ) to cubes containing @xmath60 primitive cells , roughly @xmath61 of the cubes contain @xmath62 zr ions with @xmath63 .",
    "if we now take the cube edge to be 10 nm ( typical spot sizes used in tem and ed studies are between 1 and 5 nm ) , almost @xmath64 of the cubes have @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( for large values of @xmath60 binomial distribution can well be approximated by a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "spatial composition variation is the probable origin explaining why some domains are rhombohedral , whereas some are monoclinic . in a transition region",
    "( compositions between well established rhombohedral and tetragonal regions ) @xmath15 phase serves as a transition bridge .",
    "the idea of an inhomogeneous distribution of zr and ti ions is also consisted with the tem and ed observations according to which there is a rather large spatial variation in ed patterns as discussed above .",
    "surface phenomena are sensitive to local distortions .",
    "it is the feature of the binomial distribution that the variance is largest at around mpb composition ( @xmath67 ) and is zero only for pure pbtio@xmath2 and pbzro@xmath2 .",
    "this is seen from the line widths which increases with increasing @xmath3 when @xmath68 .",
    "this is supported by an atomic pair distribution function analysis carried out for pzt powders with @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite : the mpb is a crossover point with maximum disorder .",
    "it is also important to note that even if the average composition of different grains would be exactly the same , the spatial variation can correspond to domains with different symmetries . in practice ,",
    "some composition variation in average compositions of different domains and grains exists , as the above mentioned solubility gap suggests .",
    "also the composition of grain boundaries is expectably different from the inner parts .",
    "the most important factor behind the two - phase co - existences is probably related to the differences in average compositions of different domains : the domains with larger zr content can entirely transform to rhombohedral phase , while it looks that the phase transformation can not be completed in those domains containing larger amount of ti but is frozen to @xmath15 phase .",
    "we note that @xmath15 phase was interpreted to relieve the stress which otherwise would be generated due to the _ interacting _ rhombohedral and tetragonal domains in ref . .",
    "from this point of view it is not a surprise that the bragg reflections of the @xmath15 phase are much wider than those of the @xmath6 phase , and are dependent on temperature .",
    "it is our opinion that pzt with composition in the vicinity of the mpb ( and similar systems ) should be modelled as a two - phase system .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one could prepare an ideally ordered pzt sample with @xmath55 , @xmath15 phase might not be stable . to see this",
    ", we note that in the case of ordered pzt with @xmath55 the zr / ti distribution is homogeneous in the primitive cell scale and any deviation from this order results in less homogeneous distribution .",
    "correspondingly , there are no zr rich or deficient areas and in this sense also the mechanism favouring @xmath15 would be missing : if there are no local distortions due to the spatial composition variation , there likely are no domains with different symmetries ( at least not so abundant as the experiments reveal ) , which in turn implies that there is no need for a phase serving as a bridge between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases .",
    "this might be important for a very small grain size powders where most of the grains would be consisted of one domain .",
    "experimentally the two extrema cases , perfect disorder and order , can easily be distinguished by x - ray or neutron diffraction techniques . as the studies dedicated to double perovskites show , ordering is clearly seen from the superlattice reflections in x - ray ( for instance , see ref . where polymerized complex method was used to prepare ba@xmath71mnwo@xmath72 double perovskites ) and neutron powder diffraction patterns ( see , e.g. , ref . )",
    "also raman spectra are consisted with the observed diffraction patterns @xcite .",
    "as the numerous studies show the difference in ionic radii ( and , to a lesser extent , charge ) does not provide sufficient driving force for a formation of the double perovskite structure .",
    "as proposed in ref . , partial ordering may occur , although it is not easy to determine the degree of ordering in the present case .",
    "even though it may not be possible to prepare double perovskite pzt samples the problem can be approached by computational techniques .",
    "finite temperature monte carlo simulations carried out for pzt with a broad range of @xmath3 and random distribution of zr and ti in the @xmath5-cation site yielded a phase transition sequence @xmath73 @xcite ( no interaction between different domains was incorporated in this study ) .",
    "virtual crystal approximation ( vca , where zr and ti ions are replaced by the same fictitious average atom ) does not reveal a @xmath15 phase @xcite .",
    "it is an open question if vca could reproduce @xmath15 phase when the interaction between domains is taken into account .",
    "after all , @xmath15 phase always co - exists with rhombohedral phase .",
    "the two - phase co - existence in the vicinity of the mpb has proven to be very puzzling and sometimes one can find reports according to which an ideal sample preparation route could yield single phase samples .",
    "recently , an equilibrium phase diagram satifying the gibbs phase rule was given in ref . .",
    "the essential result was that , by the gibbs phase rule , the single - phase fields on the phase diagram must be separated by two - phase regions ( and @xmath15 phase is by no means an exception)@xcite . according to ref .",
    ", the flat energy surface near the rhombohedral phase may be the most important factor for high piezoelectric constant materials .",
    "as the co - existence suggests , this seems to be the case in pzt system .",
    "the anisotropic ( @xmath4-dependent ) line broadening was ascribed to a microstrain in ref . .",
    "there are several factors which together are responsible for the anisotropic line broadening : ( i ) zr substitution for ti creates local strains due to the size difference , ( ii ) spatial composition variation : zr - rich clusters take larger volume per formula unit than ti - rich clusters , and ( iii ) pb - ion shifts depend on the @xmath5-cation environment ( i.e. , pb - shifts vary spatially as a response to the spatial variation of the @xmath5-cations ) .",
    "although the given mechanisms are interweaved , the given division serves as a way to estimate which one is dominating at different composition regimes .",
    "thus , the changes in bragg reflection intensities and displacement parameters in the case of small zr / ti substitutions in pbtio@xmath2/pbzro@xmath2 can largely be understood by considering the mechanism ( i ) .",
    "thus , following the treatment given in ref .",
    ", small zr substitution for ti in pbtio@xmath2 might be treated by considering the concentration of zr atoms @xmath3 , the difference between matrix ( ti ) and solute ( zr ) atoms @xmath74 .",
    "now , the degree of distortion is characterized by the mean square atomic displacement @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a constant .",
    "static atomic displacements cause a reduction in diffraction peak intensity and increase in diffuse scattering and can be treated in the same way as thermal vibrations . however",
    ", this treatment is no more adequate for intermediate values of @xmath3 since there is no way of selecting such a matrix that experimentally observed features could be explained .",
    "although the mechanism ( i ) can explain changes in intensities ( matrix and solute atoms have different scattering lengths and cross sections ) and diffuse scattering ( seen as an increased intensity in the bragg reflection tail regions : the peak width at half maximum is practically not affected by this mechanism ) for small values of @xmath3 , it does not provide a model for changes in bragg reflection widths .",
    "this is why the phenomenological model given in ref .",
    "was adopted : it also takes into account the @xmath4-dependent bragg reflections widths by introducing a microstrain broadening @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "laue symmetry imposes restrictions on the allowed @xmath79 terms .",
    "expressions for @xmath80 for each laue symmetry are given in ref . .",
    "in addition , we note that rather strong intensity is commonly observed between the @xmath22 and @xmath21 with @xmath81 bragg reflections , which was assigned to locally disordered regions in the vicinity of the domains walls in ref . .",
    "especially at room temperature it is practically impossible to assign a precise structural model for this phase , since it is not well crystallized .",
    "it might also be a precursor phase which at higher zr contents evolves into a rhombohedral phase .",
    "this interpretation was given to the data collected on pht powders , see fig .",
    "4 in ref . .",
    "nevertheless , scattering from this phase adds intensity to certain diffraction peaks , which in practise also contributes to an asymmetric line broadening ( as it is not possible to unambiguously separate it : it is the sum from different contributions what one observes in the case of powder diffraction ) .",
    "for example , the larger and smaller @xmath46-spacings sides of the pseudo - cubic @xmath82 and @xmath83reflections , respectively , seem to gain intensity .",
    "particular care is necessary once this phase is modelled and generally one might do better by collecting data on samples with different zr contents and at different temperatures .",
    "although a reasonable structure refinements for medium resolution data collected on pzt samples with @xmath84 were obtained using a lineshape which ignored anisotropic line broadening , the situation was quite different for high resolution facilities , particularly once the data were collected on two phase samples .",
    "in such a case it was essential to use an appropriate profile function .",
    "_ now , when the anisotropic line broadening is neglected _ , the fit in the case of certain weak peaks becomes slightly worse ( as was observed to be the case of weak superlattice reflections , which are less weighted in the refinements ) .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated in fig . [ asymmetry ] : in order to improve the fit corresponding to the strong pseudo - cubic @xmath82 reflections , during the refinement the position of @xmath6 reflection is shifted toward higher @xmath46-spacings , which in turn resulted in a small shift of the weak peaks at 2.44 and 1.06  .",
    "the anisotropic line broadening was not limited to the @xmath46-spacing at around 2  , and similar mechanism was seen at other @xmath46-spacings . a structural model which reduces the symmetries to model",
    "the @xmath4-dependent line broadening takes local disorder into account incorrectly , since in this way the disorder is assigned to be periodical , obeying the space group symmetry .",

    "this allowed considerably simpler structural model : one is tempted to ask how much can be gained by first decreasing the symmetry from @xmath6 to @xmath17 and then decreasing the number of refinable parameters by introducing constraints .",
    "this issue is discussed on a more general ground in ref . .",
    "the use of @xmath17 phase was largely based on the tem and ed observations @xcite according to which superlattice reflections , which were inconsistent with @xmath6 symmetry , were observed at low temperature .",

    "( summarized above ) , and ( ii ) if the observed features are only characteristic to tem samples ( layers with thickness between 5 and 100 nm were studied and it was further stated that the size distribution of @xmath17 phase ranged between 3 to 10 nm@xcite .",
    "this is contrasted by the observation according to which the line widths of @xmath6 phase were much narrower than those of @xmath15 phase@xcite .",
    "neither of the phases was in a form of nanoparticles. it would also be interesting to see how large octahedral tilts are necessary to reproduce the ed patterns , including those superlattice reflections which were taken as an evidence for @xmath17 symmetry , since they were not observed by npd studies .",
    "it is an often overlooked issue that @xmath19 and @xmath104 models , given in refs . and respectively , are _ completely different _ ( and mutually exclusive ) : they present models where @xmath15 and @xmath17 symmetries were swapped .",
    "although this swapping might not be so obvious from studies solely based on tem / ed techniques it is clearly seen from x - ray powder diffraction and npd models . in the case of tem / ed techniques",
    "very small volumes are studied in a time ( this can also give wrong idea about the phase purity , i.e. , if the sample with macroscopic dimensions contains one or two phases ) and often no attempts to determine sufficiently accurate lattice parameter were done . whatever is the reason for overlooking this issue , this type of space group swapping results in entirely different structural parameters and phase fractions .",
    "needless to say , this has nothing to do with composition variation or differences in crystallite sizes , see also related discussion in ref . .",
    "despite the increased number of refined parameters , the residuals were still rather high and the differences between different models compared in ref .",
    "were marginal .",
    "for instance , @xmath105 was lowest for the @xmath96 model which was rejected in ref . .",
    "as discussed in the next section , the model given in ref . does not assign octahedral tilts to a correct phase . in constrast , the models proposed in refs . and assigned octahedral tilts to the same phase . in the case of the data shown in ref .",
    "the intensity of the peak(s ) at around @xmath106 was barely above the noise level and the @xmath19 model assigns more reflections than there are data points in this region .",
    "thus these reflections do not provide justification for the use of @xmath17 phase .",
    "in addition , some reports claimed that dielectric measurements gave support to @xmath17 phase ( for example , see ref . ) .",
    "although these types of measurements might be useful once phase transitions in single phase samples are studied , not too much emphasis should be put on data collected on multiphase samples . in this context",
    "we note that the samples studied in refs . and contained a nonidentified impurity phase(s ) , as was revealed by the peaks at around 28 and 35 two - theta degrees ( corresponding to @xmath46 spacings 3.18 and 2.56  , respectively ) , in addition to the aforementioned two - phase co - existence .",
    "this implies that the composition was not well known and thus the possibility of compositional and structural inhomogeneities should be kept in mind .",
    "although this non - perovskite phase was well resolved , it was not included in the rietveld refinement model considered in ref .",

    "although it is not sensitive for minor changes in symmetry , unless bond lengths are altered , it has proven to be useful for confirming the effect of the proposed pb , zr and ti ion displacements@xcite .",
    "namely , if pb ions are constrained to be located in their ideal positions in the case of @xmath16 phase , the pb ion valence would be @xmath132 , whereas it is quite close to the nominal valence @xmath133 once pb ions are allowed to be displaced towards @xmath13 directions .",

    "on the other hand , by constraining the @xmath5 cations to have the same fractional coordinates yielded negative adp values . allowing pb ions to be displaced towards @xmath13 directions and zr and ti ions to have different fractional @xmath137-coordinates resulted in physically reasonable adp values .",
    "from this point of view it was important to check the validity of the structural models by confirming that both anomalous valence and adp values can be eliminated by the same structural model .",
    "oxygen valences in pzt systems were close to their nominal valence value @xmath138 .",
    "also oxygen adp values were reasonable .",
    "thus , as far as npd studies are considered , it is a decent approximation to assume oxygen octahedra to fullfil the requirements of space group symmetry , in contrast to the case of cation positions .",
    "this also implied that it was not necessary to invoke the plausible mechanism , the expansion of zr octahedra and contraction of ti octahedra , to correct the anomalously large zr and small ti valences in the structural models used to model the npd data .",
    "bvs were found to be consistent with the observed phase transition sequences so that reasonable valence values for each ion were obtained also in the case of the @xmath15 and @xmath6 phases .",
    "the relationship between the oxygen octahedra and cuboctahedra volumes and octahedra tilts were pointed out in ref . .",
    "namely , @xmath6 symmetry allows oxygen octahedra tilt , which means that the volume of oxygen octahedra increases with increasing tilt angle .",
    "this in turn allows the valence of each ion to be close to their nominal values .",
    "the same is not possible in the case of @xmath7 symmetry and thus the observed oxygen octahedra tilts versus temperature and @xmath3 seen in the case of pzt samples with @xmath107 and @xmath85 are consistent with the constraints set by nominal valences@xcite . in many ways",
    "similar findings , based on density functional theory computations carried on pzt modelled with large supercells , were reported in ref . .",
    "perhaps the most essential difference between the typical rietveld refinement models and supercell models for pzts is that the space group symmetries used in the latter approach allow different size oxygen octahedra for zr and ti , whereas they are constrained to be the same in rietveld refinements ( one actually replaces both zr and ti by a pseudo - atom whose scattering length ( npd ) or cross section ( x - ray diffraction ) is a weighted average over zr and ti ions ) .",
    "this explains why the individual bond - valences for zr and ti were found to be close to their nominal values in the case of the supercell computations @xcite . in this sense",
    "it is surprising to see that both approaches support the idea that oxygen position do not suffer from local distortions to the extent cation positions do .",
    "the pitfalls related to the modelling of the crystal structures of pzt ceramics with different compositions and at different temperatures were reviewed .",
    "the role of the spatial composition variation , resulting in two - phase co - existence in the vicinity of the phase boundaries and anisotropic line broadening , were reviewed .",
    "the conditions set to sample preparation , powder diffraction instrument and line shape were addressed .",
    "focus was put on the structure analyses on pzt ceramics with compositions in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) .",
    "recent studies pointed out that the two - phase co - existence in the vicinity of the phase boundary is a thermodynamical necessity in pzt system and further is very crucial for the high electromechanical coupling coefficients observed in mpb compositions .",
    "two different approaches for modelling the two - phase structures of pzt ceramics with compositions corresponding to the mpb were identified .",
    "the first is a method were space group symmetry was decreased so that both local and average crystal symmetries were modelled , whereas the second method was based on the highest space group symmetry compatible with the observed bragg reflections and where local distortions were taken into account by selecting an appropriate line shape .",
    "recently published @xmath104 and @xmath19 structure models were compared with @xmath96 model where anisotropic line shapes were used . whereas @xmath96 model is a higher symmetry version of @xmath104 model , @xmath19 model was shown to be inapplicable .",
    "once the local distortions , resulting in anisotropic line broadening , are correctly taken into account , we do not find support for @xmath104 model .",
    "instead we found that @xmath96 model describes all bragg peaks and their intensities well .",
    "it was further shown that the @xmath96 model is consistent with the structural features observed at other compositions and temperatures , which is particularly important in the vicinity of the phase boundary .",
    "also issues related to the effects of a finite sample size used in transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction ( ed ) studies were discussed and it was pointed out that while locally ordered areas may occur in nanosize samples , resulting in additional reflections in ed patterns , they frequently do not appear in bulk samples .",
    "thus , the same structural model might not be valid for nanoscale and bulk samples .",
    "it was further pointed out that these features are not limited to mpb compositions .",
    "spatial variation of pb ions shifts follows from the spatial variation in the @xmath5-cation distribution .",

    "<S> the issues related to the structure refinement of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzt ) solid solutions are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid on the modelling of the co - existing phases in the vicinity of the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , where local symmetry is often significantly lower than the average symmetry . according to recent studies , </S>",
    "<S> two - phase co - existence in the vicinity of the mpb is a thermodynamical necessity . </S>",
    "<S> significantly different structural models for pzt with @xmath3 in the vicinity of the mpb have recently been published . </S>",
    "<S> structural models , based on x - ray , neutron and electron diffraction studies , are reviewed and two essentially different approaches were identified : ( i ) a method where space group symmetry was decreased untill the features due to the local distortions were modelled and ( ii ) a method where the highest space group symmetry compatible with the powder diffraction data was used together with a model for a local disorder . related to the method ( ii ) , the essential features of a model taking the @xmath4-dependent line broadening into account are summarized . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the cationic disorder is demonstrated by computing the variation in madelung energies due to the variation in structural parameters for pzt using experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying theme is to consider how local regions , with symmetry lower than the average symmetry , should be modelled . method ( i ) often introduces unjustified structural parameters and should be avoided . by studying the temperature and composition dependence of the structural parameters , including line shape parameters and phase fractions in the case of the two phase samples , one can further test the proposed models . </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the local structure for electrical properties ( switchable polarization and electrical conductivity ) is discussed by considering the local pb ion displacements and their dependence on the neighbouring @xmath5-cation configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the structure and piezoelectric properties , with emphasis on the co - existence of the rhombohedral and monoclinic phases , is discussed in light of the recent first - principles computational studies . </S>",
