    "the flow simulated is a turbulent boundary layer from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , where only the last fourth of the computational domain has been represented .",
    "the portion shown is @xmath3 wide and @xmath4 long .",
    "the visualized width corresponds with the simulated width , hence the contours are periodic in the spanwise direction .",
    "all the contours presented are coloured with the distance to the wall .",
    "the first scene corresponds to a contour for a value of enstrophy , defined as the magnitude of the vorticity fluctuations , equal to 10% the value at the wall .",
    "this value is one order of magnitude higher to what is usually taken as a threshold for the turbulent / nonturbulent interface , and tube - like structures are clearly seen in the region further from the wall .",
    "the same temporal evolution is repeated several times .    in the second scene the previous threshold is changed from 10% the value of the wall to 1% , a value that generates a connected and relatively smooth surface .",
    "this second value for the threshold is in the range of what is used to research the turbulent / nonturbulent interface as a surface ."
