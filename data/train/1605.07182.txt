    "a major goal of stellar astrophysics is to understand the early evolution of stars , before they reach a stable equilibrium on the main sequence . in theory , the fundamental parameters of mass , composition , and angular momentum uniquely determine the course of all stellar evolution , including the pre  main - sequence phase .",
    "binary stars are perhaps the most useful empirical calibrators available for testing stellar models , as their components share a common age and composition and dynamical masses can be derived from their orbital motion . while dozens of mass measurements have been obtained for pre ",
    "main - sequence stars ( e.g. , see reviews from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , most of these are for stars more massive than 0.5 .",
    "steady progress has been made to push measurements to lower masses . however , there are still only a handful of masses measured for stars at or below the 0.20.3  peak in the initial mass function , leaving pre",
    " main - sequence models for a large fraction of stars poorly constrained .",
    "previous work to measure the masses of pre  main - sequence stars has mostly focused on star forming regions , like the nearby taurus  auriga and scorpius  centaurus  lupus  crux complexes with ages of @xmath12110myr and distances of @xmath12150pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . over the last two decades",
    "a growing number of young stars much closer to the sun and with wider ranging ages ( @xmath128150myr ) have been identified .",
    "the proximity of these stars offers many benefits , including the possibility of spatially resolving binaries with smaller semimajor axes and correspondingly shorter orbital periods for dynamical mass determinations .",
    "lspm  j1314 + 1320  was first identified as a star exhibiting proper motion @xmath13200  by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included it as a candidate late - type star in their high angular resolution survey using lucky imaging at @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands , where their sample was selected from objects with red @xmath16 colors in the lspm catalog @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated a spectral type of m6 for lspm  j1314 + 1320  from its @xmath16 color and discovered that it was a binary with a separation of 130mas and flux ratios of @xmath17mag and @xmath18mag .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite had identified lspm  j1314 + 1320  as a potential nearby star with an estimated distance of 9.7pc , leading them to obtain spectra and astrometry that revealed a spectral type of m7 , h@xmath19 in emission , and a parallactic distance of @xmath20pc @xcite .",
    "they concluded that their original photometric distance estimate was much smaller than the parallactic distance due to unresolved binarity and/or extreme youth .    the first definitive evidence for the youth of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab came from analysis by @xcite of its published optical spectra and their own near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum , all spatially unresolved .",
    "these spectra display weak alkali lines , which are indicative of low surface gravity , and strong absorption .",
    "although @xcite had previously identified lspm  j1314 + 1320ab as a likely new member of the ab doradus moving group ( @xmath12150myr ) , subsequent analysis and updated proper motion data has led to the conclusion that it can not be confidently associated with any known group @xcite .",
    "@xcite has also identified lspm  j1314 + 1320ab as a source of bright ( @xmath121mjy ) , persistent radio emission with a flat spectrum across a wide range of frequencies ( 1.4322.5ghz ) , suggesting high levels of magnetic activity and a stable , large - scale magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "therefore , lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is potentially useful as a benchmark not only for evolutionary models but also for models of stellar magnetism .",
    "we present here spatially resolved relative astrometric monitoring of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab obtained with keck ao that allows us to determine its orbit and thereby its dynamical total mass ( ) .",
    "we combine our keck data with spatially resolved very long baseline array ( vlba ) absolute astrometry from a companion paper ( forbrich et al .",
    "2016 , submitted ; hereinafter paper  i ) to simultaneously model the orbital motion , proper motion , and parallax and thereby derive individual dynamical masses of @xmath211% precision .",
    "we confirm that lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is unambiguously in the pre  main - sequence phase of its evolution and use our dynamical masses to perform tests of models , examining properties such as luminosity , temperature , and lithium depletion .",
    "we have been monitoring the resolved orbital motion of both components of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab using keck adaptive optics ( ao ) with the facility nir camera nirc2 .",
    "we used both direct imaging and non - redundant aperture masking to measure the binary s separation , position angle ( pa ) , and flux ratio in @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "typical examples of our images and masking interferograms from each epoch are shown in figure  [ fig : keck ] .",
    "analysis of masking data was done using a pipeline similar to that in previous papers containing nirc2 masking data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is described in detail in section  2.2 of @xcite . for imaging data , we used the same methods described in our previous work ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "briefly , after a standard reduction of the images ( dark subtraction and flat fielding ) we fit a three - component two - dimensional gaussian model to the two binary components . for the last three epochs ,",
    "when the binary separation was widest , we were able to use the starfinder package instead .",
    "starfinder iteratively solves for both the binary parameters and an image of the point - spread function .",
    "we then corrected our derived @xmath24 positions using the nirc2 distortion solution of @xcite , which has a pixel scale of @xmath25maspixel@xmath26 and a @xmath27 offset added to the orientation given in the nirc2 image headers .",
    "the last epoch was obtained after a major realignment of the keck ao system on 2015  apr  13 .",
    "therefore , for this epoch , we used an updated distortion solution from service et al .",

    "table  [ tbl : keck ] summarizes the resolved astrometry and flux ratios derived from our keck observations . as an estimate of our uncertainties",
    ", we used the rms of the best - fit binary parameters at a given epoch across the multiple images or masking interferograms . to vet these errors",
    ", we performed a standard 7-parameter orbit least - squares fit ( see section  3.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to our keck astrometry .",
    "we found a value of @xmath30 for 7  degrees of freedom ( dof ) , which has a probability of @xmath31 , so we concluded that our keck astrometric errors are reasonable .",
    ", it is the probability of obtaining a value for @xmath32 as high or higher than the observed value given the degrees of freedom . ]",
    "our @xmath23-band flux ratios are somewhat inconsistent with being constant across all epochs , with @xmath33 ( 6  dof ) .",
    "to achieve @xmath34 , a systematic error of 0.011mag added in quadrature is required .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis we use @xmath35mag , which is the weighted average after adding this error floor in quadrature to the individual values .",
    "we conservatively use the rms of the measurements as the uncertainty since it encompasses both the fitting errors and the potential for variability .",
    "finally , we note that our infrared flux ratios seem to be at odds with the optical flux ratios of @xmath17mag and @xmath36mag from @xcite .",
    "however , for another binary in their survey , lhs  1901ab , they also report very unequal flux ratios ( @xmath37mag and @xmath38mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while ao imaging gives flux ratios in @xmath39 of @xmath80.1mag .",
    "this suggests that the apparent discrepancy may simply be due to systematic errors in the flux ratios derived from lucky imaging , so we do not use them in our analysis .",
    "we obtained optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab as part of larger follow - up program of nearby bright m  dwarfs from @xcite . in the optical we used the supernova integral field spectrograph ( snifs ;",

    "* ) on the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope on maunakea , hawaii , on 2015  jan  9  ut .",
    "snifs provides simultaneous coverage from 32009700  at a resolution of @xmath40 .",
    "details of our snifs observations and reduction can be found in @xcite and @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .",
    "the pipeline detailed in @xcite performs dark , bias , and flat - field corrections , cleaned the data of bad pixels and cosmic rays , then fits and extracts the integral field unit spaxels into a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the @xcite reduction takes this spectrum and performs flux calibration and telluric correction based on white dwarf standards taken throughout the night and a model of the atmosphere above maunakea .",
    "the final reduced spectrum of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab has a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath13100 per pixel redward of 6000 .",
    "we obtained a nir spectrum of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab using the spex spectrograph @xcite at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on maunakea , hawaii , on 2013  may  16  ut . our observations were taken in the short cross - dispersed ( sxd ) mode using the @xmath41 slit ( @xmath42 ) , yielding simultaneous coverage from 0.82.4 , with a small gap near 1.8  due to non - overlapping sxd orders .",
    "the target was placed at two positions along the slit ( a and b ) and observed in an abba pattern in order to subsequently subtract the sky background .",
    "six exposures were taken this way , yielding a snr @xmath43 per pixel in the @xmath44 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "to correct for telluric lines , we observed an a0v star immediately after the target .",
    "our spex spectrum was extracted using the spextool package @xcite , which performs flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and extraction of the one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "multiple exposures were combined using the ` xcombspec ` routine .",
    "a telluric correction spectrum was constructed from the a0v star and applied to the target spectrum using the ` xtellcor ` package @xcite .",
    "separate orders were stacked using the ` xcombspec ` tool , which also shifts the flux level in different orders to match each other .",
    "these corrections were 1% or less per order .",
    "we combined our keck / nirc2 relative astrometry of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab with vlba absolute astrometry from paper  i to perform a joint analysis of the orbit and parallax of the system .",
    "the vlba observations only detect one component of the binary at all epochs , and we identify it as the secondary component lspm  j1314 + 1320b ( defined as the component that is fainter in our @xmath22- and @xmath23-band keck data ) .",
    "this is because the orbital motion seen in the vlba data is to the northeast over 20132014 , and our keck astrometry over the same time period indicates that the secondary was moving to the northeast relative to the primary .",
    "in addition to our keck astrometry here , we also used results from @xcite who measured a binary separation of @xmath45mas and pa of @xmath46 from their lucky imaging data on 2005  jun  15  ut . the combined data set contains a total of 7  epochs of resolved astrometry spanning 10.03yr and 9  epochs of absolute astrometry spanning 4.65yr .",
    "our astrometric model includes 15 total parameters , and six of these are orbit parameters shared between the keck and vlba data .",
    "the six common parameters are orbital period ( @xmath47 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath48 ) , inclination ( @xmath49 ) , argument of periastron ( @xmath50 ) , mean longitude at the reference epoch ( @xmath51 ) , and pa of the ascending node ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we defined the reference epoch for our model as @xmath53jd ( i.e. , calendar date 2010.0 ) .",
    "the semimajor axes of the primary and secondary components about their barycenter are denoted @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . since our keck data measure relative orbital motion , the keck semimajor axis parameter was @xmath56 , while the vlba semimajor axis parameter was simply @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining parameters are only used to model the vlba data : ra and dec at the reference epoch ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) ; proper motion in ra and dec ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) ; parallax ( @xmath61 ) ; and systematic error parameters in ra and dec ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) .",
    "these vlba error parameters are needed to model systematic errors in the absolute astrometric calibration , which are expected to be comparable from epoch to epoch . in order to properly mitigate our model from preferring extremely large values of these error parameters",
    ", we penalized the logarithm of the likelihood by @xmath64 , where @xmath10 is the quadrature sum of both error parameters .",
    "the parallax factor at each epoch was calculated from the jpl ephemeris de405 as described in equations  1 and 2 of @xcite .    as in our previous work on joint analysis of relative and absolute astrometry @xcite",
    ", we used the affine invariant ensemble sampler ` emcee  v2.1.0 ` @xcite to perform our markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis .",
    "we used @xmath65 walkers ( chains ) with @xmath66 steps each , saving every 500th step for use in our analysis and removing the first 10% of all walkers as the burn - in portion .",
    "table  [ tbl : mcmc ] summarizes the resulting posterior distributions and the priors on all of our parameters .",
    "we report both the best - fit parameters and the credible intervals that encompass 68.3% and 95.4% of each parameter s posterior values .",
    "the best - fit parameters give a total @xmath67 for 19 dof , @xmath68 , including both the keck data and the vlba data with the systematic errors added in quadrature to the nominal vlba measurement errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbit ] displays this best - fit orbit and parallax solution alongside both the keck and vlba astrometry .",
    "table  [ tbl : mcmc ] also gives credible intervals and best - fit values for a number of additional parameters that can be derived directly from our fitted parameters , e.g. , the distance computed from the absolute vlba parallax ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "most notably , we compute a precise total system mass from the keck orbit and vlba parallax , @xmath70 , and individual masses for the components by combining the vlba and keck orbits ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) .",
    "because of the very high precision of the vlba parallax ( @xmath73 ) , the uncertainties in these masses are dominated by the uncertainty in the orbital period ( @xmath74 ) , total semimajor axis ( @xmath75 ) , and secondary semimajor axis ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "accounting for covariances between these parameters , the derived primary mass is the most precise ( @xmath77 ) , followed by the total mass ( @xmath78 ) and secondary mass ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the mass ratio ( @xmath80 ) is consistent with the radio - emitting secondary that is fainter in the nir being the less massive component , and 95.4% of our mcmc posterior values having @xmath81 .",
    "the derived primary and secondary masses are @xmath0(@xmath1 ) and @xmath2(@xmath3 ) , respectively .",
    "these individual masses are very nearly equal , within 2% of each other at 90% confidence . for additional discussion of the parallax and proper motion determined from this joint analysis",
    "see paper  i.      our new ao imaging allows us to compute resolved photometry for the two components of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab .",

    ", we computed resolved @xmath39 photometry for the components of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab . for the integrated - light photometry we used the 2mass point source catalog @xcite along with 2mass - to - mko photometric system conversions calculated from our spex spectrum .",
    "we list the resulting resolved and integrated - light photometry on both the mko and 2mass photometric systems in table  [ tbl : props ] .    in order to compute the bolometric flux of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab in integrated light , we combined and absolutely calibrated our optical and nir spectra following the method outlined in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we first collected published photometry from 2mass , sdss @xcite , the aavso all - sky photometric survey ( apass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "we converted this photometry to fluxes using the relevant zero - points , and we also calculated synthetic fluxes from our spectra using the corresponding filter profiles @xcite . at this point we noticed that the sdss @xmath49-band measurement was highly discrepant ( @xmath834mag ) with our spectrum and with the surrounding photometry , so we excluded it from our analysis . taking account of both random and correlated errors ( flux calibration and optical variability ) we scaled the optical and nir spectra to match the photometry and to match each other in the region overlapping between snifs and spex ( 0.800.95 ) .",
    "we replaced regions of high telluric contamination and those not covered by our spectra with a best - fit atmospheric model from the bt - settl grid @xcite , where the best - fit here was @xmath89k and @xmath90dex .",
    "the final calibrated and combined spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : lbol ] .",
    "we calculated the bolometric flux ( ) by integrating over the combined spectrum , accounting for errors in the flux calibration , optical variability of 1.5% @xcite , and errors introduced by replacing regions of spectra with a bt - settl model .",
    "this yielded @xmath91ergs@xmath26@xmath92 .",
    "we apportioned this integrated - light bolometric flux to the individual components by deriving a bolometric flux ratio from our @xmath23-band flux ratio .",
    "we examined bt - settl atmosphere models with @xmath932900k and @xmath905.0dex .",
    "relative to the best - fit @xmath89k and @xmath90dex model , the other five models had comparable or slightly larger amplitude @xmath23-band flux ratios spanning @xmath94mag to 0.12mag for hotter and cooler models , respectively . among these models , the relationship between their bolometric magnitude differences and @xmath23-band magnitude differences was consistently @xmath95mag . in comparison to our integrated - light bolometric magnitude error of 0.025mag ,",
    "the correction itself is small and the uncertainty in the correction is essentially negligible ( though we do account for it in our analysis ) .",
    "combining this correction factor with our @xmath23-band photometry , we find @xmath96dex , with the resultant individual luminosities given in table  [ tbl : props ] .",
    "we determined the integrated - light spectral type of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab from our optical and nir data .",
    "we compared our optical snifs spectrum to the m  dwarf spectral library of @xcite . to find a best fit spectral type and uncertainty we used the least - squares package mpfit in idl @xcite . in performing this fit",
    "we allowed the numerical spectral type to vary continuously , interpolating between standards to create the comparison spectra .",
    "we excluded wavelengths near h@xmath19 , allowed for a small wavelength shift to account for radial velocity , and neglect extinction given the small distance .",
    "we found a best fit spectral type for lspm  j1314 + 1320ab of m@xmath97 , and figure  [ fig : spt ] shows our data in comparison to the best - fit and adjacent spectral standards .",
    "we also used our spex sxd spectrum to determine a nir spectral type and gravity classification on the @xcite system .",
    "we find a spectral type of m@xmath98 ( figure  [ fig : ir - spt ] ) , consistent with our optical type and the previous determinations of m@xmath99 in the optical from @xcite and m6.5 in the nir from @xcite .",
    "the gravity classification is determined from the amount of deviation in certain spectral features from field objects of similar spectral type . if most features are consistent with the field ( i.e. , having a score of zero ) , then the classification is fld - g . if most features are deviant from the field indicating low gravity , then the classification is vl - g .",
    "intermediate cases are given the classification int - g .",
    "for lspm  j1314 + 1320 , only 3 scores are used to determine the gravity , since the strength of vo absorption is not applicable at this spectral type .",
    "based on the indices computed from our sxd spectrum ( table  [ tbl : grav ] ) , we found that feh was consisent with the field , most individual alkali lines were not strongly deviant from the field , and the @xmath44-band continuum was marginally inconsistent with the field .",
    "this results in a score of 0n01 and a formal classification of fld - g .",
    "however , a closer examination of the alkali lines leads to a more nuanced interpretation .",
    "of the four features used in the alkali score , the line at 1.169  was consistently indicative of low gravity .",
    "figure  [ fig : ir - grav ] shows all four alkali lines , and in fact all of them appear visually weaker than the field gravity m6 standard , consistent with the findings of @xcite from an independent spectrum . the other three are simply not weak enough to qualify as low gravity on the @xcite system .",
    "therefore , while the formal classification alone gives fld - g , we note that lspm  j1314 + 1320  is more faithfully described as having a spectrum on the borderline between fld - g  and int - g  classifications .",
    "finally , we also used the @xmath23-band portion of our spex spectrum to determine the metallicity of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab in integrated light . using the calibration of @xcite we found @xmath100 } = 0.04\\pm0.08$]dex ,",
    "i.e. , consistent with solar metallicity as assumed by theoretical models in the following analysis .",
    "we caution that this calibration was based on field objects and so might give a somewhat different value for [ fe / h ] than a relation based on low gravity dwarfs",
    ".      given our precisely determined individual masses and luminosities for the components of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab , we can uniquely infer other physical properties from evolutionary model tracks .",
    "we first interpolate the values of each physical parameter such as  from the bhac15 evolutionary tracks onto uniform , 2-d grids in log(mass ) and log ( ) , using grid steps of 0.01dex in both axes .",
    "we draw random , normally distributed values of the individual component s bolometric fluxes for each step in our mcmc chains .",
    "we then bilinearly interpolate each resultant pair of ( mass , ) from our chain on a given 2-d grid of parameter values to compute the posterior distributions of that parameter .",

    "the detection of lithium by @xcite in the combined light spectrum of these @xmath80.09  objects further supports the pre ",
    "main - sequence nature of this binary , as models predict lithium will be destroyed in objects of this mass hundreds of myr before they reach the main sequence .",
    "for very low - mass stars ( @xmath210.1 ) and high mass brown dwarfs , lithium is destroyed at a slow enough rate that it can be used to determine the ages of stellar associations up to at least @xmath12100myr .",
    "higher mass objects destroy their primordial lithium at a faster rate , so at older ages lithium disappears from the spectra of progressively lower mass objects .",
    "therefore , the brightest stars to display ( 6708 ) absorption in a given cluster define an empirical boundary that can be used as a relative age scale between different clusters , and evolutionary models can be used to infer absolute ages of individual clusters based on the location of this lithium depletion boundary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we therefore conclude that the lspm  j1314 + 1320ab does not belong to any known young association , despite being unambiguously pre  main - sequence and located at only 17.25pc .",

    "in practice , such a calculation is complicated by the fact that their measurements are made in integrated light , but for the sake of argument we will assume that they both correspond to one of the two components of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab .",
    "@xcite reported a rotation period of @xmath152hr from multi - epoch vla observations and a @xmath153  from optical spectroscopy .",
    "in optical photometric monitoring , @xcite find two distinct rotation periods of @xmath154hr and @xmath155hr and conclude that the cause of the two very similar but distinct periods is not clear .",
    "assuming @xmath156  and 3.8hr gives @xmath157 .",
    "this is consistent with the model - derived average @xmath158 , which would correspond to @xmath159 .",
    "interestingly , this value is in good agreement with the measured orbital inclination @xmath160 , which would be consistent with a stellar spin axis aligned with the orbital plane .",
    "however , it is also possible that the true radius is smaller or larger than predicted by models , corresponding to @xmath161  or @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "the bhac15 evolutionary models that we have used to derive stellar parameters like radius and  employ bt - settl model atmospheres as their boundary conditions for the surfaces of stars .",
    "therefore , we can test for consistency between the value of  derived from bhac15 and an independent estimate based on the spectrum of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab .",
    "direct fitting of our combined optical and nir spectrum with bt - settl models yields @xmath89k and @xmath90dex ( figure [ fig : btsettl ] ) , but these values necessarily lack in precision due to the somewhat coarse ( 100k , 0.5dex ) model grid steps .",

    ". moreover , using a spectral type  scale intended for higher gravity field dwarfs results in an even cooler , more inconsistent . ]    in the absence of additional information , it is equally possible that this  discrepancy could be caused by systematic errors in either or both of the evolutionary and atmosphere models .",
    "indeed , the bt - settl models do not fit the overall spectrum with high accuracy ( figure  [ fig : btsettl ] ) , implying that any temperature based on these models will harbor some systematic error .",
    "observations of other pre  main - sequence binaries at younger ages show discrepancies consistent with the 180k difference here .",
    "for example , @xcite found that for two unequal - mass m  dwarf binary systems in the 10-myr - old upper scorpius subgroup , the evolutionary model - derived temperatures were 100300k higher than model atmospheres .",
    "if the  discrepancy for lspm  j1314 + 1320ab were due to evolutionary models , then at fixed luminosity this would imply model radii that are too small by 13% .",
    "interestingly , there are other cases of pre  main - sequence m  dwarfs for which such under - predicted model radii can explain observed discrepancies .",
    "@xcite found that for the 10myr old m5 eclipsing binary uscoctio  5 , multiple evolutionary models ( including bhac15 ) underpredicted the component radii by 10%15% while simultaneously overpredicting  by @xmath8300k and thereby predicting consistent luminosities .",
    "in addition , evolutionary models of low - mass stars that include the effects of magnetic fields predict larger radii due a slowing down of their contraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , both observations and theory suggest that the dominant source of the  discrepancy we observe for lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is most likely due to evolutionary model radii , although we note that spectral type  scale could still harbor systematic errors .",
    "lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is much older than other pre  main - sequence systems with dynamical mass measurements in nearby star - forming regions , implying that the same qualitative radius/  problem with evolutionary models extends to ages of at least @xmath1280myr .      to our knowledge , this is the first mass measurement for an ultracool dwarf ( spectral type @xmath165m7 ) with spectral signatures of lower surface gravity than typical field objects . in section  [ sec :",
    "spt ] , we classified the integrated - light spectrum as fld - g , but on the borderline of being int - g , and both @xcite and we note the presence of spectral features indicative of lower surface gravity relative to field dwarfs of similar spectral type .",

    "if the model radii are too small by 13% as suggested above , then the model - derived gravities would be 0.1dex lower .",
    "overall , this implies that the borderline between fld - g  and int - g  designations for late - m dwarfs corresponds to a surface gravity @xmath80.5dex lower than field objects .    while the lspm  j1314 + 1320ab system itself does not belong to an association of independently determined age , numerous other ultracool dwarfs with gravity classifications do",

    "of 17 possible candidate members none are classified fld - g .",
    "moreover , @xcite report gravity classifications for eight ultracool dwarfs in the pleiades ; none were fld - g , and the two m7 dwarfs ppl  1 and teide  1 were int - g  and vl - g , respectively .",
    "these comparisons imply that spectral signatures leading to int - gand vl - g  classifications are typically still quite entrenched at ages significantly older than lspm  j1314 + 1320ab . at even younger ages , e.g. , tuc - hor ( 50myr ) and @xmath147  pic ( 23myr )",
    ", no known members are classified as fld - g  either ( e.g. , see compilation of liu et al .  2016 ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that lspm  j1314 + 1320ab has a gravity classification of fld - g  is at odds with its model - derived age of @xmath5myr and that our lithium analysis that empirically places the system at a significantly younger age than the pleiades .",
    "we suggest a few possible explanations for the fact that lspm  j1314 + 1320ab shows less distinct evidence for low gravity than older ultracool dwarfs .",
    "perhaps it is not that uncommon for late - m dwarfs to have more muted gravity signatures than l  dwarfs , and the existing samples of ultracool dwarfs are too sparse to detect this yet .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the currently available infrared spectra of pleiades late - m dwarfs are of much lower s / n than was used to define the gravity classification system , so higher quality spectra may result in somewhat different , higher gravity , classifications .",
    "the classification of lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is done in integrated light , so perhaps the gravity signatures are somehow obscured in combined light .",
    "@xcite tested such an idea , mostly using vl - gtemplates for components , and found that it is quite rare for two components to be classified as lower gravity in combined light . finally , maybe some third parameter is at work , e.g. , metallicity or rotation , causing the gravity classification to deviate slightly from other young ultracool dwarfs .",
    "our spectrum shows no signs of unusual metallicity , and it also seems unlikely that such a young object would different substantially in composition from other young associations in the solar neighborhood .",

    "as mentioned above , the spectral type  scale for young objects from @xcite gives @xmath163k , and they estimate a systematic error of 100k for their  scale , which we adopt here .",

    "we found an h - r diagram derived average component mass of @xmath171 , age of @xmath172myr , and  of @xmath173dex .",
    "this would imply that lspm  j1314 + 1320ab is actually a pair of young brown dwarfs , due to the h - r diagram derived mass being @xmath9% ( 2.0@xmath10 ) smaller than our directly measured component masses of @xmath892 .",
    "the h - r diagram age is also much smaller ( @xmath174dex ) than the age derived from the same models using mass and .",
    "as expected , the mass and age posteriors derived from the h - r diagram are highly correlated , where lower masses correspond to younger ages .",
    "the discrepancy between the h - r diagram derived mass and our dynamically measured masses suggests either large errors in the spectral type  relations , which are calibrated using bt - settl model atmospheres , systematic errors in the evolutionary models , or some combination of both things . as we discuss in section  [ sec : teff ] , we suggest the dominant source of this discrepancy is that evolutionary model radii are underpredicted and  is thereby overpredicted at a given luminosity . regardless of the cause of the discrepancy , this test case shows that masses derived from the h - r diagram can harbor large systematic errors .",
    "unfortunately , this method is often the only practical option when attempting to infer masses of stars and brown dwarfs in young associations where age can be uncertain due to potential underlying age spreads",
    ". therefore , the systematic error we have identified here will have significant implications for efforts to determine the low - mass end of the initial mass function , suggesting that young low - mass stars may be mistakenly identified as young brown dwarfs .",

    "these masses and parallactic distance are made possible by a joint analysis of our resolved relative astrometry of the primary and secondary from keck ao imaging and masking along with absolute astrometry from vlba radio interferometry of the secondary ( i.e. , the component that is fainter in the optical and infrared ) .",

    "the measured component masses of @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2  ( @xmath3 ) and luminosities of @xmath175dex and @xmath176dex , respectively , are consistent with being coeval at an age of @xmath5myr according to bhac15 evolutionary models .",
