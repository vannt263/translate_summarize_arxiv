    "the general solution for eq . in the @xmath103 region can be written as @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 being constants and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the bessel functions of first and second kind , respectively . upon replacing @xmath68 in the boundary condition ,",
    "we obtain @xmath109 ,    \\label{eq : bcf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 in eq .",
    ", @xmath111 is divergent if @xmath112 , hence @xmath106 must be zero . on the other hand , @xmath111 is finite for @xmath113 , it means that there arises the contribution of the irregular solution @xmath114 . here , the presence of an irregular solution contributing to the wave function stems from the fact the hamiltonian @xmath115 is not a self - adjoint operator when @xmath113 ( cf . , section [ sec : selfae ] ) , hence such irregular solution must be associated with a self - adjoint extension of the operator @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath113 , we have @xmath116 and by substituting the values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 into above expression we find @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 since a @xmath100 function is a very short range potential , it follows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath68 for @xmath123 is given by @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a scattering phase shift .",
    "the phase shift is a measure of the argument difference to the asymptotic behavior of the solution @xmath126 of the radial free equation which is regular at the origin . by using the asymptotic behavior of the bessel functions @xcite into eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath127 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by comparing the above expression with eq . , we found @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the usual phase shift of the ab scattering and @xmath130 therefore , the scattering operator @xmath131 ( @xmath2-matrix ) for the self - adjoint extension is @xmath132.\\ ] ] using eq . , we have @xmath133 .",
    "\\label{eq : smatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , for any value of the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath95 , there is an additional scattering .",
    "if @xmath134 , we achieve the corresponding result for the usual ab problem with dirichlet boundary condition ; in this case , we recover the expression for the scattering matrix found in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath135 .",
    "if we make @xmath136 , we get @xmath137 .    in accordance with the general theory of scattering , the poles of the @xmath2-matrix in the upper half of the complex plane",
    "@xcite determine the positions of the bound states in the energy scale .",
    "these poles occur in the denominator of with the replacement @xmath138 , @xmath139 solving the above equation for @xmath140 , we found the bound state energy @xmath141^{1/|m+\\alpha| } ,    \\label{eq : energy_bg - sc}\\ ] ] for @xmath142 .",
    "hence , the poles of the scattering matrix only occur for negative values of the self - adjoint extension parameter . in this latter case",
    ", the scattering operator can be expressed in terms of the bound state energy @xmath143.\\ ] ]    the scattering amplitude @xmath144 can be obtained using the standard methods of scattering theory , namely @xmath145        -1      \\right ) e^{im\\varphi}.      \\label{eq : scattamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation we can see that the scattering amplitude differ from the usual ab scattering amplitude off a thin solenoid because it is energy dependent ( cf . , eq . ) .",
    "the only length scale in the nonrelativistic problem is set by @xmath146 , so it follows that the scattering amplitude would be a function of the angle alone , multiplied by @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "this statement is the manifestation of the helicity conservation @xcite .",
    "so , one would to expect the commutator of the hamiltonian with the helicity operator , @xmath147 , to be zero .",
    "however , when calculated , one finds that @xmath148=e   \\varepsilon    \\left (      \\begin{array}{cc }        0 & ( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b } )        ( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\pi } ) \\\\        ( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{b } )        ( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\pi } ) & 0      \\end{array }    \\right),\\ ] ] which is nonzero for @xmath149 .",
    "so , the inevitable failure of helicity conservation expressed in eq .",
    "follow directly from the deformation parameter @xmath1 and it must be related with the self - adjoint extension parameter , because the scattering amplitude depend on @xmath95 . indeed , as it was shown in @xcite it is possible to find a relation between the self - adjoint extension parameter and the coupling constant @xmath150 in . by direct inspection we can claim that such relation is @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a very small radius smaller than the compton wave length @xmath153 of the electron @xcite , which comes from the regularization of the @xmath100 function ( for detailed analysis see @xcite ) .",
    "the above relation is only valid for @xmath142 ( when we have scattering and bound states ) , consequently we have @xmath154 and due to @xmath113 it is sufficient to consider @xmath155 to guarantee @xmath95 to be negative .",
    "a necessary condition for a @xmath100 function generates an attractive potential , which is able to support bound states , is that the coupling constant must be negative .",
    "thus , the existence of bound states requires @xmath156 also , it seems from the above equation and from that we must have @xmath157 and there is a minimum value for the magnetic flux @xmath158 .",
    "it is worthwhile observe that bound states and additional scattering still remain inclusive when @xmath159 , i.e. , no quantum deformation case , because the condition @xmath160 is satisfied , as it is evident from .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , let us comeback to helicity conservation problem .",
    "in fact , the failure of helicity conservation expressed in eq . , it stems from the fact that the @xmath100 function singularity make the hamiltonian and the helicity non self - adjoint operators @xcite , hence their commutation must be analyzed carefully by considering first the correspondent self - adjoint extensions and after that compute the commutation relation , as we explain below . by expressing the helicity operator in terms of the variables used in , we attain @xmath161 this operator suffers from the same disease as the hamiltonian operator in the interval @xmath113 , i.e.",
    ", it is not self - adjoint @xcite . despite that on a finite interval",
    "@xmath162 $ ] , @xmath163 is a self - adjoint operator with domain in the functions satisfying @xmath164 , it does not admit a self - adjoint extension on the interval @xmath165 @xcite , and consequently it can be not conserved , thus the helicity conservation is broken due to the presence of the singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "we have studied the ab problem within the framework of @xmath0-deformed schrdinger - pauli equation . the new contribution to the pauli s term",
    "is used to impose a upper bound in the deformation parameter , @xmath166 .",
    "it has been shown that there is an additional scattering for any value of the self - adjoint extension parameter and for negative values there is non - zero energy bound states .",
    "on the other hand , the scattering amplitude show a energy dependency , it stems from the fact that the helicity operator and the hamiltonian do not to commute .",
    "these results could be compared with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where a relation between the self - adjoint extension parameter and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath167 was obtained .",
    "the usual schrdinger - pauli equation with @xmath39 is supersymmetric @xcite and consequently it admits zero energy bound states @xcite .",
    "however , in the @xmath0-deformed schrdinger - pauli equation @xmath168 and supersymmetry is broken , giving rise to non - zero energy bound states .",
    "changes in the helicity in a magnetic field represent a measure of the departure of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron or muon from the dirac value of @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "hence , the helicity nonconservation is related to nonvanishing value of @xmath170 .",
