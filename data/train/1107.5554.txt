    "this led to extensions of the swift - hohenberg equation to account for these effects  @xcite .",
    "the mean flow is a weak horizontal flow field that acts over length scales larger than that of the convection rolls ; it results from the coupling to fluid vertical vorticity and is induced by roll curvature , amplitude gradients , and wavenumber gradients  @xcite .",
