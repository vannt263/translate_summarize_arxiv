    "the excitation was performed using a frequency filtered ti : sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 80mhz . for measurements of @xmath1 the count rate per detector ranged from @xmath62 to @xmath63 counts per second , depending on the laser and qd - cavity detuning .",
    "therefore , the integration time per datapoint ranged from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . for the measurements of @xmath38 the integration time was @xmath66 hours per datapoint .",
    "the expression @xmath67 is commonly used to describe the second - order field autocorrelation of a given light beam . following loudon @xcite",
    ", we first discuss the validity of this expression as used in the context of our pulsed excitation scheme and mention that it is somewhat incomplete .",
    "a semiclassical treatment of photodetection defines the measured degree of second - order coherence at zero time delay as @xmath68 , which is the normalized second order factorial moment of the time integrated photocount distribution @xmath69 . in analogy to the classical integrated mean intensity , the quantum mechanical operator @xmath70 represents the total photon number arriving at an ideal detector over the time interval @xmath71 $ ] , such that @xmath72. here , @xmath73 is the instantaneous field mode operator describing the field flux - it is important to note its distinction with the cavity field mode operator @xmath74 : @xmath73 describes a field flux while @xmath74 describes a field . comparing our semiclassical definition of @xmath1 to the quantum mechanical operator @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the quantum mechanical expectation value of the normally ordered second moment of the photon number operator . writing out this expression explicitly @xmath78 and substituting the un - normalized correlation moments for the expectation values , we arrive at @xmath79 therefore , the measured @xmath1 actually represents a quantity other than that which @xmath80 would suggest . instead of representing the correlation between two photon number ( fock ) states - states that incidentally do not exist in free space - @xmath1 represents the sum of all field flux correlations @xmath81 over the detection time .",
    "in other words , @xmath80 operates only on states which are well defined in a cavity whereas the correlation measurements are performed on fluxes .",
    "however , input - output theory provides a direct connection between the internal and external mode operators such that measuring zero delay flux correlations is equivalent to calculating @xmath82 inside the cavity .",
    "assuming the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and a rotating reference frame relative to the laser field ( frequency @xmath83 ) , the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian describing interaction of our strongly coupled system with a laser pulse takes the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the dipole operators , @xmath10 is the cavity mode operator , and @xmath86 the slowly varying field - cavity coupling amplitude . the self - energies and their shifts in the rotating frame",
    "are defined by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath9 are the atomic and cavity energies , respectively .",
    "we take the laser pulse as a gaussian , well described by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the pulse parameter . in simulations ,",
    "we find that @xmath92 results in correlations that closely match the observed experimental data .",
    "additionally , we assume that the cavity decay , @xmath6 , dominates the loss dynamics because the quantum dot lifetime is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the cavity lifetime .",
    "obtained using the quantum regression theorem ( solid lines ) and quantum jump method ( red data points ) for a qd - cavity detuning of ( a ) @xmath39 and ( b ) @xmath40 ]    the simulations presented in this paper are performed using the quantum optics toolbox in python ( qutip ) @xcite . to simulate the second order correlation function",
    "two different approaches are used : the quantum regression theorem and the quantum jump method .",
    "application of the quantum regression theorem to a problem of the form @xmath93 yields the following result @xmath94 where @xmath95 is governed by the following evolution equation @xmath96 subject to the initial condition @xmath97 after careful time - ordering @xcite , equation [ eq : g2x ] has the same form as equation [ eq : qrt ] and thus the implementation of the quantum regression theorem for the calculation of @xmath1 is straightforward .    in the quantum jump method , quantum trajectories that are solutions for our system s associated stochastic schrdinger equation are calculated .",
    "monitoring collapse events of the cavity field over many trajectories generates the expected photocount distribution that would be measured by an ideal , infinite bandwidth detector placed directly at the cavity output . from this distribution , we directly compute the normalised second order factorial moment in order to simulate our experimentally measured @xmath98 .    while using the quantum regression theorem results in a faster simulation of @xmath1",
    ", the quantum jump method additionally provides explicitly the probabilities for @xmath0 photons per pulse being transmitted through the cavity . to validate that the quantum jump method works well in our case and that we have simulated a sufficiently large number of quantum trajectories , we present in figure [ figure : s1 ] simulated values of @xmath1 as a function of the laser detuning for two different qd - cavity detunings ( c.f .",

    "clearly , both methods produce excellent agreement .",
    "furthermore , we note that because the correlation functions describing photon statistics are robust to loss and our detectors have finite detection probability paired with low photon coincidence probability , the experimentally measured and normalized coincidences from the hbt setup should very closely match these simulated values .",
    "+ for the simulations presented throughout this letter , we used the experimentally extracted cavity field decay rate @xmath99 and coupling strength @xmath100 .",
    "the qd decay rate @xmath17 plays almost no role for the detunings investigated here as it is negligible due to a long intrinsic lifetime that is even further purcell suppressed ( as will be discussed in detail below ) .",
    "therefore , the only parameter that can not be measured directly is the excitation power ( coherent scattering of the laser at high powers prevents referencing to a saturation value ) .",

    "is depicted as @xmath101 in order to minimize overlap . ]    using the liouville equation , dissipation can be introduced into the jc hamiltonian , resulting in complex energies of the jc system that read @xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 corresponds to the @xmath0th rung of the system . the real part of @xmath103 yields the energies of the states whereas the imaginary part yields their linewidths .",
    "interestingly , all four parameters @xmath6 , @xmath17 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 contribute to the polariton splittings and linewidths .",
    "additionally , it can be seen from equation [ eq : en ] that the detuning between different rungs scales with @xmath45 while the linewidth scales with @xmath0 .",
    "this can be easily understood : the decay rate of a certain rung is proportional to the number of photons involved .",
    "most strikingly , for the case of qds and photonic crystal cavities with @xmath104 , the linewidth of a given polariton branch closer to the bare qd ( bare cavity ) at nonzero detuning is smaller ( larger ) than at resonance .",
    "this is particularly important for photon - blockade phenomena that rely on the absence of an energetic overlap between transitions from the crystal ground state to the first rung and transitions from the first rung to higher rungs . therefore , detuning the cavity and qd not only increases the energy difference between transitions involving different rungs but also decreases the linewidth of the polariton branches closer to the bare qd transition , thus further enhancing the fidelity of photon - blockade .",
    "the dependence of the transition linewidths on the detuning is visualised in figure [ figure : s2 ] .",
    "the figure presents in panel ( a ) the jc ladder , in ( b ) the transition energies for an @xmath0-photon excitation of the @xmath0-th rung and in ( c ) the transition energies for subsequent excitations .",
    "here , the linewidths are indicated by the coloured areas . note",
    "that due to the large overlap of some transitions for this figure , we took the artistic liberty to colour with the artificially low cavity decay rate of @xmath105 , corresponding to a strongly coupled system with state - of - the - art parameters .",
    "while in our experiments the cavity decay rate is larger , the same dependence on the qd - cavity detuning applies .",
    "it is important to note that also for detuned strongly coupled systems the emission from the emitter - like polariton branch occurs almost exclusively through the cavity mode .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : as the emitter is embedded in a photonic band - gap material , its emission into free - space modes through non - cavity channels is strongly purcell suppressed . for the photonic crystal geometries used in our work , measured values of this emission rate are suppressed to approximately one tenth of their bulk value @xcite . as a result of this extreme time - scale disparity , the emission of the emitter through the detuned cavity mode obtained from equation [ eq : en ] dominates for detunings up to @xmath106 .",
    "this value is much larger than the detunings of a few @xmath5 as investigated in our letter .",
    "therefore , the emission occurs almost exclusively through the cavity .",

    "in figure 3 of the main text we have compared the probability of finding @xmath35 photons in a pulse transmitted through the cavity . in particular",
    ", we found that the probability for obtaining a single photon increases when increasing the detuning from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "however , as the oscillator strength of the qd - like polariton branch decreases with increasing detuning as discussed above , for too large detunings the probability of finding a single photon in the output decreases . to visualise this , we present in figure [",
    "figure : s3]a @xmath1 and in [ figure : s3]b @xmath36 as a function of the laser detuning for a qd - cavity detuning of @xmath107 ( black ) , @xmath108 ( red ) and @xmath109 ( blue ) . while for @xmath110 @xmath1 is close to the value obtained at @xmath111 , @xmath36 ( and thus the efficiency for single - photon generation ) decreases to one eight of the value at @xmath111 .",

    "( c - d ) examples of measurements of @xmath1 using @xmath113 long pulses and a detuning of ( c ) @xmath114 and ( d ) @xmath115 . ]",
    "due to a short cavity lifetime that is much shorter than the timing jitter of the single photon counters , measurements of @xmath1 can only be performed with pulsed excitation . as discussed in the main text , the choice of pulse length forces a compromise between frequency resolution ( reducing the overlap of different rungs ) and re - excitation of the system . in other words , if the laser pulses are too long the system will be re - excited during the interaction with a single pulse , reducing the non - classical character of the transmitted light . on the other hand , pulses with a shorter duration are spectrally broader , resulting in a larger overlap with higher rungs .",
    "the dependence of the radiative polariton lifetimes on the qd - cavity detuning is calculated by using equation [ eq : en ] with the measured values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( figure [ figure : s4]a ) . with increasing detuning between qd and cavity , the lifetime of the emitter - like ( cavity - like ) polariton branch increases ( decreases ) . therefore , in order to obtain the strongest photon - blockade the pulse length has to be chosen according to the detuning . to demonstrate the existence of an optimum pulse length for a given detuning between qd and cavity , we present in figure [ figure : s4]b simulations of @xmath1 as a function of the pulse length and laser detuning for a qd - cavity detuning of @xmath114 . with longer excitation pulses",
    "the photon - blockade dip narrows and @xmath1 decreases , reaching its lowest values for pulse lengths of @xmath116 . as mentioned in the main text , for detunings of @xmath33 we were able to obtain lower values of @xmath1 using a pulse duration of @xmath117 instead of @xmath118 .",

    "<S> this counter - intuitive finding that the efficiency of single - photon generation increases when detuning cavity and qd can be understood in the following way : photon - blockade is obtained if the first rung of the jc ladder is excited while the overlap of the laser with higher rungs is suppressed . when on - resonance this suppression is inherently limited by the linewidth of the transitions , that scales with @xmath0 as the decay rate of a rung is proportional of the number of photons . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the detuning of subsequent rungs scales with @xmath45 ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for any system parameters @xmath6 and @xmath5 that can be achieved with the emitter and cavity in resonance , there will always be an overlap between the transition to the first rung and to higher climbs up the ladder . as a result , the strongest photon - blockade with the emitter and cavity in resonance is not observed for the laser exactly on resonance with the first rung of the jc - ladder ( @xmath46 ) , but rather with the laser off - resonant and detuned to @xmath47 ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : g3 ] - left ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , if the separation between different jc rungs is enhanced by detuning the emitter and cavity , the strongest photon - blockade is obtained with the laser resonant with the polariton branch , making photon - blockade more efficient than in the resonant case . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only the purity but also the efficiency of single - photon generation improves given the correct detuning between cavity and emitter . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing detuning between the qd and cavity , the oscillator strength of the more qd - like polariton branch decreases as the oscillator strength of the qd is much weaker than the one of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for too large detunings the efficiency decreases , resulting in an _ optimum detuning _ for single - photon generation of a few @xmath5 ( see supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach to photon - blockade has strong potential for single - photon generation under already achievable system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> improvements in the spatial alignment of the qd and cavity field have enabled the coupling strength to reach values up to @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent nanofabrication improvements have allowed for experimental gaas photonic crystal cavity loss rates as low as @xmath49@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when using these parameters in our simulations we obtain @xmath50 in the photon - blockade regime , and an absolute probability of over @xmath51 for single - photon emission , demonstrating that high - quality single - photon streams generated by photon - blockade are within reach .    in summary , we have demonstrated that qd - cavity detuning is a key ingredient for high - purity generation of non - classical light from strongly coupled systems . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that detuning strongly reduces the spectral overlap with higher rungs of the jaynes - cummings - ladder and hence greatly improves the generation of single photons by photon - blockade . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented quantum - optical simulations that are in excellent agreement with our measurements and show that high - quality single - photon generation under photon - blockade is possible with current state - of - the - art samples . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of single photons by photon - blockade might have advantages over other techniques . </S>",
    "<S> first , the use of high quality photonic crystal cavities promises a method of on - chip routing of the photons by coupling them to photonic crystal waveguides ( with high efficiency ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the cavity emission rate is at least one order of magnitude faster than the bare qd emission rate , resulting in a comparable increase in the maximum single - photon generation rate while maintaining potential advantages from resonant excitation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the successful experimental demonstration of photon - blockade in the detuned light - matter configuration demonstrates the feasibility of operating cavity qed in such an extreme regime and paves the way for a wealth of other quantum light sources , including those generating @xmath0-photon states @xcite .    </S>",
