    "when developing underground physics laboratories it is need to take into account the factors which contribute in background environment .",
    "one such factor is neutrons which are produced by natural radioactive u - th chains in surrounding rocks . at depths which are high enough ( 2000  m.w.e . and more )",
    "the intensity of cosmic ray muons decreases down to @xmath610@xmath7  @xmath4s@xmath5 which is comparable to the background neutron flux from crystalline rocks .",
    "thus , at high depths a relative contribution of neutrons to background of physics experiments may appear to be considerable .",
    "estimation of this contribution into background can be based on calculation of flux using the measured concentrations of u - th and chemical composition of surrounding mine rocks .",
    "direct measurement of the spectrum and flux of background neutrons is important too .",
    "however , a low neutron flux is very difficult to be measured .",
    "several research groups have investigated the neutron background at different underground laboratories  @xcite .",
    "some of them used @xmath8li - dopped liquid scintillator technique  @xcite and others used in addition a pulse shape discrimination technique  @xcite .",
    "the fluxes of @xmath610@xmath9  @xmath4s@xmath5 in the energy range @xmath102  mev were measured there . sometimes a radiochemical technique was used there  @xcite .    in the institute for nuclear research , moscow ,",
    "the neutron spectrometer was developed and built which is sensitive to such a low neutron fluxes .",
    "the measurements of fast neutron flux in several underground rooms of baksan neutrino observatory ( bno ) , sage  @xcite and dulb  @xcite , have been performed with the spectrometer .",
    "these rooms are located under mt .",
    "andyrchy ( northen caucasus mountains , russia ) in a tunnel that penetrates 4.5  km into the mountain , at a depth of 4700 and 4900 meters of water equivalent accordingly .",
    "the fluxes of @xmath610@xmath7  @xmath4s@xmath5 in the energy range @xmath101.5  mev were measured there successfully .",
    "the series of neutron flux measurement were carried out according to agreement for a joint russian - finnish scientific research programme in 20002002 between the institute for nuclear research of the russian academy of sciences ( project sage ) and the oulu southern institute of the university of oulu ( project cupp , http://www.cupp.oulu.fi ) at underground facilities of the pyhsalmi mine , town pyhjrvi , finland .",
    "we present the results here .",
    "the detection part of the spectrometer ( detector ) consists of a liquid organic scintillator viewed by three photomultipliers ( pmt ) and nineteen proportional counters filled with @xmath11he ( neutron counters  nc ) and distributed uniformly over the scintillator .",
    "figure  [ det ] shows a general view of the detector .",
    "it was described initially in  @xcite .",
    "the housing of the detector is made of stainless steel .",
    "the space of cylinder tank ( diameter of 360@xmath12360  mm long ) available for the scintillator is about 30  l. to enhance light collection the wall and bottom of the scintillator tank are coated with a fluoroplastic .",
    "each counter in the tank is coated with aluminium foil too .",
    "the illuminator is made of organic glass and is covered by fluoroplastic plate with windows intended to improve the light collection and to secure the phototubes .",
    "the external surface of the tank is 6267  @xmath13 .",
    "fast neutrons ( @xmath101  mev ) entering the scintillator are decelerated down to a thermal energy and diffuse in the detector until they are either captured in a neutron counter or captured by scintillator protons or leave the detector .",
    "the intensity of light flash combined from recoil protons which are produced during neutron thermalization is on average proportional to the initial neutron energy .",
    "a portion of thermalized neutrons are captured by @xmath11he nuclei in the neutron counters , which emit charged particles via the reaction @xmath11he(n , p)t , e@xmath14=574  kev , e@xmath15=191  kev .",
    "thus , a signature of such event is a light flash in the scintillator followed by capture in the neutron counter after some time of delay .",
    "this delay is conditioned by the mean lifetime of thermalized neutrons inside the detector and is determined mainly by the detector design . for this particular detector t@xmath16 is @xmath650  @xmath17s .",
    "this technique allows one to suppress the natural background of @xmath18-rays significantly , by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the functional diagram of the data acquisition system is shown on figure  [ syst ] . in order to simplify the apparatus design",
    "the signals from all pmts and ncs are mixed into two independent channels called `` pmt channel '' and `` nc channel '' respectively .",
    "the circuit design of the low - level signal electronics are selected taking into account an optimal signal - to - noise ratio . to reduce the noise , the main amplification of initial signals is accomplished with the preamplifiers before joining .        at the pmt channel a negative signal from anode of the pmts is entered to the input of preamplifier ( pa ) .",
    "a continuously adjusted pa gain ensures the operation of all three pmts from a single high - voltage power supply .",
    "the pmt signal from pa output is multiplexed by a fast inverting linear mixer and then is distributed on two directions .",
    "one branch entered directly to the input of first channel of digital oscilloscope ( do ) .",
    "the other one is entered to the input of combined unit of amplifier and single - channel analyzer ( sca ) . the positive ttl - specified signal from sca output",
    "triggers the do through an external trigger input at the `` spectrum acquisition mode '' ( see below ) which is used in calibration procedures , control of the system operation stability and background rate monitoring during acquisition .    in the nc channel",
    ", a high voltage of positive polarity from a single source is applied through high - voltage isolating resistors to the anodes of helium counters .",
    "the anode generates signal of negative polarity which is fed through high - voltage separating capacitors to the input of pa .",
    "the spread of the counter gas amplification factor is compensated by adjusting the pa gain during calibration . for convenient channel tuning each of counter pa ( similarly to the pmt channel ) can be switched off independently by turning off the pa supply voltages .",
    "the signal of neutron counter pa outputs are multiplexed in a single output fast inverting linear mixer and subsequently enter directly to the input of the second channel of do . a signal from nc channel triggers the data acquisition system at the `` pulse acquisition mode '' which is usually used for real background measurements .",
    "the full waveform of event in the pmt and nc channels is recorded independently by means of the two - channel pc / at - interfaced digital oscilloscope la - n10m5 manufactured by `` rudnev - shilyaev '' co. , moscow , russia .",
    "it s performance data are shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the frame is recorded in selected time interval including periods before and after the trigger which are called prehistory and history accordingly .",
    "this time interval can be adjusted in the acquisition algorithm over the wide range ( 2  @xmath17s to 2  ms ) .",
    "usually the trigger , that is a capture in @xmath11he counter , is put in the middle of scope frame ( @xmath19160 to 160  @xmath17s ) .",
    "thus , the prompt pmt event being correlated with the @xmath11he count should appear before it in the interval @xmath19160 to 0  @xmath17s and uncorrelated one may appear elsewhere with the flat probability over the whole frame .",
    "parameters are presented as for 2-channel ( 1-channel ) mode .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     at 400 m level one can see significant excess in the energy region @xmath1025  mev .",
    "an obvious reason is a production of neutrons in hadron showers generated by cosmic muons in the lead shielding .",
    "muon induced neutrons mostly have an evaporating spectrum that is their energy lies in the range 110  mev , and in principle can be measured in the detector .",
    "but in this case the energy released by evaporated neutrons in the scintillator is accompanied with and usually much less than the energy deposited by muon induced hadron showers .",
    "so , it ca nt be distinguished . nevertheless , we put those neutrons in high energy released region just to separate from other ones .",
    "significant excess of neutrons at 1410  m can be easily reasoned by higher contamination of u / th in the decorative granite powder covering the walls of the room where the measurement was done .",
