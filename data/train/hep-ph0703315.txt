    "recently , the diffractive processes are attracting much attention as a way of amplifying the physics programme at proton colliders , including new channels searching for new physics .",
    "the investigation of these reactions at high energies gives important information on the structure of hadrons and their interaction mechanisms .",
    "hard diffractive processes , such as the diffractive production of massive electroweak bosons and dijets , allow the study of the interplay of small- and large - distance dynamics within qcd .",
    "the existence of a hard scale provides the normalization of the born term diagram . for boson hadroproduction ,",
    "single - diffractive dissociation can occur characterized by the existence of one large rapidity gap , which can be represented by the pomeron exchange . at high energies ,",
    "there are important contributions from unitarization effects and the suppression of the single - pomeron born cross section due to the multi - pomeron contributions depends , in general , on the particular hard process . at the tevatron energy , @xmath2  tev , the suppression is in the range 0.050.2  @xcite , whereas for lhc energy , @xmath3 tev , the suppression appears to be of order 0.080.1  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the correct treatment of the multiple scattering effects is crucial for the reliability of the theoretical predictions of the cross sections for these diffractive processes .    in the present study , our motivation to perform a new analysis on diffractive boson production is twofold : produce updated theoretical estimations compatible with the current tevatron data on single diffractive @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction @xcite and to perform reliable predictions to the future measurements at the lhc . in order to do so",
    ", we use regge factorization ( single pomeron exchange ) and the corresponding corrections for multiple - pomeron scatterings .",
    "factorization for diffractive hard scattering is equivalent to the hard - scattering aspects of the ingelman and schlein model @xcite , where diffractive scattering is attributed to the exchange of a pomeron , i.e. a colorless object with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the pomeron is treated like a real particle , and one considers that a diffractive electron - proton collision is due to an electron - pomeron collision and that a diffractive proton - proton collision is due to a proton - pomeron collision .",
    "therefore , the diffractive hard cross sections are obtained as a product of a hard - scattering coefficient , a known pomeron - proton coupling , and parton densities in the pomeron .",
    "the parton densities in the pomeron have been sistematicaly extracted from diffractive dis measurements . in particular , the quark singlet and gluon content of the pomeron is obtained from the diffractive struture function @xmath4 .",
    "recently , a new analysis of these diffractive parton distributions has been presented @xcite by the h1 collaboration in desy - hera . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the single pomeron approach produces results that overestimate the experimental values by a large factor @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present analysis the corresponding multiple pomeron exchange corrections will be taken into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the main formulae to compute the inclusive and diffractive cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 hadroproduction .",
    "we show the details concerning the parameterization for the diffractive partons distribution in the pomeron , extracted recently in desy - hera .",
    "in addition , we present the theoretical estimations for the gap survival propability factor that will be used in the comparison of our results with experimental measurements from tevatron and extrapolations to the lhc energy . in the last section we present our numerical results and perform predictions to future measurements in cern lhc experiment .",
    "the compatibility with data is analysed , possible additional corrections are investigated and the comparison with other approaches are considered .",
    "let us start by introducing the main expressions to compute the inclusive and diffractive cross sections .",
    "for the _ hard _ diffractive processes we will consider the ingelman - schlein ( is ) picture @xcite , where the pomeron structure ( quark and gluon content ) is probed .",
    "the starting point is the generic cross section for a process in which partons of two hadrons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , interact to produce a massive electroweak boson , @xmath7 , @xmath8\\,x)}{d\\hat{t}}\\ , , \\label{gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the parton distribution function of a parton of flavour @xmath10 in the hadron @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 gives the elementary hard cross section of the corresponding subprocess and @xmath13 is the hard scale in which the pdf s are evolved in the qcd evolution .",
    "equation above express the usual leading - order qcd procedure to obtain the non - diffractive cross section .",
    "next - to - leading - order contributions are not essential for the present purposes .    in order to obtain the corresponding expression for diffractive processes",
    ", one assumes that one of the hadrons , say hadron @xmath5 , emits a pomeron whose partons interact with partons of the hadron @xmath6 .",
    "thus the parton distribution @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) is replaced by the convolution between a distribution of partons in the pomeron , @xmath15 , and the  emission rate \" of pomerons by the hadron , @xmath16 .",
    "the last quantity , @xmath16 , is the pomeron flux factor and its explicit formulation is described in terms of regge theory .",
    "therefore , we can rewrite the parton distribution as @xmath17 and , now defining @xmath18 , one obtains @xmath19    concerning the @xmath20 diffractive production , one considers the reaction @xmath21 , assuming that a pomeron emitted by a proton in the positive @xmath22 direction interacts with a @xmath23 ( or a @xmath24 ) producing @xmath20 that subsequently decays into @xmath25 .",
    "the detection of this reaction is triggered by the lepton ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) that appears boosted towards negative @xmath28 ( rapidity ) in coincidence with a rapidity gap in the right hemisphere .    by using the same concept of the convoluted structure function ,",
    "the diffractive ( single diffraction , sd ) cross section for the inclusive lepton production for this process becomes    @xmath29\\ \\frac{\\hat{t}^2 } { \\sqrt{a^2 - 1 } } \\label{dsw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 , \\label{xaw}\\ ] ] @xmath31 , \\label{xbw}\\ ] ] and @xmath32 \\label{tw}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the lepton transverse energy , @xmath35 is the fermi constant and the hard scale @xmath36 .",

    ", the cross section for the diffractive hadroproduction of neutral weak vector boson @xmath1 is given by    @xmath45\\,\\frac{d\\hat{\\sigma}(ab\\rightarrow zx ) } { d\\hat{t}}\\ , , \\label{dsz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the weinberg or weak - mixing angle .",
    "the definitions for @xmath48 are similar as for the @xmath0 case and now @xmath49 .",
    "the values of the electroweak parameters that appear in the various formulae were taken from the particle data handbook @xcite , and we use only four flavors ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) in the weak mixing matrix , with the cabibbo angle @xmath54 .",
    "an important element in the calculation of hard diffractive cross sections is the pomeron flux factor , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ convol ] ) .",
    "we take the experimental analysis of the diffractive structure function @xcite , where the @xmath55 dependence is parameterised using a flux factor motivated by regge theory @xcite , @xmath56 where the pomeron trajectory is assumed to be linear , @xmath57 , and the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 and their uncertainties are obtained from fits to h1 fps data @xcite .",
    "the normalisation parameter @xmath60 is chosen such that @xmath61 at @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the minimum kinematically accessible value of @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the proton mass and @xmath66 is the limit of the measurement .",
    "the flux factor above corresponds to the standard pomeron flux from regge phenomenology , based on the donnachie - landshoff model @xcite . on the other hand , there is an alternative pomeron flux , proposed first by goulianos @xcite , which considers it as a probability density .",
    "thus , the integral over the diffractive phase space could not exceed the unit and the standard flux should be normalized .",
    "for instance , see refs .",
    "@xcite for previous phenomenology using the normalized flux in boson hadroproduction .",
    "hadroproduction at @xmath67 tev ( see text ) . ]      in the estimates for the diffractive cross sections , we will consider the diffractive pdf s recently obtained by the h1 collaboration at desy - hera @xcite .",
    "the pomeron structure function has been modeled in terms of a light flavour singlet distribution @xmath68 , consisting of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks and anti - quarks with @xmath69 , and a gluon distribution @xmath70 . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton entering the hard sub - process with respect to the diffractive exchange , such that @xmath71 for the lowest order quark - parton model process , whereas @xmath72 for higher order processes .",

    "the charm and beauty quarks are treated as massive , appearing via boson gluon fusion - type processes up to order @xmath76 . to determine experimentally the diffractive pdf s ,",
    "the following cuts have been considered : @xmath77 , @xmath78 gev and @xmath79 gev@xmath80 , mostly in order to avoid regions influenced by higher twist contributions or large theoretical uncertainties @xcite .    for the quark singlet distribution ,",
    "the data require the inclusion of all three parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 in equation  [ param : general ] . by comparison ,",
    "the gluon density is weakly constrained by the data , which are found to be insensitive to the @xmath84 parameter . the gluon density is thus parameterised at @xmath73 using only the @xmath85 and @xmath86 parameters . with this parameterisation",
    ", one has the value @xmath87 and it is referred to as the ` h1 2006 dpdf fit a ' .",
    "it is verified that the fit procedure is not sensitive to the gluon pdf and a new adjust was done with @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the gluon density is then a simple constant at the starting scale for evolution , which was chosen to be @xmath89 and it is referred to as the ` h1 2006 dpdf fit b ' .",
    "the quark singlet distribution is well constrained , with an uncertainty of typically @xmath90 and good agreement between the results of both fits @xcite .      in the following analysis",
    "we will consider the suppression of the hard diffractive cross section by multi - pomeron scattering effects .",
    "this is taken into account through a gap survival probability factor",
    ". there has been large interest in the probability of rapidity gaps in high energy interactions to survive as they may be populated by secondary particles generated by rescattering processes .",
    "this effect can be described in terms of screening or absorptive corrections , which can be estimated using the quantity @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the amplitude , in the impact parameter space , of the particular process of interest at center - of - mass energy @xmath93 .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 is the opacity ( or optical density ) of the interaction of the incoming hadrons .",
    "this suppression factor of a hard process accompanied by a rapidity gap depends not only on the probability of the initial state survive , but is sensitive to the spatial distribution of partons inside the incoming hadrons , and thus on the dynamics of the whole diffractive part of the scattering matrix .    for our purpose ,",
    "we consider two theoretical estimates for the suppression factor .",
    "the first one is the work of ref .",
    "@xcite ( labeled kmr ) , which considers a two - channel eikonal model that embodies pion - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory , diffractive dissociation and rescattering effects . the survival probability is computed for single , central and double diffractive processes at several energies , assuming that the spatial distribution in impact parameter space is driven by the slope @xmath6 of the pomeron - proton vertex .",
    "we will consider the results for single diffractive processes with @xmath95 gev@xmath96 ( slope of the electromagnetic proton form factor ) and without @xmath97 excitation , which is relevant to a forward proton spectrometer ( fps ) measurement .",
    "thus , we have @xmath98 for @xmath67 tev ( tevatron ) and @xmath99 for @xmath3 tev ( lhc ) .",
    "the second theoretical estimate for the gap factor is from ref .",
    "@xcite ( labeled glm ) , which considers a single channel eikonal approach .",
    "we take the case where the soft input is obtained directly from the measured values of @xmath100 , @xmath101 and hard radius @xmath102 .",
    "then , one has @xmath103 for @xmath67 tev ( tevatron ) and @xmath104 for @xmath3 tev ( lhc ) .",
    "we quote ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed comparison between the two approaches and further discussions on model dependence of inputs and consideration of multi - channel calculations .",
    "it should be stressed that our particular choice by kmr and glm ( single channel ) models is in order to indicate the uncertainty ( model dependence ) of the soft interaction effects .",
    "it is worth to mention that some implementations of glm model include the results of a two or three channel calculation for @xmath105 , which are considerably smaller than the one channel result @xcite .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] data versus model predictions for diffractive @xmath20 hadroproduction ( cuts @xmath106 gev and @xmath107 ) .

    "( [ dsz ] ) , producing a diffractive rate of 6.2 % .",
    "this value is once again higher than the tevatron data by a factor five .",
    "when considering the gap survival correction , we verify an agreement with experiment . for the total @xmath108",
    "we obtain a diffractive rate of 0.66 % using the kmr estimate for @xmath105 , whereas it reaches 0.76 % for the glm estimate .",
    "the average value gives @xmath109 , which is consistent with the experimental result @xmath110 .",
    "a rough extrapolation to lhc energy gives @xmath111 with kmr gap factor and @xmath112 for glm , with a mean value @xmath113 .",
    "we again consider the conservative cuts @xmath114 gev and @xmath107 .",
    "this estimate follows similar trend as for the @xmath0 case .",
    "the results presented above are summarized in table ii .",
    "the experimental errors have been summed into quadrature .",
    "our results can be compared with previous calculations in diffractive boson hadroproduction .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite one uses is approach with a normalized pomeron flux @xcite and the corresponding diffractive pdf s .",
    "the data description for the @xmath0 case is reasonable .",
    "however , the calculations are only compared to the cdf @xcite data and they are somewhat larger than ours . in ref .",
    "@xcite a hard pomeron flux is considered , i.e. @xmath115 , and multiple scatterings are taken into account by a monte carlo calculation .",
    "in addition , for tevatron energies the reggeon contribution is added .",
    "the results are compared only to cdf data @xcite for the @xmath0 production and the description is consistent with experiment .",
    "it is interesting the fact that a hard pomeron flux could mimic the multi - pomeron suppression or the effect of normalizing the standard pomeron flux .",
    "finally , we need call attention to the uncertainty in the determination of the gap survival probability . the estimates considered here ( kmr and glm ) are compatible with each other for the case of single diffractive processes .",
    "however , recent calculations using one channel eikonal model give larger values for @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite an eikonal qcd model with a dynamical gluon mass ( dgm ) was considered . using a gluon mass @xmath116 mev ,",
    "one obtains @xmath117  % and @xmath118  % .",
    "these values give @xmath119  % and @xmath120 % .",
    "this illustrates the size of uncertainty when considering different estimates for the gap probability .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to obtain a reasonable overall description of hard diffractive hadroproduction of massive gauge bosons by the model based on regge factorization supplemented by gap survival factor .",
    "for the pomeron model , we take the recent h1 diffractive parton density functions extracted from their measurement of @xmath121 . the results are directly dependent on the quark singlet distribution in the pomeron .",
    "we did not observe large discrepancy in using the different fit procedure for diffractive pdf s ( fit a and b ) .",
    "we estimate the multiple interaction corrections taking the theoretical prediction of distinct multi - channel models , where the gap factor decreases on energy . that is , @xmath122 % for tevatron energies going down to @xmath123 % at lhc energy .",
    "we find that the ratio of diffractive to non - diffractive boson production is in good agreement with the cdf and d0 data when considering these corrections .",
    "the overall diffractive ratio for @xmath67 tev ( tevatron ) is of order 1 % .",
    "in addition , we make predictions which could be compared to future measurements at lhc .",
    "the estimates give large rates of diffractive events , reaching values higher than 30  % of the inclusive cross section .",
