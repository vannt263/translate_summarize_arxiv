    "after the seminal discovery of ferromagnetism in gaas : mn @xcite with a critical temperature @xmath5 as high as 110 k there is worldwide a renewed interest in diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "recently , the curie temperature in gaas : mn could be pushed to values of about 180 k by a careful control of the annealing conditions during the growth process . @xcite there is a great search activity to look for alternative materials , especially in the class of ii - vi semiconductors ( sc ) .",
    "ferromagnetism ( fm ) in diluted ii - vi sc is known for a long time with up to now low @xmath5 values , however .",
    "@xcite they also serve as model materials since they allow to control the magnetic ions and the doped charge carriers independently . in such a way it was possible to demonstrate the carrier - induced mechanism of the ferromagnetic state in pb - doped snte : mn @xcite or in @xmath6-doped znte : mn . @xcite    the dms combine ferromagnetism with the conductivity properties of semiconductors . therefore , they are ideal materials for applications in spintronics where not only the electron charge but also the spin of the charge carrier is used for information processing .",
    "for instance , they allow to resolve the conductivity mismatch problem which hinders a high polarizability of injected electrons in a ferromagnetic metal / semiconductor junction .",
    "@xcite    the ferromagnetism in the traditionally known dms arises due to zener s @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange mechanism .",
    "@xcite the 3@xmath4 transition metal impurities lead to localized spins @xmath7 .",
    "hole doping into the valence band ( either by the 3@xmath4 transition metals itself or by other acceptor impurities ) provides charge carries whose spins interact with the 3@xmath4 spins .",
    "this local @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange coupling @xmath8 leads to a parallel arrangements of the magnetic moments since a ferromagnetic state allows a higher mobility of the doped holes .",
    "for a high doping level the material becomes more metallic and the mechanism changes to a rkky - like interaction",
    ".    from this argumentation follows immediately that the crucial parameter to increase @xmath5 is the @xmath9 coupling .",
    "indeed , a simple theory of zener s @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange mechanism @xcite gives @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hole doping level .",
    "it can be expected from general grounds that a decreasing anion - cation distance leads to an increase of the @xmath6-@xmath4 tight - binding hopping parameter @xmath12 , and consequently to an increase of @xmath9 .",
    "that reasoning lead dietl _",
    "et al _ @xcite to the proposal of room temperature ferromagnetism in mn - doped zno or gan , respectively , which created a tremendous activity and numerous reports on room temperature fm in ii - vi dms or similar materials . @xcite    however , there are serious doubts whether the reported room temperature ferromagnetism belongs really to the same class of ferromagnetism as that one observed in gaas : mn or znte : mn which is based on zener s @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange mechanism .",
    "for instance , in zno : co ferromagnetism was reported in samples produced by laser ablation,@xcite or by the sol - gel method,@xcite whereas other samples fabricated by precursor deposition,@xcite or molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) @xcite showed no signs of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetic couplings between nearest neighbor @xmath13 spins .",
    "it is highly probable that the observed ferromagnetic effects in zno : co are due to uncompensated spins at the surface of co - rich antiferromagnetic nanoclusters .",
    "@xcite    the proposal of dietl _ et al _ @xcite was based on simple model calculations and qualitative arguments .",
    "there is a real need for a parameter free _ ab - initio _ study of the relevant exchange parameters in ii - vi semiconductors to put the expected chemical tendency on a firm basis .",
    "such a calculation of the nearest neighbor couplings of local spins @xmath0 and the @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange couplings @xmath9 and @xmath14 with valence and conduction bands , respectively , is presented here .",
    "we considered the series of co- and mn - doped zna with the anions a = te , se , s and o.    to achieve our goal we had to solve two theoretical problems .",
    "first of all , the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) is not sufficient .",
    "it leads to wrong predictions of fm in zno : co even without additional hole doping , @xcite to too large values of @xmath15 for zno : mn , and to the wrong ( fm ) sign of one of the two nearest neighbor exchange couplings in wurtzite zno : co .",
    "@xcite it was shown that this deficiency of lsda can be repaired by taking into account the strong coulomb correlation in the 3@xmath4 shell by the lsda+@xmath3 method . to choose the @xmath3 values we have to take into account that they decrease in the series from o to te due to an increase of screening effects .",
    "the values of @xmath0 are very well known experimentally in this series .",
    "therefore they can be used to check the chosen @xmath3 values .",
    "we will show below that for reasonable values of @xmath3 we obtain @xmath0 in good agreement with experimental results and we may explain the chemical tendency .",
    "the second theoretical problem concerns the @xmath6-@xmath4 exchange coupling between the localized spins and the holes in the valence band @xmath9 .",
    "this coupling leads to the giant zeemann effect @xcite and it is seen in our calculations by a band - offset @xmath16 between spin up and spin down of the valence band . for small values of @xmath9 ( which means also small values of @xmath12 ) both splittings , the experimental and the theoretical one , are proportional to the magnetic impurity concentration @xmath17",
    ". in that weak coupling regime the @xmath6-@xmath4 coupling can be simply calculated by using the proportionality between splitting and @xmath17 .",
    "we will show , however , that there are more and more deviations from @xmath18 if we go from znte to zno .",
    "the exchange values obtained in that manner seem to depend on the concentration of magnetic impurities .",
    "we solve that problem by a fit to the wigner - seitz approach of benoit a la guillaume _ et al_. @xcite our results prove that we reach the strong coupling limit for zno .",
    "as we will show below , in that case the impurity potential is so strong that it can bind a hole for zno : mn , whereas zno : co is close to the localized limit .",
    "our ab - initio results strengthen the recent model calculations in ref .  .",
    "that work was aimed to explain the tremendous difference between the experimental @xmath9 values obtained from photoemission and magneto - optics , especially in zno and gan .",
    "@xcite it was argumented that this difference arises due to state localization which is confirmed by our ab - inito calculations below .",
    "but we also will show that our results for @xmath19 are much smaller than those evaluated earlier from photoemission for zno : mn ( -2.7 ev ( ref .  ) or -3.0 ev ( ref .  ) ) and zno : co ( -3.4 ev ( ref .  ) ) and which were used as model input parameters in ref .  .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . after presenting the super - cell method in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the nearest neighbor exchange coupling in sec .",
    "that fixes the @xmath3 values unambiguously . in sec .",
    "iv we present our results for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . finally , in sec .",
    "v we discuss the arguments in favor of a localized state in zno : mn .",
    "we used super - cell calculations to determine the exchange couplings @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the chemical tendency within the ii - vi series we restrict our study to the zinc - blende structure .",
    "all compounds of the series exist in that modification , even zno as epitaxial layer . to calculate @xmath0 we used super - cells of the form t@xmath22zn@xmath23a@xmath24 with the transition metals t = co or mn and with the anions a = o , s , se , and te . in those super - cells the magnetic ions build chains .",
    "the exchange constants are then determined by comparing the total energies of ferro- and antiferromagnetic arrangements .",
    "we have checked that the influence of finite size effects is negligible ( not larger than 6 per cent for @xmath0 ) by performing some calculations with t@xmath22zn@xmath25a@xmath26 super - cells .    for @xmath9 we used super - cells with three different concentrations of magnetic ions , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , i.e. tzn@xmath30a@xmath31 , tzn@xmath32a@xmath24 and tzn@xmath33a@xmath34 .",
    "as will be explained below , these numerical results have to be fitted with the wigner - seitz approach to obtain @xmath9 .",
    "in all calculations we used the experimental lattice constants @xmath35  , 5.668  , and 5.410   for znte , znse , and zns , respectively .",
    "@xcite for zno we used a lattice constant @xmath36   which gives the same unit cell volume as the experimental value .",
    "( bulk zno has @xmath37   and @xmath38   in the wurtzite structure . )",
    "@xcite    the super - cell calculations were performed using the full - potential local - orbital ( fplo ) band structure scheme .",
    "@xcite in the fplo method ( version fplo5 ) a minimum basis approach with optimized local orbitals is employed , which allows for accurate and efficient total energy calculations . for the present calculations we used the following basis set : zn , co , mn : @xmath39:@xmath40 , o : @xmath41;@xmath13 , s : @xmath42 , se : @xmath40 , and te : @xmath43",
    "the site - centered potentials and densities were expanded in spherical harmonic contributions up to @xmath44 .",
    "the exchange and correlation potential was treated in two different ways .",
    "first , the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) was used in the parametrization of perdew and wang .",
    "@xcite however , as will be shown below in more detail , this approximation has severe deficiencies in the present case .",
    "the energetical positions of the co(mn ) @xmath13 states with respect to the valence band are incorrectly given in the lsda calculation .",
    "they are expected to be much lower in energy and this correlation effect was taken into account by using the fplo implementation of the lsda+@xmath3 method in the atomic limit scheme .",
    "@xcite the convergence of the total energies with respect to the @xmath45-space integrations were checked for each of the super - cells independently .",
    "the calculations for each cell were first performed within the lsda approximation using basis optimization .",
    "the lsda+@xmath3 calculations were then made starting from the lsda optimized basis but with no basis optimization in the self - consistency cycle in order to obtain convergence .",
    "the slater parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 for mn and co in the lsda+@xmath3 calculations were chosen close to atomic values , namely @xmath48 ev and @xmath49 ev ( corresponding to the hund exchange coupling @xmath50 ev ) for mn , and @xmath51 ev and @xmath52 ev ( @xmath53 ev ) for co. the slater parameter @xmath54 , however , is much more screened and its influence has been investigated more in detail ( see below ) .     for zna :",
    "mn ( from above to below : a=0 ( blue ) , s ( red ) , se ( green ) , and te ( yellow ) as a function of the coulomb correlation @xmath3 in the 3@xmath4 shell . ]     in the 3@xmath4 shell of mn - impurities in ii - vi - sc as function of charge transfer @xmath55 .",
    "the values for cdte , cds , and zno are taken from ref .",
    "( constrained dft - calculations , blue diamonds ) and the other values ( red squares ) by linear interpolation corresponding to the calculated charge transfer.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    ".[table1a]comparison of calculated and experimental values for the nearest neighbor exchange couplings @xmath0 for zna : mn . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     being close in spirit to ref .",
    ", our results deviate nevertheless quite considerably in the numerical values for @xmath56 which were assumed there .",
    "we found a much smaller coupling and we believe that the discrepancy with the published photoemission ( pe ) values ( which are about two times larger than our results ) results from the non - justified use of the perturbative larson formula in analyzing the pe data .",
    "as a consequence , our magnitude of the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath57 for zno : mn is much smaller than that estimated in ref .",
    "( between -2.0 and -3.3 ) .",
    "it is highly probable , that the reduced value of @xmath19 will also reduce the proposed ferromagnetic curie temperature in zno : co and zno : mn provided that the doping level is sufficiently high to delocalize the hole states .    the large discrepancies between different experimental and theoretical approaches for @xmath56 in the strong coupling regime point also to the limitations of the oversimplified model hamiltonian ( [ eq41 ] ) in that limit .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath4 hybridization @xmath12 can then no longer be regarded as a perturbation and the approximation of an infinite valence band width will probably lead to wrong conclusions .",
    "it is highly questionable that the strong coupling case can still be analyzed in such a manner ."
