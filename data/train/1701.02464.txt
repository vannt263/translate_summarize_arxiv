    "our current understanding of the milky way has , to a large extent , been informed by stellar data from large scale photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic surveys , such as , 2mass @xcite , sdss @xcite , hipparcos @xcite , gcs , rave @xcite , segue @xcite , apogee @xcite , and gaia - eso @xcite . as a result , we have already come a long way from simple empirical models of the galaxy that fit star counts in a few lines of sight @xcite , to models that aim to be dynamically self - consistent .",
    "some of these models , such as , _ besanon _ , trilegal , and _ galaxia _ @xcite have been constructed to directly satisfy the observational constraints from various large scale photometric , astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of the milky way .",
    "however , to understand the milky way s formation history , and hence to further verify the models , it is important to know the fundamental properties of the stars , including radius and mass . until recently , it has been difficult to reliably determine these properties model - independently for large numbers of distant stars .",
    "fortunately , the space missions corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite , and now also k2 @xcite , provide highly accurate time - series photometry of thousands of stars across the galaxy , from which we can obtain asteroseismic information that is sensitive to , and hence capable of measuring , stellar radius and mass in a largely model independent way .    a promising approach to take advantage of the large ensembles of seismically - inferred stellar properties is to invoke stellar population synthesis - based models of the milky way .",
    "this offers a way to link stellar structure and evolution with galactic structure and evolution by combining isochrones with star - formation history , the initial mass function , and the spatial distribution of stars of the galaxy .",
    "this allows one to predict stellar observables like temperature , photometry , asteroseismic parameters , as well as fundamental stellar properties such as radius and mass .",
    "@xcite used the first seven months of _ kepler _ data of dwarfs and subgiants , to compare the distributions of seismically - inferred radii and masses of about 400 stars with a synthesis - based galactic model using trilegal .",
    "they found that the radius distribution of the synthetic population matched the data , but the mass distribution significantly under - predicted the number of low - mass stars ( @xmath3 ) , and hence over - predicted the number of more massive ( younger ) stars .",
    "using red giants from _ kepler _ , we found the opposite effect when comparing the observed masses with predictions from the galactic model _",
    "we showed that in the _ kepler _ region for a magnitude limited sample , trilegal predicts more blue stars as compared to 2mass , while _ galaxia _ has no such problem .",
    "because blue stars are young and massive , this suggests that trilegal overpredicts the number of young and massive stars .",
    "hence , it is important to compare the observed masses of dwarfs and subgiants with the predictions from _ galaxia_.    besides inaccuracies in the galactic model , there are a number of other factors that could contribute to the mismatch in the mass distributions seen by @xcite .",
    "( i ) inaccuracies in the selection function can lead to a mismatch and need to be checked .",
    "there could be systematics associated with the algorithm used to estimate average seismic parameters .",
    "( ii ) the probability to detect oscillations can differ from one algorithm to another and this can lead to differences in the selection function . since the analysis by @xcite , a new data set of dwarfs and subgiants has been published by @xcite , which used a different algorithm to estimate the seismic parameters .",
    "additionally , it contains more stars and extends to slightly lower gravities .",
    "hence , it is necessary to investigate the mass distributions with the new data set as well .",
    "( iii ) theoretical modelling of the stellar oscillations predict departures from the @xmath2 scaling relation @xcite and the effect of this needs to be taken into account .",
    "( iv ) to estimate mass from average seismic parameters , one has to adopt certain solar reference values .",
    "currently , there is no consensus on the choice of these with systematic differences ranging from 1% to 2% .",
    "hence , one needs to investigate whether the discrepancy between observations and predictions is less or greater than the current diversity in the solar reference values .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the dwarf / subgiant analysis of @xcite and analyze each of the above mentioned factors . in section 2 , we discuss the observational data and the galactic models .",
    "systematics associated with the different data sets and galactic models are discussed here . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the asteroseismic information for different data sets and different galactic models and discuss the role of the selection function .",
    "we also do a quantitative study of the difference between observed and predicted mass distributions . finally , in section 4 we discuss and conclude our findings .",
    "for the 290 stars in common between the chaplin-2014 and chaplin-2011 samples .",
    "( b ) same as panel ( a ) but for @xmath1 .",
    "the dashed line in panel ( b ) shows the ratio of @xmath4 adopted in chaplin-2014 to that adopted in chaplin-2011 .",
    "there is no systematic shift between the two methods .",
    "the standard deviation is of the order of the uncertainties on the estimated values of @xmath1 ( 4% ) and @xmath2 ( 2% ) .",
    "[ fig : c14_c11_nu],scaledwidth=46.0% ]      the observed asteroseismic information is in the form of the average seismic parameters @xmath2 ( average frequency spacing between overtone oscillation modes ) and @xmath1 ( frequency at maximum oscillation power ) that are extracted from time series photometry using a specific algorithm / method .",
    "prior to the launch of _ kepler _ , about 2000 stars with @xmath5 mag were selected as potential asteroseismic dwarf and subgiant targets based on their parameters in the kepler input catalog ( kic ) @xcite .",
    "they were all observed with short cadence for one month each during an initial 10-month seismic survey phase .",
    "four hundred stars showed detectable oscillations after the first seven months and were presented by @xcite ( hereafter denoted as chaplin-11 sample ) .",
    "following the completion of the 10-month survey , an updated dwarf / subgiant sample ( 518 stars ) showing oscillations was presented by @xcite ( here after denoted as chaplin-14 sample ) , where a method different from that of @xcite was used for extracting seismic parameters . in the chaplin-14 sample",
    "467 stars have measured values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 . of these , 290 stars are in common with the previous chaplin-11 sample . in , we compare the @xmath2 and @xmath1 values of chaplin-2014 with those of chaplin-2011 , for stars common to both samples .",
    "it can be seen that there are no systematic shift between the two data sets .",
    "this means there is no method - specific differences in the two data sets . in this paper",
    "we mainly make use of the chaplin-2014 sample , because it has more stars .",
    "the stellar mass and radius can be estimated from the seismic parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and the effective temperature @xmath7 using the following scaling relations : [ equ : scaling_m ] & = & ( ) ^3()^-4()^1.5 + [ equ : scaling_r ] & = & ( ) ( ) ^-2()^0.5 .",
    "these relations are based on the relations @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which in turn are based on the assumption that the structure of any given star is homologous with respect to the sun .",
    "this assumption is not strictly correct and can lead to departures from the scaling relations . to accommodate these departures we have introduced the factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "there is also considerable uncertainty regarding the choice of solar reference values and this leads to uncertainties in @xmath10 and @xmath12 , when we adopt a specific set of canonical solar reference values .",
    "below , we discuss this in detail .",
    ".solar reference values for different methods of computing average seismic parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tb2 ]     scaling relation are applied .",
    "the corrections were computed assuming solar metallicity ( @xmath13 ) for all the observed stars .",
    "[ fig : galaxia_trilegal_fm_sigmam2],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in , we compare the predicted mass distributions with observations , for the three different selection functions , s0 , s1 and s2 . compared to the observed distributions , the predicted distributions are shifted toward lower masses and are slightly broader .",
    "for s0 the shift is minimal , but for s1 and s2 it is significant .",
    "we note that a ( s0 ) is the same as a. to quantify the shift between the mass distributions , we determined the value of @xmath10 that minimizes the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic between the observed and predicted distributions .",
    "the uncertainty on the estimate was computed using bootstrapping .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    "the two selection functions ( s1 and s2 ) that are based on observables like gravity and temperature , give similar values for @xmath10 , but the value is different for s0 .",
    "it is clear that the selection function plays a crucial role and can bias @xmath10 by 2% .",
    "the difference between trilegal and _ galaxia _ is also about 2% .",
    "detailed theoretical modelling of oscillations shows that there are departures from the @xmath2 scaling relation that depend upon metallicity , mass , and age .",
    "as mentioned in , we accommodated these departures using the correction factor @xmath14 .",
    "we computed these corrections using the publicly available code asfgrid .",
    "asfgrid uses the code mesa ( v6950 ) @xcite for stellar evolution and the code gyre @xcite for deriving oscillation frequencies .",
    "the correction factors are computed as a function of metallicity , mass , and age , see @xcite for further details .",
    "applying these corrections makes the observed mass distribution narrower ( blue lines in ) .",
    "this is expected because for the stars that we study , the mean mass of a star increases with temperature and the correction factor decreases with temperature .",
    "the combined effect is that for high - mass stars , the mass decreases , and for low - mass stars , the mass increases .",
    "this leads to narrowing of the overall distribution .",
    "computing corrections requires metallicity , and we adopted the spectroscopic metallicities reported by @xcite . instead of applying the correction to the observed stars",
    ", we can also apply the reciprocal correction to the synthetic stars whose metallicity is known exactly .",
    "doing so had negligible effect on the values quoted in ( see results in square brackets ) .",
    "we have compared the asteroseismic properties of dwarfs and subgiants observed by kepler against predictions of two population synthesis models of the galaxy , trilegal and _ galaxia_. the previous study by @xcite using trilegal found that stellar population synthesis based models overestimated the number of high - mass stars , which we are able to reproduce .",
    "we identified three potential factors that can shift the model mass distributions toward higher masses relative to the observed masses .",
    "first , trilegal most likely overpredicts the number of young massive stars as it fails to match the @xmath15 color distribution of stars in 2mass @xcite .",
    "second , we found that a choice of @xmath4 that is 2% lower than that adopted by @xcite , which is equally valid given the uncertainty in the actual value , can increase the observed masses by about 6% .",
    "finally , we found that if a selection function based on oscillation amplitudes is used , the galactic models can not reproduce the distribution of the observed sample in @xmath16 space .",
    "this might be due to inaccuracies in the model , but could also be due to inaccuracies in the assumed selection function . selecting the synthetic stars to satisfy the distribution in @xmath0 space removed this bias but shifted the model mass distribution to lower masses ( b , c ) .",
    "the bias due to the mismatch of the color distribution can be corrected by using a model such as _ galaxia _ , which does not show such a mismatch .",
    "the bias due to inaccuracies in the selection function based on oscillation amplitudes can be reduced by using a selection function based on @xmath17 and @xmath7 of the observed sample . doing so , we find that the mass distribution of _ galaxia _ is shifted toward lower masses and is also slightly broader compared to the observed distribution .",
    "a similar effect was also seen for the _ kepler _ red giant sample @xcite , so the underlying cause might be the same . applying corrections to the @xmath2 scaling relation predicted by stellar models makes the observed mass distribution narrower than observed but does not change the mean .",
    "the disagreement in the mass distributions reported here , translates to about 2% change in @xmath18 , which is comparable to the current uncertainty in the @xmath1 scaling relation . in future",
    ", we need to verify the scaling relations to better than 2% to put better constraints on the galactic models .    however , _ galaxia",
    "_ failed to match the distribution of observed stars in @xmath17 and @xmath7 space .",
    "this also needs to be investigated in future .",
    "the mismatch at high @xmath7 could be due to inaccuracies in predicting oscillation amplitudes because the detection probability of a star in this region is sensitive to its assumed amplitude .",
    "however , the mismatch at low @xmath6 is most likely due to inaccuracies in the model , because here we expect the detection probability to be close to 1 .",
    "parallaxes , and hence luminosities , from gaia will help resolve this issue because luminosity correlates with gravity .",
