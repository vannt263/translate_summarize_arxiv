    "the majority of the observed heavy nuclei above iron have been produced by neutron induced nucleosynthesis processes such as the slow neutron capture process ( _ s _ process ) in low mass agb stars and massive red giant stars and the rapid neutron capture process ( _ r _ process ) in the supernova shock front @xcite .    in nature , 35 nuclei can be found on the neutron deficient side of the valley of stability ranging from @xmath1se to @xmath2hg , which are shielded against production by neutron capture processes .",

    "the nature of the _ p _ process is still under debate and it is possible that it represents different independent nucleosynthesis scenarios .",
    "the contribution from charged particle induced nuclear reactions are most likely negligible because the high coulomb barrier reduces the associated reaction rates significantly , though the possibility of some contribution to the lightest p - nuclei can not be entirely excluded @xcite . in its current interpretation",
    "the _ p _ process is described as @xmath3 induced photodisintegration of stable nuclei in the shock front of type ii supernovae @xcite or alternatively in the deflagration flame of a type i supernova detonation @xcite .",
    "more recently pre - explosive sites for the @xmath4-process have been suggested in the o - ne burning zone of massive stars .",
    "this feature emerges in one dimensional stellar evolution models @xcite and also in two dimensional simulations of convective oxygen rich burning zones .",

    "the _ p_-process reaction flux will be discussed more quantitatively in terms of our present model predictions .",
    "the description of the entire synthesis process for the _ p _ nuclei requires a comprehensive reaction network involving far more than ten thousand reactions . with very few exceptions the astrophysical reaction rates have been calculated by means of the statistical hauser - feshbach ( hf ) model , which can only be applied for nuclei with high level densities .",

    "the observed discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical hf predictions seem to be largest in the case of @xmath0 capture reactions which has been interpreted as the result of the use of insufficient @xmath0 potential models .",
    "we therefore will give special consideration to the impact of uncertainties in ( @xmath10 ) reactions on @xmath4-process reaction flow and @xmath4-nuclei abundance predictions .",
    "only a few of the required reaction rates have been investigated experimentally .",
    "while in most cases experimental and theoretical rates agree within the uncertainties due to the model parameters @xcite , significant discrepancies have been observed in some interesting cases .",
    "neutron capture measurements for _ p_-process studies are available for part of the @xmath4 nuclei @xcite , whereas methods for the determination of photodisintegration cross sections and reaction rates have been developed only recently either using inverse compton scattered laser photons @xcite or electron bremsstrahlung @xcite .",

    "we , therefore , kept the seed abundances fixed in order to study the sensitivity of the @xmath4 abundances to nuclear reaction rates .",
    "the seed abundance distribution is determined by the @xmath41- and @xmath42-process history of the stellar material at the time of star formation , which is subsequently modified by in - situ nucleosynthesis during the evolution of the star considered .",
    "the latter aspect is particularly important since the ne / o layers receive an abundance contribution in the mass region @xmath4370 - 90 from the weak @xmath41 process , which occurs during the preceding helium and carbon burning phases @xcite .",

    "there has been some speculation that the @xmath44ne(@xmath0,n ) source might be more efficient than previously anticipated @xcite , which would cause a substantial enhancement in the abundances of the _ p_-only nuclei @xmath33mo and @xmath16ru . a significantly enhanced @xmath44ne(@xmath0,n ) reaction rate would , however , result in an enormous overproduction of @xmath41-process nuclei , in sharp conflict with the observed galactic abundance patterns @xcite . also , new measurements of the @xmath44ne(@xmath0,n )",

    "in addition , reaction rates on light nuclei with @xmath478 were included from the work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to account for the impact of light particle capture reactions on the proton , neutron , and alpha budget .",

    "the efficiency of a particular nucleosynthesis process in contributing to the observed solar abundance distribution can be expressed by the overproduction factor @xmath77 , which compares the produced abundance of a given isotope @xmath73 with the observed solar abundance .",

    "coulomb dissociation techniques are typically applied for studies with light radioactive particles , which are produced through beam fragmentation reactions .",
    "such cases are suited for facilities such as the nscl at msu , at riken , and at gsi where heavy neutron deficient radioactive particles can be produced by spallation or heavy ion evaporation reactions at inverse kinematics .",

    "this influence is particularly visible in the range above @xmath1582 . on the other hand we found that the impact of ( @xmath3,p ) and ( @xmath10 ) reactions is limited to specific mass regions .",
