    "the idea of a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) has been a recurring one ever since einstein first proposed it @xcite .",
    "recent motivations for a non - zero @xmath1 include easing the ` age crisis , ' reconciling dynamical measures of the matter density with prejudices for flatness and increasing the power in large scale perturbations @xcite .",
    "but rather than simply introducing another free parameter , it is more interesting to ask whether there are specific observational signals that could confirm or refute the hypothesis of a nonzero @xmath1 .",
    "we propose one such test here , which uses the fact that a @xmath1 term causes the newtonian potential @xmath2 to start evolving at late times , producing a significant amout of cmb anisotropy @xcite . since @xmath1 comes to dominate rather suddenly , this effect is most important at rather modest redshifts .",
    "but if observations of the density field allow us to reconstruct the local potential , then this should be correlated with the microwave sky . measuring this correlation",
    "thus would constrain @xmath1 .    the strongest present observational constraint on @xmath1",
    "is that from gravitational lensing , which results from the fact that if there were a large cosmological constant , then lensing events would be seen more frequently than they are .",
    "the handful of lensing events that have been observed constrain the fraction of the critical density contributed by @xmath1 to be , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this constraint , however , is sensitive to how well the mass distributions of early type galaxies are modeled and relies on the assumption that no lensing events are obscured by dust .",
    "other probes of @xmath1 , such as measurements of the deceleration parameter @xmath4 , give weaker constraints @xcite . whether our test becomes competitive with these remains to be seen , but the types of biases in the various tests are so different that it is worth exploring them all .",
    "in the approximation of instantanous recombination , the microwave anisotropy in a direction @xmath5 on the sky is given by the formula @xmath6_i^f + 2 \\int_i^f d\\tau \\dot{\\phi } ( \\tau , { \\bf n}(\\tau_0-\\tau ) ) .",
    "\\label{eq : esw}\\ ] ] the integral is over the conformal time @xmath7 , @xmath8 being today and @xmath9 being recombination .",
    "the first term represents the perturbations on the surface of last scattering , namely the perturbation to the density of the radiation - baryon fluid ( @xmath10 ) , the doppler term ( @xmath11 ) , and the newtonian potential .",
    "the second term , usually called the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) term , represents the effect of a time varying gravitional potential along the line of sight .",
    "heuristically , it represents the red shifting of photons which must ` climb out ' of a different potential than they ` fell into ' .",
    "this is called the rees - sciama effect @xcite .    in a flat ,",
    "matter dominated universe , with linear growing density perturbations , @xmath2 is constant and there is no rees - sciama effect .",
    "nonlinear gravitational collapse does lead to anisotropies on very small angular scales , but of small amplitude @xcite . in a universe with a signifcant cosmological constant ,",
    "however , @xmath2 becomes time dependent even in linear theory and an appreciable amount of anisotropy can be created at quite modest redshifts .    as @xmath1 increases , it comes to dominate the energy density at earlier and earlier redshifts .",
    "the effect on the evolution of the potential is thus more pronounced , as is the corresponding anisotropy generated at late times . for smaller values of @xmath1",
    "the opposite is true ; the correlated anisotropy is less , but it is more concentrated at very late epochs . as an aside , we should note that the @xmath1 also has an indirect effect on the degree scale anisotropy , because in a flat universe the presence of @xmath1 alters the matter - radiation balance at last scattering .",
    "in contrast , the large scale rees - sciama effect is independent of physics at high redshifts ( e.g. reionization ) .    to quantify this ,",
    "we expand the sky temperature in the usual spherical harmonics @xmath12 where in an isotropic ensemble the @xmath13 obey @xmath14 with @xmath15 the angular power spectrum .",
    "an idea of how much anisotropy is produced from the late time evolution of @xmath2 is obtained by computing the contribution to each @xmath15 by the isw integral prior to some redshift @xmath16 .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 . from this",
    "we see that a significant fraction of the @xmath15 s at low @xmath17 are produced at @xmath0 .",
    "since part of the cmb anisotropy is associated with the gravitational potential at low redshift , it must be correlated with the matter distribution in our vicinity .",
    "the gravitational potential is determined from the matter distribution by poisson s equation @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fractional density perturbation in the matter and @xmath20 is the background matter density .",
    "it is convenient to treat this in fourier space , so that for example @xmath21 , and also to refer the density perturbation to the present time @xmath22 . in the matter",
    "dominated epoch , all @xmath23 modes grow at the same rate , and from poisson s equation one infers that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "inserting this in relation ( [ eq : esw ] ) , and expanding the plane wave in spherical bessel functions one finds @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "this equation has a simple interpretation in real space : it says that the r - s contribution to @xmath13 comes from convolving the matter density @xmath28 perturbation in our vicinity with a spatial weighting function @xmath29 .",
    "that is , if we substitute the inverse fourier transform , we find @xmath30 where @xmath31    the integral is straightforwardly performed , with the result that @xmath32 equations ( [ eq : fb ] ) and ( [ eq : fc ] ) tell one how to compute the rees - sciama contribution to each @xmath13 .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath33 are easily read off : as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and as @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath38 is reasonably described by a very simple approximation : for large @xmath17 ( we shall only be interested in @xmath39 ) the second term in the integral is approximately a delta function @xmath40 , and the integral is approximately @xmath41 i.e. , it is proportional to the rate of change of the local gravitational potential .",
    "we have checked that this is a reasonable approximation down to @xmath42 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath43 for a range of values for @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath38 is independent of the power spectrum of primordial density perturbations .",
    "the only assumption needed is that the perturbations are in the pure growing mode .",
    "the observed @xmath13 s will differ from the rees - sciama result , however , because a significant component of the observed anisotropy is produced on the last scattering surface .",
    "the latter acts to obscure the correlation between the observed anisotropy and the local density fluctuations .",
    "what sort of signal - to - noise may we ultimately expect in the cross correlation of the density and anisotropy , given that we are limited by cosmic variance ?",
    "let us begin with the most optimistic assumption , that we have a complete survey of some tracer of the matter distribution , deep enough to see all redshifts where the cosmological constant was significant .",
    "we wish to compare the hypothesis that the @xmath44 s defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fa ] ) _ are _ correlated with the observed @xmath13 s as predicted by the @xmath1 models , with the hypothesis that they are not correlated at all .",
    "the relative likelihood of the two hypotheses can be computed for any given data set ; if the correlations are real , then the expected value of this is @xmath45 ( for a set of independent observables , @xmath46 is the product of the individual @xmath46 s ) . defining the signal to noise ratio as ln(@xmath46 )",
    "we infer that @xmath47 this sum converges quickly beyond @xmath48 , yielding @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : f3 ] shows the contribution to this sum as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "note that the rees - sciama contribution is almost uncorrelated with the remainder of the anisotropy , so that @xmath53 .    realistic surveys , however , are not likely to probe the density this deeply . for a survey which is less than ideal",
    ", we can get some feel for the loss in signal by considering the case where the convolution function , @xmath38 , is the ideal one out to some cutoff red shift , @xmath16 , and zero beyond .",
    "the signal to noise ratio in the correlation for a given multipole is then @xmath54 the suppression factor is given by @xmath55 where , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we have performed these integrals numerically and find that the result is very weakly dependent on @xmath17 . the resulting suppression factor for @xmath58 as a function of the redshift",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : f4 ] . as can be seen",
    ", there is a substantial signal even when the survey is cut off at rather modest @xmath16 .",
    "to predict the @xmath44 , one requires a measure of the density contrast @xmath59 in our vicinity .",
    "traditionally , it is assumed that this is at least roughly proportional to the fluctuation in the number density @xmath60 of galaxies ( or other tracers ) : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a ` bias ' factor which could depend on redshift .",
    "the dimensionless cross correlation between the r - s anisotropy level predicted from a survey of mass tracers and the detected cmb anisotropy , i.e. @xmath63 , is independent of @xmath62 if @xmath62 is constant , but it does depend on the variation of @xmath62 with redshift . however , the net effect is to alter the effective window function @xmath64 , and we have seen that the cross correlation is fairly insensitive to this .",
    "a real data analysis could set limits on the variation of @xmath65 and on @xmath1 , and might be used to determine the magnitude of @xmath62 , should a correlation be found .",
    "it would be very interesting to cross correlate the rosat all - sky x - ray survey with the cobe anisotropy measurement .",
    "the x - rays with energies of order a kev appear to be consistent with a simple model in which they are all produced by active galactic nuclei ( seyfert galaxies and quasars ) .",
    "surveys of five deep fields to find these agns indicate that their distribution in redshift ( i.e. @xmath66 ) is approximately flat for @xmath67 and cuts off rapidly thereafter @xcite , so they do indeed sample the redshift range of interest .",
    "to estimate the expected correlation , however , we need to translate this into an effective weighting function @xmath38 .    at any frequency",
    ", the intensity of the x - ray sky in a given direction is @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the mean flux from a source at redshift @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the number of sources in the redshift interval @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "( here @xmath73 . )",
    "we can express @xmath74 as , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mean value of @xmath74 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the matter growth factor normalized to unity today . comparing this with equation ( 4 )",
    ", we can identify @xmath79 thus giving us an expression for the actual experimental weighting function . using a simple fit to the @xmath66 given in @xcite , and the naive assumptions that @xmath65 and @xmath80 are constant",
    ", we find a suppression factor of @xmath81 for an @xmath82 universe .",
    "barring other sources of noise , a substantial signal should be visible in the cobe - rosat correlation , at least for this model .",
    "very recently the large angular scale fluctuations in the rosat survey have been studied , with the finding that there is a significant autocorrelation on scales @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "( it is argued that this could be accounted for if @xmath84 % of the x - ray background fluctuations were due to a new class of x - ray sources in abell clusters ) .",
    "unfortunately , the effect we are discussing would be most visible on scales larger than this ; but even if the autocorrelation of the rosat survey is statistically insignificant on these scales , it is possible that the cross - correlation with cobe is still significant ( just as was the case for the firs experiment @xcite ) .    in closing",
    ", we wish to emphasize that a correlation between the local density perturbations and the cmb anisotropy should exist in most cosmological models to some degree .",
    "the time independence of the newtonian potential in the flat matter dominated universe is very much a special case .",
    "in particular we expect a similar effect in spatially open universes and in models with cosmic defects .",
    "we thank jim peebles for suggesting the use of rosat for this test , and ue - li pen and ed turner for helpful discussions .",
