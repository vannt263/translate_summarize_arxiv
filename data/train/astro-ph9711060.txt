    "the origin and the nature of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhe crs ) , with energies @xmath1eev ( @xmath2ev ) , are still unknown despite several generations of experiments , most notably the haverah park  @xcite , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa )  @xcite , and the fly s eye  @xcite experiments .",
    "data from this latter seem to indicate that the uhe cr component is mainly composed of protons@xcite . at these energies",
    ", protons can not be confined within the galactic magnetic field .",
    "thus , the isotropy of the arrival directions of most of the observed uhe crs  @xcite , or at least the absence of a significant correlation with the galactic plane  @xcite , suggests that uhe crs are extra - galactic in origin .",
    "however , such protons would leave a distinct signature in the energy spectrum , the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin high energy cut - off  @xcite ( hereafter gzk cut - off ) around @xmath3eev , due to pion production on the cosmic microwave background by nucleons with @xmath4eev . there is no strong experimental evidence for this cut - off and the detection of particles with energies as high as @xmath5eev",
    "can not be easily explained in this frame .",
    "no compeling astrophysical candidate for the source of the highest energy events could be found within @xmath6mpc @xcite , although photopion production limits the range of nucleons with @xmath7eev to about 30 mpc .",
    "heavy nuclei would be disintegrated over similar or slightly larger distances  @xcite , and similar problems arise for the less likely option of a @xmath8ray @xcite , for which the effective attenuation length in electromagnetic cascades lies between 1 and 20 mpc , depending on the poorly known strength of the universal radio background .",
    "finally , neutrino primaries in general imply too large a flux because of their small interaction probability in the atmosphere @xcite .    as to the theoretical models of the origin of uhe crs ,",
    "the most conventional scenario involves first - order fermi acceleration of protons in powerful astrophysical shocks , for instance in the hot spots of radio - galaxies @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was suggested that protons could be accelerated up to @xmath9ev in fireball models of cosmological @xmath10ray bursts @xcite . in order to reconcile the observed rates of uhe crs and cosmological @xmath10ray bursts within @xmath11mpc , however , the arrival time of uhe crs would have to be spread over @xmath12yrs , for instance through deflection in large - scale magnetic fields  @xcite . as another class of models , topological defects , possible relics of early universe phase transitions , could release supermassive `` x '' particles with mass around the grand unification scale , through physical processes such as collapse or annihilation @xcite .",
    "these x particles would subsequently decay to jets of uhe crs , with a likely dominance of @xmath10rays above @xmath13eev , and an energy spectrum significantly harder than in the case of shock acceleration  @xcite .",
    "charged uhe crs , such as protons or electromagnetic cascades initiated by a @xmath10ray primary , are subject to energy - dependent deflection , and hence energy - dependent time delay , in large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath14 and the coherence length @xmath15 of extra - galactic magnetic fields are thoroughly unknown , although they are bound by faraday rotation data to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "different authors have proposed to use uhe crs to probe extra - galactic magnetic fields ; some rely on the magnitude of the time delay and the deflection @xcite , or on some features of the angle - time - energy images of uhe crs @xcite , or even on synchrotron loss signatures in the energy spectrum of electromagnetic cascades @xcite . in a previous paper",
    ", we discussed how information on both the extra - galactic magnetic field and the origin of uhe crs could be left in angle - time - energy images of clusters of proton uhe crs @xcite .",
    "we applied this study to a maximum likelihood analysis of the three pairs of uhe crs @xcite , that were reported by the agasa experiment @xcite . in order to do so",
    ", we devised a monte - carlo code that follows the propagation of uhe protons and calculates a likelihood as a function of the parameters characterizing the origin of these uhe crs and the intervening magnetic fields .",
    "future large scale experiments  @xcite , such as the high resolution fly s eye @xcite , the telescope array @xcite , and most notably the pierre auger project @xcite , should allow to detect clusters of @xmath17 , and possibly more , uhe crs per source , if the clustering suggested by the agasa results  @xcite is real .",
    "the recently proposed satellite observatory concept for an orbital wide - angle collector ( owl )  @xcite might even allow to detect clusters of hundreds of events by watching the earth s atmosphere from space .",
    "in the present paper , we wish to examine how magnetic fields could affect the observations of clusters of uhe crs by future large - scale experiments .",
    "we thus assume that uhe crs are indeed dominantly protons , and that the magnetic fields are strong enough to influence their propagation ( see below ) .",
    "we then simulate the injection , the propagation , and the detection of uhe crs originating from a given source .",
    "finally , we perform a maximum likelihood analysis on these clusters of typically @xmath18 particles , and attempt to reconstruct the physical parameters describing the source and the magnetic fields . we describe the simulations in section  2 , and discuss the reconstruction of the different parameters in section  3 ; we briefly summarize our results in section  4 .",
    "we use natural units , @xmath19 , throughout the paper .",
    "protons of ultra - high energy are subject to the following physical processes : energy loss through pair production and photo - pion production ( the latter for @xmath4eev ) on the cosmic microwave background , and deflection in the extra - galactic magnetic field . in photo - pion production",
    ", a proton may be converted to a neutron , that either turns back into proton through photo - pion production , or decays to a proton on a distance @xmath20mpc for a neutron energy @xmath21 .",
    "pair production is treated as a continuous energy loss @xcite .",
    "we treat photo - pion production as a stochastic energy loss ; it is important to do so , as the stochastic nature of this process imprints significant scatter in arrival time and energy for uhe crs above the gzk cut - off , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we model the extra - galactic magnetic field as a gaussian random field , with zero mean , and a power spectrum given by @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "the cut - off , @xmath25 , characterizes the coherence length of the field .",
    "the field is actually calculated on a grid of inter - cell separation @xmath26 and is tri - linearly interpolated between the lattice points such that @xmath27 effectively .",
    "the amplitude of the field is normalized to the r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath28 , and our model for the extra - galactic magnetic field is thus described by the three parameters @xmath29 , @xmath25 , and @xmath14 .",
    "fiducial values for these parameters are @xmath30 , @xmath31kpc , and @xmath32 g .",
    "this statistical description of the field allows to treat deflection of uhe crs in the most general case , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also note that any relative motion between observer and source with relative velocity @xmath33 would introduce effects only on timescales larger than @xmath34 which is much larger than delay times and experimental lifetimes .",
    "it is , therefore , justified to assume a stationary situation .",
    "the numerical code that we use to follow the propagation of uhe protons in an extra - galactic magnetic field is described in detail in ref.@xcite ; here , we summarize its main features .",
    "protons are injected with a flat energy spectrum , and propagated in a given direction in the extra - galactic magnetic field over a distance @xmath35 , from the source to the detector . due to the stochastic deflection",
    ", care has to be taken in how one states whether different uhe crs , that have followed different paths , actually reached the same detector , or not @xcite . during their propagation , uhe",
    "crs acquire energy - dependent deflection @xmath36 and time delay @xmath37 . with a given sample of nucleons",
    ", one can construct different histograms , in time , angle , and energy , for different values of the differential injection index @xmath8 , and of the fluence @xmath38 .",
    "histograms are then smeared out in energy with @xmath39 , _",
    "i.e. _ a high resolution typical of future large - scale uhe cr experiments ; histograms are also convolved in time with a top - hat of width @xmath40 , in order to simulate emission of particles at the source over a timescale @xmath40 .",
    "once the histogram is obtained for different values of the above parameters , clusters of uhe crs can be obtained by picking at random a time window of length @xmath41yr , which corresponds to the lifetime of the experiment , and dialing poisson statistics over the histogram .",
    "we do so in order to simulate uhe cr clusters of events .",
    "conversely , one can use the above code to perform monte - carlo simulations of uhe cr injection , propagation , and detection , and calculating a likelihood of a given histogram for a given cluster of events , where the histogram , hence the likelihood , is a function of the physical parameters described above .",
    "the likelihood is calculated in the standard way for each observed event cluster , using poisson statistics , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the predicted number of events in cell @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the number of observed events in cell @xmath44 for the cluster under consideration .",
    "each cell is defined by a time coordinate and an energy .",
    "the time - energy histogram is binned to logarithmic energy bins of size 0.05 in the logarithm to base 10 ( as opposed to 0.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite to account for improved energy resolution of future experiments ) , and to @xmath46yr in linear time bins .",
    "the product in eq .",
    "( [ likelihood ] ) extends over all energy bins ( from @xmath47eev to @xmath48eev ) and over all time bins within an observational time window of length @xmath49 ; we took @xmath41yr as a projected lifetime of a next generation experiment such as the pierre auger project .",
    "the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ likelihood ] ) indicate that the likelihood has already been averaged with equal weights over the position of the observational time window on the time delay histogram of the uhe crs , as well as over different realizations of the extra - galactic magnetic field between the source and the observer .",
    "the next step is to attempt to reconstruct the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ likelihood ] ) from the maximum of the likelihood .",
    "future experiments are expected to produce as many as @xmath50 particles with @xmath51eev , if the agasa pairs are real . in the present work , we prefer to remain conservative , and we simulate clusters of @xmath18 particles with @xmath52eev .    in ref.@xcite , we discussed the possible different cases of uhe proton images in time , angle and energy , and how , in each case , qualitative information could be gained on the magnetic field and the origin of uhe crs . here",
    ", we will discuss how each physical parameter can be reconstructed , and in which case .",
    "the physical parameters that govern the uhe crs images are : the time delay @xmath53 , normalized at 100eev , the coherence length @xmath25 , the power spectrum index @xmath29 , the distance @xmath35 , the emission timescale @xmath40 , the differential injection index @xmath8 , and the fluence @xmath38 .",
    "the time delay is given by @xcite : @xmath54 hence , information on @xmath14 is contained in @xmath53 .",
    "both the coherence length and the distance play a double role .",
    "the coherence length not only contributes to the time delay , it also influences the scatter around the mean of the @xmath55 correlation @xcite : if @xmath56 , all uhe crs have experienced the same magnetic field structure during their propagation , hence the scatter is expected to be very small in the absence of pion production ; inversely , if @xmath57 , the scatter is expected to be significant , @xmath58% , even for negligible energy loss .",
    "the distance also enters the time delay , and it also governs the amplitude of pion production , hence the high energy part of the spectrum .",
    "a cluster is seen on the detector as a tri - dimensional image in angle , time and energy . as the monte - carlo likelihood calculation is very time and memory intensive",
    ", we only focus on the time - energy images in the following .",
    "obviously , information is also contained in the angular image itself of the cluster .",
    "for instance , in the limit where @xmath59 , one expects to detect a single image , albeit shifted by a sytematic offset @xmath36 from the true location of the source , where @xmath36 is tied to the time delay through @xmath60 . below the gzk cut - off , its angular size @xmath61 .",
    "note that , provided the cluster is seen at different energies , and @xmath36 is greater than the angular resolution , the zero - point for @xmath36 can be reconstructed , as @xmath62 . in the opposite limit , @xmath63",
    ", one expects the image to be centered on the source , with an r.m.s .",
    "angular size @xmath36 . in the intermediate limit",
    ", one expects to detect several images .",
    "moreover , if @xmath36 can be measured , it provides an estimate of the combination @xmath64 .",
    "main features of the time - energy images of clusters of uhe protons are described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "we summarize these results briefly , as they are important to the following .",
    "if both @xmath65 , and @xmath53 is small compared to @xmath49 , arrival time and energy are correlated according to @xmath66 ; see fig .",
    "[ f1a ] . a source , such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 , can be seen only in a limited range of energies , at a given time , as discussed in ref.@xcite , as shown in fig .  [ f1b],[f1c ] . below the gzk cut - off , the width of this stripe , in the time - energy plane and within the observational window of length @xmath49",
    ", is then tied to the ratio @xmath69 , as discussed above . at the other extreme , a source emitting continuously at all energies of interest here , _",
    "i.e. _ with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , yields a time - energy image in which the distribution of arrival time _ vs. _ energy is uniform , _ i.e. _ events of any energy can be recorded at any time , as shown in fig .",
    "finally , for a source , such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , together with @xmath71 , there exists an energy @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 . in this case , protons with an energy lower than @xmath74 are not detected , as they could not have reached us within @xmath49 , even if they were among the first emitted .",
    "however , protons with an energy higher than @xmath74 are detected as for a continuously emitting source , _ i.e. _ with a uniform distribution of arrival times _ vs. _ energy , see fig .",
    "[ f1e ] .",
    "typical simulated clusters corresponding to these five main situations are shown in figs .",
    "[ f1a]-[f1e ] .",
    "the fluence @xmath38 was normalized in each case so that @xmath76 events are expected within 5 years .",
    "in this section , we discuss , in turn , how each parameter can be obtained from a likelihood study of uhe cr clusters . certain marginalizations of eq .",
    "( [ likelihood ] ) are used whenever the focus is only on one or a part of the parameters .",
    "the other parameters are then averaged or integrated over , applying weight functions ( _ i.e. _ , bayesian priors ) that represent the prior knowledge on their values .",
    "as we have currently no information on the fluence , the emission timescale @xmath40 and the time delay @xmath37 , the prior chosen would be uniform in the logarithm of these parameters .",
    "however , we note that the time delay @xmath37 is bounded from above by the faraday rotation data bound on @xmath77 as combined with eq .",
    "( [ t_delay ] ) .",
    "moreover , information contained in the angular image should also be included in the prior on @xmath37 , as @xmath60 .",
    "the marginalization over the injection spectral index @xmath8 is achieved through averaging with equal weights .",
    "although we focus on only one source , future large - scale experiments are expected to detect a large number of individual sources .",
    "obviously , this would considerably increase the sensitivity to the physical parameters .      here",
    "we assume that the source is a burst , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78yr ; we will discuss the case where @xmath79yr in the section concerning @xmath40 .",
    "if the time delay is small compared to the length of the observational window , the time - energy correlation is scanned through , and , as fig .",
    "[ f1a ] reveals , as simple fit of @xmath66 would allow to determine the zero - point of emission , hence the time delay .",
    "this constitutes a measurement of the combination @xmath80 .",
    "our likelihood simulations confirm that , for the cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ f1a ] for instance , @xmath37 is obtained within a factor 2 .",
    "the source is found to be a burst with a high level of confidence .",
    "when the time delay gets significantly larger than @xmath49 , its actual value can not be reconstructed from the maximum of the likelihood .",
    "this case corresponds to the clusters shown in figs .",
    "[ f1b ] and  [ f1c ] . indeed , the likelihood is degenerate in the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath53 , as it depends mainly on the rate of detection @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the scatter in time around the mean of the @xmath83 correlation .",
    "as long as @xmath38 is unknown , only a lower limit to @xmath53 , typically @xmath84 , can be placed .",
    "the likelihood , as calculated for the cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ f1b ] , and marginalized over all parameters except @xmath53 and @xmath8 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] in order to illustrate this point .",
    "the distance and the coherence length can not be readily obtained in this case , as we will discuss further below .",
    "although only a lower limit could be placed on the time delay , we note that , when combined with the faraday rotation bound , this would still allow to bracket the strength of the extra - galactic magnetic field , within less than a few orders of magnitude .    at this point , the information contained in the angular image of the source becomes important .",
    "if the angular image is not resolved , this translates into an upper limit on @xmath85 , which may supersede the faraday rotation bound , see eq .",
    "( [ t_delay ] ) , and eq .  ( [ ang ] ) below . at the other extreme , for a sufficiently large time delay",
    ", @xmath36 should in principle be measurable , as @xmath86    obviously , resolving the angular image would change the prior for @xmath35 and @xmath53 ; it would sharpen the maximum likelihood reconstruction , notably with respect to the various scenarios discussed in section  2 .",
    "we have not included this angular effect in a systematic way ; a quantitative treatment of the angular images will be the subject of a future study .",
    "we note that the angular resolutions of future uhe cr experiments are fractions of a degree , hence the information contained in the angular image becomes significant for @xmath87yr .",
    "as mentioned above , the distance enters the likelihood mainly through the amplitude of pion production .",
    "as long as the high energy tail of the spectrum , _ i.e. _ @xmath51eev , can be observed , the distance is thus obtained with a reasonably good accuracy from the likelihood , as marginalized over @xmath40 , @xmath53 , @xmath38 , and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , the likelihood is sensitive to the distance if the source has a large emission timescale , @xmath88 .",
    "the standard error is then roughly a factor @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the cluster of fig .",
    "[ f1d ] shows a factor @xmath90 difference in the marginalized likelihood for @xmath91mpc ( the true value ) and @xmath92mpc ; such a factor is a typical value .",
    "the difference between @xmath91mpc and @xmath93mpc is typically a factor @xmath94 .",
    "if @xmath95 , and the range of energies seen by the detector is above the gzk cut - off , the distance can still be evaluated , albeit with a somewhat larger error .",
    "typical differences in the likelihood between 50 and @xmath92mpc and 50 and @xmath93mpc are factors @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .    in the intermediate case where @xmath53 and @xmath40 are comparable ,",
    "so that @xmath75 for an @xmath74 in the observable energy range , the sensitivity to @xmath35 is the better the lower @xmath74 , albeit not very strong .",
    "the difference in the likelihood between @xmath91mpc and @xmath92mpc is typically a factor 3 or less ( _ e.g. _ , for the cluster shown in fig .  [ f1e ] )",
    ". it quickly rises , however , to a factor @xmath98 for clusters of the order of 100 events .",
    "we note that , due to the comparatively limited energy range seen in this case , there is a partial degeneracy between @xmath35 and the injection spectrum parametrized by @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the marginalized likelihood does not change significantly if @xmath35 is decreased and @xmath8 is increased ( _ i.e. _ a softer injection spectrum is assumed ) at the same time .",
    "other cases , _",
    "e.g. _ , as shown in figs .",
    "[ f1b ] and  [ f1c ] , do not allow to reconstruct @xmath35 .",
    "if the emission timescale is larger than the width of the observational window , the likelihood becomes degenerate in the ratio @xmath99 , and only a lower limit to @xmath40 can be obtained , typically @xmath100 . however , if the time delay at some intermediate energy , between say @xmath92eev and @xmath101eev , is sufficiently large , and comparable to the emission timescale , then both the time delay , and the emission timescale , can be measured as long as a lower energy cut - off is visible above which the emission appears continuous .",
    "this case corresponds to the cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ f1e ] . indeed ,",
    "if the time delay is sufficiently large , then @xmath36 can be observationally measured according to eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , the likelihood has some sensitivity to the distance as long as events are observed over a reasonable range of energies .",
    "this sensitivity also depends strongly on the statistics of the uhe cr cluster . since @xmath60",
    ", @xmath37 is obtained , and , as discussed in ref.@xcite , the emission timescale corresponds to the time delay at the cut - off energy @xmath74 , below which no uhe cr are recorded within @xmath49 , as follows from the definition of this lower cut - off energy , @xmath75 .    in reality , however , the image observed in such a situation will appear as a burst with a large time delay most of the time : for @xmath102 , the image is similar to that of a burst with a large time delay , as @xmath103 , _",
    "i.e. _ only a limited range in energies is detected . because @xmath104 , most sources are seen at @xmath102 rather than at @xmath105 , where the image is similar to that of a continuous source .",
    "notably , the likelihood for a bursting source with @xmath106 does not exclude the above intermediate situation , for a cut - off @xmath74 above the observed stripe in the time - energy image of a bursting source . in the case of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , corresponding to the cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ f1c ] , the stripe is observed between @xmath107eev and @xmath108eev , and the likelihood does not exclude the above intermediate case with @xmath109eev .",
    "needless to say , the best reconstruction of @xmath53 and @xmath40 takes place when the source is observed above @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .",
    "finally , note that if @xmath70 , the continuous source is hardly mistaken for a burst with a large time delay , which would be the closest approximation to the time - energy image of a continuous source .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f5a ] , which represents contours of the likelihood in the @xmath110 plane .",
    "if the likelihood is further marginalized with respect to @xmath40 or @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ f5b ] ) , a burst with a large time delay is ruled out to about 95% confidence level .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the difference is that for a burst with a large time delay , the maximum fluence occurs at some intermediate energy , and the fluence decreases with decreasing energy below . for a continuous source ,",
    "in contrast , the fluence increases with decreasing energy , according to the injection negative power law spectrum .",
    "the injection spectrum index @xmath8 can be measured provided uhe crs are recorded over a bandpass in energy that is sufficiently broad .",
    "more precisely , in the case of a continuous source , _ i.e. _ @xmath70 , @xmath8 can be measured with an absolute accuracy of @xmath111 .",
    "this is based on the likelihood as marginalized over @xmath40 , @xmath53 , and @xmath38 , albeit for a known distance @xmath35 .",
    "for example , for a continuously emitting source at @xmath112mpc with @xmath113 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , fig .",
    "[ f1d ] ) , we obtained a difference in the likelihood for @xmath114 and 2.5 of a factor of about 30 and 2 , respectively , on average .",
    "an example for this situation is given in fig .",
    "[ f5b ] . in the case of a continuous source with a time delay comparable to the emission timescale , _",
    "i.e. _ such as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1e ] , the respective factors are about 2 and 1 , and therefore hardly significant . for a burst with a small time delay such as in fig .",
    "[ f1a ] these factors are about 10 and 1 . a burst with @xmath68 in which case the signal",
    "would be spread over a large range in energy , is even less sensitive to @xmath8 . in general , therefore , it is comparably easy to rule out a hard injection spectrum if the actual @xmath115 , but it is much harder to distinguish between @xmath113 and 2.5 .",
    "our analysis of the sensitivity to @xmath8 was restricted to a fixed distance @xmath35 , mainly because of cpu time limitations of the present serial version of our code .",
    "we expect that in the absence of information on @xmath35 , an additional marginalization over @xmath35 would decrease the sensitivity to @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , we already mentioned at the end of section  3.2 , a degeneracy of the likelihood between @xmath8 and @xmath35 for the intermediate case , where @xmath40 and @xmath116 are comparable .      because of the degeneracy of the likelihood in @xmath99 and/or @xmath81 for large timescales , it is in general not possible to reconstruct @xmath38 .",
    "a possible exception is the case where all the particles are detected , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "we take advantage of this section to detail slightly the marginalization procedure over @xmath38 . in most cases we marginalized over the fluence",
    "analytically , noting that the dependence of the likelihood on @xmath38 can be written as @xmath119 with @xmath120 and where @xmath26 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 depend on all other parameters except @xmath38 .",
    "this just follows from the fact that @xmath43 in eq .",

    "then amounts to computing @xmath128      our simulations confirm the suggestion of ref.@xcite , that the main effect of @xmath25 on the angle - time - energy image comes through the relative size of the scatter around the @xmath129 correlations . for a time - energy image , if the source is continuous , with @xmath70 , the correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath21 is drowned in the uniform emission of particles within the timescale @xmath40 , and @xmath25 plays no role . the coherence length can therefore be estimated only when @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in this case",

    "the qualitative behavior of these contour plots is the following .",
    "the actual value of @xmath25 used in simulating the cluster is @xmath130mpc , so that the likelihood shown in fig .",

    "this demonstrates that for a broad observed energy dispersion , a large coherence length can be ruled out at least when some information on the distance @xmath35 and the deflection angle @xmath36 , and thus on @xmath37 , is available .",
    "in contrast , ruling out a small coherence length for a small observed energy dispersion is much harder , due to the nature of poisson statistics .",
    "as mentioned previously , provided @xmath134yr , @xmath36 can be directly measured .",
    "note that the upper limit on the magnetic field strength , obtained through faraday rotation measurements , implies @xmath135 .",
    "whenever @xmath36 is measurable , the degeneracy of the likelihood , with respect to the width of the signal in energy , thus concerns only the ratio @xmath136 . as we argued above",
    ", the likelihood itself is not sensitive to the distance if the mean energy of the signal lies below the gzk cut - off .",
    "if the mean energy lies above the gzk cut - off , then not only @xmath36 should not be measurable , but the width itself of the signal now arises from two very different effects : one due to the different trajectories followed by different uhe crs through the magnetic field , another due to the pion production stochastic broadening of the signal ; these effects can not be easily disentangled .",
    "hence , the only way this degeneracy between @xmath35 and @xmath25 could be broken is through the observation of an astrophysical counterpart to the source , or the source host , and the direct measurement of its distance .",
    "finally , the likelihood was found extremely insensitive to the index @xmath29 of the power spectrum of magnetic inhomogeneities .",
    "we have presented a monte - carlo likelihood analysis of the potential of future large - scale uhe cr experiments to reconstruct the physical parameters of the source and of intervening magnetic fields , when the strength of the latter is sufficient ( @xmath137 g ) to affect the propagation of uhe crs .",
    "we discussed five generic situations of the time - energy images of uhe crs , which we classify according to the values of the time delay @xmath37 induced by the magnetic field , the emission timescale of the source @xmath40 , as compared to the lifetime of the experiment . for each case , we simulated clusters of uhe crs using the instrumental characteristics typical of future experiments such as the telescope array , the high resolution fly s eye , and most notably , the pierre auger project . to this end",
    "we have simulated the emission , the propagation in an extra - galactic magnetic field , and the detection of clusters of uhe crs .",
    "we then performed a monte - carlo likelihood analysis on these uhe crs , and tried to reconstruct the physical parameters from the maximum of the likelihood .",
    "we simulated clusters of @xmath138 events , as the next generation experiments are expected to detect @xmath139 events per cluster if the clustering recently suggested by the agasa experiment  @xcite is real .    in summary ,",
    "the likelihood presents different degeneracies between different parameters , which complicates the analysis . as an example , the likelihood is degenerate in the ratios @xmath99 , or @xmath81 , where @xmath38 is the total fluence , and @xmath82 is the spread in arrival time : these ratios represent rates of detection .",
    "another example is given by the degeneracy between the distance @xmath35 and the injection energy spectrum index @xmath8 .",
    "yet another is the ratio @xmath132 , that controls the size of the scatter around the mean of the @xmath83 correlation .",
    "therefore , in most general cases , values for the different parameters can not be pinned down , and generally , only domains of validity are found .",
    "we find that the distance to the source is obtained from the pion production signature , above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cut - off , when the emission timescale of the source dominates over the time delay . since the time delay decreases with increasing energy , we find that the lower the energy @xmath74 , defined by @xmath140 , the higher the accuracy on the distance @xmath35 . the error on @xmath35 is , in the best case , typically a factor 2 , for one cluster of @xmath76 events . in this case , where the emission timescale dominates over the time delay at all observable energies , information on the magnetic field is only contained in the angular image , which we did not systematically include into our likelihood analysis due to computational limits .",
    "a more detailed investigation of angular images will be presented separately in a forthcoming study .",
    "qualitatively , the size of the angular image is proportional to @xmath141 , whereas the structure of the image , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of separate images , is controled by the ratio @xmath142 .",
    "finally , the case where the time delay dominates over the emission timescale , with a time delay shorter than the lifetime of the experiment , also allows to estimate the distance with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field can only be obtained from the time - energy image in this latter case because the angular image will not be resolvable .",
    "when the time delay dominates over the emission timescale , and is , at the same time , larger than the lifetime of the experiment , only a lower limit corresponding to this latter timescale , can be placed on the time delay , hence on the strength of the magnetic field . when combined with the faraday rotation upper limit",
    ", this would nonetheless allow to bracket the r.m.s .",
    "magnetic field strength within a few orders of magnitude . here",
    "as well , significant information is contained in the angular image .",
    "the coherence length enters the ratio @xmath132 that controls the scatter around the mean of the @xmath83 correlation in the time - energy image .",
    "it can therefore be estimated from the width of this image , provided the emission timescale is dominated by @xmath37 ( otherwise the correlation would not be seen ) , and some prior information on @xmath35 and @xmath37 is available .    as a concluding remark , we point out that the magnetic field , although it scrambles the images of uhe crs , also brings extra - information .",
    "it not only leaves a signature of its own , it may also , in the case where the time delay becomes comparable to the emission timescale at some intermediate energy , allow an evaluation of the emission timescale of the source itself .",
    "there is therefore very important information hiding in the angle - time - energy images of uhe crs , which could be exploited by future large - scale experiments .",
