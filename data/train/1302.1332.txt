    "chiefly the research efforts directed towards graphene@xcite have dominated the new era of two - dimensional materials .",
    "many exceptional features of atomically thin graphene layers such as massless dirac fermions , strength of the lattice structure , high thermal conductivity and half - integer hall conductance have been revealed so far.@xcite in spite of its unique properties , due to the lack of a band gap and its weak light adsorption , graphene research efforts have focused on graphene composites over the past five years .",
    "studies have demonstrated the existence of several chemically converted graphene structures such as grapheneoxide ( go),@xcite graphane ( ch),@xcite fluorographene ( cf),@xcite and chlorographene ( ccl).@xcite high- quality insulating behavior , thermal stability and extraordinary mechanical strength of fluorographene ( cf ) has inspired intense research on halogenated graphene derivatives .",
    "unusual properties of graphene promising for a variety of novel applications@xcite have also triggered significant interest in one or several atom - thick honeycomb structures of binary compounds .",
    "early experimental studies aiming to synthesize and characterize novel monolayer materials have revealed that graphene - like sheets of bn are also stable.@xcite though bn has the same planar structure as graphene due to the ionic character of b - n bonds , bn crystal is a wide band gap insulator with an energy gap of 4.6 ev.@xcite the perfect lattice matching between graphene and bn layers make it possible to construct nanoscale devices .",
    "@xcite following the synthesis of hexagonal monolayer of zno,@xcite the ii - vi metal - oxide analogue of graphene , it was also predicted that zno nanoribbons have ferromagnetic order in their ground state.@xcite in addition to these , it was reported that common solvents can be used to exfoliate transition metal dichalcogenides and oxides such as mos@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , mote@xmath1 , tase@xmath1 , nbse@xmath1 , nite@xmath1 , bi@xmath1te@xmath2 and nbse@xmath1 to obtain single layers.@xcite most recently , possibility of various combinations of mx@xmath3 type single - layer transition - metal oxides and dichalcogenides , stable even in free - standing form , was also predicted.@xcite    the recent synthesis of silicene,@xcite the silicon analogue of graphene has opened a new avenue to nanoscale material research . though the nanotube@xcite and fullerene@xciteforms of silicon were synthesized earlier , monolayer silicon was presumed not to exist in a freestanding form .",
    "early theoretical works pointed out that silicene is a semimetal with linearly crossing bands and it has a buckled crystal structure that stems from @xmath4 hybridization.@xcite similar to graphene , the hexagonal lattice symmetry of silicene exhibits a pair of inequivalent valleys in the vicinity of the vertices of @xmath5 and @xmath6 symmetry points .",
    "moreover , the experimental realization of the transformation of thin films of wurtzite ( wz ) materials into the graphene - like thin film structure is another evidence for the existence of monolayer structures of si and ge.@xcite recent theoretical studies have revealed several remarkable features of silicene such as a large spin - orbit gap at the dirac point,@xcite experimentally accessible quantum spin hall effect,@xcite transition from a topological insulating phase to a band insulator that can be induced by an electric field@xcite and electrically tunable band gap.@xcite in addition to unique insulator phases such as quantum spin hall , quantum anomalous hall and band insulator phases , the emergence of valley - polarized metal phase was also reported very recently.@xcite it appears that silicene will be a possible graphene replacement not only due to its graphene - like features but also because of its compatibility to existing silicon - based electronic devices .    in this paper , motivated by the very recent experimental realizations of monolayer silicene,@xcite",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we next investigate the adsorption characteristics of eight elements of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 transition metal adatoms : ti , v , cr ,",
    "mn , fe , co , mo and w. though the outermost @xmath19 orbitals of the transition metals are completely filled , because of their partially filled inner @xmath0 orbitals diverse adsorption characteristics for different atoms can be expected . due to relatively small atomic radius of all transition metals and having more electrons that can participate in the chemical bonding , we can expect stronger binding to the silicene lattice . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it appears that while the adsorption of alkalis do not cause any significant change in the silicene lattice , transition metals are more likely to disturb the nearest silicon atoms .",
    "bonding of ti adatom with 4.89 ev to silicene occurs with a significant lattice distortion whereas the adsorption of ti occurs on the hollow site of graphene without disturbing the planar lattice structure . as a consequence of bridge - site adsorption of ti ,",
    "it binds six nearest si atoms strongly by pushing the underlying two si atoms downwards . in order not to exclude possible vacancy formation and adatom - induced fracturing in such ti - adsorbed silicene lattice we also examine the stability of whole structure through molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations .",
    "ab initio md calculations show that the adsorbed ti atom remains bounded and neighboring si - si bonds are not broken after @xmath201 @xmath21 at 300 k. similar to ti , v adatom is adsorbed on bridge site with 4.32 ev adsorption energy .    among",
    "the @xmath16 transition metal adatoms considered here only cr , mn , fe and co similar to alkalis , are adsorbed on the hollow site .",
    "however , differing from alkalis , transition metals have quite strong binding ( 3.20 , 3.48 , 4.79 and 5.61 for cr , mn , fe and co , respectively ) with three uppermost si atoms .",
    "therefore , instead of being adsorbed on top a hollow site like alkalis , transition metals are almost confined in the silicene plane .",
    "energetics of transition metal atoms on the most favorable adsorption sites are also listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "note that not only the electronic occupancy but also the atomic radius of the atom is important in determining the final geometry of the adatom on silicene .",
    "since for @xmath0 orbitals having more than half - occupancy the atomic radii are significantly decreased by increasing the number of electrons , starting from cr all 3@xmath0 transition metals prefer to be relaxed on hollow site . to see how the atomic radius of transition metal affects the adsorption geometry",
    "we also perform calculations for other group 6 elements mo and w. according to the most recent measurement of cordero _ _ et al.__@xcite covalent atomic radii of cr , mn and w are 1.39 , 1.54 and 1.62  , respectively . in this column of the periodic table , while cr is adsorbed on hollow site , bridge site adsorption becomes more preferable for mo and w due to their larger atomic radii .",
    "effect of the atomic radii can also be seen even in the same row elements : adatoms ti and v , that have covalent radius larger than that of cr , are relaxed to the bridge site .",
    "thus we can infer that only the transition metal adatoms having covalent atomic radii larger than @xmath201.50   favor bridge site adsorption .",
    "it appears from fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) that the energy barrier between different adsorption sites is relatively large for transition metal atoms .",
    "the diffusion barrier between the most favorable site and the less favorable one is @xmath200.6 ev . the most likely diffusion path for ti , v , mo and w passes from bridge to hollow sites .",
    "however , diffusion of mn , cr , fe and co atoms from one hollow site to another one may occur via valley sites .",
    "furthermore , the effect of spin - orbit interaction on the optimized adsorbate - silicene geometry is examined for adsorption on ( 6@xmath96@xmath91 ) silicene supercell . compared with the optimized geometries obtained excluding soc",
    ", so - induced change in adatom - silicon bond length is just on the order of 0.001  .",
    "it is also found that the migration path profile and the most favorable adsorption site do not change when soc is included .",
    "therefore , due to negligible effect of spin - orbit interaction on structural properties , in the rest of our study lda calculations will be employed .          in this section",
    "we present spin - polarized electronic band dispersion and density of states ( dos ) for adatoms adsorbed on the most favorable site on the silicene surface . since the alkaline earth and transition metal adsorption significantly disturb the hexagonal lattice symmetry , electronic band dispersion along the high symmetry points ( @xmath7-m - k-@xmath7 ) of perfect silicene may not represent the real electronic properties of the whole structure .",
    "therefore , a density of states plot covering large number of k - points in the bz is more convenient for a reliable description of the electronic structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we present electronic band dispersions of alkali metal adsorbed silicene .",
    "for the sake of comparison , the band structure of the bare silicene is also included .",
    "here it is worth to note that the dirac cone that is located at 2/3 of first bz is shifted from @xmath5 to @xmath7 high symmetry point due to band folding of the ( 6@xmath96@xmath91 ) silicene supercell .",
    "similar shift can be obtained by band folding operations for all ( 3n@xmath93n@xmath91 ) supercells ( @xmath22=1 , 2 , ... ) . as a result of the adsorption of an alkali atom , semimetallic",
    "silicene becomes metallic due to the donation of @xmath200.8 e charge from the alkali atom into the silicene conduction band .",
    "such an attraction of adatom through the hollow site of the silicene surface with a significant charge transfer resembles ionic bonding .",
    "moreover , since the band dispersion of perfect silicene is negligibly disturbed by the alkali adatoms , it seems reasonable to assume that the bonding is of ionic type . here , in accordance to the charge transfer , the fermi level ( e@xmath23 )",
    "is shifted by @xmath200.2 ev .",
    "it is seen that all alkali atom adsorption bands formed by the hybridization of adsorbate-@xmath19 states with the silicene-@xmath24 states appear in the vicinity of 0.4 ev .",
    "additionally , a small gap opening in the @xmath24 bands below the fermi level , which is 6 , 13 and 31 mev for li , na and k , respectively , occur at the crossing point .",
    "while each isolated alkali atom has a net initial magnetic moment of 1 @xmath25 , up - down spin degeneracy is not broken upon 0.8 @xmath26 charge transfer and therefore all the silicene+alkali structures are nonmagnetic metals .",
    "however , as a result of the large charge transfer between the alkali atom and silicene , remarkable dipole moment perpendicular to the silicene surface is induced . calculated value of the dipole moment directed from silicene to the adatom is 0.30 , 0.60 and 0.94 e@xmath27  for li , na and k , respectively .",
    "though the amount of the charge transfered is almost the same for all alkalis , the induced dipole moment is different due to the difference in distance between the adsorbate and the silicene layer . as a consequence of adatom - induced surface charge density redistribution",
    ", the workfunction of the silicene surface is decreased .",
    "therefore , the trend of the increase in the dipole moment follows the decrease in workfunction .",
    "alkaline earth metals are highly reactive elements that tend to form various compounds by loosing two outermost shell electrons",
    ". natural silicate and carbonate forms of alkaline earths are well - known .",
    "as shown in table [ table2 ] , be , mg and ca adsorption yields a gap opening of 0.39 , 0.48 and 0.17 ev , respectively .",
    "it is also seen from the partial density of states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] that the top of the valence band ( vb ) of be adsorbed silicene is due to the hybridization of @xmath19 and @xmath28 orbitals of the nearest silicon atoms and the alkaline earth metals .",
    "however , at top of the vb main contribution comes from mg-@xmath19 , si-@xmath19 and si-@xmath28 hybridization , whereas @xmath28 orbital of mg does not mix with surrounding silicon states .",
    "the bottom of the conduction band ( cb ) of both be and mg is formed by hybridization of @xmath29 states of adsorbates with @xmath29 and @xmath28 states of silicene .",
    "differing from be and mg , adsorption of ca on silicene does not yield appearance of ca states around e@xmath23 . while the states at the vb edge arise mainly from the silicene @xmath28 orbitals , the cb edge is composed of @xmath19 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 orbitals of si .",
    "since atomic @xmath0 states of transition metal atoms have comparable energy values to that of their @xmath19 valence states , the @xmath0 shell of these atoms is partially filled .",
    "the net magnetic moment of isolated transition metals are nonzero and behave like small magnets unless the @xmath0 shell is completely filled .",
    "though the @xmath0 shell electrons are located close to the nucleus like the characteristic core electrons , they can spread out much further like valence electrons .",
    "therefore , transition metals with their partially filled @xmath0 shells are relaxed to different sites on silicene and we can expect diverse electronic properties upon their adsorption .",
    "we depict the spin - polarized electronic density of states of those transition metal adsorbed silicene in fig [ fig7 ] .",
    "ti adsorption on silicene has a quite different characteristics as compared to other transition metals . upon the adsorption of a ti atom that has an initial magnetic moment of 4.0 @xmath25 in its isolated state , on bridge site of silicene",
    "the structure becomes a ferromagnetic metal with 2.0 @xmath25 net magnetic moment per supercell . since we use a quite large supercell such that the adatom - adatom interactions are negligible , describing the adatom levels in terms of orbitals , instead of bands , is more appropriate . as a result of the strong bonding , the silicene lattice",
    "is significantly distorted , ti atom binds to six nearest si atoms and the degeneracies of the ti-@xmath0 states are completely broken .",
    "metallic bands of the structure originates only from the ti-@xmath30(@xmath31 ) orbitals and silicene becomes half metal when ti adatom is adsorbed .    for the case of v adsorption on silicene , the structure becomes semiconductor with 2.7 @xmath25 net magnetic moment per supercell .",
    "it is seen from fig [ fig7 ] that while only v-@xmath32(@xmath31 ) states have a significant contribution to vb maximum , bottom of the cb is derived from si-@xmath24(@xmath33 ) and v-@xmath32(@xmath33 ) .",
    "the contribution of the other eigenstates at the vicinity of e@xmath23 are enhanced just because of the smearing of the dos plot .",
    "cr adsorption also turns the semimetallic silicene into a half metallic material with 4 @xmath25 per supercell .",
    "the up spin ( minority ) bands of the cr adsorbed silicene are semiconducting with a direct band gap of @xmath200.4 ev , whereas the down spin ( majority ) band shows metallic behavior .",
    "the bands in the vicinity of e@xmath23 are mainly derived from the hybridization of cr-@xmath32(@xmath33 ) and cr-@xmath30(@xmath33 ) orbitals and the si-@xmath24(@xmath33 ) states . however , differing from cr , the adsorption of mo and w that occurs on bridge site results in a nonmagnetic ground state .",
    "while mo - adsorbed silicene becomes metallic due to mo-@xmath32 states at e@xmath23 , w - adsorbed silicene is a nonmagnetic semiconductor with bandgap of 0.02 ev .",
    "note that the half - metallic behavior for ti- and cr - decorated silicene can be quite important for potential use in spintronics .",
    "the adsorption of mn atom in close proximity to the hollow site of buckled hexagonal lattice results in semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of 0.24 ev .",
    "the degeneracy of @xmath31 and @xmath33 spin states are broken due to the existence of a net magnetic moment of 3.0 @xmath25 . since mn , fe and co atoms have the smallest atomic size of the considered metal atoms here , they are the most closely bonded one among all hollow site adsorbed atoms .",
    "both the adsorption of fe and co result in metallic ground state , that originates from the @xmath32(@xmath33 ) and @xmath34(@xmath33 ) states at e@xmath23 , with 2 and 1 @xmath25 net magnetic moment , respectively . as a consequence of the small adsorption height , the induced dipole moments are much smaller than those of the alkali adatom adsorbed silicene .    the adsorbate - induced magnetic moments induced in the silicene layer lead to an exchange - splitting especially in @xmath0 eigenstates .",
    "the calculated value of the exchange - splitting is 0.4 , 2.0 , 2.1 , 1.9 , 0.5 and 0.4 ev for ti , v , cr , mn , fe and co , respectively .",
    "however , bridge - site adsorbed mo and w adatoms exhibits no splitting due to their nonmagnetic ground state .    to reveal the correlations between adsorption energy ( e@xmath35 ) , workfunction ( @xmath13 ) and induced dipole moment ( * p * ) we also present @xmath13-e@xmath35 and * p*-@xmath13 plots as shown in fig [ fig8 ] .",
    "note that the adsorption of large transition metals that occurs with large binding energy changes the silicene s workfunction negligibly . especially for @xmath16 transition metals having more than half filled @xmath0-subshell , the larger the adsorption energy the higher the workfunction",
    "however , it appears that even with a small coverage ( 1/72 ) of silicene surface by alkali metals , a significant decrease of the work function can be produced . for alkalis and alkaline earths",
    ", there is almost a linear correlation between e@xmath35 and @xmath13 . because of the ionic nature of the alkali - silicene bonding , the workfunction linearly depends on the atomic size and therefore one can expect a significant decrease ( > 1 ev ) in the workfunction for adsorption of larger alkalis on silicene .",
    "it is also seen that , while multivalent adatoms do not follow a particular trend in dipole moment , for alkali atoms workfunction shift exhibits a linear decrease with increasing dipole moment .     versus the workfunction @xmath13 and ( b ) the workfunction @xmath13 versus dipole moment * p*.,width=321 ]",
    "in this study , we presented a first - principles investigation of the adsorption characteristics of alkali ( li , na and k ) , alkaline earth ( be , mg and ca ) and transition metals ( ti , v , cr , mn , fe , co , mo and w ) on silicene . investigation of the interaction of silicene with metal atoms has a significant importance because of its fundamental relevance to applications in catalysis , batteries and nanoelectronics .",
    "we found that silicene has quite different adsorption characteristics as compared to graphene@xcite because of the diversity of adsorption geometries and its high surface reactivity .",
    "as a consequence of its buckled lattice structure , all the metal atoms bind strongly to silicene . while the binding energy of alkali and alkaline earth metals is 1 - 3 ev , transition metals have larger binding energies of 3 - 7 ev .",
    "our diffusion path analysis shows that compared to graphene migration of metal atoms on a silicene lattice is more difficult and requires to overcome higher energy barriers . on the other hand , diffusion of metal atoms li ,",
    "na , k , mg and ca may occur at moderate temperatures . depending on the adatom type , semimetallic silicene can show metal , half - metal and semiconducting behavior .",
    "it was also noted that as a result of the high surface reactivity the direction of the charge transfer is always from metal adsorbate to silicene .",
    "however , the existence of charge donation and the resulting adatom - induced dipole modify the workfunction of silicene considerably .",
    "especially the linear decrease in @xmath13 for larger alkali adatoms is promising for tunable enhancement of electron and ion emission which is appealing to silicene - based thermionic converters and cathodes .",
    "our findings also suggest that the half - metallic ferromagnetic nature of ti- and cr - decorated silicene have a great potential for silicon - based spintronic device applications .",
    "moreover the existence of a tunable bandgap opening in silicene by alkaline earth metal adatoms is highly desirable for its use in nanoscale optoelectronic device applications .",
    "the extension of our investigation to a detailed study to include the effect of spin - orbit coupling and of the substrate interactions on the adsorption characteristics of silicene is planned for future studies .",
