    "the scaling methods were introduced by pinchuk @xcite and frankel @xcite independently in 1980 s as a technique to study bounded domains in @xmath1 with noncompact automorphism group .",
    "these techniques have been developed further by many authors and have become an important tool to prove the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "pinchuk s scaling sequence was constructed by a sequence of compositions of stretching maps , say @xmath2 , and automorphisms @xmath3 of the given domain @xmath4 . if the automorphism group of @xmath4 is noncompact then , in many cases , there is a sequence @xmath5 which contracts compact subsets successively to some boundary point . on the other hand ,",
    "a sequence of stretching maps is a divergent sequence of shear maps , the composition of @xmath6-affine maps and triangular maps .",
    "the general expectation is that there is a subsequence of the pinchuk scaling sequence @xmath7 convergent to the limit map , say @xmath8 , uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "if this limit were 1 - 1 , then it would be a re - embedding of @xmath4 into @xmath1 . if @xmath4 is a domain in @xmath6 with smooth boundary , then the image of the limit map turns out to be a half plane .",
    "this is the special case of the riemann mapping theorem and therefore it seems natural to hope for the convergence of @xmath9 in all dimensions .    as the first result in the higher dimensions , pinchuk proved that his scaling sequence has a subsequence that converges to a biholomorphism uniformly on compact subsets for the class of bounded strongly pseudoconvex domains in all dimensions @xcite ;",
    "this proves wong - rosay theorem @xcite . and",
    "later , bedford and pinchuk @xcite showed the convergence of the sequence if the domain is bounded with a finite type boundary in the sense of dangelo @xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in proving the convergence is that the expected limit domain @xmath10 is not bounded ; its kobayashi hyperbolicity is not _ a priori _ clear .",
    "pinchuk considers , alternatively , the convergence of the backward scaling sequence @xmath11 .",
    "if the limit domain @xmath10 is well - defined in some sense , then this sequence @xmath11 always has a convergent subsequence by montel s theorem .",
    "now , a question arises naturally : is the limit map of the backward sequence 1 - 1 ? for the class of bounded domains in @xmath0 whose boundaries are of finite type , bedford and pinchuk have given a general affirmative resolution @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite also ) .",
    "if the limit map is surjective , additionally , then it follows that the inverse of the limit map is actually the same as a subsequential limit of the initial pinchuk scaling sequence .",
    "this establishes the pinchuk scaling method .",
    "the frankel scaling sequence follows the same principle but its construction is different .",
    "given a domain @xmath4 , a point @xmath12 and a sequence of automorphisms @xmath13 , it is defined directly by @xmath14^{-1 } ( \\phi_j ( \\mathbf{z } ) - \\phi_j ( p))$ ] .",
    "if @xmath15 converges to some boundary point of @xmath4 , then @xmath16 can not converge to another automorphism .",
    "in fact , @xmath17 . then @xmath18^{-1}$ ] diverges .",
    "so , frankel s scaling method appears to be similar to pinchuk s .",
    "the sequence @xmath19^{-1}\\}$ ] stretches in some sense , whereas the sequence @xmath16 contracts .",
    "now one can naturally pose the question : when does frankel s scaling sequence form a normal family ?",
    "frankel proved that it suffices for @xmath4 to be convex and kobayashi hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is summarized into the following :    in section 2 , we introduce a special continuously - varying coordinate system , pertaining to the target boundary point . using this coordinate system",
    ", we give another proof to the convergence of the pinchuk scaling sequence on a bounded domain in @xmath0 with smooth finite - type boundary .",
    "we feel that our proof is simpler and more straightforward than that of berteloot / cur @xcite .",
    "section 3 concerns the frankel scaling sequence .",
    "the convexity was essential for its convergence to a holomorphic embedding into @xmath1 .",
    "there has been a question whether it converges without convexity . here",
    ", we give a modification of the frankel scaling sequence so that they may converge also on some nonconvex domains , using a sequence @xmath20 of automorphisms of @xmath1 that converges to another .",
    "two examples are given to show several aspects of the ( modified ) frankel scaling sequence .",
    "finally in section 4 , we observe that the limit maps , if they exist , of pinchuk and modified frankel s scaling sequences are equivalent .",
    "notice that this generalizes a theorem of kim / krantz in @xcite for the convex case .    in appendix",
    ", we give a proof of an existence of the coordinate system introduced in section 2 .",
    "recall the definition of the finite type in the sense of dangelo @xcite .",

    "if the given domain is bounded and convex , kim and krantz @xcite proved that pinchuk s scaling sequence converges , that @xmath345 turns out to be a @xmath6-affine biholomorphism , and consequently that the limits of two scalings are @xmath6-affinely equivalent . in this",
