    "one of the most distinctive features of quantum mechanics is the necessary disturbance to the quantum state associated with any measurement that acquires information about the state .",
    "this information gain - disturbance relation places restrictions on what types of measurements are allowed within quantum theory .",
    "weak measurements are a limiting case of a class of measurements with which it is possible to measure the average value of some observable using an ensemble of particles , all prepared in the same initial state , with minimal disturbance to the state of each individual particle .",
    "such measurements have a long history in quantum theory ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    performing a weak measurement",
    "leaves the state of the particle largely undisturbed , and one can consider performing a subsequent measurement , possibly of a different observable .",
    "consider an ensemble of particles prepared in the same state @xmath0 subjected to a weak measurement of observable @xmath1 followed by a projective measurement of observable @xmath2 , and then postselecting only those experiments corresponding to a specific outcome @xmath3 of @xmath2 .",
    "it is within the context of such experiments that aharonov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the _ weak value _",
    ", @xmath4 as the measurement outcome of the observable @xmath1 for the preselected and postselected ensemble .",
    "subsequently , there was considerable debate over the meaning of this weak value , as it is in general a complex number .",
    "an operational interpretation of the weak value as a complex number , whose real and imaginary parts manifest as shifts in the average position and momentum of the post selected measurement devices , was given by jozsa  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the real part of the weak value as the conditional expectation value of the variable @xmath1  @xcite has been used in analysing counterfactual quantum paradoxes  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the weak value has been connected to the shift in momentum of the pointer associated with measurement disturbance  @xcite .",
    "another debated property of the weak value is that it is not constrained by the eigenvalue spectrum of the variable , that is , the weak value can be larger than the largest eigenvalue of the variable  @xcite .",
    "such anomalous weak values have been considered for signal amplification  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of anomalous weak values can be used to provide a proof of contexuality  @xcite , which suggests that interpreting the real part of the weak value as a conditional expectation value needs to be reevaluated .",
    "much of the difficulty in interpreting the weak value may be because it seeks to analyse the measurement outcomes of two noncommuting observables on a given state of a particle , which is known to be problematic in quantum theory due to the lack of an ontology for measurement outcomes associated with observables .",
    "it is worthwhile , then , to consider whether the weak value can arise in a theory that does possess a clear ontology .",
    "recently , it has been shown that similar features to the weak value in quantum theory can arise within a simple statistical model supplemented with a backaction due to measurement  @xcite , suggesting that the weak value is a statistical feature in theories involving measurement disturbance .",
    "the suggestion that weak values can arise in a classical analog is controversial  @xcite , and it has been argued that weak values have no analog in classical statistics  @xcite .    in this paper , we analyse weak values using a theory of classical mechanics ( thereby possessing a clear ontology ) supplemented with a restriction on the observer s knowledge .",
    "this theory is the _ epistemically restricted liouville ( erl ) _ mechanics of ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is known to reproduce many of the features of quantum measurement . in this theory , all particles evolve under classical equations of motion and it is operationally equivalent to gaussian quantum mechanics ; this connection is best seen through the description of gaussian quantum mechanics using nonnegative wigner functions .",
    "notably , the epistemic restriction provides a sensible notion of weak measurement within the erl theory , one that directly reproduces many of the key features of quantum weak measurement .",
    "we emphasise that erl theory adds neither extra stochasticity to classical dynamics nor any additional disturbance mechanism ; rather , all of the features analogous to quantum theory appear naturally within a deterministic theory supplemented only by ignorance on the part of the observer .",
    "within erl theory , as in quantum mechanics , we find that the weak value appears operationally as shifts in the mean position and momentum distributions of the measurement device upon postselection ( as first discussed by josza  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis in the erl theory gives us a direct interpretation of the origin of these shifts , and thus of the weak value .",
    "specifically , the real component of the weak value represents the shift in the position of the measurement device as a result of its interaction with the measured particle , as expected from a measurement .",
    "the imaginary component of the weak value , however , quantifies not the result of any dynamical changes to the measurement device but simply a bias on the distribution of the measurement device as a result of postselection .",
    "that is , we have an operational interpretation of the imaginary part of the weak value as a measure of how much postselection will bias the distribution of the measurement device .",
    "the weak value is not a unique feature of quantum theory , but can arise in other theories that possess a restriction or limitation on the observer s knowledge of the initial state of the particle or the measurement device , which is arguably a very natural physical restriction .",
    "we note that anomalous weak values do not appear in our analysis , as all observables in our model possess an unbounded spectrum .",
    "consistent with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , our model is also noncontextual : the erl mechanics provides an explicit noncontextual ontological model for all procedures described here .",
    "in this section , we introduce the formalism of weak measurements within quantum theory , as well as briefly introduce the weak value .",
    "we first review the standard formalism for von neumann measurements , including strong ( projective ) measurements , and then introduce weak measurements within this model .",
    "we then demonstrate the appearance of the weak value ( both real and imaginary parts ) in the conditional expectation values of the position and momentum of the measurement device after postselection .      here , we review the framework of quantum measurement , wherein an observable is coupled to a measurement device followed by a projective measurement of the measurement device s position . with this framework",

    "@xmath29 after the interaction , the measurement device s position is maximally entangled with the eigenstates of @xmath18 of the particle .",
    "a projective measurement of the position of the device pointer perfectly resolves the eigenvalue of @xmath18 , and collapses the state of the particle into an eigenstate of @xmath18 .",
    "this measurement , then , corresponds to a strong , projective measurement of @xmath18 on the particle .",
    "the weak measurement limit is the opposite limit of this strong measurement , and aims to reduce the disturbance to an arbitrarily small amount at the expense of a correspondingly small information gain . within the measurement model described above ,",
    "we introduce two different ways in which a measurement can be made weak .",
    "first , each particle can be coupled arbitrarily weakly to a measuring device by using a vanishingly small interaction strength .",
    "alternatively , a weak measurement can also be obtained by using an initial state of the measurement device with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which would imply @xmath32 from .",
    "( while these two limits lead to identical measurement statistics within quantum theory , we explore each of them separately , as they will correspond to different processes in the context of the epistemically - restricted theory of classical mechanics explored in the next section . ) in both of these limits , the disturbance caused by measurement , as well as the amount of information gained , are both very small .",
    "if this measurement is repeated on a large number of particles , each prepared in the same initial state @xmath0 , it is possible to measure the average value of an observable @xmath1 of the ensemble of particles with arbitrary accuracy as the number of particles becomes large .       shown on the right . the shift in the mean position of the measurement devices that weakly interacted with the particles on the postselected set ( shaded ) corresponding to outcome @xmath33 has terms proportional to the real and imaginary parts of the weak value .",

    "in this section , we will analyse the weak measurement and postselection procedure described above in the context of a theory with a clear classical ontology : the epistemically restricted liouville ( erl ) theory of ref .  @xcite .",

    ", we will treat the measurement procedure outlined in section [ sec : level2a ] within erl theory .",
    "that is , we will interact the particles and measuring devices using a classical interaction and hamilton s equations of motion .",
    "however , we will require that all initial liouville distributions describing these systems obey the epistemic restriction  .",
    "this restriction will lead us to a concept of weak measurement within erl theory , including a tradeoff between information gain and disturbance much like quantum theory . by following the structure of the quantum derivation in sec .",
    "[ sec : level2a ] , we introduce a general measurement model within erl theory and then investigate the situations under which the disturbance to the particles is minimised .",
    "we model both the particle to be measured and the measurement device as one - dimensional canonical systems , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the position and momentum coordinates of the particle , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 the position and momentum coordinates of the measurement device .",
    "the particle and the measurement device are coupled via the hamiltonian @xmath92 where the observable we are measuring is of the form @xmath93 the distribution of the particle and the measurement device changes according the the classical hamiltonian equations as a result of this interaction , following @xmath94 after the measurement , the position and momentum of the particle are @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the initial momentum and position of the particle being measured respectively and @xmath98 is the initial momentum of the measuring device .",
    "the position and momentum of the measurement device after this interaction are @xmath99 hence the change in the position of the device gives the measurement outcome .",
    "note there is no change in the momentum of each device due to the measurement interaction , which suggests that any change to the mean momentum of the ensemble of devices , must be statistical bias .",
    "for an ideal measurement , we would require the initial position of the device @xmath100 to be known with complete certainty , and this would lead to a perfect correlation between the observable @xmath1 and the position of the measurement device after interaction .",
    "however , due to our epistemic restriction , the uncertainty in the momentum of the device must be infinite in this case , i.e. , the observer has no knowledge of the initial momentum of the measurement device @xmath98 . from eqs .   and , the position and momentum of the particle",
    "are each displaced by an amount proportional to the initial momentum of the device as a result of the interaction .",
    "if the initial momentum @xmath101 of the measurement device is unknown , so is the phase space displacement of the particle . thus we see how , within the erl theory , such a measurement that acquires complete information about an observable @xmath1 of the particle is accompanied by a corresponding unknown disturbance on the state of the particle .",
    "it is in this way that an information gain - disturbance tradeoff appears in the erl theory , despite its classical ontology .",
    "if we removed the epistemic restriction , the state of the particle would still be displaced by an amount proportional to the momentum of the device .",
    "however , the observer could in principle know the initial value of the momentum of the device as well as its position and therefore correct for this change .",
    "in other words , disturbance due to measurement arises in newtonian mechanics , and the epistemic restriction just makes the disturbance unrectifiable .",
    "note that , despite the change in the position and momentum of the particles due to the interaction , the expectation value of the observable @xmath1 has not changed , i.e. , @xmath102 as in quantum theory , measurements in erl theory are repeatable , and the disturbance is associated with uncertainty in canonically conjugate observables .",
    "we now introduce weak measurements in the erl theory , again following by analogy the quantum formalism of sec .  [",
    "sec : level2aa ] . from eqs .   and",
    ", one can again see two methods by which the disturbance due to measurement can be made small : first , by considering small coupling @xmath22 , and second , by requiring the initial momentum of the measurement device @xmath98 to be very close to zero . in the second method , to ensure that the momentum of the measurement device has @xmath103 ( and not just the mean value of the liouville distribution ) , we must require that the variance @xmath104 is very small as well as the mean value @xmath105 .",
    "due to the epistemic restriction , the initial uncertainty in position of the measurement device @xmath106 must then be very large .",

    "we do not see the appearance of any anomalous weak values in our analysis .",
    "this is because in addition to the observables in our model having an unbounded spectrum , our analysis is restricted to gaussian quantum mechanics , which is known to be non - contextual as it allows a non - negative quasiprobability representation ( the wigner function ) .",
    "our interpretation of the real and imaginary parts of the weak value can not be naively extended to states and measurements that allow for the observation of anomalous weak values , as these would imply a proof of contextuality that explicitly rules out the existence of the type of epistemically - restricted classical mechanics we employ .",
    "what our results show is that for states and measurements that are noncontextual , the weak measurement procedure followed by post selection reproduces shifts proportional to the real and imaginary parts of the weak value even in a model based on classical mechanics .",

    "<S> weak measurement of a quantum system followed by postselection based on a subsequent strong measurement gives rise to a quantity called the _ weak value _ : a complex number for which the interpretation has long been debated . </S>",

    "<S> both the real and imaginary components of the weak value appear as phase space displacements in the postselected expectation values of the measurement device s position and momentum distributions , and we recover the same displacements as in the quantum case by studying the corresponding evolution in our theory of classical mechanics with an epistemic restriction . by using this epistemically restricted theory , we gain insight into the appearance of the weak value as a result of the statistical effects of post selection , and this provides us with an operational interpretation of the weak value , both its real and imaginary parts . we find that the imaginary part of the weak value is a measure of how much postselection biases the mean phase space distribution for a given amount of measurement disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> all such biases proportional to the imaginary part of the weak value vanish in the limit where disturbance due to measurement goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also offers intuitive insight into how measurement disturbance can be minimised and the limits of weak measurement . </S>"
