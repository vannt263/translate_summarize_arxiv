    "the longest _ continuously active _ grb detected with batse is grb  971208 ( connaughton et al . 1997 ; giblin et al . 2002 ) which exhibits a single fast - rise exponential - decay profile lasting a couple of thousand seconds .",
    "such a long duration is an interesting feature because it touches upon questions as when the prompt emission ends and the afterglow emission starts , and on the detect - ability of bursts at extreme redshifts . in principle",
    "prolonged ( and fainter ) grb emission is easier to detect with a device that has ( some ) imaging capability because there will not be confusion with variations in the background radiation .",
    "particularly this applies to coded aperture devices because they employ many detector pixels per point source and , thus , are also not susceptible to hot pixels .    the bepposax wide field ( coded aperture ) cameras ( wfcs ; jager et al .",
    "1997 ) are able to pick up transient events that are as short as a few tens of milliseconds ( from sgr  1900 + 14 ) and as long as months to years ( from x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the algorithms that are employed to search for new transient sources differ per time scale , in an attempt to simultaneously optimize processing speed and sensitivity . on time scales between 1",
    "s and 1  min , photon counts from the whole detector are searched for increases in a manner typical for triggering algorithms in non - imaging gamma - ray devices .",
    "the typical on - axis sensitivity is @xmath2  ( 210 kev ) . on time",
    "scales between one bepposax orbit ( 1.7  hr ) and one bepposax pointing ( mostly about 1  d ) , full iterative - removal - of - sources ( iros ; hammersley et al .",
    "1992 ) reconstructions are performed and the resulting images searched for unidentified point sources .",
    "the typical sensivity is @xmath3  .",
    "yet another imaging algorithm is applied for time scales between 1  min and 1  hr . we here report on four transients which were detected in the iros reconstructions of orbital data stretches .",
    "three of these were covered by batse .",
    "thus , we are able to measure the broad - band spectrum of these extreme examples of grbs .",
    "* 961229 . *",
    "this event lasted 540  s in x - rays .",
    "data of the gamma - ray burst monitor on bepposax ( costa et al . 1998 ) do not show a simultaneous increase , with an estimated upper limit to the peak intensity of 5 c  s@xmath4 .",
    "there are no batse data .",
    "the 228 kev peak flux is 0.2 crab units and the peak profile triangular - like .",
    "the interesting feature of this event is that its 3.3 arcmin - radius ( 99%-confidence ) error region contains the double - lobed radio galaxy pks  j0234 - 0049 at 2.9 arcmin from the wfc centroid .",
    "pks  j0234 - 0049 is 89  mjy at 20  cm ( dunlop et al .",
    "1989 ; white et al .",
    "there is no redshift determination .",
    "we estimate a 1.0@xmath5 chance probability for a radio source this bright or brighter to be in the wfc error box .",
    "we suspect this is a grb because it is hard to explain it as an x - ray burst ( atypical time profile ) , stellar flare ( too short ) and short - duration accretion event on a local galactic compact object ( the galactic latitude is -54 ) . nevertheless ,",
    "in absence of @xmath6-ray measurements , we can not completely rule it out as an accretion event .    * 970111b .",
    "* this is the brightest event in our sample .",
    "it occurred 13.9  hr after the famous grb  970111 . in the wfc data it lasted 2550  s , similar to grb  971208",
    "although there is much more structure in the time profile . for part of the 2550  s",
    "there is concurrent batse data during which there is a strong detection lasting 400  s. the 50 - 300 kev fluence is measured to be 10@xmath7  erg  @xmath8 which puts it in the top 10% of the batse sample .",
    "the 210 kev over 50300  kev fluence ratio is 0.2 which is outside the x - ray flash regime ( heise et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "* 981018 . *",
    "this again is a fairly strong detection in both the wfc and batse .",
    "the event lasted 900  s and the x to @xmath6-ray fluence ratio is 0.24 over 160  s of simultaneous data , again outside the x - ray flash regime .",
    "this is the only event in our sample which was found independently in searches of untriggered batse events thus far ( stern et al .",
    "it was also detected in an offline search for grbs in archival 40 - 700 kev grbm data in which it had a duration of @xmath9  s ( guidorzi 2002 ) .",
    "* this is a good wfc and batse detection .",
    "the x to @xmath6-ray fluence ratio is 0.10 over 274  s of simultaneous data .",
    "the x - ray duration is ill - determined , the event being cut on both sides by data gaps ; it is between 800 and 4000  s.",
    "= 0.4 cm      in as far as 2 - 1000  kev @xmath10 spectra could be measured , they tend to have low peak energies but normal high - energy power law indices , compared to canonical grbs . the x - ray to @xmath6-ray fluence ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ figfluenceratio ] ) indicates mildly soft events which , nevertheless , are outside the x - ray flash regime ( cf , heise et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "given that two out of three batse - detected events were not identified yet as such , despite the facts that the onboard trigger algorithm was enabled ( on channels 1 + 2 for 970111b , 3 + 4 for 981018 , 2 + 3 for 990413 ) and a number of offline searches have already been performed ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "2001 ) , there must be many more as yet unidentified grbs in batse data .    if the 961229 event , the only one in our sample _ not _ detected in @xmath6-rays , is indeed associated to the radio galaxy pks  j02340049 , that would be remarkable and warrants follow - up study of the galaxy ."
