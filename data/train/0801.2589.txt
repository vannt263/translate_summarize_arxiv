    "using high time resolution instrumentation , the three - dimensional orbital geometry of the binary system was determined , enabling a new test of general relativity ( gr ; * ? ? ?",
    "most recently , multi - frequency observations were used to compute the dispersion measure structure function @xcite , quantifying the turbulent character of the interstellar medium towards this pulsar .",
    "the high proper motion and proximity of  led to the prediction @xcite that a distance measurement independent of parallax would be available within a decade , when the orbital period derivative ( ) would be determined to high accuracy .",
    "even if the predicted precision of @xmath71% would not be achieved , such a measurement would be significant given the strong dependence of most methods of distance determination on relatively poorly constrained models and the typically large errors on parallax measurements .",
    "even for nearby stars , both the hubble space telescope and the hipparcos satellite give typical distance errors of @xmath8 @xcite and so far only two distances beyond @xmath9pc have been determined at @xmath10 uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this kinematic distance is one of the few model - independent methods that does not rely upon the motion of the earth around the sun .",

    "this limit is , however , based upon the formal errors of , @xmath15 and parallax , which are easily underestimated by standard methodologies , as we shall demonstrate later .",

    "* ) : @xmath16yr@xmath3 .",
    "besides limiting alternative theories of gravity , bounds on @xmath17 can also be used to constrain variations of the astronomical unit ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "current planetary radar experiments @xcite have measured a significant linear increase of @xmath19 m yr@xmath3 , which may imply @xmath20yr@xmath3 , just beyond the sensitivity of the limits listed above .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the equation of state for dense neutron star matter is very poorly constrained .",
    "pulsar mass determinations can probe the range of permissible pulsar masses and thereby limit possible equations of state @xcite .",
    "presently , only the pulsars ngc 6440b , terzan 5i and terzan 5j have predicted masses higher than the typical value of @xmath21@xcite ; however , as discussed in more detail in section [ mass ] , such predictions do not represent objective mass estimates .    the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : section [ obs ] describes the observations , data analysis and general timing solution for",
    ". section [ dist ] describes how the measurement of  leads to a new and highly precise distance . in section [ ganda ] , this measurement is combined with the parallax distance to derive limits on @xmath17 and the solar system acceleration . section [ mass ] presents the newly revised pulsar mass and our conclusions are summarised in section [ conc ] .",
    "observations of  were made over a time span of ten years ( see figure [ fig::res ] ) , using the parkes 64-m radio telescope , two 20 cm receiving systems ( the central beam of the parkes multi - beam receiver @xcite and the h - oh receiver ) and four generations of digital instrumentation ( see table [ tbl::obs ] ) : the fast pulsar timing machine ( fptm ) , the s2 vlbi recorder , and the caltech - parkes - swinburne recorders ( cpsr and cpsr2 ) .",
    "the fptm is an autocorrelation spectrometer , whereas the three other instruments are baseband data recording and processing systems that employ phase - coherent dispersion removal .      for the fptm , s2 , and cpsr backends ,",
    "the uncalibrated polarization data were combined to form the polarimetric invariant interval @xcite and each observation was integrated in time and frequency before pulse arrival times were calculated through standard cross - correlation with an instrument - dependent template profile . for the cpsr2 data ,",
    "the technique described by @xcite was used to calibrate 5 days of intensive  observations made on 2003 july 19 to 21 , 2003 august 29 , and 2005 july 24 .",
    "the calibrated data were integrated to form a polarimetric template profile with an integration length of approximately 40 hours and frequency resolution of 500 khz . this template profile and matrix template matching ( mtm , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used to calibrate the three years of cpsr2 data .",
    "an independent mtm fit was performed on each five - minute integration , producing a unique solution in each frequency channel , as shown in figure 2 of @xcite .",
    "the calibrated data were then integrated in frequency to produce a single full - polarization profile at each epoch .",
    "mtm was then used to derive time - of - arrival ( toa ) estimates from each calibrated , five - minute integration .",
    "the application of mtm during the calibration and timing stages reduced the weighted rms of the cpsr2 post - fit timing residuals by a factor of two .",
    "all the data reduction described above was performed using the psrchive software package @xcite .",
    "most data were recorded at a wavelength of 20 cm ; however , in the final three years , simultaneous observations at 10 and 50 cm were used to measure temporal variations of the interstellar dispersion delay ( corrections for these variations were implemented in a way similar to that of * ? ? ?",
    "a linear trend of these delays was also obtained for the year of fptm data , using data at slightly different frequencies close to @xmath22mhz .",
    "the arrival times were analyzed using the tempo2 pulsar timing software package @xcite and consistency with the earlier program , tempo , was verified .",
    "the timing model ( see table [ model ] ) is based on the relativistic binary model first derived by @xcite , and expanded to contain the geometric orbital terms described by @xcite .",
    "the model is optimised through a standard weighted least - squares fit in which all parameters are allowed to vary , including the unknown time delays between data from different instruments , but excluding the mean value of dispersion measure , which is determined from the simultaneous cpsr2 , 64mhz - wide bands centred at 1341 and 1405mhz .    a major difference between our implementation of solutions for the orbital angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 and previous efforts",
    "@xcite is that they were implemented as part of the standard fitting routine .",
    "this ensures any covariances between these and other parameters ( most importantly the periastron advance and companion mass , see table [ model ] and section [ mass ] ) are properly accounted for , thereby yielding a more reliable measurement error .",
    "the previous works mentioned above derived these effects from an independent mapping of @xmath25 space , leaving the errors of other parameters unaffected .    as can be seen from figure [ fig::res ] ,",
    "there are significant low - frequency structures present in the timing residual data .",
    "since the standard least - squares fitting routine used in tempo2 does not account for the effect of such correlations on parameter estimation , we performed a monte - carlo simulation where data sets with a post - fit power spectrum statistically consistent with that of the  data were used to determine the parameter estimations uncertainties in the presence of realistic low frequency noise .",
    "these errors , as well as the factors by which the original errors were underestimated , are shown in table [ model ] .",
    "as an example , the distribution of derived pulsar masses from the monte - carlo simulation is given in figure [ psrmass ] .",
    "because of the dispersion measure corrections implemented in the final three years of data , one can expect the spectrum of these most precise data points to contain less low - frequency noise than the ten year data set as a whole .",
    "we therefore expect the errors resulting from this analysis to be slightly overestimated . ongoing research into extending the fitting routine with reliable whitening schemes to avoid the spectral leakage and hence improve the reliability of the measured parameters ,",
    "is expected to reduce these errors by factors of around two .",
    "all errors given in this paper are those resulting from the monte - carlo simulations , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the simulations also showed that any biases resulting from the red noise are statistically negligible for the reported parameters .",
    "( a full description of this monte - carlo technique and the whitening schemes mentioned will be detailed in a future publication . )",
    "pulsar timing results are dependent on accurate ephemerides for the solar system bodies .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained using the de405 model @xcite and , for comparison , selected parameters obtained with the earlier de200 model are shown in table [ demodels ] .",
    "the greatly reduced @xmath25 indicates that the newer solar system ephemerides are superior to the earlier de200 , reinforcing similar conclusions of other authors @xcite .",
    "we notice the parallax value changes by more than @xmath26 , and that the different derived values are closely correlated with the ephemeris used .",
    "although the effect is not as dramatic as it appears because of the under - estimation of the tempo2 errors , the fact that the de405 results agree much better with the more accurate kinematic distance ( discussed in the next section ) , strongly suggests that the differences are due to the ephemeris used and confirms that the de405 ephemeris is superior .",
    "finally , we note that the de405 measurement of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is consistent with the gr prediction for this system ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig::pbdot ] , the long - term timing history enables precise measurement of the orbital period derivative , @xmath30 .",
    "this observed value represents a combination of phenomena that are intrinsic to the binary system and dynamical effects that result in both real and apparent accelerations of the binary system along the line of sight @xcite ; i.e. @xmath31 where `` obs '' and `` int '' refer to the observed and intrinsic values ; `` gal '' and `` kin '' are the galactic and kinematic contributions .    intrinsic orbital decay is a result of energy loss typically due to effects such as atmospheric drag and tidal dissipation ; however , in a neutron star  white dwarf binary system like , energy loss is dominated by quadrupolar gravitational wave emission . for this system ,",
    "gr predicts @xcite @xmath32 , two orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value of .",
    "galactic contributions to the observed orbital period derivative include differential rotation and gravitational acceleration @xcite . the differential rotation in the plane of the galaxy is estimated from the galactic longitude of the pulsar and the galactocentric distance and circular velocity of the sun .",
    "acceleration in the galactic gravitational potential varies as a function of height above the galactic plane @xcite , which may be estimated using the parallax distance and the galactic latitude of the pulsar .",
    "combining these terms gives @xmath33 , which is of the same order as the current measurement error .",
    "given the negligible intrinsic contribution , equation [ pbdoteq::basis ] can be simplified and rewritten in terms of the dominant kinematic contribution known as the shklovskii effect @xcite , an apparent acceleration resulting from the non - linear increase in radial distance as the pulsar moves across the plane perpendicular to the line of sight ; quantified by the proper motion , @xmath34 , and distance @xmath35 from the earth : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the vacuum speed of light . using the measured values of @xmath34 , , and , equation [ pbdoteq::shk ]",
    "is used to derive the kinematic distance @xcite : @xmath38 pc .",
    "this distance is consistent with the one derived from parallax ( @xmath39 pc  see also figure [ fig::px ] ) and is , with a relative error of @xmath0 , comparable in precision to the best parallax measurements from vlbi @xcite and better than typical relative errors provided by the hipparcos and hubble space telescopes @xcite .    given the dependence of parallax distances on ephemerides , as described in section [ sse ] , it is interesting to note the robustness of @xmath40 . also , table [ model ] shows that the presence of red noise corrupts the parallax error by a factor of 7.9 , whereas  is only affected by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "these facts clearly indicate the higher reliability of @xmath40 as compared to @xmath41 .",
    "any anomalous orbital period derivative can be constrained by substituting the parallax distance into equation 2 , yielding @xmath42 in which the error is almost exclusively due to the parallax uncertainty . following @xcite ,",
    "this can be translated into a limit on the time derivative of newton s gravitational constant ( given are @xmath5 confidence levels ) : @xmath43    this limit is of the same order as those previously derived from pulsar timing ( see section [ introduction ] ) , but a currently ongoing vlbi campaign on this pulsar is expected to improve significantly on our parallax measurement , and this should improve our limit to close to that put by llr (;",
    "the llr experiment is based on a complex @xmath44body relativistic model of the planets that incorporates over 140 estimated parameters , such as elastic deformation , rotational dissipation and two tidal dissipation parameters .",
    "in contrast , the  timing result is dependent on a different set of models and assumptions , and therefore provides a useful independent confirmation of the llr result .    a recent investigation into the possible causes of a measured variability of the astronomical unit ( @xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has refuted all but two sources of the measured value of @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite state that the measured linear increase in the @xmath18 would be due to either systematic effects or to a time - variation of @xmath46 at the level of @xmath47 , comparable to , but inconsistent with , the llr limit .",
    "the anomalous  measurements of a number of millisecond pulsars have also been used to place limits on the acceleration of the solar system due to any nearby stars or undetected massive planets @xcite .",
    "the  data set limits any anomalous solar system acceleration to @xmath48 in the direction of the pulsar with @xmath49% certainty .",
    "this rules out any jupiter - mass planets at distances less than @xmath50au along the line of sight , corresponding to orbital periods of up to 1270years .",
    "similarly , this analysis excludes any jupiter - mass planets orbiting  between @xmath75 and @xmath50au along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite also compared the sensitivity of this limit to that of optical and infra - red searches for trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and concluded that beyond @xmath51au the acceleration limit becomes more sensitive than the alternative searches . at a distance of @xmath52au from the sun ,",
    "the @xmath5 confidence upper limit on the mass of a possible tno ( in the direction of the pulsar ) is @xmath53 jupiter masses .",
    "the precise vlbi measurement of parallax mentioned above might decrease this to close to one jupiter mass .",
    "a combination of the mass function and a measurement of the shapiro delay range can be used to obtain a measurement of the pulsar mass . using this method ,",
    "@xcite derived a mass for  of @xmath54 whereas @xcite obtained @xmath55 . it should be noted , however , that these values resulted from a model that incorporated geometric parameters first described by @xcite , but covariances between these and other timing parameters ( most importantly the companion mass or shapiro delay range ) were not taken into account . whilst the length of the data sets used by these authors were only a few years",
    ", it can also be expected that some spectral leakage from low - frequency noise was unaccounted in the errors of these previously published values .",
    "as described in section [ obs ] , the monte - carlo simulations and extended fitting routines implemented for the results reported in this paper do include these covariances and spectral leakage ; it can therefore be claimed that the current estimates ( at @xmath56 confidence ) of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for the white dwarf companion and pulsar respectively , reflect the measurement uncertainty more realistically than any previous estimate .",
    "the distribution of @xmath59 that follows from the 5000 monte - carlo realizations is shown in figure [ psrmass ] , together with a gaussian with mean @xmath60 and standard deviation @xmath61 .",
    "this demonstrates the symmetric distribution of the pulsar mass likelihood distribution , induced by the precise determination of the orbital inclination angle .",
    "we also note that the new mass measurement of  is the highest obtained for any pulsar to date .",
    "distinction needs to be made between the objective mass estimate presented in this paper and the subjective mass predictions presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the pulsar mass confidence interval presented in this paper is derived from the measurement uncertainties of all relevant model parameters , including the well - determined orbital inclination angle , @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath24 is unknown in the terzan 5i and j @xcite and psr j1748@xmath622021b @xcite binary systems , and the posterior probability intervals for the pulsar masses presented in these works are based upon the prior assumption of a uniform distribution of @xmath63 .",
    "these fundamental differences must be accounted for in any subsequent hypothesis testing .",
    "consequently ,  is currently the only pulsar to provide reliable constraints on equations of state based on hyperons and bose - einstein condensates as described by @xcite .",
    "simulations with tempo2 indicate that a forthcoming observational campaign with a new generation of backend systems can be expected to increase the significance of this measurement by another factor of about two in the next year .",
    "we have presented results from the highest - precision long - term timing campaign to date . with an overall residual rms of 199ns ,",
    "the 10years of timing data on  have provided a precise measurement of the orbital period derivative , , leading to the first accurate kinematic distance to a millisecond pulsar : @xmath64pc .",
    "application of this method to other pulsars in the future can be expected to improve distance estimates to other binary pulsar systems @xcite .",
    "another analysis based on the  measurement places a limit on the temporal variation of newton s gravitational constant .",
    "we find a bound comparable to the best so far derived from pulsar timing : @xmath65 .",
    "an ongoing vlbi campaign on this pulsar is expected to improve this limit , enabling an independent confirmation of the llr limit .",
    "previous estimates of the mass of  have been revised upwards to @xmath66 , which now makes it one of the few pulsars with such a heavy mass measurement . a new generation of backend instruments , dedicated",
    "observing campaigns , and data prewhitening techniques currently under development should decrease the error in this measurement enough to significantly rule out various equations of state for dense nuclear matter .",
