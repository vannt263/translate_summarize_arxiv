    "the infrared space observatory _ iso _ ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) with its on - board complement of cameras and spectrometers , provided a rare opportunity to study sources at wavelengths not accessible from the ground .",
    "we present photometry and images of the cygnus x-3 field made using isocam ( cesarsky et al .",

    "we report the first spectrum of this source in this wavelength range .",
    "cygnus x-3 is an enigmatic and unusual x - ray binary which was discovered @xmath630 years ago ( giacconi et al .  1967 ) .",
    "observations of it have been made from radio to gamma rays and in every wavelength bands the system exhibits unusual behaviour . in x - rays and infrared , the emission is partially modulated by a 4.8 h period ( mason , crdova & white 1986 ) , and this is believed to be the orbital period of the system .    in 1991 ,",
    "van kerkwijk et al . observed cyg x-3 in the infrared with the cgs4 spectrometer on ukirt and discovered hei and heii together with n emission lines which were modulated at the 4.8 h period ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "1992 ; van kerkwijk et al .",
    "they concluded that the lines originated from the companion star , either a wolf ",
    "rayet of the wn7 class , or an earlier wn46 in an outburst phase .",
    "this was investigated in more detail by fender , hanson & pooley ( 1999 , hereafter fhp99 ) , who took spectra during a variety of activity states and confirmed that the underlying quiescent spectral type is of an earlier wn45 wolf  rayet star .",

    "rayet wind from cyg x-3 is believed to be the main contributor in providing mass and angular momentum loss which increase the orbital period ( @xmath7 s s@xmath3 , kitamoto et al .",
    "this period increase is consistent with a mass - loss rate of @xmath8 @xmath2 yr @xmath3 , where @xmath9 is the total mass in the system ( kitamoto et al.1995 ; matz 1997 ) .",

    "the multi - wavelength predictions of kitamoto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were tested by fhp99 , who find that during an outburst the infrared _ k _ band spectrum becomes dominated by strong twin - peaked emission lines .",
    "these lines show strong _ v_/_r _ variability correlated with the orbital phase . due to the small size of the binary ( @xmath10 separation , 4.8 hour period ) the observed line flux could not arise from a region of this size as the environment would be too hot .",
    "fhp99 conclude that the hei emission lines are emitted from a region which is significantly larger than the binary separation , and that the variability of these lines indicate an asymmetric emission region , possibly from a flattened disc - like wind .",

    "in obtaining @xmath11 from the _ iso _ data we have assumed that the wind is isothermal , at a constant velocity , shows spherical symmetry , stationarity and homogeneity .",
    "we have further assumed that the free - free flux is not seriously contaminated by stars z and d identified on the cyg x-3 finder chart and within the _ iso _ pixel size ( fender & bell burnell 1996 ) nor by synchrotron emission from the tail of the radio - mm spectrum .",
    "the agreement with the wright and barlow model suggests that these assumptions ( with the possible exception of spherical symmetry ) are reasonable .",
    "we have assumed a distance of 10 kpc to the source ; since @xmath11 scales as @xmath13 , to effect a 10-fold reduction in the mass - loss rate , the distance would have to reduced to @xmath14 2 kpc .",
    "the extinction to cyg x-3 is uncertain with @xmath15 .",
    "this corresponds to range of extinction at 6.75 @xmath0 m of 0.26 - 0.43 , and an uncertainty of only 10 per cent in the value of the flux .",
    "we have also assumed that the gaunt factor , @xmath16 , is unity .",
    "in fact it depends on @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the observing frequency , and occurs in the expression for @xmath11 as @xmath19 .",
    "the equation for the gaunt factor given by spitzer ( 1962 ) , and subsequently used by leitherer & robert ( 1991 ) is valid for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the plasma frequency .",
    "this condition is satisfied over the range of parameters we use here , and taking extreme values for the temperature of 10,000 to 350,000 k. spitzer s equation gives values of @xmath16 ranging from 3.4 to effectively zero ( at the lowest temperature and highest @xmath17 ) .",
    "alternatively sutherland ( 1998 ) determines the gaunt factor for the spectral range submillimetre to hard x - ray and for temperatures from 10 to @xmath22 k. we believe that in his table 2 the labelling of the rows and columns has been interchanged , and that figures 2b and 2c have been switched .",
    "sutherland s work then gives gaunt factors that range from 1.5 to 3.2 .",
    "sutherland considers photoionisation ( which may be more appropriate to cyg x-3 ) as well as collisional ionisation and shows that the photoionisation figures for the gaunt factor are typically a factor of 2 lower .",
    "our assumption that the gaunt factor is unity well represents the middle of the range obtained , but it is uncertain by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "nugis , crowther & willis ( 1998 ) model the mass - loss rate in a wind that is clumped , and in which both the ionisation structure and the clumping changes with radial distance .",
    "selecting values for their free parameters that best fit for each star the flattening spectral slope from infrared to radio , they obtain mass - loss rates for clumped winds for 15 wn stars .",
    "there is considerable scatter in their results , but they obtain an average of @xmath24 . in other words , their clumpy wind model on average reduces the value of @xmath11 to @xmath25 of the @xmath26 value .",
    "assuming cygnus x-3 is close to average , then again this modification alone is insufficient to explain the discrepancy .",
    "fhp99 show that the most likely interpretation of their infrared spectra and their observation of an orbital modulation of _ v / r _ involves a non - spherical wind , with a flattened , disc - like enhanced wind , probably in the plane of the binary .",
    "they note that this also reconciles the high infrared emissivity with an optical depth to the x - ray source that remains small ( as long as the system is not viewed edge - on ) . adopting their model of an inclined disc of enhanced wind , the gorenstein ( 1975 )",
    "approximation suggests the maximum x - ray column observed is consistent with a maximum value of @xmath27 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 along the line of sight to the x - ray source .",
    "if the disc - wind has a solid angle of 10 per cent of @xmath28 then , to be consistent with the _ iso _ data and maximum column , a mass - loss rate of @xmath29 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 sterad@xmath3 in the disc - wind is required ; for 25 per cent of @xmath28 it is @xmath30 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 sterad@xmath3 ; and for 50 per cent of @xmath28 it is @xmath31 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 sterad@xmath3 with @xmath32 outside the disc ; i.e. disc density enhancements of 100 , 40 and 20 respectively .",
    "we compare these results with previously reported theoretical and observational work on deviations from spherical symmetry and density enhancements .",
    "the pioneering work of schmid - burgk ( 1982 ) demonstrated that deviations from spherical symmetry did not change the spectral slope but led to over - estimates of the mass loss rate .",
    "however , the maximum correction factor found was only a factor of 2 , for a pancake ( disc ) with a 10 to 1 aspect ratio .",
    "ignace , cassinelli & bjorkman ( 1996 ) investigated density enhancements caused by rotation . for a wn5 wind their model found a density approximately 3 times greater than the global average in an equatorial cone of 10 degrees half - angle ( or pole - to - equator density ratio of about 6 ) .",
    "rotation at only 10 per cent of critical was required .",
    "harries , hillier & howarth ( 1998 ) found that 15 - 20 per cent of wr stars have significant polarization , which they attribute to global wind asymmetries , found only in the fastest rotators .",
    "they also found that these stars have the highest values of @xmath11 .",
    "they postulate that these stars have equator to pole density ratios of 2 or 3 ( with @xmath11 scaling linearly with density ) .",
    "st louis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) propose a sectored wind structure for the wn star wr6 .",
    "they find the wind divides roughly 50:50 into fast and slow wind regions , with the higher continuum fluxes coming from the hotter , higher speed regions .",
    "radio imaging of the wn8 star wr147 ( williams et al . ,",
    "1997 ) report a wind ` shape ' with a 3 to 2 aspect ratio .",
    "there have been suggestions of a disc in the wr6 star wr134 - see vreux et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and references therein .",
    "nota et al .",
    "( 1995 ) report a bipolar outflow in the nebula around the wn8 star wr124 , with an opening angle between 30 and 45 degrees .",
    "the binary nature of cyg x-3 is likely to create deviations from spherical symmetry , as proposed originally by van kerkwijk ( 1993 ) and for wr140 by williams et al .",
    "the disc configuration reported by white & becker ( 1995 ) is disputed by harries et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "if the wr star s rotation is tidally locked to the 4.8 h orbital period , then it will be rotating at close to its critical velocity and an equatorial enhancement of the mass loss rate is likely .",
    "we conclude that deviations of the wind from spherical symmetry need to be taken into consideration .",
    "ignoring such asymmetry tends to overestimate the the mass - loss rate .",
    "however , to be consistent with the visibility of the x - ray source the density contrast required by our result appears to be large , and we are not aware of any work quantifying the overestimate for such large disc density enhancements .",
    "to obtain the total stellar mass - loss rate which drives the orbital changes any other mass - loss rates occurring need to be added to this value of wind mass - loss rate .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of cyg x-3 implies an accretion rate on to the compact object of @xmath34 @xmath5 yr@xmath3 , which is small compared with the mass lost through the wind .",
    "mass will also be lost into the radio jets , but this is an uncertain quantity , and the mass in the jets could be anything between 0.1 to 100 per cent of the in - flowing mass ( fender & pooley 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "these additional masses are in the sense to exacerbate the problem .    in obtaining @xmath11 from @xmath35 several other assumptions",
    "are made : that there is no loss of angular momentum other than the specific orbital angular momentum of the wr star carried away by the wind ; that the rotating bodies are rigid ; that the 4.8-h modulation , whatever it is , is rigidly locked to the orbital period ; that the orbital period is 4.8-h , and not some multiple of that figure ; that the eccentricity is zero ; and that there are no other dynamical effects ( e.g. gravitational radiation ) or torques ( e.g. magnetic ) affecting the value of @xmath35 .    the assumption that the eccentricity is small seems justified - given the amount of circumstellar matter a circular orbit seems likely , and no change in the light curve which could be attributed to precession has been observed . for convenience",
    "we adopt @xmath36 .",
    "it seems likely that 4.8 h is the fundamental period , but until its nature is understood there remains the possibility that the 4.8 h modulation is not rigidly tied to the orbital period and that the @xmath33 observed is not accurately that of the binary system .",
    "additional angular momentum could be lost through the jets , or through magnetic torques , for example , and ignoring such losses would cause @xmath35 to be underestimated .    gravitation radiation results in the orbital size shrinking , so neglect of this effect will cause the @xmath35 due to the mass loss to be underestimated .",
    "the effect is most extreme for the fastest orbital velocities which occur for the most massive components ( assuming the eccentricity is zero ) .",
    "taking a wolf - rayet mass of 10 @xmath2 and a black hole mass of 40 @xmath2 , @xmath37 , or about 10 per cent of the observed @xmath33 .",
    "if the orbital eccentricity were 0.5 , the effect would be approximately 5 times larger , so although gravitational radiation produces an effect with the correct sign , it is not probably large enough to explain the discrepancy .",
    "orbital motion in a viscous medium ( the wind ) will also cause the orbit to shrink .",
    "it is known that tidal effects in early - type stars give rise to gravity waves which are radiatively damped , leading to circularisation of elliptical orbits and the synchronisation of orbital and stellar rotation rates ( kumar & qutaert 1998 ) .",
    "kumar and qutaert show that if the stellar rotation rate is less than the orbital rotation rate ( strictly periastron rate ) , @xmath35 is negative .",
    "if we assume the wolf ",
    "rayet star rotates like its predecessor o star , then its rotational period would be a factor 10 - 20 times longer than the ( current ) orbital period .",
    "tidal forces will presumably have spun it up ; if it is now ( close to ) synchronised then for a @xmath38 star it will have a mean equatorial velocity of @xmath39 km s@xmath3 and , assuming a mass of 10 @xmath2 , be rotating at 95 per cent of its critical velocity .",
    "it seems likely that there have been tidal forces which have tended to contract the orbit and diminish the observed @xmath35 , but in the absence of information about the current rotational period of the wolf ",
    "rayet we are unable to estimate the current magnitude of this effect .",
    "in summary , there are several very probable effects which could cause @xmath35 to be underestimated - namely unrecognised sources of angular momentum loss , tidal effects , and to a lesser extent energy loss through viscous drag and gravitational radiation .",
    "of the two methods of determining the mass loss rate , this seems to have the larger number of uncertainties .",
    "it is clear from the observations in 1997 june ( fig.[ukirt_iso_q+f ] & [ ukirt_iso_f ] ) that the iso data reveal bright flaring at 4.5 and 11.5 @xmath0 m at the same time as enhanced radio and x - ray activity ( while not presented here , the x - ray monitoring data , which reveal an x - ray bright state at this time , are presented in fhp99 ) .",
    "in addition , the spectrum appears to become flatter ( although we caution that the lack of absolute simultaneity of the observations in the different filters adds additional uncertainties to the interpretation of spectral indices ) .",
    "this flattening is in qualitative agreement with the observations of fender et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2000 ) who find that during both rapid ( minutes timescales ) and more gradual ( days ) variability , cyg x-3 generally becomes redder in the infrared as it brightens .    while fender et al .",
    "( 1996 ) interpret the flaring component from cyg x-3 in terms of thermal free - free emission from a hot ( @xmath40 k ) gas , infrared oscillations from grs 1915 + 105 ( fender & pooley 1998 and references therein ) have been interpreted as being synchrotron in origin .",
    "either way , the rapid , large - amplitude , broad - band variability in the infrared fluxes during outburst periods implies the occurrence of extremely violent processes on relatively small physical scales .",
    "while the timescales do not preclude a simple change in the brightness of the thermal ( wind ) emission , the significant spectral flattening appears to rule this out . instead ,",
    "similarly to grs 1915 + 105 , cyg x-3 appears to display an approximately flat - spectrum ( @xmath41 ) component during outbursts .",
    "this may be related to the flat spectral component now also known to be present in cyg x-1 ( fender et al .",
    "the nature of this component is uncertain , but it appears to be related to jet formation , and possibly to instabilities in the accretion flow / disc , at least in grs 1915 + 105 . in summary , while there may be variability in the strength of the underlying thermal ( wind ) component , we believe the additional flux observed in outburst to be dominated by a variable , flat - spectrum component which is probably associated with the jets .",
    "we report the first quiescent and flaring 4 - 16 @xmath0 m observations of cygnus x-3 .",
    "the quiescent spectrum is a continuation of the shorter wavelength ir spectrum , and fits well the wb75 model for thermal free - free emission from a wind .",
    "we obtain a mass loss rate , assuming spherical symmetry of @xmath42 @xmath2 yr@xmath3 , and note that while this is consistent with other determinations , it is an order of magnitude larger than both the mass loss rate required to derive the change in orbital period ( assuming @xmath9 of the order @xmath43 ) , and the mass loss rate expected from the hydrogen column density to the x - ray source .",
    "these measurements are based on assumptions , which have been scrutinised carefully ; while we can identify a number of areas where factors of a few can be gained , we have been unable to identify a single area where a factor of ten can be found .",
    "we agree with the conclusion of fhp99 that the wind is most likely spherically asymmetric , but if this is the only effect operating , large disc density enhancement factors are required .",
    "there are several phenomena which could cause @xmath44 to be underestimated ; we regard this determination of @xmath11 to be less reliable .    during radio and x - ray outburst ,",
    "the broadband infrared spectrum shows rapid variability and a spectral flattening associated with increased flux densities .",
    "this is in agreement with what is seen in the near - ir during rapid ( minutes ) flaring events ( fender et al .",
    "similar ( but not identical ) near - ir events observed from grs 1915 + 105 appear to be associated with jet formation episodes .",
    "the emission mechanism responsible for this flat spectral component remains uncertain ; both free - free and synchrotron emission have been proposed already in the literature , and await detailed studies to test their viability .",
    "whatever the origin of this component , it seems likely that it is associated with hot gas in the jet from the system , which naturally explains its emergence during periods of enhanced radio ( jet ) activity .",
