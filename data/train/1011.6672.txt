    "the ruddlesden - popper ( rp ) compounds [ ] are those of the type a@xmath4b@xmath5 c@xmath6 , where the valences of the ions are a @xmath7 , b @xmath8 , and c @xmath9 ( usually c is oxygen ) . at high temperature the crystal structure for many of these compounds is tetragonal , but the structure can distort in several ways as the temperature passes through structural phase transitions . in the lowest symmetry phase ,",
    "these systems are usually ferroelectric and can also be magnetically ordered , although , in contrast to many magnetoelectrics , [ ] these two degrees of freedom do not appear at the same temperature .",
    "nevertheless the rp systems do have many interesting couplings between their magnetic and dielectric properties .",
    "for example , their spontaneous polarization can be rotated by the application of a magnetic field and the weak ferromagnetic moment can be rotated by the application of an electric field .",
    "[ ] the symmetry of the rp s is very similar to that of the aurivillius compound srbi@xmath1ta@xmath1o@xmath10 analyzed in detail by perez - mato _ et al . _ [ ] and many of our results should also apply to it . although there have been several first principles calculations of the properties of cmo and/or cto , [ ] the calculations of cf are most relevant to the present paper .",

    "the oxygen ions are the blue spheres , the ca ions are the open green circles , and the mn or ti ions ( not shown ) are at the centers of the octahedra of oxygen ions .",
    "there are two molecules per conventional unit cell.,width=5 ]    here we will be interested in the two rp compounds ca@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( cmo ) and ca@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( cto ) , which consist of bilayers of oxygen octahedra enclosing a mn or ti ion .",
    "it is believed that the high - temperature phase is tetragonal ( i4/mmm ) [ ] and the low - temperature phase is orthorhombic ( cmc2@xmath3 ) [ ] and in fig .",
    "[ gsg ] we show the three possible paths that connect these structures .",
    "[ ] first principles calculations [ ] indicate that the most likely scenario involves the appearance , as the temperature is lowered , of the intermediate state cmcm at a temperature we denote @xmath11 . in fact , the cmcm phase has been observed in the isostructural compounds laca@xmath1mn@xmath1o@xmath2 [ ] at and below room temperature and bi@xmath12ca@xmath13mn@xmath1o@xmath2 [ ] at room teperature .",
    "accordingly , we will assume that this scenario applies to cmo and cto although for these systems no intermediate phase has been observed up to now .",
    "however , recent measurements on ceramic cmo find a clear pyroelectric signal consistent with the onset of ferroelectric order close to @xmath14k .",
    "[ ] this transition is identified as the temperature at which cmc2@xmath3 appears .",
    "since this ferroelectric transition seems to be a continuous and well - developed one and since a direct continuous transition between i4/mmm and cmc2@xmath3 is inconsistent with landau theory , [ ] the seemingly inescapable conclusion is that the phase for @xmath15 slightly greater than @xmath11 is _ not _ i4/mmm , but is some phase which does not allow a spontaneous polarization .",
    "thus the phase at temperature just above @xmath11 may be the cmcm phase .",
    "in this scenario the cmc2@xmath3 phase would appear at a lower temperature @xmath16 ( which experimental data implies is quite close to @xmath11 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss the symmetry of the zone center phonons and the raman scattering cross section as they are modified by the successive lowering of symmetry as the temperature is reduced through the structural phase transitions at @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "such a symmetry analysis can be done using standard group theory methods . here",
    "we will supplement that analysis with an analysis of the phonon cross sections from which we determine their power law dependence on the order parameters ( op s ) which characterize the distortions from tetragonal symmetry to the lower symmetry structures .",
    "this enables us to predict the temperature dependence of the newly allowed cross sections which appear at the structural phase transitions .",
    "we then give a similar analysis of the magnon - phonon interaction .",
    "as a result of this coupling , the magnon absorption cross section ( which usually results from a magnetic dipole allowed transition ) is enhanced by now being electric - dipole allowed . this enhancement has led some authors [ ] to call such magnons  electromagnons . \"    briefly , this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ ] ( for the two dimensional irreps one sums these squares over the two states of the irreps . ) for both absorption and scattering we implicitly assume that the photon wave length is very large in comparison to the size of the unit cell .",

    "<S> we determine the power law behavior ( within mean field theory ) for the cross section for photon absorption and raman scattering of modes which appear as the symmetry is successively lowered . in the cmc2@xmath3 phase we give a symmetry analysis to discuss the magnon - phonon coupling which in other systems gives rise to  electromagnons . \" from our results we suggest several experiments to clarify the phase diagram and other properties of these systems . </S>"
