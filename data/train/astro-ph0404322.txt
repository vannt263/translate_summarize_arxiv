    "in contrast with the detailed knowledge we have of the stellar content of the halo of the galaxy , the dark matter content is far less well characterised , with both the total mass and the size of the halo poorly determined quantities . the accurate measurement of the mass profile would provide important clues to the nature of the dark matter .",
    "for instance , an accurate estimate of the mass within a radius of 50 kpc is required to establish the fraction of the mass in compact objects identified from microlensing experiments ( e.g alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) . quantifying",
    "the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy is essential for understanding the assembly of the various baryonic components through comparison with simulations .",
    "this paper is the second in a series of four , presenting a new measurement of the mass profile of the galaxy out to the largest radii , @xmath7kpc , to denote galactocentric distances and the coordinate @xmath8 to denote heliocentric distances ] using surveys for remote halo blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "the main shortcoming of previous analyses of the mass of the galaxy is the small size of the sample of objects at large radii , used as dynamical tracers .",
    "wilkinson and evans ( 1999 , hereafter we99 ) calculate the total mass of the milky way to be @xmath9 , using the full set of 27 known satellite galaxies and globular clusters at galactocentric radii @xmath10 20 kpc ( six of which possess measured proper motions )",
    ". this sample must be nearly complete , so a new population of distant halo objects must be found in order to increase the number of dynamical tracers .",
    "field bhb stars are ideal for this purpose .",
    "these a  type stars are luminous , @xmath11 (  5 ) , which ensures that they can be detected to large distances , and have a small spread in absolute magnitude , so their distances may be determined accurately .    in a recent paper sakamoto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) added new kinematic data to the dataset used by we99 , and obtained a considerably more precise estimate of the total mass of the galaxy of @xmath12 .",
    "primarily , the new kinematic data comprise radial velocities of 412 bhb stars , of which 211 have proper motions , at heliocentric distances @xmath13kpc , with a median distance of @xmath14 4.5kpc .",
    "sakamoto et al . adopted the we99 mass model , where the total mass enclosed within galactocentric radius @xmath15 is @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is the scale length , for which the best - fit value of 225kpc was obtained . for @xmath18kpc , i.e. a radius containing all the bhb stars used in the analysis , this gives @xmath19",
    "this indicates that most of the improved precision derives from kinematic data within a radius containing only one tenth of the total mass , and therefore relies on extrapolation of a model that is tightly constrained only at small radii . in a review of mass estimates of the milky way halo ,",
    "zaritsky ( 1999 ) emphasises the dangers of such extrapolation ( see also bellazzini , 2004 , for a useful discussion ) .",
    "this motivates a new survey for remote bhb stars , at distances that are a substantial fraction of the halo scale length @xmath17 , in order to obtain a direct measure of the enclosed mass at large radii",
    ".    although bhb stars are abundant in the galaxy halo , selection of a clean sample is not straightforward .",
    "samples of field a  type stars in the halo are easily identifiable in ubr ( or equivalent e.g. @xmath20 ) multicolour datasets ( e.g. yanny et al .",
    "samples selected by broadband colour include not only bhb stars but also stars of main sequence surface gravity that are some 2 magnitudes less luminous , predominantly field blue stragglers ( hereafter a / bs ) , as well as a small proportion of quasars .",
    "the reason that no large sample of remote @xmath21kpc bhb stars has yet been compiled , is that the methods developed for separating the two populations of a stars ( e.g. kinman , suntzeff , and kraft , 1994 ) require signal - to - noise ( @xmath22 ) ratios that are unfeasibly high for such faint stars ( @xmath23 ) . in the first paper in this series ( clewley et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter paper i ) , we developed two methods that overcome the difficulties .",
    "the methods require relatively modest telescope resources , yet produce samples with high completeness and low contamination .",
    "the methods are applicable specifically to the classification of halo stars with strong balmer lines , defined by ew @xmath24 , i.e. a stars in the approximate colour range @xmath25 .",
    "both methods employ a sersic function fit to the h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 absorption lines .",
    "the first method , the _",
    "@xmath28colour _ method , plots the average of the width of the two balmer lines against @xmath29 colour . the a / bs stars , having higher surface gravity , separate from the bhb stars because of their broader balmer lines .",
    "the ew of the cak line is used to filter out a small number of interlopers in the bhb sample .",
    "we used monte carlo methods to establish that with @xmath29 colours accurate to @xmath30 magnitudes , and spectra of @xmath31 , samples of bhb stars selected by this method would be about @xmath32 complete , with a contamination of @xmath33 by a / bs stars .",
    "contamination at this level can safely be accounted for in the dynamical analysis .",
    "spectra of this @xmath22 are also suitable for measurement of the radial velocities .",
    "the second method , called the _ scale width  shape _ method , plots two parameters of the sersic fit , the scale width @xmath34 , against the power  law exponent @xmath35 .",
    "the method is almost as efficient as the _",
    "@xmath28colour _ method , with @xmath36 completeness and @xmath37 contamination , for the same spectroscopic @xmath22 of @xmath38 .",
    "again , the ew of the cak line is used to filter out a small number of interlopers . the advantage of the _ scale width  shape _",
    "method is that colours are not needed . for samples of stars with existing accurate @xmath29 colours ,",
    "the first method is preferred , as the contamination is lower , and the completeness higher .",
    "the gain is small , however , and accurate photometry is time consuming . where accurate colours are not already available , if telescope resources are limited , the best practical solution will be simply to obtain spectra , and use the _ scale width ",
    "shape _ method .    in this second paper",
    "we describe the compilation of a sample of bhb stars in the magnitude range @xmath39 , corresponding to heliocentric distances @xmath40 kpc , using the two classification methods described above .",
    "this first survey ( hereafter the ukst survey ) starts from photographic plates taken with the united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) . in the third paper",
    "we describe a second survey , for fainter bhb stars , @xmath41 , corresponding to heliocentric distances @xmath6 kpc .",
    "this second survey starts from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) early data release ( edr ) ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the fourth paper will present the dynamical analysis of these two data sets , combined with the 27 satellites and globular clusters analysed by we99 .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the selection of the ukst fields , the reduction of the plate scans , and the production of the multicolour photometric datasets .",
    "we provide catalogues of a total of 461 objects with the colours of a  type stars , which are candidate halo bhb stars .",
    "section 3 covers ccd @xmath42 photometry of 280 candidate bhb stars , and section 4 describes the spectroscopic observations of 156 candidates .",
    "we describe the measurement of the metallicity and the radial velocity from the spectra .",
    "section 5 reviews the measurement of distances of bhb stars .",
    "in section 6 we use these results and the methods developed in paper i to classify these stars , and we provide a table of distances and radial velocities of the 60 confirmed bhb stars .",
    "finally , in section 7 we provide a summary of the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "in this section we explain how the six ukst fields for the survey were chosen , and we describe the compilation of calibrated three - band photographic photometric datasets in each field .",
    "we detail the ( dereddened ) magnitude and colour criteria for the selection of candidate bhb stars from these datasets , and provide complete lists of the candidates for each field .",
    "these candidate lists are suitable , for example , for quantifying number counts of a  type stars in different directions through the galaxy . on the other hand , the sub - set of objects for which ccd photometry and spectroscopy were obtained",
    "was not selected randomly from the candidate lists .",
    "rather , both magnitude and colour criteria were applied .",
    "for example , for the ccd photometry , if the seeing was poor , brighter objects were selected for observation , while spectroscopy was limited almost exclusively to objects with confirmed ccd colours in the range @xmath43 , since the classification methods work well only within this range . in fact , because the colour selection criteria were not finalised at the outset of the survey , a small number of objects that fall outside the selection criteria used to define the complete candidate samples , were also included in the ccd photometry and spectroscopy campaign .",
    "the consequence of this is that the final list of confirmed bhb stars is not a random sub - set of the complete candidate lists , and so can not be used , for example , for quantifying the density profile of bhb stars in the halo . on the other hand , since the stars have been selected without reference to kinematic information , each confirmed bhb star randomly samples the radial  velocity distribution function at that distance , and so the sample is suitable for dynamical analysis .",
    "we selected the fields to give good coverage in opposing directions above and below the galactic plane , with a wide range of galactic longitudes .",
    "although the kinematic information is limited to radial velocities , because of the offset of the sun from the galactic centre the widely different lines of sight through the galaxy provide some complementary information on the anisotropy of the stellar orbits , and also avoid the risk of the whole sample residing in a halo stream , such as those associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. ibata , gilmore & irwin , 1994 , dohm - palmer et al .",
    "2001 , newberg et al .",
    "the selection of fields was subject to the availability of suitable plate material in the ukst archive .",
    "this restricts the search to negative declinations , and to fields containing pairs of high  grade plates in the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 bands .",
    "we chose six fields at high galactic latitude , @xmath47 , to minimise galactic extinction .",
    "the coordinates of the centres of the six fields are provided in table [ tab_survey ] , and plotted in fig . 1",

    "1984 ) to produce lists of detected objects , and their measured properties , including uncalibrated fluxes .",
    "these lists were then matched and calibrated .    in four fields we used pairs of plates in the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath60 pass - bands .",
    "the exceptions were f358 which had a single @xmath60 plate , and sa94 where we used two @xmath15 plates .",
    "the @xmath15 band is a slightly narrower and redder band than the standard @xmath60 band .",
    "the effective area of the scan in each field , approximately 25 square degrees , is listed in table [ tab_boxinfo ] .",
    "the effective area is the actual area scanned , after allowing for regions drilled out around bright stars , multiplied by a factor 0.8 to account for incompleteness due to plate flaws , satellite trails and merging with neighbouring images .",
    "the survey covers a total effective area of 150.3 square degrees over the six fields .    in pairing and calibrating the object lists from the plates in each field we followed the same reduction steps described in detail by warren at al .",
    "( 1991 ) ",
    "in fact the sgp catalogue described here is the same catalogue used by them to search for quasars . in outline ,",
    "the processing steps are as follows . for each detected object",
    "the apm measures a parameter _ intensity _ that scales monotonically and non  linearly with flux , as well as several parameters describing the light profile and the shape of each source .",
    "the variation of the light profile as a function of intensity , for stellar objects on the plates , is used to calibrate the intensities onto a scale that is approximately linear with flux ( bunclark & irwin , 1983 ) .",
    "the main purpose of using pairs of plates in each band was to reduce the photometric uncertainties by averaging the intensities .",
    "the response curve of the photographic emulsion is not perfectly uniform , but varies across each plate ( known as field effects ) . in matching plates taken in the same filter we gridded the area scanned , and calibrated the intensity scale of the second plate to the scale of the first plate in each patch i.e. we forced the field effects on the second plate to match those on the first plate .",
    "a similar procedure was adopted in order to match the object catalogues from different passbands .",
    "the @xmath45 band was adopted as the reference passband and any field effects in the other photometric bands were forced to match any field effects present in the @xmath45 band .",
    "we used the shape and light profile information to classify the objects as stellar and non  stellar , combining the information from all the plates in order to improve the discrimination .",
    "finally we converted the intensities to a logarithmic scale and calibrated to magnitudes using ccd observations of several stars on each plate , as described below .      for the calibration we made ccd observations in the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath8 bands of selected fields .",
    "we also used the ccd @xmath1 photometry of the candidates themselves ( i.e. all a - type stars ) .",
    "we created @xmath61 and @xmath8 sequences from the a ",
    "star @xmath1 photometry using the relations : @xmath63 , for 0 @xmath64 0.2 ; @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 photometry was then converted into the @xmath68 natural system of the ukst using the relations ,    @xmath69    the number of stars which defined the calibration curve in any band was typically 25 .",
    "the colour equations quoted above are either taken from warren et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , or they were computed using the procedures described there .",
    "bearing in mind the earlier discussion of field effects , in establishing the photometric errors there are two terms to consider .",
    "there are random errors , which can be assessed for any band from the scatter in a plot of magnitude difference between the two plates as a function of magnitude ( warren et al .",
    "1991 , fig .",
    "3 ) . there are also systematic errors , due to field effects on the reference plate in the @xmath45 band , and these are the same in all passbands , due to the way in which the field effects in all plates were forced to match those on the reference @xmath45 plate .",
    "these systematic errors do not contribute to the uncertainties in the colours .",
    "they are larger than the random errors over the magnitude range of interest and were quantified by measuring the scatter in the calibration curves .",

    "this box is slightly different for each field because we have allowed for galactic reddening , since the targets are at large distances . in considering candidate selection ,",
    "the @xmath15 band is treated as identical to the @xmath60 band .",
    "this is because a stars have colours close to zero , so the difference between the @xmath15 and @xmath60 magnitudes for a stars , i.e. the product of a small colour and a small colour term , may be neglected .",
    "similarly the the difference in the extinction correction is negligible , because the reddening in these fields is small ( table 2 ) , and the wavelength difference between the bands is also small . in this subsection",

    "for each field we shifted the selection box along the reddening vector by an amount appropriate for the value of @xmath82 .",

    "the stars in this sample are prefixed with a ` c ' , standing for ` complete ' sample .",
    "the photometric calibration observations were , in fact , obtained as the survey progressed , and the candidate bhb stars had to be selected before the calibration stage .",
    "this was possible because the clump of a - type stars is clearly defined , and because the apm intensities are nearly linear with flux .",
    "the consequence of this is that some stars observed photometrically or spectroscopically fall just outside the selection boxes .",

    "it is certainly possible that we are dealing with a mixture of different types of stars , with each population characterised by distinct absolute magnitude ranges and hence distances .",
    "we note also that the preston & sneden ( 2000 ) stars are on average redder than the stars dicussed in this paper and may not be completely identical . notwithstanding these caveats",
