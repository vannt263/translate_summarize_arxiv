    "proximity focusing ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) counters with non - gaseous radiators have the advantage of smaller size and are thus well suited as particle identification devices within more complex particle spectrometers with tight space constraints .",
    "such a detector with aerogel as radiator is envisaged for the upgrade  @xcite of the particle identification system of the belle spectrometer at the kekb collider  @xcite . in the present belle detector , a threshold - type cherenkov detector ( acc )",
    "@xcite enables a good @xmath1 separation .",
    "however , acc does not provide sufficient separation for high momentum particles around @xmath2 in the forward end - cap region , and a proximity focusing rich with aerogel as radiator is being studied as a candidate for the detector upgrade .",
    "different aerogel radiators as well as different photon detectors have been investigated in search of an optimal counter , which would provide the required 4 - 5 @xmath3 pion - kaon separation in the 1 - 4 gev / c momentum range @xcite .",
    "good velocity resolution of a charged particle track requires good resolution of the cherenkov angle of a single photon and many detected photons .",
    "the number of photons may be increased by increasing the radiator thickness , but the price to pay is an increased uncertainty of the emission point , i.e. single photon angular resolution . however , by judiciously choosing the refractive indices of consecutive aerogel radiator layers , one may achieve overlapping of the corresponding cherenkov rings on the photon detector .",
    "this represents a sort of focusing of the photons within the radiator , and eliminates or at least considerably reduces the spread due to emission point uncertainty .",
    "another possibility is the opposite , i.e. to obtain separate rings from separate aerogel layers in which the emission point uncertainty is given by the thickness of the corresponding layer .",
    "one may also try combinations of the two main schemes .",
    "note that such a tuning of refractive index for individual layers is only possible with aerogel , which may be produced with any desired refractive index in the range 1.006 - 1.06 .",
    "while the principle was first discussed in  @xcite , the present work reports on measurements made with different combinations of aerogel radiator layers .",
    "first we present estimates of the relations between the radiator thicknesses and refractive indices in order to obtain either overlapping of the cherenkov rings or their adequate separation .",
    "next the experimental apparatus is described and the results of measurements and analysis are given . finally , we discuss the possibilities of such a detector to meet the expectations for the upgrade of the belle particle identification system .",

    "the key issue in the performance of a proximity focusing rich counter is to improve the cherenkov angle resolution per track @xmath6 . by using a thicker aerogel radiator ,",
    "the average number of detected photons @xmath7 can be increased , but the single photon cherenkov angle resolution @xmath8 degrades due to the increased uncertainty in the photon emission point . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal - d - normal ] , the optimal thickness should be around @xmath9 , which was also verified in previous investigations  @xcite .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to use a `` dual radiator '' scheme , where one images cherenkov photons from two aerogel radiators with different refractive indices as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - radiator ] . in the first combination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - radiator].b ) two aerogel radiators are used with slightly different indices , where the one with the lower refractive index is positioned upstream .",
    "if the indices of the two radiators are well adjusted , the corresponding two rings overlap . in the following this combination",
    "will be referred to as `` focusing combination '' .",
    "the other possibility is a `` defocusing combination '' , in which the aerogel with higher index is positioned upstream ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - radiator].c ) . if the difference of the indices of the two aerogel tiles is appropriately chosen , the two radiators produce two well separated rings with good resolution .",
    "principle of dual radiator and multiple radiator ring imaging cherenkov counter : ( a ) single radiator , ( b ) focusing dual radiator , ( c ) defocusing dual radiator , ( d ) focusing multiple radiator and ( e ) defocusing multiple radiator rich .",
    "only photons from the middle of the radiator are shown in ( d ) and ( e ) . ]",
    "-1 cm    a naive extension of the dual radiator combination is to use more than two aerogel radiators ( `` multiple radiator '' ) . for the focusing combination ,",
    "the indices of aerogels should gradually increase from the upstream to the downstream layer . again , if the index of each layer is well chosen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - radiator].d ) , the angular resolution of the ring will not be appreciably deteriorated in spite of a thicker radiator .",
    "the defocusing dual radiator may be extended to four radiators by introducing the focusing combination in every two layers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi - radiator].e . in this case , the rich has four radiators with different indices where the first two radiators in the upstream position create a larger ring , and the other two radiators a smaller ring .",
    "the relation between the refractive indices in the focusing combination in the dual radiator case is derived as follows . neglecting the refraction at aerogel boundaries and denoting the thickness of a single radiator tile as @xmath10 , the distance between the center of the downstream radiator and the photon detector plane as @xmath11 , and the cherenkov angles in both upstream and downstream radiator as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively",
    ", the condition that the two rings should overlap can be written as @xmath14 . from this condition",
    "the following approximate relation can be derived @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the pion mass and momentum .",
    "the optimization of the radiator parameters thus clearly depends on the kinematical region the counter should cover . in the case of the upgrade of the belle particle identification system ,",
    "the indices are optimized for tracks with @xmath18  gev/@xmath19 , the highest particle momenta from two - body @xmath20 decays .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : focus - p ] , the overlap of the two rings remains sufficiently good even at lower momenta , so that the emission point error ( full line ) does not significantly increase with respect to the single radiator case of half the thickness ( dashed line ) .",
    "emission point error for a focusing combination ( two 2  cm thick tiles with refractive indices 1.05 and 1.042 at a distance of 18  cm from the photon detector ) as a function of momentum for perpendicularly incident pions ( full line ) compared to the single radiator of half the thickness ( dashed ) . ]    -1 cm     emission point error for the focusing combination ( same as in fig .",

    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : focus - incang ] , only a modest increase in the emission point error is expected up to the maximal angle of incidence in the present application to the belle upgrade ( around 30@xmath24 ) .    for the dual radiator in the defocusing combination ,",
    "the requirements are much less demanding .",
    "the two rings have to be well separated , and none of them should coincide with the ring corresponding to the other particle species . if one requires for the case of @xmath1 separation that the kaon ring from the upstream radiator ( corresponding to the angle @xmath25 ) is separated by @xmath26 from the pion ring from the downstream radiator tile ( corresponding to the angle @xmath27 ) , one arrives at the following expression @xmath28 , from which one may derive a relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for a specific example with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath18  gev/@xmath19 and @xmath33  mrad , values typical for such a counter , we get @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "note that for both the focusing and defocusing combinations the performance of the counter can be further optimized by varying the ratio of the thicknesses of the two radiators and the total thickness of the radiator .",
    "we have performed two beam tests in march and june 2004 .",
    "the tests were carried out at the kek - ps @xmath36 and t1 beam lines , where pions with momenta up to @xmath2 are available .",

    "the surface of each pmt is divided into 64 ( @xmath40 ) channels with @xmath41 pixel size .",
    "this type of pmt is not immune to the magnetic field and can not be applied in the belle spectrometer , so this device is considered as an intermediate step in our development . for the final design ,",
    "we plan to use the hamamatsu hapd or the burle micro - channel plate pmt  @xcite .    as radiators",
    "the same set of aerogel samples was used as in the tests with single refractive index radiators  @xcite .",

    "in addition , newly produced aerogels with refractive indices up to @xmath45 were used , as well as two - layer aerogel samples  @xcite , where a single tile is comprised of two layers with different indices .",

    "both radiators have a thickness of @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig : march - focus - angle ] shows the resulting distribution of the cherenkov angle for single photons .",
    "note that the cherenkov angle is calculated by assuming that the photon is emitted in the middle of the combined radiator .",
    "the basic parameters of the counter , the resolution and the number of detected photons , are obtained by fitting to this distribution a gaussian function for the signal and a second order polynomial for the background .",
    "the resulting single photon resolution @xmath8 is @xmath52 , while the average number detected photons amounts to @xmath53 .",

    "-1 cm    for comparison , measurements were also performed for single radiator cases when only the upstream or the downstream aerogel tile of the dual radiator is used . for the upstream and downstream radiator ,",
    "the measured yield was @xmath56 and @xmath57 photons per ring , respectively .",

    "a fraction of photons emitted in the upstream radiator is scattered in the downstream aerogel .",
    "therefore , the photoelectron yield is expected to be @xmath60 , where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the number of the detected photons in the single radiator rich with only upstream ( downstream ) radiator , @xmath12 is the cherenkov angle in the upstream radiator , while @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the thickness and transmission length of the downstream radiator .",
