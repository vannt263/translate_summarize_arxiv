    "as the nearest spiral galaxy to our own , m31 allows the study of a galactic centre in unmatched detail .",
    "a particularly striking feature of high - resolution @xmath3- and @xmath4-band photometry of the central few arcseconds of m31 is its double nucleus @xcite : there are two peaks in surface brightness , the brighter of which ( known as p1 ) is extended and offset @xmath5 from the fainter peak ( known as p2 ) , which is elongated and close to the photometric centre of the bulge .",
    "early spectroscopic observations resolved steep gradients in the stellar rotation velocities and a prominent peak in the stellar velocity dispersion , which hints at the presence of a massive black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite put forward an elegant explanation for these observations : the nucleus is a massive disc of red stars on eccentric , nearly keplerian , approximately aligned orbits around a central black hole located at p2 ; p1 is generated by orbital crowding of stars lingering at apocentre .",
    "subsequent observations have been consistent with his model .",
    "@xcite observed the nucleus with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on the corrected hubble space telescope ( hst ) , confirming the bimodal structure .",
    "@xcite obtained spectroscopy with the subarcsecond imaging spectrograph ( sis ) finding an asymmetric rotation curve and a constant colour across the nucleus , showing p1 and p2 s colours to be consistent with each other but not the bulge or a globular cluster .",
    "further kinematics were recorded with the faint object camera @xcite , the integral field spectrograph oasis @xcite and the space telescope spectroscopy imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on hst @xcite .",
    "all of these observations show that the kinematic centre of the nucleus is very close to p2 , as predicted by t95 s eccentric disc model .",
    "further refinement of this picture has come from studying the nucleus at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "almost all of the uv emission from the nucleus comes from a tiny ( @xmath6 ) source located at p2 @xcite , whose optical  uv colours and spectra are consistent with a population of a stars @xcite , distinct from the red k - type spectrum of the rest of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that this compact , young , blue population has a maximum velocity dispersion of @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , significantly higher than the red stars @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "they label the uv peak p3 and have found that its photometry and kinematics are well modelled by a separate , almost - circular disc of blue stars around a central black hole of mass ( @xmath11-@xmath12 . this provides very strong evidence in support of the presence of a supermassive black hole , which is the most fundamental requirement of t95 s model .",
    "most recently , @xcite has found that the surface brightness profile of the young population is described by an exponential profile of scale length @xmath13 .",
    "tremaine s original eccentric disc model consisted of three keplerian orbits , coplanar with the main disc of m31 , projected onto the sky and convolved with gaussian point spread functions ( psfs ) .",
    "the original model included neither disc self - gravity nor a realistic treatment of the disc s internal velocity dispersions but was still able to broadly reproduce kinematic features . to be stable over many dynamical times",
    "such a disc would require apsidal alignment to be maintained ; t95 proposed that this could be achieved by the disc self - gravity and argued that two - body relaxation would lead to a disc thickness of @xmath14 times the disc radius .",
    "estimates of the disc mass from mass to light ratios place it at around @xmath15 .",
    "this is substantial enough to affect the dynamics of the disc although the nucleus falls within the sphere of influence of the black hole , which dominates the orbits and imposes regularity .",
    "a self - gravitating eccentric disc mode maintaining orbital alignment would also precess under a uniform pattern speed .",
    "since the t95 model , several _ two - dimensional _ self - gravitating models with these properties have been constructed @xcite .",
    "these massive models have found a variety of disc masses , pattern speeds and orbital distributions .",
    "@xcite took a different approach .",
    "they revised the 1995 model and constructed fully three - dimensional models with a parametric distribution function that ignored the self gravity of the disc ; the gravitational potential in their models is due solely to the central black hole , which greatly simplifies the modelling procedure .",
    "their models are the most successful to date at fitting the observed kinematics .",
    "they also found that thickened disc models that were misaligned with respect to the large - scale m31 disc produced significantly better fits than coplanar models , echoing a result seen in the 2d models .    the current picture of the nucleus",
    "( see figure  [ sample - figure ] ) has the black hole embedded in p3 , which is explained by a flat , circular exponential disc of blue stars 0033 from the photometric bulge centre . this young , blue disc is surrounded by the larger , red , eccentric disc .",
    "p1 is made of stars crowding at apoapsis , while p2 is now identified as stars at pericenter in the elongated region on the anti - p1 side of p3 .",
    "the system remains of great interest : the origin of the nuclei and the relationship between the red and blue populations are unexplained and the mass and pattern speed of precession of the disc have not been pinned down consistently .",
    "understanding the dynamics of the disc will help determine the bh mass more accurately which is of use in better determining the relationship between a bh and the host galaxy .",
    "it is also of interest to confirm whether the eccentric disc is aligned with the main disc of m31 .    in this paper",
    "we present a natural development of the modelling approach started by @xcite . like them",
    ", we ignore the self - gravity of the disc , leaving the construction of fully self - gravitating models for a subsequent paper . of considering",
    "parameterised functional forms for the phase - space distribution function ( hereafter df ) of the nucleus , we model the df non - parametrically as a mixture of gaussian rings whose amplitudes are allowed to vary : one of our goals is to `` let the data speak for themselves '' and then examine closely the structure of the df .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarise the data we use and additional post - processing applied .",
    "section 3 describes our modelling procedure and section 4 our results .",
    "section 5 sums up .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a distance of 770kpc to m31 .",
    "our models use observations from three instruments : the hst photometry recorded with wfpc2 , detailed in lauer et al 1998 ( hereafter l98 ) , the high resolution kinematics from stis ( bender et al 2005 , b05 ) and the kinematic maps from the integral field spectrograph oasis ( bacon et al 2001 , hereafter b01 ) .",
    "we use the deconvolved @xmath3-band ( f555w ) wfpc2 photometry of l98 .",
    "this image is 1024@xmath161024 pixels in size with a pixel scale of 0011375 .",
    "p3 is located at ( 513 , 518 ) .",
    "we note that the orientation of the image has north 82.3@xmath17 clockwise from the y - axis - the data has been rotated away from the original alignment of the ccd , so that the corners of the image are blank - but we make no attempt to reorient the image .",
    "this image has already been reduced and deconvolved but we perform some processing on the image in order to reduce this data to a tractable number of observables for our fitting procedure .",
    "bright foreground stars are first masked out and we crop the image to a 512@xmath16512 pixel region centred on p3 .",
    "this is a region of side 5824 and incorporates the nucleus and the inner parts of the bulge and removes the blank corners of the image .",
    "this cropped image is then rebinned to `` super - pixels '' of side @xmath18 pixels containing the mean of the @xmath19 pixels , with @xmath20 the number of masked pixels falling in the super - pixel .",
    "we consider two schemes for choosing super - pixels : in the first we simply take @xmath21 everywhere so that super - pixels contain a @xmath22 pixel region . in the other @xmath23",
    "is chosen based on the surface brightness of the image scaled by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius from p3 , to provide a good balance of detail around p2 and p1 .",
    "this gives @xmath26 ( the resolution of the deconvolved image ) at p1 and p2 and @xmath27 in the outermost parts of the image .",
    "a total of 4096 super - pixels are generated in this scheme .",
    "ajhar et al ( 1997 ) and lauer et al ( 1998 ) showed that that at the resolution of wfpc2 the underlying number of stars in m31 shows strong surface brightness fluctuations .",
    "the limited number of stars is the dominant residual between the structure of the nucleus and any model we fit .",
    "we treat the noise from the fluctuations as the sole source of our errors in our photometry and ignore photon noise so that the fractional error in a spatial bin is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective number of stars within the spatial bin .",
    "l98 gives the effective magnitude of each sbf `` star '' as @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "the error associated with a spatial bin containing @xmath32 is therefore @xmath33 .",
    "the stis kinematics are taken from table 5 of @xcite . these consist of the bulge - subtracted gauss ",
    "hermite coefficients derived with the fourier correlation quotient method at the 22 positions listed for each of @xmath3 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and their accompanying errors .",
    "we adopt the same slit widths of 0.1and position angle of 39@xmath17 .",
    "the quoted positions are given with respect to the location of p3 .",
    "we use equation ( 21 ) of @xcite to model the stis psf .",
    "when this is convolved with a a @xmath37-square top hat to represent the slit , the result is well approximated by a double gaussian @xmath38 with amplitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 and dispersions @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "we assume that equation   as the effective psf of the stis observations",
    ". a more sophisticated treatment might take account of asymmetries in the psf and the variations in spatial binning along the slit .",
    "we also make use of the kinematics of the integral field spectrograph oasis , which were kindly provided by eric emsellem .",
    "we opt to use the higher s / n data set , m8 .",
    "this consists of @xmath3 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 values derived from spectra taken at 1123 positions , spaced by 009 .",
    "we registered the image with the wfpc2 data using a similar process to b01 .",
    "we found a close match in angle ( 0.7@xmath17 ) and a small offset of ( -002 , -003 ) between the two images .",
    "like b01 we assumed that the oasis measurements have a psf that can be described by a sum of three gaussians and allowed the parameters of these gaussians to float freely in the registration process , taking the form @xmath43 the resulting psf differs from that found by b01 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "our models are straightforward generalisations of those of pt . in particular",
    ", we ignore the self gravity of the disc and the gravitational influence of the bulge and assume that the potential is purely keplerian .",
    "the mass of the central black hole @xmath49 is the single free parameter in our model potential .",
    "we assume that the bh is located at p3 .      following pt03 we use three different coordinate systems : `` orbit plane '' , `` disc plane '' and `` sky plane '' .",
    "all three coordinate systems have origin @xmath50 coincident with the bh .",
    "our models have biaxial symmetry .",
    "this provides a natural definition of the `` disc plane '' @xmath51 coordinate system : the model is symmetric under reflections in the @xmath52 and planes .",
    "the orbit - plane and sky - plane coordinate systems are defined as follows . in the potential of the bh all orbits are keplerian ellipses .",
    "an orbit with semi - major axis @xmath53 and eccentricity @xmath54 defines a coordinate system @xmath55 in which the @xmath56 axis is parallel to the orbit s angular momentum vector and the @xmath57 axis points towards pericentre .",

    "any orbit in the keplerian potential of the bh can be labelled by the five integrals of motion @xmath67 , but it proves convenient to replace @xmath54 and @xmath65 by the eccentricity vector @xmath68 , where the longitude of periapsis @xmath69 .",
    "the vector @xmath70 points from the bh towards the projection of the pericentre onto the @xmath71 disc plane .",
    "its magnitude is the scalar eccentricity  @xmath54 of the orbit .",

    "the @xmath78 axis then points _ towards _ the observer ; the line - of - sight velocity is therefore @xmath79 , following the usual convention that that receding objects have @xmath80 .",
    "we model only the old stellar population of the disc ; the young stars around p3 and the bulge are treated as contaminants ( see  [ sec : bulge ] below ) .",
    "assuming that the old stars are collisionless and homogenous , their dynamics can be completely described by a distribution function ( df ) @xmath81 , defined such that @xmath82 is the expected number of such stars within a small phase - space volume @xmath83 around the point @xmath84 .",

    "our first attempt at fitting the stis kinematics was based on the same assumption that we could use the stis @xmath3 and @xmath34 measured by b+05 as direct estimates of the ( stis psf - convolved ) first- and second - order moments of the losvd .",
    "that did not work well : at stis resolution the losvds are far from gaussian , as we show on figure  [ fig : typlosvd ] , and the strong high - velocity wings caused by the bh mean that it is not possible to obtain reliable estimates of the first and second moments from the observed spectra .",
    "this last point was one of the motivations for the introduction of gauss ",

    "figure  [ fig : wfpc ] shows how well the @xmath260 model fits to the wfpc2 photometry .",
    "results for the other two black hole masses are similar .",
    "the agreement is good in the central regions , but beyond about 1 arcsec from p2 the model s surface brightness profile falls off too slowly compared to the observations .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that our model is simply too coarse ; the thickness of each of the @xmath266 rings ( equ .",
    "[ eq : ring ] ) in these models is @xmath267 , which sets the models characteristic radial spatial resolution .",
    "another is that our model for the contribution of the bulge light ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bulge ] ) may be wrong within the innermost couple of arcsec .    based on these comparisons ,",
    "we interpret the relatively low values of @xmath188 of our models not as a indication of the outstanding quality of our model fits , but instead as a sign that the treatment of the observational uncertainties  particularly of the wfpc2 photometry  could be improved .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the reader will agree that simple `` chi - by - eye '' tests indicate that our models produce the best fits to date of the m31 eccentric disc system .",
    "of course , this is to be expected given that we have @xmath268 free parameters to play with , which is at least an order of magnitude more than most previous models of m31 s nucleus .",
    "what can we learn from all these free parameters , specifically the orbit weights @xmath180 ?",
    "figure  [ fig : df ] shows two views of the df of our best - fit model .",
    "this model has a strong negative eccentricity gradient between 05 and 12 ( corresponding to p1 ) , which is very similar to pt03 s best - fit model ; even the dispersion in eccentricity ( figure  [ fig : dfsig ] ) is similar to their value of @xmath269 .",
    "there are three important differences between our model and theirs , however .    1 .   beyond 12",
    "the mean eccentricity in our models becomes negative , meaning that the rings become mildly antialigned .",
    "we find that the strength of this feature depends on the details of our bulge model and so it is hard to judge its significance , but we note that just such a feature was predicted by @xcite in his analysis of thin , self - gravitating discs .",
    "2 .   whereas pt03 s parametrised model had an exponentially declining @xmath270 profile ,",
    "our model fits a @xmath270 profile that _ increases _ with radius for @xmath271 .",
    "this last point is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of collisional models of disc evolution @xcite .",
    "the detailed agreement is not so good though : whereas the collisional models predict @xmath272 , our models fit @xmath273 .",
    "it is not immediately clear , however , how far one can apply these calculations that assume almost circular @xmath274 discs to the strongly eccentric disc in m31 .",
    "3 .   @xmath275 in our model falls steeply towards the centre from @xmath276 to @xmath277 , inside which there is antialigned ( @xmath278 ) , fat ( @xmath279 ) distribution of orbits .",
    "recall that the range of @xmath270 reproducible by our chosen sample of rings is from @xmath280 to @xmath281 .",
    "this distinctive change in the distribution of the red stars is almost cospatial with the young , a - star population that make up p3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : faceedge ] shows the face - on and edge - on projected density distributions of our best - fit model .",
    "our machinery fits a density distribution which , when viewed face on , is broadly similar to the density distribution adopted by @xcite in their self - gravitating razor - thin models .",
    "apart from our neglect of self gravity , the most significant difference between our models and theirs is that ours have a secondary density peak around p2 and also have significant thickness .",
    "although the models we present in this section are not fit to the oasis maps , we can nevertheless compare our reconstructed models predictions against the real oasis maps .",
    "figure  [ fig : oasis ] shows the results for the @xmath260 model .",
    "the model reproduces the shape and orientation of velocity and dispersion maps very well .",
    "this provides an independent test of the orientation angles and the broad - brush features of the df inferred by our models .",
    "finally , we note that one proposed origin of the eccentric disc in m31 is from an @xmath282 instability in an initially circular stellar disc that contains a small counter - rotating population of stars @xcite .",
    "@xmath283-body simulations of this instability @xcite show that the dominant , prograde population becomes the eccentric disc , while the minor , population is puffed up into a strongly triaxial distribution . as a quick experiment to test whether this is easily detectable , we have tried doubling up our ring distribution by including in our models the retrograde ring corresponding to each of the 720 prograde rings considered .",
    "this produces a noticeably better fit to the observations , with @xmath284 instead of 812 , three main counter - rotating components ( figure  [ fig : dfplusminus ] ) at @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "none of these is easily identifiable with the more diffuse component predicted by @xcite , although we suspect that that might be hard to detect with naive models such as ours .",
    "we interpret the innermost retrograde ring as suggesting that our ring - based decomposition fails at radii @xmath288 , perhaps by not being fine enough .",
    "similarly , we take the presence of the other two rings as a hint that our bulge model could perhaps be improved .",
    "we have constructed an eccentric disc models of the nucleus of m31 by modelling it as a linear combination of fattened rings of stars orbiting in a purely keplerian potential .",
    "our models are an obvious generalisation of those of pt03 and  as expected  are noticeably ( albeit perhaps not significantly ) more successful at reproducing the features observed in the inner arcsec or so of m31 .",
    "one of the most fundamental parameters of any model of this system is its orientation . like pt03",
    ", we assume that the disc has biaxial symmetry , but we find some differences in the euler angles @xmath74 that specify the orientation of these symmetry axes .",
    "our values of @xmath237 and @xmath289 agree reasonably well with their @xmath290 and @xmath291 , but our value of @xmath292 ( which directly controls the position angle on the sky ) differs significantly from their @xmath293 , more than can be accounted for by the effects of shot noise in either the models or in the distribution of stars in the real disc .",
    "our orientation is also consistent with the n - body model of b01 ( @xmath294 and @xmath295 ) and the models of @xcite ( @xmath296 and assumed @xmath297 ) and @xcite ( @xmath298 and @xmath299 ) , though it should be noted all these models are 2d which imposes constraints on their geometry ; @xcite obtained their orientation by de - projecting the photometry of the disc such that the outer isophotes became circular .",
    "we note that these values of @xmath191 found for the old , red distribution of stars are close to the inclination of the young population in p3 ( @xmath300 ) measured by b+05 .",
    "the most interesting result of our models is the df they infer from the data , bearing in mind that they contain no prior `` wisdom '' about which dfs are dynamically plausible .",
    "the models the presence of a distinct , compact disc of red stars within 015 of the black hole .",
    "this disc is anti - aligned ( with eccentricity @xmath301 ) with respect to the larger - scale eccentric disc ( which has @xmath302 ) . outside this compact region",
    "the eccentricity distribution of our models is very similar to pt03 s .",
    "the main difference between our models and theirs is in the inclination distribution : our models fit an rms inclination profile @xmath303 that closely tracks the dispersion in eccentricity , with @xmath304 .",
    "this is interesting : models of the collisional evolution of ( circular ) discs predict that this ratio should be @xmath305 .",
    "another difference between our models and pt03 is that we find evidence for an anti - aligned feature @xmath306 at @xmath307 .",
    "however , the details of this feature depend on our assumed bulge model , which merits further investigation .",
    "our models prefer black hole masses @xmath49 of the order of @xmath308 ; masses higher than about @xmath309 are weakly ruled out .",
    "although it would be possible to use our machinery to carry out a full scan of black hole masses and orientation angles , followed by a systematic investigation of the degeneracies in the df , we believe that a more pressing task is to include the self gravity of the disc .",
    "the stars contribute a significant fraction ( @xmath310 ) of the mass of the bh+eccentric disc system , which means that it is dangerous to read too much into our present , purely keplerian models .",
    "past 2d ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) models have shown it is possible to get plausibly good fits to the kinematics for large disc masses .",
    "the space of 3d disc distributions that project to yield the observed surface brightness profile is degenerate , but our orbital ring system serves as a good starting point for this investigation .",
