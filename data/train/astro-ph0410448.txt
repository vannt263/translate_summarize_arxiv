    "in a @xmath8cdm universe , the inner regions of massive galaxies like the milky way gain a large fraction of their mass through tidal disruption and accretion of a large number of low - mass fragments ( e.g van den bosch , tormen & giocoli 2004 ) .",
    "the fossil records of these merging processes may be observable nowadays in form of long tidal streams or large - scale stellar substructures around the parent spiral galaxies .",
    "numerical galaxy formation simulations show that dynamical friction brings sub - structures from outer halo regions to the neighbourhood of the parent galaxies disks .",
    "if haloes are flattened ( oblate ) and their axi - symmetry plane is that of the disk , orbits of non - polar satellite galaxies tend to become co - planar and circularise with time ( pearrubia , kroupa & just 2004 ) . in this scenario , tidal debris of several disrupted satellite galaxies",
    "might have contributed to the formation of the stellar disk if they followed nearly circular orbits with a low orbital inclination at late times of their evolution ( navarro 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the milky way is an important laboratory in which the predictions of this cosmological scenario can be tested . in the last decade ,",
    "large - scale surveys have proved the existence of tidal streams ( sgr : ibata et al .",
    "1994 ; monoceros : newberg et al . 2002 ) in our galaxy , providing strong observational evidence that disruption of dwarf satellites contributes to the assembly of some components of our galaxy .",
    "these tidal streams offer an unique opportunity to study accretion events in considerable detail using the chemical , kinematic and spatial distribution of tidal stream s stars , which can be directly compared against predictions of n - body simulations of merging events ( e.g law , johnston & majewski 2004 ) .",
    "recently , the sloan digitized sky survey team reported the discovery of a coherent ring - like structure at low galactic latitude spanning about 100 degrees in the sky ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ; yanny et al .",
    "follow - up observations ( ibata et al . 2003 ) found that this structure of low metallicity stars surrounds the galactic disk at galactocentric distances from @xmath9 15 kpc to @xmath10 kpc .",
    "different groups proposed two different scenarios to explain the nature of this feature in the outer galactic disk ( see helmi et al .",
    "2003 ) : i ) a new tidal stream ( yanny et al .",
    "2003 ) ; and ii ) a stellar ring resulting from perturbations in the disk similar to the remnants of ancient warps ( ibata et al .",
    "2003 ) . tracing this structure with 2mass m giant stars , rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2003 ) concluded that its structural characteristics are consistent with the interpretation of this structure as the fossil of a merging dwarf galaxy , similar to the sgr dwarf galaxy ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) , in the galactic plane .",
    "interestingly , frinchaboy et al . ( 2004 ) and crane et al . (",
    "2003 ) also suggested some nearby galactic open and globular clusters with coordinated heliocentric radial velocities , indicating a possible common origin with the tidal stream .    unlike the sagittarius dwarf galaxy",
    ", the monoceros stream has been detected prior to locating the main body of the parent galaxy .",
    "the location is still controversial . from the analysis of the 2mass catalogue , martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) reported a strong elliptical - shaped stellar over - density in the constellation of canis major , which is coincident in position and radial velocity with a small group of 4 globular clusters ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] ) . using a fairly simple model , they identify the cma over - density as the main body of the progenitor dwarf galaxy of the monoceros stream ( named canis major dwarf ) .",
    "bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented colour - magnitude diagrams in the surroundings of the cma location , concluding that the system is situated at 8@xmath11 1 kpc from the sun and it is composed by a metal - rich , intermediate - age population .",
    "momany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , however , comparing proper motions and radial velocities of canis major m - giant stars , obtain that the overdensity in this region mimics the thick disk kinematics . moreover , they find that the star counts in that region are those expected in the standard milky way model if taking into account the warp and flare of the disk .",
    "however , a deep colour - magnitude diagram of the center of the canis majoris over - density by martnez - delgado et al .",
    "( 2004 ) shows a very well - defined main - sequence consistent with a limited extent in distance , confirming that this stellar population is associated with a distinct , possibly still bound stellar system with properties ( surface brightness , absolute magnitude , stellar content ) compatible with those of local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies . in base of these last results",
    ", the canis major overdensity will be referred to the cma dwarf galaxy in this work .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of an extensive search of possible disruption scenarios of satellite galaxies to explore : a ) how many of the over - density signatures can be attributed to a single stream and b ) to constrain its progenitor orbit .",
    "with an objective criterion we select those orbits that reproduce the spatial and kinematical distribution of candidate debris . beyond exploring the possible progenitor location ,",
    "the results will : ( i ) help to carry out new surveys in different regions of the sky and ( ii ) constrain the thick disk formation history through the distribution evolution of stripped stars .",
    "this contribution has been organised as follows : in section  [ sec : obs ] we compile the observational data available so far .",
    "section  [ sec : tools ] outlines the galaxy and satellite models that we use in our investigation .",
    "we also describe our semi - analytic orbit algorithm and the results of the orbital parameter survey .",
    "we obtain the distribution of debris via the n - body algorithm sketched in section  [ sec : nbody ] . in section  [ sec : res ] we compare the best - fit orbit with the observational data , whereas in section  [ sec : dis ] we comment different implications of our results .",
    "for the present work , we have attempted a comprehensive compilation of observational constraints on the geometry and kinematics of the monoceros stream . given the great deal of activity in detecting tidal streams in general , given the diversity of available data sets , and given in particular the great interest in the monoceros stream spawned by the original discovery ,",
    "the constraints are both numerous and inhomogeneous .",
    "typically , detections of overdensities have resulted from photometry , finding an axcess of main - sequence stars or m - giants at a given apparent magnitude .",
    "depending on the tracer population , this approach provides distance estimates of differing quality .",
    "radial velocities are available for a sub - set of stars within a sub - set of directions with detected overdensities . in principle , also the chemical composition of stars can serve as a constraint , as it can be expected to vary continuously along the stream , presumably with decreasing metallicity in the most loosely bound ( and hence first lost ) material .",
    "finally , proper motions ( which typically can be measured to @xmath12 3 - 4 mas / year ) can provide some rough contraints ; their precision in physical units is , however , only @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the sun and 4.74 is the factor that coverts [ kpc mas / yr ] into [ km / s ] .",

    "therefore , the available data ( including radial velocities from rocha - pinto et al . 2004 ) on the tri / and stream were then included as inputs in a second iteration of our survey of the best - candidate orbit to better constrain its properties and reduce the number of possible scenarios .",
    "finally , we explicitly test whether the canis majority dwarf is likely part of of the stream , presumably the parent of the tidal debris .",
    "we do this by omitting cma in the dirst modelling , and then comparing its orbit with that of our model for a possible monoceros stream progenitor .",
    "in this section we outline how we perform the orbital analysis of dwarf satellites and the method used to fit numerical orbits to the observational data .",

    "( ii ) once the orbital constraints are known , we carry out n - body simulations to analyze the spatial and kinematical distribution of debris .",
    "our dynamical model for the milky way follows hernquist ( 1993 ) , where : ( i ) the disk is exponential in the radial direction and isothermal in the vertical direction ; ( ii ) the bulge is described by a hernquist model ( hernquist 1990 ) with spherical symmetry ; ( iii ) the halo follows a flattened , non - singular isothermal profile with given core and cut - off radius .",

    "when constructing flattened dmhs with embedded bulges and disks , we apply a highly efficient technique using multipole potential expansions to tailor the local velocity ellipsoid to the required morphology ( boily , kroupa & pearrubia 2001 ) .",
    "the algorithm to add together individual components in a single galaxy is adapted from hernquist ( 1993 ) .",
    "this code scales linearly with particle number and hence we can construct flattened dmhs with @xmath60 particles in a short computational time .",
    "the specific parameters are chosen to reproduce the observed rotational curve of the milky way .",
    "the only free parameter of the galaxy model that we explore in our calculations is the halo axis - ratio ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the dwarf satellite model follows a king profile ( king 1966 ) with central potential @xmath61 and concentration @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the tidal and king radii , respectively .",
    "since we are assuming that the tidal debris represent multiple wraps ( and thus , multiple perigalacticon passages ) of the tidal stream originating from one disrupting satellite , we restrict the tidal radius of the progenitor dwarf galaxy in each model with the following criteria : ( i ) the tidal radius must be small enough to prevent galaxy disruption by the first peri - galacticon passage and ( ii ) the tidal radius must be large enough to induce a progressive mass loss that leads to the formation of a tidal stream .",
    "we have selected the satellite tidal radius to match the jacobi limit ( section 7.3 of binney & tremaine 1986 ) at the first peri - galacticon , which is a simple method to achieve slow mass loss along the orbit .      given the milky way and satellite mass profiles ,",

    "this figure shows that stream detections presented in this work are unlikely related to the thick disk population because ( i ) they are located in a narrow range of co - planar distances ( @xmath237 ) , as one would expect for debris from a disrupting galaxy in a nearly circular orbit ; ( ii ) they present a large vertical dispersion , of approximately 20 kpc which can not be reconciled with a disc - like structure and ( iii ) they have been detected in positions where the fraction of thick disk stars is @xmath23810% of the total number of stars in that direction .",
    "the only doubtful data might be found in the colour - magnitude detections at @xmath239 kpc , which lie within 90% fraction of thick disk stars .",
    "these points correspond to what our model identifies as the `` close ring '' , which presents a higher metallicity than more distant detections . + it is interesting to note that stars stripped from the monoceros stream progenitor have not yet contributed to the thick disk population .",
    "the decay rate of the dwarf galaxy appears slower ( around 3 kpc in 3 gyr ) than the mass loss rate ( 50% in the same time period ) , so that the dwarf galaxy will be likely detstroyed before reaching the inner regions of the thick disc . the mass loss process , however , depends on the initial structural parameters of the dwarf , which were fixed _",
    "ad hoc _ in this work .",
    "more accurate measurements of the stream surface brightness will provide better estimations of its survival time .",
    "in this paper , we have used a combined semi - analytic / n - body technique to explore the nature and origin of the monoceros tidal stream . this method has allowed us to explore a large parameter space in a systematic way , with the goal of constraining the orbital properties of the monoceros stream .",
    "+ we have found that the available observational data at the present day is sufficient to robustly constrain some aspects of the monoceros stream history and progenitor . in particular : ( i ) the heliocentric distance range at which the stream is observed plus the heliocentric radial velocity curve determines an orbital eccentricity of @xmath240 , ( ii ) the range of galactic latitudes indicates an orbital inclination of @xmath241 from the disk plane and , lastly , ( iii ) proper motions of stream stars are only compatible with a prograde orbit .",
    "we found that it is considerably less straightforward to predict the main body position through numerical calculations .",
    "the range of distances , the radial velocity curve and the vertical extension of debris are relatively insensitive to the final location of the satellite galaxy , since they define a given volume in phase - space that the progenitor fills up after several wraps .",
    "yet , the projected positions of stream tails are time - dependent reflecting , therefore , the position of the main system or , equivalently , the final integration time of our n - body model .",
    "+ besides the uncertainty in the satellite remnant position , the lack of detections at low galactic latitudes ( owing to disk absorption within @xmath242 ) as well as for a complete range of galactic longitudes makes difficult to constrain the location of the main system . owing to these limitations , our model matches the geometrical and kinematical distribution of debris if the main system remnants locate within the range @xmath165 , corresponding to integration times from 2.66 to 3.04 gyr .",
    "+ on the other hand , observations show that close detections of the stream have higher metalicities than the distant ones , which provides an additional constraint to our model .",
    "we have used this constraint by assuming that the progenitor s stellar metalicities are related to their initial binding energy .",
    "in particular , we assume that stars with low binding energies move , in average , in the outer satellite regions and , therefore , should present lower metalicities than those with high binding energies . by comparing the initial binding energy ( metallicity ) distribution with observations for the range of locations commented above ,",
    "we find that the metallicity gradient between the distant and the close detections can only be reproduced for integration times longer than 2.9 gyr . in that case",
    ", the main system location ( @xmath243 , @xmath244 ) is similar to that of the canis major dwarf , with a heliocentric distance of @xmath175 kpc .",
    "the treatment employed to determine the distribution of metalicities in the stream is , however , approximate , because have no way of knowing the initial metallicity gradient in the stream progenitor .",
    "moreover , we implicitly assume that detections with different metalicities reflect an initial property of the progenitor .",
    "other scenarios are possible and , for example , we can not discard that streams with different metalicities at different distances belong to different progenitors .",
    "the best - fitting model predicts a halo axis - ratio of @xmath124 .",
    "however , the poorly - constrained selection function of observations and the incomplete area coverage leads to degenerated solutions for different values of @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , we find that similar fits can be obtained with halo axis - ratios @xmath245 $ ] .",
    "the model we present here is , therefore , far from being definitive .",
    "future detections , mapping larger areas of the sky , will provide more constrains on the progenitor s orbit and a better determination of parameters listed in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "new detections are also necessary to constrain the progenitor location by means of numerical models .    with the recently available kinematical data of the canis major dwarf , which martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) claim to be the progenitor of the monoceros stream , we have integrated the orbit backwards in time , comparing its orbital properties against those of our model .",
    "we find contradictory points in favour and against that suggestion :      * the orbital eccentricity of cma ( @xmath246 ) and orbital sense of motion ( prograde ) are consistent with those of our model . *",
    "the cma s projected location ( @xmath184 , @xmath247 ) is consistent with the geometrical and metallicity constrains imposed by the monoceros stream stars . * the orbital inclination ( @xmath7 deg . )",
    "is consistent with that of our model within @xmath195 errors from proper motions . * the radial velocity of cma ( @xmath248 km / s ) is also similar to that of our model ( @xmath249 km / s ) and presents a low dispersion incompatible with thick disk features .",
    "* the orbits of globular clusters ngc 1851 , 1904 and 2298 , which bellazzini , ferraro & ibata ( 2003 ) and martin et al .",
    "( 2004a ) claim to be an evidence that the cma over - density region is the remnant of the monoceros stream progenitor , are inconsistent with the orbit of cma , since ngc 1851 and ngc 1904 move on highly eccentric orbits and ngc 2298 on a retrograde , eccentric one . * the bimodality in the velocity distribution of cma s m - giant stars ( martin et al .",
    "2004b ) can be reproduced by our model in regions where the projected positions of two stream tails overlap .",
    "that bimodality in @xmath250 can not be observed in the central part of our satellite model since the surface density is several orders of magnitude larger than that of overlapping stream tails .",
    "this fact seems to point out to a possible contamination of background giant stars in the sample used to measure proper motions and the radial velocity of the main system . as a result",
    ", the orbital inclination might have been underestimated . *",
    "the main body of our best - fit model s progenitor is @xmath251 kpc from the sun  twice as distant as the observed canis majoris stellar structure .",
    "since the mass of our model is poorly constrained , larger mass values can not be rejected . in particular ,",
    "dynamical friction would drive our satellite model down to 7.2 kpc in 3 gyr for an initial mass of approximately @xmath252 , whereas our best - fitting model has an approximate initial mass of @xmath253 .",
    "it remains unclear , however , whether the resulting distribution of debris from such a massive satellite undergoing tidal disruption would also reproduce the observations .",
    "unfortunately , with the results obtained in this work we can not unambigously determine whether the orbit of the cma dwarf is consistent with that of the monoceros stream progenitor , partly due to the uncertainty in the available observational data .",
    "more strict criteria to select stars that belong to the cma dwarf appear necessary to obtain reliable measurements of the kinematical properties of this system .",
