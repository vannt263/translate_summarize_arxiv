    "2010 ) revealed prototype y dwarfs ( cushing et al .",
    "2011 ) , with @xmath20 300  450  k. the extension of the lower main - sequence to the brown dwarfs now spans a range in luminosity of @xmath21 to @xmath22 l@xmath23 , and in mass of @xmath24 to 10 m@xmath12 .",
    "the t and y dwarfs are more similar to the gas - giant planets than to the stars , and clouds complicate the analysis of their spectra .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of l dwarfs are reddened by clouds consisting of liquid and solid iron and silicates ( e.g. ruiz , leggett & allard 1997 ; ackerman & marley 2001 ; tsuji 2002 ; helling et al .",
    "the transition from l to t is associated with a clearing of these clouds , such that mid - type t dwarfs have clear atmospheres ( e.g. knapp et al .",

    "liu et al . ( 2012 , their appendix a ) show that small differences in the @xmath30 bandpass can lead to significant differences in t and y dwarf photometry .",

    "as the largest set of @xmath30-band photometry has been obtained via the ukidss project , it is assumed that the ukirt / wfcam filter defines the @xmath30-band of the mko photometric system , and in the plots shown in this paper we have reduced the niri @xmath30-band magnitudes by 0.17 .",

    "we have carried out aperture photometry on the archived data , using the mosaics produced by the spitzer pipeline s18.18.0 .",
    "for all but one source , apertures with radii of 6 pixels or diameter 7.2 \" were used ; due to a nearby star , smaller apertures were used for wisepc j1541@xmath272250 of radius 3 and 4.5 pixels for the 3.6  @xmath5 m and 4.5  @xmath5 m channels respectively .",
    "aperture corrections were derived from stars in the field for wisepc j1541@xmath272250 , and from the irac handbook for the other brown dwarfs . in all cases sky levels were determined from concentric annular regions .",
    "uncertainties were derived from the sky variance .",
    "we find differences between our values and those of kirkpatrick et al . of typically 10% for the fainter 3.6  @xmath5 m data , and 5% for the brighter 4.5  @xmath5 m data .",
    "the differences are likely due to different data reduction techniques .",
    "table 2 lists the _ wise _ magnitudes as given by the wise all - sky data release and the irac magnitudes as determined by us .",
    "figure 2 plots the difference between the magnitudes measured in the similar passbands irac [ 3.6 ] and _ wise _ w1 , and irac [ 4.5 ] and _ wise _ w2 ; w1 extends the [ 3.6 ] bandpass to the blue , and w2 extends [ 4.5 ] to the red .",
    "the difference between w2 and [ 4.5 ] magnitudes is small for t and y dwarfs .",
    "w1 is significantly fainter than [ 3.6 ] for t dwarfs , because the bandpass extends into a region with very little flux .",
    "the single y dwarf detected in w1 is wise j1541@xmath272250 .",
    "the apparently low w1 @xmath27 [ 3.6 ] value for this object is likely to be spurious , as the _ wise _ images show no clear w1 source at the position of the w2 source , but does show other , bluer , nearby sources . the t8.5 dwarf wolf 940b ( burningham et al .",
    "2009 ) also stands out in figure 2 .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2010b ) use near- and mid - infrared spectroscopy and photometry to show that wolf 940b is a fairly typical late - type t dwarf with @xmath42  k and @xmath43 ( cm s@xmath44 ) .",
    "most likely the _ wise _ photometry for this object is compromised by the presence of the close and infrared - bright primary , as is suggested by the _ wise _ images .",
    "the models used here are described in detail in morley et al .",
    "the model atmospheres are as described in saumon & marley ( 2008 ) and marley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , with updates to the line list of nh@xmath7 and of the collision - induced absorption of h@xmath6 as described in saumon et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . to these models ,",
    "morley et al . have added absorption and scattering by condensates of cr , mns , na@xmath6s , zns and kcl .",
    "these condensates have been predicted to be present by lodders ( 1999 ) and visscher , lodders & fegley ( 2006 ) .",
    "morley et al .",
    "use the ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) cloud model to account for these previously neglected clouds .",
    "the vertical cloud extent is determined by balancing upward turbulent mixing and downward sedimentation .",
    "a parameter @xmath45 describes the efficiency of sedimentation , and is the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the convective velocity ; lower values of @xmath45 imply thicker ( i.e. more vertically extended ) clouds .",
    "we have found that our models which include iron and silicate grains and which have @xmath45 of typically 2  3 fit l dwarf spectra well , those with @xmath45 3  4 fit t0 to t3 spectral types well , and cloud - free models fit t4  t8 types well ( e.g. stephens et al .",
    "2009 , saumon & marley 2008 ) .",
    "however for later spectral types significant discrepancies exist between our models and the observations in the near - infrared ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) .",
    "the new models with chloride and sulfide clouds show that these clouds are significant for dwarfs with @xmath46 ",
    "900  k ( approximately t7 to y1 spectral types ) , with a peak impact at around 600  k ( or t9 types ) ; na@xmath6s is the dominant species by mass , however at 400  k kcl is also important .",
    "a suite of models was generated with @xmath47  k@xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "below @xmath51 water clouds are expected to form , which have not yet been incorporated into the models ( although water condensation is accounted for by removal of water from the gas opacity ) .",
    "the chloride and sulfide clouds impact the 0.6  1.3  @xmath5 m wavelength region in particular , corresponding to the @xmath52 photometric passbands .",
    "this otherwise clear region of the photosphere becomes opaque , and the flux emitted at these wavelengths then arises from a higher atmospheric layer that is cooler by around 200  k. the 1  @xmath5 m flux is therefore significantly reduced by the presence of these clouds .",
    "morley et al .",
    "show that the new models which include the chloride and sulfide clouds reproduce the observations of late - type t dwarfs much better than is done by models without these clouds .",
    "in particular , for the well - studied 500  k brown dwarf ugps j0722@xmath270540 , with data that covers optical to mid - infrared wavelengths , the sed is fit remarkably well with a @xmath19  k , @xmath53 , @xmath54 model . the one region that is not fit well is the 5  @xmath5 m region , where the models are too bright by a factor of @xmath40 2 .",
    "this is because the cloudy models do not currently include departures from chemical equilibrium caused by vertical mixing .",
    "the mixing enhances the abundance of co and co@xmath6 and reduces the @xmath55 m flux ( morley et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ) .",
    "it can be parametrized with an eddy diffusion coefficient of @xmath56 @xmath57 s@xmath58 , where values of log @xmath59  6 , corresponding to mixing timescales of @xmath60 yr to @xmath61 hr , respectively , reproduce the observations of t dwarfs ( e.g. saumon et al .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find that ugps j0722@xmath270540 is undergoing vigorous mixing , with log @xmath62  6.0 , which results in an increase of w2 by @xmath63 magnitude ( their figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "cloudless equilibrium and non - equilibrium models imply that the impact on the w2 or [ 4.5 ] magnitudes is around @xmath64 magnitudes for @xmath65  k @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "given that the impact for the 500  k dwarf ugps j0722@xmath270540 is of a similar order , and that co is dredged up into atmospheres as cool as jupiter s ( e.g. noll et al . 1988 ) , for simplicity here we add 0.3 magnitudes to the w2 and [ 4.5 ] magnitudes computed for all the model sequences used in this paper , at all values of @xmath18 , to mimic the effect of vertical mixing .",
    "we find below that such a correction reproduces the observed trends in t and y dwarf w2 colors quite well ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "our next generation of models will incorporate water clouds and mixing .",

    "colors are calculated using saumon & marley ( 2008 ) cloud - free evolution model grids , and all are in the vega system .",
    "our sample for this work consists of brown dwarfs with spectral type t6 and later , that have been detected in the w2 band , and that have mko - system near - infrared photometry .",
    "eighty - three brown dwarfs satisfy these criteria at the time of writing .",
    "the appendix contains a data table which gives , for these 83 brown dwarfs : coordinates , spectral type , distance modulus , @xmath69[3.6][4.5][5.8][8.0]w1w2w3w4 photometry , uncertainties in distance modulus and photometry , and source references .",

    "we find that wisep j0410 + 1502 , wisep j1738@xmath12732 and wisepc j2056@xmath11459 have @xmath39  450  k , @xmath86 and @xmath11 ( based on the @xmath72 and @xmath73 colors ) .",
    "wisepc j1405@xmath15534 and wisepc j1541@xmath272250 are cooler than covered by the cloudy models , but the cloud - free models indicate @xmath87  k and 300  350  k respectively .",
    "trends in the figures indicate that wisepc j1405@xmath15534 has a higher gravity than wisepc j1541@xmath272250 , and we estimate that @xmath86 and 4.0  4.5 for wisepc j1405@xmath15534 and wisepc j1541@xmath272250 , respectively .",
    "these temperatures and gravities , with implied ranges in mass and age , are listed in table 6 .",
    "we have assumed solar metallicity , which for this sample within 10 pc of the sun is plausible .",
    "the comparisons can also be tested against the binary parameters given in table 5 .",
    "the model sequences are consistent with a single - age solution for the three pairs : wise j1217@xmath11626ab , cfbds 1458@xmath11013ab and wise j1711@xmath13500ab .",
    "wise j0458@xmath16434ab appears to be a very similar pair of t9s which we can not constrain .",
    "for all three binaries the models support the older 5  gyr solution and do not support the younger 1  gyr solution , based on agreement with the higher gravity sequences in figure 8 .",
    "the 5  gyr solution for wise j1217@xmath11626 implies @xmath80 and 4.7 for the primary and secondary , respectively ( table 5 ) .",
    "the middle panel of figure 8 shows that the observations are consistent with the @xmath54 ( i.e. relatively thin cloud layers ) @xmath80 and 4.5 sequences , and that @xmath73 is too blue to be consistent with with any lower - gravity solution .",
    "similarly cfbds 1458@xmath11013a constrains the system to the older solution where @xmath80 and 4.6 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "the colors of the secondary are consistent with this , although they do not constrain the solution .",
    "for cfbds 1458@xmath11013a the clouds appear to be very thin to non - existent .",
    "the 5  gyr solution for wise j1711@xmath13500ab has @xmath88 and 4.8 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "wise j1711@xmath13500b constrains the system to this older solution , as @xmath73 is too blue to be consistent with the alternative 1  gyr @xmath89 solution , for any cloud parameter .",
    "wise j1711@xmath13500b also has a thin cloud layer with @xmath90 .",
    "wise j1711@xmath13500a is too warm to constrain the gravity of the system .",
    "the color sequences indicate that wisepc j2056@xmath11459 has @xmath46  450  k , @xmath53 and @xmath76 .",
    "cushing et al .",
    "( 2011 ) present @xmath35-band and @xmath28-band spectra for this y0 dwarf , which we have flux calibrated using our photometry .",
    "figure 9 combines this spectrum with the far - red spectrum obtained here , and compares these spectra to models with @xmath46  k and @xmath53 , with and without clouds .",
    "it can be seen that the cloudy model provides a superior fit in the red and at @xmath17 .",
    "the discrepancy at 1.0  @xmath5 m and 1.5  @xmath5 m , where the cloudy model flux is fainter than observed , can be explained by an overly - strong nh@xmath7 absorption in the models , due to the neglect of vertical mixing ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the mixing enhances n@xmath6 while decreasing the abundance of nh@xmath7 .",
    "this effect can also explain the lack of a strong nh@xmath7 doublet at 1.03 @xmath5 m in figure 1 .",
    "the discrepancy at 1.60  1.65  @xmath5 m , where the model flux is too high , is most likely due to remaining incompleteness in the ch@xmath68 opacity line list ( ch@xmath68 is the dominant opacity at 1.6  @xmath5 m ) .",
    "the color sequences suggest that wisepc j1541@xmath272250 , the coldest dwarf in the sample ( apart from wisepc j1828@xmath12650 , see below ) , has colors approaching those of the cloud - free models ( figures 4 , 7 , 8) . in figure 10",
    "we plot the near - infrared spectrum of this brown dwarf and compare it to a cloud - free model with @xmath91  k and @xmath53 .",
    "the cloudless synthetic spectrum reproduces the 1.0  1.6 @xmath5 m data quite well , with the caveats as before of overly strong nh@xmath7 due to the neglect of mixing .    the fact that a cloudless model fits the spectrum reasonably well despite the fact that water clouds are expected by @xmath92 may not be surprising .",
    "for such a gravity near @xmath93 , the cloud base forms well above the 1 bar level where there is less mass available to condense , compared to still lower effective temperatures where the cloud base is much deeper ( e.g. in jupiter ) .",
    "furthermore , ice crystals or water drops with radii less than about @xmath94 do not interact strongly with near - infrared photons since the relevant mie absorption and scattering efficiencies are very low ( see figure 3 of zsom et al .",
    "2012 for example ) .",
    "when water clouds are found deeper in the atmosphere or form with larger radii we would expect to see a greater effect . in the near - infrared this",
    "would likely first become noticeable in the @xmath30- and @xmath35-bands because of the longer atmospheric pathlength in these opacity windows , and the greater influence of scattering at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "burrows , sudarsky & lunine ( 2003 ) do include water condensates in their models of brown dwarfs with @xmath95  k@xmath66 .",
    "they derive condensate particle sizes of 20 to 150 @xmath5 m , and nevertheless still find that the absorptive opacity of the water clouds is small , such that water ice clouds only have a secondary influence on the spectra of the coolest isolated brown dwarfs .",
    "burrows et al . also calculate that nh@xmath7 clouds form when @xmath96  k , i.e. cooler than the _ wise _ y dwarfs .",
    "further modelling is required to investigate cloud formation for brown dwarfs with @xmath97  k.      wisepc j1828@xmath12650 has the reddest @xmath74 w2 color of any known y dwarf ( @xmath74 w2 @xmath98 ) , and is therefore likely to be the coolest .",
    "cushing et al .",
    "classify this object as y2 .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show that this y2 dwarf is as intrinsically bright in the near - infrared as the y0.5 wisepc j1541@xmath272250 , and is actually brighter in the mid - infrared .",
    "wisepc j1828@xmath12650 is also similar in luminosity to the y0 wisepc j1405@xmath15534 . in order for a cooler brown dwarf to be more luminous than a warmer one ,",
    "the radius must be significantly larger ( @xmath99 is compensated by the factor @xmath100 ) . in this particular case , with an estimated 10% difference in temperature , the radii would need to differ by @xmath101 20% . assuming the rest of the 350  450  k sample has a typical age of a few gyr and @xmath86 ,",
    "then the radius of wisepc j1828@xmath12650 would need to be @xmath102r@xmath23 .",
    "this in turn implies an age younger than 50  myr , and mass smaller than 1 m@xmath12 .",
    "while the young age and low mass are possible , we have explored an alternative solution of binarity for wisepc j1828@xmath12650 . in this scenario , the cooler component would be almost as bright as the warmer component in the mid - infrared , but be significantly fainter in the near - infrared .",
    "we determined solutions that ( i ) reproduced the observed flux when the component fluxes were combined , ( ii ) produced absolute magnitudes generally consistent with our models ( as the distance is known , table 2 ) , and ( iii ) had @xmath18 and @xmath70 parameter pairs consistent with a coeval pair . table 7 gives our synthetically resolved photometry for the components ; the uncertainty is 0.3 magnitudes , constrained by the requirement to reproduce the observed flux .",
    "figure 3 shows the proposed components on spectral type : color diagrams  trends with type are sensible if this brown dwarf is a binary .",
    "figures 4 to 8 show the proposed components on color diagrams . extrapolating from the models and the observed sequences",
    ", the proposed binary appears to consist of a @xmath103  k and @xmath14 primary , and a @xmath15  k and @xmath104 secondary .",
    "these imply a system age of around 2  gyr , and component masses of around 10 and 7 m@xmath12 .",
    "300  k brown dwarfs appear to be significantly brighter than the cloud - free models in the @xmath17 and w2 bands ( figures 4 , 5 and 10 ) , a discrepancy to be addressed by the next generation of models .",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 , or a subset , for the six objects discovered in the _ wise _ database that have been identified as y dwarfs by cushing et al .",
    "we find large differences of 0.5  1.0 magnitudes between our mko - system magnitudes and those published by cushing et al . and kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for three of the brown dwarfs at @xmath35 or @xmath28 .",
    "as our photometry is consistent with the seds published by cushing et al . and",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "we suspect that the previously published palomar wirc photometry is in error for these three objects at those particular wavebands .",
    "our results are otherwise consistent with the previously published data , where they overlap .",
    "we have also obtained a far - red spectrum of the y0 dwarf wisepc j2056@xmath11459 , which has @xmath39  k. the spectrum shows that the cs i lines seen in the 500  k brown dwarf ugps j0722@xmath270540 ( leggett et al .",
    "2012 ) are not seen in this cooler object .",
    "this is not unexpected , as at these temperatures cs should exist predominantly in the form of cscl ( lodders 1999 ) .",
    "we confirm here that new models which include clouds of cr , mns , na@xmath6s , zns and kcl condensates reproduce the near - infrared colors of the latest - type t dwarfs , and the earliest - type y dwarfs , quite well , as previously shown by morley et al .",
    "the @xmath72:@xmath74 w2 and @xmath73:@xmath74 w2 color - color diagrams can be used to estimate @xmath18 , @xmath70 and sedimentation efficiency @xmath45 for the earliest y dwarfs ( figure 8) .",
    "we find that wisep j0410 + 1502 , wisep j1738@xmath12732 and wisepc j2056@xmath11459 have @xmath39  450  k , @xmath86 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also find that wisepc j1405@xmath15534 and wisepc j1541@xmath272250 are cooler than currently covered by the cloudy models , with @xmath87  k and 300  350  k and @xmath86 and 4.0  4.5 , respectively .",
    "we find that the 1.0  1.6 @xmath5 m spectrum of wisepc j1541@xmath272250 can be reproduced quite well with a cloud - free @xmath91  k @xmath53 model , which is somewhat surprising , as water clouds would be expected to form in such cool atmospheres .",
    "the lack of a strong cloud signature may be due to the fact that the cloud base for these relatively low - gravity dwarfs lies high in the atmosphere , and small droplets have low absorption and scattering efficiencies .",
    "improved water cloud models are clearly required .    the temperatures and gravities of the five y0 ",
    "y0.5 dwarfs imply a mass range of 5  15 m@xmath12 and an age around 5  gyr .",
    "we determine similar ages for three binary systems composed of late - t and early - y dwarfs ( liu et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) . in each case comparison to model sequences indicates a value of @xmath70 which corresponds to an age around 5 gyr . the t9 ",
    "y0 components of the three binaries  wise j1217@xmath11626a and b , cfbds 1458@xmath11013a and b , and wise j1711@xmath13500b  appear to have thinner clouds than the y0 dwarfs wisep j0410 + 1502 , wisep j1738@xmath12732 and wisepc j2056@xmath11459 : @xmath90 compared to @xmath11 .",
    "we have found that vertical mixing is likely to be important in the atmospheres of the early - type 400  k y dwarfs , as it is in the atmospheres of t dwarfs , and indeed as it is for jupiter ( e.g. noll , geballe & marley 1997 , leggett et al .",
    "2002 , geballe et al .",
    "the mixing enhances the abundance of n@xmath6 at the expense of nh@xmath7 , explaining the lack of detection of what would otherwise be strong nh@xmath7 absorption at 1.03 @xmath5 m and 1.52 @xmath5 m ( figures 1 , 9 , 10 ) .",
    "the object wisepc j1828@xmath12650 is peculiar . assuming that the parallax for wisepc j1828@xmath12650 is not in error , its luminosity is not consistent with its colors , unless it is younger than around 50 myr .",
    "a more plausible solution may be that wisepc j1828@xmath12650 is a binary system .",
    "we find that a @xmath103  k and @xmath14 primary , and a @xmath15  k and @xmath104 secondary , would follow the observational trends seen with type , absolute magnitude and color ( figures 3 to 8) .",
    "the brightness and colors of the proposed components are also consistent with the cloud - free models , with the exception that the model fluxes at @xmath17 and w2 are too faint by 0.5  1.0 magnitudes .    in future work",
    "we will incorporate water clouds into the models , as well as mixing .",
    "the atmospheres of these 300  500 k objects are extremely complex , but nevertheless the models , which now include chloride and sulfide clouds , have allowed us to estimate temperature and gravity , and hence mass and age , for these exciting _ wise _ discoveries .",

    "<S> we find that the five y0 to y0.5 dwarfs have @xmath8  k@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> these temperatures and gravities imply a mass range of 5  15 m@xmath12 and ages around 5  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that wisep j182831.08@xmath1265037.8 is a binary system , as this better explains its luminosity and color . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the data can be made consistent with observed trends , and generally consistent with the models , if the system is composed of a @xmath13  k and @xmath14 primary , and a @xmath15  k and @xmath16 secondary , corresponding to masses of 10 and 7 m@xmath12 and an age around 2  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> if our deconvolution is correct , then the @xmath15  k cloud - free model fluxes at @xmath17 and w2 are too faint by 0.5  1.0 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we will address this discrepancy in our next generation of models , which will incorporate water clouds and mixing . </S>"
