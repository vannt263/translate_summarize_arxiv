    "excluding extremely large multiplicities ( degeneracies ) of energy eigenvalues , it follows that the time average @xmath86 is negligibly small and hence @xcite that @xmath73 itself must be negligibly small for the overwhelming majority of all sufficiently large @xmath57 , symbolically indicated as @xmath87 note that there still exist arbitrarily large exceptional @xmath57 s owing to the quasi - periodicity of @xmath50 implied by ( [ 90 ] ) .",
    "we also emphasize that our main result ( [ 140 ] ) itself admits arbitrary degeneracies of @xmath1 .    as an example",
    ", we focus on the microcanonical setup introduced below equation ( [ 10 ] ) and on not too large times , so that ( [ 90 ] ) is well approximated by @xmath88 where @xmath89 represents the ( smoothened and normalized ) density of energy levels @xmath2 in the vicinity of the reference energy @xmath90 .",

    "one recovers ( [ 190 ] ) and for @xmath107 one obtains @xmath108      equations ( [ 140 ] ) and ( [ 170 ] ) imply thermalization in the sense that the expectation value @xmath29 becomes ( for most @xmath26 ) practically indistinguishable from the microcanonical average @xmath67 for the overwhelming majority of all sufficiently large @xmath57 .",
    "exceptional @xmath57 s are , for instance , due to quantum revivals , which , in turn , are apparently closely related to the quasi - periodicities of @xmath73 .",
    "our assumption that energy eigenvalues must not be extremely highly degenerate ( see above equation ( [ 170 ] ) ) is similar to refs . @xcite but considerably weaker than the corresponding premises in most other related works @xcite .",
    "the usual time inversion invariance on the fundamental , microscopic level @xcite is maintained by ( [ 140 ] ) due to ( [ 160 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , and in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics , the latter symmetry persists even if it is broken in the microscopic quantum dynamics , e.g. , by an external magnetic field !    by propagating @xmath23 backward in time ( with respect to one particular @xmath26 ) and taking the result as new initial state , one may easily tailor @xcite examples of the very rare @xmath26 s and @xmath57 s which notably deviate from the typical behavior ( [ 140 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , one may back - propagate @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 ( heisenberg picture ) .",
    "note that @xmath109 and @xmath110 were introduced below equation ( [ 190 ] ) not in the sense of associating some entropy and temperature to the non - equilibrium states @xmath28 , but rather as a convenient level - counting tool .",
    "however , we now can identify them _ a posteriori _ with the pertinent entropy and temperature after thermalization .",
    "the randomization via @xmath26 ( see section `` analytical results '' ) can be viewed in two ways : either one considers @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and the spectrum of @xmath1 as arbitrary but fixed , while the eigenbasis of @xmath1 is sampled from a uniform distribution ( haar measure ) . or one considers @xmath1 and the spectra of @xmath23 and @xmath22 as arbitrary but fixed and randomizes the eigenvectors of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in doing so ,",
    "a key point is that the relative orientation of the eigenbases of @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be chosen arbitrarily but then is kept fixed .",
    "indeed , it is well known @xcite that for `` most '' such orientations the expectation values @xmath25 and @xmath67 are practically indistinguishable , i.e. , an initial @xmath25 far from equilibrium requires a careful fine - tuning of @xmath23 relatively to @xmath22 .    in reality , there is usually nothing random in the actual physical systems one has in mind .",
    "hence , results like ( [ 140 ] ) , which ( approximately ) apply to the overwhelming majority of unitaries @xmath26 , should be physically interpreted according to the common lore of random matrix theory @xcite , namely as to apply practically for sure to a concrete system under consideration , unless there are particular reasons to the contrary .",
    "such reasons arise , for instance , when @xmath22 is known to be a conserved quantity , implying a common eigenbasis of @xmath22 and @xmath1 , i.e. , the basis transformations @xmath26 must indeed be very special . furthermore , this non - typicality is structurally stable against sufficiently small perturbations of @xmath22 and/or @xmath1 so that the eigenvectors remain `` almost aligned '' ( each eigenvector of @xmath22 mainly overlaps with one or a few eigenvectors of @xmath1 ) and hence @xmath22 remains `` almost conserved '' ( almost commuting with @xmath1 ) .",
    "analogous non - typical @xmath26 s are expected when @xmath23 is known to be ( almost ) conserved ( commuting with @xmath1 ) .",
    "further well - known exceptions are integrable systems , for which thermalization in the above sense may be absent for certain @xmath23 and @xmath22 @xcite ( but not for others @xcite ) , systems exhibiting many - body localization @xcite , or trivial cases with non - interacting subsystems ( see also supplementary note 2 ) .",
    "our present focus is different : taking thermalization for granted , is the temporal relaxation well approximated by equation ( [ 140 ] ) ?",
    "equation ( [ 210 ] ) is governed by the boltzmann time @xmath0 , amounting to @xmath111s at room temperature .",
    "equation ( [ 200 ] ) gives rise to comparably short time scales , unless the temperature is exceedingly low or the energy window @xmath17 is unusually small .",
    "such relaxation times are much shorter than commonly observed in real systems @xcite . moreover , the temporal decay is typically non - exponential ( see e.g. ( [ 190])-([210 ] ) ) , again in contrast to the usual findings .",
    "this seems to imply that typical experiments correspond to non - typical unitaries @xmath26 .",
    "plausible explanations are as follows : to begin with , the above predicted typical relaxation times are so short that they simply could not be observed in most experiments .",
    "second ( or as a consequence ) , the usual initial conditions and/or observables are indeed quite `` special '' with respect to the prominent role of almost conserved quantities ( see previous section ) , in particular `` local descendants '' of globally conserved quantities like energy , charge , particle numbers , etc .",
    ": examples are the amount of energy , charge etc . within some subdomain of the total system , or , more generally , local densities , whose content within a given volume can only change via transport currents through the boundaries of that volume . as a consequence ,",
    "the global relaxation process becomes `` unusually slow '' if the densities between macroscopically separated places need to equilibrate ( small surface - to - volume ratio ) , or if there exists a natural `` bottleneck '' for their exchange ( weakly interacting subsystems ) .",
    "put differently , our present theory is meant to describe the very rapid relaxation towards local equilibrium , but not any subsequent global equilibration . only if there exists a clear - cut time - scale separation between these two relaxation steps ( or if there is no second step at all ) can we hope to quantitatively capture the first step by our results .",
    "conversely , the time scale - separation usually admits some markovian approximation for the second step , yielding an exponential decay , whose time scale still depends on many details of the system .",
    "natural further generalizations include the closely related concepts of hindered equilibrium , quasi - equilibrium ( metastability ) , and , above all , prethermalization @xcite , referring , e.g. , to a fast partial thermalization within a certain subset of modes , ( quasi-)particles , or other generalized degrees of freedom .",
    "( like in @xcite , we do not adopt here the additional requirement @xcite that the almost conserved quantities originate from a weak perturbation of an integrable system . )    in short , our working hypothesis is that the theory ( [ 140 ] ) describes the temporal relaxation of @xmath29 for any given pair @xmath112 unless one of them is exceptionally close to or in some other way slowed down by an ( almost ) conserved quantity .",
    "we focus on experiments in closed many - body systems in accordance with the above general requirements . in comparing them with our theory ( [ 140 ] ) , we furthermore assume that the ( pre-)thermalized system occupies a microcanonical energy window with some ( effective ) temperature @xmath110 and @xmath107 , so that ( [ 210 ] ) applies .",
    "finally , the asymptotic values @xmath25 and @xmath67 in ( [ 140 ] ) are either obvious or will be estimated from the measurements , hence no further knowledge about the often quite involved details of the experimental observables will be needed !    = 1.0    fig .",

    "the latter value seem quite optimistic to us .",
    "a second `` excuse '' for our slightly larger fwhm value of @xmath113fs is that the tails of the experimental pulse shape may be considerably broader than those of a gaussian with the same fwhm ( see , e.g. , fig .",

    "this note provides a brief account of those previous analytical findings which exhibit some appreciable similarity to ours .    ref . [ 1 ] ( see supplementary references ) considers the convergence ( for most times ) towards some steady state , which is in general different from the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "furthermore , the focus is either on two - outcome measurements , where one of the projectors is of low rank , or the initial state must be an eigenvector of the considered observable .",
    "finally , a role more or less similar to our present randomization via @xmath26 is played by the assumption that the initial state must be spread over very many energy levels . within this setting , general upper bounds are obtained for some suitably defined equilibration time scale ( as opposed to the ( approximate ) equality ( 13 ) for the entire temporal behavior ) .",
    "apart from these quite significant differences , the essential conclusions are analogous to ours , namely an extremely rapid relaxation for all above mentioned two - outcome measurements of low rank , as well as for most observables if the initial state is an eigenvector of the observable .",
    "[ 2 ] focuses on subsystem - plus - bath compounds , the total hilbert space being a collection of many smaller units ( e.g. due to a local hamiltonian on a lattice ) , and on separable initial states . under these premises , upper bounds for the subsystem s temporal relaxation",
    "are derived , which exhibit some ( limited ) similarities to our present findings , including the prediction of typically very fast relaxation processes .    under the additional assumptions that in the latter setup the subsystem is a single qubit , the initial state of the qubit as well as the considered observable are given by pauli matrices ( or the identity ) , and the environment is in a pure initial state , similar findings as in our present work have been obtained in ref .",
    "note that those initial states of the qubit are not very physical and that their linear superposition is not admitted in the findings of [ 3 ] due to the non - linearity of the problem .",
    "[ 4,5 ] focus on macroscopic observables with a concomitant projector @xmath291 onto a very small subspace of the `` energy shell '' @xmath4 so that any ( normalized ) state @xmath292 with @xmath293 represents thermal equilibrium . denoting , similarly as in our present approach , by @xmath26 the transformation between the bases of the `` observable '' @xmath291 and the hamiltonian @xmath1 , it is then shown that most @xmath26 result in an extremely quick thermalization for any initial pure state @xmath294 .",
    "similarly as in [ 1 ] ( see above ) , this conclusion is based on an upper ( but arguably rather tight ) estimate for the actual temporal relaxation and on similar assumptions about the energy level density @xmath89 as in equations ( 17)-(20 ) .    in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] it is shown that the vast majority of all pure states featuring a common expectation value of some generic observable at a given time will yield very similar expectation values of the same observable at any later time . while in our present approach , @xmath23 and @xmath22 are kept fixed relatively to each other and @xmath26 randomizes their constellation relatively to the hamiltonian @xmath1 , in ref .",
    "[ 6 ] the pair @xmath22 and @xmath1 is kept fixed , while @xmath23 is randomly sampled under the additional constraint that it is a pure state with a preset ( arbitrary but fixed ) expectation value @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , no quantitative statements about how @xmath29 actually evolves in time have been obtained in [ 6 ] .    ref . [ 7 ] suggests fairly rough relaxation time estimates by exploiting three quite drastic _ a priori _ assumptions .",
    "one of them postulates that the relaxation is monotonous in time , which can in fact not be generally true , see equation ( 19 ) and fig .",
    "6 . apart from that ,",
    "the obtained estimates are roughly comparable to ours .",
    "this note compiles some additional remarks and extensions , ordered according to their appearance in the main text .      \\1 . in the present paper",
    ", we mainly have in mind the examples mentioned below equation ( 1 ) , i.e. , @xmath4 represents some microcanonical `` energy shell '' of a closed many - body system . but",
    "similarly as in refs .",
    "[ 8 - 10 ] , our main result ( 13 ) is actually valid for the more general setup outlined above equation ( 1 ) , i.e. , @xmath4 may also represent a more abstract type of `` active hilbert space '' .",
    "for instance , this may be of interest for autonomous systems with few degrees of freedom in the context of semiclassical chaos when the initial state is `` spread '' over many energy levels .",
    "\\2 . _ a priori _ ,",
    "the pertinent hilbert space of a many - body system is not a microcanonical energy shell @xmath4 , nor are the hamiltonian , observables , and system states given by hermitian operators @xmath1 , @xmath22 , and @xmath28 on @xmath4 right from the beginning .",
    "rather , the system originally `` lives '' in a much larger hilbert space @xmath295 and the hamiltonian , observables , and system states are given by hermitian operators @xmath296 , @xmath297 , and @xmath298 on @xmath295 .",
    "how to go over from the original ( primed ) to the reduced ( unprimed ) setup is not very difficult [ 11 - 15 ] , but also not entirely obvious :    similarly as in the main text , we denote by @xmath2 and @xmath3 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath296 , where @xmath34 runs from @xmath190 to infinity or to some finite upper limit ( dimension of @xmath295 ) .",
    "likewise , the corresponding matrix elements of @xmath298 are denoted as @xmath299 .",
    "the key point consist in our assumption below equation ( 1 ) that the system exhibit a well defined macroscopic energy , i.e. , there exists a microcanonical energy window @xmath300 $ ] so that the level populations @xmath301 are negligibly small for energies @xmath2 outside the interval @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , we can an will assume that the labels @xmath34 and the integer @xmath19 are chosen so that @xmath302 .",
    "next , we denote by @xmath4 the subspace spanned by @xmath303 , by @xmath304 the projector onto @xmath4 , and by @xmath305 , @xmath306 , @xmath307 the corresponding `` restrictions '' or `` projections '' of the original operators . with @xmath308 ( cauchy - schwarz inequality ) and the above approximation @xmath309 for @xmath310 , it follows that @xmath311 if @xmath312 or @xmath310 and hence that @xmath313 . since @xmath155 commutes with @xmath296 and thus with @xmath314 , the original time evolution @xmath315 implies that @xmath316 for all @xmath57 , and with @xmath317 it follows that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . exploiting the cyclic invariance of the trace and @xmath317 finally yields @xmath318 for all @xmath57 .",
    "so far , the basic operators @xmath1 , @xmath22 , @xmath28 and their descendants @xmath319 and @xmath320 are strictly speaking still defined on @xmath295 but it is trivial to reinterpret them as being defined on @xmath4 . in particular , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath321",
    "are now given by @xmath322 and @xmath323 , respectively . while the connection between @xmath1 and @xmath296 and between @xmath28 and @xmath298 is thus rather trivial , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath22 are in general quite different from those of @xmath297 .",
    "nevertheless , all original ( primed ) expectation values are correctly recovered within the reduced ( unprimed ) formalism .",
    "a natural intuitive guess is that @xmath324 and @xmath325 should be essentially independent of each other in the sense that @xmath326_{u}}$ ] can be approximated by @xmath327_{u}}{\\left[}a_{nn}{\\right]_{u}}$ ] .",
    "if so , one could readily conclude from equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) that @xmath328 , which is nothing else than the leading order approximation of equation ( 9 ) .",
    "in other words , our guess seems right , the essence of equation ( 9 ) is intuitively quite obvious , and the last term in equation ( 9 ) must be due to weak correlations between @xmath324 and @xmath325 for non - equilibrium initial conditions @xmath25 .      \\4 .",
    "the essential prerequisite in approximating equation ( 8) by ( 17 ) is that @xmath329 must be much smaller than the inverse mean level distance .",
    "since the energy levels are extremely dense for typical many - body systems , the approximation applies for all experimentally realistic times @xmath57 .",
    "however , the quasi - periodicities of @xmath73 for extremely large @xmath57 , inherited from @xmath50 via ( 7 ) and ( 8) , usually get lost .",
    "\\5 . by similar methods as in the derivation of our main result ( 13 )",
    ", one can show [ 11 ] that for the overwhelming majority of unitaries @xmath26 the diagonal matrix elements @xmath325 remain very close to their mean value @xmath330_{u}}=\\langle a\\rangle_{\\!{\\rho_{\\mathrm{mc}}}}$ ] , a property also known under the name eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) [ 12 - 14 ] .",
    "it is tempting to argue that a violation of eth indicates an `` untypical '' case and hence also ( 13 ) will be violated .",
    "however , there is no reason why the extremely small subset of @xmath26 s which violate ( 13 ) has any relevant overlap with the extremely small subset of @xmath26 s which violate eth .",
    "in other words , we expect that equation ( 13 ) still applies to the vast majority of eth - violating systems , i.e. , provided their initial condition @xmath23 is still sufficiently `` typical '' to guarantee thermalization .",
    "numerical examples of such cases are provided , e.g. , by ref . [",
    "vice versa , the findings about typicality of eth and thermalization from [ 11,12,16 - 19 ] are expected to remain valid even when ( 13 ) is violated ( thus including cases which do not thermalize as rapidly as predicted by ( 13 ) ) .",
    "an analogous consideration applies to the `` level populations '' @xmath324 : they must be negligible outside the microcanonical energy window @xmath16 $ ] , but inside the window they may still be distributed quite `` untypically '' .",
    "more abstractly speaking , in order to realize simultaneously an untypical @xmath26 and a far from equilibrium @xmath25 , one generally expects that the eigenbases of both @xmath22 and @xmath23 must be fine - tuned relatively to a given @xmath1 .    as a consequence ,",
    "one expects untypically strong correlations between @xmath325 and @xmath324 ( see also paragraph 3 .",
    "this is confirmed , e.g. , by the numerical examples in refs .",
    "[ 14,20 ] and is also closely related to the ideas proposed by peres in ref .",
    "[ 21 ] .",
    "\\7 . to further scrutinize the untypical @xmath26 s , we consider subsets @xmath331 consisting of all @xmath26 s with the extra property that @xmath332 , where @xmath41 is defined below equation ( 3 ) .",
    "one readily sees that for any given @xmath333-value , the set @xmath331 still entails the necessary symmetries so that equations ( 2)-(8 ) remain valid when re - defining @xmath32_{u}}$ ] as the restricted average over all @xmath334 . on the other hand ,",
    "equation ( 9 ) is replaced by @xmath335 , implied by @xmath332 for all @xmath334 .",
    "finally , one expects , analogously as in equations ( 10)-(12 ) , that the fluctuations about the average behavior are typically small for most @xmath336 .",
    "while a rigorous proof seems very difficult , the intuitive argument is that the subset @xmath331 can be represented as a manifold of fantastically large dimensionality ( just one dimension less that for the unrestricted set of all @xmath26 s due to the extra constraint @xmath332 ) .",
    "hence , a similar concentration of measure phenomenon is expected in both cases .",
    "analogously as in ( 13 ) , the overall conclusion is that @xmath337 should be satisfied in very good approximation for the vast majority of all times @xmath57 and unitaries @xmath334 .",
    "upon comparison with ( 13 ) one sees that if @xmath333 notably differs from @xmath67 then most @xmath334 are untypical . on the other hand ,",
    "any given untypical @xmath26 is contained in one of the subsets @xmath331 and is thus generically expected to satisfy the above approximation . remarkably , the time dependence is governed by the same function @xmath73 for all @xmath333 .",
    "these considerations justify our comparison of the theory ( in the above generalized version ) with the integrable model in fig .",

    "<S> a second recent key result is due to goldstein , hara , and tasaki @xcite , demonstrating that most systems closely approach an overwhelmingly large , so - called equilibrium hilbert - subspace on the extremely short boltzmann time scale @xmath0 . a more detailed account of pertinent previous works is provided as supplementary note 1 .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we will further extend these findings in two essential respects : instead of upper bounds for some suitably defined characteristic time scale , as in @xcite , the entire temporal relaxation will be approximated in the form of an equality . </S>",
    "<S> as an even more decisive generalization of @xcite , we will admit largely arbitrary observables . </S>",
    "<S> finally , and actually for the first time within the realm of the above mentioned analytical approaches @xcite , we will compare our predictions with various experimental as well as numerical data from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , most of those data have not been quantitatively explained by any other analytical theory before . adopting a `` typicality approach '' similar in spirit to random matrix theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , our result covers the vast majority ( in a suitably defined mathematical sense ) of initial conditions , observables , and system hamiltonians . on the other hand , many commonly considered observables and initial conditions actually seem to be rather special in that they are close to or governed by a hidden conserved quantity and therefore thermalize `` untypically slowly '' . </S>"
