    "observations of the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission give information about the galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , the interstellar gas and diffuse photon fields , and about the interactions between them .",
    "the observational results obtained with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the compton gamma ray observatory can be described fairly well by a suitable model for the diffuse interstellar gas , cosmic ray ( cr ) and photon distributions ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "1997a ; hunter et al .",
    "1997b ) .",
    "however , above 1  gev the observed average diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity in the inner galaxy , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , exceeds the model prediction significantly .",
    "there are at least two possible explanations for this discrepancy ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "1997b ; weekes et al .",
    "the high - energy @xmath0-ray excess may indicate that the gcr spectrum observed in the local neighborhood is not representative of the diffuse cr population in the galactic disk ; a harder average diffuse proton spectrum is required to explain the @xmath0-ray excess if it is due to @xmath2-decay .",
    "an unresolved distribution of cr sources is the other possibility .    the physical picture which we consider in this paper corresponds to the second possibility .",
    "the idea that crs , after leaving their sources , could in principle produce @xmath0-rays in ambient dense clouds with a harder spectrum than those produced by the average gcrs , was proposed by aharonian and atoyan ( 1996 ) .",
    "another proposed possibility , also invoking transport effects , is the local hardening of the cr energy spectrum in the direction perpendicular to the galactic disk above strong cr sources , especially above the inner region of the galaxy , due to faster cr convection in a faster galactic wind ( vlk 1999 ) .",
    "this contributes a principally observable harder than average @xmath0-ray component in such regions .",
    "in contrast , we consider here the accelerating particles inside their sources , where they are much more strongly scattered than in the ism , neglecting the contributions invoked by aharonian and atoyan , and by vlk ( see also below ) .",
    "we assume that snrs are the dominant sources of the galactic crs . on this premise",
    "we find that crs , accelerated and confined in snrs , give an important contribution to the high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic disk . since the cr energy spectrum inside snrs is much harder than on average in the galaxy",
    " the average spectrum being softened by rigidity - dependent escape from the galaxy in the diffusion region above the disk  the relative snr contribution increases with energy and becomes in fact dominant at @xmath0-ray energies @xmath5  gev .",
    "it may substantially increase the diffuse tev @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic disk so as to constitute a significant and spatially variable observational background which must also be taken into account in the search for spatially extended galactic cr sources in this energy region .",
    "a physically analogous problem is the contribution of cr electrons in snrs to the _ radio synchrotron spectrum _ of normal galaxies , without an active galactic nucleus .",
    "it has been recently discussed by lisenfeld & vlk ( 1999 ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall investigate pion - decay @xmath0-ray emission from cr nuclei as well as inverse compton ( ic ) radiation and bremsstrahlung due to cr electrons .",
    "it will be shown that the average ic @xmath0-ray background from snrs is comparable in magnitude and spectral form to the pion - decay background at high energies , whereas the corresponding bremsstrahlung component is negligible .",
    "the majority of the gcrs , at least up to kinetic energies @xmath6  ev , is presumably accelerated in snrs . according to modern theory a significant part of the hydrodynamic supernova ( sn ) explosion energy @xmath7  erg",
    "is converted into crs already in the early sedov phase of the evolution , due to diffusive shock acceleration ( e.g. berezhko et al . 1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "later on , the cr energy content and the high - energy @xmath0-ray production slowly decrease with time .",
    "this is at least true as long as the progenitor star is not so massive as to have a strong wind which significantly modifies the circumstellar medium ( berezhko & vlk , 2000 ) .",
    "the total number of snrs @xmath8 is an increasing function of their assumed life time @xmath9 , i.e. the time until which they can confine the accelerated particles ; here @xmath10 is the galactic sn rate .",
    "therefore we conclude that the population of the oldest snrs dominates the total @xmath0-ray luminosity of the ensemble of galactic snrs .",
    "thus we consider only old snrs which nevertheless are still strong enough to confine most of the crs produced during the prior evolutionary stages .",
    "we then have the situation that the crs in the galaxy are represented by two basically different populations .",
    "the first one consists of the ordinary gcrs and presumably occupies a large galactic residence volume quasi - uniformly .",
    "this residence volume exceeds that occupied by the cr sources by far ( e.g. ptuskin et al .",
    "1997 ; for an earlier review , see berezinsky et al .",
    "1990 ) . the second cr population , which we call source cosmic rays ( scrs ) ,",
    "is represented by shock accelerated crs that are still confined in the localized snrs . during the initial , active period of snr evolution of",
    "about @xmath11  yr when the sn shock is relatively strong , the volume occupied by the accelerated crs practically coincides with the shock volume . in later stages",
    "the shock becomes weak and crs begin to leave the snr acceleration region .",
    "after some period of time @xmath9 the escaping scrs become very well mixed with the `` sea '' of gcrs .",
    "we shall assume that the transitory period during which scrs are transformed into gcrs is much shorter than the preceding confinement time @xmath9 .",
    "the most important factor for cr confinement is the shock strength . even in the phase where radiative cooling would formally become important ,",
    "this remains true since crs prevent cooling compression due to their pressure .",
    "thus the assumed mean life time @xmath12  yr is determined by the shock dynamics more than by anything else .    since the @xmath0-ray production due to gcrs is quite well studied ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "1997b ; mori 1997 ) , it is primarily important to find the relative contribution of the scr population .",
    "the production rate of @xmath2-decay @xmath0-rays from inelastic cr - gas collisions , primarily p - p collisions , may be written in the form ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the local gas number density , @xmath15 is the inelastic p - p cross - section , @xmath16 is the so - called spectrum - weighted moment of the inelastic cross - section , @xmath17 is the cr spatial number density of crs in the kinetic energy interval @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the speed of light .",
    "thus we have to primarily calculate @xmath20 for the two cr populations .    the quasi - uniform gcr population in the gas disk is assumed to have roughly a power law spectrum in the relativistic range @xmath21 the total number @xmath22 of relativistic gcrs with @xmath23 , per unit volume , can be expressed in terms of the cr energy density @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the proton mass . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our consideration here to the proton component which is energetically dominant in both the gcr and the scr populations .",
    "in contrast to the gcr population , the scrs are confined inside a discrete number @xmath27 of snrs .",
    "these are assumed to be predominantly located in the galactic gas disk , of volume @xmath28 .",
    "spatially averaged over the galactic disk volume their @xmath0- ray production rate is determined by an expression analogous to eq . ( 1 ) , where instead of @xmath20 one should substitute the scr distribution @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the overall ( i.e. integrated over the snr volume ) scr number in the energy interval @xmath18 , and should use an appropriate mean local interstellar medium ( ism ) number density @xmath31 into which the sne explode .",
    "since the crs produced inside snrs have also a power - law spectrum @xmath32 in the relativistic range , @xmath33 can be expressed in the same forms ( 2 ) and(3 ) , with @xmath34 and putting @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the fraction of the sn explosion energy @xmath37 converted into scrs .",
    "however , according to the prediction from nonlinear kinetic theory ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) , diffusive shock acceleration produces an extremely hard spectrum of scrs at the early sedov phase which is characterized by a power law index @xmath38 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the maximum scr energy .    for the ratio @xmath41 of the @xmath0-ray production rates due to scrs and gcrs , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ratio @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the average gas density in the disk .",
    "in fact we assume that the gas and the crs are distributed uniformly inside each snr which is approximately true for the old snrs which we consider here .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 describes a possible spatial correlation between sn occurrence and local ism density .",
    "if on average supernovae explode in a denser than average medium in the galactic disk , then @xmath46 , whereas @xmath47 in the opposite case .    the main mass of the ism @xmath48 is contained in a galactic disk region of a thickness of about 240  pc , corresponding to the thickness of the hi gas ( dickey and lockman 1990 ) which has the volume @xmath49  @xmath50 referred to before . here",
    "we take a disk radius of about @xmath51 kpc which implies an average gas density @xmath52 . taking the relativistic part of the gcr spectrum to be characterized by @xmath53  erg/@xmath50 , and @xmath54 which results in @xmath55 ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) , we obtain for the standard set of sn parameters @xmath56  erg , @xmath57  yr@xmath58 : @xmath59 in addition using the rather moderate parameter values @xmath60 and @xmath61 to characterize cr acceleration inside snrs ( e.g. berezhko et al . 1996 ) .",
    "one can see from this expression that for @xmath62  yr the @xmath0 ray production due to scrs becomes dominant already at energies @xmath63  gev .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath64 represents the ratio of currently existing total scr energy and gcr energy inside @xmath28 . for the above set of parameters it is about 0.1 .",
    "despite the fact that the scrs represent only a relatively small fraction of the total cr energy content even in the disk , they may dominate the @xmath0-ray production at sufficiently high energies due to their much harder spectrum .",
    "it is clear that the quantity @xmath65 determines the average ratio + @xmath66 of @xmath0-ray spectra produced in any region of the disk , by scrs and gcrs , respectively .",
    "therefore the total @xmath0-ray spectrum measured from an arbitrary galactic disk volume is expected to be @xmath67,\\ ] ] where the additional factor 0.4 is introduced to approximately take into account the contribution of gcr electron component to the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission at gev energies ( e.g. hunter et al .",
    "in fig.1 we present the expected differential flux of @xmath0-rays from the inner galaxy , calculated for @xmath68 and @xmath69  yr , with the spectrum @xmath70 taken from the paper by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , and extended into the region @xmath71  gev according to the law @xmath72 .",
    "one can see that after inclusion of the @xmath0-rays produced by scrs , the calculated flux even exceeds the egret flux for @xmath73  gev .",
    "this suggests that expression ( 7 ) overestimates the @xmath0-ray production by scrs .",
    "it is possible that the overall source spectral index @xmath74 is somewhat larger than 2 due to very late accumulation of only low - energy particles .",
    "it can also not be excluded that the confinement time @xmath9 of the scrs depends on energy . due to their high mobility",
    ", the highest energy particles may leave the vicinity of parent snr earlier and also more rapidly .",
    "this process of scr escape into the ism starts for the most energetic particles already at the early sedov phase of snr evolution ( e.g. berezhko et al . 1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) .",
    "therefore at time @xmath9 , when the main part of scrs are released from the snr , their spectrum may be somewhat steeper than a @xmath38 spectrum .",
    "due to the importance of the problem we derive the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath76 in a different form .",
    "it leads to the same results if snrs are the gcr source .",
    "we start from the usual leaky box balance equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the energy - dependent residence volume occupied by gcrs that reach the gas disk during their mean residence time @xmath79 in @xmath80 . in the case of an extended galactic halo due to a galactic wind driven by the gcrs themselves , and for energies much larger than a few gev , @xmath80 can be much greater than @xmath28 .",
    "in fact @xmath81 in such a selfconsistent halo model ( ptuskin at al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "note that the leaky box model deals with a cr distribution @xmath82 averaged over the residence volume @xmath80 . therefore it can only be applied to the gcrs which can be assumed to be almost uniformly distributed in the residence volume .",
    "it is not valid for the scrs , because their behavior is determined not only by large - scale transport but also by other physical factors which , for example , lead to their acceleration .",
    "technically the volume @xmath83 , occupied by the scrs , should be excluded from the residence volume @xmath80 and the scrs appear in the balance equation ( 10 ) for the gcrs only in the form of a source term @xmath84 as a cr population released from the source region into the ism after some unspecified evolutionary period @xmath9 .",
    "therefore eq.(10 ) does not depend upon @xmath9 .",
    "however , the effects produced by the scrs confined inside the ensemble of simultaneously existing snrs , for example the additional @xmath0-ray production , essentially depends on @xmath9 , since it directly determines the total number @xmath27 of simultaneously existing snrs .    using eq .",
    "( 4 ) we can write @xmath85 the gcr residence time in the disk volume , @xmath86 , can be derived from the measured grammage @xmath87 , which is the mean mass of interstellar matter traversed by gcrs of speed @xmath88 in the course of their random walk in the galaxy : @xmath89 the measured grammage at high energies @xmath90  gev is + @xmath91  g/@xmath92 ; for @xmath93 , @xmath94  g/@xmath92 ( engelman et al . 1990 ) . therefore the residence time _ in the gas disk _ can be written in the form @xmath95 where @xmath96  yr , @xmath97  gev , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "this experimentally inferred value for @xmath100 closely agrees with the theoretical result of ptuskin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we note that at relativistic energies @xmath101 , according to the initial balance eq.(10 ) , the gcr spectrum @xmath102 and the overall scr spectrum @xmath103 should be connected by the relation @xmath104 for @xmath105 the source should produce a scr spectrum with @xmath106 , while for the case @xmath38 one would need @xmath107 .    at the same time",
    "the scr distribution + @xmath108 , averaged over the gas disk , can have a different shape compared to @xmath109 in the case of an energy dependent snr confinement time @xmath110 , according to eq .",
    "it can be steeper , @xmath111 , if @xmath112 is a decreasing function of energy .",
    "it would mean that the highest energy scrs leave the parent snr faster than the lower energy scrs .",
    "eq.(11 ) leads to a simple expression for the @xmath0-ray production ratio @xmath113 independently of @xmath10 . substituting the residence time in the form ( 13 ) , and taking @xmath106 , which leads to @xmath114 ( drury et al .",
    "1994 ) in eq.(15 ) , we obtain for @xmath115  gev : @xmath116 we shall only consider @xmath0-ray energies @xmath115  gev .",
    "one can see here again that the scr contribution is determined by the value of the confinement time inside snrs , @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately there is no detailed description of when and how crs , accelerated in snr , are released into the ism .",
    "nevertheless one can give some constraints on this process .    according to the standard theory , the expanding snr shock produces a power law cr spectrum up to the maximum energy ( berezhko 1996 ; berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ; berezhko & vlk 1997 ) @xmath117 which is determined by the radius @xmath118 and speed @xmath119 of the shock .",
    "the crs with the highest energy @xmath40 are produced at the very beginning of the sedov phase @xmath120 when the product @xmath121 has its maximum @xmath122 , where @xmath123 are the sweep - up time , sweep - up radius and initial mean ejecta speed respectively ; @xmath124 denotes the ejecta mass , and @xmath125 the ism density .",
    "subsequently , the product @xmath121 decreases with time as @xmath126 and the snr shock produces crs with progressively lower cutoff energy @xmath127 . during that phase those crs that were previously produced with energies",
    "@xmath128 now propagate outward diffusively without significant influence of the snr shock .",
    "if their expansion is still governed by the bohm diffusion coefficient as during their acceleration , the expansion rate is only slightly higher than the snr expansion rate and these particles should be considered as confined inside the source ( i.e. the snr ) .",
    "the opposite extreme case corresponds to the assumption that particles with energies @xmath129 do no more produce a high level of turbulence .",
    "let us consider this pessimistic scenario in terms of confinement here .",
    "in this case the propagation of these very high energy particles is governed by the mean galactic diffusion coefficient which is very much larger than the bohm diffusion coefficient .",
    "in this situation particles with energy @xmath130 should be considered as released from the source at the moment @xmath131 when @xmath132 drops below @xmath130 . since the particles with maximum energy are produced at @xmath133 ,",
    "one can write @xmath134 due to this strong dependence it is clear that @xmath110 will still deviate from the overall gas dynamic life time @xmath135 only for large energies @xmath130 near @xmath40 .",
    "all particles with @xmath136 will remain confined until @xmath135 .",
    "since the majority of galactic sne are core collapse sne from stars with masses exceeding about @xmath137 , we shall use @xmath138 for purposes of estimate .",
    "except for progenitor masses exceeding @xmath139 , the progenitors have only a weak stellar wind .",
    "therefore the assumption of a uniform circumstellar medium remains reasonable for the average properties of the snr population .    for the main fraction of crs the confinement in snrs terminates when the snr shock becomes weak and produces crs with a very steep spectrum that can not anymore excite a high level of turbulence near the shock front .",
    "if we take @xmath140 as a critical mach number , the corresponding snr age will be @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the initial shock mach number and @xmath143 is the ism sound speed . for an ism with number density @xmath144  @xmath145 , @xmath146km / sec , and then @xmath147  yr which gives @xmath148  yr for @xmath149 and @xmath56 erg .",
    "this estimate shows that the snr shock remains rather strong during a very long period of time .",
    "another physical factor which can restrict the scr confinement is the radiative cooling of the postshock gas .",
    "approximately it becomes important when the postshock temperature drops below @xmath150  k , or when the postshock sound speed drops below @xmath151  km / s . in the case of a strong shock , with mach number @xmath152 , the postshock sound speed",
    "is determined by the shock speed @xmath153 . during the sedov phase",
    "the shock speed decreases with time according to the law @xmath154",
    ". therefore the shock speed drops to the value @xmath155  km / s at the age @xmath156 .",
    "the above set of sn and ism parameters gives @xmath157  yr .",
    "since gas clumping as a result of cooling may lead to effective scr leakage from the snr , a value of the confinement time @xmath69  yr is reasonable for @xmath158 .",
    "1 ) .    in fig.1",
    "we present a calculated @xmath0-ray spectrum based on the above expression ( 16 ) with @xmath159 @xmath160  gev , and @xmath161 , which is roughly valid for the hadronic considered @xmath0-ray production process considered . at gev energies in this case scrs contribute about 10% of the total @xmath0-ray flux . due to their hard spectrum",
    "this contribution progressively increases with energy and becomes dominant at @xmath162  gev .",
    "it increases the expected tev @xmath0-ray flux by about a factor of ten .",
    "note that the actual scr contribution from the inner part of the galaxy is somewhat higher than the above estimate due to the larger snr concentration in this region .    as one can see from fig .",
    "1 , the scr contribution in the case @xmath38 , using eqs . ( 8) and ( 9 ) , is for all energies larger than that for @xmath106 , using eq . ( 16 ) .",
    "this difference is related to the different scr acceleration efficiencies . in the first case it is characterized by the parameter @xmath60 which , according to eq . ( 5 ) , directly determines the @xmath0-ray production rate . in the second case the scr acceleration efficiency @xmath163/e_{sn}$ ] is not contained in the final expression ( 15 ) , but one can derive it easily from the balance equation ( 10 ) which gives : @xmath164 to determine @xmath36 we use the ( demodulated ) gcr distribution @xmath165 ( ryan et al .",
    "1972 ; perko 1987 ) .    substituting the values of @xmath166 , @xmath28 , @xmath37 , and @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath167 for the relativistic part of the gcr spectrum .",
    "the required acceleration efficiency is two times lower compared with the case @xmath38 due to the essentially steeper spectrum .",
    "note , that in both cases the scr spectra with @xmath38 , @xmath168 and @xmath106 , @xmath169 contain about the same number of relativistic crs . in the first case",
    "the required gcr residence time is @xmath170 , whereas the second case with @xmath171 is close to the experiment ( engelman et al .",
    "therefore we believe that the dashed line in fig.1 represents the most reliable estimate for the expected diffuse @xmath2-decay @xmath0-ray emission , especially at high energies @xmath162  gev .",
    "note also that the acceleration efficiency required by eq .",
    "( 21 ) , using an assumed galactic sn rate @xmath57  yr@xmath58 and a mean sn explosion energy @xmath172  erg , is considerably lower than that predicted by shock acceleration theory , which gives @xmath173 ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) . yet , in contrast to the acceleration models which determine @xmath36 from the injection rate and the nonlinear acceleration theory selfconsistently , eq .",
    "( 21 ) determines only the product @xmath174 from observed quantities .",
    "the observationally inferred sn explosion energies @xmath37 can be at least by a factor 2 smaller than @xmath175 erg , and from comparisons with galaxies similar to our own @xmath10 could vary between @xmath176  yr@xmath58 .",
    "therefore the empirical value of @xmath36 from eq .",
    "( 21 ) can vary between 0.05 and 1/3 .",
    "nevertheless , the theoretically determined efficiencies appear systematically too high .    as a possible solution for",
    "this discrepancy one might assume that , just before being released , the scrs lose an important part of their energy by adiabatic expansion so that the scrs energy content inside a snr is higher than the energy contained in the released spectrum @xmath109 . however , there is little dynamical basis for such an assumption .",
    "much more likely is that the very efficient cr acceleration inside snrs predicted by the nonlinear kinetic theory , assuming spherical symmetry , takes place in reality only at some fraction of the sn shock surface , because suprathermal positive ion injection into the acceleration process on the highly oblique part of the shock can be significantly suppressed ( bennet & ellison 1995 ; malkov & vlk 1995 ) . in this case the acceleration efficiency , calculated for a spherical snr shock , should be reduced by a factor of a few .",
    "the actual snr distribution can in fact be rather nonuniform within the disk volume , contrary to what we have assumed implicitly up to now . in this case",
    "the estimated value of @xmath65 , which describes the relative scr contribution to the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission , should be corrected by a factor @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the expected number of snrs in the observed region and @xmath27 represents this number in the case of uniformly distributed snrs .",
    "it is clear that the expected value of @xmath65 is almost independent of the actual snr distribution if the observed region is an essential part of the whole disk volume @xmath28 .",
    "electrons , once being injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process , will be as efficiently accelerated in snrs as are the protons . even though there exist theoretical concepts ( e.g. levinson 1994 ; galeev et al .",
    "1995 ; mcclements et al . 1997 ; bykov & uvarov 1999 ) , electron injection is not completely understood . however , there is no doubt that electrons undergo continuous acceleration during snr evolution .",
    "the spectral shape of accelerated electrons @xmath179 inside snrs deduced from radio - observations on average agrees with what is expected from shock acceleration . since relativistic electrons with energies @xmath180  gev are dynamically indistinguishable from protons , their source spectrum @xmath181 can differ from that of the protons @xmath109 only by some energy independent factor @xmath182 that is determined by the injection process .",
    "high energy electrons produce @xmath0-ray emission due to ic scattering , especially on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and by bremsstrahlung on the interstellar gas .",
    "we shall first consider the ic contribution here .      in an approximate form , valid",
    "if the generating electron energy distribution is smoothly varying , like in the case of a power law considered here , the ic @xmath0-ray emissivity @xmath183 can be written as ( e.g. longair 1981 , berezinsky et al .",
    "1990 ) @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the energy of electrons which produce an ic photon with mean energy @xmath186 , @xmath187 denotes the thomson cross section , @xmath188  ev and @xmath189  @xmath145 are the mean energy and number density of the cmb photons , respectively .",
    "finally @xmath190 denotes the average spatial electron scr number density .",
    "thus the ratio of the ic to the @xmath2-decay @xmath0-ray production rate reads as @xmath191 where we have used @xmath38 and @xmath192  @xmath193 ; @xmath194 denotes the number of snrs which contribute to the ic emission at energy @xmath186 from cr electron sources .    from this expression",
    "it appears as if the ic @xmath0-ray contribution would be dominant at tev - energies if @xmath182 is as large as @xmath195 and if the mean gas number density inside snrs is about @xmath196  @xmath145 .",
    "however , the radiative cooling time @xmath197 of electrons , which produce @xmath0-rays with energy @xmath198  tev , @xmath199 reaches the above assumed overall snr confinement time @xmath69  yr for @xmath0-ray energies @xmath200  gev . here",
    "@xmath201 is the magnetic field strength inside the source , whose typical value inside snrs is about 10  @xmath100 g .",
    "therefore , taking into account the obvious relation @xmath202 , on average the relative ic contribution of the electron component of scrs in tev @xmath0-ray can be written as @xmath203 it is independent of the @xmath0-ray energy for @xmath204 , and only given by eq .",

    "this consideration shows that for the parameters assumed , and for @xmath182 of the order of @xmath195 , we have an ic contribution to the average @xmath0-ray background which is comparable to the hadronic background for all energies above a few gev .      at high energies , @xmath207",
    ", we have for the bremsstrahlung @xmath0-ray emissivity @xmath208 @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the minimum electron energy necessary to produce a bremsstrahlung @xmath0-ray of energy @xmath186 , the factor 2 takes into account the contributions of electron - electron and electron - proton collisions , and where the differential electron - proton bremsstrahlung cross - section is given by ( e.g. berezinsky et al . 1990 ) @xmath211 \\left[{\\rm ln}\\left(\\frac{2\\epsilon_e}{mc^2}\\frac{\\epsilon_e-\\epsilon_{\\gamma } } { \\epsilon_{\\gamma}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\right].\\ ] ] here @xmath212 and @xmath213  cm denote the fine structure constant and the classical electron radius , respectively .    for our chosen value @xmath214 , the integral for @xmath215",
    "can be calculated in closed form . in the limit @xmath216 , of interest here",
    ", it reduces to the asymptotic form @xmath217 thus , finally , we obtain @xmath218\\ ] ] this small ratio implies that bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays play no role for the average @xmath0-ray background above gev energies , if @xmath219 , taking into account , that @xmath220 is always smaller than 1 .",
    "we note that of order ten snrs of age younger than @xmath221  yr can on average lie within a 1 degree field of view of a detector directed towards the galactic center .",
    "therefore a moderate fluctuation of the measured @xmath0-ray intensity is expected due to variations of the actual number of snrs within such a detector s field of view . at the same time , for directions perpendicular to the galactic plane , the chance to observe the contribution of scr @xmath0-ray emission is quite negligible .",
    "a question is then how one might best study the nonuniformities of this background experimentally .",
    "clearly this is an investigation of its own .",
    "therefore we would like to restrict ourselves to a few comments here . due to the spectral form of the background",
    "its graininess is most pronounced at high @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "this is even more true due to the fact that for individual sources with a very low magnetic field the ic emission could be much stronger than the @xmath0-ray emission due to hadronic interactions ; in addition the ic emission has a harder spectrum .",
    "this suggests the use of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "their resolution in angle and energy is as good or better than that of other ground - based detectors .",
    "however , the study of extended sources is not an easy task with imaging telescopes which have a very limited field of view , even employing the stereoscopic method . for low brightness extended sources a satellite instrument like",
    "the future glast detector is well suited since it does not have to deal with the charged cr background due to its use of an anticoincidence shield . on the other hand",
    ", the statistics achievable with a small area space detector gets very low above a few tens of gev .",
    "thus one should probably attempt such a study with both types of instruments due to their complementary properties .",
    "a different question concerns the limitations of our approach due to its concentration on snrs as the sources of the gcrs . in fact the considerations in this paper can be applied to any alternative class of dominant gcr sources .",
    "the most important aspect , which leads to the dominance of scrs in high - energy @xmath0-ray production , is that the gcr sources should generate scrs with a spectrum that is significantly harder than the gcr spectrum .",
    "( 15 ) is valid for an arbitrary class of cr sources if we substitute some other value of the scr confinement time @xmath222 instead of @xmath9 , since the grammage @xmath87 is an experimentally fixed quantity .",
    "let us then assume that some class of compact cr sources produces an energy @xmath223 in the form of crs with spectrum @xmath103 with average frequency @xmath224 , and let us further assume that this spectrum remains unchanged inside the source regions for some period of time @xmath222 after which these crs are released into the ism as the gcrs .",
    "it is obvious that due to the general energy requirement the production rate @xmath225 should be about the same as @xmath226 .",
    "the scr energy @xmath223 , deposited in some initial volume @xmath227 , will produce a dynamically significant disturbance in the background ism if we assume that the initial scr energy density @xmath228 is much greater than the thermal ism energy density which in turn is of order @xmath24 .",
    "this will inevitably lead to the confinement of these scrs inside an expanding , disturbed volume for some period of time @xmath222 before the scrs will be released .",
    "it is difficult to give a general relation between @xmath223 and @xmath222 and there may exist only lower bounds on @xmath222 , given @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude speculative source classes with many weak but long - lived sources . the opposite case of many weak and short - lived sources",
    "is excluded to the extent that the present explanation of the hard @xmath0-ray spectrum by the contribution of the scrs is unique .",
    "our considerations suggest that the scrs can provide an essential contribution to the high - energy galactic @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "according to our estimates , depending on the parameters , the scr contribution is less than 10% of the gcr contribution at gev energies and it dominates at energies greater than 100  gev due to its essentially harder spectrum .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by calculations performed for the case when snrs are the main source of gcrs . at tev energies the scrs increase the expected @xmath0-ray flux from the galactic disk by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "the single physical parameter which determines the scr contribution due to hadronic interactions is the scr confinement time @xmath9 . as far as the @xmath0-ray emission due to @xmath229-decay is concerned , the above conclusions are valid for @xmath62  yr . since this scr contribution is proportional to @xmath9 , it would be negligible at tev energies if @xmath230  yr . a snr age of @xmath231  yr typically corresponds to the intermediate sedov phase , when the snr shock is still quite strong .",
    "therefore it seems to be quite improbable that the gcrs are replenished from snrs at such an early phase . for the ic contribution even a ten times shorter source life time would be sufficient at tev energies .",
    "in fact , for the tev ic emission the relevant time scale is the life time @xmath197 of parent scr electrons due to their synchrotron losses , which is indeed about @xmath232  yr . for decreasing @xmath0-ray energies @xmath197 increases beyond @xmath231  yrs , and therefore a source life time of this magnitude would become a limiting factor .",
    "our conclusions remain valid for alternative classes of possible gcr sources with comparable overall energy release and comparable individual confinement times .",
    "we note that this contribution of the dominant gcr sources necessarily exists .",
    "as we argue , it may be sufficient by itself to explain the observed @xmath0-ray excess , at least in the inner galaxy where it is well documented , without a need to invoke additional particle populations ( e.g. pohl & schlickeiser 1991 ) .",
