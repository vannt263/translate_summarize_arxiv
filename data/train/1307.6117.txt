    "in dimension @xmath2 , a real gaussian multiplicative chaos is a random measure on a given domain @xmath3 of @xmath4 that can be formally written , for any borel set @xmath5 as : @xmath6}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 stands for the lebesgue measure on @xmath3 ( more generally gaussian multiplicative chaos can also be constructed when @xmath7 is replaced by any radon measure : see @xcite for a recent review on the subject ) and @xmath8 is a centered gaussian distribution possessing a covariance kernel of the form : @xmath9=\\ln _ + \\frac{1}{|x - y|}+g(x , y),\\ ] ] with @xmath10 and @xmath11 a continuous function over @xmath12 .",
    "the covariance kernel thus possesses a singularity along the diagonal and it is clear that making sense of is not straightforward ( how do you define the exponential of a distribution ? ) .",
    "the standard approach consists in applying a  cut - off \" to the distribution @xmath8 , that is in regularizing the field @xmath8 in order to get rid of the singularity of the covariance kernel .",
    "the regularization usually depends on a small parameter , call it @xmath13 , that stands for the extent to which the field has been regularized .",
    "the measure is naturally understood as the limit of the random measures : @xmath14}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}x.\\ ] ] when the regularization parameter @xmath13 goes to @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that this procedure produces non trivial limiting objects when the real parameter @xmath16 is strictly less than the critical value @xmath17 .",
    "the critical case , i.e. @xmath18 , has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "an extra renormalization term is necessary to obtain a non - degenerate random limit @xmath19 .",
    "this limiting measure is also called the _ derivative gaussian multiplicative chaos _ because it can also be obtained by differentiating with respect to the parameter @xmath16 : @xmath20-x_{\\varepsilon}(x)\\big)e^{\\gamma_c x_{\\varepsilon}(x)-\\frac{\\gamma_c^2}{2}{\\mathds{e}}[x_{\\varepsilon}^2(x)]}\\,{\\mathrm{d}}x.\\ ] ] this object has recently received much attention because of its fundamental role in analyzing the behaviour of the maximum of log - correlated gaussian fields .",

    "the standard theory of gaussian multiplicative chaos has found many applications in finance , liouville quantum gravity or turbulence ( see @xcite and references therein ) . yet , the need of understanding the renormalization theory of gaussian multiplicative chaos with a complex value of the parameter @xmath16 has emerged .",
    "this is for instance the case in @xmath0-string theory and more precisely when looking at conformal field theories coupled to gravity ( see below ) .    in this paper , we consider two independent identically distributed centered gaussian distributions @xmath8 and @xmath26 , each of which with covariance kernel of the type . by considering their respective regularizations @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the problem addressed here is to find a proper renormalization as well as the limit of the family of complex random measures : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are real constants .",
    "the convention for @xmath31 we will use in this paper is thus different than the one sometimes used in the real case , i.e. where one already renormalizes by the mean in the definition .",
    "notice that we may restrict to the case when @xmath30 are nonnegative by symmetry of the gaussian law .",
    "we will see that the renormalization theory of these measures presents three phases , summarized in figure [ diagram ] , depending on the considered values of @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is of course natural to consider other frameworks than the one considered in this paper .",
    "for example , one can consider the general case where for all fixed @xmath32 the variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 have some fixed correlation @xmath35 $ ] . in this case , one expects a similar phase diagram to hold , at least at the level of the free energy of the system .",
    "more specifically , if @xmath36 is a fixed set , the following limit @xmath37 should be independent from @xmath38 . however , we are not aware of a solid argument which would say that the proper renormalization of @xmath31 ( which is the object of this work in the case @xmath39 ) is independent from @xmath38 ( except in the inner phase i where it is a consequence of the results of @xcite in dimension 1 ) .",
    "let us stress that the general case is of course interesting ( and natural to look at in the case @xmath40 ) but its study requires new ideas beyond the methodology of this paper .",
    "we first mention the recent work @xcite where the authors conduct a thorough study of all phases ( inner and frontier ) in the simpler context of the complex random energy model ( rem ) partition function .",
    "they give the precise asymptotics of all phases .",
    "note that in this context , phase i ( inner and frontier ) is trivial at order 1 as the ( mean ) renormalized partition function converges to a non vanishing constant : this is due to the lack of correlations in the model .",
    "hence , in @xcite , the authors go in fact one step further as they give the fluctuations .",
    "as is now well known , correlations may be added for instance on a tree structure like mandelbrot multiplicative cascades . in this context , this problem is investigated in @xcite . in the pioneering work @xcite , the authors computed the free energy and deduced a phase diagram similar to our figure [ diagram ] . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors treat the case of dyadic multiplicative cascades .",
    "since this model is @xmath41-dimensional , they consider the complex random measure @xmath31 as a random function @xmath42)$ ] .",
    "translated in our context , the results in @xcite are the following :    * phase i : the authors prove that there is almost sure convergence in the space of continuous functions when @xmath31 is renormalized by its mean .",
    "in fact , in the companion paper @xcite , the authors show almost sure convergence in the space of continuous functions for a class of models that includes the one we consider here ( except for gaussian free fields ) . * phase ii , frontier i / ii , frontier ii / iii and triple point : not investigated .",
    "* phase iii and frontier i / iii : : the authors show that the sequence is tight when @xmath31 is properly renormalized ( in this case , the renormalization is different than the one in phase i ) .",
    "convergence is not investigated .",
    "we further stress that the authors in @xcite do not prove convergence in law in phase iii but claim that if convergence holds then every possible limit is a brownian motion in multifractal time .",
    "the argument is based on the uniqueness property of the solution of some fixed point equation , the star equation for multiplicative cascades .",
    "the corresponding equation for gaussian multiplicative chaos has been introduced in @xcite but uniqueness has only been established in the real subcritical case so far .",
    "so the same argument can not be used in the context of gaussian multiplicative chaos .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is not only to investigate the phase diagram in the context of gaussian multiplicative chaos but also to describe the limiting object that we obtain when renormalizing properly the family @xmath43 as @xmath44 .",
    "we will first show that the model exhibits three phases , which are represented in figure [ diagram ] .",
    "we will also describe the limiting objects after renormalization .",
    "apart from the inner phase i and the frontier of phases i / ii where the renormalization procedure produces new objects , we prove that the renormalization procedure leads to objects that can be described in terms of the limiting measures that we get on the real line @xmath45 . roughly speaking , in phase ii ( excluding frontier",
    "i / ii and the real line @xmath45 ) and in phase iii ( and the frontier i / iii ) , we get a complex gaussian white noise ( see for a definition ) with a random intensity : the real part @xmath46 governs the description of the intensity whereas all the information about the field @xmath26 is lost into a white noise ( a similar phenomenon is observed in @xcite for a different model ) .",
    "figure [ limit ] is a brief yet complete description of the picture we draw .",
    "actually , we do not treat the triple point and the description we give in the inner phase ii is a conjecture : our method to explain how the complex gaussian random measure appears indicates that the inner phase ii can be described by a complex gaussian random measure with random intensity given by the objects we get in the real supercritical case ( @xmath47 ) : see section [ sec : conj ] for more on this .",
