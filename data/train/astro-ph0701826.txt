    "this reduction would be most useful for numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately @xmath22 only for very special@xcite configurations .",
    "in addition , though the field @xmath21 has been shown to be small@xcite for some configurations , neglecting it when simulating time - dependent dynamical processes has dramatic effects such as non - conservation@xcite of the total linear momentum .",
    "several astronomical observational data appear consistent@xcite with the mond hypothesis , and also a relativistic version@xcite of mond is now available , making it an interesting alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm",
    ". however , dynamical processes in mond have been investigated very little@xcite so far , mainly due to difficulties posed by the non - linearity of eq .",

    "our mond n - body code@xcite is based on a particle - mesh scheme with quadratic spline interpolations",
    ". the spherical grid on which eq .",
    "( [ eqmond ] ) is solved is made of @xmath24 points .",
    "we use leap - frog time integration , where the adaptive time - step is the same for all particles .",
    "all the computations on the particles and the particle - mesh interpolations can be split among different processors , while the iterative potential solver computations are not performed in parallel : however , at each time step we can use the potential previously determined as seed solution .",
    "we succesfully tested the code by running newtonian simulations ( i.e. , by solving eq .",
    "[ [ eqmond ] ] in the limit @xmath25 ) , and comparing the results with those of simulations performed with our fvfps@xcite treecode starting from the same initial conditions .",
    "we also verified that the code reproduces the newtonian and mond conservation laws .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 for virialized systems in mond and in newtonian gravity , where @xmath27 is the total kinetic energy and @xmath28 is the trace of the potential energy tensor@xcite @xmath29 note that in mond @xmath30 is _ not _ the total energy , and is not conserved .",

    "the choice of appropriate scaling physical units is an important aspect of mond n - body simulations .",
    "a full discussion of this point can be found in nlc ; here we just recall that , while in newtonian simulations the natural scaling units are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , in the dmond case one has @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath33 are the length and mass units in which the initial conditions are expressed .    in nlc we performed a set of n - body simulations of dissipationless collapses , starting from the same phase - space configuration , i.e. , from a cold ( @xmath41 ) plummer@xcite sphere of total mass @xmath33 and  core \" radius @xmath40 .",
    "the gravitational potential is newtonian in simulation n and dmond in simulation d ; the full mond simulations are not described here ( see nlc ) .",
    "all the simulations ( @xmath42 particles , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) are evolved up to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is defined as the time at which @xmath48 reaches its maximum value ( @xmath49 in simulation d , and @xmath50 in n ) .",
    "the center of mass , and the modulus of the total angular momentum ( in units of @xmath51 for model n and of @xmath52 for model d ) oscillates around zero with r.m.s @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath30 in simulation n , and @xmath31 in simulation d are conserved to within @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the final angle - averaged density profiles are fitted with a @xmath57-model@xcite @xmath58 for each end - product we also measure the axis ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the inertia ellipsoid@xcite ( @xmath61 ) , the ellipticity @xmath62 of the projections along the principal axis , and the corresponding circularized effective radius @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting circularized projected density profiles are fitted with the sersic@xcite law @xmath64},\\ ] ] where@xcite @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath66 is the only free parameter , because @xmath63 and @xmath67 are fixed by particle count .",
    "all the final virialized systems in nlc depart significantly from spherical symmetry .",
    "in particular , the d end - product is triaxial ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ) , while model n is oblate ( @xmath71 ; @xmath72 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with those observed in real ellipticals , with the exception of model d , which would correspond to an e8 galaxy .",
    "thus , mond gravity could be able to produce some system that would be unstable in newtonian gravity .",
    "the final angle - averaged density of model n is well described by eq .",
    "( [ eqgamma ] ) with @xmath73 , while @xmath74 in model d. equation  ( [ eqser ] ) fits remarkably well the final surface density profiles ( best - fit index @xmath75 in model n , and @xmath76 in d , see table 2 in nlc ) , with average residuals @xmath77 , where @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "note that the fitting radial range @xmath79 is comparable with or larger than the typical ranges@xcite spanned by observations .",
    "the internal kinematics of the end - products is quantified by the angle - averaged radial and tangential components of their velocity - dispersion tensor ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , and by the anisotropy parameter @xmath82 .",
    "all systems are strongly radially anisotropic outside the half - mass radius .",
    "the @xmath80 profile decreases steeply in the final state of model n , while it presents a hole in the inner regions of model d. in addition , model d is radially anisotropic ( @xmath83 ) even in the central regions , where model n is approximately isotropic ( @xmath84 ) . the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath85 declines steeply within @xmath63 in model n , while the d profile is significantly flatter .      in newtonian gravity ,",
    "collisionless systems virialize through violent relaxation in few dynamical times , as predicted by the theory@xcite and confirmed by numerical@xcite simulations .",
    "due to the non linearity of the theory , the details of relaxation processes and virialization in mond are much less known . in fig .",
    "[ figtime ] we show the time evolution of @xmath86 , @xmath31 , and @xmath30 for simulations d and n of nlc . in simulation n , @xmath86 has a peak , then oscillates , and eventually converges to the equilibrium value 1 ; the total energy @xmath30 is nicely conserved .",
    "the time evolution is significantly different in simulation d , where @xmath31 is constant as expected , but @xmath86 _ still oscillates at very late times _ because of the oscillations of @xmath27 .    a different view of phase space is given in fig .  [ figphsp ] , where we plot time snapshots of the particles radial velocity vs. radius for simulations d and n. at @xmath87 ( time of the peak of @xmath86 ) , sharp shells in phase space are present , indicating that particles are moving in and out collectively and phase mixing has not taken place yet . at significantly late times ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "when the systems are almost virialized ( @xmath89 ) , phase mixing is complete in simulation n , but phase space shells still survive in model d. finally , the bottom panels show the @xmath90 plane at equilibrium ( @xmath46 ) , when phase mixing is completed also in model d : note how the populated regions are significantly different for the two models .",
    "thus , nlc results indicate that phase mixing in more effective in newtonian gravity than in mond . _ here we address the issue of the importance of the force angular components during the collapse .",
    "in fact , one could speculate that a different behavior of radial orbit instability in mond and in newtonian gravity could be at the origin of the different time scale of phase mixing_. as shown in fig.3 , also the new simulations confirm that phase mixing is less effective in mond than in newtonian gravity ( even though virialization times are now longer than in nlc models , due to the reduced number of active degrees of freedom ) .    in nlc we obtained additional information on the relaxation process from the differential energy distribution@xcite @xmath91 ( i.e. the number of particles with energy per unit mass between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "in newtonian gravity @xmath4 is usually set to zero at infinity for finite - mass systems , so @xmath94 for bound particles ; in mond all particles are bound independently of their velocity , because @xmath4 is confining , and all energies are admissible ( see fig .  5 of nlc ) .",
    "given that the particles are at rest at @xmath95 , the initial @xmath91 depends only @xmath96 at @xmath95 , and it is significantly different in the newtonian and mond cases .",
    "in accordance with previous studies , we found that in the newtonian case the final @xmath91 is well represented by an exponential function@xcite over most of the populated energy range .",
    "in contrast , in model d the final @xmath91 decreases for increasing energy , qualitatively preserving its initial shape .",
    "_ we interpret this result as another manifestation of a less effective phase space reorganization in mond than in newtonian collapses_.",
    "we presented results of dissipationless collapses in mond , focusing on the relaxation process .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) newtonian collapses produced cuspier density profiles than mond simulations ( @xmath97 and @xmath75 vs. @xmath74 and @xmath1 ) . in both cases the sersic fits are remarkably good over a large radial interval . in addition , newtonian models are isotropic in the central regions , while dmond models are radially anisotropic down to the center .",
    "\\2 ) in nlc we found that final states of full mond models , if interpreted in the context of newtonian gravity , are characterized by a _ dividing radius _ of the order of @xmath63 , separating a baryon - dominated inner region from a dark - matter dominated outer region , in accordance@xcite with observations of elliptical galaxies . however , we were not able to reproduce the observed scaling laws of elliptical galaxies _ under the assumption of a luminosity - independent stellar mass - to - light ratio_.",
    "\\3 ) phase mixing is less effective ( and stellar systems take longer to relax ) in mond than in newtonian gravity .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by numerical simulations in which the angular force components are frozen to zero , so possible differences in radial orbit instability between newtonian and mond gravity are not relevant in the present context .",
    "our results on mixing suggest that merging could take longer in mond than in newtonian gravity ; on the other hand , analytical estimates of the two - body relaxation time seem to indicate@xcite the opposite , predicting shorter dynamical friction time - scales in mond than in newtonian gravity : the next application of our code will be the study of galaxy merging in mond .",
