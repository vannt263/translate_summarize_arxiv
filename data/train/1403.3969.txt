    "noncooperative _ game theory , the possible actions of the players are represented explicitly , together with payoffs that the players want to maximize for themselves .",
    "basic models are the _ extensive _ form represented by a game tree with possible imperfect information represented by information sets , and the _ strategic _ ( or `` normal '' ) form that lists the players strategies , which they choose independently , together with a table of the players payoffs for each strategy profile .",
    "the central concept for noncooperative games is the _ nash equilibrium _ which prescribes a strategy for each player that is optimal when the other players keep their prescribed strategies fixed .",
    "every finite game has an equilibrium when players are allowed to _ mix _ ( randomize ) their actions ( nash , 1951 ) .",
    "a game may have more than one nash equilibrium .",
    "finding one or all nash equilibria of a game is often a laborious task .    in this paper , we describe the _ game theory explorer _ ( gte ) software that allows to create games in extensive or strategic form , and to compute their nash equilibria .",
    "gte is primarily intended for the applied game theorist who is not an expert in equilibrium computation , for example an experimental economist who designs experiments to test if subjects play equilibrium strategies .",
    "the user can easily vary the parameters of the game - theoretic model , and study more complex games , because their equilibrium analysis is quickly provided by the algorithm .",
    "the analysis of a game with general mathematical parameters is also aided by knowing its equilibria for specific numerical values of those parameters .",
    "as our exposition will demonstrate , gte can also be used for more theoretical research in game theory , for example on strategic stability ( see section  [ s - strategic ] ) .",
    "the ease of creating , displaying , and analyzing games suggests gte also as an _ educational tool _ for game theory .",
    "computing equilibria is a main research topic of the authors , and in later sections we will explain some of our results on finding equilibria of two - player games in strategic form ( avis et al . , 2010 ) and extensive form based on the `` sequence form '' ( von stengel , 1996 ) .",
    "scientific algorithms are often implemented as prototopes to show that they work , as done , for example , by audet et al.(2001 ) , or von stengel , van den elzen , and talman ( 2002 ) . however , providing a robust user interface to create games is much more involved , and necessary to make such algorithms useful for a wider research community . in particular ,",
    "the drawing of game trees should be done with a friendly _ graphical user interface _ ( gui ) where the game tree can be created and seen on the screen , and be stored , retrieved , and changed in an intuitive manner .",
    "this is one of the purposes of the gte software presented in this article .",
    "an existing suite of software for game - theoretic analysis is _ gambit _ ( mckelvey , mclennan , and turocy , 2010 ) .",
    "gambit has been developed over the course of nearly 25 years and presents a library of solution algorithms , formats for storing games , ways to program the creation of games with the help of the python programming language , and a gui for creating game trees .",
    "it is open - source software that is free to use and that can be extended by anyone .",
    "given the mature state of gambit and the joint research interests and close contacts with its developers , it is clear that any improvements offered by gte should eventually be integrated into gambit .",
    "other existing game solvers are gameplan ( langlois , 2006 ) and xgame ( belhaiza , mve , and audet , 2010 ) .    the main difference of gte to gambit is the provided access to the software and the user interface . in terms of access",
    ", gambit needs to be downloaded and installed ; it is offered on the main personal computing platforms windows , linux or mac .",
    "getting the program to run may require some patience and technical experience with software installions , which may present a `` barrier to entry '' for its use .",
    "in contrast , gte is started in a _ web browser _ via the web address http://www.gametheoryexplorer.org .",
    "all interaction with the software is via the browser interface .",
    "the created games and their output can be saved as files by the user on their local computer .",
    "this avoids the technical hurdles of installing software on the user side , and simplifies updating the software .",
    "the graphical display of game trees in gte is user - friendly and can be customized , such as growing the tree in the vertical or horizontal direction .",
    "gte can even be used just as a drawing tool for games , which can be exported as pictures to file formats for use in papers or presentations .    providing application software via the web has the following disadvantages compared to installed software .",
    "first , a higher complexity of the program for the required communication over the internet ; however , manifold standard solutions are freely available .",
    "second , limited control over the user s local computing resources for security reasons .",
    "this is an issue because equilibrium computation for larger games is computationally intensive .",
    "for that reason , this computation takes place on the central public server rather than the user s client computer ; we will explain the technical issues in section  [ s - software ] .",
    "third , in our case , currently very limited use of the existing gambit software .",
    "we envisage a loosely coupled integration , in particular with gambit s game solvers .",
    "gte is very much under development in this respect .",
    "we describe gte , first from the perspective of the user , with an example in section  [ s - example ] , and the general creation of extensive and strategic - form games in sections [ s - extensive ] and  [ s - strategic ] .",
    "we explain the main algorithms for finding all equilibria for games in strategic form in section  [ s - algostrat ] , including issues for handling larger games where one has to restrict oneself to finding sample equilibria ( which , in particular , does not allow to decide if the game has a unique equilibrium ) . for extensive games , the computation of behavior strategies , which are exponentially less complex than mixed strategies ,",
    "is outlined in section  [ s - sequenceform ] .",
    "the software architecture and the communication between server and client computers is discussed , with as little technical jargon as possible , in section  [ s - software ] . in conclusion ,",
    "we mention the difficulties of incentives and funding for implementing user - friendly scientific software , and call for contributions of volunteers .",
    "in this section we describe a simple @xmath0 game , due to bagwell ( 1995 ) , together with its `` commitment '' or `` stackelberg '' variant which has more strategies .",
    "this game is created and analyzed very simply with gte , where we demonstrate the computed equilibria .",

    "a game tree with perfect information can be solved by `` backward induction '' which defines a _ subgame perfect equilibrium _ or spe , which is indeed a nash equilibrium . here",
    ", player  2 s optimal moves are @xmath5 and @xmath11 , which defines her strategy @xmath12 . given these choices of player  2 , the optimal move of player  1 is  @xmath7 .",
    "this defines the spe @xmath13 . in general , a strategy in an extensive game specifies a move at each information set of the player , so player  2 has the four strategies @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 listed as columns in the strategic form on the right in fig .",

    "this is an equilibrium because neither player can unilaterally improve his or her payoff , under the crucial assumption of equilibrium that the strategy of the other player stays fixed : when player  1 chooses @xmath7 instead of @xmath4 and player  2 plays @xmath16 , then player  1 receives a payoff of @xmath22 rather than @xmath21 and therefore prefers to stay with  @xmath4 . in turn , @xmath11 is an optimal move when player  1 chooses  @xmath4 .",

    "[ f1 ] translated to the commitment game where player  2 , even though she can now react to the move of player  1 , always chooses the equivalent of the original move  @xmath6 . however , this equilibrium is not subgame perfect because it prescribes the suboptimal move @xmath6 in the subgame that starts with the left node of player  2 .",
    "in addition to these two pure - strategy equilibria , the game in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] has additional equilibria where player  2 makes a random choice at the node that is unreached due to the move of player  1 .",
    "because the node is unreached , any choice of player  2 is optimal because it has no effect on her payoffs , but that random choice must not change the preference of player  1 for his move in order to keep the equilibrium property .",
    "move @xmath4 of player  1 , followed necessarily by move @xmath11 of player  2 , is optimal for player  1 as long as his expected payoff for @xmath7 is at most  @xmath21 , which is the case whenever player  2 makes move @xmath6 with probability at least @xmath23 .",
    "the two extreme cases are the pure strategy equilibrium @xmath20 already discussed and the mixed strategy equilibrium where player  1 chooses @xmath4 and player  2 mixes between @xmath12 and @xmath16 with probability @xmath23 each .",
    "this is represented by the probability vector @xmath24 for the four strategies of player  2 .",
    "similarly , an equilibrium that has the same outcome with payoffs @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the spe but a suboptimal random choice between @xmath10 and @xmath11 of player  2 is @xmath25 where player mixes between @xmath14 and @xmath12 with probability @xmath23 each ; @xmath23 is the largest probability that player  2 can assign to @xmath10 so that @xmath7 stays a best response of player  1 .",

    "_ vertex enumeration _ , that is , listing all vertices of a polyhedron defined by linear inequalities , is a well - studied problem where we use the _ lexicographic reverse search _ method _ lrs _ by avis ( 2000 ; 2006 ) .",
    "this method reverses the steps of the simplex algorithm for linear programming for a certain deterministic pivoting rule .",
    "it starts with a vertex @xmath101 of the polyhedron and a linear objective function that is maximized at that vertex . the simplex algorithm for maximizing this linear function computes from every vertex a path of _ pivoting steps _ to  @xmath101 . with a deterministic pivoting rule ,",
    "that path is unique . in lrs",
    ", the pivoting rule chooses as entering variable the variable with the least index ( i.e. , smallest subscript ) that improves the objective function , and the leaving variable via a lexicographic rule .",
    "the unique paths of simplex steps from the vertices to @xmath101 define a tree with root  @xmath101 .",
    "the lrs algorithm explores this tree by traversing the tree edges in the reverse direction using a depth - first search .    in lrs , as in the simplex algorithm ,",
    "the vertices of @xmath92 are represented by _ basic feasible solutions _ to the inequalities in ( [ pq ] ) when they are represented in equality form via slack variables . here , these are vectors @xmath102 in @xmath103 and @xmath6 in @xmath57 so that the constraints that define @xmath66 and @xmath74 are written as @xmath104 for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 and @xmath108 so that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "a feasible solution @xmath111 to ( [ rs ] ) defines a point in @xmath92 and vice versa .",
    "a tight inequality corresponds to a slack variable that is zero .",
    "in fact , the labels for a strategy pair @xmath112 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chosen minimally so that ( [ rs ] ) holds , which determines @xmath6 and @xmath102 , are the pure strategies @xmath59",
    "so that @xmath113 or @xmath114 for player  1 and @xmath83 or @xmath115 for player  2 . the equilibrium condition of being completely labeled is equivalent to the _ complementarity _ condition @xmath116 in a basic feasible solution to ( [ rs ] ) , the labels correspond to the indices @xmath59 or @xmath78 of the nonbasic variables , and to basic variables that happen to have value zero .",
    "basic solutions where basic variables have value zero are called _ degenerate _ , and games where this happens are also called degenerate .",
    "it is easy to see ( see von stengel , 2002 ) that this corresponds to a mixed strategy of a player that has more best responses than the size of its support ; in terms of labels , this defines a point of  @xmath66 with more than @xmath1 labels or a point of @xmath74 with more than @xmath2 labels .",
    "an example is the degenerate game in fig .",
    "[ fthreat ] where the pure strategy @xmath7 ( which is a mixed strategy @xmath117 with a support of size one ) has two best responses , which is the point @xmath100 of @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fupperlabel ] with three labels @xmath118 . for extensive games ,",
    "the strategic form is typically degenerate , as the examples in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and  [ fthreat ] demonstrate . in lrs ,",
    "all arithmetic computations are done in _ arbitrary precision arithmetic _",
    "( rather than floating point arithmetic with possible rounding errors ) in order to recognize with certainty that a basic variable is zero .",
    "in addition , lrs uses the economical _ integer pivoting _ method where basic feasible solutions are represented with integers rather than rational numbers ; see , for example , von stengel ( 2007 , section  3.5 ) .",
    "after enumerating all vertices of @xmath66 and @xmath74 with lrs , those pairs that fulfill the complementarity condition ( [ compl ] ) are the extreme equilibria of the game .",
    "avis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also describe an improved method _",
    "lrsnash _ , which is used in gte , where only the vertices of one polytope , say @xmath66 , are generated , and the set @xmath17 of labels _ missing _ from each such vertex @xmath94 is used to identify the face @xmath119 of the other polytope that has exactly the labels in  @xmath17 .",
    "if this face is not empty , then each of its vertices @xmath81 defines an extreme equilibrium @xmath90 .",
    "an alternative method to enumerate all extreme equilibria is the eee method of audet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) which performs a depth - first search that chooses one tight inequality for either player in each search step . in avis",
    "et al .  ( 2010 ) , eee is implemented with exact integer arithmetic and compared with _",
    "lrsnash _ , and performs better for larger games from size @xmath120 onwards .",
    "given the list of extreme equilibria , the set of all equilibria is completely described as follows ( for details see avis et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "consider the bipartite graph @xmath121 with edges @xmath90 that are the extreme equilibria .",
    "each connected component @xmath122 of this graph defines a topologically connected component of equilibria , as it is output by gte . for each @xmath122 , identify the maximal bipartite `` cliques '' in @xmath121 of the form @xmath123 , that is , every pair @xmath90 in @xmath124 is an extreme equilibrium .",
    "then any convex combination of @xmath125 paired with any convex combination of @xmath126 is also a nash equilibrium , and every equilibrium of the game can be represented in this way .",
    "there may be several such cliques that define a component @xmath122 , as in fig .",
    "[ fring ] and  [ fkm ] above . in gte , the maximal cliques @xmath124 are computed with an extension of the fast clique enumeration algorithm by bron and kerbosch ( 1973 ) .    for a two - player game in strategic form",
    ", gte computes by default all nash equilibria , as just described .",
    "however , the state - of - the - art algorithms _ lrsnash _ and eee have exponential running time due the typically exponential growth of the number of vertices of @xmath92 .",
    "these equilibrium enumeration algorithms therefore take prohibitively long for games with more than 25 , certainly 30 pure strategies for each player . in addition",
    ", it is np - hard to decide if a bimatrix game has more than one nash equilibrium ( gilboa and zemel , 1989 ; conitzer and sandholm , 2008 ) , so one can not expect to answer that question quickly for larger games .    in practice",
    ", a finite game may represent a discretization of an infinite game , where it may be useful to know its equilibria when each player has several hundred strategies . in that case",
    ", it is still possible to use methods that find one equilibrium , such as the classic algorithm by lemke and howson ( 1964 ) .",
    "this is a path - following algorithm that follows a sequence of pivoting steps , similar to the simplex algorithm for linear programming ( for expositions see shapley , 1974 , or von stengel , 2002 ; 2007 ) . like the simplex algorithm",
    ", it can take exponentially many steps on certain worst - case instances ( savani and von stengel , 2006 ) . however , these seem to be rare in practice , and the algorithm is typically fast for random games .",
    "the lemke ",
    "howson algorithm has a free parameter , which is a pure strategy of a player that together with the best response to that strategy defines a `` starting point '' of the algorithm in the space of mixed strategies @xmath127 .",
    "varying this starting point over all pure strategies may lead to different equilibria ( however , if that is not the case , the game may still have equilibria that are elusive to the algorithm ) .",
    "gte uses a related but different method that is implemented using the algorithm by lemke ( 1965 ) , which allows for starting points that can be arbitrary mixed strategy pairs @xmath128 ( von stengel , van den elzen , and talman , 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the computation can be interpreted as the `` tracing procedure '' by harsanyi and selten ( 1988 ) , where players strategies are best responses to a weighted combination of their _ prior _ @xmath128 and the actual strategies that they are playing .",
    "initially , the players only react to the prior , whose weight is then decreased ; equilibrium is reached when the weight of the prior becomes zero .",
    "if starting from sufficiently many random priors gives always the same equilibrium , this does not prove that this equilibrium is unique , but may be considered as sufficient reason to suggest this as a plausible way to play the game .",
    "the computational experiments of von stengel , van den elzen , and talman ( 2002 ) show that for random games , the method finds an equilibrium in a small number of pivoting steps , and that typically many equilibria are found by varying the prior by choosing it uniformly at random from the strategy simplices . for a systematic investigation of this method in gte",
    ", it would be useful to generate larger games as discretizations of games defined by arithmetic formulas for payoff functions ; this is a future programming project where a closer integration with gambit is envisaged .",
    "the standard approach to finding equilibria of an extensive game is to convert it to strategic form , and to apply the corresponding algorithms .",
    "however , the number of pure strategies grows typically _ exponentially _ in the size of the game tree .",
    "in contrast , the _ sequence form _ is a strategic description that has the same size as the game tree , which is used in gte .",
    "we sketch the main ideas here ; for more details see von stengel ( 1996 ; 2002 ) or von stengel , van den elzen , and talman ( 2002 ) .",
    "[ fef5 ] shows an extensive game where player  1 has four moves at the root and two moves at his second information set .",
    "player  2 has perfect information and four singleton information sets with two moves each .",
    "a pure strategy of a player defines a move for every information set , so player  1 has 8 and player  2 has 16 pure strategies . some of these pure strategies can be identified because they describe the same `` plan '' of playing the game .",
    "a _ reduced _ pure strategy does not specify a move at an information set that is unreached due to an earlier own move of the player .",
    "for example , after move @xmath10 player  2 does not need to specify move @xmath129 or  @xmath130 because the information set with that move can not be reached .",
    "we represent such an unspecified move by an asterisk `` '' at the place where the move would be listed , so @xmath131 is a reduced strategy where @xmath132 stands for either @xmath129 or  @xmath130 , as in the strategy @xmath133 where no reduction is possible .",
    "the reduced strategic form is shown in fig .",
    "[ fsf5 ] , which is a @xmath134 game .",
    "each cell shows the payoffs that result when the two strategies meet .    .",
    "in a reduced strategy , any move at an information set that can not be reached due to an earlier own move is left unspecified and replaced by  `` '' . ]    in this game , a _ mixed strategy _ requires four independent probabilities for player  1 ( the fifth is then determined because probabilities sum to one ) and eleven for player  2 .",
    "in general , the number of reduced strategies is _ exponential _ in the size of the game tree , so there is a large number of mixed strategy probabilities to compute .    .",
    "all empty cells have zero entries .",
    "the rows are played with a probability distribution , whereas the columns are played with weights @xmath135 subject to the equations @xmath136 . ]",
    "the _ sequence form _ is a compact strategic description of the game that has the _ same _ size as the game tree . instead of strategies",
    ", it uses _ sequences _ of moves of a given player along a path from the root to a leaf .",
    "the payoff matrices are sparse and contain payoffs for those pairs of sequences of the two players that lead to a leaf , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fseq5 ] for the game in fig .",
    "this table is evidently more compact , and vastly more so for larger games . in this game ,",
    "sequences and reduced strategies coincide for player  1 , because that player does not get any information about the moves of the other player . for player  2 ,",
    "her sequences @xmath137 are played with probabilities @xmath135 that are not distributions over the set of all sequences , but are subject to three separate equations @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "these equations express the revealed information to player  2 following the respective moves @xmath41 , @xmath4 , and @xmath122 of player  1 , and can be derived systematically from the structure of the information sets ( with one equation per information set , where we have substituted some equations such as @xmath141 for the unused nonterminal sequence  @xmath11 ; also , player  2 s empty sequence @xmath142 leads here to the rightmost leaf and has constant probability @xmath143 ) .",
    "the twelve reduced strategies of player  2 are in effect the combinations of one of the sequences @xmath144 combined with one of @xmath145 and one of @xmath146 , respectively . in the sequence form , these sequences are randomized _ independently_.",
    "this randomization translates to a _ behavior strategy _",
    ", where the player randomizes locally over his moves at each information set rather than globally over his pure strategies as in a mixed strategy .",
    "the underlying assumption about the information sets is that of _ perfect recall _ which says that a player does not forget what he knew or did earlier . using the sequence form implies the theorem of kuhn ( 1953 ) that a player with perfect recall can replace a mixed strategy by an equivalent behavior strategy .    in gte",
    ", the sequence form is implemented with the path - following algorithm of lemke ( 1965 ) mentioned at the end of the previous section , as described by von stengel , van den elzen , and talman ( 2002 ) , which starts from an arbitrary `` prior '' as a starting vector and finds one equilibrium .",
    "it can be applied to relatively large extensive games where the strategic form is hopelessly large to be used . for smaller extensive games , an enumeration of all nash equilibria based on the sequence form",
    "is implemented as described by huang ( 2011 , chapter  2 ) ; for a related approach see audet , belhaiza , and hansen ( 2009 ) .",
    "the number of independent probabilities in the sequence form is at most that number in the reduced strategic form .",
    "for example , player  2 in fig .",
    "[ fseq5 ] has four such independent probabilities , like @xmath147 , as opposed to eleven for her reduced strategies ; player  1 has four independent probabilities for both sequences and reduced strategies .",
    "huang s approach only uses these independent probabilities and thus keeps a low dimension of the suitably defined best - response polyhedra , which is important for the employed vertex enumeration algorithms that have exponential running time .",
    "in this final section , we describe the architecture of the gte software on the server and client computers , and its development .",
    "the gte program is open - source and part of the gambit project , with the goal of further integration with the existing gambit modules .",
    "the development is time intensive and relies on the efforts of volunteers , where we strongly invite any interested programmer to contribute .",
    "the gte software is accessed by a web browser . behind its web address",
    "runs a _ server _",
    "computer , which delivers a webpage and the game - drawing software of gte to the user s _ client _ computer .",
    "the user can then create games , and store them on his client computer .",
    "the _ game solvers _ for equilibrium computation reside on the server .",
    "they are invoked by sending a description of the game from the client to the server over the internet .",
    "when the algorithm has terminated , the server sends the text with the computed equilibria back to the client where they are displayed .",
    "the client program with the graphical user interface ( gui ) is written in a variant of the javascript programming language called actionscript which is displayed with the `` flash player '' .",
    "flash is a common software that runs as a `` plug - in '' on most web browsers .",
    "we chose flash for gte in 2010 because of the predictability and speed of its graphical display .",
    "however , flash does not work on the ipad and iphone mobile devices ( it does work on regular apple computers ) , with the more universally accepted html5 standard as its suggested replacement . in the future",
    ", we plan to replace the actionscript programs by regular javascript along with streamlining and further improving the gui part of gte .    for security reasons",
    ", the client program requires active permission of the user when writing or reading files on the client computer . when storing or loading a game as a local file , this is anyhow initiated by the user and therefore causes no additional delay",
    "we have designed a special xml format for games in extensive or strategic form , where xml stands for `` extensible markup language '' similar to the html language for web pages .",
    "the tree is described by its logical structure .",
    "for example , the leftmost leaf in fig .",
    "[ fthreat ] reached by move @xmath7 is encoded as follows : -.5em    ....",
    "< outcome move=\"t \" >          < payoff player=\"1\">1</payoff >          < payoff player=\"2\">3</payoff >       < /outcome > ....    in addition , the file contains parameters for graphical settings such as the orientation of the game tree .",
    "the files can be converted to and from the file format used by gambit .",
    "the xml description is also used to encode the game for sending it to the server for running a game solver .",
    "communication with the server requires identifying the user when there are different simultaneous client sessions , and the use of the relevant internet protocols .",
    "these are standard methods used for typical internet transactions , which we use as freely available routines in the java programming language in which we have written the server programs .    the first version of gte was written on a publically provided server ( the google app engine ) .",
    "for security reasons , all programs on that platform have to be written in java , and are restricted in their ability to access programs written in other programming languages , called `` native '' code .",
    "in particular , we could not use the c program lrs for vertex enumeration , which was therefore rewritten in java .",
    "however , this requires to duplicate in java any improvement of lrs such as the _ lrsnash _ program mentioned in section  [ s - algostrat ] , which is inefficient and prone to errors .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to incorporate other game solvers .",
    "for that reason , the web server for gte is now provided on a university computer , and uses the original lrs code of avis ( 2006 ) .",
    "gte allows to compute all nash equilibria of a two - player game , but the running time increases exponentially with the size of the game .",
    "this means that there is a relatively narrow range of input size ( currently about 15 to 20 strategies per player ) where the efficiency of the implementation ( such as a factor of ten in running time ) matters , and beyond which the computation takes an impractically long time . for small games , the game solvers would run satisfactorily on the client using javascript , although at present there are no good arbitrary precision arithmetic routines for this programming language , apart from having to implement the algorithms separately . for games of `` medium '' size ( below the `` exponential barrier '' ) ,",
    "it is best to use a state - of - the - art algorithm on the server , which works equally well for small games .",
    "however , one problem is that computations of , say , one hour also use the computational resources of the server , which degrade its performance , and which will be slow if there are multiple such computations at the same time . here",
    ", we provide the option of installing the server on any local computer , which then also works independently of an internet connection .",
    "this requires downloading and compiling the gte code , together with the necessary components of a java compiler , a lightweight server program called `` jetty '' to communicate locally with the web browser , and the ( free ) software for compiling the actionscript part of gte into an executable flash program .",
    "this requires time and patience , probably more so than an installation of gambit , but offers the same interface as that known from the web , so that the user may find the investment worth it .",
    "all gte software is open source and free to use and alter under the gnu general public licence ( which requires derived software to be free as well ) .",
    "the software repository is at https://github.com/gambitproject/gte/wiki ( including documentation ) , as part of the gambit project which has long been open - source .",
    "the version control system and collaborative tool `` git '' stores the current and all previous versions of the project .",
    "git efficiently stores snapshots of the entire project with all modules and documentation , which can be branched off and re - merged in decentralized development branches .",
    "the github repository for storing projects developed with git is free to use for open - source software , and offers a convenient web interface for administration and documentation .",
    "open - source software is the appropriate way to develop an academic project such as gte which has limited commercial use .",
    "academic software should be publically available for making computations reproducible , which is increasingly recognized as a need for validating scientific results that rely on computation ( barnes , 2010 ) .    on the algorithm side ,",
    "one of the next steps is to integrate other existing game solvers .",
    "foremost among these are the algorithms already implemented in gambit , which should be easily incorporated via their existing file formats for input and output .",
    "these include ( see mckelvey , mclennan , and turocy , 2010 ) algorithms for finding nash equilibria of more than two players with polynomial systems of equations , or via iterated polymatrix approximation ( govindan and wilson , 2004 ) , or simplicial subdivision ( van der laan , talman , and van der heyden , 1987 ) , and the recent implementation of `` action - graph games '' ( jiang , leyton - brown , and bhat , 2011 ) . moreover , larger games should not be created manually but automatically .",
    "one focus of the current development of gambit is to provide better facilities for the automatic generation of games using the python programming language .",
    "so far , the focus of gte development has been to design a robust and attractive graphical `` front end '' for creating and manipulating games .",
    "such an implementation does not count as scholarly research , so it is difficult to fund it directly with a research grant , or to let a phd student invest a lot of time in it . as a topic for an msc thesis or undergraduate programming project ,",
    "usually too much time is needed to become familiar with the existing code or the necessary background in game theory .",
    "the gambit project and gte were sponsored by studentships from the `` google summer of code '' in 2011 and 2012 . here , the most successful projects for gte were those where the students could bring in their technical expertise on web graphics , for example , to complement our background in game - theoretic algorithms .",
    "as with open - source software in general , the development of gte relies on the efforts , competence , and enthusiasm of volunteers , where we were lucky to get help from excellent students listed in the acknowledgments .",
