    "internet has evolved to become a large network where services will differ according to the user s need .",
    "internet can be used , as it first purpose was , to send mail or use the _ world wide web ( www)_. now , on - line gaming , audio or videao discussion are currently used on the internet .",
    "but all these new services require low delay for interactivity . due to the difficulty of using news transport protocols",
    ", these news services continue to use _ transmission control protocol ( tcp)_. this transport protocol is very sensitive to the variation of the delay .",
    "there are some geographic areas where the delay is higher than usual . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors have shown that reunion island has a specific behavior in terms of routing and delay . in this paper",
    ", we would investigate the impact of these characteristics on the performance of tcp .",
    "after a selection of specific metrics , we have collected a total of 72 gigabytes of data by passive metrology during one month using a listener .",
    "the analysis of the files revealed two evidences :    1 .",
    "up of 78% of the traffic is going outside of the island .",
    "there is a strong presence of tcp in collected traffic .",
    "one most interesting finding is that https take near half of the service used by tcp .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the section  [ sec : description ] explains the specific context of physical connectivity of reunion island . a description of the suitable metrics to analyze tcp traffic",
    "have been determined in the section  [ sec : metrics ] , whereas the section  [ sec : tools ] presents the tools used to capture and to analyze tcp traces .",
    "the section  [ sec : methodo ] presents the methodology to collect traffic .",
    "collected traffic is analyzed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we complete the paper with the overview of related work in section  [ sec : related ] and our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "reunion island is a french overseas department located far away from france : in the indian ocean , between madagascar and mauritius . on the map  [ map : cables ]",
    ", we can see that reunion island is connected to the internet by two submarine cables .",
    "the first one is the _ south africa far east ( safe ) _ spans from asia ( india and malaysia ) to south africa .",
    "the safe is extended by the sat3-wasc ( _ south africa transit 3/west africa submarine cable _ ) cable which connected west africa to europe . the  _ lower indian ocean network ( lion ) _ and lion2 cables connect , as its name indicates , the lower part of the indian ocean to a range of submarine cables in east africa .",
    "this means that reunion island is connected to four landing points namely west africa and europe , east africa and asia .",
    "the author of  @xcite compared the internet latency observed from reunion island and paris .",
    "the figures  [ curve:2012 ] and  [ curve:2016 ] represents the _ probability density function ( pdf ) _ of the _ round - trip time ( rtt)_. the rtt was evaluated with the ` ping ` command on a sample of ipv4 addresses distributed over the world . the first part colored in blue in  [ curve : ping ] represents the density probability for delay from reunion island , while the red depicts the pdf from paris . on the first figure ,",
    "the two curves have the same trend with a @xmath2 shift . to get a better comparison ,",
    "we have updated this result with one new experiment . the figure  [ curve:2016 ] shown the updated results .",
    "the red curve shows a shorter delay than before , while the minimal delay from reunion island has increased . the delay from reunion island was smooth through time between the two experiments .",
    "this is one reason why we will study the impact of this specific connectivity on the transport protocol performance .",
    "in this section , we would describe each metric we have chosen to analyze tcp traffic .",
    "we have split the metrics in two categories : supervision and performance .      in this class of metrics",
    ", we would only have a view of the traffic exchange , as an isp could have .",
    "the first concern is the volume exchanged with ipv4 protocol . in this volume",
    ", we would make a distinction in terms of destination .",
    "we divide the collected traffic in 3 categories :    1 .",
    "the first one is traffic in _ local area network ( lan ) _ and concerned only traffic inside the intranet of collected points . 2 .   the second one can be associated to traffic in",
    "_ metropolitan area network ( man)_. with the presence of an _ internet exchange point ( ixp ) _ , we will , in this case , consider traffic intra - reunion island .",
    "3 .   the last case is _ wide area network ( wan ) _ traffic and identified traffic going outside of the island .",
    "the analyze of destinations included in the _ wan _ part would give us some indications about the location of the information needed by the user .",
    "our second metric we have focused on is the traffic s volume of different _ protocols of transport _ , like tcp and udp .",
    "this would inform us of the most used protocol and if the services use the right protocol .",
    "lastly , the number of the _ destination ports _ will give us an overview of services that have been used .",
    "the tcp is the principal protocol of transport used around the world with heavy - dependence on delay . studying its performance is equivalent to study internet performance . in  @xcite",
    ", the author has explained the functioning of a system based on requests .",
    "the figure  [ fig : jain ] has been taken from his book .",
    "we used it for choosing which tcp metrics should be used .",
    "the first and the second metrics are the rtt and the throughput",
    ". some event could be easily identified , like packets losses and retransmits .",
    "+ we define a flow as a bi - directional series of ip packet with the same source and destination address , port number and protocol number .",
    "the table  [ table : metrics ] resume all the metrics choose for the experiment .",
    ".metric summary [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     we can see that the percent of packets retransmits or losses are like crumbs , with less than 1% .",
    "the percent of these errors are less than tcp could produce in normal condition .",
    "a description of cuba internet s connectivity has been done in  @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that , despite a similar internet access than reunion island , cuba have an internet latency near to the general case .",
    "this general case was presented in  @xcite , where a relation between delay and geographical distance have been made .",
    "the authors of  @xcite have proved that reunion island is a specific case . in analyzing the internet performance of the african continent , several studies have been made . in 2001 ,",
    "@xcite have highlighted that the delay is very high and the http response very low in rural area of africa . in comparison with us ,",
    "their flows are less longer , with 60% of their traffic have a duration lower than 2 seconds .",
    "the presence of flow durations higher than 10 minutes is a little fraction ( 0.47% ) but are still present in the analyze .",
    "another study has been done in a rural area of the african continent , more specifically in zambia .",
    "the study has been done in 2005 by the author of  @xcite after an upgrade of the bandwidth .",
    "however , the meaning delay to reach services stayed higher than elsewhere .",
    "a recent research about the presence of services in africa has been explained in  @xcite .",
    "the author has explained that despite the presence of servers in the continent , most of the traffic continues to go to america .",
    "it is a very similar situation as in reunion island with france servers .",
    "making a campaign of passive metrology is the second step for a better knowledge of the reasons why the internet is degraded in some regions .",
    "reunion island has a specific connectivity to the internet , with two submarine cables and a routing rules which made that the majority of the traffic going through france .",
    "our study shows that up to 78% of the lim traffic is to wan and tcp is the most important transport protocol used in reunion island . studying its performance is important to identify the default of the reunion island connectivity but the filter set up by the university impact our results .",
    "the analysis shows that the feeling of slowness did nt come from the performance of tcp but only due to the delay and the routing rules . in the future",
    ", we will contact the isp working on reunion island and try to make an analysis of tcp performance of the isl .",
    "in addition to the performance , we will supervise reunion island s internet .",
    "we would also try to exchange information with the isp present in the indian ocean countries , like madagascar , mauritius or seychelles to make a comparison in the region ."
