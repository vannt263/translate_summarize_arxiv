    "hyperbolic metamaterials ( hmms ) , also known as indefinite media , enjoy a great deal of attention owing to their unique hyperbolic dispersion relations  @xcite , with associated high - wavenumber propagating waves without upper limit .",
    "this leads to numerous applications , such as enhanced - light interactions  @xcite , subwavelength imaging  @xcite , negative refraction  @xcite , and low - loss fiber cladding  @xcite .",
    "the hmms are usually artificially made by periodic dielectric - metal structures , such as a 1d dielectric - metal bragg grating .",
    "to describe the optical properties of the hmms , it is common to employ the local - response approximation ( lra ) , _ i.e. _ with every location @xmath0 in the structure a certain value for the permittivity @xmath1 is associated . in the lra , the effective material parameters of hmms have been thoroughly studied  @xcite .",
    "thanks to advances in nanofabrication , we witness a miniaturization of the feature size of metamaterials towards the deep nanoscale .",
    "the lra becomes more inaccurate , since the nonlocal response of free electrons starts to play a role  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the nonlocal response causes a blueshift of the surface plasmon ( sp ) resonance of the metallic particle  @xcite , and limits the sp field enhancement that in the lra sometimes diverges  @xcite .",
    "we employ a simple generalization to the lra , namely the hydrodynamic drude model ( hdm )  @xcite , which takes the nonlocal response into account .",
    "new in this model , as compared to the lra , are longitudinal waves with sub - nanometer wavelengths , besides the usual transverse waves .",
    "incidentally , some hmms have been found to exhibit strong effective ` nonlocal response ' , even in studies that employ the local - response approximation  @xcite .",
    "what is meant here is that the hmms , when considered as scatterers , can not be described in the single - scattering born approximation .",
    "this differs from the ( material ) nonlocal response of hmms that we consider here and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where already the scattering _ potentials _ associated with the metal constituents are nonlocal .",
    "we recently showed that material nonlocal response plays an important role on hmms in the limit of vanishing unit - cell size  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the nonlocal response gives rise to a cutoff to the hyperbolic dispersion curve , and an associated finite but very large fundamental upper limit to the enhanced local optical density of states ( ldos ) , which in the lra is known to diverge in the limit of vanishingly small unit cells .",
    "now in realized hmms , it is predominantly the finite size of the unit cell that keeps the ldos finite .",
    "so it is an intriguing question , not explored yet as far as we know , whether nonlocal response can also have noticeable effects in state - of - the - art hmms .",
    "this theoretical paper describes our search for observable nonlocal effects in hmms with unit cells much smaller than an optical wavelength , but much larger than the wavelength of hydrodynamic longitudinal pressure waves .",
    "as the hmm we consider a 1d subwavelength dielectric - metal bragg grating , with a unit cell of thickness @xmath2 , and thicknesses @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the dielectric and metal layers , respectively .",
    "the permittivity of the dielectric layer is @xmath5 .",
    "the metal is described in the hdm as a free - electron plasma with  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the drude permittivity for the transverse electric fields as in the lra , while the wavevector dependence of the permittivity @xmath8 of the longitudinal electric fields is responsible for the nonlocal response .",
    "we apply the hydrodynamic generalization of the common transfer - matrix method for layered systems  @xcite , and obtain the exact dispersion equation of the hmm @xmath9 + \\frac{{k_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\parallel}({w_d } - { w_m})}}{{{z_d}}}\\sin { \\theta _ d}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\,&(1 - \\cos { \\theta _ m}\\cos { \\theta _ l})-\\frac{1}{2}\\big[\\frac{k_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\parallel}^2}{k_{{\\scriptscriptstyle \\bot}{\\rm m}}^{\\rm l}}\\frac{{{}{{({w_d } - { w_m})}^2}}}{{{z_d}{z_m } } } + k_{{\\scriptscriptstyle \\bot}{\\rm m}}^{\\rm l}\\left(\\tfrac{{{z_d}}}{{{z_m } } } + \\tfrac{{{z_m}}}{{{z_d}}}\\right)\\big]\\sin { \\theta _ m}\\sin { \\theta _ l}\\big\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\,&{\\big[k_{{\\scriptscriptstyle \\bot } { \\rm m}}^{\\rm l}\\sin { \\theta _ l } - k_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\parallel}\\frac{{({w_d } - { w_m})}}{{{z_m}}}\\sin { \\theta _ m}\\big]^ { - 1}},\\label{exact_dispersion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for convenience we introduced the dimensionless parameters    @xmath10    and where @xmath11 represents the bloch wavevector in the direction of the periodicity , @xmath12 the wavevector along the layers , and @xmath13 the free - space wavevector .",
    "we also introduced the derived wavevectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we note that solving the hydrodynamic drude model requires boundary conditions in addition to the usual maxwell boundary conditions .",

    "as stated before , we consider sub - wavelength unit cells much smaller than optical wavelengths , but with metal layers much larger than the wavelengths of their longitudinal pressure waves .",

    "@xcite on this point . in the following",
    "we will keep the first ( _ i.e. _ the nonlocal ) correction term , while neglecting the other correction term @xmath33 .",
    "the sole justification for doing so is that the second term turns out to be negligible in comparison to the first one for the hmms that we consider , as we illustrate numerically below .",
    "so , as an improved approximation to eq .",
    "( [ approx_dispersion2 ] ) , we keep the correction term concerning @xmath34 , and then obtain the approximate nonlocal dispersion relation that is central to our present study , @xmath35 in terms of the new effective permittivity in the direction of the periodicity corrected by the nonlocal response @xmath36 the other tensor component @xmath26 of the dielectric tensor has no such nonlocal correction .    since @xmath37 , we usually have @xmath38 , and then @xmath39 is a good approximation .",

    "this is achieved when @xmath48 , which happens at the frequency @xmath49 at this frequency @xmath50 , the nonlocal response changes the finite @xmath27 into the infinite @xmath51 , again a strong nonlocal effect .    from the above analysis",
    ", it follows that nonlocal response is important for hmms near the frequencies @xmath45 and @xmath50 , as also evidenced numerically in the next section .",

    "a hmm slab can operate as a superlens with subwavelength resolution , since the hyperbolic dispersion curve supports propagating waves with arbitrarily high wavevectors , which can transfer the evanescent information of the object . in the lra",
    ", it is known that the hmm with its flat dispersion curve at @xmath45 [ recall fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] is especially favorable for subwavelength imaging  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the flat dispersion curve with the constant @xmath82 ensures that all plane - wave components experience the same phase changes after transmission through the hmm slab , at least if reflections can be neglected .",
    "actually , the reflections can be suppressed by appropriate choice of the thickness @xmath83 of the hmm lens , and even be made to vanish by choosing @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a positive integer . in theory",

    "let us now investigate how nonlocal response may influence the subwavelength imaging characteristics of the hmm lens . as demonstrated in the above sections , the nonlocal response sets the infinite @xmath87 to a finite value and accordingly destroys the desired flat dispersion curve at the frequency @xmath45 where one would normally choose to operate for perfect imaging , based on the lra .",
    "nevertheless , at a blueshifted frequency @xmath50 , the local effective dielectric function @xmath27 may be finite , but the hydrodynamic drude model predicts instead that @xmath51 diverges , with the concomitant flat dispersion curve suitable for subwavelength imaging .",

    "the reflection is nearly zero since @xmath100 , so all wave components experience the same phase change . accordingly , after propagation through the hmm from @xmath89 to @xmath86 , a subwavelength image is formed near @xmath86 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a1 ) .",
    "by contrast , in the nonlocal case the dispersion curve turns into an ellipse .",
