    "in the last years the field of topological states of matter has been subject to stunning progress following the theoretical prediction  @xcite and experimental observation  @xcite of topological insulators .",

    "this model requires an intricate magnetic flux pattern as provided by a complex second - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath0 averaging to zero over the unit cell and breaking time - reversal symmetry .",

    "recent elaborate studies in terms of exact diagonalization@xcite , infinite density matrix renormalization group@xcite have addressed the stability of the qah ground state upon inclusion of quantum fluctuations .",
    "these studies have found an intricate competition of various phases in the plane of nearest- and second - nearest - neighbor interactions including , e.g. , a conventional charge density wave state and a kekul dimerization pattern@xcite . in the regime where the topological mott insulating qah state was expected , a charge - modulated ( cm ) density wave phase has been found to be the ground state in refs .  .",
    "the qah state , on the other hand , is completely expelled from the quantum phase diagram .",
    "note , that numerical evidence for the persistence of the qah state has been presented in ref .  .",
    "further support for the scenario where the qah is suppressed in the model s phase diagram has been contributed by means of the functional renormalization group within a high - definition resolution of the momentum dependence of the interaction vertex in our ref .  .",
    "by now , the spinless model has been investigated in great detail by analytical and numerically exact methods . at the same time , the physically relevant spin-1/2 case remained elusive to studies operating at the same level of accuracy which can be attributed to the great amount of numerical effort that would be required , e.g. by exact diagonalization techniques .",
    "further , in the spinless as well as in the spin-1/2 case , an analysis of the problem by means of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches is typically inhibited by the fermion sign problem .",
    "on the other hand , recent qmc studies@xcite have also taken into account non - local density - density interactions on the honeycomb lattice , however , a definite statement about the quantum many - body ground state in the presence of sizable second - nearest neighbor interactions is hindered by limitations on the accessible parameter range .    in the spin-1/2 case ,",
    "a cousin of the qah state on the honeycomb  the quantum spin hall state  emerges from an intrinsic spin - orbit coupling as suggested by kane and mele@xcite in the context of a graphene model .",
    "the qsh basically corresponds to two copies of the haldane model with opposite chirality for the two spin projections and is symmetric under time reversal . also here , a next - nearest neighbor repulsion @xmath1 was argued to potentially trigger a phase transition towards the topologically non - trivial qsh state@xcite . a qualitative difference to the spinless case",
    ", however , is the possibility of a local interaction term , i.e. , the onsite repulsion @xmath2 , that can in principle affect the balance of the different fluctuations in the particle - hole channel .    in this work ,",
    "we address the role of the qsh state in the phase diagram of spin-1/2 fermions on the half - filled honeycomb lattice , and in particular , whether the onsite repulsion can drive an instability towards the qsh state through the additional energy penalty of charge imbalance throughout the lattice , as it occurs in the cm state . to that end",
    ", we implement the refined multi - patch rg scheme as established in ref .   for the spinless case where it supported the absence of a topological qah state in the phase diagram .",
    "we find that the unbiased inclusion of fermionic fluctuations of the spin-1/2 fermions exhibits a cm density wave phase with finite wavevector transfer as the leading instability for interaction strength @xmath1 larger than some critical value @xmath3 depending on the values of onsite and the nearest neighbor interactions .",

    "as the most singular part of this quantity comes from the zero matsubara frequency and we are interested in instabilities , we will also neglect the frequency dependence in the following .",

    "we studied interacting spin-1/2 fermions on the honeycomb lattice with repulsive onsite , nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions via the functional renormalization group ( frg ) for correlated fermions with a focus on the detection of a possible interaction - driven topological quantum spin hall state .",
    "this was motivated through recent studies of interacting spinless fermions by means of exact diagonalization , the infinite density matrix renormalization group and the frg that supported the suppression of a topological mott insulating phase in the whole phase diagram of interaction parameters .",
    "based on the findings in ref .  , we used a refined multi - patch rg scheme where fluctuations further from the fermi surface are considered to overcome the residual influence of an insufficient wavevector dependence on the leading instability in the renormalization group flow .    here , we complemented these previous studies by investigating the physically relevant case of spin-1/2 fermions additionally featuring onsite interactions which can potentially have an enhancing effect on the correlations in the spin channel supporting the topological qsh state .",
    "for dominating next - nearest neighbor interactions , however , our frg results favor ordering tendencies towards a charge - modulated ground state over the topological mott insulating state in agreement with the spinless case .",
    "further , our results are in qualitative agreement with a recent related frg study@xcite concerning the absence of the topological mott insulator state in the phase diagram and the appearance of charge - modulated states in the large @xmath1 regime . on the other hand , we do not find any sign for an incommensurable charge - modulated state reported in ref .  .",
    "this would require a much higher wavevector resolution .",
    "this is beyond the applicability of the present multi - patch approach as it requires a much higher numerical cost .    to summarize , an independent variation of the interaction parameters for the onsite , nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor repulsions does not reveal any spot in the tentative weak - coupling phase diagram , where the interaction - driven qsh state represents the leading instability .",
    "also , for interaction profiles inspired by ab initio parameters for graphene no indication for an topological mott insulator state is found .",
    "instead , we identified large parts of the phase diagram where a charge - modulated density wave order is the leading instability and we have found evidence for a competition between the spin correlations and the charge correlations .
