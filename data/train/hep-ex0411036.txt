    "although known as a @xmath4-factory , the asymmetric storage ring kekb enables the belle detector to explore the charm sector .",
    "charmed hadrons are not only the dominant decay product of @xmath5 flavoured mesons , but , in addition , the decay kinematics give valuable constraints allowing the detection of previously unobserved particles and the determination of their quantum numbers .    due to the excellent performance of the kekb accelerator ,",
    "the data sample available for charm studies at belle is unprecedented .",
    "over a year ago , kekb reached its design luminosity of @xmath6 and since then shifted its instantaneous peak luminosity to 13.92@xmath7 . until july 2004 ,",
    "belle accumulated a total integrated luminosity of about 287  @xmath8 .",
    "about 257  @xmath8  was recorded at the @xmath9  resonance , with the largest part of the remaining 29 @xmath8  about 60 mev  below the resonance . in the following a few recent results from the belle collaboration based on smaller data sets",
    "are presented , see @xcite and references therein for more details on the analyses .",
    "in decays of @xmath1 mesons , the @xmath10 transition is of great importance due to the ckm matrix elements involved .",
    "both vertices of the exchanged @xmath11 boson carry the largest possible matrix elements for this decay .",
    "so , final states with double charm and charmonium states can be produced to a vast amount .",
    "for charmonium , @xmath1 decays turn out to be a complementary testing field to the production of these states in @xmath3  annihilation at lower energies .    in general ,",
    "two variables are commonly used for selecting fully reconstructed @xmath1 candidates , i.e. candidates which while decay chain has been completely identified and reconstructed .",
    "both make use of the fact that at this center - of - mass energy ( cme ) , both @xmath1 mesons are produced back - to - back with a well known energy , @xmath12 .",
    "one is the beam constrained mass @xmath13 , where for the invariant mass of the @xmath1 candidate , the energy of the candidate is replaced by the well known the other one is the energy difference @xmath14 between @xmath15 and the energy of the @xmath1 candidate .",
    "selecting @xmath16 decays by requiring @xmath13  of the @xmath1 candidate to be within @xmath17 and the energy difference @xmath18  to be within @xmath19 , a clear peak at around @xmath20 in the mass difference between the @xmath21  plus the @xmath22  system and the @xmath21  can be identified with the @xmath23 .",
    "a second peak about 170  @xmath24  higher than the one from the @xmath23 can be seen .",
    "mc studies showed that this could not be produced by e.g. reflections of any known particle , see fig .",
    "[ fig : xdiscover ] .",
    "it has therefore been attributed to a new particle , dubbed the x(3872 ) , as it s measured mass is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it s resolution has been determined to be less than the detector resolution for this channel of @xmath26 .",
    "the product branching ratio for @xmath27 has been determined to @xmath28 .",
    "its large value suggests that the discovery channel is one of the , if not the dominant decay channel of the @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath22  system and the @xmath21  itself .",
    "the large peak at @xmath20 is due to the decay of the @xmath23 .",
    "the second , smaller peak at @xmath30 can not be explained by any known particle and has been attributed to a new particle , called the @xmath29.,scaledwidth=42.5% ]    subsequently , the @xmath29  was confirmed by cdf@xcite , d0@xcite and babar@xcite .",
    "below , the mass and width measurements of the @xmath29  for all four experiments are listed , together with its weighted average calculated from the first three experiments only as the babar result quotes only a total uncertainty .",
    "the d0 measurement has been transformed from @xmath31 to @xmath32 using the current world average of @xmath33 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "over the last years , the @xmath5-factories made several new unexpected discoveries , mostly involving charmed mesons .",
    "an apparent charmonium state , the @xmath29 , does not fit at all into the charmonium spectrum .",
    "it might represent a new form of matter , a molecule build out of mesons .",
    "other new discovered particles in the @xmath34 system behave like expected , however , their masses are significantly too low . and last , but not least , the production cross section of double charmonium in @xmath3  annihilation is still about an order of magnitude larger than predicted by theory .",
