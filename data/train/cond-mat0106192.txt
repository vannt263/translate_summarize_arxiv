    "extending the novel approach by kramers @xcite for polymeric solutions under shear ( based on replacing the simple shear flow by its irrotational part ) @xcite to melts allows us to compute a characteristic time @xmath0 related to the melt viscosity.@xcite in ref .",
    "5 the method was applied to alkane chains up to about 50 carbon atoms . in this note",
    "we compare this concept for melts with calculations of characteristic times for the end - to - end relaxation of chains ( rotational time @xmath1 ) and a time @xmath2 obtained from the center of mass diffusion .",
    "this is achieved by monte carlo simulations for dense systems of self  avoiding lattice chains on a simple  cubic lattice .",
    "chains up to a length @xmath4 are considered , which near the upper limit already indicate the onset of entanglements .",
    "our calculations show that there exists an intermediate range of chain lengths @xmath3 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 agree in their dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "this confirms the conclusion that important information on the melt viscosity as a function of @xmath3 can be drawn from knowledge of fourth and sixth moments of the equilibrium distribution function for beads of the chain . in the next section",
    "we describe our lattice model , followed in section iii by the description of our relaxation time results .",
    "we model the self  avoiding polymer by athermal lattice chains where every point of a simple cubic lattice with unit spacing is allowed to be occupied by at most one chain monomer . in this way",
    "the hard - core repulsion is taken into account .",
    "for the dynamics and for the equilibration of our system we use the generalized verdier - algorithm , @xcite consisting of local moves of one or two monomers .",
    "this allows us to determine the center of mass coordinates , the center of mass diffusion constant and the end to end distance as a function of monte - carlo time steps , for a number of chain densities .",
    "the average chain densities are measured by the number of monomers per lattice point .",
    "we investigate monomer densities @xmath5 ranging from a single chain up to @xmath6 ( half filled lattice ) .    in ref .",
    "2 it was shown that a relaxation time @xmath0 can be obtained from the kramers potential @xcite for rouse chains in a simple shear flow .",
    "this time is obtained from the equilibrium averaged fourth and sixth moments of chain monomer coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 relative to the center of mass .",
    "if @xmath9 is the mean squared x  component of the radius of gyration of the chain at equilibrium , then @xcite    @xmath10 \\label{eq:1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the coordinates of the chain monomers with respect to the center of mass of a chain . in the rouse model one",
    "can calculate the shear viscosity @xmath11 from this relaxation time using @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass density , @xmath14 is avogadro s number , @xmath15 the molar mass of the molecule and @xmath16 either the rouse or the reduced kramers time given by ( [ eq:1 ] ) . with @xmath16",
    "equal to the reduced kramers time @xmath0 , eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] was shown earlier@xcite to give the melt ( shear ) viscosity of shorter alkanes up to about 50 @xmath17 units . in this note",
    "we do not obtain @xmath11 directly but we calculate and compare @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 as a function of chain length @xmath3 at various monomer densities . while @xmath0 is calculated from ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath1 by fitting an exponential to the decay of the end - to - end vector correlation function at large times .",
    "the time @xmath18 is obtained from simulated center of mass diffusion coefficients d and the mean square radius of gyration @xmath19 .",
    "as a background to our further results we show in fig .  1a plot of the diffusion constants @xmath20 divided by the rouse diffusion coefficient @xmath21 for various densities . here",
    "the factor @xmath22 has been introduced to account for the average effect of blocking of sites by other monomers . the drop in @xmath23 for sufficiently large @xmath3 , seen in fig .  1 , can be thought to herald the onset of reptation .",
    "the horizontal line represents the expected @xmath3-dependences of the free chain while the line with slope @xmath24 reflects the expected behavior for reptating chains .",
    "the inset provides an approximate master curve for the diffusion constant versus @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an estimated length for the onset of entanglements.@xcite fig .",
    "2 presents double ",
    "logarithmic plots of the various relaxation times against @xmath3 for three different densities . naturally , for short chains one would nt expect any universal properties so that differences in the behaviors of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not surprising . in the dilute limit , displayed in fig .  2a ,",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 grow with @xmath3 approximately as @xmath27 when @xmath28 , in reasonable agreement with earlier numerical studies.@xcite for the purpose of illustrating this @xmath3dependence common to @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have multiplied @xmath0 by a constant factor so that both sets of data fall on a common curve .",
    "the associated effective exponent in this range of @xmath3values is in fair agreement with the theoretical expectation @xmath29 ( see ref .  11 ) with @xmath30 . for comparison ,",
    "data for @xmath31 are also shown in fig .",
    "on the other hand , with @xmath32 for unentangled chains , it is clear that @xmath2 will also be proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "a different behavior is observed in fig .",
    "2b for a monomer density @xmath34 .",
    "apart from a constant numerical factor , the relaxation times @xmath0 and @xmath1 fall together in the range @xmath35 . deviations beyond @xmath36 are expected to be caused by entanglement effects which then are no longer negligible and are not included in the kramers method .",
    "note that for large @xmath3 sufficiently above the entanglement length one expects @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the effective dynamic exponent read from the slope of the straight line in fig .",
    "2b in principle may depend on @xmath5 ( see ref .",
    "10 ) but , similar to fig .",
    "2a , is still found in fair agreement with @xmath39 . on the other hand , screening effects now diminish the growth of @xmath40 with @xmath3 relative to the case of a free chain shown in fig .",
    "2a . the stronger increase of @xmath2 with @xmath3 becomes clear from the behavior of @xmath20 , see fig .  1 .",
    "these trends with @xmath5 are continued in fig .",
    "2c where the range of agreement between @xmath0 and @xmath1 shrinks to about @xmath41 .",
    "2c also suggests that for @xmath3 substantially larger than @xmath26 @xmath0 , assumes again rouse - like scaling behavior , i.e. @xmath42 .    in passing , we note that for the ratio of the square of the end - to - end distance @xmath43 to the squared radius of gyration @xmath44 saturates with @xmath3 and comes close to the value 6 for our higher densities , as expected for gaussian chains , whereas for lower densities this ratio is significantly larger than 6 .",
    "this ratio versus @xmath3 is plotted in fig .",
    "the kramers potential approach for the viscosity relaxation time of dense systems of lattice chains has been verified numerically for an intermediate range of chain lengths . for longer chains the breakdown of this concept",
    "could be identified as a result of the onset of entanglement effects .",
    "generally , the kramers approach offers the possibility to obtain information on a dynamic quantity from equilibrium data .",
    "equilibrium lattice chain configurations can be generated very efficiently via the configurational bias method.@xcite from such data the static moments in eq .",
    "1 and hence information about melt viscosities in a certain range of densities and chain lengths can be obtained with minimal computational effort .",
