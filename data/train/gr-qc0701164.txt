    "one of the major goals of numerical relativity has been the accurate evolution of generic black - hole binaries from inspiral through merger and ringdown .",
    "it is in this non - linear merger regime where most of the gravitational radiation is emitted , including the radiation of linear momentum responsible for large merger recoils that can eject the remnant from the host galaxy . with the recent breakthroughs in numerical techniques  @xcite this goal is finally being realized . within the past 18 months",
    "rapid progress has been achieved in our understanding of black - hole - binary mergers .",
    "non - spinning equal - mass binaries were studied in detail , including the last few orbits  @xcite , the effects of elliptical motion  @xcite on the gravitational radiation , and waveforms generated from binaries with large initial separations were successfully matched to post - newtonian theory with very good agreement  @xcite .",
    "non - spinning unequal mass black holes were studied in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , where the recoil velocity of the post - merger remnant was computed . in particular , the accurate calculations of  @xcite indicate that the maximum recoil velocity of non - spinning quasi - circular binaries , with mass ratio @xmath9 , is @xmath10 .",
    "simulations of highly - spinning black - hole binaries were introduced in  @xcite where it was shown that the direction of the spin ( in that case either aligned or counter - aligned with the orbital angular momentum ) has a strong effect on the merger time and energy - momentum radiated to infinity . in  @xcite it was found that the non - linear tidal effects were too weak to drive a binary into a corotating state .",
    "finally in  @xcite spin precession and spin - flips were studied for equal - mass binaries with individual spins not aligned with the orbital angular momentum ( but with individual spins having the same magnitude and direction ) .",
    "all the previous simulations contained symmetries which suppressed some important astrophysical properties ( e.g.  precession , recoil , spin - orbit coupling ) of generic binary mergers , and in the case of the recoil calculation , spins were neglected entirely . with the knowledge gained from these simulations we can now design and evolve a truly prototypical black - hole binary . in the scenario considered here , a high - mass black hole , with a specific spin of @xmath11 (",
    "the largest considered thus far ) , merges with a smaller hole having negligible spin .",
    "the mass ratio of the two holes is @xmath12 , and the initial binary configuration is such that the spin of the larger hole points @xmath13 below the orbital plane .",
    "this configuration will manifest precession of the spin axis , a significant spin flip of the remnant spin with respect to the initial individual horizon spin , and a significant recoil kick .",
    "the simulations that we report in this letter show that the recoil due to the spin can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the maximum recoil due to unequal - masses alone .",
    "we use the puncture approach  @xcite along with the twopunctures  @xcite thorn to compute initial data .",
    "we evolve these black hole binary data sets using the lazev  @xcite implementation of the moving puncture approach  @xcite ( which is based on the bssn  @xcite formulation ) .",
    "we use the carpet  @xcite mesh refinement driver to provide a ` moving boxes ' style mesh refinement . in this approach refined grids of fixed size are arranged about the coordinate centers of both holes .",
    "the carpet code then moves these fine grids about the computational domain by following the trajectories of the two black holes .",
    "we measure the horizon spin ( magnitude and direction ) using the techniques detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the initial data parameters for our sp6 configuration ( i.e.  generic binary configuration ) , which were obtained using the 3pn equations of motion , are given in table  [ table : spnid ] .",
    "note that the binary has a small inward radial velocity ( that we obtain from the post - newtonian inspiral . )",
    "the initial orbital plane coincides with the @xmath14 plane .",
    ".initial data parameters for the sp6 ( top ) and sp2 ( bottom ) configurations .",
    "@xmath15 is the puncture mass parameter of the two holes .",
    "sp6 has spins @xmath16 and @xmath17 , momenta @xmath18 , puncture positions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 . while sp2 has spins @xmath23 , puncture positions @xmath24 , and momenta @xmath25 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ table : spnid ]    we tested our code with mesh refinement by evolving the sp3 configuration of  @xcite . for this test",
    "we evolved sp3 with three different grid configuration with finest resolutions of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 respectively , and 6 levels of refinement .",
    "we placed the refinement boundaries at the same coordinate distance from the punctures for each configuration .",
    "we confirmed that the waveforms converge to fourth order and agree with our unigrid sp3 evolution .",
    "we ran the sp6 run with 7 levels of refinement , with a finest resolution of @xmath29 .",
    "the outer boundaries were placed at @xmath30 .",
    "we tracked the individual horizon spins throughout the evolution and found no significant spin - up of the smaller ( initially non - spinning ) hole ( the value of @xmath31 at merger was @xmath32 ) .",
    "the larger black hole , on the other hand , showed a significant @xmath13 angle of spin - precession , with final spin ( at merger ) @xmath33 . during the evolution the binary performed @xmath34 orbits prior to the formation of the common apparent horizon ( cah ) .",
    "the first common horizon was detected at @xmath35 .",
    "the common horizon had mass @xmath36 indicating that @xmath37 of the mass was converted into gravitational radiation .",
    "the spin of the remnant horizon was @xmath38 .",
    "the adm angular momentum for this system is @xmath39 , thus we predict that the radiated angular momentum is @xmath40 .",
    "the measured radiated mass and angular momentum , based on the @xmath41 through @xmath42 modes of @xmath43 were @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which agree well with the remnant horizon parameters . note that the agreement in @xmath46 between the horizon spin and radiation calculation indicates that our method for calculating the spin direction is reasonably accurate for our choice of coordinates .",
    "the final horizon spin is flipped by @xmath5 with respect to the initial spin of the larger individual horizon and @xmath47 with respect to the initial orbital angular momentum .",
    "the remnant hole acquires a significant recoil velocity of @xmath48 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : recoilvelocities ] ) , which makes an angle of @xmath49 with respect to the initial orbital angular momentum and @xmath50 with respect to the initial spin .",
    "we measured this kick by calculating the radiated linear momentum  @xcite based on the @xmath41 through @xmath42 modes of @xmath43 .",
    "we extracted these modes at @xmath51 and then extrapolated the radiated momenta calculated at these radii to @xmath52 using a linear ( least - squares ) fit ( we excluded the initial data burst from this momentum calculation ) .",
    "the quoted errors in @xmath53 are the differences between the linear extrapolation and a quadratic extrapolation .",
    "this recoil velocity of @xmath54 is more than double the maximum recoil velocity found for non - spinning holes  @xcite even including small eccentricity effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin - induced recoil in the @xmath14 plane might be offset by the mass - difference - induced recoil , potentially implying that a rotation of the spin about the @xmath55-axis may lead to a significantly larger in - plane component of the recoil velocity .",
    "further study will be needed to determine if the mass - difference - induced recoil is ( partially ) aligned or counter - aligned with the spin - induced recoil .    .",

    "we studied , for the first time using fully non - linear numerical relativity , a realistic astrophysical configuration of unequal mass , spinning black holes starting from a slightly elliptical orbit , with radial inward velocity as predicted by post - newtonian theory , for large initial separations .",
    "our main new result is that the spin component to the recoil velocity may produce the leading contribution .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that the @xmath55-component of the recoil velocity , which is not present for non - spinning binaries , is the dominant component .",
    "this also can be seen from the 2nd post - newtonian expressions for the radiated linear momentum  @xcite @xmath56 \\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and an overdot denotes @xmath64 .    based on this expression we can predict that the maximum recoil velocity is reached for equal mass black holes with opposite ( and maximal ) spins lying on the orbital plane since all four terms add constructively to the radiated momentum .",
    "we performed one additional run , denoted by sp2 , with anti - aligned spins of magnitude @xmath65 lying initially along the y - axis as reported in table  [ table : spnid ] .",
    "we obtain a @xmath66 . by rescaling this to maximal spins we obtain essentially double those values raising the maximum recoil of spinning holes to almost @xmath67 .",
    "equation  ( [ pnpdot ] ) also allows us to propose an empirical formula for the total recoil velocities ] @xmath68 where @xmath69 , the index @xmath70 and @xmath71 refer to perpendicular and parallel to the orbital angular momentum respectively , @xmath72 are orthogonal unit vectors in the orbital plane and @xmath73 measures the angle between the unequal mass and spin contribution to the recoil velocity in the orbital plane . the constants @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be determined from newly available runs .",
    "the angle @xmath76 is defined as the angle between the in - plane component of @xmath77 and the infall direction at merger .",
    "we have confirmed this @xmath78 dependence by evolving a set of runs similar to sp2 but with initial spins rotated by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting kicks were well modeled by a @xmath82 dependence , with @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "note that we measured a maximum kick of @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and a minimum kick of @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "this will be the subject of an upcoming paper by the authors .",
    "the total recoil velocity also acquires a correction  @xcite for small eccentricities , @xmath89 , of the form @xmath90 .    from  @xcite @xmath91 and @xmath92 . from fits",
    "to @xcite and @xcite we find @xmath93 and from sp2 and  @xcite ( which appeared after this paper had been submitted ) we find @xmath94 respectively .",
    "note the sign difference showing some of the @xmath95 dependence on @xmath76 .",
    "the in - plane recoil velocity for our sp6 configuration is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ empirical ] ) with @xmath96 , however our simulation shows strong precession of the spin near merger , where a large fraction of the recoil velocity is built up , hence it is difficult to accurately determine the spin parameters @xmath97 and @xmath76 to be used in eq .",
    "( [ empirical ] ) .",
    "a number of arguments @xcite suggest that spins of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are close to maximal , @xmath98 , and perhaps as great as @xmath99 @xcite",
    ". mass ratios of binary smbhs are poorly constrained observationally , but the luminous galaxies known to harbor smbhs are believed to have experienced a few to several major mergers ( mass ratios @xmath100 ) over their lifetimes @xcite ; mergers with @xmath101 were more common in the past .",
    "together with the results discussed above , these arguments suggest that recoil velocities for binary smbhs in galactic nuclei are often of order @xmath102 . here",
    ", we consider some consequences of such large recoil velocities .    _",
    "ejection : _ central escape velocities from giant elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxy bulges are @xmath103 , dropping to @xmath104 in dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies @xcite",
    ". recoil velocities as large as @xmath105 would easily eject smbhs from de and dsph galaxies , and in fact there is little evidence for smbhs in these galaxies .",
    "however , we note that the mass dependence of spin - dominated kicks , @xmath106 , implies that recoil velocities might only infrequently be as large as in the equal - mass case .",
    "if the tight empirical relations between smbh mass and luminous galaxy properties @xcite are to be maintained , peak recoil velocities are constrained to be @xmath107 @xcite ; the upper limit on @xmath95 is relaxed if most of the merger - induced growth of smbhs took place at low redshifts ( @xmath108 ) when potential wells were deeper @xcite .",
    "ejection of smbhs from shallow potential wells at high redshift implies a maximum @xmath55 at which the progenitors of present - day smbhs could have started merging @xcite , and the existence of bright quasars at @xmath109 is difficult to reconcile with recoil velocities @xmath110 unless their smbhs grew very quickly via accretion @xcite .",
    "however we note that these and similar conclusions are based on an assumed mass ratio dependence for the kicks that is invalid if recoil velocities are dominated by spin effects .    _",
    "displacement : _ the long return time for a smbh ejected near escape velocity implies a substantial probability of finding a displaced smbh in a luminous e galaxy , especially if the latter was the site of a recent merger @xcite .",
    "a recoiling smbh carries with it material that was orbiting with velocity @xmath111 before the kick ; the size of the region containing this mass is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the smbh mass in units of @xmath114 and @xmath115 is the nuclear velocity dispersion in units of @xmath116 .",
    "this radius is sufficient to include the inner accretion disk and the broad - line region gas , implying that a kicked bh can continue shining for some time as a quasar .",
    "plausibility of models that explain the `` naked '' quasar he 0450 - 2958 as an ejected smbh @xcite are enhanced by the larger kick velocities found here , since @xmath117 from the nearby galaxy is @xmath118 ; however the presence of spectral features associated with narrow emission line region gas in the quasar is still difficult to reconcile with the recoil hypothesis @xcite .    _",
    "galaxy cores : _ the kinetic energy of a displaced smbh is transferred to the stars in a galactic nucleus via dynamical friction , lowering the stellar density and enlarging the core before the hole returns to its central location @xcite .",
    "`` damage '' to the core is maximized for @xmath119 @xcite , hence the effect could be large even in the brightest e galaxies .",
    "observed core masses are mostly in the range @xmath120 , consistent with the cores having been generated by binary smbhs without the help of kicks @xcite ; however a significant fraction have core masses exceeding @xmath121 suggesting an additional contribution from recoils .",
    "anomalously large cores in bcg s ( `` brightest cluster galaxies '' ) might be explained in this way , since these galaxies have experienced the largest number of mergers ; this explanation would lessen the necessity for alternatives that require bcgs to contain hypermassive bhs @xcite .    _ jet directions : _ we measure both a significant pre - merger spin precession of @xmath122 and a change in excess of @xmath123 between the initial and final spin vectors , verifying the spin - flip phenomenon first discussed by @xcite .",
    "thus , our simulation represents a possible model for the merger process responsible for generating radio sources with changing jet directions .",
    "in particular , the highly - spinning large mass black hole merging with the smaller mass non - spinning hole is a possible model for both the gradual semi - periodic deviations of the jet directions from a straight line  @xcite due to precession of the spin ( and hence jet ) direction , and the abrupt change in jet direction forming x - shaped patterns  .",
