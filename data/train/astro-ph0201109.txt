    "the earth s atmosphere is continuously bombarded by highly relativistic ionized particles , first discovered and named `` cosmic rays '' by v.  hess in 1912 . present ",
    "day experiments show the cosmic  ray energy spectrum extending up to more than @xmath0 ev . the flux spectrum follows a power law @xmath1 over many decades in energy .",
    "the most prominent feature is the _ knee _ in the spectrum around 3  pev where the spectrum steepens from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "the origin of cosmic rays is still under debate .",
    "strong , relativistic shock fronts expanding from supernova explosions are favoured by popular models for the acceleration of ionized particles .",
    "such models explain the particle acceleration up to energies of about @xmath4 ev , with the nuclear charge @xmath5 of the particle .",
    "this upper limit coincides for primary protons with the mentioned steepening of the spectrum , and the origin of the _ knee _ is related to the upper limit of acceleration in several models .",
    "since the charged particles are deflected in the interstellar magnetic fields , the only hint of their sources are their energy spectrum and the mass composition , or more preferable , the energy spectra of individual elements .",
    "cosmic rays at energies below 1  pev have been directly observed by balloon ",
    "borne instruments at the top of the atmosphere or in outer space . at higher energies",
    ", the steep falling flux spectrum requires large detection areas or long observation periods , presently only possible in ground  based installations .",
    "these detector systems measure the secondary particles produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere , the extensive air showers ( eas ) .    to investigate the cosmic rays from several @xmath6 ev up to @xmath7 ev the air shower experiment kascade ( `` karlsruhe shower core and array detector '' ) @xcite has been built on  site at the forschungszentrum karlsruhe in germany .",
    "the experiment detects the three main components of eas simultaneously",
    ". a @xmath8 m@xmath9 scintillator array measures the electromagnetic and muonic components .",
    "the 320 m@xmath9 central detector system combines a large hadron calorimeter @xcite with several muon detection systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , high energetic muons are measured by an underground muon tracking detector @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain the mass and energy of the shower  inducing particle , measured eas observables are compared with predictions of simulations .",
    "these simulations describe the development of an eas in the atmosphere and , thereafter , the signal response for all individual particles hitting the detectors . a critical part in the simulation chain is the model used to describe the high  energy hadronic interactions , since the model has to extrapolate into kinematical and energy regions not covered by present  day collider experiments .",
    "the karlsruhe eas simulation program corsika @xcite provides several high  energy hadronic interaction models  hdpm , dpmjet , nexus , qgsjet , sibyll , venus  based on different phenomenological descriptions . below 80  gev the codes gheisha and urqmd are available .",
    "one objective of the kascade experiment is to evaluate these models and to provide criteria for their improvement .",
    "the hadron calorimeter is a valuable detector for testing the interaction models .",
    "the structure of the hadronic component is examined in energy and spatial coordinates .",
    "observables used include the number of hadrons as well as their energy sum , their lateral distribution and their energy spectrum , the energy of each individual hadron relative to the most energetic hadron in an eas , the maximum hadron energy , and the spatial distribution of the hadrons .",
    "all observables are investigated as functions of the number of electrons and muons as well as of the hadronic energy sum .",
    "an example of such investigations is given in figure [ jens ] .",
    "shown are frequency distributions for the number of reconstructed hadrons above 50  gev and the hadronic energy sum for two shower size intervals for eas with shower core inside the calorimeter .",
    "kascade findings are compared with predictions of the models qgsjet , dpmjet , and nexus for two extreme mass scenarios , the primaries being only protons or iron nuclei @xcite . combining all observables , it turned out that the model qgsjet delivers the most reliable description @xcite .",
    "this model is used for the analyses described in the following sections .",
    "detailed investigations have been performed with the kascade data to study the influence of different observables and hadronic interaction models on the inferred cosmic  ray mass composition .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ rothlna ] . in a bayesian analysis @xcite , the mean logarithmic mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the relative abundance of elements with mass @xmath12 , is calculated for different combinations of observables .",
    "several electromagnetic , muonic , and hadronic observables have been used , including number of electrons @xmath13 and muons @xmath14 , number of hadrons above 100  gev @xmath15 , their energy sum @xmath16 , the maximum energy of a hadron per shower @xmath17 , the number of high energy muons ( @xmath18  gev ) @xmath19 , and their spatial distribution @xmath20 .",
    "the left graph summarizes results obtained including the electromagnetic shower size @xmath13 , whereas the results in the right panel are obtained without @xmath13 .",
    "the combinations including @xmath13 lead to smaller @xmath21 values as compared to those without .",
    "the total spread between the results is @xmath22 .",
    "similar systematic effects have been observed earlier for different hadronic observables @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies are most probably caused by inconsistencies in the hadronic interaction models used to interpret the eas data .",
    "several analysis methods have been carried out to obtain the cosmic  ray energy spectrum .",
    "the kascade data show a _ knee _ in the electromagnetic , muonic , and hadronic shower size spectra @xcite . from the size spectra ,",
    "the primary energy spectrum has been derived ( see e.g. @xcite ) , including the absolute flux spectrum obtained for the first time using hadronic observables @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite uses electromagnetic and muonic shower size spectra in three different zenith angle bins . with a four component assumption for the mass composition of primary cosmic rays ( protons , helium , cno - group , and iron group ) ,",
    "an unfolding algorithm is applied , taking into account shower fluctuations and experimental effects .",
    "the hadronic interactions have been simulated using the model qgsjet above 80  gev and the gheisha code below .",
    "individual energy spectra for the four mass groups are obtained as shown in figure [ 4groups ] .",
    "each spectrum shows a _",
    "knee_like structure .",
    "the energy dependence of these cut  offs suggests a rigidity  dependent behaviour .",
    "the mean logarithmic mass calculated from the individual energy spectra is shown in figure [ ulrichlna ] , indicating an increase of the average mass above the _",
    "the eas observables obtained by kascade are sensitive to hadronic interaction models used in simulations to interpret eas data . at present , the combination corsika / qgsjet best describes the measurements .",
    "the systematic dependence of the mean logarithmic mass on different observables and models has been investigated .",
    "the systematic error for the model qgsjet is in the order of @xmath22 .",
    "the reconstruction of individual energy spectra for groups of elements indicate a rigidity dependent cut  off , which explains the _ knee _ in the all particle cosmic  ray flux spectrum .",
    "the kascade experiment is supported by the ministry for research of the german government and embedded in collaborative wtz projects between germany and romania ( rum 97/014 ) , poland ( pol 99/005 ) , and armenia ( arm 98/002 ) .",
