    "one of the problems in cosmology is to understand the formation of the large - scale structures in the universe , as traced by the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "theoretical models of large - scale structure and galaxy formation , whether involving analytical predictions or numerical simulations , are based on some form of random or stochastic initial conditions .",
    "this means that a statistical interpretation of the observed galaxy distribution is required , and that statistical tools must be deployed in order to discriminate between different cosmological models ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most frequently employed statistical measure is the two - point correlation function .",
    "higher - order correlations are important , but already the observed two - point correlation properties of the galaxy distribution impose strong constraints on the models of structure formation . however , two basically different interpretations of the observed two - point properties are discussed : in the `` standard '' picture the galaxy distribution is assumed to be homogeneous on large scales .",
    "the correlations of the deviations from this homogeneous distribution are quantified by the two - point correlation function @xmath0 ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in the alternative picture",
    "the galaxy distribution is modelled as a fractal .",
    "the two - point correlations are then measured with the conditional density @xmath1 ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous nature of a fractal challenges the standard picture . clearly , these two models lead to different interpretations of observational results . in this letter",
    "i will focus on the growing of the amplitude of the two - point correlation function @xmath0 with the sample depth .",
    "this growing amplitude is either explained with the scaling properties of a fractal or with luminosity segregation , a luminosity dependent clustering strength . by reanalysing three galaxy catalogues",
    "i will show that there are strong arguments in favour of luminosity segregation .",
    "let me first discuss the stochastic picture where the galaxies positions in space are treated as a realization of a random process .",
    "the product density @xmath2 is the probability of finding two galaxies in the volume elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . in a homogeneous and isotropic point distribution with mean",
    "number density @xmath5 one defines the two - point correlation function @xmath0 ( e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the conditional density can be defined as @xmath8 . for a point distribution on a fractal the mean number density @xmath5 , and also @xmath0 are not well defined .",
    "thus , in this case , one investigates the two - point correlations with the conditional density @xmath1 : the density of galaxies at a distance of @xmath9 as seen from another galaxy @xcite .",
    "a scale invariant cumulant @xmath0 is typically found in critical systems , whereas a scale invariant conditional density @xmath1 is an indication for a fractal system .",
    "clearly , only in the limit @xmath10 , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 may show the same scaling behaviour .",
    "an instructive discussion of the different scaling regimes in the galaxy distribution is presented by @xcite .",
    "in a typical galaxy catalogue the position on the sky inside a given angular region @xmath11 and the flux in a given wave - band are measured . the distance to our position",
    "is estimated from the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "a flux - limited sample consists out of galaxies down to a limiting flux @xmath12 . to study the clustering properties of such a galaxy catalogue ,",
    "i extract a sequence of volume - limited samples .",
    "a volume - limited subsample is constructed by introducing a limiting depth @xmath13 and a limiting luminosity @xmath14 and by admitting only galaxies within a distance @xmath15 from our position and a luminosity @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , in the euclidean case , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ssrs2-ls ] ) .    for a given sample",
    "one defines the sample - dependent number density @xmath18 , with the number of galaxies @xmath19 , and the volume @xmath20 . the two - point correlation function @xmath21 , and the conditional density @xmath22 determined from this sample satisfy the relation @xmath23 .",
    "if our galaxy sample stems from a homogeneous distribution , neither @xmath21 nor @xmath22 should change if one increases the sample size ( despite statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "if our sample stems from a point distribution on a fractal the number density @xmath24 is depending on the sample size , but the scaling exponent @xmath25 of @xmath26 stays invariant ( @xmath27 is the correlation dimension ) . as a result @xmath21 is changing with the size of the sample ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for the two - point correlation function often the following parameterisation is used @xmath28 with the scaling index @xmath29 .",
    "the so - called `` correlation length '' @xmath30 quantifies the amplitude @xmath31 of a scale invariant correlation function .",
    "consider a large sample with a depth @xmath32 and several smaller samples @xmath33 within ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) . on a fractal @xmath30 is proportional to @xmath13 @xcite , specifically @xmath34 in the following i will estimate the two - point correlation function as well as the conditional density for three galaxy samples .",
    "i checked that for the samples and the scales considered here , the estimators discussed by @xcite give consistent results .",
    "i illustrate this by showing the results for @xmath0 both for the minus ( reduced sample ) estimator as favoured by @xcite , and the estimator due to landy & szalay @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the landy & szalay estimator has preferable variance properties .",
    "the southern sky redshift survey  2 ( ssrs2 , @xcite ) is 99% complete with a limiting magnitude of @xmath35 ( magnitudes are logarithmic flux measures ) .",
    "the angular extent is @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 ( declination @xmath40 , galactic latitude @xmath41 ) .",
    "the magnitudes were @xmath42-corrected as described in @xcite , and luminosity distances were used .",
    "nearly identical results could be obtained using euclidean distances and no @xmath42-correction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssrs2-vollim ] both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are shown for a sequence of volume - limited samples from the ssrs2 .",
    "the number density in the volume - limited samples decreases from 70  to 120 .",
    "consequently , the conditional density @xmath1 is decreasing with the sample depth .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath0 increases with the depth of the samples , and @xmath30 roughly follows the relation  .",
    "this was interpreted as a sign of a fractal galaxy distribution ( e.g.@xcite ) . however , another explanation is possible . due to the construction of the volume - limited sample the mean absolute luminosity of the galaxies in the sample increases with the depth of the sample ( compare with fig .  [",
    "fig : ssrs2-ls ] ) .",
    "hence , the growing amplitude of the correlation function for deeper volume - limited samples may be a result of the stronger clustering of the more luminous galaxies .",
    "this is called luminosity segregation . clearly , the two - point correlation function @xmath0 applied to a sequence of volume - limited samples is not able to distinguish between both claims . to test the scaling relation   independent from any luminosity dependence",
    "i use a volume - limited sample with a depth of @xmath43 . from this volume - limited sample",
    "i extract a sequence of subsamples with depths of @xmath33 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sample ] ) .",
    "all these subsamples have the same lower limit in luminosity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ssrs2-ls ] ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ssrs2-seq ] the estimated @xmath0 are consistent in these samples but inconsistent with the fractal prediction .",
    "there is no indication for a fractal scaling of the `` correlation length '' @xmath44 as given in eq .. moreover , the conditional densities @xmath1 of these samples nearly overlap .",
    "measurement errors , e.g.  for the position of the galaxies , have no visible effect on the correlation functions .",
    "the dominant contribution is the statistical error .",
    "however there is only one realisation of the galaxy distribution in the universe .",
    "therefore , i have to assume a model to quantify the statistical errors .",
    "the simplest model is a purely random distribution of points , the poisson process .",
    "i estimate the errors from 100 realisations of a poisson process with the sample geometry , and the number density as in the galaxy samples .",
    "later on i will show that a more realistic modelling leads to larger errors .",
    "these errors are within the same order as determined from a poisson process . for both models ,",
    "the errors are smaller than the predicted effects from fractal scaling .",
    "as a spatially complementary sample to the ssrs2 i use a galaxy sample from the cfa galaxy catalogue ( see @xcite and references therein ) , with @xmath45 , and @xmath46 and a limiting magnitude of @xmath35 . from this galaxy catalogue",
    "i extract similar volume - limited samples as for the ssrs2 .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ fig : cfa2-vollim],[fig : cfa2-seq ] lead to the same interpretation as for the ssrs2 : the growing amplitude of @xmath0 is caused by luminosity segregation .",
    "both the galaxies in the ssrs2 and the cfa2 were selected in the optical waveband . the galaxies in the pscz survey",
    "were selected according to their flux in the infrared as detected by the iras satellite . a detailed description of the iras pscz galaxy catalogue may be found in @xcite .",
    "i extract volume - limited samples from the pscz survey using luminosity distances within the standard masked area .",
    "i approximate the sample geometry by two spherical caps with galactic latitude @xmath47 for the northern part and with @xmath48 for the southern part .",
    "hence , i neglect some regions which were left empty due to galactic absorption or confusion in the iras psc maps .",
    "i filled these empty regions with random points assuming the same number density as in the fully sampled region .",
    "no differences in the correlation properties between the filled and unfilled samples are visible in the two - point measures .",
    "the @xmath0 determined from a sequence of volume - limited samples is inconsistent with the fractal prediction and shows no significant variation of @xmath30 with the sample size ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pscz - vollim ] ) . as expected ,",
    "extracting subsamples from one volume - limited sample with @xmath43 does not change this behaviour , although the fluctuations increase in the sparser samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pscz - seq ] ) . clearly , there is neither an indication for a fractal scaling of @xmath30 with the sample depth nor for luminosity segregation ( see also @xcite ) . due to the selection of galaxies in the infrared one",
    "does miss early type ( e.g.  elliptical ) galaxies . because of this selection one does not find luminosity segregation in the pscz @xcite .    to go beyond",
    "the error estimates relying on the poisson process i estimate the errors for @xmath0 from the fluctuations between eleven mock galaxy catalogues , constructed from an @xmath19-body simulation based on a @xmath49cdm cosmology .",
    "for such a clustered point distribution , the error bars are larger than in the case of the poisson process , but still of the same order ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : pscz - vollim],[fig : pscz - seq ] ) . in both models , these errors are smaller than the predicted effects of fractal scaling on @xmath0 ( two-@xmath50 error bars are shown in the plots ) .",
    "by analysing three different galaxy catalogues i could show that the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath0 is depending on the luminosity .",
    "luminosity segregation already has been found in the ssrs2 , cfa2 and also the 2df and the sdss galaxy catalogues ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in these investigations mainly volume - limited samples with varying depths or directly flux - limited samples have been used . using such samples",
    "one is not able to separate the influence of luminosity segregation from a possible fractal scaling . in samples with a fixed lower limit in the luminosity and",
    "then reducing the depth of the samples i found no significant changes in the correlation function .",
    "specifically , i found no sign for a growth of the correlation length @xmath30 with increasing sample depths in these cases . this is a strong indication that the growth of @xmath30 in standard volume - limited samples is caused by luminosity segregation , and a fractal explanation is disfavoured . using a similar construction @xcite found a growing @xmath30 in the perseus pisces survey ( pps ) .",
    "our consistent results , both from the significantly larger ssrs2 and the cfa2 indicate that the pps is too small in size to give reliable results . in the cfa2 @xcite",
    "found also no significant growth of @xmath30 using a comparable method .",
    "@xcite used mark correlation functions to quantify the luminosity dependency of the galaxy clustering in the ssrs2 in a scale dependent way , uninfluenced by inhomogeneities .",
    "i limited my investigations to the question : what causes the growing amplitude of the two - point correlation function ? already with the current galaxy catalogues",
    "one is able to show that the amplitude of the two - point correlation function is depending on the luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "if one a priori assumes that the galaxy distribution is a fractal , these results may be interpreted as large fluctuations , which indeed are common in fractals .",
    "however , these fluctuations must conspire in all the samples considered here , to give the observed result of a constant amplitude of the two - point correlation function .",
    "fluctuations in the morphological properties of the large scale distribution of galaxies have been detected out to a scale of 200   @xcite .",
    "however , these fluctuations are barely visible with two - point measures , and they are still compatible with fluctuations expected from a @xmath49cdm model .",
    "i did not comment on the topic , whether one already does see a turnover to homogeneity from current galaxy surveys @xcite , and whether @xmath0 or @xmath1 shows the more extended scaling regime . for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "i expect that the completed sloan digital sky survey will offer conclusive evidence for these points .",
    "i would like to thank ruth durrer and francesco sylos labini for organising the workshop `` facts and fiction in cosmology '' in april 2001 in sils maria .",
    "the discussions during this workshop generated the impulse to re - investigate these galaxy catalogues .",
