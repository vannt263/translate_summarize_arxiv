    "if there exists a tree @xmath1 , an edge - weight function @xmath13 that assigns positive values to the edges of @xmath1 and two non - negative real numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath14 , such that each vertex @xmath5 is uniquely associated to a leaf @xmath4 of @xmath1 and there is an edge @xmath6 if and only if @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sum of the weights of the edges on the unique path from @xmath4 to @xmath9 in @xmath1 .",
    "in such a case , we say that @xmath0 is a pcg of @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; in symbols , @xmath15 .",
    "it is clear that if a tree @xmath1 , an edge - weight function @xmath13 and two values @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given , the construction of a pcg is a trivial problem .",
    "we focus on the reverse of this problem , i.e. , given a graph @xmath0 we have to find out a tree @xmath1 , an edge - weight function @xmath13 and suitable values , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that @xmath16 .",
    "such a problem is called the _ pairwise compatibility tree construction problem_.    the concept of pairwise compatibility was introduced in @xcite in a computational biology context and the weight function @xmath13 has positive values , as it represents a not null distance .",
    "there are several known specific graph classes of pairwise compatibility graphs , e.g. , cliques and disjoint union of cliques @xcite , chordless cycles and single chord cycles @xcite , some particular subclasses of bipartite graphs @xcite , some particular subclasses of split matrogenic graphs @xcite .",
    "furthermore a lot of work has been done concerning some particular subclasses of pcg as leaf power graphs @xcite , exact leaf power graphs @xcite and lately a new subclass has been introduced , namly the min - leaf power graphs @xcite .",
    "initially , the authors of @xcite conjectured that every graph is a pcg , but this conjecture has been confuted in @xcite , where a particular bipartite graph with 15 nodes has been proved not to be a pcg .",
    "this latter result has given rise to this research as it is natural to ask for the smallest graph that is not a pcg .",
    "a _ caterpillar _ @xmath17 is an @xmath18-leaf tree for which any leaf is at a distance exactly one from a central path called _",
    "spine_. a _ centipede _ is an @xmath18-leaf caterpillar , in which the edges incident to the leaves produce a perfect matching . deleting from an @xmath18-leaf centipede",
    "the degree two vertices and merging the two edges incident to each of these vertices into a unique edge , results in a new caterpillar that we will call _ reduced centipede _ and denote by @xmath19 ( as an example , @xmath20 is depicted at the top left of fig .",
    "[ fig.5nodes ] ) .",
    "caterpillars are interesting trees in the context of pcgs , as in most of the cases , the pairwise compatibility tree construction problem admits as solution a tree that is in fact a caterpillar . for this reason , we focus on this special kind of tree . in this note",
    ", we prove that all the graphs with at most seven vertices are pcgs .",
    "more precisely , we demonstrate the following results :    * if @xmath21 , then there always exist a new edge - weight function @xmath22 , and a new value @xmath23 such that it also holds : @xmath24 . *",
    "it is well known that graphs with five vertices or less are all pcgs and the witness trees  not all caterpillars  are shown in @xcite .",
    "for each one of these graphs we prove that it is pcg of a reduced centipede , providing accordingly , an edge - weight function @xmath13 and the two values @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "* all the graphs with six and seven vertices , except for the wheel @xmath11 ( i.e. the graph formed by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a cycle of length six  see figure [ fig.wheel].a ) , are pcgs of a reduced centipede and , for each of them , we provide the edge - weight function @xmath13 and the two values @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that it is @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "* for what concerns the wheel @xmath11 , it is known @xcite that @xmath11 is not pcg of the reduced centipede @xmath27 ( and hence it is not pcg of a caterpillar ) . we show that @xmath11 is pcg of a tree different from a caterpillar .",
    "in this section we list some results that will turn out to be useful in the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath1 be a tree such that there exist an edge - weight function @xmath13 and two non - negative values @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that @xmath16 . observe that if @xmath1 has at least @xmath28 vertices and contains a vertex @xmath29 of degree @xmath30 , then we can construct a new tree @xmath31 in which @xmath29 is eliminated , the two edges @xmath32 and @xmath33 incident to @xmath29 are merged into a unique edge @xmath34 and a new function @xmath22 is defined from @xmath13 only modifying the weight of the new edge , that is set equal to the sum of the weights of the old edges : @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath36 .",
    "for this reason , from now on , we will assume that all the trees we handle do not contain vertices of degree two .",
    "@xcite [ prop.integer ] let @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and the weight @xmath39 of each edge @xmath40 of @xmath1 are positive real numbers .",
    "then it is possible to choose @xmath41 such that for any @xmath40 , the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 are natural numbers and @xmath44 .",
    "we prove here the following useful lemma :    [ lemma.1 ] let @xmath37 .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath41 such that @xmath45 , where the minimum is computed on all the edges of @xmath1 , and @xmath44 .    according to proposition [ prop.integer ]",
    ", we can assume that the edge weight @xmath13 and the two values @xmath46 are integers .",
    "let @xmath47 be the edges of @xmath1 incident to the leaves .",
    "without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath48 .",
    "we define @xmath49 as follows : @xmath50 and for each @xmath51 define @xmath52 .",
    "clearly , the function @xmath49 is well defined as all its values are positive .    as the weight of any edge incident to a leaf",
    "has been decreased by exactly @xmath53 and the rest of the weights remained unchanged , then for of any two leaves @xmath54 it holds that @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath44 indeed , if @xmath58 then it means that there was no path weight below @xmath2 , with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the previous results imply that it is not restrictive to assume that the weights and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are integers and that the smallest weight is @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in the rest of the paper we will use these assumptions .",
    "in this section we will prove that we can get rid of different kinds of caterpillar structures and restrict to consider only reduced centipedes .",
    "[ th.caterpillar ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath18 vertex graph , @xmath17 and @xmath19 be an @xmath18-leaf caterpillar without degree 2 vertices and an @xmath18-leaf reduced centipede , respectively .",
    "let @xmath21 .",
    "it is possible to choose @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 .    in order not to overburden the exposition ,",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 is a reduced centipede , the claim is trivially proved , so assume it is not .",
    "we lead the proof into two steps .",
    "first we define a non - negative edge - weight function @xmath63 proving that @xmath62 weighted by @xmath13 and @xmath64 weighted by @xmath63 generate the same pcg @xmath0 for the same values @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". then we modify @xmath63 into a positive weight function @xmath22 and introduce two new values @xmath65 and @xmath23 proving that @xmath0 is also @xmath66 .",
    "draw @xmath62 so that : i ) the spine lies on a horizontal line , ii ) all the leaves lie on a parallel line and iii ) the edges between the spine and the leaves are represented as non - crossing line segments ; number the leaves and the vertices of the spine from left to right @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , respectively . by drawing the reduced centipede @xmath64 in a similar way , we number the leaves and the vertices of the spine from left to right by @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    we define the edge - weight function @xmath63 as follows :    * let @xmath72 the unique adjacent vertex of @xmath73 in @xmath62 ; for each @xmath74 , define @xmath75 ; * define @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; * for each @xmath78 , define @xmath79 if and only if @xmath80 in @xmath62 ; * for each @xmath78 , define @xmath81 if and only if @xmath82 in @xmath62 .    observe that @xmath63 is well defined , as @xmath62 has no degree 2 vertices .",
    "it is quite easy to convince oneself that for each pair of leaves in @xmath62 , @xmath73 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 is exactly the same as @xmath85 and that @xmath2 and @xmath3 remain unchanged , so @xmath86 .",
    "it remains to show that we can reassign the edge - weights of @xmath64 in a way that any edge gets a positive weight and @xmath64 is the pairwise compatibility tree of @xmath0 . to this purpose",
    ", we denote by @xmath87 the edge set of any graph @xmath88 , and we introduce the following two quantities : @xmath89    @xmath90 is the smallest distance between the quantities @xmath46 and the weighted distances on the tree of the paths corresponding to non - edges of @xmath0 ; @xmath91 is the number of edges of @xmath64 of weight @xmath92 .",
    "observe that , unless @xmath0 coincides with the clique @xmath93 ( which trivially is pcg of the reduced centipede ) , there always exists a pair of leaves such that their distance on @xmath64 falls out of the interval @xmath94 $ ] and hence @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , as any edge incident to a leaf in @xmath64 is strictly greater than @xmath92 and in view of the hypothesis that the caterpillar @xmath62 is not a reduced caterpillar , it holds @xmath96 ( the bound @xmath97 is reached when @xmath62 is a star ) .",
    "so , the value @xmath98 is well defined .    now define a new weight function @xmath22 on @xmath64 by assigning the weight @xmath99 to any edge of weight @xmath92 . more formally , @xmath100 if @xmath101 and @xmath102 otherwise . in this way the distance between any two leaves in @xmath64 can result increased by a value upper bounded by @xmath103 .",
    "set the new value @xmath104 .",
    "the following three observations conclude the proof :    * any distance between leaves in @xmath64 that was strictly smaller than @xmath2 with respect to the weight function @xmath63 remains so after this transformation in view of the fact that @xmath103 ; * any distance that was strictly greater than @xmath3 with respect to the weight function @xmath63 is strictly greater than @xmath23 due to the definition of @xmath90 ; * any distance that was in the interval @xmath94 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath63 is now in the interval @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "observe that the previous statement suggests not to consider all kinds of caterpillars , but to restrict to reduced centipedes , only .",
    "in the next section we exploit this result .",
    "in this section we show that all graphs with at most seven vertices , except for the wheel @xmath11 , are pcgs of a reduced centipede .",
    "analogously to what we did in the proof of theorem [ th.caterpillar ] , name the leaves of @xmath19 from left to right with @xmath67 and the vertices of the spine from left to right with @xmath106 .",
    "as , for any @xmath18 , there exists a unique unlabeled reduced centipede with @xmath18 leaves @xmath19 , in the following we consider the edges of @xmath19 as ordered in the following way : @xmath107 ; @xmath108 for each @xmath109 ; @xmath110 ; finally , @xmath111 for each @xmath112 .      in figure [ fig.5nodes ]",
    "all the 18 connected non isomorphic cyclic graphs with 5 vertices are depicted , together with the vector @xmath114 and the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 that witness that all of them are pcgs of @xmath20 .",
    "observe that the connected non isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices are 21 , we have omitted the 3 graphs that are trees , which are trivially pcgs .",
    "we remind that it is already proved in @xcite that all the graphs with at most five vertices are pcg , but the provided trees were all different and not all caterpillars .    for what concerns graphs with 6 and 7 vertices , except for the wheel @xmath11 , we get a similar result . for the sake of brevity we do not depict all these graphs ( there are 112 connected non isomorphic graphs with 6 vertices and 853 with 7 vertices ) , but the values of @xmath114 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 we got with the help of an enumerative c program can be found at the web page https://sites.google.com/site/pcg6and7vertices/ .",
