    ", the quantization of the free mcs theory in the coulomb gauge already demands special care , due to the appearance of infrared divergences@xcite .",
    "although it has been argued@xcite that these singularities can be avoided and some results of the coulomb gauge version of the theory have been used from time to time for different purposes@xcite , the consistency of this formulation has not yet been fully established .",
    "this paper is dedicated to study the coulomb gauge quantization of the mcs model .    in section",
    "ii we determine the polarization vector for the free mcs theory in the coulomb gauge .",
    "this is an essential piece of information in what follows and , as will be seen , it will be done by gauge transforming the polarization vector of the landau gauge .    in section iii the free mcs theory",
    "is canonically quantized , in the coulomb gauge , by using the dirac bracket quantization procedure@xcite . after finding the equal - time commutation relations and the canonical hamiltonian",
    ", we build the reduced phase space@xcite and , then , solve the heisenberg equations of motion for the independent variables .",
    "afterwards , the hilbert space of physical states is constructed .",
    "as we shall see , all excitations turn out to be massive .",
    "section iv is dedicated to study the poincar symmetry for the free mcs model .",
    "we first show that there exist a set of densities with vanishing vacuum expectation values and obeying the dirac - schwinger equal - time commutator algebra@xcite .",
    "these densities are , therefore , free of anomalies and their space integrals yield the corresponding poincar generators .",
    "of particular interest is the generator of rotations because of the delicate mechanism giving rise to the spin of the gauge particle .",
    "the fermions are brought into the game in section v. the dirac bracket quantization procedure is used again to quantize the full theory in the coulomb gauge . then , the free hamiltonian , the interaction hamiltonian and the feynman rules are found .",
    "the core of the section is concerned with the computation of the lowest order contribution to the mller scattering amplitude by using the coulomb gauge feynman rules .",
    "we demonstrate that the result agrees with that found by using covariant gauge feynman rules@xcite and , moreover , that the infrared safe propagator@xcite arises as an effective photon propagator which allows for replacing all non - covariant terms in the interaction hamiltonian by the field - current minimal interaction    in section vi we analyze the mller scattering amplitude to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we prove , order by order , that the coulomb and the covariant gauge feynman rules yield the same result .",
    "the conclusions are contained in section vii .",
    "the dynamics of the free mcs theory is described by the lagrangian density    @xmath15    from which one derives the following equation of motion for the field @xmath16 ,    @xmath17    after taking into account the coulomb gauge condition ,    @xmath18    the equation of motion ( [ 22 ] ) reduces to    @xmath19    in hamiltonian language , the mcs theory possesses two first - class constraints and , hence , two subsidiary conditions are needed to fix the gauge completely@xcite .",
    "thus , one is left with only two independent variables in phase space , one coordinate and one momentum .",
    "correspondingly , this theory only exhibits one degree of freedom in configuration space@xcite .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to write a plane wave solution of ( [ 24 ] ) in terms of a single polarization vector ( @xmath20 ) , namely ,    @xmath21    when ( [ 25 ] ) is inserted back into ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) one obtains , respectively , @xmath22    and    @xmath23    where    @xmath24    the vanishing of the determinant of the matrix @xmath25 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the homogeneous system of equations in ( [ 27 ] ) to have solutions different from the trivial one @xmath26 .",
    "one easily finds that    @xmath27    hence , there are , in principle , three independent solutions for the system ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "this seems to contradict the above conclusion based on the counting of the number of independent degrees of freedom .",
    "however , one is to notice that the polarization vector associated with the massless mode @xmath28 can only occur if @xmath29 which in turn implies that @xmath16 is just a constant . to the same conclusion one arrives by specializing ( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 271 ] ) to the case @xmath30 .",
    "thus , as previously asserted , only one of the excitations is dynamical .",
    "this is the one associated with the massive mode @xmath31 .",
    "we next focus on finding the polarization vector for the massive excitation @xmath31 .",
    "the transversality condition ( [ 26 ] ) is readily satisfied by choosing    @xmath32    with the aim of determining the unknown function @xmath33 , we replace ( [ 28 ] ) into ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath34 we obtain    @xmath35    while for @xmath36 one arrives at    @xmath37    which sais that the function @xmath33 remains unknown .",
    "one may argue that a normalization condition for the space - like vector @xmath38 , that is still lacking , is all what is needed to solve for @xmath39 .",
    "however , through this kind of device one only determines the modulus of @xmath39 , while a possible phase factor would be missed .",
    "as will be seen , it is precisely a @xmath40-dependent phase factor which accounts for the existence of spin in the present case .",
    "furthermore , a simple calculation shows that , for example , @xmath41 leads to a function @xmath42 which does not fulfills the regularity requirements assumed for a polarization vector .",
    "this difficulties recognize as common origin the fact that one is dealing with massive gauge quanta .",
    "indeed , @xmath43 implies in the existence of a rest frame of reference ( @xmath44 ) for these particles and , in such frame , the coulomb condition ( [ 26 ] ) becomes ambiguous .",
    "this is an entirely new situation as compared with that encountered , for instance , in the coulomb gauge formulation of qed@xmath45 , where the gauge particle is massless .",
    "we are , then , forced to adopt a new strategy for finding for @xmath46 .",
    "it consists in reaching the coulomb gauge from the landau gauge ( @xmath47 ) through the gauge transformation linking these two gauges identify quantities belonging to the landau gauge .",
    "coulomb gauge quantities remain without gauge identification . ] .",
    "one is to observe that , unlike the case of the coulomb gauge , the landau gauge condition    @xmath48    remains operative even in the rest frame of reference ( @xmath44 ) . in landau gauge , ( [ 271 ] ) is replaced by    @xmath49    whose determinant is    @xmath50    as seen , there are massless and massive excitations in the landau gauge@xcite .    for @xmath28 ,",
    "the simultaneous solving of ( [ 202 ] ) and    @xmath51    is straightforward and yields    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is an arbitrary function of @xmath40 .",
    "this confirms that the massless excitations are pure gauge artefacts@xcite .    on the other hand , for @xmath31",
    "one finds that    [ 204 ] @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the polarization in the rest frame of reference and @xmath56 . from eq.([204 ] ) follows that@xcite    [ 205 ] @xmath57    to summarize , the physically meaningful landau gauge polarization vector @xmath58 turns out to be a complex space - like vector obeying    [ 206 ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 is to be fixed by normalization .",

    "when this result is replaced back into ( [ 207 ] ) one gets @xmath67 indicating that the massless ( pure gauge ) excitations are not present in the coulomb gauge . as in 3 + 1-dimensions ,",

    "the basic observation is that the difference between the landau and the infrared safe propagator , given at eqs.([507 ] ) and ( [ 505 ] ) , respectively , is of the form    @xmath171    where    @xmath172    consequently , the purported proof of equivalence has now been reduced to show that if in all graphs , of a given order in perturbation theory , one of the photon propagators is replaced by the right hand side of ( [ 61 ] ) , the sum of these modified graphs vanish .    to see how this come about we examine the generic diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , where an internal photon line has been singled out . after performing the above mentioned replacement the graph decomposes into the sum of two pieces , each containing either @xmath173 or @xmath174 .",
    "we study first the part containing @xmath173 , hereafter referred to as @xmath175 .",
    "we furthermore assume that the incoming and outgoing fermion lines meeting at the vertex @xmath176 carry momentum @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively . by using    @xmath179\\ , - \\,(\\gamma \\cdot p - m)\\,,\\ ] ]    one",
    "gets    @xmath180    thus , the fermion lines meeting at the vertex under analysis become amputated , one at the time .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath175 splits into the sum of two contracted subgraphs .    if the amputated line was an external fermion line , the corresponding contracted subgraph vanishes due to the on shell condition .    if the amputated line was an internal fermion line we must still distinguish two possibilities .",
    "first , the amputated line did not link directly the vertices @xmath176 and @xmath181 . when this is the case , the contribution to the amplitude arising from this contracted subgraph is cancelled by the contribution made by a topollogically equivalent contracted subgraph , originating from another diagram .",
    "secondly , the amputated line did link the vertices @xmath176 and @xmath181 .",
    "then , it is clear that the contracted subgraph contains the tadpole integral    @xmath182    which can be seen to vanish due to symmetry requirements . through similar arguments",
    "one shows that @xmath183 also vanishes .",
    "the proof of gauge independence for the mller scattering amplitude in the mcs theory is now complete .",
    "it greatly helps to establish the reliability of the quantization of the mcs model in the coulomb gauge .",
    "we started in this work by looking for the coulomb gauge polarization vector of the free mcs theory .",
    "we found impossible to determine such vector by working only within the coulomb gauge .",
    "the reason for this being clear , the mcs theory is a gauge theory whose gauge particle is massive when formulated in the coulomb gauge .",
    "hence , one can think of a frame of reference where this quanta is at rest .",
    "in such frame ( @xmath44 ) the coulomb condition @xmath184 is not longer operative .",
    "the way out from the trouble consisted in finding first the polarization vectors of the landau gauge , where there exist massive and massless gauge particles .",
    "the massless excitation is a gauge artefact that dissapears when gauge transformed into the coulomb gauge .",
    "the polarization vector associated with the massive excitation provides , after being gauge transformed , the coulomb gauge polarization vector , which turned out to be free of ambiguities . in 2 + 1-dimensions",
    "the coulomb gauge appears to be as respectable as it is in 3 + 1-dimensions , in the sense that it only allows for physical excitations .",
    "we constructed , afterwards , a set of quantum densities obeying the dirac - schwinger algebra .",
    "these densities were taken as the poincar densities and served to build the poincar generators .",
    "particular attention was dedicated to the generator of spatial rotations .",
    "it was shown that the spin of the massive gauge particles originates from the highly unconventional mathematical structure of the coulomb gauge polarization vector .",
    "the mcs gauge particles were then allow to interact with charged fermions .",
    "a practical test of the coulomb gauge feynman rules for the interacting theory was carried out in connection with the mller scattering amplitude . as demanded by gauge invariance ,",
    "the result was shown to agree , to all orders in perturbation theory , with that obtained by using covariant feynman rules .",
    "this proof was based on the observation that the coulomb gauge feynman rules can be phrased in terms of an effective photon propagator , the infrared safe propagator@xcite , which allows for the replacement of all terms in the interaction hamiltonian ( see eq.([56 ] ) ) by the standard field - current minimal interaction .",
