    "<S> d * ( december 2006 , special issue )    cern - ph - th/2006 - 031 + february 2006    0.2 cm    the presence of a new ultraviolet scale @xmath2 for effective theories with gravity and @xmath1 gauge fields , with coupling @xmath3 , has recently been conjectured in the first hep - th paper of the year @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical evidence for this conjecture has been presented , mainly based on the properties of known ( heterotic ) string theory backgrounds , and it has been argued that this conjecture could be related to a new criterion for distinguishing parts of the  swampland \" @xcite from the string  landscape \" .    according to @xcite , the conjectured scale @xmath2 is hidden , and completely unexpected , in the context of the effective field theory ; here we will suggest that , rather surprisingly , there could be a hint at such a scale in present astrophysical observations . we are referring , in particular , to the  electro - gravity \" scale @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical relevance of such a scale might emerge from observed regularities concerning the mass , the angular momentum , and the magnetic moment of various classes of astrophysical structures . </S>",
    "<S> such regularities were noticed long ago but , up to now , have not been unambiguously explained in the context of standard ( effective ) models of gravity and electromagnetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss the possibility that they be related to the general weakness of gravity with respect to gauge forces , according to the conjecture presented in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by recalling an empirical relation which seems to connect the mass @xmath5 and the angular momentum @xmath6 of many classes of astronomical objects , ranging from planets to superclusters . </S>",
    "<S> the relation was originally proposed in the form @xcite @xmath7 , and later extended to a generic slope @xmath8 as follows @xcite : j= p m^ , [ 1 ] where @xmath9 is some  universal \" phenomenological parameter to be determined by observations . </S>",
    "<S> detailed compilations of data have shown the presence of a considerable scattering of points in the @xmath10 plane within the various astrophysical classes , but the overall fit of the plots of @xmath11 versus @xmath12 , for all classes of objects , has confirmed that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) may be representative of the general trend of the data . in that case , the slope @xmath8 has been determined to be @xmath13 according to a first compilation @xcite , and @xmath14 in a subsequent , larger compilation of data running over about @xmath15 powers of ten in the mass @xcite ( see fig . 1 , left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> both results are compatible with a power @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value of the ( dimensional ) coefficient @xmath9 is strongly correlated to the slope @xmath8 , and is thus affected by a large uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> if we fix @xmath16 , however , the corresponding mean value of @xmath9 is very similar in the two cases , as one obtains ( in cgs units ) @xmath17 according to @xcite , and @xmath18 from the data of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be remarked , at this point , that the case with slope @xmath16 is qualitatively different from the generic case @xmath19 , because for @xmath16 the dimensions of @xmath9 are such that we can express @xmath9 in terms of only two ( dimensional ) fundamental parameters , the newton constant @xmath20 and the ligth velocity @xmath21 ( indeed , @xmath22=[g_n c^{-1}]$ ] ) . if , instead , @xmath19 , then the definition of @xmath9 requires , besides @xmath20 and @xmath21 , another parameter with mass dimensions , since @xmath22=[g_nm^{2-\\da } c^{-1}]$ ] , and the possibility of a universal parametrization is lost . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus lead to the conjecture that the small deviations of @xmath8 from @xmath23 may represent  systematic \" perturbations ( due to local - physics effects ) of some underlying ,  scale - free \" fundamental relation , that can be empirically parametrized by setting @xmath16 and p^-1= g_n^-1c ,   = 2 , [ 2 ] where @xmath24 is a dimensionless number . with </S>",
    "<S> this assumption one obtains from the data a mean value of @xmath9 ranging from @xmath25 , according to @xmath26 , to @xmath27 , from the results of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a second empirical relation concerns the approximated proportionality between the angular momentum and the magnetic moment @xmath28 of astronomical bodies . by setting j= q m^[4 ] </S>",
    "<S> one then finds that for @xmath29 the numerical value of the ( dimensional ) parameter @xmath30 is of the same order of magnitude for many stars and planets . </S>",
    "<S> the recurrence of this direct proportionality coefficient ( sometimes referred as the  magnetic bode s law \" @xcite ) was pointed out long ago by blackett @xcite for the earth , the sun and the star @xmath31 virginis , and was later extended to other planets , white dwarfs , and pulsars in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after blackett , new and direct tests of this relation have been proposed also for macroscopic spinning bodies in the laboratory @xcite , and the required sensitivity for these experiments seems now to be within the reach of modern technology .    </S>",
    "<S> it is unclear , at present , whether such an empirical correlation may retain universal validity when extrapolated to include other ( and larger ) classes of astronomical objects ( the analyses are also complicated , in general , by the possible variability in time of the magnetic fields , by the presence of toroidal and polar magnetic components ,  ) . </S>",
    "<S> a recent data analysis @xcite , spanning a range of about @xmath32 orders of magnitude in both @xmath6 and @xmath28 , has indeed confirmed the trend suggested in @xcite for the planetary sector , and extended it to a large compilation of stellar objects , in the sense that the plots of @xmath33 versus @xmath11 , for the  centers of gravity \" of the data of the various sub - samples , have been fitted by an overall slope @xmath34 , which is marginally compatible with @xmath29 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been shown that there are significant deviations from this mean result inside the sub - samples of data corresponding to different astrophysical classes ( deviations from a linear @xmath35 correlation are most evident for hot stars , isolated white dwarfs , and isolated pulsars @xcite ) .     </S>",

    "<S> @xcite).__,title=\"fig:\",width=298 ]    the statistical significance of the proposed correlation fitting the complete set of data , averaged over all sub - samples , is likely to remain controversial for a long time , as also noted in @xcite . leaving this problem to a forthcoming , more detailed analysis @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we will take seriously the results of @xcite , and we shall concentrate the following discussion on the case @xmath29 which is ( at least marginally ) compatible with the data , and which is dimensionally preferred , as before , in the sense of allowing a scale - free parametrization of @xmath30 in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath20 only . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath37 the definition of @xmath30 requires indeed an extra length parameter , as @xmath38= [ c^{3 - 2\\ep } l^{2 - 2\\ep } g_n^{-1+\\ep/2}]$ ] ; with @xmath29 we can instead adopt a universal parametization , and set q^-2= g_n c^-2 ,   = 1 , [ 5 ] where @xmath39 is a dimensionless coefficient . using the data reported in @xcite , and the mean value of @xmath30 associated to the slope @xmath29 , one then finds @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is very close to the value of @xmath39 one would obtain from the old analyses of @xcite , mainly restricted to the planetary sector .    </S>",
    "<S> now we come to the new and central point of this paper , namely to the observation that the experimental values of the two dimensionless coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath39 turn out to be not only very close to each other , within observational uncertainties , but also very close to the numerical value of the fine - structure constant , @xmath41 . barring an accidental numerical coincidence , </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to our central assumption , namely to the speculation that the two coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath39 actually represent _ the same _ physical parameter ( modulo numerical factors of order @xmath42 ) , and that this parameter actually corresponds to the fine - structure constant : _ </S>",
    "<S> em = e^2/c 1/137 7.3 10 ^ -3 . </S>",
    "<S> [ 7 ]    this simple assumption , suggested by the astrophysical data , leads immediately to the disclosure of a direct connection between the new cut - off scales conjectured in @xcite and the two empirical laws ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 4 ] ) . according to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , in fact , the parameter @xmath9 determines an energy scale @xmath43 given ( in natural units @xmath44 ) by p^-1/2 ~= = e , [ 8 ] which is exactly the new uv scale suggested in @xcite . according to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) , the parameter @xmath30 determines instead the  dual \" magnetic scale q ~= = e= g_mag , [ 9 ] also suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it seems remarkable that these two related scales emerge _ separately _ and quite _ independently _ from two different ( and apparently unrelated ) empirical laws . </S>",
    "<S> one might see in this result a signal supporting the conjectures of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out , however , that the numerical value of @xmath45 is not very different from a realistic asymptotic value of the square of the gut gauge - coupling parameter , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a curious coincidence that the replacement of @xmath47 with @xmath48 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 ] ) would lead to extract from the data another energy scale , @xmath49 , which also may have the meaning of uv cut - off scale ( numerically similar but conceptually very different from @xmath50 ) , as recently stressed on the grounds of the principle of asymptotic saturation of all couplings , induced by loop corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the additional relation ( [ 9 ] ) , and the presence of macroscopic magnetic fields in the relevant macroscopic observations , however , would seem to point at the electro - gravity scales ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) as a possibly more appropriate interpretation of the data .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be mentioned that the near coincidence of @xmath24 and @xmath51 was previously noticed in @xcite , without any reference , however , to the empirical law concerning magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> also , a theoretical interpretation of the parameter @xmath30 , as a possible imprint of early geometric spin - torsion interactions at the epoch of structure formation , was attempted in @xcite , providing the result @xmath52 , in agreement with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 9 ] ) ( leaving unexplained , however , the mass - angular momentum relation ) . the interpretation of @xmath43 , @xmath53 as effective cut - off scales , following the conjectures of @xcite , seems instead to connect two different empirical relations , and to predict a limiting scale for the angular momentum and the magnetic moment of macroscopic bodies of mass @xmath5 , fixing a lower bound on the _ maximal _ allowed values of @xmath6 and @xmath28 : j ( me ) ^2 ,   m [ 10 ] ( in natural units , from the combination of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 8 ] ) and eqs . ( </S>",
    "<S> [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) , respectively ) .    </S>",
    "<S> as remarked in @xcite for other restrictions implied by the uv scale @xmath43 , this _ does not _ </S>",
    "<S> mean that it is impossible to have states with @xmath6 and @xmath28 smaller than the bound ( [ 10 ] ) , but it means that there must exist states satisfying the above inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> the lesson we could learn , eventually , from the data is that the astrophysical structures , in the absence of perturbations , try to accumulate along a  preferred \" configuration corresponding to the state with the highest values of @xmath6 and @xmath28 compatible with the saturation of the above bound , required for a universe safely placed inside the string landscape @xcite . </S>"
