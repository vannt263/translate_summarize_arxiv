    "@xmath70 , the equation of state has to be `` hardened '' to account for the dominance of the `` repulsive core '' in the potential of particle interaction . in such `` hardened '' state , repulsion between particles",

    "the model admits a generalization to a multi  component system , including thermic radiation . for this , the expression for the free energy must be replaced by the sum of the free energy expression for every component .",
