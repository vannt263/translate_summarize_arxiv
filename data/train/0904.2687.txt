    "the general purpose large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments atlas and cms at cern have central detectors with a pseudorapidity @xmath0 coverage 2.5 for tracking system and 5.0 for calorimetry .",

    "moreover , some parts of the cross sections measured by the central detectors may belong to the elastic scattering and ultraperipheral collisions . for deeper understanding of the physics from very forward region",
    "additional equipments are needed .",
    "atlas and cms collaborations have a program of forward physics with extra detectors located in a region nearly 100m-400 m from the interaction point @xcite .",
    "these forward detectors will be installed as close as a few mm to the beamline .",
    "the physics program of this new instrumentation covers soft and hard diffraction , high energy photon induced interactions , low - x dynamics with forward jet studies , large rapidity gaps between forward jets , and luminosity monitoring @xcite .",
    "one of the main goal of these forward detectors is to tag the protons with some energy fraction loss @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , atlas and cms in standard running conditions will have forward detectors positioned at 220 m and 420 m from interaction point with an acceptance of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "totem experiment at 147 m and 220 m from cms interaction point together with standard cms - totem at 420 m have an overall acceptance @xmath3 .",
    "when the forward detectors are installed closer to the interaction points , higher @xmath4 is obtained .",
    "one of the well known applications of the forward detectors is the high energy photon induced interaction with exclusive two lepton ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) final states .",
    "two quasi - real photons emitted by each proton interact each other to produce two leptons @xmath7 . deflected protons and their energy loss",
    "will be detected by the forward detectors mentioned above but leptons will go to central detector .",
    "charged leptons with rapidity @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be identified by the central detector .",
    "photons emitted with small angles by the protons show a spectrum of virtuality @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 .",
    "this is described by the equivalent photon approximation @xcite which differs from the point - like electron positron case by taking care of the electromagnetic form factors in the equivalent photon spectrum and effective @xmath12 luminosity    @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath14    here e is the energy of the proton beam which is related to the photon energy by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the mass of the proton .",

    "the cross section @xmath20 for the subprocess @xmath7 should be integrated over the photon spectrum    @xmath21    where the effective photon luminosity @xmath22 is given by    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    here w is the invariant mass of the two photon system @xmath25 and maximum virtuality is @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the lepton pair production by two photon fusion yields very clean final states and it is convenient to use it as a luminosity monitor for the lhc .",
    "as it was discussed in ref.@xcite the main possible contamination comes from the proton dissociation into x , y system , @xmath28 where x and y are baryon excitations such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 isobars . to reduce this contribution it was proposed to impose a cut on the transverse momentum of the photon pair @xmath31mev . in actual experiment",
    "this cut should be applied on the lepton pair .",
    "it is shown in some detail in ref.@xcite that the cut of 30 mev on the transverse momentum of the lepton pair is possible although a cut of at least 5 gev is needed for individual lepton detection . however , in theoretical calculations , if one uses equivalent photon approximation the subprocess @xmath7 is factorized . in this case",
    ", this cut can be applied through effective photon luminosity using the relation between @xmath10 and transverse momentum of the photon @xmath32    @xmath33",
    "this is why we have kept integration over @xmath10 in the luminosity expression above . in fig.[fig1 ] effective @xmath12 luminosity is shown with and without transverse momentum cut imposed on the photon pair .",

    "lower curve represents the case with a cut on the total momentum of the photon pair @xmath34mev .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    it is clear that the photon - induced two lepton final states with invariant di - photon mass @xmath35 tev seems highly attractive to probe new physics beyond the standard model(sm ) with available luminosity .",
    "in this work , we explore the phenomenology of extra dimensions in the framework of the arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali(add ) model of large extra dimensions and randall - sundrum ( rs ) model of warped extra dimensions via the photon induced process @xmath36 at the lhc .",
    "it is well known that there is a large difference in energy between the electroweak scale which is a few hundreds of gev and gravity scale that is the planck scale @xmath37gev in a four dimensional spacetime .",
    "this is called the hierarchy problem in particle physics . in string theory ,",
    "extra space dimensions higher than three has already been contained .",
    "following the string theory ideas , three space dimensional world is called a `` wall '' or 3-brane where all standard model particles are confined to this wall .",
    "the d - dimensional spacetime , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 extra space dimensions is called `` bulk '' where 3-brane is embedded in it . the way how to handle hierarchy problem",
    "depends on the models .",
    "according to the model proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali sm fields can not go out of the 3-brane while gravity propagates in the bulk @xcite . in d dimensions ,",
    "the solutions of the linearized equations of motion of the metric field are the kaluza - klein tower .",
    "after integrations over extra dimensions , resulting 4-dimensional fields are the kaluza - klein modes .",
    "kk zero mode field is massless corresponding to the graviton in 4-dimensions but kk excited modes are massive . in this model",
    "extra dimensions are compactified with a compactification radius @xmath40mm - fermi ( or @xmath41ev - mev ) which determines the kk mode spacing .",
    "this mode spacing is very small when compared to typical collider energies which allows the summation over large number of kk states in the final states or in the propagator . because of this large compactification radius , add model is known as the large extra dimension model .",
    "the overall effect of the kk states makes the gravity strong in @xmath42 dimensions and thus its effective interactions in 4-dimensions with the standard model particles are sizable at collider energies .",
    "it is possible to relate the planck mass @xmath43 to the corresponding scale @xmath44 in d - dimensions through the compactified volume @xmath45 by the relation    @xmath46    it is assumed that @xmath44 is in tev region and @xmath43 becomes large due to large higher dimensional volume of @xmath45 with @xmath47 .",
    "this situation suggests that planck scale @xmath43 is no longer fundamental scale .",
    "however , the large gap between the electroweak and planck scale is compensated by the large compactification scale of the extra dimensions .",

    "the summation over kaluza - klein modes can be calculated without specifying any specific process .",
    "since the kk tower is an infinite sum , ultraviolet divergences are present in tree level process .",
    "thus we need a cutoff procedure . for phenomenological applications following",

    "fig.[fig2 ] shows the cross sections with and without kk graviton exchange versus the minimum transverse momenta ( or @xmath76 cut ) of the final leptons for @xmath77 gev .",
    "it is clear from the fig.[fig2 ] that the deviation from the sm gets higher as the @xmath76 cut increases .",
    "an important thing that has to be stressed here is the correlation between the acceptance region and the @xmath76 cut .",
    "when fig.[fig2](a ) and fig.[fig2](c ) are compared , we see that the acceptance region @xmath75 has almost the same feature as the region @xmath3 with @xmath78 gev .",
    "this means that a high lower bound of the acceptance region mimics an extra @xmath76 cut .     as a function of the transverse momentum cut of the final leptons with and without kk graviton exchange for @xmath77 gev and for three acceptance regions of forward detectors .",

    ", taking acceptance region @xmath75 is good enough to feel the kk graviton exchange in the process @xmath36 via two photon fusion .",
    "when wider acceptance regions with smaller lower bound is considered it is far better to use high lepton @xmath76 cut to supress sm contributions .     as a function of integrated lhc luminosity for two acceptance regions shown in plots ( a ) and ( b ) . in the plot ( b )",

    "an alternative way to handle the large hierarchy between electroweak and gravity scales is the one proposed by randall and sundrum in which curvature in higher dimensions is responsible for removing this large hierarchy .",
