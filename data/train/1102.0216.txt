    "the theory of quantum fields in an expanding universe has evolved from its pioneering years @xcite into a necessary tool in order to describe the universe on large scales .",
    "the de sitter background - characterized by the hubble parameter @xmath1 being constant in time ( for the flat spatial slice ) , where @xmath2 is the scale factor of a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmological model - has been the main arena to compute quantum effects even before becoming a pillar of our understanding of the early inflationary stage and of the recent acceleration of the universe .",
    "however , while @xmath3 for any inflationary model , @xmath4 may not become zero in a viable model , apart from some isolated moments of time .",
    "indeed , the standard slow - roll expression for the power spectrum of the adiabatic mode of primordial scalar ( density ) perturbations becomes infinite , i.e. , meaningless , if @xmath5 becomes zero during inflation .",
    "therefore , the study of quantum effects in a nearly de sitter stage with @xmath6 , in particular , when the total change in @xmath7 during inflation is not small compared with its value during the last e - folds of inflation @xcite ( see also the recent papers @xcite ) , is not of just pure theoretical interest .    in general inflationary model quantum scalar field",
    "can be split into a long wave ( coarse grained ) component and a short - wave ( perturbative ) one .",
    "then it can be proved that the former component effectively becomes quasi - classical , though random ( i.e. all non - commutative parts of it may be neglected ) , and it experiences a random walk described by the stochastic inflation approach @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that just because of the non - perturbative nature of the stochastic approach to inflation , it is based on a number of heuristic approximations .",
    "therefore , it is very important to check , whenever possible , results obtained by its application using the standard perturbative qft in curved space - time .    in this paper we discuss , following the result of @xcite , the diffusion equation for general scalar fluctuations in a generic model of inflation .",
    "on using the results obtained by field theory methods , we show that the stochastic diffusion equation for the canonical gauge invariant variables associated with these generic scalar fluctuations should be formulated in terms of the number of e - folds @xmath8 .",
    "we then tackle in more detail the moduli problem issue .",
    "following @xcite we consider the stochastic growth of different test fields as massive minimally coupled scalar fields , massless non - minimally coupled scalar fields and moduli with an effective mass @xmath9 , in different inflationary models . on the other hand , it is known @xcite that the mean square of gauge invariant mukhanov variable @xcite grows ; it is therefore interesting to compare the amplification of the test fields above not only with the background inflaton dynamics , but also with the stochastic growth of this gauge invariant fluctuation .",
    "this comparison aims for a self - consistent understanding of quantum foam during inflation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe a two field model with two generic self - interacting potentials , each of them depends on one field only , introducing the field theory approach . in section iii",

    "the degrees of freedom above are in part redundant . to obtain a set of well defined equations ( einstein equations + equations of motion of the matter sector ) , order by order , we have , for example , to set to zero two modes of scalar perturbations . the choice of such variables is called a choice of `` gauge '' .    in this case , the study of the scalar sector can be reduced to the study of two different gauge invariant variables .",
    "let us choice , as one of these , the so - called mukhanov variable @xmath17 @xcite , which is usually used to canonically quantize the einstein - klein - gordon lagrangian .",
    "the mukhanov variable can be seen , order by order , as the scalar field fluctuations @xmath18 on uniform curvature hypersurface ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to first order ,",

    "this usage of different time variables should not be mixed with the invariance of all physical results with respect to a ( deterministic ) time reparametrization @xmath27 which is trivially satisfied after taking the corresponding change in the metric lapse function into account .",
