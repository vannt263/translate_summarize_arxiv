    "let us first recall some classical properties of the solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath0 can be obtained by using the fourier transform as follows @xmath1 there are two properties that follow from the above representation .",
    "the first one is the conservation of the @xmath2 norm : @xmath3 the second one is the so - called _ dispersive _ property , which shows that the solutions of system decay as time increases : @xmath4 these simple properties can be used to obtain more refined estimates for the linear semigroup",
    ". there are properties of gain on integrability / regularity with respect to the initial data : the strichartz estimates and the so - called local smoothing property .",
    "we state them here in their simplest form .",
    "similar estimates can be written for the inhomogenous problem by using the @xmath5 argument and eventually christ - kiselev s argument @xcite .",
    "for any initial data in @xmath2 strichartz s estimates state that the solutions of satisfy @xmath6 a scaling argument forces the following admissibility condition for the pairs @xmath7 : @xmath8 the local smoothing property means that the linear semigroup gains locally a one - half space derivative with respect to the initial data : @xmath9    the above estimates play a crucial role in proving the well - posedness of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we recall here only one result in this direction @xcite and the interested reader should consult the classical references @xcite . for any initial data in @xmath2 and @xmath10 there",
    "exists a unique solution @xmath11 of the equation @xmath12    in this paper we analyze the dispersion property in the context of discrete equations and of the equations on graphs .",
    "similar estimates in the spirit of and can also be obtained .",
    "let us consider the discrete schrdinger equation @xmath13 where , for any function @xmath14 , the discrete laplacian @xmath15 acts as follows : @xmath16 in this paper we will not discuss the possible numerical approximation of the nse as in @xcite where there is a parameter @xmath17 , the mesh size , that it is going to zero .    in the case of the discrete equation the solutions decay as follows :    [ stefanov](@xcite ) for any @xmath18 the solution of system satisfies @xmath19    similar to the case of the real line we can write the solution of system as a convolution : @xmath20 where @xmath21 using a classical result for oscillatory integrals , the van der corput lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) , we have that @xmath22 this is a consequence of the fact that the second and the third derivatives of the phase function @xmath23 do not vanish simultaneously at the same point : @xmath24 . observe that @xmath25 for some positive constant , so , for any @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 this implies a decay property for @xmath28 in the @xmath29-norm similar to the one in @xmath30 however , in @xcite the authors show that this decay property can be improved as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 \\frac{p-1}{3p } , & p\\in ( 4,\\infty ] .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] discrete equations on positive integers can also be considered @xmath33 one may also impose dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions at @xmath34 : @xmath35 or @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the solutions of these systems have similar decay .    in a joint paper with d. stan @xcite we considered the case of two discrete schrdinger equations coupled at @xmath37 : @xmath38    in the particular case",
    "when @xmath39 the solution of system can be written in terms of the solutions of some dirichlet and neumann problems .",
    "thus , it decays with the same power @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "there are some difficulties . in matrix formulation system",
    "can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 since the matrix is not diagonal we can not use the fourier transform .",
    "we use the explicit form of the resolvent @xmath45 and spectral calculus to write the following limiting absorption principle for @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 . using this representation",
    "we obtain that the solutions of system also decay as @xmath40 . to prove the decay property it is enough to show that for any @xmath49 $ ] there is a positive constant @xmath50 such that the following @xmath51 holds for any real numbers @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that we want an estimate that should be uniform with respect to the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 . to obtain that we use previous improvements of the van der corput lemma given in @xcite and new ones .",
    "full details are given in @xcite .",
    "many questions can arise regarding the problems discussed above .",
    "using matrices , the discrete equations can be rewritten as follows : @xmath55 we can assume that matrix @xmath56 has a few non - identical vanishing diagonals .",
    "one of the questions that arises here is the following : what properties of matrix @xmath56 guarantee the decay of the solutions of system ?",
    "we admit that also other types of decay may appear @xmath57 , @xmath58 , etc ... in the case when @xmath56 is a diagonal matrix we can use fourier analysis to reduce the question to the study of the roots of some trigonometric polynomials",
    ". it will be interesting to see how resolvent estimates similar to those in @xcite used in the continuous case can be obtained and used in the matrix case .",
    "the analysis of system has been mainly done in the context of the @xmath59 decay of the solutions .",
    "it is still possible to refine the analysis to obtain better estimates as those in @xcite .",
    "we have mainly analyzed the particular case of two discrete equations coupled at one point , but more general coupling conditions can be used or more coupled equations can be considered .",
    "we recall here @xcite where some discrete models on trees have been analyzed .",
    "in this section we present some results concerning the schrdinger equation on graphs .",
    "the results obtained until now concern trees , i.e. graphs without cycles , having the last generation of edges formed from infinite strips . for a graph @xmath60",
    "we consider the following equation @xmath61 \\bu(0,x)=\\bu_0(x ) , &    x\\in \\gamma .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for the precise definition of operator @xmath62 we refer to @xcite . denoting @xmath63 system means that on each edge @xmath64 of the graph we have a schrdinger equation for @xmath65 and at any vertex @xmath66 we couple the equations on the edges that enter into @xmath67 by assuming for example , kirchhoff s law : continuity and sum of the normal derivatives to be zero .",
    "other coupling conditions can be imposed : @xmath68 or @xmath69 coupling as in @xcite or those given in @xcite .",
    "the first result regarding the dispersion property on trees has been obtained in @xcite where the case of regular trees has been considered .",
    "the regular trees are special trees where all the edges in the same generation have the same length and all the vertices in the same generation have the same number of children . in this case",
    "we can make averages of the solutions defined in the same generation and reduce the analysis of dispersion on the tree to the case of the schrdinger equation on the real line with a piecewise constant coefficient @xmath70 , @xmath71 . when the coefficient @xmath70 is given by a finite number of piecewise constant functions we have the following result",
    ".    consider a partition of the real axis @xmath72 and a step function @xmath73 where @xmath74 are positive numbers .",
    "the solution @xmath75 of the schrdinger equation @xmath76 u(0,x)=\\varphi(x ) , & x\\in \\rr , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] satisfies the dispersion inequality @xmath77      the case of the star - shaped tree has been considered in @xcite not only with the classical kirchhoff s coupling , but also with the @xmath68 and @xmath69 coupling .",
    "the advantage of the star - shaped tree is that explicit formulas can be easily obtained for the resolvent @xmath78 and then for the solutions of system .",
    "classical results for oscillatory integrals allow us to obtain the dispersion property more easily .    the case of general trees with kirchhoff s coupling has been considered in @xcite . in contrast to the case of the star - shaped tree",
    ", the resolvent is written in an implicit way by using results for almost periodic functions .",
    "the same problem with @xmath68-coupling has been treated in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in the particular case of a tree with all internal vertices having degree two this type of coupling corresponds to the schrdinger equation on the real line where the laplacian has been perturbed by a sum of dirac deltas : @xmath79 under some technical assumptions on the strengths @xmath80 and on the lengths of the intervals @xmath81 that exclude the existence of resonances ( @xcite ) it has been proved that @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the projection on the continuous part of the spectrum of @xmath84",
    ". a similar analysis can be performed on a tree with delta coupling conditions at the vertices .",
    "the interested reader cans check all the details in @xcite .",
    "the analysis offered so far concerns kirchhoff s coupling or the @xmath68-coupling .",
    "the @xmath69-coupling has been only considered in the case of a star - shaped tree @xcite . in the case of metric graphs , there are various types of coupling conditions that introduce a self - adjoint version of the laplace operator @xmath85 . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that for the coupling @xmath86 the following conditions are necessary and sufficient : @xmath87 has maximal rank , i.e. @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for all vertices @xmath67 of the graph @xmath90 .",
    "as far as we know up to now , the dispersion property has not been proved under general coupling conditions not even on star shaped trees .",
    "one of the problems that emerges from the previous analysis is how to obtain some kind of dispersion when the graphs have cycles .",
    "we recall that in the case of a compact manifold without boundary @xcite is was proved that the dispersion property holds for small intervals of time depending on the range of the eigenfunctions taken by the initial data . in the case of one - dimensional torus",
    "@xmath91 this was already known ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.3 ) : @xmath92 the existence of an argument based on oscillatory integrals that allows us to obtain the dispersion for @xmath91 on small time intervals gives us hope that in the case of graphs with cycles similar results could be obtained .",
    "in fact , for very particular structures as those in @xcite the analysis performed in @xcite shows that the dispersion holds for small intervals of time .",
    "the full understanding of the dispersion phenomena when a periodic structure is combined with infinite lines , i.e. a graph with few infinite external edges that contains a cycle , remains to be investigated . in this context",
    "we recall the case of a cylinder that was considered in @xcite .",
    "another model that can be considered on a graph structure is dirac s equation : @xmath93 where @xmath94.\\ ] ] as far as we know the dispersion property for this equation on graphs / trees has not been considered previously .",
