    "the design process of any spacecraft necessarily includes a thermal analysis , performed to guarantee that both the bus and the payload are kept along the whole mission within the appropriate temperature range @xcite .",
    "the thermal environment of a satellite in orbit is very harsh , dominated by vacuum conditions which make difficult to find a way of cooling down the components of the spacecraft .",
    "every single element of the satellite has to be thermally analysed to verify that its requirements are fulfilled . to do it",
    ", it is necessary a rather detailed design of the spacecraft , as it implies to calculate thermal loads and couplings between elements .",
    "this is usually carried out by commercial software tools based on numerical methods .    during the generic trade - off study ,",
    "early in the design process , that is , when the concept of the spacecraft is still open , it is very convenient to assess the mean temperature of the satellite and its variation by means of analytical tools .",
    "this method provides valuable information about the feasibility of the spacecraft from the thermal point of view as well as the possibility of easily carrying out parametric analyses to study the influence of the different variables involved in the problem .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to analyse the thermal behaviour of a small compact satellite spinning in a low orbit round a solar system planet ( the earth , say ) as a function of time , using analytical or semi - analytical tools . in orbit ,",
    "the spacecraft is subjected to periodic heat loads and it is expected to reach a thermally periodic state .",
    "apart from obtaining the temperature oscillations once reached this periodic state , this analytical approach allows us to study the convergence of the satellite temperature to the periodic behaviour starting from different initial conditions , as it can occur from launch conditions or orbital manoeuvres .",
    "the results are obtained by applying the energy balance equation to the satellite , taking into account both the external heat loads , i.e. the solar irradiation , the planet albedo ( solar irradiation reflected on the planet ) and the infrared ( ir ) radiation from the planet , as well as the internal dissipation .",
    "we begin with the formulation of the energy balance equation as a non - dimensional ordinary differential equation ( ode ) , which is nonlinear and non - autonomous .",
    "then , we consider an autonomous ode that plays the role of an average of the actual equation . that autonomous equation is exactly soluble and guides our intuition of the behaviour of the actual equation and helps in its analysis .",
    "this analysis is carried out with qualitative , perturbation and numerical methods .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions , regarding the design of satellites .",
    "let us assume that the satellite is approximately isothermal , so we characterize it by its temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the heat input consists of an external flow coming from the space environment , in particular , the solar irradiation , the planetary albedo and the planetary ir radiation , and the internal heat due to the equipment dissipation .",
    "the solar irradiation and the planetary albedo have periodic variation , according to the position of the satellite on its orbit . on the contrary ,",
    "the planetary ir radiation and the internal heat operate at constant rate .",
    "let us assume that the solar irradiation changes from constant to vanishing ( when the satellite is in the planet s shade ) , whereas the albedo depends on the angle between the sunlight and the vertical to the satellite ( and is much smaller in absolute value ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the albedo vanishes for one fraction of a period whereas the satellite s night ( when it is in the planet s shade ) lasts for another ( smaller ) fraction .",
    "we denote the heat rate due to solar irradiation by @xmath1 , and the maximum albedo heat rate by @xmath2 ( at the satellite s noon ) .",
    "in addition , let the constant rate source have power @xmath3 ( the sum of the equipment dissipation and planetary ir radiation ) .",
    "then , the energy balance equation that yields the temperature @xmath0 is @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the satellite s thermal capacity , @xmath6 the orbital frequency , @xmath7 is the satellite s surface area , @xmath8 its emissivity , and @xmath9 the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 are smaller than one half and they determine the fractions of the period with vanishing albedo or sunshine , respectively . in principle , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( we assume that the albedo vanishes for half a period whereas the satellite s night is shorter : we take it as one fifth of the period , that is , @xmath14 , in an example below )",
    ".    we can write this equation in non - dimensional form by defining @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and non - dimensional temperature variable @xmath19 and time variable @xmath20 ( which we still denote @xmath21 for notational simplicity )",
    ". then , @xmath22 unfortunately , this nonlinear ode can not be reduced to a quadrature ; but we can deduce its relevant properties , nevertheless .",
    "we note that , if we remove the oscillating terms , the resulting equation @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 ) is immediately reduced to a quadrature , which can be integrated analytically .",
    "moreover , we can deduce the qualitative behaviour of the solutions in a straightforward way : there is one fixed point , @xmath25 , and it is stable .",
    "it is the equilibrium temperature , at which the heat input and the radiation output balance one another .",
    "when the temperature is close to it , @xmath26 , we obtain the linear ode @xmath27 with solution @xmath28 therefore , @xmath29 halves in a time @xmath30 ; and the larger is @xmath31 , the shorter it takes to reach equilibrium .",

    "in this section , we first present a qualitative analysis , which allows us to prove the existence of an attracting limit cycle . to obtain the transient behaviour and the properties of the limit cycle , we employ perturbation theory .",
    "finally , we perform a numerical analysis of the ode , to check the results of the preceding methods and to obtain concrete and more precise numerical results",
    ".      equation ( [ ode ] ) is non - autonomous and therefore equivalent to an autonomous system of two ode s , namely , the system formed by eq .",
    "( [ ode ] ) and the trivial equation @xmath36 .",
    "the generic behaviour of an autonomous system of two first - order ode s is to have `` simple '' attracting sets , namely , equilibrium points or limit cycles , because of the poincar - bendixson theorem @xcite . given the nature of our problem , we can also apply the theory of ode s with periodic coefficients ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : we can reduce the dynamics in the @xmath37-plane to the cylinder @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , we can consider @xmath39 as the radial coordinate and @xmath40 as the angular coordinate of a plane with the origin excluded ( equivalent to the mentioned cylinder ) .",
    "given that there can not be fixed points ( since the equation @xmath36 forbids it ) , the poincar - bendixson theorem implies that the only possible attractors are limit cycles , with the period imposed by the heat input .",
    "the poincar - bendixson theorem states that a curve solution of a two - dimensional autonomous ode that has no singularities ( e.g. , fixed points ) and is contained in a compact domain for all @xmath41 approaches a limit cycle .",
    "we use a consequence of this theorem : given two concentric closed curves limiting an annular region that is free of singularities and such that the vector of derivatives on the two curves points towards the inside of the region , there exists a limit cycle in this annulus .    to prove the uniqueness of the limit cycle",
    ", we appeal to dulac s criterion for an annular region : if the autonomous system @xmath42 is such that the divergence @xmath43 has constant sign in an annular region , then this region contains at most one limit cycle .",
    "the proof of this criterion follows from green s theorem @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that eq .",
    "( [ ode ] ) is such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , for all @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the equilibrium temperatures with _ constant _ minimum or maximum heat input , respectively .",
    "therefore , the trajectories in the plane with @xmath39 as the radial coordinate and @xmath40 as the angular coordinate which begin inside the annulus defined by those two temperatures are confined in it , and there is ( at least ) one limit cycle ( with an oscillation in @xmath39 confined to take place within those values ) . furthermore , this limit cycle is unique , because @xmath48    the trajectories inside the annulus are alternately increasing and decreasing , as the right - hand side of eq .",

    "[ plot ] .    using @xmath39 as the radial coordinate and @xmath40 as the angular coordinate , fig .",
    "[ plot ] becomes the polar plot in fig .",
    "[ polar - plot ] .",
    "this polar plot is more useful to represent convergence to the limit cycle in a standard way .",
    "we are interested in two questions : ( i ) finding the features of the limit cycle and the rate of convergence to it ; ( ii ) analysing how this limit cycle and the rate of convergence depend on the constants @xmath51 .",
    "these questions can not be answered by a qualitative analysis , so we turn to other methods .    however , let us note that some more qualitative information can be obtained from a comparison with the non - oscillating eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) : if @xmath52 is sensibly smaller than one , the convergence time @xmath53 is large , so that it is consistent to consider eq .",

    "( [ ode ] ) as a perturbation of eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) , namely , to consider the time - dependent ( oscillating ) functions @xmath55 as a perturbation .",

    "as we have explained above , our intention is to take advantage of the simple solution of eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) by taking it as the basis of a perturbation scheme .",
    "therefore , we write eq .",
    "( [ ode ] ) as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a formal perturbation parameter to be set to one at the end .",
    "note that @xmath60 is defined such that it has vanishing average over a period and , therefore , it represents the deviations about the mean value @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ode - pert ] ) must fulfill the initial condition @xmath61 .",
    "we assume an expansion of @xmath62 of the form @xmath63 and substitute it into eq .",

    "these ode s can be solved subsequently , namely , we can solve first the equation for @xmath65 and , then , we can solve the equation for @xmath68 and so onwards .",
    "of course , the equation for @xmath65 is eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) , which we have already solved .",
    "the following equations are just first - order linear inhomogeneous equations , which are soluble by quadratures @xcite .",

    "( [ linode - sol ] ) , namely , @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the integral in @xmath70 becomes a sum of integrals of exponential functions , which yield exponential functions again . in the large-@xmath21 limit ( when @xmath72 ) , the exponentials decay and the value of @xmath70 further simplifies to @xmath73 .",

    "this estimation can be useful in the conceptual design of the satellite .",

    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ max - a ] ) and ( [ max - b ] ) coincide if @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , the preceding method relies on the particular form of @xmath60 , namely , it is close to a step function .",
    "this is the reason why the method yields a good result .",
    "of course , while still using the approximation leading to eq .",
    "( [ fourier - sol - approx ] ) , the preceding method is improved by the formula @xmath108 which demands a little more work to yield the maximum value of @xmath109 .",
    "better approximations to @xmath109 are possible by considering @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ fourier - sol ] ) , that is to say , by considering the displacement of @xmath82 [ @xmath110 . in a different sense , the approximation is also improved by carrying on the perturbation scheme to the second order .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) is similar to eq .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , if we consider @xmath111 and ( the square of ) the first order solution as the forcing term .",
    "therefore , a similar reasoning leads us to the existence of a periodic solution for @xmath112 in the large-@xmath21 limit , which can be obtained by fourier analysis .",
    "the result is @xmath113    we can see that the perturbation series is a power series in the fourier coefficients of the forcing term and its convergence depends on the magnitude of this term . given that this term is proportional to @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the convergence of the series is improved when these constants are small .",
    "this condition is related to the one that we found for eq .",
    "( [ ode2 ] ) to hold as an average equation , namely , that @xmath57 is small .",

    "let us see what values are adequate for a small satellite that is orbiting round the earth and which can be considered isothermal .",
    "we can take the satellite to be a cube of @xmath117  m side and mass of 50  kg .",
    "let us assume that it is mostly covered by solar cells .",
    "then , suitable values for the absorptivity and emissivity are @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "we assume the satellite s average specific thermal capacity to be 0.2  w  h  kg@xmath120  k@xmath120 ( corresponding to a composition of alluminium with some plastic ) .",

    "the albedo is very variable , and to calculate @xmath2 , it is necessary , in addition , to consider the _ visibility factor_. we take an average value of @xmath125 so @xmath126 .",
    "the constant heat input is the sum of the equipment dissipation plus the planetary ir irradiation input .",
    "the equipment dissipation power is due to the transformation of the incoming irradiation power .",
    "if we assume that the solar cells cover 80% of the satellite s surface and their efficiency is about 10% , and we take into account that the solar irradiation only holds for a fraction @xmath127 of the period , we deduce that the power dissipated is about 30  w. the planetary ir irradiation input can be estimated by applying the energy balance to the planet ( earth ) .",
    "this balance yields an ir radiation flux of about 7% of the solar constant .",
    "we can take the absorptivity in the ir to be similar to the emissivity @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the planetary ir irradiation is about 23  w and @xmath128  w.    summarizing , we can take @xmath98 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "furthermore , we consider seven values of the initial condition @xmath131 ( @xmath95 is the noon ) uniformly distributed in the interval 273  k @xmath132 300  k , corresponding to nondimensional @xmath133 .",

    "the convergence time is @xmath138 .",
    "[ plot ] clearly shows that the evolution is given by an oscillation with unit period superimposed to a slower and approximately exponential convergence in a time @xmath139 .    to measure precisely the attractor characteristics , we choose the initial condition @xmath140 and we let the numerical integration up to @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting solution has @xmath142 , which is slightly different from @xmath143 ( although the difference is inappreciable with two - digit precision ) . of course , the solution with @xmath144 is the limit cycle .",
    "it has local minimum and maximum amplitudes 0.58 and 0.60 at @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "those extreme values are quite close , considering the interval defined by @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( see fig .  [ plot ] ) .",
    "the limit cycle is plotted in fig .",
    "[ lin_approx ] .",
    "regarding the problem of heat transfer in a satellite , the main conclusions that we can draw from our analysis are the following .",
    "first of all , as regards the temperature stability , it holds in the sense of convergence to the limit cycle behaviour , guaranteed by the application of the poincar - bendixson theorem and dulac s criterion for an annular region .",
    "moreover , the convergence is exponential .",
    "the limit cycle behaviour has a time dependence related to the periodic heat input , namely , approximately similar to its integral , but somewhat displaced . to be precise",
    ", the limit cycle consists , in one period , of a temperature - growing phase when the solar heat input is on ( as is the albedo ) , and a relaxation phase in which the temperature falls to adjust to the constant input @xmath3 ( although this phase ends long before the temperature approaches the corresponding equilibrium value ) .",
    "the total amplitude of the temperature oscillation is relatively small in the example that we have studied .",
    "this example , with realistic values of the non - dimensional constants @xmath116 for a low - orbit small satellite ( reasonably small values , in particular ) , shows that the attractor is approached exponentially but in a time reasonably larger than the period .",
    "this time is simply given in terms of @xmath116 by @xmath149 , where @xmath150 . moreover , the mean temperature in the limit cycle is @xmath151 .",
    "it is useful to compare the mean temperature @xmath54 with the oscillation about it .",
    "the former depends on @xmath32 , namely , the average of @xmath152 , whereas the latter depends on @xmath60 , which is the oscillation of @xmath153 ( @xmath154 is a constant ) .",
    "thus , the temperature oscillation is independent of @xmath154 ( the constant heat input ) .",
    "this constant is bound to be quite smaller than @xmath114 , for physical reasons , since the equipment dissipation power is due to the transformation of the incoming solar irradiation power , and the ir irradiation input is a fraction of the solar input .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath155 , and we assume that @xmath156 .",
    "in conclusion , the main contributions to @xmath32 and , therefore , to @xmath54 are due to @xmath114 . if the temperature oscillation is estimated by eqs .",
    "( [ max - a ] ) or ( [ max - b ] ) , the main contribution to it also seems to be due to @xmath114 ; except for the factor @xmath157 , which can be small .",

    "( [ max - a ] ) yields a larger value than eq .",
    "( [ max - b ] ) if @xmath158 , which always holds .",
    "focusing on eq .",
    "( [ max - a ] ) , we note that the coefficient @xmath157 of @xmath114 is smaller than the coefficient of @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath10 approaches @xmath159 , we only have the @xmath115-term : then the satellite is always under the solar irradiation , which does not oscillate ; in consequence , the temperature oscillation is only due to the albedo and , therefore , is depressed .",
    "let us express the temperature oscillation given by eq .",
    "( [ max - a ] ) in physical variables : @xmath160_{\\rm max } = a^{-1/3}\\,{{\\t}_1}_{\\rm max } = x_1\\frac{(1 - 2x_1 ) \\dot{q}_s + ( 1 - 1/\\pi ) \\dot{q}_a}{c\\nu}\\,.\\ ] ] contrary to the expression of @xmath161 in eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) , this expression depends on @xmath5 and @xmath6 but it does not depend on @xmath162 and @xmath9 . we expect both expressions to be very useful for conceptual thermal design .    of course , in the numerical example in sect .",
    "[ num - sol ] we have not considered every orbital circumstance and we have just intended to find a set of sensible values for the constants .",
    "more information on satellite design and the space thermal environment can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss briefly here possible changes of the values of @xmath114 and @xmath154 . while the ratio @xmath163 is adequate for a small satellite , the absolute values of @xmath164 can be amply changed ; for example , by increasing the period ( which we have taken as 1.5  h in our case ) .",
    "it is easy to see that both @xmath114 and @xmath154 are proportional to the @xmath165rd - power of the period .",
    "thus , if we increase the period by a factor of ten , say , the constants increase by a factor of @xmath166 , so that @xmath167 decreases by a factor of ten , becoming smaller than one ( the period ) .",
    "in this situation , the convergence to the limit cycle is very fast .",
    "in fact , it is appropriate to consider the opposite approximation to the temperature evolution , namely , during the decay to the limit cycle , the temperature only changes slightly along this limit cycle .",
    "further analysis could be based on a more refined model than the isothermal model that we have used .",
    "in particular , a _ two - node _ model has been studied by guerra , prez - grande and sanz @xcite .",
    "the two ode s for the two - node model are equivalent to an autonomous system of three ode s .",
    "as is well known , such system can have chaotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "however , we expect that the situations that are well approximated by the one - node model that we have analysed do not exhibit chaotic features and , therefore , can be conveniently studied , and provide , in addition , a basis for this very simple model ."
