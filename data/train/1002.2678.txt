    "electromechanical nano - switches as integral parts of nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) find numerous technological applications as , e.g. , mass memory storage , high - frequency electrical switches , and mass or force sensors . such high technological applications demand combined efforts of engineering and science through modelling and simulations . hence ,",
    "to design state - of - the - art nanotechnological devices with predetermined characteristics , engineers need in addition to experimental techniques not only new formulas and computational methods but also improved electromechanical models .",
    "the new models must account for the nonlocal properties of the materials and new physical phenomena .",
    "the nonlocality appears due to the noticeable role of interatomic forces in nano - objects . in nonlocal theories ,",
    "the constitutive equations take into account microstructure of real materials and microscopic interaction length between , e.g. , molecules in a lattice . from the physical point of view",
    ", the nonlocality exhibits through special size - dependent effects such as , for example , flexoelectricity - induced polarization due to the strain gradient .",
    "it is well known that conventional continuum theories are size - independent and therefore can not be applied automatically for the analysis of nems devices .",
    "the most suitable tools for their analysis are atomic and molecular models , but they are restricted by their computational capacity .",
    "one of the ways to resolve this contradiction consists in the employment of improved , size - dependent classical theories [ 1 ] .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider both piezoelectric and flexoelectric cases . in the latter case ,",
    "a nonuniform strain field may locally break inversion symmetry and induce polarization . to take into account this effect , similar to [ 1 ] , we assume that the electric enthalpy density depends not only on strain , electric field , and polarization but also on strain gradient . then , we replace the polarization by its linear representations through the electric field and strain . using hamilton s principle , we obtain the equations of motion for euler - bernoulli and timoshenko beams as well as for 2-d plate .",
    "the higher order terms in the strain from the electric enthalpy density give additional contribution to the bending rigidity of the beam compared to classical solution .",
    "the analysis shows that taking into account the strain gradient increases the elastic characteristics of the nano - switch considered in this work . from the obtained formulas it is seen that at reducing dimensions to the nanoscale the flexoelectric effect plays more significant role than piezoelectric effect . in the dynamic case ,",
    "the euler - bernoulli beam model provides overestimated frequencies .",
    "two - dimensional model allows us to evaluate the electric potential accumulated in the nano - switch due to induced nonuniform strain .",
    "electromechanical nano - switch may be simulated as a dielectric cantilever nanobeam ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the material of the beam may have tetragonal or cubic symmetry or in another words it may be piezo- or nonpiezoelectric .",
    "first , let us consider flexoelectric properties of the beam . in @xcite-@xcite the fourth - order flexoelectric tensor",
    "is introduced in two different ways : as @xmath0 @xmath1 or as @xmath2 in the additional term in the thermodynamic potential @xcite : @xmath3    here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , are the components of the strain , dielectric , and relative permittivity tensors , respectively , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are the components of polarization , displacement , and electric field vectors , respectively , @xmath10 is the permittivity of vacuum .    in @xcite",
    "there is a structure of the flexoelectric coefficients for a cubic material ( in matrix notation ) : @xmath11    according to @xcite and @xcite , the electric enthalpy may be presented in the form @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an energy density of deformation and polarization , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath2 , @xmath20 are the components of reciprocal dielectric susceptibility , polarization gradient - polarization gradient coupling tensor , elastic tensor , piezoelectric tensor , polarization gradient - strain coupling tensor , flexoelectric tensor , and polarization - polarization gradient coupling tensor , respectively , @xmath21 is the potential of electric field .",
    "since the components of the stress tensor and the electric field vector @xmath22 are expressed as @xmath23 we have @xmath24 compare ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ccc1 ] ) , and the second equation of ( [ eq : c3 ] ) , we conclude that flexoelectric tensor @xmath2 has 21 nonzero components : @xmath25 in this work , we do not consider the terms with @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 coefficients although it might be done without difficulties .    using the equations ( [ eq : c1])-([eq : c3 ] ) we derive the equations of motion for a dielectric nanoswitch .    here",
    "we consider a cantilever switch which may be presented as a euler - bernoulli or timoshenko beam or 2-d narrow plate ( fig .",
    "the load applied to the free edge of the cantilever simulates the case of nonuniform strain .",
    "within the framework of the euler - bernoulli model , the displacement can be written as @xmath26 hence , based on the equations ( [ eq : c0 ] ) , the strains are equal to @xmath27 we assume that the electric field acts only in @xmath28direction",
    ". then , from ( [ eq : c3 ] ) we can express @xmath29 as @xmath30 or @xmath31 where the low letter indexes after a comma mean the derivation with respect to corresponding coordinates .    after substituting the equations ( [ eq : c5 ] ) , ( [ eq : c6 ] ) , into ( [ eq : c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c2 ] ) and ignoring the polarization gradient , we have @xmath32 the equation of motion of the beam",
    "are derived via hamilton s principle @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the first variation , @xmath35 is the kinetic energy , and @xmath36 is the work done by the external forces and moments .",
    "the kinetic energy of the beam by using the equation ( [ eq : c0 ] ) can be written as @xmath37dv_b= \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{1}{2}\\varrho \\int_{0}^{l}[(\\dot{w})^2 a+i(\\dot{w}^{'})^2]dx , \\label{eq : c9 }        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the area of the beam s cross section , @xmath40 is the volume of the beam , @xmath41 is the mass density of the nano - switch s material , and the length of the beam is equal to @xmath42 .",
    "if the beam is under the transverse force @xmath43 , the work done is equal to @xmath44    performing variation in ( [ eq : c8 ] ) and using ( [ eq : c7 ] ) , ( [ eq : c9 ] ) , and ( [ eq:000 ] ) , we obtain the equations describing the electromechanical behavior of the beam @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electric transverse shear force and the electric bending moment , respectively : @xmath49 with the associated boundary conditions + at @xmath50 @xmath51 at @xmath52 @xmath53 and at @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a force applied to the right edge of the cantilever .    the equations ( [ eq : c10 ] ) , ( [ eq : cc10 ] ) and the boundary conditions ( [ eq:001 ] ) - ( [ eq:00002 ] ) couple the mechanical displacement @xmath57 and the electric potential @xmath21 .    from the equation ( [ eq : c10 ] )",
    "it is seen that piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects increase the bending rigidity of the beam ( @xmath58 ) and for the beams with large cross - section area and consequently large its moment of inertia , the term @xmath59 plays insignificant role . however , for small cross - sectional dimensions , when @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the thickness of the beam , the flexoelectric effect becomes noticeable .",
    "the normalized young modulus is @xmath62 it is seen that at @xmath63 the flexoelectric term plays the dominant role in the bending rigidity .",
