    "( [ condlw ] ) and ( [ derspec ] ) the longitudinal photoconductivity contains a new contribution proportional to the derivative of the density of states : @xmath235 . due to the oscillatory structure of the density of states",
    "this extra contribution takes both positive and negative values .",
    "this term is proportional to the electron mobility , hence for sufficiently high mobility the new contribution dominates leading to negative conductivity states .    an interesting prediction of the present model is related to polarization effects . while the results for the cases of linear transverse or longitudinal polarization s show small differences , the selection of circular polarized radiation leads to significant signatures .",
    "the maximum possible value for the oscillation amplitudes of @xmath25 appears for negative circular polarization .",
    "instead , positive circular polarization yields an important reduction on the oscillation amplitudes and the total disappearance of the ncs .",
    "this result can be understood , if one recalls that for negative circular polarization and @xmath240 the electric field rotates in phase with respect to the electron cyclotron rotation .    in conclusion",
    ", it is proposed that the combined effect of a perpendicular magnetic field plus the irradiation of lateral superlattices can give rise to interesting oscillatory conductance phenomena , with the possible development of negative conductance states @xmath23 .",
    "one should stress that according to our results , the production of ncs requires ultra - clean samples with electron mobilties of order @xmath231 ( see fig .",
