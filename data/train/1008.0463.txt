    "quantum transport in periodically driven mesoscopic systems is currently of great interest because of an increasing number of applications .",

    "there exists a good theoretical understanding of the tunnelling events in the presence of an alternating ( ac ) field , i.e. , the floquet theory ,  shirley , li , moskalets , moskalets2 which takes the photon - assisted transport into account and allows us to convert the solution of a time - periodic schrdinger equation into a time - independent eigenvalue problem . for systems with time - periodic potentials ,",
    "inelastic tunnelling occurs when electrons at appropriate incident fermi energies undergo transitions between the central band to several sidebands by means of photon emission or absorption , referred to as photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) .",
    "the central band just corresponds to particles with the incident fermi energy  while the sidebands correspond to particles which have gained or lost one or more modulation energy quantum .",
    "especially , if the potential is harmonic in time , the pat results in exchange of energy with electrons in units of modulation quantum @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being the modulation frequency",
    ". an important application of the pat is quantum charge pump , which received considerable theoretical investigation and had been observed experimentally.switkes,thouless,niu,wagner,brouwer,wang,zhu,torres,moskalets,moskalets2 however most previous studies in this realm have been focused on the schrdinger system .    in ref.@xcite , the floquet scattering theory was developed for quantum pumping in mesoscopic semiconductors by moskalets and bttiker .",
    "this approach permits description of both adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes of pumping .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to applied the floquet scattering - matrix method to calculating quantum charge pumping in the dirac system . to this end",
    ", we extend the approach of ref.@xcite to accommodate a novel two dimensional hexagonal carbon material , graphene .",
    "recently , the study of quantum pumps in dirac system has been carried out in one dimensional luttinger liquid model  @xcite or weak pumps in the adiabatic regime  @xcite and nonadiabatic regime  @xcite in graphene by using the floquet scattering theory .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice , exhibits abundant new physics and potential applications .",
    "@xcite quantum transport properties in graphene have attracted increasing attentions both for the fundamental physics and potential applications in carbon - based nano - electronics devices .",
    "the novel properties arise from the unique linear dispersion and the chiral nature of its carriers near the dirac points . at the @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) point of the brillouin zone ,",
    "the energy spectrum exhibits a linear dispersion that can be well described by the massless dirac equation with an effective speed of @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite these quasiparticles , called massless dirac fermions , are quite different from the standard electrons that we encounter in conventional two dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "graphene monolayer is a suitable testbed to examine the photon - assisted electron tunneling  @xcite and quantum pumps in the dirac system . in addition",
    ", the high electron mobility and long phase coherence present in graphene could in principle enhance these interference effects ( photon - assisted tunneling and quantum pumps ) , thereby making possible its observation with the present technology .",
    "we carried out a study of quantum pumps in both adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes in graphene monolayer reported here , which helps to obtain a clear physical picture about time - dependent tunneling and will be interesting for the potential application of carbon - based electronic devices .        in this work ,",
    "we study theoretically the charge pump by a series of time - periodic potentials in monolayer graphene with no external bias .",
    "we also find exchange of photons between the oscillating barrier and electrons .",
    "such processes give rise to transitions from the central band to sidebands , all of which can convey the electrons and contribute to the pumped current .",
    "the charge pumping is a consequence of the interference of different propagating modes of which the differences in phase break the time reversal symmetry .",

    "we consider electrons transmitting through a series of modulated pumping potentials in a monolayer graphene sheet .",
    "the charge pumping potentials can be realized by top metallic gates  @xcite or by using the electric field of a surface acoustic wave .",
    "@xcite we approximate the scattering potentials by a sequence of time - periodic rectangular barriers .",

    "the potentials are given by : @xmath5where the superscript @xmath6 indicates the @xmath6-th region ( see fig .",

    "the height of the barrier is oscillating sinusoidally around @xmath7 with amplitude @xmath8 , frequency @xmath1 and phase @xmath9 .",
    "quasiparticles in graphene are formally described by the dirac - like hamiltonian : @xmath10where @xmath11 is the momentum , @xmath12(@xmath13 ) is the pseudospin pauli matrix , and the @xmath14-independent fermi velocity @xmath15 plays the role of the speed of light .",

    "since the time and position dependence of @xmath20 are separated in our model , @xmath21 is separable as @xmath22 .",

    "here we have obtained the wave functions that valid both in the free and oscillating regions in a unified form .",
    "then we can use floquet scattering - matrix formalism ( see appendix .",
    "[ appendix ] ) to calculate the pumped current .      using the distribution function @xmath49 for outgoing particles and @xmath50 for incoming ones",

    "next we consider the adiabatic limitation : @xmath62 .",
    "in this situation , the floquet scattering matrix is almost energy independent when @xmath27 changes by @xmath63 .",
    "we can rewrite the floquet scattering matrix in adiabatic approximation as @xmath64 @xmath65 , and the difference of the fermi distribution as @xmath66 , where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath31-th sideband in which the electrons are scattered to . inserting the above expressions into eq .",

    "( [ eq : piad ] ) .",
    "we can also use the scattering matrix to calculate some other important physical quantities such as the directed heat current , shot noise , wigner delay time .",
    "in this section , we use the above formalism to investigate quantum tunneling through double oscillating barriers schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "fig:1 with only the first two oscillating barriers included .",
    "it is clear that a single time - periodic barrier with time - reversal symmetry can not produce a pumped current .",
    "here we consider only two oscillating potentials which are sufficient to present a clear physical picture .",
    "the heights of the two barriers oscillate in time with the same frequency @xmath1 , amplitude @xmath68 , but with a phase lag @xmath69 .",
    "thus for a pump with @xmath70 ( n is a integer ) , the time - reversal symmetry is broken and a nonzero pumped current can be produced .",
    "to understand the origin of the directed current when the chemical potentials at both sides of the scatterers are equal , we first examine the transmission asymmetry for incoming waves in a certain mode @xmath71 from both sides of the scattering region .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , we plot the transmission asymmetry probability as a function of the phase lag @xmath69 at different incident angles and energies . anisotropic tunneling behavior is observed in this time - periodic case .",
    "note that for normal incidence , @xmath78 is always zero .",
    "this phenomena is the result of klein tunneling i.e. , the incident electrons at both sides of the scatterer can perfectly transmit to the opposite side resulting in the vanish of the transmission asymmetry . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(c ) , we present the transmission asymmetry probability as a function of incident energy under a certain fermi energy @xmath79 ev , while the widths of the barriers are different .",
    "our calculation shows that @xmath78 vanishes gradually as the incident energy decreases , since the influence of the oscillating potentials that break the time - reversal symmetry become negligible when the incident energy is far bellow @xmath80 as well as the oscillating potentials .",
    "the transmission asymmetry probability oscillates more seriously when the barrier is thicker by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a)-(c ) .",
    "this is related to the interference between the multireflections of the electron waves inside the barriers .",
    "so it shows more pronounced resonant tunneling behaviors as the barrier width increases .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the oscillating amplitude @xmath81 and frequency @xmath1 on @xmath82 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](d)-(f ) .",
    "we find that the transmission asymmetry probability can be enlarged both by increasing @xmath81 or @xmath83 for small values of @xmath1 .",
    "such results are obvious since larger @xmath81 gives rise to a greater number of sidebands serving as the transmission modes , while larger @xmath1 gives rise to larger modulation quantum of energy that an electron exchanged with the oscillating potentials during the tunneling processes . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we find that the transmission asymmetry vanishes when the incident energy approaches @xmath80 .",
    "this is because the _ x_-component of the wave vector @xmath84 of the central band and first few sidebands in the barrier are imaginary in the incident energy range closed to @xmath80 .",
    "imaginary wave vectors corresponds to evanescent modes , that decay exponentially and thus lead to total reflection at both sides of the scatterer .",

    "nonzero transmission asymmetry can give rise to a finite charge current .",
    "next we proceed to calculate the pumped current in adiabatic limit : @xmath95 .",
    "the expression of adiabatic pumped current in eq .",
    "( eq : piad ) is valid when the floquet scattering matrix is energy independent on the scale of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "the lager the number @xmath60 of the sidebands included , the smaller the frequencies for which the adiabatic approximation is valid .",
    "as discussed above , @xmath60 is determined by the ratio of the oscillation amplitude to the frequency . in this subsection , we consider a weak pump with @xmath97 . for a strong pump",
    ", @xmath60 is much larger and the adiabatic approximation is valid only at smaller frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we can see that the transmission asymmetry shows a resonance - like behavior of the order of the width @xmath98 ev resonance , indicating that the floquet scattering matrix changes significantly over this energy scale .",
    "therefore we can choose an oscillating frequency of @xmath99 mev , for which the adiabatic approximation requirement @xmath100 is satisfied .",
    "note that at zero temperature the pumped current is dominated by the electrons at the fermi energy .",
    "the pumped current @xmath101 shows similar resonance - like behaviors as transmission asymmetry as expected ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) ) .",
    "@xmath101 oscillates as a function of the fermi energy @xmath17 , becomes smooth and eventually vanishes when the fermi energy approaches the static potential height @xmath80 .",
    "it is much different from that of a conventional quantum pump based on usual nano - scale semiconductors .",
    "this remarkable feature can be attributed to the same reason as the vanished transmission asymmetry when @xmath17 is close to @xmath80 as we examined in the last subsection , i.e. , the transmission probability in graphene through a high barrier is lager than that of a low barrier which is closed to the incident energy .",
    "another difference between the quantum pumps in graphene and that in the conventional two - dimensional electron gas system is that the pumped current in graphene can change from positive to negative or reversely as the energy increases for a constant phase lag , while the direction of conventional pumped current is determined by the phase lag of the to oscillating potentials .",
    "@xcite we also investigated the influence of the geometrical sizes of the oscillating double barriers . in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) and ( c ) , we plot the dependence of adiabatic pumped currents both on the barrier separation @xmath102 and width @xmath103 .",
    "the adiabatic pumped current also oscillates when the barrier separation or width are changed .",
    "this is caused by the fabry - prot resonant modes formed between the interfaces due to the multiple reflections .",
    "@xcite these results agree with the previous work on adiabatic pumping in graphene , e.g. see  @xcite . with increasing pumped frequency , the deviation of the actual pumped current calculated by eq.(eq : pi ) from the adiabatic one calculated by eq.([eq : piad ] ) becomes significant , and thus the adiabatic approximation of eq.([eq : piad ] ) as well as the parametric scattering approach used in ref.@xcite are not valid anymore .",
    "next , we analyze the behavior of non - adiabatic pumped current @xmath104 as a function of phase lag @xmath69 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "the incident electrons are homogeneous in direction under the same fermi energy @xmath105 from both sides of the scatterer .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) shows the general characteristics of quantum pumping in graphene .",
    "the oscillating frequency is set to @xmath106 mev , and thus @xmath107 is of the same order of @xmath108 .",
    "the adiabatic approximation discussed in last subsection is no longer valid .",
    "the sizes of the double oscillating barriers are fixed for @xmath77 nm , @xmath76 nm in the calculation of this subsection .",
    "the numerical results show that the pumped current @xmath104 is sinusoidal or cosinoidal dependence on phase lag @xmath69 .",
    "we find that the static barrier @xmath7 can also effectively control the amplitude and direction of the current as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) .",
    "the height of the static barrier @xmath7 plays an important role in determining the pumping , since it is related to the component of the wave vector along the x - direction in the barrier region . for electron in the @xmath31-th energy sideband @xmath109 ,",
    "the corresponding _",
    "x_-component of the wave vector @xmath110 becomes imaginary .",
    "such electrons are in evanescent sidebands and do not directly contribute to the current . if the static barrier becomes higher , the electronic states outside the barrier match the hole states inside the barrier .",
    "then the transmission modes in the barrier come back to propagating states , resulting in an increasing overall pumped current amplitude .",
    "this phenomena in graphene is different from the transmission in ordinary semiconductor two dimensional electron gas , while there is no available hole state inside the barrier contributing to ordinary tunneling .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig:5](b ) that the pumped current oscillates when the static barrier potential is increased .",
    "this is caused by the fabry - prot resonant modes formed in the double barrier structure due to the multiple reflections .",
    "@xcite    the pumped current can also be tuned by the oscillating amplitude @xmath81 and frequency @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "we find that the pumped current increases with the oscillating amplitude @xmath81 .",
    "this is because a larger @xmath81 can transfer electrons to higher sidebands and thus increase the transmission modes of which the interferences become more intensive .",
    "this behavior is much different from that of an adiabatic pump . in the limit of @xmath62 ,",
    "the adiabatic pumped current is irrespective of the amplitude of the oscillating potentials @xmath81 , however the criterion of adiabatic approximation depends strongly on @xmath81 .",
    "@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) , we inspect the influence of the frequency @xmath1 for several fixed amplitude @xmath81 .",
    "the pumped current shows a trend of rise first , then fall after @xmath1 exceeding @xmath81 . for small @xmath1 , electrons can gain a larger modulation energy quantum from the oscillating potentials with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the interference of sidebands with higher energies gives rise to a lager pumped current . with increasing pumped frequency @xmath111 under a constant oscillating potential @xmath81",
    ", the oscillating double barriers will transform from a strong pump to a weak pump . in the case that @xmath1 is lager than @xmath81 ,",
    "the oscillating pump is too weak to lift the electrons from the central band to any sidebands and thus leads to the drop of the pumped current .",
    "this feature dose not exist in adiabatic pumping regimes , since the pumped frequency @xmath111 is always much smaller than the oscillating potential @xmath81 , and the adiabatic current always increases monotonely with @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite therefore , the non - adiabatic pumped current can be tuned by changing the phase lag , barrier height , oscillating amplitude and frequency .     for different @xmath80 , with @xmath94 mev , @xmath112 mev , @xmath113 mev , @xmath114 .",

    "based on this approach , we investigate theoretically the quantum pumping driven by a series of time - periodic potentials in graphene monolayer both in adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes .",
    "we have determined how the pumped current depends on the phase lag , height of the barrier , frequency and amplitude of the oscillation .",
