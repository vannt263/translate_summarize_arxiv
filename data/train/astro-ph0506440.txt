    "this does not explain the fact that binaries and multiples are common .",

    "it is known that the molecular cloud collapses isothermally until the gas density reaches @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "after the gas density exceeds this , gas becomes adiabatic , because the cloud becomes optically thick against the dust thermal emissions and forms a first core @xcite .",
    "the continuous accretion increases the mass of the first core and thus the gas density increases steadily in the core .",
    "simultaneously , the temperature rises steadily .",
    "finally , molecular hydrogen is dissociated after reaching @xmath4k and @xmath5 .",
    "then the cloud begins to contract again as a result of the endoergic reaction .",
    "the fragmentation of molecular cloud has been investigated by many authors ( for review , see @xcite ) .",
    "majority of researchers have focused on the isothermal clouds .",
    "the initial conditions of the spherical isothermal cloud with uniform density and rigid - body rotation are characterized by two parameters : thermal - to - gravitational energy ratio @xmath6 and rotational - to - gravitational energy ratio @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution is divided into three types @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) a cloud with @xmath8 does not contract and oscillates . ( 2 ) a cloud with @xmath9 , which means the initial state is near the hydrostatic equilibrium from the virial theorem , experiences run - away collapse .",
    "the central density increases substantially in a finite timescale . in this case",
    ", the contracting cloud does not fragment .",
    "( 3 ) for a `` cold '' cloud such as @xmath10 , the cloud collapses in the direction of the angular momentum vector and forms a disk .",
    "the disk is subject to fragmentation as shown in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite although @xcite have reported that even the cloud with @xmath11 fragments in the isothermal regime if it has a sufficiently strong differential - rotation , such a `` warm '' cloud does not fragment unless a ring is formed in the isothermal phase .    since a ( nearly ) rotation - supported disk is formed in the adiabatic phase , the disk fragments if it is sufficiently thin .",
    "therefore , even if the gas does not fragment in the isothermal regime , it breaks into fragments after the adiabatic core has formed ( the first core ) .",
    "actually , @xcite , and @xcite assumed the barotropic equation of state for a gas and studied the evolution of a `` warm '' cloud with @xmath12 .",
    "they found that the thin disk fragments in the adiabatic phase even if @xmath6 is chosen for the cloud to experience the run - away collapse .",
    "@xcite showed that a cloud with @xmath13 fragments , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the initial central angular velocity and the free - fall time at the center @xmath16 , respectively . by comparing different initial rotation laws they found that the central angular velocity is essential to whether the cloud fragments or not .",
    "this shows us that the fragmentation conditions are directly related to @xmath17 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "the thickness of the disk is also important in the fragmentation process in the adiabatic stage @xcite . since the toomore s",
    "@xmath18 value of the disk is smaller than 1 and the gravitationally most unstable wave - length is much smaller than the disk radius , the disk which fragments is gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "disk structure is believed to be formed either by the rotation or the magnetic field .",
    "almost all previous studies focus on the hydrodynamical contraction process",
    ". however , the molecular cloud is magnetized , and magnetic field lines along the major axis of molecular clouds are often observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in star - forming regions ,",
    "the molecular outflows are seen to be ubiquitous ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that these outflows are driven by the magnetic force in his two - dimensional axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "@xcite pointed out that magnetic braking also plays an important role in a magnetically supported rotating cloud .",
    "consequently , the magnetic field should play an important role in the star - formation process .",
    "when the cloud has no rotation motion , the magnetic field must have a positive effect to form a thin disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in the rotating cloud , since the angular momentum can be removed from the core by magnetic force @xcite , the magnetic field may have a negative effect for fragmentation . to investigate the effect of the magnetic field on fragmentation or binary formation",
    ", three - dimensional calculation taking account of the magnetic field is needed",
    ".    however , there have been few studies of these calculations .",
    "it has not been cleared yet whether the magnetic field promotes fragmentation or suppresses it .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of magnetized molecular clouds and he claimed that the magnetic field promotes fragmentation .",
    "however , in his study , the angular momentum transfer by magnetic tension force is not included , because the magnetic field is accounted for by an approximate form .",
    "recently , @xcite studied fragmentation of a magnetized cloud using their mhd sph code .",
    "they found that fragmentation is prevented by the magnetic field because magnetic braking is so effective in their cloud .",
    "however , they calculated only 4 models with simple initial conditions .",
    "see also boss ( 2004 ) for a counterargument against @xcite .",
    "thus , it has not become clear whether the molecular clouds observed can actually fragment or not . in our study , having a large parameter range of initial rotation speed and magnetic field strength , it is found that fragmentation is suppressed by the magnetic field , as denoted in @xcite , although the magnetic braking is not so effective .",
    "ambipolar diffusion affects protostellar collapse especially at high density exceeding @xmath19 .",
    "however , the diffusion timescale has uncertainty depending on the ionization rate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a calculation of ambipolar diffusion requires large computational costs : hosking & whitworth ( 2004 ) calculate only a few models , and boss ( 2002 ) adopts a simple approximation in the treatment of the diffusion .",
    "we therefore adopt the ideal mhd in order to perform an extensive parameter survey .",
    "nakano ( 2002 ) shows that the magnetic field is coupled with gas in @xmath20 , indicating that the assumption of an ideal mhd is valid in the isothermal phase . in the adiabatic phase , the number density in the adiabatic core exceeds @xmath21 , and",
    "the magnetic field begins to decouple .",
    "our simulation may therefore overestimate the angular momentum transfer by magnetic field , especially in the dense fragments .",
    "we study the evolution and fragmentation of molecular clouds using full three - dimensional mhd simulations . in this study",
    ", we use a nested grid code , which always maintains sufficient spatial resolution in the central region . in this simulation ,",
    "structures in the range of 5 orders of magnitude in spatial extent ( e.g. @xmath22au @xmath23au ) are resolved , which corresponds to 14 orders of magnitude in the density contrast ( e.g. @xmath24 ) .",
    "we calculated 144 models with different magnetic field strengths , rotation speeds , and initial amplitudes of non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we have already reported a part of the result and a condition of fragmentation in machida , tomisaka & matsumoto ( 2004 ; hereafter mtm04 ) .",
    "mtm04 shows that fragmentation occurs if the first core has a large oblateness ( radius - height ratio ) .",
    "if the disk is thin enough ( oblateness @xmath25 ) , a non - axisymmetric mode develops in it after the gas becomes adiabatic . when a thick disk or a core is left at the core formation epoch ( oblateness @xmath26 ) , however , an axisymmetric core continues to contract .",
    "this seems to indicate single - star formation .",
    "if the non - axisymmetric perturbation has grown significantly and a bar appears in the isothermal stage , such a bar fragments in the following adiabatic accretion stage .",
    "subsequent to the companion paper ( machida 2004 ; hereafter paper i ) , we report results of three - dimensional mhd simulations in detail and give a condition for binary formation .",
    "paper i has studied the early evolution in which gas behaves isothermally .",
    "we have found that ( 1 ) a disk is formed in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and the rotation axis , and ( 2 ) the ratio of magnetic flux density to the square root of the gas pressure [ @xmath27 and that of the angular rotation speed to the gravitational free - fall rate [ @xmath28 , both of which are evaluated at the center of the cloud , are well correlated at the core - formation epoch as @xmath29 we evaluated the amplitude of the nonaxisymmetricity with the axis ratio viewed from the top at the end of the isothermal phase .",
    "this controls the subsequent evolution .",
    "we calculated cloud evolution in the density range from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in this paper , we present the evolution of the adiabatic accretion stage ( @xmath32 ) , while that of the isothermal collapse stage ( @xmath33 ) was shown in paper i. model and numerical method",
    "are given in  2 , and the results of our calculation are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the fragmentation conditions and the angular momentum redistribution between orbital and spin angular momenta after the fragmentation .",
    "the initial model and numerical method are the same as those of mtm04 and paper i. here we describe them briefly .",
    "we assume that gas obeys the ideal mhd equations ( eqs.[i.1][i.4 ] ) for simplicity , where equation [ i.1 ] represents equation ( 1 ) of paper i. interstellar gas behaves isothermally for @xmath34 and adiabatically with the specific heat ratio of @xmath35 for @xmath36@xcite .",

    "the initial model is characterized by three nondimensional parameters : the magnetic - to - thermal pressure ratio , @xmath45 the angular rotation velocity normalized by the free - fall timescale , @xmath46 and the initial amplitude of the non - axisymmetric perturbation , @xmath47 .",
    "the former two specify the equilibrium model , while the latter does the perturbations .",
    "we made 144 models by combining the above parameters and calculated them with the 3d nested grid code , as we did in mtm04 and paper i. we assume that the cloud has a central density of @xmath48 initially , except for some models in which the cloud has a central density of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in the following sections , we mention the evolution of the clouds only with @xmath51 and discuss its dependency on the initial density in  4.1 .",
    "when the central density exceeds @xmath52 , the gas temperature begins to rise , which supports the gas and forms a static core ( the first core ) as denoted in @xcite . when the first core rotates or has a magnetic field , various substructures ( c.f .",
    "core , disk , ring , and bar ) appear .",
    "that is , after the gas becomes adiabatic , fragmentation may occur as shown in mtm04 ( see also @xcite for a hydrodynamical case ) . in this section , we discuss cloud evolution in the adiabatic accretion phase ( @xmath53 ) , devoting particular attention to the fragmentation patterns . as shown in mtm04 , the adiabatic core shows three characteristically different types of evolution . in the case with a strong magnetic field , magnetic braking works and the angular momentum",

    "@xcite assumes the cloud have 200 @xmath262 g ( @xmath263 ) magnetic field strength and @xmath264 initial density , and he adopt the angular rotation speed in the range of @xmath265 s@xmath84 @xmath131 @xmath266 s@xmath84 ( @xmath267 ) .",

    "these clouds are located to the right hand of the @xmath185-@xmath1 relation curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] . in our study , the clouds in this region can not fragment , because these clouds form compact and dense core in the adiabatic stage owing to magnetic braking . in his study , since magnetic braking is not taken into account , the specific angular momentum of infalling gas seems relatively high .",
    "thus , only the effect which promotes cloud fragmentation ( magnetic pressure and dilution of gravity by magnetic tension ) is included in his calculation .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that fragmentation occurs only in the cloud with fast rotation .    on the other hand , a magnetized ( 764@xmath262 g ; @xmath270 ) and",
    "non - magnetized ( 0@xmath262 g ; @xmath104 ) clouds with the same angular velocity ( @xmath271 ) and the same density ( @xmath272 ) are investigated in @xcite .",
    "note that they included both the ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking .",
    "we did not include the former while @xcite did the former in the approximation form but not the latter .",
    "the non - magnetized cloud fragments in @xcite , while the magnetized cloud does not . comparing their parameters with ours ,",
    "their magnetized cloud ( @xmath273 , @xmath274 ) is in the non - fragmentation region in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] , while their non - magnetized cloud ( @xmath275 ) is in the fragmentation region .",
    "therefore their result is consistent with our fragmentation conditions .",
    "we conclude that the magnetic field suppresses the cloud fragmentation .",
    "the opposite result obtained by @xcite is likely to be ascribed to missing magnetic braking .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the angular momentum is redistributed between the orbital and spin angular momenta in the typical bar and ring fragmentation models .",
    "after fragmentation , the angular momentum of the host cloud is divided into orbital and spin angular momenta of fragments . as shown in  [ sec : ringf ] and  [ sec : barf ] , the fragments seem to have large orbital but small spin momenta in ring fragmentation , while they have small orbital and large spin angular momenta in bar fragmentation .",

    "we identify a fragment as a gas which has a density of @xmath286 in equations  ( [ eq : tot ] ) , ( [ eq : spn ] ) , and ( [ eq : mass ] ) .",
    "although we have compared how the values depend on the choice of this density , @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath289 give essentially the same result .",
    "[ fig : ang ] shows the three specific angular momenta ( total , orbital and spin ) of the fragments plotted against the time after fragmentation ( @xmath290 ) .",
    "three ring - fragmentation models ( upper panels ) and three bar - fragmentation models ( lower panels ) are plotted in this figure .",
    "magnetic field strengths increase from the left to the right as @xmath62=0.01 [ left panels : ( a ) and ( d ) ] , 0.1 [ middle panels : ( b ) and ( e ) ] and 1.0 [ right panels : ( c ) and ( f ) ] . the distances between the fragments are also plotted in each panel .",

    "the orbital angular momentum is about 20 times larger than the spin angular momentum .",
    "fragment mass grows up to @xmath293 in 1400 yr . at the same time , although the spin angular momentum increases up to @xmath294 , it is still 10 times smaller than the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the distance between the fragments has increased from 55 au ( @xmath295 yr ) to 160 au ( @xmath296 yr ) , because of the large angular momentum of the inflow gas . a similar increase in the spin angular momentum",
    "is observed in panels ( b ) and ( c ) . it should be noted , in any case of ring fragmentation",
    ", the system has a large orbital angular momentum and a small spin momentum .",
    "the ratio of spin to the orbital angular momenta is about 0.1 , and this ratio seems to somewhat depend on the magnetic field strength .",
    "we can see from these panels that the total angular momentum is mainly composed of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "tightly twisted magnetic field lines surround the ring .",
    "the magnetic field lines anchored to the fragments are weakly twisted as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring3 ] . in panels ( b ) and",
    "( c ) , the distances between the fragments decrease or oscillate , while they begin to increase in a further calculation ( @xmath297yr ) .",
    "for all the ring fragmentation models including those in panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , fragments survive without merging .",
    "the distance between fragments decreases in panel ( b ) and ( c ) , while it continues to increase or keep constant without decreasing in further calculations .",
    "therefore , these models seem suitable to form a binary system .      the lower panels of fig .  [ fig : ang ] indicate the angular momentum redistribution in the bar fragmentation models .",
    "the inset contour plots in panels ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) show that the fragmentation occurs in the bar in these models . in panel ( d )",
    "which is the case of a weakly magnetized cloud , the fragment has @xmath298 of the spin angular momentum , while it has @xmath292 of the orbital one at 200 yrs after the fragmentation . in this model ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum is larger than the spin momentum , similar to the ring fragmentation models .",
    "however , the ratio of orbital to spin angular momenta is not too large compared with that of the ring fragmentation . after the fragment mass grows to about @xmath299 ( @xmath300 yrs ) , the orbital angular momentum oscillates while the spin momentum continues to increase . at the same time , the distance between the fragments decreases gradually . in this model ,",
    "two fragments merge at about @xmath301 yrs after the fragmentation epoch . in the models shown in panel ( e )",
    ", the spin angular momentum continues to increase and catches up with the orbital one at 1260 yrs , and then orbital angular momentum begins to decrease rapidly , while the spin momentum decreases gradually . in a model with strong magnetic field [ panel ( f ) ] , the spin angular momentum also catches up with the orbital one at 540 yrs , and then , both momenta increase . for models shown in panels",
    "( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , the spin angular momentum exceeds or is equal to the orbital one , when the fragment mass becomes sufficiently larger compared with that of the fragmentation epoch . owing to the decrease of the orbital angular momentum , the radial distance between the fragments decreases .",
    "although the fragments do not merge in the models shown in ( e ) and ( f ) in our calculation , the radial distance decreases steadily .",
    "thus , the fragments seem to merge , if we continue the calculation further .",
    "bar fragmentation models have the common feature of the angular momentum being equivalently redistributed into the orbital and spin angular momentum .",
    "although the bar fragmentation occurs in 23 models in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] , the mutual mergers between two fragments occur in 9 models .",
    "however , this number must increase for a longer simulation . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong outflows are seen near the fragments in the bar fragmentation models as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar3 ] , because of their large spin angular momenta .    in conclusion ,",
    "we show that the angular momentum redistribution depends strongly on the fragmentation type , ring and bar , although it depends weakly on the magnetic field strength compared with panel ( a)-(c ) or ( d)-(f ) .      in this section",
    ", we apply our fragmentation conditions to several typical molecular clouds in which physical parameters are relatively well fixed .",
    "we find that the fragmentation region in fig .",

    "for example , if the molecular cloud l1253 with angular velocity of @xmath311s@xmath84 has a magnetic field weaker than @xmath3123.1 @xmath262 g , the cloud fragments . on the other hand ,",
    "if the molecular cloud l134 with magnetic flux density of @xmath313 g has a rotation speed faster than @xmath314  s@xmath84 , the cloud fragments in the adiabatic accretion phase and has a possibility of forming a binary system .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the effects of the ambipolar diffusion , which is not taken into account in this study .",
    "as discussed in paper i , the ambipolar diffusion has no appreciable effects as far as the isothermal collapse phase is concerned .",
    "however , the ambipolar diffusion plays an important role for high - density gases of @xmath315 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and the references therin ) .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion may change the outflows and fragmentation seen in our models seriously .",
    "first we examine the effects on the two types of outflows , i.e. , outer and inner outflows , shown in  3.2 and 3.3 .",
    "the outer outflow emerges from the ring or bar structure , while the inner one does from the dense adiabatic core .",
    "the effect should not be serious for the outer outflow , since the density does not reach @xmath316 even at the base of the outflow .",
    "on the other hand , the inner outflow should weaken substantially since the magnetic field is coupled only weakly with the gas at the base .",
    "thus the outer outflow will dominate if we include the ambipolar diffusion .",
    "next we consider how the ambipolar diffusion effects the fragmentation .",
    "if the adiabatic core has an appreciable amount of angular momentum , it will fragment as shown in  4.1 and @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the adiabatic core will not fragment either if the core looses its angular momentum through the outflow and the magnetic braking , or if it has a small angular momentum at the moment of formation .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion reduces the efficiency of the outflow and magnetic braking .",
    "thus it renders to promotion of fragmentation .    if the effect of ambipolar diffusion is restricted to the reduction in the angular momentum transfer , our conclusion that a cloud of a large @xmath317 fragments , is secure .",
    "this is because the angular momentum transfer is already less efficient in our models showing fragmentation .",
    "the reduction in the angular momentum transfer will not change the result . on the other hand ,",
    "the adiabatic core has only a small amount of the angular momentum at the moment of formation in the models showing no fragmentation .",
    "if the angular momentum is small , the fragments will not survive but merge even if once they are formed .",

    "<S> this is realized in a fast rotating adiabatic core as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the angular rotation speed and the free - fall time of the core , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) on the other hand , the disk is deformed to an elongated bar in the isothermal stage for a strongly magnetized or rapidly rotating cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the bar breaks into 2 - 4 fragments ( bar fragmentation ) . </S>",
    "<S> even if a disk is thin , the disk dominated by the magnetic force or thermal pressure is stable and forms a single compact body . in either ring or bar fragmentation mode , </S>",
    "<S> the fragments contract and a pair of outflows are ejected from the vicinities of the compact cores . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital angular momentum is larger than the spin angular momentum in the ring fragmentation . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , fragments often quickly merge in the bar fragmentation , since the orbital angular momentum is smaller than the spin angular momentum in this case . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with observations is also shown .    </S>",
    "<S> binaries : general  ism : jets and outflows  ism : magnetic fields mhd stars : formation . </S>"
