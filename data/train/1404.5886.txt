    "log - concave distributions and various properties related to log - concavity play an increasingly important role in probability , statistics , optimization theory , econometrics and other areas of applied mathematics . in view of these developments ,",
    "the basic properties and facts concerning log - concavity deserve to be more widely known in both the probability and statistics communities .",
    "our goal in this survey is to review and summarize the basic preservation properties which make the classes of log - concave densities , measures , and functions so important and useful .",
    "in particular we review preservation of log - concavity and `` strong log - concavity '' ( to be defined carefully in section  [ sec : basicdefinitions ] ) under marginalization , convolution , formation of products , and limits in distribution .",
    "the corresponding notions for discrete distributions ( log - concavity and ultra log - concavity ) are also reviewed in section  [ sec : discretelogconc ] .",
    "a second goal is to acquaint our readers with a useful monotonicity theorem for log - concave distributions on @xmath1 due to @xcite , and to briefly discuss connections with recent progress concerning `` asymmetric '' brascamp - lieb inequalities .",
    "efron s theorem is reviewed in section  [ subsec : efronmonothm ] , and further applications are given in the rest of section  [ sec : efronstheoremonedimension ] .",
    "there have been several reviews of developments connected to log - concavity in the mathematics literature , most notably @xcite and mr1898210 .",
    "we are not aware of any comprehensive review of log - concavity in the statistics literature , although there have been some review type papers in econometrics , in particular @xcite and @xcite . given the pace of recent advances , it seems that a review from a statistical perspective is warranted .",
    "several books deal with various aspects of log - concavity : the classic books by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and @xcite both cover aspects of log - concavity theory , but from the perspective of majorization in the first case , and a perspective dominated by unimodality in the second case .",
    "neither treats the important notion of strong log - concavity .",
    "the recent book by @xcite perhaps comes closest to our current perspective with interesting previously unpublished material from the papers of brascamp and lieb in the 1970 s and a proof of the brascamp and lieb result to the effect that strong log - concavity is preserved by marginalization .",
    "unfortunately simon does not connect with recent terminology and other developments in this regard and focuses on convexity theory more broadly .",
    "@xcite ( chapter 6 ) gives a nice treatment of the brunn - minkowski inequality and related results for log - concave distributions and densities with interesting connections to optimal transportation theory .",
    "his chapter 9 also gives a nice treatment of the connections between log - sobolev inequalities and strong log - concavity , albeit with somewhat different terminology .",
    "mr1849347 is , of course , a prime source for material on log - sobolev inequalities and strong log concavity .",
    "the nice book on stochastic programming by mr1375234 has its chapter 4 devoted to log - concavity and @xmath2concavity , but has no treatment of strong log - concavity or inequalities related to log - concavity and strong log - concavity . in this review",
    "we will give proofs some key results in the body of the review , while proofs of supporting results are postponed to section  [ sec : proofs ] ( appendix b ) .",

    "we will re - visit the notion of ultra log - concavity in section  [ sec : discretelogconc ] .",
    "our choice of terminology is motivated in part by the following definition from convexity theory : following @xcite , page 565 , we say that a proper convex function @xmath68 is _ strongly convex _ if there exists a positive number @xmath69 such that @xmath70 for all @xmath71and @xmath58 .",
    "it is easily seen that this is equivalent to convexity of @xmath72 ( see @xcite , exercise12.59 , page 565 ) .",
    "thus our first definition of strong log - concavity of a density function @xmath4 on @xmath3 is as follows :    [ stronglogconcavedefn1 ] for any @xmath73 define the class of strongly log - concave densities with variance parameter @xmath74 , or @xmath75 to be the collection of density functions @xmath4 of the form @xmath76for some log - concave function @xmath77 where , for a positive definite matrix @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 denotes the @xmath81 density given by @xmath82    if a random vector @xmath83 has a density @xmath4 of this form , then we also say that @xmath83 is strongly log - concave .",

    "notice however that if @xmath88 then larger values of @xmath89 corresp to smaller values of @xmath90 , and hence @xmath4 becomes _ less _ strongly log - concave as @xmath89 increases .",
    "thus in our definition of strong log - concavity the coefficient @xmath89 measures the `` flatness '' of the convex potential    it will be useful to relax this definition in two directions : by allowing the gaussian distribution to have a non - singular covariance matrix @xmath24 other than the identity matrix and perhaps a non - zero mean vector @xmath91 . thus our second definition is as follows .",
