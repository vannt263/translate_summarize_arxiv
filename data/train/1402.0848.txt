    "magnetars are neutron stars powered by their strong internal magnetic fields @xcite . the detailed study of the temporal behaviour of magnetar s emission can be used to constrain both their external dipolar magnetic field and internal structure @xcite . despite the fact that all neutron stars suffer a long term spin - down , due to their dipole magnetic field decay , many sudden spin - up , known as glitches in the literature , have been observed in pulsars and magnetars @xcite .",
    "recently , clear evidence of the first sudden spin - down detection was observed in magnetar 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite , a so - called `` anti - glitch '' .",
    "there , the authors propose two different interpretations for the observational evidence : ( i ) an anti - glitch event followed by a normal glitch ( after @xmath0100 days ) and ( ii ) a sequence of two anti - glitches ( separated by @xmath050 days ) .",
    "spin - down events were also observed in magnetars sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite and 4u 0142 + 61 @xcite , and in the high magnetic field pulsar psr j18460258 @xcite , but none of them is considered as an anti - glitch , because of their long timescales ( @xmath1  days ) .",
    "the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e 2259 + 586 , with a @xmath2  s period , is a magnetar with a characteristic age @xmath3  yr and a spin - inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath4  g , which poses a minimum value for the internal magnetic field strength .",
    "1e 2259 + 586 has been monitored with _",
    "rossi x - ray timing explorer _ and _ swift x - ray telescope _ over almost the last two decades , showing a stable spin - down rate , with the exception of two spin - up glitches in 2002 @xcite and 2007 @xcite , a timing event in 2009 @xcite , and this anti - glitch in 2012 .    from @xcite , it follows that the observational fact that has to be explained by any model is a total change in frequency in the complete @xmath5 day event was @xmath6  hz , that can be interpreted as two instantaneous changes in spin frequency @xmath7 . in order to adjust the timing data from _ swift _ , the authors propose two models : ( i ) an anti - glitch in which @xmath8 followed by a spin - up event , of amplitude @xmath9 ; ( ii ) an anti - glitch in which @xmath10 followed by a second anti - glitch in which @xmath11 . based on a bayesian analysis , model ( ii )",
    "is favoured @xcite .",
    "several explanations for this anti - glitch event have been proposed , based both on external @xcite and internal @xcite origins . despite searches in radio and x - ray wavelengths , no surrounding afterglow was detected @xcite , arguing against a sudden particle outflow or wind - driven scenario . in this sense , a most promising approach seems to be a an internal rearrangement of the star . with this short communication",
    "we aim to provide a simple mechanism where the sudden spin - down of the star occurs while the stellar structure reaccommodates after a substantial decay of the internal toroidal magnetic field component .",
    "a similar scenario was also suggested to account for the sgr 1900 + 14 event @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors developed a formalism to model magnetically deformed neutron stars . in their work",
    ", deformations are calculated for a uniform density star with a mixed poloidal - toroidal magnetic field configuration , rotating with angular velocity , which , in the case of magnetars , as 1e 2259 + 586 , is completely irrelevant , because of their long periods .",
    "the main result of their work is that while for strong poloidal magnetic fields , as for rapid rotation , the stars tend to oblate to keep mechanically stable , if internal toroidal fields dominate the magnetic field configuration , prolate stars are favoured .    for volume preserving @xmath12 mode , and mixed toroidal - poloidal magnetic field ,",
    "the quadrupolar distortion for incompressible stars of uniform density is given by :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mean value of the square of the toroidal magnetic field strength , @xmath15 is the mean value of the poloidal component , @xmath16 the radius of the undeformed star , @xmath17 the gravitational constant and @xmath18 the mass of the neutron star .    despite",
    "that a purely toroidal magnetic field is unstable @xcite , an additional poloidal component with energy @xmath19 stabilizes the magnetic field configuration @xcite , allowing us to neglect the poloidal contribution to eq .",
    "[ epsilon ] as @xmath20 .",
    "without entering in detailed calculations , based on eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) it is clear that the net effect of the decay of the toroidal magnetic field , which is expected due to the combination of ohmic and hall effects in the neutron star interior , as it is shown in numerical simulations ( see , fon instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is to make an initially stable prolate configuration unstable .",
    "the `` more spherical '' configuration has greater moment of inertia respect to the rotation axis , @xmath21 in this case , and thus , in the abscense of an external torque , due to the conservation of the angular momentum , this could easily account for the sudden spin - down observed .",
    "the theoretical picture that we want to explode is the following : given a certain `` initial '' mostly toroidal magnetic field strength , @xmath22 , the neutron star crust crystallizes in a prolate equilibrium configuration .",
    "then , as the magnetic field decays this prolate configuration becomes unstable up to a point in which a sudden change in the shape of the star occurs .",
    "after this , the stellar structure achieves a new stable and less prolate configuration associated to @xmath23 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ epsilon ] , a change in the effective toroidal magnetic field component will produce a change in the moments of inertia that would lead to a change in the rotation frequency of the star . if the magnetic field axis is aligned with the rotation axis of the star , the relative change in frequency will be given by :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the equatorial radius of the star .",
    "actually , we can analytically calculate @xmath25 as a function of @xmath14 using eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , from where we obtain :    @xmath26    thus , putting all together we can write ( eq . [ deltanu - o - nu ] ) as as a function of the quadrupolar distortion , resulting :    @xmath27    where , in the last approximation , we used that , in the case of our interest , both @xmath28 .",
    "following the model presented in section ii , for a constant density neutron star , which is deformed to a prolate shape by the presence a mostly toroidal magnetic field @xcite , we calculate the change in the magnetic field strength needed to account for the @xmath29 observed in 1e 2259 + 586 .    for a `` typical '' neutron star of radius @xmath30 and mass @xmath31 , with a mean toroidal magnetic field of @xmath32  g , which corresponds to a maximum value @xmath33  g @xcite",
    ", we estimate that a decay in the magnetic field of about @xmath34 can be responsible for the observed spin - down .",
    "these qualitative result is almost insensitive to other acceptable values for mass , radius and magnetic field strength ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    in figure ( [ fig1 ] )",
    "we plot the physical solutions , @xmath35 , to eq .",
    "( [ plot ] ) , as a function of the initial toroidal magnetic field strength @xmath22 , for three different neutron star configurations , assuming a jump in frequency @xmath36 equal to the first of the two events of model ( ii ) . in black",
    "we plot the identity as a reference .    ) for @xmath37 as function of @xmath22 , for three different neutron star configurations . in solid black",
    "we plot the identity function as a reference.,width=10 ]    for each of the adopted neutron star configurations , we find that a minimum value for @xmath22 is needed in order to have a solution to eq .",
    "( [ plot ] ) for the observed @xmath29 .",
    "this critical value is , in any case , several times @xmath38  g , which avoids the occurrence of anti - glitches in normal pulsars , only allowing this phenomena to occur in strongly magnetized neutron stars , i.e. magnetars .",
    "this result explains why despite that many pulsars have been thoroughly monitored for several decades , no sudden spin - down event of this kind has been detected at all .    in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) we present @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( [ plot ] ) as a function of the change @xmath39 in the toroidal magnetic flied strength .",

    "a very simple model to explain the anti - glitch observed in magnetar 1e 2259 + 586 is presented here .",
    "we propose that a natural decay of the toroidal magnetic field component , of approximately @xmath34 , from an initial @xmath40  g , would be enough to de - stabilize an originally prolate configuration for the stellar structure , reducing it to a `` more spherical '' one . as a result , a sudden change in the moments of inertia of the star produces a net spin - down , as the one observed in @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the magnetic field evolution in neutron stars show that a magnetic field decay of @xmath34 as the one needed in our model is easily achieved after @xmath41  yr for a magnetar like 1e 2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to notice that gravitational waves potentially observed by advanced ligo , should be emitted under this scenario due to oscillations induced by the changes in the stellar structure .",
