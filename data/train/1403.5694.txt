    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics is very successful in explaining physics around the electroweak scale .",
    "however , despite this several questions remain to be answered such as neutrino masses and mixing @xcite , the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) @xcite , and the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "none of these issues is successfully explained within the sm .",
    "therefore , various extensions beyond the sm have been proposed to address these problems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , krauss , trodden , and one of the authors in this paper , proposed an extension of the sm with two charged @xmath5 singlet scalars and one right handed ( rh ) neutrino field @xmath6 , where a @xmath7 symmetry was imposed at the lagrangian level in order to forbid the dirac neutrino mass terms . after the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , neutrino masses are generated at three - loop , which makes their masses naturally small due to the high loop suppression .",
    "moreover , the field @xmath6 is odd under @xmath7 symmetry , and thus it is guaranteed to be stable , which makes it a good candidate for dm . ref .",
    "@xcite studied the phenomenological implication of this model with two rh neutrinos , instead of just one . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in order to fit the neutrino oscillation data and be consistent with different recent experimental constraints such as lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) , one needs to have three rh neutrinos .",
    "somewhat similar classes of three - loop neutrino mass models have also been studied in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the feasibility of testing this radiative model at the next - generation electron - positron colliders @xcite . the international linear collider ( ilc ) , being designed for operation at several @xmath1 collision energies , will be a great opportunity to anticipate detailed physics studies of our model . among the different processes which can be studied at the ilc , we will focus here on the process @xmath8 within the allowed kinematic regions of the machine .",
    "further dedicated studies that probe different final states are in preparation for future works @xcite .",
    "accordingly , our signal will consist of electron , anti - muon and missing energy . in the sm , the missing energy is coming just from one source @xmath9 , whereas in our model , there are twelve different processes that give rise to @xmath10 in the final state : six with sm left handed ( lh ) neutrinos and six contributions with heavy rh majorana neutrinos .",
    "moreover , the background process in our model gets modified through extra additional channels .",
    "thus , we look for the excess in the number of events from the process @xmath11 in this model over the contribution from the sm and then identify whether the missing energy is produced from lh or rh neutrinos .",
    "similar effects have been investigated in other class of models @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we introduce the three - loop radiative model for neutrino masses , then we discuss its detectability at linear collider in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we present and discuss the simulation results .",
    "we give our conclusion in section v.",
    "the model that we will study is an extension of the sm with three rh neutrinos , @xmath12 , and two electrically charged scalars , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , that are singlet under the @xmath5 gauge group in addition to a discrete @xmath7 symmetry , under which @xmath15 and all other fields are even .",

    "[ diag ] , which fits the neutrino oscillation data and without being in conflict with several experiential constraints such as the bounds on lepton flavor violating processes , the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the neutrino - less double beta decay .",
    "@xmath26 has a dm candidate ( @xmath6 ) with a relic density in agreement with the observation for masses around the electroweak scale .",
    "@xmath26 gives rise to a strong first order phase transition that is required for a successful baryogenesis without being in conflict with the recent higgs mass measurements provided by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations .",
    "@xmath26 possible enhancement in the higgs decay channel @xmath27 , while the channel @xmath28 gets a small suppression within 5% according to the sm .    @xmath26 significant large enhancement on the triple higgs coupling due to the extra contributions .",
    "neutrinos , which manifest inside the detector as missing energy , are produced due to the new lepton flavor violating interactions given by the @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms in ( [ l ] ) . at an @xmath1 linear collider such as the ilc , they can be directly pair produced in association with a single ( or multiple ) photon(s ) , or a pair of charged leptons ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , the production rate of @xmath32 is expected to be small at the lhc . ] .",
    "in addition , both light ( @xmath33 ) and heavy ( @xmath12 ) neutrinos can be generally produced at linear colliders according to their production cross section .",
    "however , by using polarized beams , one can reduce / increase the production rate of one type of chiral particles as compared to the other ones . for instance",
    ", if one uses lh polarized electron beam , the heavy rh majorana neutrinos production rate gets suppressed and vice - versa .",

    ", the only kinematically allowed decay modes of @xmath36 are three - body decays and therefore their total decay widths are small .",

    "detailed studies about the production mechanisms and the decay modes in @xmath37 collisions , of new heavy fermions and neutrinos has been performed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of various signals and backgrounds of new heavy fermions predicted by the sm extensions can be found in @xcite .    in our model",

    "then , the number of signal events is the difference between the contributions from the 12 subprocesses mentioned above and the sm background .",
    "hence , our goal will be to study the feasibility of detecting any possible excess of events in our model compared to the sm predictions at the ilc @xcite for different beam energies .",
    "our analysis also applies to the other future leptonic linear colliders , such as compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite ; and the triple - large electron - positron collider ( tlep ) @xcite .    for small beam energies ( such as 250 or 350 )",
    ", the rh neutrinos can not be produced due to the kinematical constraints ; and when there are any observed events from the defined signal , it is due to the light lh neutrinos .",
