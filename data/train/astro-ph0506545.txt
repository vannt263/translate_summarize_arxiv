    "currently , a consistent scenario for the evolution of the x - ray emission properties of aging rotation - powered pulsars does not exist yet .",
    "this surprising fact is largely due to the lack of sufficient observational data .",
    "young yrs , @xmath14 yrs and @xmath15 yrs , respectively .",
    "this classification is diffuse , though , with a smooth transition in between the different groups . ] and middle aged neutron stars , which emit strong pulsed non - thermal and/or surface hot - spot plus cooling emission , were studied reasonably well in the x - ray band . in contrast , until recently , most old radio pulsars were too faint for a detailed examination of their x - ray emission ( cf .",
    "sun et al .",
    "1993 ; manning & willmore 1994 ; becker & trmper 1997 ; saito 1998 ) .",
    "however , especially old rotation - powered non - recycled pulsars are of particular interest for the study of particle acceleration and high energy radiation processes near the neutron star s surface and in its magnetosphere .",
    "this is because their ages are intermediate between those of the well - studied young and cooling neutron stars , whose surface may produce copious thermal x - ray photons , and those of very old recycled millisecond pulsars , in which thermal hot - spot and non - thermal magnetospheric x - ray production mechanisms are believed to dominate .",
    "old , non - recycled pulsars ( outside globular clusters ) therefore aid in answering questions such as how do the emission properties of the younger pulsars , like geminga , psr b0656 + 14 and psr b1055 - 52 , change as they age from @xmath16 to @xmath17 years ?",
    "will the thermal emission simply fade away due to cooling with increasing age or will the star be kept hot ( at about @xmath18 k ) over millions of years due to energy dissipation by processes such as internal frictional heating ( @xmath19 erg / s ) and crust cracking , as proposed by vortex creeping and pinning models ?",
    "what happens to the non - thermal , hard - tail emission seen in the x - ray spectra of the middle - aged field pulsars ?",
    "( see e.g.  saito 1988 ; becker & aschenbach 2002 ; de luca et al .  2005 ) .",
    "will this emission become the dominant source or will this component also decay with time and will only thermal emission from the hot and heated polar - caps remain ?    in order to address these questions , we initiated a program to study the x - ray emission properties of old rotation - powered pulsars with xmm - newton , aiming to probe and identify the origin of their x - ray radiation .",
    "first results from parts of this project have been presented recently , reporting on the pulsars b0950 + 08 , b0823 + 26 , j2043 + 2740 ( becker et al .",
    "2004 ; zavlin & pavlov 2004 ) and psr b0628 - 28 ( becker et al .  2005 ) all of which have a spin - down age in the range from about one million to seventeen million years .",
    "if one extrapolates the x - ray emission properties of young and cooling neutron stars to this age bracket , one may expect that the cooling emission fades away and thermal emission from heated polar caps dominates the x - rays .",
    "surprisingly , the x - ray emission from old pulsars is largely dominated by non - thermal radiation processes .",
    "none of the pulsars x - ray spectra required the addition of a thermal component , consisting of hot polar cap emission , to model their energy spectra .",
    "further support for an emission scenario dominated by non - thermal mechanisms is given by the observed temporal emission properties .",
    "the pulse profiles of psrs b0950 + 08 and b0628 - 28 are not broad and sinusoidal as would have been expected for spin - modulated thermal x - ray emission from heated polar caps , but are double peaked with narrow pulse components and pulsed fractions in the range of @xmath20",
    ".    some models , such as those by harding & muslimov ( 2001 ; 2002 ; 2003 ) , predicted in the framework of their revised space - charge - limited flow model that polar cap heating , as a fraction of the spin - down luminosity , increases with pulsar age and should be most efficient for pulsars of spin - down age @xmath21@xmath22 yrs , if they are in fact producing pairs from curvature radiation photons .",
    "however , according to the harding & muslimov model , b0950 + 08 and b0823 + 26 can not produce pairs from curvature radiation of primary electrons since they both lie below the curvature radiation pair death line in the @xmath23-@xmath24 diagram of radio pulsars ( cf .",
    "becker et al .",
    "2004 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "a good candidate object to test these models is psr b1929@xmath010 which according to its x - ray emission properties can be considered to be prototypical of an old pulsar . with a pulse period of @xmath25  ms and a period derivative of @xmath26",
    ", its characteristic age is determined to be @xmath27 years .",
    "these spin parameters imply a spin - down luminosity of @xmath28 and a magnetic field at the neutron star magnetic poles of @xmath29  g. with a radio dispersion measure of @xmath30 , the ne2001 galactic free electron density model of cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) predicts a distance of 170 pc .",
    "however , the recent astrometric measurements by chatterjee et al .  ( 2004 ) yielded a precise proper motion and parallax determination that translates into an accurate distance measurement of @xmath31 pc and a transverse speed of @xmath32 km s@xmath33 .",
    "thus , psr b1929@xmath010  is among the closest pulsars known .",
    "in addition to its relatively young age it appears to be the brightest among all old non - recycled x - ray detected rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "its x - ray emission was discovered with the einstein observatory by helfand ( 1983 ) .",
    "pulsed x - ray emission was discovered using a deep rosat observation ( yancopoulos et al .",
    "the pulse profile was found to be very broad with a single pulse stretching across the entire phase cycle , markedly different from the sharp peak observed in the radio band .",
    "the fraction of pulsed photons in the @xmath34 kev band was determined to be @xmath35 .",
    "the rosat data were not able to constrain the nature of the pulsar emission as a blackbody spectrum ( representing thermal polar - cap emission ) and a power law model ( representing non - thermal magnetospheric emission ) fitted the data equally well ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .",
    "similar results were obtained in the analysis of asca spectral / timing data by wang and halpern ( 1997 ) and saito ( 1998 ) .",
    "the broad sinusoidal pulse profile together with the higher column absorption of @xmath36 deduced from power law fits were taken as indirect arguments and strong indicator for a thermal polar - cap origin of the x - rays which was believed to be in better agreement with the close pulsar distance of @xmath37 pc as believed at that time . ] .",
    "in contrast , slowikowska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently found that a single blackbody spectral model can not describe the pulsar spectrum if the rosat and asca observed spectra are modeled in a joint analysis . in their work",
    "it is shown that a single power law model or a composite model consisting of a two component blackbody spectrum can successfully describe the energy spectrum up to @xmath38 kev . the higher column density fitted by these models",
    "is found to be in agreement with that observed for other sources located near to the pulsar s line of sight and at comparable distances ( slowikowska et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "regardless of the nature of its x - ray emission , psr b1929@xmath010 seems to be special for its extended x - ray emission which was discovered by wang , li & begelman ( 1993 ) in their archival study of the galactic soft x - ray background using deep rosat pspc images .",
    "they found that the orientation of the diffuse x - ray emission is almost aligned with the pulsar s proper motion direction , suggesting an interpretation in terms of an x - ray emitting trail behind the pulsar .",
    "if indeed associated with the pulsar , the trail could account for @xmath39 of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity although the effective brightness may depend strongly on the density of the ambient interstellar matter .",
    "in recent years , the lack of confirmation of the trail from a subsequent @xmath40 ksec deep rosat hri observation casts some doubt on its existence .",
    "near - uv emission from psr b1929@xmath010 has been detected in three partly overlapping spectral bands using the hubble space telescope s",
    "faint object camera ( pavlov et al .",
    "1996 ) and the nuv - mama detector ( mignani et al .",
    "the nature of the optical emission is uncertain since the paucity of color information makes any spectral fit based on the optical data only merely tentative .",
    "psr b1929@xmath010 has also been extensively observed at radio frequencies .",
    "the main peak of the radio profile , although much smaller than the x - ray pulse , has a substructure which can be modeled by six separate components ( kramer et al .",
    "low - level emission connects this main pulse with an interpulse about 180 deg in longitude apart ( see e.g.  everett & weisberg 2001 ) .",
    "the pulsar s viewing geometry has been studied by many authors via the observed polarization angle swing , applying a rotating vector model .",
    "everett & weisberg ( 2001 ) reviewed the various results and concluded that both , the main and interpulse , are produced by nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes and are emitted from nearly opposite sides of a wide , hollow cone .",
    "they derive an inclination of the magnetic axis with the spin axis of @xmath41 while the impact angle of the line of sight was determined to be @xmath42 ( cf .",

    "a dual - channel cryogenic receiver system sensitive to two orthogonal polarizations was used predominantly at frequencies close to 1400 mhz .",
    "the signals of each polarization were mixed to an intermediate frequency , fed through a multichannel filter - bank and digitized .",
    "the data were de - dispersed in hardware and folded on  line according to the pulsar s dispersion measure and topocentric period .",

    "intensity profile for the observation .",
    "toas were subsequently determined by convolving , in the time domain , the averaged profile with a template corresponding to the observing frequency .",
    "the uncertainty on the toa was found using the method , described by downs & reichley ( 1983 ) which incorporates the off  pulse rms noise and the ` sharpness ' of the template .",
    "these toas were transferred to an arrival time at the solar system barycenter using the jet propulsion laboratory de200 solar system ephemeris ( standish 1982 ) .",

    "the smallwindow mode was preferred over other epic - pn imaging modes because of its higher temporal resolution , albeit its @xmath35 higher dead - time caused a decrease in the net exposure by @xmath58 .",

    "xmm - newton data have been known to show timing discontinuities in the photon arrival times with positive and negative jumps of the order of one to several seconds ( becker & aschenbach 2002 ; kirsch et al .",
    "while an inspection of the data processing log - files reveals that none of the epic - pn data taken from psr b1929@xmath010 exhibit such discontinuities , we nevertheless used a release track version of the xmm - newton standard analysis software ( sas ) version 6.5 ( released in august 2005 ) to process the epic - pn data .",
    "this software detects and corrects most of the timing discontinuities during data processing .",
    "in addition , known timing offsets due to ground station and spacecraft clock propagation delays are corrected by this software in using newly reconstructed time correlation ( tcx ) data ( cf .",

    "barycenter correction of the epic - pn data and all other analysis steps were performed by using sas version 6.1 .",
    "data screening for times of high sky background was done by inspecting the light - curves of the epic - mos1/2 and pn data at energies above 10 kev .",
    "apart from having a rather high sky background contribution in both april observations , very strong x - ray emission from soft proton flares is covering about half of these april data sets .",
    "the data quality of the shorter november 2003 observation is not reduced by these effects .    using light - curves with 100 s bins , we rejected time intervals where the mos1/2 had more than 130 , 140 and 175 cts / bin in the 2003 november , 2004 april 27 and 29 observations , respectively .",

    "contour lines , obtained from a re - analysis of 45 ksec rosat pspc and 350 ksec rosat hri observations , are overlaid .",
    "owing to a sensitivity ratio between the pspc and hri of up to a factor of @xmath65 ( depending on the source spectrum ) and a much higher detector noise the faint trail like emission is much harder to detect in the hri data . only after applying an adaptive kernel smoothing procedure",
    "a source structure which matches with the shape of the trail seen in the pspc and mos1/2 images becomes visible in this data .",
    "an interesting difference , though , is that in the hri data the trail seems to break up into two separate pieces . in",

    "the angular resolution of the rosat detectors are 25 arcsec in the pspc and 5 arcsec in the hri , respectively , while that of xmm - newton is 15 arcsec ( half energy width ) .    inspecting the mos1/2 full field of view ( cf .",
    "figure [ psrb_mos_fullfield]a ) there is some indication for trail emission beyond the edge of the inner mos ccd . to reduce the impact on the trail detection due to the presence of other x - ray point sources in the field ( though no bright sources are located along the trail ) we have removed point source contributions from the mos1/2 data and corrected the image for telescope vignetting effects . the result is displayed in figure [ psrb_mos_fullfield]b . clearly , there is a whiff of emission which probably extends down to the edge of the detector s field of view , but its significance at locations more distant from the pulsar is gradually fading into the background . in order to estimate the significance of the emission along the tail we extracted four circles at increased distance from the pulsar , at 1.5 , 4.5 , 7.5 , and 10.5 , respectively .",

    "in the vicinity of the source we found a diffuse background of 25 mjy . the pulsar itself was evident with 25 mjy above the local background level .",
    "the radio tail was visible with fluxes of up to 15 mjy above local background and unresolved in the transverse direction .",
    "the tail was not aligned with the low level residual scanning effects .",
    "the distance to the bright node on the tail was found to be 8.8 , but more aligned features were visible further in the beam out to 12. in order to estimate the probability of a spurious detection we derived a probability of a pixel exceeding 34 mjy as @xmath72 from a histogram of all pixels in our map .",
    "we made another histogram from a 33 ( 78 pixel ) line along the tail direction from the pulsar , excluding the first 6 of the point source .",
    "18 of the remaining 64 pixels were found to be above 34 mj .",
    "the binominal distribution gives a probability of @xmath73 for a random occurrence of such a result along an arbitrary line of similar length in our map . using the resolution ( 4.3 ) for a conservative estimate of the tail width",
    ", we find that the probability of a random alignment in the direction of proper motion is about @xmath74 .",
    "hence the probability of a coincidence of weak random radio sources with the observed psr tail is about @xmath75    nevertheless , inspecting the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) which is a 1.4 ghz continuum survey mapping the entire sky north of -40 deg declination ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) we found faint not fully resolved radio sources which match in position with the brighter end of the radio tail seen at 11 cm ( 2.72 ghz ) .",
    "there is no radio emission seen bridging the pulsar and these faint sources , however , this absence is likely a function of the vla telescope configuration which affects the sensitivity of the observations to diffuse emission .",

    "as there are other bright sources in the 11 cm effelsberg data which are not seen in the nvss image ( e.g.  the bright circularly shaped source located in the north - east of figure [ effelsberg_nvss_map]a ) the nvss data can not help to constrain the nature of the elongated radio feature seen at 11 cm . a comparison of the effelsberg and nvss radio images with the rosat pspc and hri x - ray images is shown in figure [ psrb_radio_vs_rosat ] .",

    "can the generic features of these models also explain the emission properties we observe from psr b1929@xmath010 ?",
    "it is commonly believed that the non - thermal x - ray photons are emitted by relativistic charged particles in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "these relativistic particles could be accelerated in a polar cap region ( e.g.  harding 1981 ; zhang & harding 2000 ) or in the outer - magnetosphere ( e.g.  cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 ) .",
    "in order to calculate the non - thermal spectrum and the energy dependent light curves , the amount of current flow and detailed three dimensional geometry of the accelerator are required . to fix these parameters ,",
    "gamma - ray data is normally required . however ,",

    "however , this is very unlikely by its narrowness as strong gravitational light bending would smear out the thermal pulse from the surface ( e.g.  page 1995 ) .",
    "cheng , ruderman & zhang ( 2000 ) have shown that incoming current must exist from null charge surface to the stellar surface due to pair creation in the outer magnetosphere accelerator .    here",

    "the first large pulse is the result of the incoming current toward the south pole while another pulse is produced by the outgoing current from the north pole .",
    "the small pulse is produced by outgoing current near the light cylinder .",
    "we note that the phase separation of these three pulses roughly corresponds to the phase separation of the three pulse components observed in the x - ray light curve . here , the ( x , z ) plane is chosen to lie at the zero - phase position in figure [ sim_profile ] . on the other hand , in figure [ psrb_x_radio_profiles ] , the ( x , z ) plane should lie in the middle between the two radio pulses .",
    "therefore , the simulated x - ray light curves roughly reproduce the phase relative to the radio pulses within a phase error of about @xmath212 which is well within the observed uncertainties .",

    "the extended diffuse emission associated with this old pulsar ( with spin down energy less than @xmath213 ergs s@xmath33 ) indicates that spin down power is not the sole criterion for its detection .",
    "in addition to distance , the detectability may also be dependent on the pulsar s transverse velocity ( see chatterjee & cordes 2002 ) .",
    "the existence of a possible radio counterpart in the 11 cm effelsberg data is exciting and , if confirmed in subsequent observations , can provide important information on the trail properties . no diffuse emission from the pulsar trail is detected in @xmath214 perhaps suggesting that the neutral component of the interstellar medium is low ( see chatterjee & cordes 2002 ) in the environment surrounding psr b1929@xmath010 .",
    "since the trails x - ray emission near to the pulsar has a hard spectrum characterized by a power law photon index of @xmath215 , the emission is non - thermal and is likely to be produced from the synchrotron process of highly relativistic electrons in the shocked region between the pulsar wind and surrounding interstellar medium . a physical description of psr b1929@xmath010 s x - ray trail based on the rosat findings has been discussed by wang , li , & begelman ( 1993 ) in terms of an outflow collimated within the pulsar s cavity created by its motion .",
    "alternatively , the properties of the distorted wind nebula can be inferred under the assumption that the electron lifetime due to synchrotron losses , @xmath216 , is comparable to the timescale for the passage of the pulsar over the length of its x - ray trail .",
