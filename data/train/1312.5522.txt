    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nlsy1 ) galaxies , first suggested as a distinct class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by @xcite , are characterized in optical by their narrow permitted emission lines ( full - width at half maximum fwhm @xmath3 2000 km s@xmath4 ) , weak [ oiii]@xmath55007 emission line ( [ oiii]/h@xmath6 @xmath7 3 ) , and strong feii emission lines .",
    "they also exhibit strong x - ray variability , steep x - ray spectra , substantial soft x - ray excess and relatively high luminosity @xcite .",
    "these characteristics suggest that nlsy1s have smaller masses of the central black hole ( m@xmath8 = 10@xmath910@xmath10 m@xmath11 ) and higher @xmath12 values ( up to the eddington limit or above ) than those observed in blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "only a small percentage ( @xmath77% ) of nlsy1 are radio - loud @xcite compared to @xmath215% of the quasars . in the radio - loud nlsy1s , flat radio spectra and flux density variability suggest that several of them could host relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "pmn j0948@xmath10022 shows optical properties typical of a nlsy1 ( i.e.   fwhm(h@xmath6 ) = 1432@xmath1387 km s@xmath4 , [ oiii]/h@xmath6@xmath20.1 , a strong feii bump ) , and a radio loudness of @xmath14 = 355 @xcite .",
    "high brightness temperature and a compact structure have been observed for pmn j0948 + 0022 @xcite , in addition to a possible core - jet structure @xcite .",
    "this source was the first radio - loud nlsy1 to be detected in @xmath0 rays by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _",
    "after that , other 4 radio - loud nlsy1s were detected with high significance in @xmath0 rays @xcite , suggesting the radio - loud nlsy1s as a third class of @xmath0-ray emitting agn with relativistic jets .",
    "on the contrary , no radio - quiet seyfert galaxies have been detected in @xmath0 rays @xcite .",
    "three @xmath0-ray flares were observed from pmn j0948@xmath10022 during 20102013 , reaching daily peak fluxes of ( 1 - 2)@xmath1510@xmath16 photons @xmath17 s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this indicates that radio - loud nlsy1s also can host powerful relativistic jets such as blazars .",

    "after the discovery of @xmath0-ray emission from pmn j0948@xmath10022 , this source has been the target of different multifrequency campaigns with the aim of understanding its nature .",
    "the first spectral energy distributions ( seds ) collected for this object , as well as for the other three @xmath0-ray nlsy1s detected in the first year of _ fermi _ operation , showed clear similarities with blazars : a double - humped shape with a first peak in the ir / optical band due to synchrotron emission , a second peak in the mev / gev band likely due to inverse compton emission , and an accretion disk component in uv .",
    "the physical parameters of these nlsy1s are blazar - like , and jet powers are in the average range of blazars @xcite .",
    "in addition , the comparison of the sed of pmn j0948@xmath10022 during the 2010 july flaring activity with that of 3c 273 , a typical flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) , showed a more extreme compton dominance in the nlsy1 .",
    "the disagreement between the two seds can be due to the difference in black hole ( bh ) masses and doppler factor of the two jets @xcite .",
    "the radio - to-@xmath0-ray light curves of the source collected over years showed correlated variability , with a delay of a few months of the radio emission with respect to the @xmath0-ray , as usually observed in fsrqs @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the results of the analysis of the multiwavelength data of pmn j0948@xmath10022 collected during 2011 may ",

    "our reflection model differs substantially from that presented by @xcite .",
    "while we confirm that their model is a good fit to the spectrum , we note that it relies on a high inclination angle of @xmath65 , which is inconsistent with the blazar - like properties of the source , as well as the inclusion of a warm absorber , which is not required in any of the other models .",
    "furthermore , their model does not allow the power law , which illuminates the disc , to also contribute directly to the spectrum .",
    "a blackbody model also gives a comparable fit , but a temperature of kt = 0.18 kev is necessary .",

    "the small variability amplitude ( @xmath22 ) observed in x - rays with respect to the @xmath0 rays ( @xmath210 ) could be an indication that the x - ray emission is produced by the low - energy tail of the same electron distribution . on the other hand ,",

    "the presence of the soft x - ray excess below 2 kev could dilute the x - ray variability over the 0.310 kev energy range , but an amplitude variability of a factor of @xmath22 ( with fluxes between 2.14.1@xmath1510@xmath57 erg @xmath17 s@xmath4 ) was also observed considering only the 210 kev energy range . in this context no obvious relation exists between the soft x - ray excess and the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the excess observed below 2 kev is a signature of the bulk comptonisation process by a cold relativistic plasma accelerating along the jet and scattering on disc photons reprocessed by the broad - line region ( blr ) @xcite .",
    "a dedicated modeling of the source s sed including xmm-_newton _ and _ fermi_-lat data will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the discovery of a relativistic jet in a class of agn thought to be hosted in spiral galaxies such as the nlsy1s , as opposed to blazars and radio galaxies hosted in elliptical galaxies @xcite , was a great surprise challenging the current knowledge on how the jet structures are generated and developed ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately only very sparse observations of the host galaxies of radio - loud nlsy1s are available and the sample of objects studied by @xcite and @xcite have redshifts @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , while four out five of the nlsy1s detected in @xmath0 rays have @xmath69 . among the radio - loud nlsy1s detected up to now by lat only for the closest one , 1h 0323@xmath1342 , was the host galaxy clearly detected .",
    "observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ and nordic optical telescope revealed a one - armed galaxy morphology or a circumnuclear ring , respectively , suggesting two possibilities : the spiral arm of the host galaxy @xcite or the residual of a galaxy merger @xcite .",
    "these observations , together with the lack of information about the host galaxy of the other @xmath0-ray emitting nlsy1s , leaves room for the hypothesis that the nlsy1s detected in @xmath0 rays by lat could have peculiar host galaxies with respect to the other nlsy1s .",
    "therefore the possibility that the development of relativistic jets in these objects occurs in hosts undergoing strong merger activity , or with non - spiral morphology , can not be ruled out .",
    "further high - resolution observations of the host galaxies of pmn j0948@xmath10022 and the other @xmath0-ray nlsy1s will be fundamental to obtain insights into the onset of production of relativistic jets in these sources .      the mechanism for producing a relativistic jet",
    "is still unclear .",
    "in particular the physical parameters that drive the jet formation are still under debate .",
    "one of the key parameters should be the bh mass , with only large masses allowing an efficient jet formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore one of the most surprising facts related to the discovery of pmn j0948@xmath10022 was the development of a relativistic jet in an object with a relatively small bh mass , 3.2@xmath1510@xmath70 m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that a bh mass higher than 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 is necessary for producing a radio - loud agn and that the merger history together with the subsequent galaxy morphology plays a fundamental role . in any case , the estimated mass of this source , as well as for the other nlsy1s , has large uncertainties . by means of the broad band",
    "sed modeling a bh mass of 1.5@xmath1510@xmath10 m@xmath11 was estimated for pmn j0948@xmath10022 in @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that blr clouds are subjected to radiation pressure from the absorption of ionizing photons , and by applying a correction to the virial relation we have higher masses for the nlsy1s .",
    "recently , also @xcite pointed out that the bh masses of the nlsy1s estimated by the modelling of optical / uv data with a shakura & sunyaev disc spectrum could be significantly higher than those derived on the basis of single epoch virial methods .",
    "in particular , for pmn j0948@xmath10022 they found a value of 10@xmath71 m@xmath11 in agreement with the typical bh mass of blazars .",
    "this may solve the problem of the minimum bh mass predicted in different scenarios of relativistic jet formation and development , but introduces a possible new one .",
    "for spiral galaxies , the bh mass typically ranges between 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if the bh mass is on the larger side of the estimated values , how is it possible to reconcile such a large bh mass with a spiral galaxy ?    a second fundamental parameter for the efficiency of relativistic jet production should be the bh spin , with super - massive black holes ( smbh ) in elliptical galaxies having on average much larger spins than smbhs in disc - spiral galaxies , as proposed in the `` modified spin paradigm '' @xcite .",
    "this is because the spin evolution of bhs in spiral galaxies seems to be limited by multiple accretion events with random orientation of the angular momentum vectors and small increments of mass , while elliptical galaxies underwent at least one major merger with large matter accretion triggering an efficient spin - up of the smbhs .",
    "thus , the mass and the spin of the bh seem to be related to the host galaxies , leading to the hypothesis that relativistic jets can efficiently develop only in elliptical galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the presence of a rapidly spinning bh was inferred by means of x - ray reflection spectroscopy in a few radio - quiet agns hosted by spiral / disc galaxies , suggesting that the bh spin is not the only parameter that drives the radio - quiet / radio - loud dichotomy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we noted that bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1s reported in @xcite and @xcite are generally larger than those in the entire sample of nlsy1s ( m@xmath8 @xmath72(210)@xmath1510@xmath70 m@xmath73 ) , even if still smaller than those in radio - loud quasars .",
    "the larger bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1s could be related to higher mass accretion events that can spin up the bhs . in the same way the smaller fraction of radio - loud nlsy1s with respect to the radio - loud quasars could be because the high accretion rate regime does not last sufficiently long in all nlsy1s to substantially spin up the central bh @xcite .",
    "another consideration which is likely to be important for jet formation is the nature of the accretion flow . in particular ,",
    "a geometrically thick accretion flow is needed in order to create large - scale poloidal magnetic fields , which may play a dominant role in the launching of jets @xcite . in cases where standard thin discs are present",
    ", the jet activity may be due to the dissipation of coronal magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for pmn j0948@xmath10022 it is clear that emission from the jet dominates the x - ray spectrum above 2 kev , while we are likely seeing the accretion disc plus corona of the agn at lower x - ray energies .",
    "although we can not constrain detailed models for the soft x - ray emission with the current observations , we note that the spectral slope is similar to that found in radio - quiet nlsy1 , indicating that a standard disc is present as also expected from the high accretion rate .",
    "future deep x - ray observations with the jet in different states are needed to explore in detail the connection between the disc and jet in this source .",
    "+ the presence of a relativistic jet in some radio - loud nlsy1 galaxies , first suggested by their variable radio emission and flat spectra , is now confirmed by the _ fermi_-lat detection of five nlsy1s in @xmath0 rays .",
    "pmn j0948@xmath10022 showed all characteristics of the blazar phenomenon with a bh mass of 10@xmath1010@xmath71 m@xmath11 , not much less than those of blazars .",
    "the impact on the @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms of the properties of the central engine in radio - loud nlsy1s , derived from their peculiar optical characteristics , is still under debate .",
    "in addition , the detection of relativistic jets in a class of agn thought to be hosted in spiral galaxies is very intriguing , challenging the theoretical scenario of relativistic jet formation proposed so far .",
    "further multifrequency observations of this object and other @xmath0-ray emitting nlsy1s will be fundamental for investigating in detail their characteristics over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
