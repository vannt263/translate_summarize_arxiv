    "schrdinger equation@xcite in real space , together with the heisenberg - born matrix formalism @xcite in momentum space , has proven to be the governing law of particle dynamics in small geometries in nonrelativistic regime .",
    "however , up to the present the nature , or the interpretation of schrdinger wave function and more generally of quantum mechanics , and a corresponding derivation of the schrdinger equation on the basis , in the first place , of the elementary classical - mechanical laws for point objects , have remained as two major unsettled aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "e. schrdinger developed his wave mechanics upon a vision of the analogy of quantum mechanical waves with classical waves@xcite , though in a phenomenological fashion .",
    "so was the earlier inspiring work of l. de broglie s hypothetical matter wave@xcite .",
    "since the foundation of quantum mechanics in the 1900s-1930s , various interpretations have been put forward .",
    "one which embraces a scheme for effectively deriving the schrdinger equation , to mention only here , is the stochastic electrodynamics approach @xcite ; this has also served an effective means for deriving the doebner - goldin nonlinear schrdinger equation@xcite .    in view of a scheme where the quantum - mechanical variables and states are the result of the _ internal processes _ of a particle , however ,",

    "a basic particle according to the bpf scheme , briefly , is formed of an oscillatory massless elementary charge of a specified sign termed a ( single ) vaculeon , and the resulting electromagnetic waves in the vacuum .",
    "the vacuum according to the model construction is filled of electrically neutral but polarizable entities termed vacuuons , each constituted of a p - vaculeon of charge @xmath1 at the core and n - vaculeon of charge @xmath2 on the envelope , bound with each other by an immense coulomb energy .",
    "a single vaculeon when disintegrated from a bound state , vacuuon , is endowed with a certain excess kinetic energy @xmath3 ; this energy can not be dissipated in the vacuum where there is no lower energy levels for it to transit to except in a pair annihilation . in a vacuuonic vacuum where",
    "the vacuuons about the single vaculeon charge are polarized and form a potential well to the latter , @xmath3 manifests as a mechanical energy .",
    "the vaculeon charge will execute oscillations in the potential well about a fixed site if @xmath3 is lesser than the energy barrier with a neighboring site , and also translate if @xmath3 greater[1  b ] . with a specified @xmath3 of a single vaculeon charge as the sole input data , the first principles classical - mechanical solutions for the resultant material particle in terms of the internal processes of the particle , have predicted [ 1  a - k ] a range of observational basic particle properties , including mass[1 b ] , spin[1 b ] , the de broglie wave function[1 b - c ] , the de broglie relations[1 b - c ] , the schrdinger equation[1 a - b , h ] , the doebner - goldin nonlinear schrdinger equation[1 i ] , the dirac equation[1  j ] , the einstein mass - energy relation[1 b , d ] , the newton s law of gravitation[1 h , k ] , and the galilean - lorentz transformation[1 h ] , among others , under corresponding conditions .    in this paper",

    "this periodic motion of the vacuum in the original , pre - superposition form corresponds directly to the electromagnetic waves generated by the charge .",
    "the mass of a particle is the result of the total motion of the charge or alternatively the waves of the particle against a frictional vacuum .",
    "we consider a particle fabricated according to the bpf scheme [ 1 b , c - g ] from a single oscillatory vaculeon charge , @xmath4 , of zero rest mass , and the resulting electromagnetic waves of frequency @xmath5 .",

    "the particle will acquire an inertial mass @xmath9 dynamically as the result of the total motion of its charge or alternatively its waves .",

    "is firstly polarized and induced with a shear elasticity . subjecting in turn to the disturbance of the charge oscillation",
    ", the now elastic vacuum is consequently produced with a periodic deformation , of transverse ( @xmath10-direction ) displacements @xmath11 and @xmath12 , generated to the charge s right and left , i.e. to the @xmath13- and @xmath14-directions , in the linear chain of vacuum along the box here , @xmath15 being a conversion factor of length unit , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 dimensionless .",
