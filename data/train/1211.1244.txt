    "then , the evolution of such a triangulation results either from an identification of two @xmath0-simplexes in the boundary of the same connected @xmath18-dimensional triangulation or in different @xmath18-dimensional triangulations .",

    "<S> in this talk , we elaborate on the operation of graph contraction introduced by gurau in his study of the schwinger - dyson equations . after a brief review of colored tensor models , we identify the lie algebra appearing in the schwinger - dyson equations as a lie algebra associated to a hopf algebra of the connes - kreimer type . </S>",
