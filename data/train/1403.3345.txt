    "laser radiation in the form of strong and short pulses finds nowadays application in many branches of physical research .",
    "the most popular example is the interaction of strong and short pulses with atomic and molecular systems , and in particular ionization of atoms and molecules . for strong fields with maximum intensities not exceeding one atomic unit ( @xmath4 )",
    "dipole approximation is sufficient to account for major features of atomic and molecular ionization  @xcite . in such cases",
    "kinetic energy of the ejected electron is small compared to its rest energy , so that motion of the photoelectron can be described in the framework of non - relativistic dynamics in a plane - wave electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the dipole and plane wave approximation fails in the case of ultrastrong tightly focused pulses , when spatial dependence of the field becomes important  @xcite and non - relativistic description of the electron motion becomes inadequate . in the purely classical approach description of focused laser radiation can be based on various forms of three dimensional non - paraxial approximation  @xcite .",
    "solutions of maxwell equations of this type were recently applied to the description of xe - photoionization in ultrastrong fields  @xcite characterized by the values of parameters for which the standard one - dimensional dipole approximation is not justified .    with the advent of ultrastrong short pulses of radiation for which the dipole approximation does not provide a sufficient theoretical description , it is desirable to formulate a theoretical approach accounting both for the propagation effects and the transverse structure of the pulse .",
    "one of the possibilities is given by non - paraxial description mentioned above , which is based on approximate solution of maxwell equations in classical electrodynamics without taking the quantum effects in electromagnetic field into account .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose fully quantum description of spatial and temporal dependence of an ultrastrong pulse of radiation by means of coherent states .",
    "although to a good approximation laser radiation can be described by classical solutions of maxwell equations , its quantum nature is also important . in particular , the use of coherent states allows not only to analyze space images of the pulse field ( as in the purely classical approach ) , but also to determine directly distribution of photon modes in the pulse .",
    "this is not possible in the case of a purely classical soluion , where the photons are simply `` absent '' , and , among various states of quantum electromagnetic field the coherent state gives a good approximation to the real laser field  @xcite .",
    "coherent states have been also used for the description of light beams in a recent publication  @xcite dealing with the uncertainty relation for light beams .",
    "electromagnetic field of a pulse of radiation is localized in a bounded region of space moving with the speed of light in the direction of pulse propagation .",
    "exact classical solutions of maxwell equations describing focused or otherwise bounded configurations of electromagnetic field have been discussed in the past  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been shown by i. biaynicki - birula and z. biaynicka - birula that , in general , the photons `` can not be sharply localized ''  @xcite , with the only exception given by coherent states , when full localization of photons is possible . in general , quantum limitations on the localization of energy density do not apply to quantum states having classical counterparts  @xcite , and coherent state is a well known example . for these reasons coherent states of quantum electromagnetic field offer , as will be seen below , an adequate description of pulsed laser radiation .",
    "the main idea of the present paper is to construct the coherent state using space - dependent annihilation and creation operators , introduced for the first time by glauber  @xcite and applied recently  @xcite in the discussion of photon localization problem .",
    "the advantage of using space - dependent operators instead of the standard monochromatic mode operators is that the approach of this type allows to obtain in a simple and direct way space and time profiles of the electric and magnetic fields of the pulse beyond dipole approximation . on the other hand",
    ", an important question is in what way one can determine the distribution of photons inside the pulse .",
    "the answer to this question requires transition from the space - time description to the , complementary to it , photon mode description , or , in other words , transition from the field to the photon picture of the pulse . it can be also considered as the question of transition from the wave - packet modes to the monochromatic modes of quantum electromagnetic field , discussed in the paper by smith and raymer  @xcite .",
    "this approach can be also used to find the photon - mode structure of the pulse of radiation .",
    "the main characteristics of the coherent state describing the pulse of radiation is its profile @xmath5 in the configuration space  @xcite and its fourier transform in the wave - vector space @xmath6 .",
    "the latter will be assumed in the gaussian form both in the longitudinal direction ( direction of propagation ) and in the transverse direction .",
    "the width of the profile in the wave - vector space in the longitudinal direction will be assumed larger than in the transverse plane of the pulse , which corresponds to a pulse with transverse dimension in the configuration space larger than in the longitudinal direction .",
    "these assumptions about the gaussian profile of the pulse allowed for the approximate analytic calculation of the expectation values of electric and magnetic field in the coherent state describing pulsed laser radiation .",
    "expectation values of the fields were further analyzed as functions of coordinates and time , and represented graphically in the form of contour plots in the @xmath7 plane , where @xmath0 is the direction of propagation of the pulse and @xmath1 is the direction of linear polarization . in general ,",
    "the electric field has two components ; the dominant @xmath1-component and the longitudinal component in the direction of propagation , so that the pulse does not constitute a purely transverse electromagnetic wave , although the longitudinal part is a few orders of magnitude smaller than the transverse one . the dominant component of the magnetic field is in the @xmath3-direction and is accompanied by small components in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions .",
    "the non - transverse contributions to electromagnetic field of the pulse vanish after sufficiently long time , when the pulse approaches a linearly polarized plane wave .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , which has a review character ,",
    "i give a brief summary of the formalism of time and coordinate dependent annihilation and creation operators based on  @xcite .",
    "section 3 contains expressions for the expectation values of the vector potential and discussion of the photon modes of the coherent state describing the pulse .",
    "the space - time structure of the pulse is discussed in details in section 4 , which also contains graphical representations of the space images of the electric and magnetic field .",
    "section 5 contains final remarks and some details of the calculations have been moved to appendices .",
    "in this review part i briefly summarize for the sake of completeness the formalism of space dependent annihilation and creation operators , presented in ref  @xcite .",

    "<S> expectation values of the electric field of a gaussian pulse propagating in the @xmath0-direction and linearly polarized in the @xmath1-direction are presented graphically in the form of contour plots in the @xmath2 plane . </S>",

    "<S> the plane wave limit of the pulse can be implemented by shrinking transverse width of the profile to zero ( transverse spatial extension goes to infinity ) , while keeping the photon density constant . </S>",
    "<S> one can then retrieve standard plane wave form of the pulse also in the dipole approximation . </S>"
