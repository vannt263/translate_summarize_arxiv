    "however , it is easy to verify considering @xmath70 , that pdfs of @xmath15-exponential type makes @xmath17 extensive , since it is the inverse @xmath57-function , while pdfs of ( @xmath31)-exponential form do not . according to gmc approach",

    "we conclude that the pdfs which maximize @xmath17 are the @xmath15-exponential ones , ( @xmath73 and not @xmath74 ) , with ordinary mean values and @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we notice that , the distribution @xmath74 maximizes the entropy @xmath75 with ordinary mean values .",
    "> from gmc we determine the range of @xmath15-values for @xmath75 which vary between @xmath76 $ ] . as can be seen , the distinction between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is very important since they are related to different entropic structures .",
    "it is a very common mistake in literature to consider a @xmath79 distribution calling it @xmath15-exponential , although it is a ( @xmath31)-exponential distribution .",
    "this is the reason of obtaining in these cases a @xmath15-value greater than unity .",
    "same as in case of @xmath17 , the application of jf on rnyi entropy leads to @xmath15-exponential and ( @xmath31)-exponential distributions for ordinary and escort mean values , respectively .",
    "the external function of @xmath80 is an ordinary logarithm , thus none of the aforementioned distributions makes rnyi entropy extensive . according to gmc approach , for both gmc - definitions @xmath18",

    "these results are in agreement with the concept of extensivity . in fig .",
    "[ fig.renyi ] we present some plots of the rnyi entropy for equal probabilities and @xmath81 types of elements , considering the jf maximum pdfs given by @xmath82 and the gmc maximum pdfs given by @xmath83 .",

    "thus , pdfs obtained from jf do clearly not maximize the rnyi entropy .      in case of nonextensive gaussian",
    "entropy one obtains from jf with ordinary and escort mean value constraints ordinary and @xmath36-exponential distributions .",
    "however , considering @xmath86 , we verify that both distributions do not preserve extensivity .",
    "the pdfs which maximize @xmath19 are @xmath15-exponential distributions , as in eq .",

    "accordingly , the neg - entropy is optimized by pdfs of @xmath15-exponential type .",
    "figneg.eps    the above discussion implies , with regard to gmc approach , that only the definition @xmath87 gives proper results , and with regard to jf , that the correctness of the obtained maximum pdfs for an entropic structure is not guaranteed . in the next section we shall demonstrate the origin of the observed inconsistencies within jf .",
    "the computation of the maximum pdf for a given entropic definition and the determination of the parameter range through the respective gmc is not part of the scope of this article and will be explored separately .",
    "let us first consider the bgs - entropy in eq .",
    "( [ bgs ] ) .",
    "the inner structure of @xmath6 is of the form @xmath88 .",

    "( [ maxconffun1 ] ) and ( [ maxentfun1 ] ) for @xmath5 ) .",

    "( [ tsallisentropy ] ) . here",
