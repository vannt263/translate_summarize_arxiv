    "since its discovery as an extremely low - metallicity galaxy , the blue compact galaxy ( bcg ) sbs 0335052 ( sbs  second byurakan survey ) has been identified as a likely nearby young dwarf galaxy ( izotov et al .",
    "1990 ) . this chemically - unevolved galaxy , with an oxygen abundance 1/40 solar ( terlevich et al . 1992 ;",
    "melnick , heydary - malayeri & leisy 1992 ; izotov et al .",
    "1996 ) , is the second most metal - deficient bcg known , after i zw 18 , whose oxygen abundance is 1/50 ( o / h)@xmath5 ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) .",
    "further evidence in favor of the evolutionary youth of sbs 0335052 has been presented in several subsequent studies : hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xmath6 imaging of this galaxy ( thuan , izotov & lipovetsky 1996 , hereafter til96 ) has shown blue @xmath7 colors not only in the region of current star formation , but also in the extended , low - intensity envelope 4 kpc in diameter .",
    "the emission from the underlying component , with @xmath7 = 0.00.2 , appears likely to arise from the combined effect of emission from ionized gas and from young ( @xmath810@xmath4 yr ) stars ( izotov et al .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) map of sbs  0335052 shows the presence of a large extended hi cloud , 64 kpc in size , at the same redshift , having a mass two orders of magnitude larger than that of the observed stars ( thuan et al .",
    "two prominent , slightly - resolved hi peaks , separated by 24 kpc , have been detected , the eastern peak coinciding approximately with sbs 0335052 . by comparing the vla map to the digital sky survey ( dss ) , pustilnik et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found an optical counterpart of the western hi peak which they designated as sbs  0335052w .",
    "the redshift of this faint , slightly elongated compact galaxy , measured from an 6 m telescope optical spectrum , is close to that of sbs  0335052 , suggesting that these two galaxies and the hi cloud form a single system .",
    "pustilnik et al .",
    "( 1996 ) did not detect either [ nii ] or [ sii ] lines in sbs 0335052w and concluded that this object may be a low - metallicity young galaxy . however , this conclusion is based on a low s / n spectrum in the range @xmath9@xmath948007200 so that the oxygen abundance was not derived . in this paper",
    "we present new mmt spectrophotometric observations and 3.5 m calar alto telescope ccd @xmath10 photometry , derive for the first time the oxygen abundance and obtain @xmath10 and @xmath3 profiles in sbs 0335052w .",
    "these data are used to study its evolutionary status .",
    "the optical spectra of sbs 0335052w were obtained on 1996 january 19 with the red channel of the mmt spectrograph , using the 300 g / mm grating which provides a dispersion of 3   pixel@xmath11 and a spectral resolution of about 10   in first order . to avoid second - order contamination",
    "an l-38 blocking filter was used , and the total spectral range covered was @xmath9@xmath937007300  .",
    "we used a 1@xmath12@xmath13 180@xmath12 slit , and the spectra were rebinned by a factor of 2 along the spatial axis , yielding a spatial sampling of 0.6 arcsec pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the total exposure time was 60 min , broken to three exposures of 20 min for effective cosmic ray removal .",
    "the slit was oriented north - south .",
    "standard stars pg 0205 + 134 and feige 15 were observed for absolute flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he  ne  ar comparison lamps were obtained before and after each observation to provide wavelength calibration .",
    "the data reduction was carried out at the noao headquarters in tucson using the iraf software package .",
    "procedures included bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal and flat - field correction using exposures of a quartz incandescent lamp .",
    "after wavelength mapping and night sky background subtraction each frame was corrected for atmospheric extinction and flux calibrated .",
    "the spectrum of the brightest 1@xmath12@xmath142@xmath12 region of sbs 0335052w is shown in figure 1 .",
    "table 1 lists the observed line intensities and intensities corrected for interstellar extinction for sbs 0335052w along with the equivalent width , ew(h@xmath15 ) , the observed h@xmath15 emission line flux , and the extinction coefficient c(h@xmath15 ) . to correct for extinction we used the galactic reddening law by whitford ( 1958 ) . to derive the oxygen abundance in sbs",
    "0335052w we adopted a two - zone photoionized hii region model ( stasinska 1990 ) .",
    "the electron temperature , @xmath16(oiii ) , is derived from the [ oiii]@xmath94363/(@xmath94959 + 5007 ) line intensity ratio , and the electron temperature @xmath16(oii ) from the relation between @xmath16(oii ) and @xmath16(oiii ) fitted by izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1994 , hereafter itl94 ) for photoionized hii models by stasinska ( 1990 ) . because of the weakness of [ oiii]@xmath94363 , which is barely detected , the inferred value of the electron temperature is not very reliable .",
    "derived values of @xmath16(oiii ) and @xmath16(oii ) are shown in table 2 ; they are 4000  5000k lower than those for sbs 0335052 ( izotov et al .",
    "for the electron number density @xmath17 , we adopted 100 @xmath18 since the [ sii]@xmath96717 , 6731 lines are weak .",
    "the ionic and total oxygen abundances are derived as described by itl94 and are shown in table 2 .",
    "the abundances of other elements have not been derived because the weakness of their emission lines renders such a determination unreliable .",
    "the @xmath0,@xmath1 photometric observations of sbs  0335052w were obtained during the study of sbs  0335052 with the 3.5 m telescope in calar alto on 1991 october 6 .",
    "the ccd camera was installed at prime focus where , at f/3.5 , with the 1152 @xmath14 770 pixel gec ccd ( 22.5 @xmath19 m pixels ) , the field of view is 7.3@xmath204.9@xmath21 .",
    "two exposures of 600s and 900s were taken in @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "two clusters , m92 and ngc 7790 were observed as photometric standards .",
    "the photometric calibration was made using the data of christian et al .",
    "( 1985 ) .",
    "all data reduction was done with midas .",
    "the frames were corrected for bias , dark , flat field and , in the @xmath1 passband , for fringe - pattern .",
    "unfortunately , the fringe - pattern correction was not very good and there was some residual structure in both the horizontal and vertical directions as result of additional noise in the ccd readout .",
    "this structure was corrected by applying median filters separately in the x- and y - directions .",
    "for photometry of extended objects , we used the package surfphot as well as dedicated software for adaptive filtering developed at the astrophysical institute of potsdam ( lorenz et al .",
    "the adaptive filter allows one to reduce pixel noise by a factor of 34 times without loss of spatial resolution of the bright cores of stars and galaxies and to retain the object s total flux as well .",
    "the smoothing scale of the adaptive filter was 11@xmath1411 pixels . before applying an adaptive filter",
    "a special mask was built , where all bright stars and galaxies were masked out .",
    "such a mask is necessary for proper determination of noise statistics used by the filter .",
    "the brightness profile was fitted by several different models  exponential disk , @xmath22 , and linear compositions there of .",
    "elliptical fitting was performed with fit / ell3 in the surfphot package ; the fitting algorithm is described by bender & moellenhoff ( 1987 ) . to construct a surface brightness profile we used the geometrical average , @xmath23=@xmath24 , as the average radius .",
    "the @xmath0 image of sbs  0335052w clearly shows evidence of a wisp in the eastern direction which is absent on the @xmath1 frame .",
    "this could be an h@xmath25 emission feature similar to that observed in sbs  0335052 , but in the nw  se direction .",
    "unfortunately , the slit in our mmt spectrum was oriented n  s and so did not cover that feature .",
    "the @xmath0 images , isophotes and profiles with their decomposition for sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w are shown in fig.2 .",
    "formally , the outer regions of both galaxies profiles are well fitted by an exponential law , but , as described in the next section , we do not present the fitting parameters because of the strong bias introduced by the presence of gaseous emission .",
    "the existence of sbs 0335052w poses several important questions : a ) how is this galaxy related to the brighter , extremely low - metallicity galaxy sbs 0335052 ?",
    "b ) if this system of galaxies is physically connected , what is its evolutionary state ?",
    "is it an evolved system of galaxies , or are we observing a system of nearby young dwarf galaxies during their formation ?",
    "c ) if this system of galaxies is young , what do its properties tell us to expect in searches for primeval galaxies ?    in table 3 we summarize the general characteristics of sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w .",
    "our measurement of the heliocentric radial velocity for sbs 0335052w is in excellent agreement with that of sbs 0335052 , and confirms the conclusion of pustilnik et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w are physically related and are two sites of star formation in the large cloud of neutral gas detected by the vla observations of thuan et al .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this system is probably at a very early stage of its evolution .    further evidence for common evolution of the two hii regions in the sbs 0335052 system is provided by spectroscopic observations of sbs 0335052w .",
    "the spectrum of this hii region shows stronger low ionization [ oii]@xmath93727 emission ( figure 1 ) and displays more moderate ionization as compared with the spectrum of the brighter companion .",
    "the lower ew(h@xmath15 ) in sbs 0335052w implies that the present burst of star formation therein is older by few times 10@xmath26 yr than that in sbs 0335052 .",
    "the oxygen abundance in sbs 0335052w is 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.45@xmath20.22 , among the lowest known for dwarf emission - line galaxies .",
    "it is slightly larger than 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.33 derived by izotov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for sbs 0335052 , implying , along with the lower ew(h@xmath15 ) , that the present burst of star formation in sbs 0335052w is 12 myr older than in sbs 0335052 .",
    "based on the blue @xmath7 hst color and from a combined analysis of the spectral and photometric observations , til96 concluded that sbs 0335052 is probably a young galaxy with an age not greater than 10@xmath27yr .",
    "however , izotov et al . (",
    "1996 ) have shown that the underlying stellar emission in sbs 0335052 is strongly contaminated by emission from ionized gas . therefore photometric observations alone are not enough to permit us to draw any definite conclusions about the presence of an underlying stellar component .",
    "further spectroscopic observations are necessary to discriminate between stellar and gaseous emission .    in figure 2 we present the @xmath10 and @xmath3 profiles for both sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w obtained at calar alto .",
    "the surface brightness distribution in @xmath1 for sbs 0335052 agrees well with that obtained by til96 , and the integrated @xmath1 magnitude derived from both observations agree to within 0.05 mag .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 profiles for sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w at large distances are fitted well by an exponential law .",
    "the @xmath3 color in both hii regions gets redder with increasing radius ; however , for sbs 0335052 , the color is significantly , @xmath280.3 mag , bluer . in the central parts of the hii regions ,",
    "emission from young massive stars dominates .",
    "what is the origin of the extended low - intensity underlying component ?",
    "models of stellar population synthesis by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) predict that , for an instantaneous star - formation burst , the @xmath3 color is @xmath280.0 for log @xmath29 = 6.5 and @xmath280.30.4 for log @xmath29 = 8.0 , where @xmath29 is age of the burst in yr .",
    "the @xmath3 color for the extended emission in sbs 0335052 is bluer than that for a burst with log @xmath29 = 6.5 , and the extended emission in sbs 0335052w is bluer than that for a burst with age log @xmath29 = 8.0 .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath3 color in both hii regions is significantly modified by the presence of ionized gas emission .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in sbs 0335052 because of its stronger lines .",
    "the @xmath0 passband is more subject to the influence of gaseous emission because of the presence of h@xmath25 within the passband .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) discussed the influence of ionized gas emission on @xmath30 magnitudes in sbs 0335052 and found that 2/3 of the continuum light in the extended low - intensity component comes from a stellar population with age 10@xmath4yr . in the central part of sbs 0335052w , ew(h@xmath25)@xmath28500   and @xmath3 = 0.3 mag .",
    "taking a 1500  passband for r , we derive @xmath3 @xmath28 0.0 for the central part of sbs 0335052w , a color commensurate with that predicted by models of a young burst . the correction for h@xmath25 emission in sbs 0335052 is larger because of its larger ew(h@xmath25)@xmath281000  ( izotov et al . 1996 ) and is equal to @xmath280.5 mag , just the value needed to adjust the @xmath3 color to that for a young burst .",
    "h@xmath25 emission is not observed at distances @xmath23@xmath313@xmath12 from the center of sbs  0335052w ; therefore correction for gaseous emission is not needed .",
    "the observed color @xmath3 = 0.30.4 in the outer envelope could be explained by the presence of an older stellar population with age @xmath8100 myr .",
    "hence , @xmath10 photometry for both sbs  0335052 and sbs  0335052w provides evidence of a low age and suggests a common origin of the star - forming regions during the last @xmath8100 myr .",
    "the most likely mechanism for synchronization of star formation in two regions separated by 24 kpc could be the contraction of a protogalaxy .",
    "adopting from til96 the number density of neutral gas to be @xmath280.11 @xmath18 , we derive a free - fall time of @xmath8100 myr , in agreement with estimates of the age of the stellar population .",
    "the distribution of older stars within a region @xmath28 1 kpc in size could be explained by random motions of order @xmath2810 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the system of galaxies sbs",
    "0335052 is similar to the dwarf galaxy associated with the 1225 + 01 large hi cloud in virgo discovered by giovanelli & haynes ( 1989 ) .",
    "the hi distribution of 1225 + 01 shows two peaks separated by 15 arcmin , or 45 kpc , if a distance 10 mpc is adopted .",
    "optical knots resembling hii regions coincide with one of the peaks ; the other , however , has no optical counterpart .",
    "salzer et al .",
    "( 1991 ) presented a detailed optical imaging and spectroscopic study of the dwarf irregular galaxy located at the main peak of the hi cloud , and found the entire galaxy to be very blue .",
    "nebular abundances derived from their spectroscopic data reveal that this object is relatively unevolved chemically , although its oxygen abundance of 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.66 is twice that in the main component of sbs 0335052 system .",
    "furthermore , salzer et al . found that only a tiny fraction ( 0.02%  0.60% ) of the mass in the ne clump of hi 1225 + 01 is contained in stars .",
    "a similar value is found in the sbs 0335052 system ( izotov et al .",
    "however , the luminosity and star formation rate in this system is an order of magnitude larger . on the basis of chemical evolution and color evolution models , salzer et al . concluded that the galaxy associated with the hi 1225 + 01 cloud is still undergoing formation and the stellar population of this galaxy is likely to be no older than roughly 1 gyr .",
    "if our conclusion about the youth of sbs 0335052 is correct , we can compare properties of this young galaxy with theoretical predictions and properties of high - redshift galaxies which are often considered to be primeval . in sbs 0335052 ,",
    "the ly@xmath25 emission line is not observed ( til96 ) , contrary to theoretical predictions for young galaxies ( charlot & fall 1993 ) .",
    "the small mass , @xmath28 10@xmath27m@xmath5 , of the older stellar population in sbs 0335052 suggests that the star formation rate during the first 100 myr was only 0.11 m@xmath5 yr@xmath11 . during this period only 1% of the gaseous mass",
    "was transformed into stars , contrary to predictions of several models of galaxy formation ( meier 1976 ; baron & white 1987 ; lin & murray 1992 ) , where a significant fraction of the gas is converted into stars during the collapse time .",
    "probably the formation of galaxies , or at least of dwarf galaxies , is a more quiescent process with moderate conversion of gas into stars .",
    "this could explain why primeval galaxies are not detected in deep ly@xmath25 images and other surveys at large redshifts ( pritchett 1994 ) .",
    "several objects have been put forward as possible primeval galaxies , mainly on the basis of their very high luminosity and star formation activity ( fontana et al .",
    "1996 ; pettini , lipman & hunstead 1995 ; yee et al .",
    "however , most of these candidate primeval galaxies already contain a substantial amount of heavy elements , implying previous star formation and metal - enrichment .",
    "properties of these objects are very different from those for sbs 0335052 and imply either that these galaxies are already evolved systems or that formation scenarios for galaxies with different masses are different . in any case , we expect that a detailed study of the sbs 0335052 system could provide important constraints on models of galaxy formation and could assist in the search for primeval galaxies at large redshifts .",
