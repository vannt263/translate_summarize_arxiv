    "the epoch of reionization marks the second major change in the ionization state of the universe .",
    "reionization begins when the first sources of neutral hydrogen ( ) ionizing photons form within dark matter potential wells and start building an ionization region around themselves , the so - called strmgren sphere .",
    "however , the reionization history and the redshift at which it ends still remain the subject of much discussion .",
    "this is because the reionization process depends on a number of parameters including the initial mass function ( imf ) of the first sources , their star formation rates ( sfr ) , their stellar metallicity and age , the escape fraction of ionizing photons produced by each source and the clumping of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , to name a few .",
    "given the large number of free parameters that inevitably enter into the construction of theoretical reionization models , it is imperative to compare and update the models as fresh data sets are acquired . in this sense , it has been suggested ( malhotra & rhoads 2004 , 2005 ; santos 2004 ; mesinger , haiman & cen 2004 ; haiman & cen 2005 ; dijkstra , lidz & wyithe 2007 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2008 ; dayal , ferrara & gallerani 2008 ; dayal et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) that a class of high redshift galaxies called lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) could be an important addition to complementary data sets to constrain the reionization history .",
    "laes , galaxies identified by means of their very strong ly@xmath0 line ( 1216  ) emission , have been becoming increasingly popular as probes of reionization for three primary reasons .",
    "firstly , specific signatures like the strength , width and the continuum break bluewards of the ly@xmath0 line make the detection of laes unambiguous to a large degree .",
    "secondly , since ly@xmath0 photons have a large absorption cross - section against , their attenuation can be used to put constraints on the ionization state of the igm .",
    "thirdly , there are hundreds of confirmed laes at @xmath5 ( finkelstein et al .",
    "2007 ) , @xmath2 ( malhotra et al . 2005 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ) and @xmath6 ( taniguchi et al . 2005 ; kashikawa et al . 2006 ) , which exactly probe the redshift range around which reionization is supposed to have ended .    the data accumulated on laes shows some very surprising features ; while the apparent ly@xmath0 luminosity function ( lf ) does not show any evolution between @xmath7 - @xmath8 ( ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ) , it changes appreciably between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 ( the luminosity of the break , after which the number density decreases rapidly ) at @xmath12 ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ) being about 50% of the value at @xmath9 ( shimasaku et al .",
    "unexpectedly , however , the ultraviolet ( uv ) lf does not show any evolution between these same redshifts .",
    "although kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have proposed this evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf to be indicative of a sudden change in the ionization state of the igm , the problem of why reionization would affect the high luminosity tail of the ly@xmath0 lf rather than the faint end , as expected , remains .    in spite of a number of diverse approaches ,",
    "the effects of the ionization state of the the igm on the visibility of laes still remain poorly understood .",
    "this is primarily because understanding/ constraining the ionization state of the igm using laes requires : ( a ) a detailed knowledge of the physical properties of each galaxy , including the sfr , stellar age and stellar metallicity , needed to calculate the intrinsic ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity produced by stellar sources , ( b ) the intrinsic ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity produced by the cooling of collisionally excited in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , ( c ) an understanding of the dust formation , enrichment and distribution in each galaxy , necessary to calculate the fractions of escaping ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , and ( d ) a full radiative transfer ( rt ) calculation to obtain the fraction of ly@xmath0 luminosity transmitted through the igm for each galaxy .",
    "although a number of simulations have been used in the past to study laes , they lack one or more of the aforementioned ingredients . since they used an n - body simulation , mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) were forced to neglect the intrinsic properties of the galaxies and their dust enrichment , although they carried out analytic rt .",
    "iliev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used a simulation that only followed dark matter ; they also could not use the intrinsic galaxy properties or calculate the dust enrichment , although they carried out a complete rt calculation .",
    "nagamine et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used an sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) simulation to obtain the intrinsic sfr for each galaxy ; however , they did not calculate the dust enrichment and assumed a fixed value of the igm transmission , ignoring rt .",
    "dayal et al .",
    "( 2009a , 2009b ) used an sph simulation and the intrinsic galaxy properties to calculate the luminosity from both stellar sources and cooling of , calculated the dust enrichment and the igm transmission ; the only missing ingredient in their work was the rt calculation .",
    "most recently , zheng et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have carried out a rt calculation on an sph simulation ; however , they have not included any dust calculation or the luminosity contribution from the cooling of .",
    "our aim in this work is to build a lae model containing all these ingredients , so as to determine the relative importance of dust , peculiar velocity fields and patchy reionization , in shaping the observed ly@xmath0 and uv lfs .",
    "we start with an introduction to the sph and rt simulations used in sec .",

    "we conclude by mentioning the caveats and shortcomings of our model in sec .",
    "the simulations used in this work are based on a @xmath13cdm cosmological model with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and a scale invariant power spectrum of the initial density perturbations is normalized to @xmath19 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 and uv lfs presented in this work are based on the results from combined runs of sph and rt simulations , carried out using gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) and crash ( maselli , ferrara & ciardi 2003 ; maselli , ciardi & kanekar 2009 ) respectively , which are coupled to a previously developed lae model ( dayal et al .",
    "2008 ; dayal et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "gadget-2 generates the redshift evolution of the density field , the baryonic density distribution and the velocity fields in a 100@xmath20 mpc comoving volume ; we obtain a snapshot of the simulation at @xmath21 . the specific simulation used in this work",
    "is the g5 run described in springel and hernquist ( 2003 ) , which is part of an accurate study focused on modelling the star formation history of the universe .",
    "we have chosen the g5 run since it contains several physical ingredients necessary for our investigation .",
    "firstly , the volume is large enough so that cosmic variance is minimized in the determination of the lfs .",
    "secondly , the sfr ( @xmath22 ) is self - consistently inferred from physically motivated prescriptions that convert gas particles into stellar particles and that properly take account of the mechanical / chemical feedback associated to supernovae and galactic winds .",
    "this point is particularly relevant since the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxies , both in the ly@xmath0 and uv , depends sensitively on @xmath22 .",
    "also , since the physics governing star formation and galaxy evolution is modelled accurately , the simulation gives us a reliable representation of the galaxy population .",
    "as expected , the large simulation volume naturally leads to a relatively coarse mass resolution with the resolution mass being @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 @xmath24 ) for dark matter ( gas particles ) . running a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm on the sph particle distribution",
    ", we identify galaxies and obtain their intrinsic properties , including @xmath22 , the mass weighted stellar metallicity ( @xmath26 ) , the total gas and stellar masses .",
    "these are then used to calculate the intrinsic ly@xmath0/continuum luminosity , the dust enrichment and the escape fraction of continuum / ly@xmath0 photons from the galaxy .",
    "all these are presented and discussed in greater detail in sec .",
    "[ model ] and [ reio effects ] .",
    "the rt calculations have been carried out in post - processing mode using the 3d crash code .",
    "the main assumptions made for running crash are the following : ( a ) we initially assume , at @xmath27 , the gas to be in photoionization equilibrium with a uniform ultraviolet background ( uvb ) produced by sources below the simulation resolution scale , corresponding to an average neutral hydrogen fraction , @xmath28 , ( b ) we assume that galaxies have formed stars in the past at an average rate @xmath22 , equal to the one derived at @xmath27 and ( c ) since the rt simulation is carried out on a sph snapshot which contains about 2500 galaxies , to reduce the computational running time , we run the rt calculation in the monochromatic mode , with @xmath29 ev .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the ly@xmath0 lfs depend mostly on the average ionization fraction and on the 3d topology of the fully ionized regions ; we are therefore not interested in the detailed profiles of the ionization front or a highly accurate estimate of the igm temperature , to probe which the ionizing radiation of each galaxy would have to be computed from its spectrum .",
    "the specific photoionization rate is calculated using the expression given in eq .",
    "12 of dayal , ferrara & gallerani ( 2008 ) and then averaging this value over @xmath26 and stellar ages ( @xmath30 ) of the galaxies in the the sph simulation .",
    "the contribution from all the galaxies determined under the above - mentioned assumptions is then super - imposed on the average uvb value .",
    "finally , we use @xmath31 ( gnedin et al .",
    "2008 ) , as a characteristic value of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from each galaxy . the total ionizing radiation field , which is the sum of that produced by all galaxies identified in the simulation and the uvb , is then evolved with crash up to the hubble time corresponding to @xmath21 . however , as we are interested in assessing the visibility of lae as a function of the mean ionization fraction which could correspond to different epochs along any assigned reionization history , no particular meaning should be attached to the redshift parameter .    in fig .",
    "[ rt_maps ] we show maps of the fraction across a 2d cut through the rt simulation box , at different simulation times .",
    "this time sequence then represents a time - line of the reionization process , due to the galaxy population present within the box . though an approximation , this description catches many of the important features of the reionization process , including the complex topology produced by the inhomogeneities in the density field , by the galaxy properties and by their spatial distribution .",
    "[ rt_maps ] clearly shows the reionization process in its main three phases .",
    "first , isolated ionized hydrogen ( ) regions start growing around point sources which are preferentially located along the over - dense filaments of matter . in this stage",
    "the size of the isolated regions grows differentially according to the production rate of ionizing photons from the specific source ; the few galaxies with large @xmath22 ( e.g. the largest galaxy located at the center having @xmath32 ) can build an ionized region of about 20 mpc , in a time as short as 10 myr ( see upper - left panel ) , which grows at a very fast rate due to the vigorous ionizing photon output .",
    "if observed at the same evolutionary timescale , due to the smaller ionizing photon budget , the regions of smaller galaxies are confined to sizes of the order of few mpc ( @xmath33 ) , which grow slowly .",
    "after 10 myr of continuous star formation activity , the average neutral hydrogen fraction decreases only to @xmath34 . at this early stage ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath35 , transmit only about 20% of their ly@xmath0 luminosity through the igm .",
    "consequently the low luminosity end of the lf is depressed with respect to the intrinsic emissivity of these sources . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies with larger @xmath22 are able to transmit a larger amount ( @xmath36% ) of their luminosity through the igm .",
    "as the ionizing photon production from galaxies continues , the sizes of the regions increase with time . at about @xmath37 myr ( upper right panel ) , the isolated regions start overlapping , resulting in an enhancement of the local photo - ionization rate close to the smaller sources .",
    "this allows the ionized regions associated to the latter to grow faster , and results in the build - up of large regions also around smaller galaxies .",
    "this results in an enhancement in the transmission of the ly@xmath0 luminosity for these sources , such that this value increases to @xmath38% , consequently leading to a boost of the low - luminosity end of the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "as expected , the overlap phase speeds - up the reionization process ; for a star formation time @xmath39 myr , @xmath40 decreases to @xmath41 , respectively .    finally at about 300 myr ( lower center panel ) ,",
    "the simulation volume is almost completely ionized .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the post - overlap phase which leads to a further acceleration of the reionization process . for about 400 myr of star formation activity",
    ", @xmath42 drops to a value of about @xmath43 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that , as the igm becomes more ionized , even the ionizing radiation from the numerous smaller galaxies contributes to the overall radiation field .",
    "it is very important to point out that , even in this final stage , the ionization field is highly inhomogeneous , with regions of higher ionization fraction corresponding to the environment of point ionizing sources ( green regions in the maps ) .",
    "this topology is of fundamental importance in the estimation of the ly@xmath0 lfs , as the ly@xmath0 transmissivity associated to each source depends on the extent of the highly ionized regions as well as on the residual neutral hydrogen within them ; a very tiny fraction of residual neutral hydrogen is sufficient to suppress the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity significantly .",
    "even for an ionization fraction , @xmath44 , which results after 500 myr of star formation , the transmission value ranges between @xmath45% for galaxies with increasing @xmath22 ; the blue part of the line can be significantly attenuated even by the tiny residual fraction of about @xmath46 , close to the source .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ simulations ] , for each galaxy in the sph simulation snapshot , we obtain the sfr , @xmath22 , the mass weighted stellar metallicity , @xmath26 , the total gas mass , @xmath47 , and the stellar mass , @xmath48 ; the stellar age is then calculated as @xmath49 , i.e. assuming a constant sfr .",
    "this assumption has been made for consistency with the rt calculation ( see sec .  [ simulations ] ) .",
    "these properties are then used to calculate the intrinsic ly@xmath0 ( @xmath50 ) and continuum luminosity ( @xmath51 ) , considering the contribution from both stellar sources and from the cooling of collisionally excited in the ism of the galaxy .",
    "the intrinsic values of the ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities so obtained can then be used to calculate the observed luminosity values .",
    "it is comparatively easy to calculate the observed continuum luminosity , @xmath52 , since the wavelength range ( 1250 - 1500  ) of the continuum luminosity band is chosen so as to be unaffected by ; @xmath52 in fact only depends on the fraction of the continuum photons , @xmath53 , that escape the galactic environment undamped by dust , i.e. @xmath54    on the other hand , since ly@xmath0 photons have a large absorption cross - section against , the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath55 , depends both on : ( a ) the fraction of ly@xmath0 photons , @xmath56 , that escape out of the galaxy into the igm , undamped by dust and ( b ) the fraction , @xmath57 , of these  escaped \" photons that are transmitted through the igm , undamped by .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity can therefore be expressed as @xmath58    all galaxies with @xmath59 and an observed equivalent width , @xmath60 are identified as laes and used to construct the cumulative ly@xmath0 and uv lfs which can then be compared to the observations . in principle , our results can be compared to both the observed lfs at @xmath2 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , there exists a huge uncertainty between the complete photometric and confirmed spectroscopic sample at @xmath6 ; we limit the comparison between the theoretical model and observations to the data accumulated at @xmath2 by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in this work .",
    "the calculations of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath56 , @xmath53 and @xmath57 are explained in more detail in what follows .",
    "star formation produces photons with energies @xmath61  ryd , which ionize the in the ism . due to the high density of the ism ,",
    "recombinations take place on a short time scale and this produces a large number of ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "the stellar luminosity component is calculated by using starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , a population synthesis code , to obtain the spectra and hence , the ionizing photon rate ( @xmath62 ) of each galaxy , using a salpeter imf , @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath22 as input parameters . then the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity produced by stellar sources @xmath63 , is calculated as @xmath64 where @xmath65 , for consistency with the rt calculation ( see sec . [ simulations ] ) , @xmath66 is the planck constant , @xmath67 is the frequency of the ly@xmath0 photons and the factor of two - thirds enters assuming case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) . the intrinsic continuum luminosity produced by stellar sources , @xmath68 , is calculated at 1375  , at the middle of the continuum band between 1250 - 1500  .",
    "the ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosity from the cooling of collisionally excited in each galaxy ( @xmath69 respectively ) is calculated using the number density of electrons and , which depend on the temperature distribution of the ism gas mass and the gas distribution scale of the galaxy .",
    "the temperature dependence comes from the fact that the recombination coefficient , which determines the neutral hydrogen fraction in the ism , decreases sensitively with higher temperatures .",
    "the number density is calculated by assuming a primordial ism composition ( @xmath70 hydrogen and @xmath71 helium ) and calculating the gas distribution scale assuming the to be concentrated in a radius , @xmath72 . here",
    "the spin parameter , @xmath73 ( ferrara , pettini & shchekinov 2000 ) and @xmath74 is the virial radius , assuming the collapsed region has an overdensity of 200 times the critical density at the redshift considered .",
    "the calculation of the electron number density requires a knowledge of the temperature distribution of the igm gas .",
    "however , since we do not have this information from the sph simulation used in this work , we use the temperature distribution averaged over distinct halo mass ranges shown in tab . 1 of dayal et al .",
    "( 2009b ) and again use the gas distribution scale to calculate the electron number density .",
    "complete details of this calculation can be found in sec .",
    "3.2 of dayal et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "it is important to model the dust in the ism of galaxies since it absorbs both ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , thereby , strongly influencing the observed luminosity values .",
    "dust is produced both by supernovae and evolved stars in a galaxy .",
    "however , several authors ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; dwek et al .",
    "2007 ) have shown that the contribution of agb stars can be neglected for @xmath75 , since the typical evolutionary time - scale of these stars ( @xmath76 gyr ) becomes longer than the age of the universe above that redshift .",
    "hence , assuming snii to be the primary dust factories at @xmath21 , we calculate the dust enrichment for each galaxy , taking into account three processes : ( a ) snii produce dust in the expanding ejecta ; the average dust mass produced per snii is taken to be @xmath77 ( todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2007 ; bianchi & schneider 2007 ) , ( b ) snii destroy dust in the ism they shock to velocities @xmath78 , for which we use a destruction efficiency value @xmath79 ( mckee 1989 ) , and ( c ) a homogeneous mixture of gas and dust is assimilated into star formation ( astration ) .",
    "once the final dust mass , @xmath80 , is calculated for each galaxy in the simulation , we can translate this into an optical depth , @xmath81 , for continuum photons as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the dust surface mass density , @xmath84 is the radius of dust distribution , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the radius and material density of graphite / carbonaceous grains , respectively ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 ) . this can be used to obtain the escape fraction of continuum photons from the galaxy as @xmath89 .",

    "( 2009b ) .    different extinction curves , including that for the milky way , small magellanic cloud and for supernovae give different relations between the extinction of the ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , for homogeneously distributed dust . in this spirit , and",
    "to get a hint of the dust inhomogeneity , we combine @xmath56 and @xmath53 , and use the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons relative to the continuum ones , @xmath90 , to be the free parameter to calculate @xmath55 in our model .",

    "although computationally more expensive than the above approximations , using the voigt profile to compute the absorption cross - section gives precise results , and therefore we have implemented it in our code to obtain all the results presented below .",
    "the total ly@xmath0 optical depth is calculated for each galaxy identified in the crash outputs corresponding to @xmath127 as mentioned in sec .",

    "the transmission along any los is calculated as @xmath128 , integrating from the position of each galaxy to the edge of the box . to get a statistical estimate of the transmission , we construct 6 los starting from the position of each galaxy , one along each of the box axes , for each of the mentioned ionization states .",
    "the average value of the transmission for each galaxy is then obtained by averaging the transmission over the 6 los .",
    "this is done for all the ionization state configurations resulting from the rt calculation .",
    "once the above model is in place , the only _ two free parameters _ of our model to match the theoretical ly@xmath0 and uv lfs to the observed ones are : the dust distribution radius , @xmath84 , and the relative escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons as compared to the continuum photons , @xmath90 .",
    "both these parameters remain quite poorly understood due to a lack of observational data about the dust distribution / topology in high - redshift galaxies ; they must therefore be inferred by comparing the theoretical lfs to the observed ones .",
    "details on how these parameters are determined follow in sec .  [ reio effects ] .",
    "once the combined sph+rt calculations are carried out and the lae model implemented , we are in a position to quantify the importance of reionization , peculiar velocities and the dust enrichment on the observed lfs .",
    "physically , the reionization process leads to a decrease in @xmath42 , thereby increasing @xmath57 ; on the other hand , peculiar velocities caused by galactic scale outflows ( inflows ) , redshift ( blueshift ) the ly@xmath0 photons , thereby leading to a higher ( lower ) value of @xmath57 .",
    "a handle on the dust enrichment is necessary since dust grains absorb both ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , thereby affecting their escape fractions from the galaxy .",
    "we begin our study by ignoring the effects of the peculiar velocities and assuming all the galaxies to be dust free , to quantify how each of these two parameters shapes the observed ly@xmath0 and uv lfs .",
    "the former assumption means that @xmath129 in eqs .",
    "[ gauss ] , [ lorentz ] ; the latter implies that all photons produced inside the galaxy escape into the igm , i.e. @xmath130 in eqs .",
    "[ lc_int ] , [ la_int ] .",
    "we then use the prescriptions detailed in sec .  [ model ] to identify the galaxies that would be visible as laes in each crash output and build their ly@xmath0 lf , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lya_novel_nodust ] .",
    "since both peculiar velocities and dust are neglected , in this case , while the uv lf is simply the intrinsic lf , the ly@xmath0 lf is shaped solely by the transmission through the igm .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ simulations ] , after a star formation time scale as short as 10 myr ( @xmath131 ) , the galaxies in the simulation snapshot are able to form regions , with the region size and the ionization fraction inside it increasing with @xmath22 ; this results in a @xmath57 which increases with @xmath132 . as the galaxies continue to form stars , the sizes of the regions built by each source increase with time , leading @xmath133 to decrease to @xmath134 at @xmath135 myr respectively .",
    "this leads to an increase in the transmission of the red part of the ly@xmath0 line for all the sources , in turn yielding a corresponding increase of the ly@xmath0 luminosity of each source , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ lya_novel_nodust ] .",
    "however , after about 200 myr , @xmath42 reduces to @xmath136 ; the regions built by each source are large enough so that almost all of the red part of the ly@xmath0 line is transmitted and the value of @xmath57 saturates for all laes .",
    "this results in very similar lfs for @xmath137 , as seen from the same figure .",
    "the key point here is that , if peculiar velocities and dust effects are neglected , at no stage of the reionization history , either the slope or the amplitude of the observed ly@xmath0 lf can be reproduced ; analogous problems arise also when the uv lfs are considered .",
    "the above discussion implies the need of one or more physical effects attenuating the ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , the most obvious of which is the presence of dust in the ism of these galaxies , which would absorb both ly@xmath0 and continuum photons , simultaneously reducing @xmath56 and @xmath53 .",
