    "more than 30 years ago @xcite the linear mixing rule for multicomponent strongly coupled mixtures was shown to be highly accurate . however , only recent studies @xcite have achieved enough accuracy to describe the corrections to the linear mixing rule for a wide range of plasma parameters ; previous attempts , e.g.  @xcite , were restricted at least by a limited number of data points . we discuss the corrections to the linear mixing rule in application to the plasma screening of nuclear reactions in strongly coupled mixtures .",

    "@xcite we apply two approaches to calculate the screening enhancement : one is based on the thermodynamic relations and the other on fitting the mean - field potentials .",
    "the main advance of the present work is in using a much wider set of numerical data and most precise thermodynamic results .",

    "let us also define the average charge number @xmath12 and mass number @xmath13 of the ions .",
    "the charge neutrality implies that the electron number density is @xmath14 .",
    "the electron plasma screening is typically weak and will be neglected .",
    "thermonuclear reactions in stars take place after the atomic nuclei collide and penetrate through the coulomb barrier . for a not too cold and dense stellar matter",
    "the tunneling length @xmath15 is much smaller than interionic distances ( for recent result of nuclear fusion with large tunneling distances see @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction of the reacting ions with neighboring plasma particles creates a potential well which enlarges the number of close encounters and enhances the reaction rate . before the tunneling event",
    "the reactants @xmath11 and @xmath2 behave as classical particles .",
    "their correlations can be described by the classical radial pair distribution function @xmath16 .",

    "we expect that the expansion of @xmath24 contains only even powers of @xmath30 ( the widom expansion , @xcite ) ; its quadratic term is known @xcite : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the ion - sphere radius of the compound nuclei .",

    "we use the well known approximation of @xmath46 suggested by potekhin & chabrier @xcite . in linear mixing model eq .",

    "our aim is to check the accuracy of the linear mixing and analyze deviations from this model . to do this",

    "for example , the simulation number 1 is done for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "each panel contains a set of dots with error bars , which represent the values of @xmath38 calculated by fitting @xmath24 with the aid of ( [ widom ] ) .",

    "( [ h0lin ] ) ; the long - dash line is calculated with the best available thermodynamics of the multicomponent plasma ( eq.([h0 ] ) with the free energy taken from @xcite ) ; the short - dash line is our approximation ( [ appr ] ) .",
    "note , that the normalized enhancement parameter is approximately constant at large @xmath60 .",
    "this property is well known @xcite . the linear mixing is a highly accurate as long as @xmath61 . for lower @xmath60",
    "the relative corrections can be much larger and well described by both dashed - lines ( the accurate thermodynamics and approximation ) .",
    "the most noticeable difference between dots and the short - dashed lines takes place for @xmath62 in simulations 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 that are done for low fractions of highly charged ions and large ratio @xmath63 .",
    "such a difference is unimportant for applications  it translates into the correction to the reaction rate within a factor of two .    also , there are three large @xmath64 simulations ( 96 , 97 , and 99 ) , where dots are divergent .",
    "they started with lattice configurations of ions .",
    "thus the corrections to the linear mixing in crystalline phase are larger ( as noted in @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest to use the following approximation for the enhancement factor for all @xmath64 and mixture composition @xmath65 .",

    "( [ appr ] ) reproduces the debye - hckel asymptote at low @xmath64 and the linear mixing at strong coupling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hvsg ] we show the dependence of the approximated enhancement factors @xmath69 on @xmath54 .",
    "the figure contains three panels ; each for a specific binary ionic mixture .",
    "each panel shows three groups of four lines .",
    "they are ( from top to bottom ) @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "two of any four lines ( solid and thick dashed lines ) are almost the same in the majority of cases .",
    "this couple represents the approximation ( [ appr ] ) and the thermodynamic enhancement factor ( [ h0 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines refer to the debye - hckel model and the dash - dot lines are the linear mixing results .",
    "one can see that our approximation is in a good agreement with thermodynamic results for most of cases , especially in panel ( a ) ( for all mixtures with not too large @xmath55 ) . if @xmath55 becomes too large [ panel ( c ) ] , the thermodynamic model of @xmath73 , calculated in accordance with @xcite , has a specific feature ( @xmath74 increases at @xmath75 ) , while our approximation has not .",
    "we expect that this feature is not real , but results from not too accurate extractions of the enhancement factors from thermodynamic data .",
    "the free energy is almost fully determined by larger charges @xmath76 which also dominate by number ( @xmath77 ) in panel ( c ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ h0 ] to get @xmath78 , one should differentiate the free energy with respect to @xmath79 , which provides vanishing contribution to the free energy .",
    "hence this procedure is very delicate and can strongly amplify the errors of original thermodynamic approximation .",
    "we expect that our approximation can be more accurate than the original thermodynamic result .",
    "another , less probable option is that we still have not enough data to prove the presence of the feature of @xmath80 .    to conclude , we have calculated the enhancement factors of nuclear reactions in binary ionic mixtures by two methods and showed good agreement of the results .",
    "we have proposed a simple approximation of the enhancement factors valid for any coulomb coupling .",
    "this approximation is almost the same as thermodynamic ones for not too specific mixtures .",
    "it does not confirm some questionable features of the enhancement factors for mixtures with large @xmath55 and small @xmath56 .",
