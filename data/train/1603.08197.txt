    "it was demonstrated that optical near - field effects can be utilised to augment surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) intensity when light is traveling from the substrate ( usually glass ) into air or solution from where analyte molecules can attach to nano - islands of gold or other plasmonic metal  @xcite .",
    "this sers excitation geometry is usually referred to as back - side whereas the standard retro - reflection setup with laser beam irradiating a substrate with metal nanoparticles from the air / solution side is the front - side .",
    "metal films nanometers in thickness deposited on different substrates have distinct formation morphologies defined by surface energy and deposition conditions .",
    "percolation of individual islands takes place to form a film when thickness is typically exceeds 10  nm .",
    "since back - side raman excitation can increase sers sensitivity by a factor of @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the refractive index of the substrate ( in reference to air or solution ) , it is of interest to explore properties of gold metal films at the percolation threshold , where interconnected metal islands produce the largest nano - groove openings .",
    "the possible polarisation effects on light transmission through a random pattern of nano - grooves , its coupling into surface plasmon polaritons , as well as plasmon localization effects are all very relevant for control of sers performance .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that patterns of nanoparticles forming a metamaterial which can support a traveling surface wave are better suited for sers  @xcite . also , randomness of a nanoparticle pattern in terms of their size and separation is advantageous for the spectrally broad - band performance and increased intensity in sers  @xcite .",
    "the percolation metal films studied here exhibit both randomness and surface interconnectivity .",
    "when @xmath6 waveplates are made out of dielectric layers deposited on a flat surface , it should be possible to achieve effective back - side irradiation field enhancement conditions using standard front - side illumination . for the @xmath6 waveplate the phase shift of @xmath7 occurs for light which experiences reflection and a double pass in the film . by engineering reflectivity of the substrate and waveplate material with deposited gold films",

    "for experimental investigation six different samples were produced using a thin film deposition machine vera 1100 ( vtd , germany ) .",

    "substrates where subsequently rinsed in ethanol , to remove thiophenol molecules not bound to au , and blow - dried with n@xmath11 .",
    "near - field enhancement effects were probed by performing raman spectra acquisitions , both , with laser incidence from the thin - film deposition side ( front - side ) and by focusing on the au layer through the @xmath45  mm - thick glass substrate ( back - side ) .",
    "for sers functionality nano - particles and nano - gaps are essential for light field enhancement at nanoscale - the generation of `` hot - spots '' .",
    "gold films at the percolation threshold have a random pattern of openings , hence , nano - gaps which can be used as hot - spots in sers .",
    "figure  [ f - trans](a ) shows a typical au film coated over a sio@xmath1 porous layer ( sample @xmath46_sio@xmath1 ) .",
    "this surface morphology corresponds to the local minimum in the transmission observed during deposition ( fig .",
    "[ f - trans](b ) ) and is also observed when tio@xmath1 and mgf@xmath1 underlying dielectric coatings are used .",
    "thickness of the gold film was 10 - 20  nm as could be estimated from sem images .",
    "gold was evaporated directly onto the porous or ctfs and was loosely attached to the substrate .",
    "a local transmission minimum occurs when transmission , @xmath47 , is approximately at a @xmath48-level ( for the normalised transmission ) .",
    "the refractive index of gold at @xmath49  nm is @xmath50 , hence , the transmission through a thickness of @xmath51  nm is @xmath52 . for longer gold deposition durations",
    "there is at first a slight increase in transmission , most probably due to an augmented forward scattering through the openings as result of fresnel reflection , before @xmath47 starts to continuously decrease once the openings are closed and the gold film grows in thickness .",
    "columnar coatings deposited at large glancing angles exhibit nanoscale surface roughness and by applying a thin au coating they were prepared for sers .",
    "polariscopy measurements were carried out to characterise the retardance of the coating with au film at the percolation threshold .",
    "figure  [ f - retar ] shows that an effective retardance measured in transmission was only 0.2 - 0.5% of the corresponding wavelength over the entire visible spectrum .",
    "this is a very small number and the porous and columnar films served only as nano - rough substrates for sers .",
    "it is noteworthy , that coatings corresponding to @xmath41 retardance would realise phase matching for constructive interference on the au surface ( inset in fig .",
    "[ f - retar ] ) and can be used to augment sers intensity ( planned as a next step of this study ) .",
    "the light reflected from the boundary ( inset in fig .",
    "[ f - retar ] ) can be considered as a back - side sers excitation component , since it is propagating from the high to the low refractive index region , hence , the fresnel enhancement takes place  @xcite .",
    "thickness of the coating , @xmath37 , was measured from sem cross sectional images and was @xmath53  nm , which defines the birefringence @xmath54 for the measured @xmath55 at @xmath56  nm used in sers .",
    "intriguingly , a very small birefringence was observed in the case of porous and vertical columnar structures ( fig .",
    "[ f - retar ] ) for which isotropic , hence non - birefringent , film performance is expected . however , film deposition is a complex process governed by local temperature and material delivery peculiarities , hence",
    ", local symmetry braking and anisotropy can be expected and related to the material flux .",
    "for example , surface of the vertical columnar film ( fig .",
    "[ f - intro](d ) ) clearly shows an anisotropy of nano - grain orientation on the top of the film .",
    "thicker dielectric films will be made for experimental measurements of birefringence and will be related to the cross sectional morphology and porosity in a following study .",
    "low sers signals were observed from thiophenol reporter molecule coated samples ( fig .",
    "[ f - sers ] ) .",
    "the back - side irradiation mode showed a strong fluorescence background ( fig .",
    "[ f - sers](a ) ) .",
    "the region - of - interest for thiophenol peaks on porous silica @xmath46_sio@xmath1 for the front- and back - side sers collection modes is shown in ( fig .",
    "[ f - sers](b ) ) .",
    "there was a recognisable difference between sers intensity for the two acquisition modes .",
    "the sers intensity is normalised only to the transmission through the microscope and a front - side reflection is not taken into account for the data shown in fig .",
    "[ f - sers ] for the back - side mode ( reflectivity of the air - surface is @xmath57 for intensity ) .",
    "a slightly larger sers signal by a factor of 1.2 - 1.6 was observed for the back - side irradiation .",
    "the reason of the enhancement is due to the local e - field amplitudes being different in the surface for the air - substrate and substrate - air cases  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of glass substrate for a back - side mode the amplitude of the transmitted light depends on the refractive index ratio between media of incidence and transmission ( @xmath58 vs @xmath59 ) as @xmath60 .",
    "since sers enhancement factor depends on the local e - field intensity at the wavelength of excitation and scattering - the electromagnetic enhancement factor , @xmath61 - one can expect an augmented sers intensity by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "the strongest back - side enhancement was observed for a silica porous film which has a slightly larger refractive index than porous mgf@xmath1 : for a solid film it would correspond to 1.4 vs 1.2 .",
    "interestingly , tilted column tio@xmath1 films ( deposition at 60 and 70 degrees ) showed almost identical sers intensity for both modes of excitation , most likely due to the negligible difference in retardance in both cases over the 300 nm thickness .",
    "however , for the ctf structures , there is a possibility to control the local light field intensity on the interface where sers is measured by the phase control through film thickness and exploiting the zero phase shift for light traversing form the higher to lower refractive index region ( @xmath63 ) . earlier studies showed that sers intensity is proportional to the thickness of gold  @xcite for measurements in reflection ( front - side mode ) .",
    "formation of hot - spots in sers occurs when 3d morphology of the surface develops in thicker gold films .",
    "if gold is coated over existing 3d nano - textured surfaces the hot - spots are formed in the crevices as demonstrated for well controlled 3d surface patterns  @xcite . in this regard",
    "the percolation nano - gaps are not as directly applicable for sers since they are mostly planar and formed on a flat substrate .",
    "sers is typically measured on 100-nm - thick au coatings and up to 6 - 8 fold decrease in sers intensity is expected on 16  nm gold films .",
    "sers intensity is also scales linearly with the solid collection angle and a low numerical aperture @xmath64 ( cone angle @xmath65 ) used in back - side sers measurements contributes to the lower signal  @xcite",
    ". the observed sers rate of 30  counts/(mw@xmath3s ) would be 3 times stronger for the popular @xmath66 ( cone angle @xmath67 ) acquisition mode .",
    "this shows that the layer system of nanostructured dielectric and thin gold films used in this study can perform at the level of @xmath68  counts/(mw@xmath3s ) for the commonly used @xmath66 lens which is typical for many reported sers substrates .",
    "further sers enhancement is achievable with formation of deep nano - grooves usually obtained on nano - rough substrates using thick ( @xmath69  nm ) metal coatings .",
    "it has been demonstrated that thin @xmath0  nm gold coatings at the percolation threshold can be used as sers substrates .",
    "re - scaled for acquisition with a typical @xmath66 objective lens , the sers intensity could reach @xmath68  counts/(mw@xmath3s ) , which is typical in the sers field .",
    "the presence of the back - side sers intensity augmentation is confirmed for percolation films for the first time .",
    "future work is required for fabricating sers substrates which are optimised for maximum e - field enhancement factors on the surface via the use of birefringent ctf @xmath41 plates and percolation coatings .",
    "phase control via the thickness of the phase plate could bring a new means of sers control  @xcite and can be implemented to improve the signal - to - noise ratio using sers signals from two different ctf regions .",
    "such control would inherently require a percolation property of films for light transmission .",
    "porosity and gas permeability of ctf could also find use in practical sers applications .",
