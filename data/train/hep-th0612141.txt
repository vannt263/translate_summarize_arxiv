    "a new theoretical concept which , once formulated , naturally emerges in many related contexts , deserves further study .",
    "even more so , if it makes us view well - established theories in a novel way , and meaningfully points beyond standard theory .",
    "area metrics , we argue in this paper , are such an emerging notion in fundamental physics .",
    "an area metric may be defined as a fourth rank tensor field which allows to assign a measure to two - dimensional tangent areas , in close analogy to the way a metric assigns a measure to tangent vectors . in more than three dimensions ,",
    "area metric geometry is a true generalization of metric geometry ; although every metric induces an area metric , not every area metric comes from an underlying metric .",
    "the mathematical constructions , and physical conclusions , of the present paper are then based on a single principle :    _ spacetime is an area metric manifold .",
    "_    we will be concerned with justifying this rather bold idea by a detailed construction of the geometry of area metric manifolds , followed by providing an appropriate theory of gravity , which finally culminates in an application of our ideas to cosmology . in the highly symmetric cosmological area metric spacetimes , we can compare our results easily to those of einstein gravity .",
    "we obtain the interesting result that the simplest type of area metric cosmology , namely a universe filled with non - interacting string matter , may be solved exactly and is able to explain the observed  @xcite very small late - time acceleration of our universe , see the figure on page , without introducing any notion of dark energy , nor by invoking fine - tuning arguments .",
    "it may come as a surprise , but standard physical theory itself predicts the departure from metric to true area metric manifolds .",
    "more precisely , the quantization of classical theories based on metric geometry generates , in a number of interesting cases , area metric geometries : back - reacting photons in quantum electrodynamics effectively propagate in an area metric background @xcite ; the massless states of quantum string theory give rise to the neveu - schwarz two - form potential and dilaton besides the graviton , producing a generalized geometry which may be neatly absorbed into an area metric @xcite ; the low energy action for d - branes @xcite is a true area metric volume integral @xcite ; canonical quantization of gravity  la ashtekar  @xcite naturally leads to an area operator  @xcite , such that the classical limit of the underlying spin network structure is also likely a generic area metric manifold , rather than a metric one .",
    "the emerging picture is that area metric manifolds are generalized geometries . in the case of string theory",
    ", one may even reverse the argument by observing that the geometry of an area metric background forces one to consider strings rather than point particles  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "this plays a role in our discussion of fluids in area cosmology ; fluids on area metric spacetime can not consist of particles , but must feature strings as the minimal mechanical objects , which leads us to develop the notion of a string fluid .",
    "generalized geometries begin to play an increasingly important role also in mainstream string theory , despite the fact that one initial starting point for its formulation is a metric target space manifold .",
    "non - geometric backgrounds in string theory , meaning backgrounds that do not admit a metric geometry , for instance emerge in flux compactifications on which one acts with t - dualities or in mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "they also appear in compactifications with duality twists , which in some cases have been shown to be equivalent to asymmetric orbifolds  @xcite .",
    "generalized geometries built to understand these situations have been originally proposed by hitchin @xcite and , the t - fold idea , by hull @xcite .",
    "these have found a number of applications  @xcite , one recent example discusses the stabilization of all moduli through fluxes in a specific non - geometric background  @xcite .",
    "maybe the most striking example of a classical theory , where area metrics play a natural role , is gauge theory in general , and maxwell electrodynamics in particular .",
    "given that electrodynamics is the historical birth place of the concept of a spacetime metric , this is certainly noteworthy .",
    "it is known that electrodynamics may be formulated on any @xmath0-dimensional smooth manifold without even introducing the concept of a metric @xcite .",
    "the idea of this so - called pre - metric approach goes back to a paper by peres @xcite , and is based on the observation that charges , and in certain situations , magnetic flux lines can be counted , which is nicely explained in @xcite .",
    "hence one may define the notions of a field strength two - form @xmath1 and an electromagnetic induction @xmath2-form @xmath3 .",
    "the equations of vacuum electrodynamics are then given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the induction two - tensor  @xmath6 dual to  @xmath3 must be related to the field strength @xmath1 by some constitutive relation in order to close the system of equations . while peres originally took this to be a definition of the metric , hehl et al .",
    "@xcite generalized this to an arbitrary linear relation @xmath7 described by a tensor @xmath8 of fourth rank , and investigated which conditions imply light propagation along a lorentzian lightcone .",
    "such general relations between the field strength and the induction are known from the description of electrodynamics in continuous media ; the lensing of light rays in some materials can not be described by geodesics in a metric background .",
    "it is therefore not too daring to suspect that gravitational lensing may be equally rich , which amounts to the assumption that spacetime is an area metric manifold  our central assumption in this paper .    of course",
    ", neither the most extensive list of known phenomena , nor the most suggestive hints for generalizations alone will be able to justify our proposal to consider spacetime an area metric manifold .",
    "however , the area metric gravity theory developed in this paper seems a particularly worthwile testbed for our hypothesis ; this is not least due to the fact that we do not introduce any new parameter into the theory . in this sense , it is not a deformation of einstein - hilbert gravity ( as every alternative action based on metric geometry necessarily is ) , but rather an extension in which the metric ricci scalar is replaced by its area metric analogue .",
    "the prediction of an accelerated expansion of our universe at late times , without any additional assumptions or scales being put in by hand , should count as a promising indication in favour of the idea of area metric spacetime .",
    "this paper is divided into two largely self - contained parts .",
    "part one ( sections 17 ) develops the foundations of area metric geometry in detail .",
    "its practical results , however , are concisely summarized in the first section of part two ( sections 8 - 14 ) where the area metric version of einstein - hilbert gravity is formulated in general , and then applied to area metric cosmology .",
    "a more detailed outline of the individual sections of the paper is given at the beginning of each of the two parts .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of our results and point out future directions .",
    "appendix  [ conventions ] lists our conventions , while appendices  [ appvary ] and  [ qsimplification ] respectively derive the general equations of motion of four - dimensional area metric gravity , and those simplified for the almost metric case .",
    "this first purely mathematical part of the paper may be skipped at first reading .",
    "its practically relevant results are concisely summarized at the beginning of part two , so that the reader mainly interested in the application of area metric geometry to gravity and cosmology may fast - forward to the second part , and come back later to the in - depth treatment of area metric geometry presented here .",
    "the precise definition of area metrics , densities and volume forms is given in section  [ manifolds ] , before the non - linear structure of the space of oriented areas is briefly discussed in section  [ sec_areabundles ] .",
    "the ensuing construction of area metric geometry is canonical in the sense that it does not rely on additional structure beyond area metric data @xcite . a central issue , namely the extraction of some effective metric from an area metric , is resolved in three steps : identification of the fresnel tensor associated with an area metric in section  [ gauge ] , construction of a family of pre - metrics from the fresnel tensor in section  [ normal ] , and finally selection of a unique , non - degenerate member of that family in section  [ sec_effmetric ] . the aside on area metric symmetries in section",
    "[ sec_killing ] prepares our discussion of cosmology later on . from a practical point of view",
    ", the most important result of this first part of the paper is the construction of area metric curvature tensors which are downward compatible to their metric counterparts , in section  [ curvature ] .",
    "knowing how to measure lengths and angles , one knows how to measure areas .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath9 is a metric manifold , one may define the tensor @xmath10 that measures the squared area of a parallelogram spanned by vectors @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "we will call @xmath13 the area metric induced from the metric @xmath14 .    the basic idea of area metric geometry",
    "consists in promoting area metrics to a structure in their own right , independent of whether there is some underlying metric or not . to achieve this generalization , we simply introduce the area metric by keeping some of the salient algebraic properties of the metric - induced area metrics ( [ cg ] ) .",
    "formally , we define an area metric manifold @xmath15 as a smooth @xmath0-dimensional manifold @xmath16 equipped with a fourth - rank covariant tensor field @xmath17 that satisfies the following symmetry and invertibility properties at each point of the manifold :    1 .",
    "@xmath18 for all vector fields @xmath19 in @xmath20 , 2 .",
    "@xmath21 for all vector fields @xmath19 in @xmath20 , 3 .",
    "@xmath22 , defined as @xmath23 by continuation , is invertible .",
    "here @xmath24 denotes the space of all contravariant antisymmetric tensors of rank two ; for our conventions concerning components of @xmath25 tensors see appendix [ conventions ] .",
    "we will see at the end of section [ gauge ] that in three dimensions every area metric is metric - induced ; from four dimensions onwards , however , there exist area metrics that can not be induced from any metric .",
    "in addition to the symmetries _ ( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ which we included in our definition , a metric - induced area metric ( [ cg ] ) features a third symmetry , namely cyclicity : @xmath26 we emphasize that we do not impose cyclicity as a property of generic area metrics .",
    "in fact , we will see shortly that non - cyclicity plays a central role in two related problems : in the extraction of metric information from an area metric and in the construction of area metric compatible connections .",
    "the price to pay for non - cylicity is that the area metric tensor @xmath17 is algebraically reducible .",
    "more precisely , any area metric decomposes uniquely into a cyclic area metric and a four - form , which are both irreducible .",
    "it will turn out to be advantageous for technical reasons to consider such a decomposition for the inverse area metric , @xmath27}\\,.\\ ] ] in this context note that the cyclic components @xmath28 and the four - form components @xmath1 of the inverse area metric generically mix under inversion ; in other words , the cyclic part of the inverse area metric is not simply the inverse of the cyclic part of the area metric .    an area metric @xmath17 naturally gives rise to the scalar density @xmath29 of weight @xmath30 , where the capitalized determinant @xmath31 is understood to be taken over the square matrix of dimension @xmath32 representing the map @xmath33 .",
    "the correct transformation behaviour under diffeomorphisms is easily seen by direct calculation , noting that for any square matrix @xmath34 of dimension @xmath0 we have @xmath35}{}_{b_2 } = ( \\det t^a{}_b)^{d-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where the determinant @xmath36 denotes the standard determinant .",
    "hence any area metric manifold is naturally equipped with a volume form @xmath37 , whose components in some basis are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the levi - civita tensor density normalized such that @xmath40 .",
    "now that we have given a precise definition of area metric manifolds , we should mention some relations to the mathematical literature .",
    "the idea to base geometry on some measure of area goes back to work by cartan @xcite , and has been generalized under the name of ` areal spaces ' , see @xcite and references therein , to geometries based on reparametrization - invariant integrals , i.e. , to any given volume measure .",
    "although these geometries are more general than our physically motivated area measure , this does not mean that we will simply reproduce , or specialize , known mathematics in this paper . in fact , it is precisely our tensorial approach that allows us , in a novel way , to construct an effective metric and connections on the embedding bundle of areas .",
    "moreover the physical motivation behind our construction leads to a successful application to gravity theory .",
    "at first sight , it seems that an area metric assigns a measure to parallelograms .",
    "but actually , an area metric @xmath17 assigns equal area measure to any two co - planar parallelograms @xmath11 and @xmath41 in @xmath42 that are related by an @xmath43 basis transformation . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 ; then @xmath47 the equivalence class of all parallelograms that are @xmath48-related to some representative parallelogram @xmath11 is algebraically neatly realized as the wedge product @xmath49 , since @xmath50 the quotient space of all parallelograms by this @xmath48 identification will be denoted by @xmath51 , and its elements are the oriented areas over @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , we denote the bundle of oriented areas over @xmath16 by @xmath53 .",
    "whereas parallelograms constitute a vector space @xmath54 , the oriented areas @xmath51 at some point @xmath55 can not carry a vector space structure . to see this",
    "note the following : while @xmath49 clearly is an element of the vector space @xmath24 , a generic vector @xmath56 decomposes into a finite sum of such wedge - products , rather than being a single wedge - product .",
    "a useful necessary and sufficient criterion for @xmath57 to be a simple wedge product , and hence an oriented area , is @xmath58 in which case @xmath57 is called simple .",
    "thus the space of oriented areas @xmath51 is a subset of the vector space @xmath24 defined by the vanishing of the four - tensor @xmath59 .",
    "since this condition is quadratic in @xmath57 , the set @xmath51 is recognized as an affine variety in @xmath24 .",
    "hence the bundle @xmath53 fails to be a vector bundle .",
    "while this does not prevent the construction of a connection , from some connection on the underlying principal bundle , it is not possible to define a covariant derivative on @xmath53 .",
    "but it is possible to define a covariant derivative on the vector bundle @xmath25 , into which @xmath53 is embedded , and we will do so in section [ curvature ] .    when discussing strings and string fluids in section [ sec_sfluids ] , we will also need to address integrability issues , i.e. , under which circumstances a distribution of oriented areas is tangent to some underlying two - surface .",
    "the physical postulate put forward in this paper is that physical spacetime is an area metric manifold @xmath15 , rather than a metric manifold .",
    "this immediately prompts the question of whether a generic area metric may give rise to some effective metric on the manifold  @xmath16 .",
    "the latter will play a significant role in the construction of an area metric curvature scalar which is downward compatible to the metric ricci scalar , in section [ curvature ] .    with the aim of constructing an effective metric in mind",
    ", it turns out to be extraordinarily instructive to probe the geometric structure of an area metric manifold by abelian gauge theory . in particular",
    "this allows us to study wave propagation , which in the geometric - optical limit gives insight into the geometry of rays . in the metric - induced case ,",
    "the ray surfaces reduce to the familiar null cones . in our more general",
    "setting , the fresnel tensor describes the geometry of rays , and its derivation presents the first step towards the extraction of metric information from the underlying area metric manifold , which will be completed in sections [ normal ] and [ sec_effmetric ] .",
    "consider the following action for a one - form potential @xmath60 with field strength @xmath61 on an area metric manifold of dimension @xmath62 : @xmath63 the equations of motion , derived by variation with respect to @xmath60 , are simply given by the bianchi identity @xmath4 and by @xmath5 in terms of the dual electromagnetic induction  @xmath3 , which is a @xmath2-form on @xmath16 with components @xmath64    to obtain geometric information from these equations , we study the geometric - optical limit . in this limit",
    "one considers waves as propagating discontinuities in the derivatives of the fields @xmath1 and of the electromagnetic induction @xmath2-form @xmath3 along a wavefront surface described by the level lines of some scalar function @xmath65 on @xmath16 .",
    "the rays of the wavefront are then given by the gradient @xmath66 .",
    "extending an insightful argument of hehl , obukhov and rubilar @xcite , where a detailed derivation may be found , to arbitrary dimension @xmath0 , we find that the wavefront gradients must obey the fresnel equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the totally symmetric tensor density of weight @xmath69 given by @xmath70 with @xmath28 being the cyclic part of the inverse area metric @xmath71 as in ( [ c+f ] ) . as explained in appendix [ conventions ] we use the convention that the summation over numbered _",
    "anti_-symmetric indices is ordered , i.e. , @xmath72 and similarly for the @xmath73 .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that , in the geometric - optical limit , the propagation of wave fronts is determined entirely in terms of the cyclic part of the inverse area metric , due to ( [ dense ] )",
    ". it will be convenient to cast the information encoded in the density @xmath68 into the form of a tensor @xmath74 . in order to not introduce non - cyclic information into this tensor",
    ", we are led to de - densitize @xmath68 according to @xmath75 note that the determinant factor presents the required scalar density of weight @xmath76 because  @xmath28 is a contravariant tensor .",
    "the tensor @xmath74 describing the ray surfaces will be called the fresnel tensor induced from the area metric @xmath17 .    in order to illustrate the geometric role of the fresnel tensor @xmath74 in a familiar setting , consider the action ( [ edaction ] ) on a lorentzian manifold @xmath9 , on which , for the time being , the area measure is simply induced from the metric @xmath14 by virtue of ( [ cg ] ) .",
    "a more subtle discussion of metric - induced measures will follow in section [ sec_effmetric ] . in this case",
    "the action reduces to the standard form @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , a direct calculation shows that the fresnel tensor simplifies to @xmath78 so that the fresnel equation ( [ fresnel ] ) takes the factorized form @xmath79 this result is of course equivalent to the standard null condition for light rays propagating on a metric manifold .",
    "the insight to be drawn from this comparison is the fact that , a priori , it is not a metric that describes the propagation of rays ( not even in the metric case ) , but rather the fresnel tensor @xmath74 ( which however happens to factorize neatly to the form ( [ factoredfresnel ] ) in the case of a metric background ) .",
    "hence , it is useful to make a conceptual difference between the background structure ( metric or area metric ) employed to define one - form dynamics on the one hand , and the structure that describes that theory in the geometric - optical limit ( the fresnel tensor ) on the other hand , although we are used to think of these structures as synonymous in the metric case .",
    "there is an important corollary from the above findings , of which we will make essential use in section [ sec_killing ] . for an area metric in three dimensions ,",
    "the ( totally symmetric ) fresnel tensor @xmath80 is of second rank , and with some amount of algebra , one checks that @xmath80 is invertible .",
    "furthermore , @xmath81 induces the area metric we started with , by expression ( [ cg ] ) .",
    "hence , in three dimensions , every area metric is induced from some metric .",
    "this is no longer the case in more than three dimensions .",
    "as a second step towards the extraction of an effective metric from the area metric , we identify in this section a family @xmath82 of pre - metrics on  @xmath16 which are induced by an area metric via the fresnel tensor .",
    "if the area metric data distinguish a non - degenerate member of that family ( in a way we will explain below ) , the area metric manifold will be called normal . in other words ,",
    "normal area metrics allow for the extraction of a metric .",
    "probing an area metric manifold of arbitrary dimension by abelian gauge theory , we found that wave propagation in the geometric - optical limit is described by the fresnel tensor ( [ fresnel ] ) , not by a metric .",
    "we may use the totally symmetric fresnel tensor to define a symmetric bilinear form on a subbundle of the cotangent bundle @xmath83 ( with bundle projection @xmath84 ) by the following construction , which in similar form finds application in finslerian geometry @xcite .",
    "we choose local coordinates @xmath85 on @xmath86 which induce local coordinates @xmath87 on @xmath88 , by virtue of @xmath89 .",
    "then we define the characteristic function @xmath90 on that portion @xmath91 of the cotangent bundle where @xmath92 takes real values .",
    "thus @xmath93 is a level set of the function on the total bundle space defined by the imaginary part of @xmath92 , and hence defines a subbundle of @xmath83 , with @xmath94 . for any @xmath95 ,",
    "the function @xmath96 is homogeneous of degree two in @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 . from the characteristic function",
    "we may now define a symmetric tensor field @xmath99 by differentiating  @xmath92 twice with respect to the fibre coordinate @xmath100 this is indeed a tensor under diffeomorphisms of @xmath16 since they do not depend on the fibre coordinates @xmath97 .",
    "it is quickly verified that @xmath101 so that the bilinear form @xmath92 only depends on the direction of  @xmath97 in the fibre , not on its ` length ' .",
    "this scaling behaviour of @xmath99 is consistent with the scaling of the characteristic function @xmath92 .",
    "a simple and fruitful way of looking at this construction is to think of an area metric as giving rise to a family @xmath82 of symmetric contravariant tensors on @xmath16 with components @xmath102 parametrized by sections @xmath103 .",
    "viewing the characteristic function @xmath92 as a generalized norm squared on cotangent vectors @xmath97 , the symmetric covariant tensors @xmath82 present linearizations of this norm around the chosen section @xmath104 .",
    "we emphasize again the fact that only the cyclic part @xmath28 of the inverse area metric @xmath71 contributed to the fresnel tensor @xmath74 , and hence to the construction of the symmetric tensors @xmath105 .    an important class of area metric manifolds are those for which one may construct a particular section @xmath106 alone from the data of the area metric tensor @xmath17",
    ", such that  @xmath107 is non - degenerate on all of @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath108 will be called a normal area metric manifold .",
    "we will see that normality of an area metric is an inevitable requirement for the construction of area metric curvature tensors that are downward compatible to their metric counterparts .",
    "but it is not a big restriction .",
    "we will show in the next section that one - forms @xmath104 can always be constructed from the area metric , albeit not always uniquely .",
    "also , @xmath109 is an open condition so that normality is the rule not the exception . in particular",
    ", we will show that area metrics induced from riemannian metrics are always normal . for lorentzian metrics in even dimensions , we find that the construction of a normal area metric interestingly requires that the lorentzian metric should describe a stably causal spacetime .",
    "the signature of a normal area metric manifold @xmath108 is defined as the signature @xmath110 of the metric @xmath111 constructed from @xmath17 and @xmath112 . with this definition , we may define the totally antisymmetric tensor density @xmath113 to be normalized such that @xmath114 .",
    "this in turn induces the contravariant tensor @xmath115 with components @xmath116 it is necessary to distinguish the tensors @xmath117 and @xmath115 , because their components are in general not related by lowering and raising of indices with the area metric and inverse area metric , respectively . with these definitions , we obtain for the contraction over @xmath118 indices the useful identity @xmath119}_{\\,\\,\\,b_1 \\dots b_{d - k}}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "we now complete the construction of an effective metric from a generic area metric manifold @xmath15 without specifying additional data . from our findings in sections  [ gauge ] and  [ normal ] , we know that the extraction of a metric from area metric data amounts to the construction of a section @xmath104 of the subbundle @xmath91 , as defined by reality of the characteristic function  ( [ character ] ) , such that  @xmath120 is normal",
    ". then the inverse of the tensor  @xmath82 as defined in  ( [ hsigma1 ] ) provides the desired metric . in order to achieve downward compatibility with metric geometry",
    ", we further require that for metric - induced area metrics the inducing metric  @xmath14 is recovered up to a sign ( more can not be expected since the metric - induced area metrics are quadratic expressions ) .",
    "this requirement will lead to a modification of the induction formula  ( [ cg ] ) for lorentzian metrics .",
    "the fresnel tensor for a metric - induced area metric ( [ cg ] ) takes the simple form ( [ metricfresnel ] ) .",
    "then the characteristic function ( [ character ] ) is given by @xmath121 in both cases this is real on the entire cotangent bundle , so that @xmath122 .",
    "now , however , appears a crucial difference between metric manifolds of different signatures .",
    "first consider the case of a riemannian metric @xmath14 where @xmath123 independent of the dimension . in this case",
    "all members of the family @xmath105 of metrics coincide , and are given , for an arbitrary section @xmath104 , by @xmath124 this means that any choice of section @xmath125 recovers the inducing riemannian metric @xmath14 from the area metric @xmath126 , including the zero section that does not even require area metric data .",
    "thus @xmath127 is normal if @xmath14 is a riemannian metric .",
    "the same conclusion holds if @xmath14 is an odd - dimensional lorentzian metric . but now let @xmath14 be an even - dimensional lorentzian metric",
    ". then the family @xmath82 of metrics is given by @xmath128 in contrast to the riemannian case , it is now not possible to choose the zero - section in order to recover the inducing lorentzian metric .",
    "this means we must obtain a non - trivial section from the area metric in order to be downwards compatible to the metric - induced case .",
    "otherwise the construction would fail for the even - dimensional lorentzian case .",
    "we first observe that the required section @xmath104 can not be constructed alone from the cyclic part @xmath28 of the inverse area metric .",
    "this is because the only one - forms obtainable from @xmath28 are of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are a finite set of non - negative integers and @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "now for an area metric that is metric - induced according to  ( [ cg ] ) , we have @xmath134 and @xmath135 , so that both @xmath28 and its inverse are cylic ( which , we recall , does not hold for generic area metrics ) . then it is easily verified that all of the one - forms  ( [ candidateone ] ) vanish .",
    "thus we are compelled to conclude that information from the area metric beyond the cyclic part  @xmath28 is needed for the definition of a non - trivial section  @xmath104 .",
    "we hence turn to the four - form part of the inverse area metric as a potential carrier of this information .",
    "this fits nicely together with the observation that  @xmath136 is defined entirely in terms of the cyclic part of the inverse area metric .",
    "so the four - form part will exclusively contribute to the construction of the section  @xmath104 which replaces  @xmath97 , while the cyclic part exclusively contributes to the definition of the bilinear symmetric tensor  @xmath136 .",
    "for an area metric manifold of dimension @xmath137 , we may schematically decompose the inverse area metric as @xmath138 so that the information in the four - form part is succinctly encoded in a @xmath139-form @xmath140 .",
    "now four - dimensional area metric manifolds are distinguished since , in this dimension , the construction of a one - form from the four - form part of @xmath71 is unique .",
    "the only possible choice is @xmath141 any rescaling of this choice , even by a function , is without effect because of relation ( [ deg0 ] ) . due to the symmetries of @xmath71 and @xmath115 , it is also not possible to construct further non - vanishing one - forms from @xmath142 .",
    "already in five dimensions , there are several possibilities , @xmath143 in even higher dimensions , the number of possibilities further proliferates .",
    "so in four dimensions only may one speak of _ the _ normal area metric manifold @xmath120 constructed from an area metric manifold .",
    "( at least , unless one could formulate further meaningful criteria to construct , also in higher dimensions , a natural section @xmath112 to single out the effective metric from the family @xmath82 of contravariant tensors . ) from now on , we will therefore restrict attention to the four - dimensional case , which of course also is the one of immediate physical interest .",
    "a four - dimensional normal area metric manifold will henceforth be denoted @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the unique metric constructed from the area metric  @xmath17 .",
    "generically , the metric @xmath146 of course only encodes part of the information contained in the area metric .",
    "other than in dimension three , the area measure @xmath147 re - induced from the effective metric generically does not agree with the measure determined by  @xmath17 .",
    "the above constructions play out nicely for area metric manifolds induced by stably causal spacetimes @xmath9 in four dimensions . for the latter",
    ", there always exists a global time function @xmath148 on @xmath16 such that @xmath142 is everywhere @xmath14-timelike @xcite .",

    "thus the results of the present section will be useful in our discussion of area metric cosmology in the following sections  [ pfluids][sec_exact ] .",
    "the main aim here , however , is to study the conditions under which area metric gravity reduces to einstein gravity .    in doing so",
    ", it is important to withstand the temptation to discuss the reduction of ( [ totalaction ] ) to the almost metric case at the level of the action",
    ". this can not be meaningful a priori , because variation with respect to @xmath17 sweeps out more variations than variations with respect to a metric and a scalar field can do @xcite .",
    "if one simply inserted the ansatz @xmath291 into the total action , this would reduce the gravitational part to its standard metric analogue , up to a @xmath148-dependent conformal factor .",
    "but we will now show that this does not correspond to what generically happens at the level of the full equations of motion including matter .",
    "so we insert the almost metric form @xmath291 into the full equations of motion , which , as shown in technical detail in appendix [ qsimplification ] , neatly factorizes the cyclic contribution  @xmath280 of the gravitational variation as @xmath292b ] } + s_{[c[a}g_{b]d]}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some symmetric tensor @xmath293 . if the cyclic contribution @xmath281 of the energy - momentum tensor to the equations of motion is generated in like fashion from some symmetric second rank tensor , then the field equations are equivalent to    [ vacuumgg ] @xmath294    where we define @xmath295 , @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "when we discuss cosmological solutions below , we will have to make sure that @xmath298 does not leave its allowed range @xmath299 we will see that this can be understood as a consistency constraint on the initial conditions .",
    "it is thus clear that for there to be an almost metric solution at all , the cyclic part of the energy - momentum tensor at hand needs to factorize in the same fashion as ( [ factorized ] ) .    in vacuo",
    ", this is of course trivially the case .",
    "it is also reassuring that the vacuum system with @xmath300 is causally well - behaved : in order to see this , we will now perform suitable field redefinitions , and thus reveal that this system is conformally equivalent to einstein - hilbert gravity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field .",
    "first , using the trace of the first equation we may replace the system by a simpler one :    @xmath301    now a conformal transformation of the metric and a simple redefinition of the scalar field according to @xmath302 shows that the vacuum equations of motion for an area metric of the almost metric form @xmath291 are conformally equivalent to the system @xmath303 these are precisely einstein s equations for @xmath304 coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath305 , and thus we know that also the original , conformally related theory is causal .",
    "we emphasize again that the above equations are only valid for almost metric area metrics in vacuo .",
    "this very special case , however , allows for a most important conclusion : any vacuum solution @xmath9 of einstein - hilbert gravity is a vacuum solution of area metric gravity ( setting either @xmath306 , or  @xmath307 with appropriate conditions on the derivatives , see ( [ vacuumgg ] ) ) .    upon the inclusion of matter however , it is no longer true that metric solutions of einstein - hilbert gravity lift to solutions of area metric gravity .",
    "for instance , the area metric energy - momentum tensor ( [ edt ] ) for electrodynamics does not take the factorized form ( [ factorized ] ) for the almost metric ansatz @xmath291 , simply because the first term does not even contain a metric .",
    "thus , not only can electrodynamics live on a non - metric area metric spacetime , but also in general electrodynamics backreacts in such a way as to generate a non - metric area metric spacetime !",
    "this can only be avoided by restricting the admissible geometries ( and thus the variation ) to a standard metric one . in other words , while standard einstein - hilbert solutions are of course stationary points of the einstein - hilbert action , they may fail to be stationary within the wider spectrum of area metric manifolds , in the presence of matter whose energy momentum tensor does not factorize .",
    "thus it is the fact that we vary with respect to the area metric which causes the potential departure from einstein - hilbert gravity in the presence of matter , while the vacuum solutions of standard general relativity are also vacuum solutions of area metric gravity .",
    "in general relativity perfect fluids present an effective device to discuss the gravitational effects of fundamental matter averaged over large scales . especially in order to obtain calculationally manageable cosmological models ,",
    "the description of matter as an ubiquitous fluid is necessary . in this section",
    "we will introduce fluid matter on area metric spacetimes as the most general form of energy momentum consistent with area metric cosmology .",
    "this discussion paves our way towards a first comparison between area metric cosmology and einstein cosmology .",
    "the general form of the energy momentum four - tensor is restricted by the killing symmetries of a given area metric spacetime @xmath15 .",
    "consider a diffeomorphism of @xmath16 generated by a vector field @xmath269 , and the resulting change @xmath308 of the variation of the gravitational action with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "there are two ways to express this quantity .",
    "the first simply is the lie derivative of the four - tensor @xmath284 along @xmath269 , i.e. , @xmath309 .",
    "the second uses the fact that @xmath284 is completely determined by the area metric @xmath17 ; schematically it follows that @xmath310 .",
    "hence if @xmath157 is a killing symmetry of @xmath17 , i.e. , if @xmath311 , then we conclude @xmath312 the general form of the area metric gravity equations of motion , including matter , is @xmath313 the lie derivative of the left hand side along any killing symmetry @xmath157 of the area metric @xmath17 vanishes , hence consistency requires that the energy momentum tensor should also satisfy @xmath314 for each of the background s killing symmetries .",
    "in other words , consistent energy momentum tensors inherit the symmetries of the background .",
    "this conclusion is analogous to the one used in standard general relativity to restrict the class of admitted sources in a spacetime with specified symmetry properties .",
    "we may repeat our discussion of section [ sec_killing ] to impose the symmetries of an flrw area metric cosmology on the four - tensor @xmath34 . recall that @xmath71 is defined in terms of the standard flrw metric @xmath14 and a time - dependent scalar @xmath148 , and that we have a distinguished time variable @xmath315 .",

    "first note that like in the metric case , the fluid energy momentum tensor is not obtained from some lagrangian , and so the conservation law ( [ conservation ] ) is not automatically ensured .",
    "we have to impose the energy - momentum conservation condition on the tensor @xmath34 , which , using the hubble function @xmath318 , leads to the equation of motion of the fluid , @xmath319    before we turn to our main application of fluid matter , which will be to area metric cosmology , we will introduce in the next section the notion of string fluids which allows us to give a covariant interpretation to fluid matter on area metric spacetimes .",
    "area metric spacetimes @xmath15 do not provide a measure of length which would be required to formulate dynamics for the worldlines of point particles .",
    "but they do provide a measure of area , and so one may regard string worldsheets as the minimal dynamical , and hence fundamental , objects on area metric manifolds @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that any collection of matter fields averaged over large scales should have an approximate description in terms of a fluid made out of strings ; this is in complete analogy to standard general relativity where perfect ( point particle ) fluids are used for this purpose .",
    "our aim in this section is twofold : first we will formulate a simple energy momentum four - tensor for a string fluid on an arbitrary area metric spacetime , and give a geometric interpretation for the consistency conditions arising from the energy conservation equation  ( [ conservation ] ) .",
    "second , we will rewrite the general energy momentum tensor consistent with area metric cosmology covariantly in terms of a string fluid ; any collection of averaged matter fields in cosmology can thus be understood as a continuous distribution of string worldsheets .",
    "we recall a few basic facts about classical strings on @xmath15 from @xcite .",
    "string worldsheets are tangent surfaces to an integrable distribution of areas @xmath320 in @xmath53 .",
    "thus they satisfy the simplicity condtion  ( [ simple ] ) and the frobenius integrability criterion : the commutator of @xmath321 and @xmath322 lies within the plane spanned by @xmath323 . in components",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath324}=0\\,.\\ ] ] string dynamics follow from the stationarity of the worldsheet area integral , i.e. , from @xmath325 .",
    "the equality follows from the simplicity of @xmath57 , if we explicitly decompose the area metric as @xmath326 into the cyclic algebraic curvature tensor @xmath327 and a four form @xmath328 in analogy to ( [ c+f ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the string equation of motion takes a very simple form after fixing the worldsheet reparametrization invariance to constant squared area @xmath329 .",
    "the stationarity , or minimal surface , condition then simply becomes @xmath330(\\omega\\wedge z)=0\\ ] ] for any vector @xmath220 .",
    "only the cyclic part of the area metric contributes to this equation .",
    "the energy momentum four - tensor of a string fluid should be expressible in terms of the area metric and the area distribution @xmath57 .",
    "we now write down the simplest two terms that obey the required symmetries of an area metric .",
    "one of these will then be shown to represent fluids composed of non - interacting strings ; the other term is an example for a simple interaction .",
    "define @xmath331 in terms of two functions @xmath332 and @xmath333 . in order to demonstrate the geometric meaning of these terms we analyse the energy momentum conservation condition . as argued in the preceding section",
    "this condition is not automatically satisfied , but nevertheless has to be imposed for consistent matter coupling .",
    "we substitute ( [ sfluid ] ) into ( [ conservation ] ) ; the resulting equation can be rewritten as follows : @xmath334ab}\\omega^{ab}\\right ) -4 g_{diab}\\omega^{ab}\\left(\\nabla^{lc}_c+\\frac{1}{6}x_c\\right)\\left((\\tilde\\rho+\\tilde p ) \\omega^{cd}\\right)+8\\partial_i\\tilde p\\\\\\ ] ] observe that the totally antisymmetric part of the area metric in the first term does not contribute .",
    "this is a consequence of the simplicity ( [ simple ] ) and the integrability ( [ integrability ] ) of @xmath57 .",
    "hence we may replace @xmath17 in the first term by its cyclic part @xmath327 .",
    "due to the antisymmetrization in this term we may also replace the covariant derivatives by partials .",
    "let us discuss the case @xmath335 first .",
    "the first term then is recognizable as the stationarity condition ( [ stationarity ] ) : the local string worlsheets in the string fluid are stationary , as is classical string motion .",
    "the vanishing of the remaining second term in the string fluid conservation equation is implied by a generalized continuity equation @xmath336 where the right hand side represents the divergence of a densitized current . in form - language",
    "the continuity equation is equivalent to @xmath337=0 $ ] for the two - form @xmath338 .",
    "the geometrical picture for this equation is as follows .",
    "choose any compact four - volume  @xmath339 with boundary @xmath340 , and any hypersurface defined by @xmath341 with gradient @xmath342 .",
    "the projection on the hypersurface of the flow of the string fluid through @xmath343 is @xmath344\\wedge d\\psi\\,.\\ ] ] this vanishes if the volume @xmath339 lies entirely within the domain of the string fluid ; then its inflow and outflow through the boundary @xmath340 are precisely equal , independent of the choice of projection on @xmath342 .",
    "thus the string fluid energy momentum tensor ( [ sfluid ] ) is amenable to a simple analysis for  @xmath335 : energy momentum conservation is valid provided that the string fluid obeys both the stationarity equation and a generalized current conservation , or continuity , equation . while the worldsheet minimal surfaces of this situation correspond to zero mean curvature form @xmath345 , switching on a non - constant pressure @xmath346 means prescribing the local mean curvature by the projection of the gradient field @xmath347 into the surfaces",
    "non - zero  @xmath333 ( even a constant one ) also deforms the continuity equation .",
    "the term proportional to  @xmath333 hence represents a certain class of interactions between the strings that form the string fluid .",
    "finally , we remark that constant @xmath348 ( with @xmath349 ) generates precisely the same terms that one would obtain by adding an area metric cosmological constant to the gravitational action @xmath350 , in perfect analogy with the metric case .",
    "we now approach our second aim , and part , of this section : the covariant rewriting of the most general energy momentum tensor consistent with area metric cosmology , see the preceding section , in terms of a string fluid .",
    "recall that area metric cosmologies are of the almost metric type , featuring the flrw metric @xmath14 and an additional time - dependent scalar @xmath148 .",
    "string fluid matter in cosmology is tightly constrained ; consistency with isotropy forbids a one - component string fluid , since the local string worldsheets then would distinguish a preferred spatial direction .",
    "we therefore must resort to a string fluid with three components @xmath351 , with three @xmath14-spacelike vectors  @xmath352 that may isotropically fill out the spatial sections in a four - dimensional cosmology . due to the distinguished cosmological time variable , @xmath315 , the fluid energy momentum tensor ( [ fluidenergy ] ) has components proportional to the @xmath353 , @xmath354 and @xmath355 projections of the area metric , respectively .",
    "these can be defined covariantly using the three - component string fluid .    using the decomposition ( [ gdec ] )",
    "we first define a projection ( which is an endomorphism on  @xmath25 ) to the purely spatial indices  @xmath356 $ ] by writing @xmath357}_{cd}+q^{ab}{}_{cd}\\,,\\qquad",

    "we solve this by considering @xmath360 and @xmath361 vielbeins of the three - dimensional metric @xmath362 : then we have the useful relation @xmath363 . the second projection we need",
    "is the one to the mixed indices @xmath364 $ ] .",
    "it is simply given by the right - action of @xmath365 for which of course @xmath366 .",
    "there is one further way to covariantize the purely spatial components  @xmath367 of the area metric .",
    "consider the operator @xmath368 since the @xmath369 all contain the preferred time vector @xmath370 , we have @xmath371 , and hence @xmath372 .",
    "so @xmath373 is not a projection ; it rather maps tensors with mixed indices @xmath364 $ ] to tensors with purely spatial indices .",
    "in terms of the three - component string fluid we hence rewrite the fluid energy momentum as a sum of projections of the area metric to its different components , weighted each by time - dependent functions : @xmath374.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we do not display two further non - vanishing terms involving @xmath375 and @xmath376 since they simply result in shifts of the functions @xmath377 and @xmath378 . making use of the schematic relation @xmath379=-g^4(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ ] which follows from the fact that we have chosen the @xmath380 as vielbeins of @xmath362 , we may rewrite the energy momentum tensor as @xmath381 note that we have four functions @xmath382 here , although three functions @xmath383 as in ( [ fluidenergy ] ) should be sufficient . without loss of generality we can in fact fix @xmath384 .",
    "if we do so , and calculate the components @xmath385 , @xmath386 and @xmath387 , comparison to ( [ fluidenergy ] ) gives the invertible relation @xmath388    to conclude , the three - component string fluid tensor with @xmath384 is a covariant way to rewrite the general source tensor for all types of matter averaged over large scales in an area metric cosmology as @xmath389 the energy momentum conservation equation follows from ( [ fleq ] ) and ( [ invrel ] ) , using for later convenience the redefinition @xmath390 , and the hubble function , as @xmath391    a special case of the general expression ( [ gensfluid ] ) is the string fluid representing the sum of three components of non - interacting strings , see ( [ sfluid ] ) , which we will call string dust . from our previous discussion we read off the characteristic relations @xmath392 we will use string dust in our discussion of the late universe , where interactions presumably are neglibible .",
    "as a first application of the dynamical area metric manifold theory developed so far , we derive in this section the equations of area metric cosmology , with the aim to compare our theory to einstein s general relativity .    from our discussion of killing symmetries we know that cosmological area metrics are of the almost metric type , fully characterized by just two fields : the flrw metric @xmath14 and a time - dependent scalar field @xmath148 . thus we can use the simplified equations of motion  ( [ vacuumgg ] ) discussed in section [ solar ] .",
    "these are of the general form @xmath393 we perform a time space split by writing @xmath315 , where greek indices denote spatial coordinates .",
    "the characteristic property of the flrw metric , which obeys @xmath394 , also implies @xmath395 . employing the definition @xmath396 , and similarly for the spatial components of the cosmological ricci tensor , @xmath397",

    "the expression for  @xmath282 is given by equation ( [ phiva ] ) .",
    "we now consider the matter contribution to the gravitational equations of motion .",
    "as argued above the most general form of matter in area metric cosmology is given by a string fluid energy momentum tensor of the form ( [ gensfluid ] ) . from the timelike normalizations",
    "@xmath401 we immediately find the string fluid contribution to the scalar equation which simply reads @xmath402 the four - tensor contribution @xmath403 is more involved . since @xmath404 here , this projection to an algebraic curvature tensor is @xmath405 where the indices on @xmath369 are lowered with the metric @xmath14 .",
    "importantly there are no non - vanishing components @xmath406 .",
    "this is guaranteed by our construction and again shows consistency with the area metric cosmology background .",
    "we proceed to calculate the non - vanishing components of @xmath281 , which again uses the convenient form of the @xmath407 as vielbeins of @xmath362 .",
    "the results are @xmath408 it is easy to see that @xmath281 is induced by a symmetric two - tensor in the same way as is  @xmath280 in  ( [ factorized ] ) .",
    "we now extract the components of @xmath296 ; writing @xmath409 this gives @xmath410 according to ( [ eqform ] ) , we finally combine our results for the gravitational contributions ( [ eqgrav ] ) and our results for the matter contributions ( [ eqmatt ] ) to the general equations of area metric cosmology coupled to any type of matter . the latter is described in a parametrization by a three - component string fluid .",
    "we find the simple @xmath148-equation @xmath411 calculating the trace of @xmath412 and using ( [ req ] ) , we deduce a standard scalar field equation for @xmath298 , @xmath413 with potential @xmath414    finally , using both ( [ req ] ) and ( [ phieq ] ) to simplify ( [ eqform ] ) , we explicitly obtain the time - time and spatial components of the ricci tensor    [ graveqs ] @xmath415    we may now easily compare our equations to those of einstein gravity , i.e. , to @xmath416 , coupled to a perfect fluid with standard energy momentum @xmath417 . performing",
    "the time space split these equations are @xmath418 thus our string fluid gives rise to a perfect fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath419    before we analyze this effective behaviour further we have to perform a final consistency check .",
    "since the string fluid energy momentum four - tensor was not derived , by variation with respect to the inverse area metric , from an action , we have to ensure that the energy momentum conservation equation ( [ constring ] ) is satisfied .",
    "only then is the coupling of the string fluid to the gravitational equations consistent . to see why this is true , we start from the time - component of the contracted bianchi identity @xmath420 which is the standard fluid equation of motion @xmath421 . in our string fluid variables",
    "we thus have @xmath422 we expand the derivative of the term @xmath423 ; then we replace @xmath424 by using the identity @xmath425 which holds for any flrw cosmology , and @xmath426 by employing the equation of motion of @xmath298 .",
    "up to a sign , this precisely yields the energy momentum conservation condition ( [ constring ] ) .",
    "our cosmological three - component string fluid thus is consistent without any further restrictions on the functions @xmath427 and @xmath377 .",
    "let us turn to a closer inspection of the effective equation of state parameter @xmath428 .",
    "we obtain the following results which are generic for any string fluid , and thus for any type of matter in area metric cosmology ( in string fluid parametrization ) . in the limit @xmath429",
    "we obtain the parameter @xmath430 of an effective radiation fluid .",
    "note that this limit is exactly realized by the vacuum which , in particular , obeys @xmath431 .",
    "thus the vacuum cosmology in area metric geometry is equivalent to einstein cosmology filled with a radiation fluid .    in the limit @xmath432",
    "we obtain the parameter @xmath433 describing a universe with zero acceleration @xmath434 .",
    "consider now the condition @xmath435 for an accelerating universe ; it is satisfied if either @xmath436 or @xmath437 . for values of @xmath438 close to the simple pole in @xmath428 at @xmath439 , we may obtain any value of @xmath428 , both positive or negative .",
    "so string fluids in principle should be able to describe any physical universe .",
    "moreover , the diverging effective equation of state parameter @xmath440 close to the pole is a temptation to speculate on a possible explanation for the inflationary phase of the universe .",
    "whether this can be realized , however , requires a careful analysis and solutions of the equations .    in the next section",
    "we will explicitly analyze the important case of the late universe , which is characterized by non - interacting matter .",
    "we will show that area metric cosmology provides a natural explanation for the observed acceleration of our universe .",
    "in this section we exactly solve the equations of area metric cosmology filled with non - interacting matter , which we describe by string dust .",
    "this is the simplest scenario to which we can apply our theory .",
    "moreover , it should describe the late universe , where matter on average has spread out so much that interactions are no longer important .",
    "the defining relations for string dust have been discussed in ( [ sdust ] ) .",
    "we employ these and collect the complete set of equations of motion .",
    "the scalar equation of motion follows from  ( [ potphi ] ) as @xmath441 we also have the gravitational equations ( [ graveqs ] ) which , in the string dust case , read    [ gequ ] @xmath442    in the non - vacuum case where @xmath443 , an equivalent system is obtained by replacing one of the three equations above by the simpler continuity equation which follows from ( [ constring ] ) , i.e. , @xmath444 and we will , in fact , replace the scalar equation of motion .    dividing the first of the gravitational equations ( [ gequ ] ) by @xmath3 we deduce @xmath445 for constant @xmath446 .",
    "so @xmath298 is determined by the scale factor . the continuity equation is easily integrated , and yields @xmath332 in terms of the scale factor and a constant @xmath447 .",
    "explicitly we find    @xmath448    the remaining equation we have to solve in order to obtain the string dust solution follows from the second gravitational equation in ( [ gequ ] ) : @xmath449 we are interested in the effective equation of state parameter for the perfect fluid that is created by area metric cosmology in addition to einstein cosmology . hence we rewrite the defining relations for the parameters @xmath450 and @xmath438 in ( [ statepar ] ) using the above equations .",
    "this yields @xmath451 for @xmath452 .",
    "hence the definition of the parameter @xmath428 results in @xmath453 we conclude that once we have a solution of ( [ aeq ] ) for the scale factor @xmath454 , the whole system of equations is integrated , and provides @xmath332 , @xmath298 and @xmath428 .",

    "first , area metric cosmology predicts an open late universe , since the closed cosmology is inconsistent .",
    "second , and most strikingly , area metric cosmology may naturally explain , for all @xmath463 and @xmath494 cosmologies , the late - time acceleration of the universe !",
    "this explanation neither invokes fundamentally unexplained concepts such as a cosmological constant or other forms of dark energy , nor does it invoke fine - tuning since the acceleration automatically tends to small values at late time ; these results become consequences of area geometry applied to the very simplest scenario , cosmology .",
    "this paper is based on the hypothesis that spacetime is an area metric manifold , which presents a true generalization of metric geometry in dimensions greater than three . by constructing a rigid extension of general relativity to area metric geometry , which can explain the acceleration of the late universe without additional assumptions , we have shown that this idea can be taken to surprisingly interesting conclusions .",
    "the physically immediately relevant case of a four - dimensional area metric manifold is distinguished , since we have shown that the area metric geometry on three - dimensional submanifolds is equivalent to some metric geometry .",
    "this reconciles the idea of an area metric spacetime with the phenomenological fact that we can measure lengths and angles in our individual spatial sections .",
    "paying tribute to the phenomenal success of the metric description of spacetime in general relativity , we have constructed curvature invariants that are downward compatible to their metric counterparts .",
    "crucial for this achievement was the extraction of an effective spacetime metric from the fundamental area metric data .",
    "the availability of an area metric curvature scalar , which reduces to the metric ricci tensor precisely for a metric - induced area metric , in particular allows us to read the einstein - hilbert action as dynamics for an area metric .",
    "remarkably , the equations of motion , derived by variation with respect to the area metric , are of second differential order .",
    "this circumvention of lovelock s theorem @xcite ( which for metric manifolds asserts that standard general relativity is the only geometric gravity theory with second order equations ) underlines one remarkable aspect of this modification of general relativity .",
    "another distinguished feature is that the area metric extension of einstein gravity is rigid , in the sense that it does not use an undetermined deformation ( length ) scale to add derivative or curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action , see e.g. @xcite , nor does it simply add additional fields propagating on a given background metric , as do scalar tensor theories , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we saw that the theory is downward compatible to general relativity in vacuo : every vacuum solution of einstein s equations also solves the vacuum equations of area metric gravity . upon the inclusion of matter ,",
    "however , solutions of einstein - hilbert gravity no longer induce solutions of area metric gravity .",
    "a case in point is the area metric einstein - maxwell theory , which is only consistent for true area metric backgrounds . in other words , not only can electromagnetic fields propagate on an area metric background , but their backreaction requires a deviation from a purely metric spacetime .",
    "the simplest departure from standard metric theory occurs for area metrics of almost metric type , which are determined by a metric and a single scalar .",
    "we have shown that the vacuum equations of area metric gravity for this situation are causally well - behaved ; conformal transformation and field redefinition demonstrates their equivalence to einstein gravity coupled to a free scalar field .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the equations arising from area metric gravity have to be interpreted without these transformations , since they are not available in the generic , not almost metric , case .",
    "the scalar field in the almost metric setting therefore must not be regarded as a field on a metric background , but is itself part of the area metric geometry .",
    "the consequences of this mechanism become most apparent in cosmology , which is of the almost metric type , where the scalar in fact behaves as an effective radiation fluid , unlike a standard scalar field .",
    "an area metric structure of spacetime implies that strings , not point particles , are the minimal mechanical objects one may discuss @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that the notion of a fluid in cosmology has to be built on an integrable distribution of local worldsheets , rather than on a velocity field for worldlines .",
    "we have discussed string fluids arising in this way , and shown that they covariantly describe any collection of matter fields consistent with area metric cosmology .",
    "so string fluids can be seen as matter averaged over large scales .",
    "we find a remarkable correspondence between , on the one hand , area metric cosmology coupled to the most general consistent string fluid , and , on the other hand , einstein cosmology coupled to a standard perfect fluid .",
    "the energy density and pressure of this effective perfect fluid are given in terms of four functions : the scalar and three parameters of the string fluid .",
    "this implies an enormous freedom in the effective equation of state parameter which may , in principle , take any real value .    for",
    "the late universe one may assume that matter has spread out so much that interactions are no longer important .",
    "we have derived exact solutions for area metric cosmology filled with string dust , i.e. , with non - interacting string fluids .",
    "while they show some similarity to the solutions of a dust - filled einstein universe , a remarkable feature emerges that can not be realized in general relativity : independent of the spatial curvature , area metric cosmology explains the observed small late - time acceleration of our universe @xcite .",
    "this effect is a consequence of area geometry ; it does not invoke a cosmological constant nor additional quintessence fields , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "neither does this result depend on fine - tuning , since one of the nice features is that the acceleration automatically tends to zero with time .",
    "so the idea of spacetime as an area metric manifold can be taken very far indeed , has a common conceptual basis in the structure of string and gauge theory , and provides a very encouraging first cosmological prediction , too .",
    "but , as can be expected from any novel theoretical framework , a number of open ends remains to be addressed .",
    "the most pressing one from a phenomenological point of view is whether area metric gravity passes solar system tests .",
    "this question is certainly solvable , but complicated by the fact that a spherically symmetric area metric is generically not almost metric , but contains one further scalar degree of freedom .",
    "while we have shown that every vacuum solution of einstein gravity , i.e. , in particular the schwarzschild solution , induces a vacuum solution of area metric gravity , it is not clear whether this vacuum solution consistently extends to a solution with matter  having learnt that the inclusion of matter may require deviations from metric geometry . in the metric case life is simpler because of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "another such physical issue is the discussion of fermions , which might be introduced by their dirac algebra with respect to the effective metric .    on the mathematical side , a precise understanding of the degrees of freedom united in the area",
    "metric is needed .",
    "this includes in particular the connection to string theory , where true area metrics emerge as combinations of a metric and a two - form potential .",
    "this problem is likely related to the question of possible relations between area metric geometry and generalized geometries emerging in string theory , such as generalized complex geometry  @xcite or t - folds  @xcite .",
    "if one ventures to consider an area metric spacetime structure as a geometrization of the string idea , which we feel is structurally quite natural , one ultimately has to find out how to quantize strings on an area metric background ; given that the trace anomaly in quantized string theory is determined essentially by the two - dimensional worldsheet curvature @xcite and that the area metric curvature vanishes in two - dimensions , one may for instance speculate that a successful string quantization based on area metric geometry modifies the standard no - ghost theorems @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of these issues is of course needed , and remains the subject of future work .",
    "in this appendix we lay down our conventions for the coordinate representations of objects and operations .",
    "let @xmath16 be a @xmath0-dimensional smooth manifold and @xmath495 a basis of @xmath20 .",
    "this basis canonically induces the basis @xmath496 of @xmath497 which is of dimension @xmath498 .",
    "any section @xmath57 of @xmath497 can be expanded in this basis in the following form , @xmath499 which defines the components of @xmath57 .",
    "note that we adhere to the convention that sums over numbered indices @xmath500 , _ only _ on totally _",
    "anti_-symmetric objects , are ordered sums over @xmath501 . as an immediate consequence of this convention we find the components of exterior products of sections @xmath502 and @xmath503 : @xmath504}\\,.\\ ] ] a basis @xmath505 of @xmath83 induces the canonical basis @xmath506 of @xmath507 which is dual to ( [ basis1 ] ) if @xmath505 is dual to @xmath495 , in which case @xmath508}_{b_k]}\\,,\\ ] ] where the right hand side are precisely the components of the identity on @xmath497 .",
    "we also define contraction symbols for @xmath509 and @xmath510 :    @xmath511    for k - forms @xmath512 we define the exterior derivative such that @xmath513}\\epsilon^{a_1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\epsilon^{a_{k+1}}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "this appendix contains full technical detail of the derivation of the equations of motion of area metric gravity in four dimensions .",
    "these are obtained from variation , with respect to the inverse area metric , of the action @xmath350 proposed in ( [ totalaction ] ) in section [ gravtheory ] .",
    "this action contains , through the area metric curvature tensor ( [ areacurv ] ) , covariant derivatives of the @xmath157-tensors , which we remove by partial integration . for this purpose note that covariant derivatives involving the tangent bundle connection @xmath215 integrated over the area manifold are no longer surface terms , since the area metric is not covariantly constant under this connection .",
    "instead the following formula holds for partial integration : @xmath514 where @xmath515 . using this result",
    "we obtain the four - dimensional action in the alternative form @xmath516 which is classically equivalent to the original action on manifolds without boundary . as a shorthand",
    "we have used the definition @xmath517 in contracting the @xmath157-tensors , where deltas with multiple indices simply denote products of single deltas , e.g. @xmath518 .",
    "we proceed to vary the action ( [ varyac ] ) with respect to the area metric , which is determined by its decomposition into the irreducible algebraic curvature tensor @xmath28 and the scalar @xmath148 as in ( [ scheme ] ) .",
    "the calculation is not difficult , but rather long , and will be presented in several steps .",
    "we begin with a variation with respect to the effective metric @xmath146 , which of course still depends both on @xmath28 , via the fresnel tensor , and on @xmath148 via the chosen natural section @xmath142 of the cotangent bundle .",
    "the dependence on the effective metric in all covariant derivatives @xmath215 , also in the tensors @xmath157 , has to be taken account .",
    "variation of the levi - civita connection and of the corresponding riemann curvature tensor with respect to a given metric are standard .",
    "we explicitly provide these variations with respect to the inverse metric .",
    "then , for connection and curvature    [ h1 ] @xmath519    where we use another notational shorthand , @xmath520 the same remark as above applies for deltas with multiple indices .",
    "the variation of the @xmath157-tensor with respect to the effective metric follows as @xmath521}_{t|j]}\\right)\\nabla^{lc}_x\\delta g_g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\,.\\label{h3}\\ ] ] employing these relations and performing all necessary partial integrations one hence obtains the expression @xmath522}_{t|j ] } \\right)\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } - \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\delta^{xw}_{\\alpha\\beta}-g_g^{xw}g_{g\\,\\alpha\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\nabla^{lc}_xx_w+\\frac{1}{6}x_xx_w\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our second step is the variation of the action with respect to all explicitly occurring area metrics ; these appear in the volume form , and also in the @xmath157-tensors .",
    "explicitly we have    @xmath523    application of these two identities finally yields the expression @xmath524    in order to obtain the full variation of the action , we last but not least have to consider the dependence of the effective metric and of the area metric itself on the irreducible parts  @xmath28 and  @xmath148 of the area metric , and then to combine all terms . for the area metric",
    "we find @xmath525 the expressions for the effective metric are more elaborate . in our mainly plus signature convention these are given by @xmath526 and @xmath527 where the characteristic function @xmath92 evaluated on the section @xmath142 , see ( [ character ] ) , appears .",
    "we also use the abbreviations @xmath528 , @xmath529 and @xmath530 .",
    "the final result for the combined terms resulting from the total variation of the action @xmath531 may now be written in the simple form @xmath532 note that in reaching this result another partial integration has to be performed on the terms arising from the variation @xmath533 . the final result for @xmath282",
    "is then given by the expression @xmath534 the almost final result for @xmath280 is given by the following expression @xmath535 which , however , does not yet have the correct symmetry structure : @xmath536 to obtain the correct @xmath280 note that this term must have the symmetries of an algebraic curvature tensor since these symmetries are imposed by its contraction with @xmath537 in equation ( [ result ] ) . to correct procedure",
    "thus is to project onto this irreducible representation by removing the totally antisymmetric part : @xmath538 the positive sign between both terms is a consequence of the lorentzian signature .",
    "finally , we arrive at the vacuum gravity equations for four - dimensional area metric manifolds .",
    "vanishing variation @xmath539 with respect to the inverse area metric implies the following two equations , corresponding to its cyclic and totally antisymmetric parts , respectively : @xmath540",
    "in section [ solar ] we have discussed almost metric area metrics @xmath291 , which are determined by a metric and scalar field , as those closest to standard lorentzian manifolds . for this rather simple case",
    "occurs a significant simplification of the four - dimensional equations of motion that have been derived in detail in the preceding section .",
    "we will now present this simplification in some more detail as a basis for our discussion of area metric cosmology in the main text .    essentially because of the simple form ( [ metricfresnel ] ) of the fresnel tensor in the almost metric case , we find that the inner bracket in the @xmath148-variation , see @xmath282 in ( [ vphi ] ) , is identically zero , and hence its derivative is .",
    "hence @xmath541 in vacuo this expression must vanish by equation ( [ vac ] ) , which simply requires that @xmath542 should be an algebraic curvature tensor .    a similarly drastic simplification occurs for the variation with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "we expand all terms that multiply @xmath543 in equation ( [ vcalmost ] ) , while at the same time imposing the algebraic curvature tensor symmetries on the indices @xmath355 .",
    "this results in @xmath544\\beta}+\\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{(ab)}_{\\alpha[\\gamma}g_{g\\,\\delta]\\beta}\\,.\\ ] ] the simplified form of the @xmath28-equation then follows as @xmath545\\beta}+\\frac{1}{2}v_{g_g\\,[\\alpha[\\gamma}g_{g\\,\\delta]\\beta]}\\nonumber\\\\ & & { } + \\frac{1}{12}\\phi k^\\phi g_{g\\,\\alpha[\\gamma}g_{g\\,\\delta]\\beta}+v_{g\\,\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}+\\frac{1}{24}k^\\phi\\omega_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the antisymmetrization in the second term is supposed to act only on the index pairs @xmath356 $ ] and @xmath546 $ ] .",
    "this equation indeed has the symmetries of an algebraic curvature tensor ; this is ensured by the addition of the last term which removes the totally antisymmetric part of  @xmath542 .",
    "the inverse @xmath547 of @xmath151 has already been displayed in ( [ invlift ] ) .",
    "this expression immediately enables us to calculate the @xmath157-tensor as @xmath548}_{cd}\\right).\\ ] ] we now have all the information needed to further simplify the above expressions for @xmath282 and @xmath280 in the almost metric case . for the @xmath148-variation",
    "we simply find @xmath549 the @xmath28-variation @xmath280 which is a rank four tensor turns out to conform to a very particular structure .",
    "it is in fact induced from a symmetric rank two tensor @xmath293 as shown in equation  ( [ factorized ] ) , where @xmath550 our main application of these expressions in this paper is to area metric cosmology .",
