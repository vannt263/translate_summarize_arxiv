    "the interplay among the electronic and mechanical properties of graphene membranes remains under experimental and theoretical investigation @xcite , and an insightful picture of the effects of deformations employs gauge fields that influence the dynamics of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the formulation is inherently semi - classical and takes pseudospin hamiltonians as the main object , which strictly speaking are only valid on the ideal non - deformed crystalline structure , with gauge fields arising from slow - varying mechanical deformations providing local modifications to the said hamiltonian .",
    "but graphene can sustain elastic deformations as large as 20% @xcite and using this picture , the resulting pseudo - magnetic fields are much larger than those magnetic fields available in state - of - the - art experimental facilities .",
    "the presence of a pseudo - magnetic field is observed via broad landau levels ( lls ) in strained graphene nanobubbles on a metal substrate @xcite .",
    "in addition to the pseudo - magnetic vector potential @xmath2 , strain also induces a scalar deformation potential @xmath3 @xcite that affects the electron dynamics in non - trivial ways .",
    "part of our motivation was to reconcile the experimental results that can be obtained when the lattice is largely deformed , with a theory that by construction applies to small deformations .",
    "what we accomplished is a close view at the inner workings of this theory that has led to unique insights , and a quantitative understanding of `` slowly varying deformations '' within the context of this theory .",
    "our formulation brings to the spotlight some of the inherent assumptions on the prevailing theoretical framework .",
    "the underlying assumptions of the theory expressed on a structural continuum are expressed in the following sentence : `` if a mechanical strain varies smoothly on the scale of interatomic distances , it does not break sublattice symmetry but rather deforms the brillouin zone in such a way that the dirac cones located in graphene at points @xmath4 and @xmath5 are shifted in opposite directions  @xcite . ''",
    "previous statement tells us that _provided strain preserves sublattice symmetry_ one can understand the effects of mechanical strain on the electronic structure in terms of a semiclassical approach , in which mechanical strain induces the spatially - varying gauge fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 into a spatially - varying pseudospin hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the low - energy expansion of the hamiltonian in reciprocal space in the absence of strain .",
    "this semiclassical approximation is justified when the strain extends over many unit cells and it preserves sublattice symmetry @xcite , and many of the equations on this section will help us keep track of said sublattice symmetry .",
    "evidently , it is possible to determine the electronic properties directly from a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath10 in real space , without resorting to the semiclassical approximation and without imposing a sublattice symmetry _ a priori_. that is , while the semiclassical @xmath8 is defined in reciprocal space ( thus assuming some reasonable preservation of crystalline order ) , the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath10 in real space is more general and can be used for membranes with arbitrary spatial distribution and magnitude of the strain .    in the previous formulation of the theory both @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are expressed in terms of a _ continuous _ displacement field @xmath11 obtained within first - order continuum elasticity ( ce ) @xcite .",
