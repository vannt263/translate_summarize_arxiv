    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna systems are the key elements for the current 4 g and future 5 g wireless networks , which have the potential to support high data rates of more than 1 gbps @xcite-@xcite . among the different performance metrics for mimo antennas ,",
    "envelope correlation coefficient ( ecc ) is one of the most important parameter as it characterizes the mutual correlation between the communication channels in any multi - antenna system @xcite .",
    "different diversity techniques like spatial diversity , pattern diversity and polarization diversity are employed to ensure low value of ecc in the working bandwidth of the mimo antenna system @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus , characterizing the ecc for a given mimo configuration over a specified antenna bandwidth is a problem of utmost importance for system .",
    "the general formula for computation of ecc utilizes the radiated far - fields of the individual antennas , with other antennas terminated in matched load condition @xcite-@xcite . but this procedure requires complete evaluation of the 3d radiation patterns at all the frequencies in the antenna bandwidth .",
    "this makes the process tedious in terms of measurement as well as computation . in @xcite , it is proved from a simple derivation that ecc can be determined using the s - parameters of the multi - antenna system , when lossless and single - mode antennas are considered .",
    "this s - parameter based evaluation of ecc considerably reduces the difficulties of the far - field based method , but it suffers from some serious drawbacks .",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite that when the antenna system is lossy , which is the case in any practical situation , the s - parameter based formula as derived in @xcite is not valid . some corrective measures for ecc calculation of lossy antenna systems",
    "are suggested in @xcite , which involve inclusion of the antenna efficiencies in the s - parameter based expression of ecc .",
    "however it is well pointed out in @xcite-@xcite , that a lot of issues still exist with this s - parameter based ecc calculation .",
    "it is elaborated in @xcite that the s - parameter based method can give erroneous results for cases with zero or weak mutual coupling between antenna elements . also when strong mutual coupling is present between the two excited antennas , and an electromagnetically coupled third object ( scatterer or another antenna )",
    "is also present in the surrounding environment , the s - parameters based formula becomes ambiguous and produces wrong results @xcite .",
    "it is commented in @xcite that ecc of a mimo system depends on the entire current on the antenna surfaces .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to compute ecc based on s - parameters only , since s - parameters are relevant only to the currents at the physical antenna ports .",
    "+ a useful alternative technique for ecc calculation is recently introduced by researchers , which uses spatial antenna current distributions instead of the 3d far - field patterns of the antennas @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this technique requires the evaluation of cross - correlation green s functions ( cgf ) , along with the amplitude and phase distribution of antenna currents on the antenna structure , to accurately determine the ecc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of this cgf - based procedure relies on approximating the current distribution on any given antenna structure into a combination of infinitesimal radiating dipole elements having currents of appropriate amplitude and phase .",
    "the effects of all such infintesimal dipole elements are combined using cgf to obtain the desired ecc value @xcite . a method - of - moments based",
    "approach using cgf is shown in @xcite , for calculating ecc and diversity gain of thin - wire dipole antenna systems .",
    "also genetic algorithm ( ga ) based techniques are formulated in @xcite-@xcite , to predict the optimum antenna current distributions that can provide the best ecc and diversity performance .",
    "however , the procedures introduced in @xcite-@xcite are mainly targeted for evaluation of ecc of mimo antenna systems at a single frequency .",
    "since recent focus of mimo antenna designers is on development of multi - band and ultrawideband mimo antennas @xcite-@xcite , fast ecc evaluation over a wide frequency band is desired for practical purposes .",
    "the s - parameter based method , although flawed in several respects , facilitates this fast and wideband computation of ecc for a given mimo antenna system .",
    "this is why many antenna designers still resort to this s - parameter based method for ecc calculation in multi - band or wideband mimo antenna systems , inspite of the ambiguities present in it @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in this work , the cgf - based procedure of ecc calculation of @xcite-@xcite is integrated with finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) simulation to obtain wideband frequency variation of ecc for a given mimo antenna system .",
    "this technique is designated as fdtd - cgf scheme throughout this manuscript .",
    "although fdtd simulations have been applied in mimo system analysis @xcite-@xcite , integration of cgf approach with fdtd for ecc computation has not been previously reported , to the best of the knowledge of the authors .",
    "two different post - processing techniques for this fdtd - cgf based scheme are proposed , one based on frequency - domain ( fd ) calculations , another using time - domain ( td ) methods .",
    "the td - based post - processing gives wideband ecc results in very less computation time and good accuracy , which makes it more suitable as compared to the fd - scheme .",
    "although fd post - processing of cgf using mom based antenna analysis is reported in @xcite , such td post - processing method of cgf has not been reported in literature , to the best of the knowledge of the authors . at this point",
    ", it should be noted that the prescribed fdtd - cgf technique is fundamentally different from the discrete green s function ( dgf ) based fdtd formulation as discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of dgf - fdtd is mainly to use fdtd from a system point of view , such that the accuracy and efficiency of the fdtd method is improved @xcite .",
    "applications of dgf - fdtd for simulations of wire antennas that are mutually coupled with inhomogeneous dielectric objects as well as for uwb antenna analysis have been reported @xcite-@xcite . however",
    ", dgf - fdtd has not been directly applied for mimo antenna systems .",
    "the proposed fdtd - cgf technique utilizes conventional yee s fdtd grids and continuous cgfs for post - processing and ecc computation , unlike the dgf - fdtd technique . although there is possibility of using cgfs along with dgf - fdtd , that aspect is not explored in this paper . +",

    "this section provides the stepwise formulation of the fdtd - cgf technique for calculation of ecc of any mimo antenna system dover wide frequency range . from the definition as discussed in @xcite,@xcite , the ecc ( or @xmath0 ) between two antennas ( designated as antenna-1 and antenna-2 ) can be obtained from the 3d far - field radiation patterns of the individual antennas from the formula : @xmath1    it is assumed that the antennas 1 and 2 are radiating in uniform multipath environment of balanced polarization ( i.e. , an isotropic environment ) @xcite .",

    "the integration with respect to the full solid angle @xmath5 is represented by @xmath6 .",
    "the spatial current - density distributions when antennas 1 and 2 are excited respectively at angular frequency @xmath2 are represented by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively . the field cross - correlation term in the numerator expression of @xmath9 as shown in , can be evaluated from the antenna current distributions using the following formula @xcite : @xmath10    here @xmath11 is the dyadic tensor representation for the cross - correlation green s function ( cgf ) as defined in @xcite .",
    "the symbol `` @xmath12 '' denotes the complex conjugate operation .",
    "it is assumed the two current - densities @xmath7 and @xmath8 are nonzero in the volume @xmath13 , which are bounded subregions of the entire space @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath15 where ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , can be calculated from the components of antenna current - densities and dyadic cgf as follows : @xmath18 here @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the term @xmath21 can be expanded in a general form as : @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the wave - number , where @xmath24 is the velocity of electromagnetic wave in free space .",
    "the radial unit vector in spherical co - ordinate systems is designated by @xmath25 . the function @xmath26 standing for the @xmath27 dependent time - advancement ( or time - delay ) ,",

    "the expressions for the angular cross - correlation component functions @xmath36 are obtained from @xcite and provided in the appendix for the sake of completeness . substituting expression of @xmath37 from into the expression of @xmath15",

    "hence desired information ( mainly scattering parameters ) over a broadband frequency range can be extracted by computing suitable fourier transforms of time domain currents / voltages .",
    "it is quite evident here that if the antenna current - density distributions in time domain ( i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) can be calculated from an fdtd simulation , the ecc for a broad frequency range denoted by @xmath9 in , can calculated by following two distinct methods as described below .",
    "this method involves the calculation of the cgf using in frequency - domain ( fd ) itself to determine @xmath9 .",
    "the complex antenna current densities at different locations for different @xmath2 are computed via fourier transform of the antenna currents at those locations , and used alongwith the cgf in frequency domain .",

    "5 .   finally using , the ecc for wide frequency range is computed using the values of field cross - correlation and self - correlation terms .      in this technique , instead of calculating the cgf directly in frequency - domain , its effect is embedded in the time - domain ( td ) calculations by suitable signal - processing methods .",
    "operations like time - reversal , convolution and integrations are performed on the temporal current density profiles , to get the desired @xmath9 .",
    "the following steps are involved :    1 .",
    "once the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are obtained from fdtd simulations , the term @xmath60 is computed using .",
    "2 .   using suitable @xmath36 and performing numerical integration on its product with delayed / advanced versions of @xmath61 as indicated in ,",
    "the term @xmath39 is evaluated .",
    "once @xmath39 is obtained , the field cross - correlation term can be calculated by summation , numerical integration and fourier transform using .",

    "5 .   after determining @xmath51 for @xmath20 , the field self - correlation terms",
    "are obtained utilizing .",
    "once the numerator and denominator expressions for @xmath9 are evaluated , broadband calculation of ecc is done in a straightforward fashion using .    at this point",
    "some general comments can be made regarding the two above - mentioned post - processing methods ( fdtd - cgf - fd and fdtd - cgf - td ) for computing @xmath9 . in the fdtd - cgf - fd technique , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "can be obtained from their respective time - domain waveforms by fourier transform .",
    "but the values of @xmath21 have to be calculated for all the frequency values within the range of interest .",
    "as observed from , this involves evaluation of integrals that can be performed with the help of in - built quadrature routines of matlab .",
    "this is the step that consumes most of the post - processing time in fdtd - cgf - fd technique , when high frequency resolution is required .",
    "it should be noted here that the integral in can also be evaluated analytically , as indicated in @xcite .",
    "this can potentially lead to reduction in the processing time of fdtd- cgf - fd .",
    "however , analytical evaluation of is not done in this paper and this aspect will be addressed in future works . on the other hand , for the fdtd - cgf - td technique , the quantities @xmath62 , @xmath39 and @xmath63 can be determined directly in time - domain by signal processing operations on the fdtd - computed current waveforms like time - reversal , convolution , delay ( or advancement ) and integration as shown in and .",
    "these operations consume much less time , when performed upon time - domain matlab vectors .",
    "clearly , the steps in the fdtd - cgf - td technique are not directly dependent on the desired frequency resolution , since no requirement of calculating cgf for all the frequencies is there .",
    "it can be observed that the effects of cgf have been embedded in the evaluation of integrals in and .",
    "these integrals can be further reduced to discrete double - summation expressions , by considering small incremental angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this double summation approximation of the integrals in and significantly speeds up the process of calculating @xmath62 , @xmath39 and @xmath63 .",
    "finally , one needs to perform the fourier transforms of these three terms only for computing the ecc value using .",
    "however the accuracy of the evaluated ecc , depends on the values of the incremental angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 , as will be evident from the discussion in section [ s4 ] .",
    "thus can be intuitively concluded that although fdtd - cgf - fd is inherently more accurate for broadband evaluation of @xmath9 , the computation time will be increased considerably if the desired frequency resolution is very high . on the other hand , fdtd - cgf - td technique will be comparatively faster to calculate @xmath9 , but the accuracy will largely depend upon the choice of incremental angles @xmath64 and @xmath65 for numerical evaluation of the integral in and .",
    "these intuitive predictions will be further elaborated upon in the next section , using the results obtained via fdtd simulation and subsequent post - processing .",
    "in this section , ecc over a wide frequency range is calculated for two mimo antenna systems , by using the two methods discussed in the previous section .",

    "it should be noted at this point that the concept of frequency domain solution of cgf using mom was already introduced in [ 12 ] , but the issue of wideband computation of ecc was not stressed upon there . in this work , cgf computation is done using currents obtained from fdtd , and a time - domain ( td ) post - processing scheme is introduced along with the frequency - domain ( fd ) method .",
