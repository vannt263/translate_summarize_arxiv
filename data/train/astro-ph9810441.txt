    "a cooling neutron star cools initially through neutrino emission before making a transition to photon cooling at an age of @xmath7 yr ( see tsuruta 1998 for a comprehensive review ; see fig .",
    "1 ) . internal heating processes , if they occur , could affect when and how abruptly the star makes the transition to photon cooling . later , when the heating power begins to exceed the luminosity from residual heat , the heat source would control the star s thermal evolution . internal heating processes that could occur include superfluid frictional heating ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ; alpar  1987 ; shibazaki & lamb 1989 ; @xcite ; umeda  1993 ; van riper , link & epstein 1995 ) , structural readjustment through plastic flow or `` starquakes '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; cheng   1992 ) , chemical disequilibrium driven by the star s spin - down ( reisenegger 1995 ) , and magnetic field decay ( thompson & duncan 1996 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) .",
    "temperature measurements of neutron stars older than @xmath7 yr provide strong tests of cooling models in the photon cooling era , and offer the possibility of constraining the heating processes that might occur .",
    "in particular , the recent temperature measurements of psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 by pavlov , stringfellow & crdova ( 1996 ) pose a serious challenge to standard cooling models , and seem in fact to demand internal heating at rates of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively ( see fig . 1 . )    in this paper we explore the possibility that heat generated by friction between the neutron star crust and the interior neutron fluid is the dominant heating processes taking place in old neutron stars with conventional magnetic fields ( @xmath12 g ) .",
    "most of the mass of a neutron star is expected to be in the form of a neutron superfluid that condenses shortly after the star s birth ( migdal 1959 ) .",
    "large velocity differences between the superfluid and the crust could develop in the star s inner crust , where the vortices that thread the rotating superfluid pin to nuclei ( @xcite ; @xcite ; alpar 1977 ; epstein &  baym 1988 ; @xcite ) .",
    "differential rotation between the stellar crust and the superfluid would lead to frictional heat generation , while variations in the frictional coupling would affect the star s spin behavior .",
    "studies of superfluid friction in the inner crust indicate that the coupling can be highly temperature - dependent , scaling with temperature as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an energy @xmath15 ( see , , alpar   1984 ; link , epstein & baym 1993 ; chau & cheng 1993 ) .",
    "the star s thermal and rotational evolution are thus coupled and must be considered together . usually the core superfluid is regarded as corotating with the stellar crust , though sedrakian & sedrakian ( 1995 ; see also sedrakian & cordes 1998 ) have suggested that interactions between superfluid vorticity in the core with the london current near the crust - core interface could maintain differential rotation between the crust and core . in this case , friction between the core superfluid and the normal matter could also be a heat source .",
    "the goal of this paper is to describe the role played by superfluid friction in late - time neutron star thermal evolution .",
    "though heat generation in the core is a possibility , we will focus primarily on friction in the crust , as the coupling there has been studied in detail .",
    "we consider first (  3 ) the case in which the superfluid is in rotational equilibrium , spinning down at the same rate as the crust .",
    "this case was originally considered by alpar  ( 1987 ) and applied to the upper limit on the luminosity of psr 1929 + 10 available at the time to obtain a constraint on the excess angular momentum residing in the superfluid . in later work ,",
    "shibazaki & lamb ( 1989 ) , umeda  ( 1993 ) , and van riper , link & epstein ( 1995 ) included the effects of superfluid friction in simulations of neutron star thermal evolution to obtain further constraints on the heating through this process",
    ". this study is largely motivated by the recent measurements of the temperatures of the old pulsars psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 ( pavlov , stringfellow & crdova 1996 ) , which , as we show , provide the most stringent constraints to date on the rotation of the superfluid interior .",
    "a crucial issue in neutron star thermal evolution is the possible development of thermal instabilities .",
    "shibazaki and mochizuki ( 1994 ; hereafter sm ) have shown that under certain circumstances a feedback instability between the star s thermal and rotational states can occur if the frictional coupling of the superfluid to the crust is sufficiently sensitive to temperature ; as heat is generated , the frictional coupling is increased , creating more heat .",
    "the star executes a limit cycle in which its temperature oscillates about the temperature at which it is marginally stable , accompanied by oscillations in the rotation rate .",
    "this case we study in detail in  4 .",
    "we conclude that the coupling of the superfluid to the crust is nearly independent of temperature in a star older than @xmath9 yr , effectively decoupling the star s rotational and thermal evolution . in  5 we use x - ray and optical data from cooling neutron stars to obtain constraints on the excess angular momentum residing in the superfluid .",
    "1 shows a comparison of thermal evolution calculations ( neglecting possible internal heating ) with the surface temperature measurements of eight neutron stars .",
    "residual heat is adequate to explain the temperatures of the younger objects , but can not account for the temperatures of psr 1929 + 10 and psr 0950 + 08 .",
    "pavlov , stringfellow & crdova ( 1996 ) have measured temperatures of @xmath16 k for psr 1929 + 10 and @xmath17 k for psr 0950 + 08 ( see  5.1 for further discussion of the observations ) .",
    "the discrepancy between these measurements and the predictions of cooling theory is far too large to be accounted for by atmospheric uncertainties or modification of the energy transport by a magnetic field , and internal heating is required .",
    "we now discuss several candidate heating processes : superfluid friction , structural relaxation , chemical disequilibrium and magnetic field decay .",
    "differential rotation between the neutron star crust and the neutron superfluid would generate heat through friction .",
    "if the superfluid and crust are in rotational equilibrium with respect to each other ( both slowing down at the same rate ) , the heating power is ( shibazaki & lamb 1989 ; van riper , link & epstein 1995 ; umeda  1993 ; see eq . [ [ pp ] ] below )    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the excess angular momentum residing in the superfluid , @xmath20 is the moment of inertia of the portion of the superfluid that is differentially rotating , @xmath21 is the angular velocity difference between the two components averaged over the superfluid moment of inertia and @xmath22 is the spin - down rate . in principle , the heat could be generated anywhere in the star in which there are superfluid neutrons .",
    "usually , however , the superfluid in the core is regarded as tightly coupled to the rotation of the solid through fermi liquid effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "analyses of glitch data ( @xcite ) and spin variations in accreting neutron stars ( @xcite ) and in isolated pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) support this picture . in the inner crust , however , interaction between crustal nuclei and superfluid vorticity could lead to substantial differential rotation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and heating . the velocity difference that can develop is determined by uncertain microphysics",
    ", however , @xmath21 could exceed @xmath6 rad s@xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a star with a stiff equation of state and a thick crust ,",
    "@xmath19 could then be as large as @xmath23 ergs s , in which case the heating power is approximately    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the star s spin period , @xmath26 is the spindown age @xmath27 , and a rapid initial spin rate was assumed . a heating rate this large would begin to play an important role in thermal evolution after @xmath7 yr , when @xmath28 becomes comparable to the luminosity from residual heat .",
    "another process that heats the star is structural relaxation occurring as the star spins down and becomes less oblate .",
    "the neutron star crust probably becomes brittle when its temperature drops below @xmath29 k ( ruderman 1976 ) at an age of @xmath30 yr , and subsequently suffers structural relaxation through violent starquakes .",
    "the rate of heat generation is then of order ( cheng  1992 ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the shear modulus of the crust and @xmath33 is the critical strain angle at which the crust breaks .",
    "the critical strain angle is quite uncertain .",
    "cheng  ( 1992 ) have shown that structural relaxation could constitute an important heat source in older stars if @xmath33 is @xmath34 . however , a value of @xmath33 this large is close to that for a perfect coulomb lattice , while lattice imperfections most likely make @xmath33 considerably smaller ( smolukowski 1970 ) .",
    "we assume that superfluid friction dominates starquake heating .",
    "reisenegger ( 1995 ) has studied heating arising as a neutron star spins down and compression of the matter drives it from chemical equilibrium . for the @xmath12 g fields expected for most isolated neutron",
    "stars this process appears to be relatively unimportant , but could be relevant in stars with small magnetic fields ( @xmath35 g ) .",
    "reisenegger cautions , however , that chemical disequilibrium in superfluid neutron matter could give larger heating rates than those he estimates for normal matter .",
    "thompson & duncan ( 1996 ) have studied heat generation by the decay of a strong magnetic field , and argue that the dominant decay process of a @xmath36 g field is the irrotational mode of ambipolar diffusion ( goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ) . equating the rate of energy loss by field decay to the photon luminosity gives a surface temperature of @xmath37 with @xmath38 relating the surface temperature to the internal temperature using the results of gudmundsson , pethick & epstein ( 1982 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ gpe ] ] below ) we obtain @xmath39 the fields required to account for the observed temperatures of psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 are @xmath40 g and @xmath41 g , respectively .",
    "by contrast , the _ dipole _ fields of these objects inferred from the vacuum dipole model are only @xmath42 g. thus , heating by magnetic field decay appears an unlikely heat source to power the emission of psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 .",
    "the first situation we consider is internal heating arising from steady slow - down of the neutron superfluid . in the next section ,",
    "we study perturbations to this equilibrium state .",
    "we describe a neutron star as consisting of two components - a solid crust and an interior liquid ( the superfluid ) .",
    "the crust is acted upon by an external torque , and the crust and superfluid are coupled through friction .",
    "regardless of the system s initial spin state , eventually an equilibrium will be reached in which the two components are both spinning down at the same rate , with the liquid spinning more rapidly than the solid to a degree determined by the external torque and the strength of the frictional coupling . in this state of rotational equilibrium , friction between the two components generates heat at a rate that is nearly constant ( for an external torque that is changing slowly ) .",
    "the rate of heat production is given by the difference between the rate of change of the total rotational energy of the star and the rate at which work is done by the external torque ( @xcite ; van riper , link & epstein 1995 ) : @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int di_{s}\\vert\\dot\\omega_{s}({\\mathbf r},t)\\vert\\omega({\\mathbf   r},t ) , \\label{ee}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the external braking torque , @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the crust and any components of the star tightly coupled to it , @xmath46 is the superfluid angular velocity at position @xmath47 in the star , @xmath48 is the angular velocity _ lag _ between the superfluid and the crust , and @xmath20 is the superfluid moment of inertia .",
    "[ [ ee ] ] gives the heating rate whether the two components are in rotational equilibrium or not . in rotational equilibrium",
    ", the crust superfluid is everywhere spinning down at the rate of the crust @xmath49 , and the heating rate is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the excess angular momentum in the superfluid and @xmath52 is the lag in equilibrium .",
    "after @xmath9 yr , when the star has lost most of its residual heat , the heating rate is approximately balanced by cooling through the emission of surface photons , ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the radius , @xmath55 is the surface temperature and @xmath56 is the spin - down rate ( subscript @xmath57 indicates quantities seen by a distant observer ; @xmath19 is evaluated at the stellar surface ) .",
    "observed stellar quantities are related to their values at the surface through the redshift @xmath58 as @xmath59 in  5 , we will apply eq .",
    "[ [ steadyrate ] ] to psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 to obtain estimates for the values of @xmath19 required to heat these sources to their observed temperatures .",
    "we now study the stability of the rotational equilibrium described above by determining how a neutron star containing a pinned inner crust superfluid responds to a perturbation of its thermal and rotational state .",
    "this problem was originally considered by sm under the simplifying assumption that the superfluid angular velocity has no gradients .",
    "we extend their work to account for gradients in the superfluid angular velocity lag ( as would arise from vortex pinning ) and the effects of quantum tunneling and vortex self - energy on the superfluid dynamics .",
    "we find ( as did sm ) that under some circumstances a feedback instability that couples the star s thermal and rotational states can occur .",
    "in contrast to sm however , we find that the thermal - rotational instability can not occur in stars older than @xmath60 yr .",
    "while our discussion will be formulated with coupling to the inner crust superfluid in mind , many of our results are general and can be applied to coupling with a core liquid .",
    "the star s total angular momentum changes under an external torque as ( neglecting general relativistic effects ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the moment of inertia of the crust plus any other component(s ) to which it is effectively coupled ( , the core ) , @xmath20 is the superfluid component in differential rotation , and @xmath63 is the total moment of inertia . in rotational equilibrium , the crust superfluid , the crust and the core are all spinning down at a rate @xmath64 .",
    "a neutron star becomes isothermal within @xmath30 yr after its birth ( van riper 1991 ; umeda  1993 ) .",

    "we now review the key results of this work , and study the implications of vortex pinning for the thermal - rotational instability .      were superfluid vortices perfectly pinned to the inner crust lattice , the superfluid velocity would be fixed .",
    "as the solid crust slows under the external torque , a velocity difference between the crust and superfluid would develop exerting a magnus force on the pinned vortices directed radially outward .",

    "this temperature was obtained by interpreting the soft blackbody component of the spectrum as originating from a cooling neutron star of radius @xmath226 10 km .",

    ", the observed temperatures can be accounted for by their residual heat content .",
    "as discussed in  4 , if the thermal - rotational instability occurs , a cooling neutron star can not cool below its critical temperature . by requiring the internal temperature deduced from the observed surface temperature to be greater than or equal to the critical temperature",

    "psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 require significant internal heating to account for their observed temperatures .",
    "a promising candidate heat source is friction between the neutron star crust and the superfluid it contains . in this paper",

    "we conclude that average differential rotation between the superfluid and the crust of @xmath2 rad s@xmath3 and @xmath4 rad s@xmath3 would account for the temperatures of psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 respectively",
    ". a larger lag , @xmath236 rad s@xmath3 , is compatible with the temperature of psr 1055 - 52 .",
    "these differential velocities could be sustained by the pinning of superfluid vortices to the inner crust lattice .",
    "pinned vortices can creep outward through thermal fluctuations or quantum tunneling , depending on the pinning strength and stellar temperature .",
    "for thermally - activated creep , the coupling between the superfluid and crust is highly sensitive to temperature . under some circumstances ,",
    "a feedback instability can occur that brings the superfluid and crust closer to corotation and heats the star until stability is restored .",
    "a hysteresis develops in which the star oscillates about its critical temperature . for stars older than @xmath237 yr",
    ", however , vortex creep occurs through quantum tunneling , and the creep velocity is too insensitive to temperature for a thermal - rotational instability to occur ; these stars are stable .",
    "our conclusion regarding the stability of old stars differs from that of shibazaki & mochizuki ( 1994 ) , who assumed that thermal creep is always the dominant process .",
    "the thermal - rotational instability could , however , occur in younger stars . assuming that young stars are stable or marginally stable leads to upper limits on the superfluid differential velocity of @xmath6 rad s@xmath3 .",
    "these upper limits are consistent with the estimates for @xmath21 obtained for the older psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08",
    ".    the estimates we obtain for @xmath21 are consistent with first - principles calculations of the maximum lag sustainable by vortices before unpinning . based on the pinning calculations of alpar ,",

    "oscillations in the crab pulsar , for example , could occur over a timescale of @xmath250 yr .",
    "detection of such long - period oscillations , especially in the presence of timing irregularities ( , glitches ) , would be problematic .",
    "observational evidence for the thermal - rotational instability in any neutron star would offer valuable insight into the manner in which the neutron star crust is coupled to its superfluid interior .    our estimates for the excess angular momentum @xmath19 required to heat psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 to their observed temperatures hold whether the frictional heat is generated in the crust or in the core . in obtaining constraints on the average lag @xmath21",
    ", we assumed coupling to the inner crust superfluid .",
    "if the coupling is elsewhere , these estimates scale as @xmath251 , where @xmath20 is the moment of inertia of the component that possesses differential rotation .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath252 obtained for young pulsars apply for the crust since the coupling parameters @xmath106 and @xmath105 were determined for vortex creep .",
    "an issue that complicates all interpretations of surface temperatures from cooling neutron stars is the uncertainty in atmospheric composition .",
    "we used the results of blackbody fits in our analysis .",
    "temperature measurements are also available for several pulsars using model atmospheres .",
    "heavy - element atmospheric models produce temperatures similar to the blackbody results",
    ". however , non - magnetic , light - element atmospheres can give temperatures up to three times lower than those obtained with blackbody fits ( romani 1987 ) .",
    "if the temperature were in fact three times lower than the blackbody value , @xmath253 estimated for psrs 1929 + 10 , 0950 + 08 and 1055 - 52 would decrease by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath253 obtained for younger stars would decrease by a factor of three .",
    "hence , the results presented in tables 2 and 3 are conservative and could decrease with improved atmospheric considerations and temperature measurements .",
    "sudden increases in pulsar rotation rates ( _ glitches _ ) have been observed in many younger pulsars and are thought to represent angular momentum transfer from the superfluid to the crust . in the vela pulsar , for example",
    ", fractional changes in the rotation rate of the crust of @xmath254 are observed every few years ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum angular momentum available for a glitch is @xmath19 , giving a maximum glitch magnitude of @xmath255 the upper limit of @xmath256 rad s@xmath3 obtained for vela gives @xmath257 ergs s for the inner crust angular momentum excess , easily compatible with the angular momentum requirements of glitches .",
    "the smaller values obtained for psrs 1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 are also adequate to produce vela - sized glitches , though none has been observed .",
