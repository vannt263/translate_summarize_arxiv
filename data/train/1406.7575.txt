    "thermocapillary migration of a droplet or bubble at a uniform temperature gradient is a very interesting topic in both microgravity and microfluidics@xcite . on the one hand , due to the development of space exploration ,",
    "the studies of the physical mechanism of the droplet / bubble migration phenomena in the microgravity environment become more and more important .",
    "the first investigation of thermocapillary droplet migration was completed by young et al ( ygb ) in 1959 , who gave an analytical prediction for the migration speed at zero limit reynolds(re ) and marangoni(ma ) numbers@xcite .",
    "subramanian@xcite proposed the quasi - steady state assumption for thermocapillary bubble migration and obtained analytical results with high order expansion at small ma numbers .",
    "balasubramanian and chai@xcite derived an exact result for thermocapillary droplet migration at small ma numbers .",
    "the experimental results for the droplet migration speed at small re numbers obtained by braun et al @xcite are in agreement with those of the ygb model .",
    "on the other hand , the manipulation and actuation of droplets in microfluidic devices have an extensive application on the chemical industry and biological engineering .",
    "many interest problems , such as static contact and dynamic control of the droplets on solid substrates , were theoretically analyzed and experimentally observed@xcite .    although the thermocapillary droplet migration processes at small ma numbers under the microgravity environment are understood very well in the series of theoretical analyses and experimental investigations , the physical behaviors at large ma numbers are rather complicated due to the momentum and energy transfer though the interface of two - phase fluids . in large re and ma number area",
    ", it was reported@xcite that the migration speed of a droplet increases with the increase of ma number , as is in qualitative agreement with the corresponding numerical simulation@xcite .",
    "the above theoretical analysis and numerical simulation are based on assumptions of the quasi - steady state and non - deformation of the droplet . the experimental investigation carried out by hadland",
    "et al@xcite and xie et al@xcite showed that the droplet migration speed non - denationalized by the ygb velocity decreases with the increase of ma number .",
    "the results are not in qualitative agreement with the above theoretical and numerical ones .",
    "moreover , a nonconservative integral thermal flux across the surface in the steady thermocapillary droplet migration at large ma(re ) numbers was identified@xcite .",
    "it was indicated that the thermocapillary droplet migration at large ma(re ) numbers is an unsteady process .",
    "therefore , the thermocapillary droplet migration at large ma(re ) numbers remains a topic to be studied with respect to its physical mechanism .    in this paper , first , under the assumption of the quasi - steady process of thermocapillary droplet migration at large re and ma numbers , a thermal source is added in the droplet to change the integral thermal flux across the surface from nonconservative to conservative .",
    "then , we make an analytical result for the steady thermocapillary migration of droplet with the thermal source at large re and ma numbers and elucidate effects of the adding thermal source in the droplet on thermocapillary migration process .",
