    "the determination of conditional independence relationships through graphical models is a key component of the statistical analysis of observational studies .",
    "a pertinent example we will focus on in this paper is a functional disability data set extracted from the `` analytic '' data file for the national long term care survey ( nltcs ) created by the center of demographic studies at duke university .",
    "each observed variable is binary and corresponds to a measure of disability defined by an activity of daily living",
    ". this contingency table cross - classifies information on elderly aged @xmath0 and above pooled across four survey waves , 1982 , 1984 , 1989 and 1994see @xcite for more details .",
    "the @xmath1 dimensions of this table correspond to six activities of daily living ( adls ) and ten instrumental activities of daily living ( iadls ) .",
    "specifically , the adls relate to hygiene and personal care : eating ( adl1 ) , getting in / out of bed ( adl2 ) , getting around inside ( adl3 ) , dressing ( adl4 ) , bathing ( adl5 ) and getting to the bathroom or using a toilet ( adl6 ) .",
    "the iadls relate to activities needed to live without dedicated professional care : doing heavy house work ( iadl1 ) , doing light house work ( iadl2 ) , doing laundry ( iadl3 ) , cooking ( iadl4 ) , grocery shopping ( iadl5 ) , getting about outside ( iadl6 ) , travelling ( iadl7 ) , managing money ( iadl8 ) , taking medicine ( iadl9 ) and telephoning ( iadl10 ) . for each adl / iadl measure",
    ", subjects were classified as being either healthy ( level 1 ) or disabled ( level 2 ) on that measure .",
    "the methodology we develop in this paper allows us to determine the complex pattern of conditional associations that exist among the @xmath1 daily living activities .",
    "this represents a critical issue that was left unexplored in previous analyses of this data set [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "in fact , the domain of applicability of our methods is not restricted to contingency tables .",
    "since multivariate data sets arising from social science or economics typically contain variables of many types , our goal is to develop an approach to graphical model determination that is broad enough to be applicable to any study that involves a mixture of binary , ordinal and continuous variables .",
    "most of the research efforts in the graphical models literature have been focused on multivariate normal models or on log - linear models  see , for example , the monographs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models relate to data sets that contain exclusively continuous or categorical variables .",
    "cg distributions [ @xcite ] constitute the basis of a class of graphical models for mixed variables , but they impose an overly restrictive assumption : the conditional distribution of the continuous variables given the discrete variables must be multivariate normal . as such , the three main classes of graphical models are too restrictive to be widely applicable to social science or economics studies",
    ".    copulas [ @xcite ] provide the theoretical framework in which multivariate associations can be modeled separately from the univariate distributions of the observed variables . @xcite advocate the use of copulas when modeling multivariate distributions involving discrete variables . in this paper",
    "we employ the gaussian copula and further require conditional independence constraints on the inverse of its correlation matrix .",
    "the resulting models are called copula gaussian graphical models ( cggms ) because they only impose a multivariate normal assumption for a  set of latent variables which are in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of observed variables .",
    "a related approach for inference in gaussian copulas has been developed by @xcite .",
    "their framework involves parametric models for gaussian copulas and the univariate marginal distributions of the observed variables.we treat these marginal distributions as nuisance parameters and focus on the determination of graphical models .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : bayeslearn ]",
    "we formally introduce gaussian graphical models ( ggms ) and describe a bayesian framework for inference in this class of models . in section [ sec : ordcar ]",
    "we discuss modeling aspects related to binary and ordinal variables . in section [ sec : copulaggm ] we show how to extend ggms to represent conditional independence associations in a latent variables space . we also present a bayesian model averaging approach for graph identification and estimation in cggms . in section [ sec : examples ] we analyze the nltcs functional disability data together with another six - dimensional contingency table using cggms .",
    "we discuss our proposed methodology in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we let @xmath2 , @xmath3 , be a  random vector with a joint distribution @xmath4 .",
    "the conditional independence relationships among @xmath5 under @xmath4 can be summarized in a graph @xmath6 , where each vertex @xmath7 corresponds with a random variable @xmath8 and @xmath9 are undirected edges [ @xcite ] . here",
    "`` undirected '' means that @xmath10 is equivalent with @xmath11 .",
    "the absence of an edge between @xmath12 and @xmath13 corresponds with the conditional independence of these two random variables given the remaining variables under @xmath4 and is denoted by @xmath14 this is called the pairwise markov property relative to @xmath15 , which in turn implies the local as well as the global markov properties relative to @xmath15 [ @xcite ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the set of all @xmath17 undirected graphs with vertices  @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath16 contains many graphs even for relatively small values of @xmath19 , it can not be enumerated and has to be visited using stochastic search methods [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "such algorithms move through @xmath16 using neighborhood sets @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the neighborhood of a graph @xmath21 is comprised of all the graphs obtained from @xmath15 by adding or deleting one edge .",
    "these neighborhood sets are symmetric and link any two graphs through a path of graphs such that two consecutive graphs on this path are neighbors of each other .",
    "we remark that the neighborhood sets associated with  @xmath16 contain the same number of graphs @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath2 follows a @xmath19-dimensional normal distribution @xmath23 with precision matrix @xmath24 .",
    "we let @xmath25 be the observed data of @xmath26 independent samples of @xmath27 .",
    "the likelihood function is proportional to @xmath28 where @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denotes the trace inner product .",
    "we assume that the data have been centered and scaled , so that the sample mean of each @xmath8 is zero and its sample variance is one .",
    "a graphical model @xmath6 for @xmath31 is called a gaussian graphical model ( ggm ) and is constructed by constraining some of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 to zero .",
    "for example , the pairwise markov property ( [ eq : pairwisemarkov ] ) holds if and only if @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the edges of @xmath15 correspond with the off - diagonal nonzero elements of @xmath32 , that is , .",
    "given @xmath15 , the precision matrix @xmath32 is constrained to the cone @xmath34 of symmetric positive definite matrices with entries @xmath35 equal to zero for all @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "we consider a @xmath15-wishart prior @xmath38 for @xmath32 with density @xmath39 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath34 [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the normalizing constant  @xmath40 is finite provided @xmath41 and @xmath42 is positive definite [ @xcite ] .",
    "if @xmath15 is the complete graph with @xmath19 vertices ( i.e. , there are no missing edges ) , @xmath43 reduces to the wishart distribution @xmath44 , hence , its normalizing constant is @xmath45 where @xmath46 for @xmath47 [ @xcite ] .",
    "if @xmath15 is decomposable , @xmath40 is explicitly calculated [ @xcite ] . for nondecomposable graphs ,",
    "the monte carlo method of @xcite can be used to numerically approximate @xmath40 in a fast and accurate manner .    throughout this paper",
    "we set the prior parameters for @xmath32 to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the @xmath19-dimensional identity matrix . from equations ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) and ( [ eq : wishart ] ) we see that the interpretation of this prior is that the components of @xmath27 are independent apriori and that the `` weight '' of the prior is equivalent to one observed sample .    the @xmath15-wishart prior is conjugate to the likelihood ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) , thus , the posterior distribution of @xmath32 given @xmath15 is @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 given @xmath52 , the regression of @xmath8 on the remaining elements of @xmath27 depends only on the neighbors of @xmath53 in @xmath15 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the cholesky decomposition of a matrix @xmath56 is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an upper triangular matrix with @xmath59 , @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite proved that the set @xmath60 of the free elements of @xmath58 consists of the diagonal elements together with the elements that correspond with the edges of @xmath15 , that is , @xmath61 once the free elements of @xmath58 are known , the remaining elements are also known .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we also have @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . the determination of the elements of @xmath58 that are not free based on the elements of @xmath58 that are free is called the completion of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath15 [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "it is useful to remark that the free elements of @xmath58 fully determine the matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the development of our framework involves the jacobian of the transformation that maps @xmath56 to the free elements of @xmath58 [ @xcite ] : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of elements in @xmath70 .",
    "a variable  @xmath71 that takes a finite number of ordinal values @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , is incorporated in our modeling framework by introducing a continuous latent variable @xmath74 underlying @xmath71see , for example , @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the observed samples associated with @xmath71 .",
    "the samples from @xmath74 are denoted by @xmath76 . typically the relationship between @xmath71 and its surrogate @xmath74 is expressed through some thresholds @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "formally , we set [ @xcite ] @xmath79 this model is identifiable if the value of @xmath80 is fixed at a certain value .",
    "we follow an idea originally suggested by @xcite that does not explicitly involve the thresholds @xmath81 .",
    "this approach is based on the remark that the relationship between the observed and latent samples satisfies the constraints @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "we see that if @xmath71 and @xmath74 are related as in ( [ eq : linkfct ] ) , then ( [ eq : latentconstraints ] ) holds .",
    "if ( [ eq : latentconstraints ] ) holds , then ( [ eq : linkfct ] ) also holds by choosing @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",

    "@xmath106 represents the cdf of the standard normal distribution and @xmath107 is the cdf of @xmath108 .",
    "we avoid the need to formally make assumptions regarding the parametric representation of @xmath109 , which could be a daunting task for most real world data sets , by treating their marginal distributions as nuisance parameters .",
    "moreover , we reduce our model parameters to the correlation matrix of the gaussian copula ( [ eq : gausscopula ] ) .",
    "this means that we focus on the joint distribution of the latent variables @xmath110 whose relationships with the observed variables @xmath111 are given by ( [ eq : relationship ] ) . since @xmath112 and @xmath106 are nondecreasing , ( [ eq : relationship ] ) implies ( [ eq : latentconstraints ] ) which does not depend on the marginal distributions @xmath109 .",
    "the converse is also true : if the relationship ( [ eq : latentconstraints ] ) between the observed and latent samples holds , then ( [ eq : relationship ] ) also holds by replacing @xmath93 with the empirical distribution of @xmath71 .    as suggested by @xcite , inference in the latent variables space can be performed by substituting the observed data @xmath86 with the event @xmath113 .",
    "we write the likelihood function as @xmath114    in this decomposition @xmath115 is the only part of the observed data likelihood that is relevant for making inference on @xmath32 .",

    "we are interested in modeling the conditional independence relationships among the latent variables @xmath119 using gaussian graphical models .",
    "we go one step further compared to @xcite and impose zero constraints in the precision matrix @xmath32 according to a graph @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to the graphical models constructed in the latent space as copula gaussian graphical models ( cggms ) .",
    "the inference approach described in @xcite is equivalent to reducing the set of candidate graphs to only one graph .",
    "this graph is the full graph in which all the edges are present and none of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 are constrained to zero .",
    "the markov properties associated with a cggm are guaranteed to translate into markov properties for the observed variables if all the marginals @xmath109 are continuous [ @xcite ] .",
    "the presence of some discrete observed variables might induce additional dependencies among the @xmath27 s that are not modeled in a cggm , but such dependencies can be regarded as having a secondary relevance since they emerge from the marginals @xmath109 .",
    "the conditional independence graphs for the latent variables could contain edges then that do not necessarily correspond with conditional independence relationships in the observed variables space .",
    "conversely , there might exist conditional independence relationships among the observed variables that are not represented in conditional independence graphs that involve latent variables .      let be a graph defining a cggm . the joint posterior distribution of @xmath52 and the graph @xmath15 is given by @xmath120 the prior distribution of @xmath32 conditional on @xmath15 is @xmath15-wishart @xmath43 and the prior distribution over @xmath16 is uniform , that is , @xmath121 .",

    "the topology of the sampled graphs is indicative of the relative importance of each disability measure with respect to the others in the latent variables space .",
    "the structure of a graph can be summarized by the number of neighbors of each vertex , that is , the number of edges that involve each variable .",
    "this is usually called the degree of a vertex .",
    "a larger degree indicates an increased number of interactions in which a latent variable participates . since in the nltcs data all the latent variables",
    "are positively associated with each other , having one disability increases the likelihood of having other disabilities .",
    "the degree of a variable reflects the number of disabilities that are not conditionally independent of this variable given the others.=-1    in the observed variables space we quantify the relative importance of a  variable @xmath220 as the sum of the cramr s v associations @xmath243 between @xmath220 and some other variable @xmath221 .",
    "when computing these cumulative cramr s  v associations we assume that the @xmath349 pairwise associations with a  bayes factor below @xmath347 are set to zero .",
    "figure [ fig : degreenltcs ] shows the posterior expected degrees of the @xmath1 disability measures plotted against the corresponding cumulative cramr s v associations .",
    "we see that iadl4 ( cooking ) and iadl10 ( telephoning ) stand out in the latent space .",
    "most individuals included in the survey ( @xmath350 ) are unable to cook , hence , there is no surprise that iadl4 is the second most connected variable .",
    "however , only a relatively small number of people ( @xmath351 ) can not use the telephone on their own .",
    "in fact , more people are disabled with respect to any of the other @xmath275 measures . as such",
    ", it might be counterintuitive to see that iadl10 has the highest degree of connectivity . in the observed variables space the top three cumulative cramr s  v associations are obtained for iadl1 , iadl2 and iadl3 .",
    "we note that iadl1 ( doing heavy house work ) and iadl2 ( doing light house work ) are nested , hence , we would expect their association scores to be related .",
    "this indicates a good degree of consistency of the dependency structure identified by the cggms .",
    "since iadl1 is also highly connected in the latent space , figure [ fig : degreenltcs ] suggests that iadl1 is key to a principled assessment of the disability level of a person .",
    "the cggms clearly show that the @xmath1 disability measures recorded in the nltcs data should not be treated on an equal footing .",
    "some measures such as iadl1 or iadl10 indicate more serious disabilities than others , which is not necessarily reflected in the number of people reporting that particular disability .",
    "simply counting the number of disabilities a person has can be very misleading when evaluating the overall disability level of an individual .",
    "this remark could shed a new light on the findings reported in @xcite who only make the distinction between adls and iadls .",
    "the inference approach we presented in this paper extends gaussian graphical models to data sets in which the multivariate normal assumption for the observed variables is unlikely to hold .",
    "the cggms capture conditional independence relationships among a set of latent variables that are in a one - to - one relationship with the set of observed variables .",
    "the fact that the number of latent variables coincides with the number of observed variables avoids the difficult statistical issue of having to select the number of latent classes  see the excellent discussions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our goal was to model dependencies separately from the univariate marginal distribution of each variable .",
    "as such , we did not include a parametric representation of the marginal distributions in our framework .",
    "@xcite give a bayesian approach to model conditional independence relationships in gaussian copulas in which the univariate marginal distributions are allowed to depend on a set of parameters and on certain sets of explanatory variables .",
    "there is a definite possibility to combine our prior specification for the precision matrix for the latent variables with the methods of @xcite into a procedure that takes into account the uncertainty in the specification of the univariate distributions .",
    "the cggms are applicable to any observational study for the purpose of identifying conditional independence relationships .",
    "the only requirement is that the observed variables are binary , ordinal or continuous .",
    "the extended rank likelihood [ @xcite ] is a key component of our framework .",
    "a necessary condition for its correct application is that there exists an ordering of the possible values of any observed variable  see section [ sec : ordcar ] .",
    "our framework does not allow the presence of discrete variables that are not binary or ordinal .",
    "although the interactions among the latent variables do not go beyond second - order moments , cggms give sensible results in the analysis of sparse contingency tables because they allow inference through bayesian model averaging .",
    "by contrast , log - linear models contain higher - order interaction terms but model averaging is no longer an option : the same interaction term has a different interpretation in various log - linear models . as such",
    ", one has to choose one log - linear model and perform inference given this single model .",
    "when the sample size is small with respect to the total number of possible models , such a determination might not be appropriate .",
    "the data might not contain enough information to distinguish between log - linear models that are very close to each other and have almost the same posterior probability  see , for example , the analysis of the rochdale data from @xcite .",
    "our use of cggms does not involve choosing one particular model , but averaging with respect to many models on the latent space .",
