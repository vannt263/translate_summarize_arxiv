    "in this section , we briefly recall the theoretical framework of the tdhf theory @xcite . in tdhf , the many - body wave function of the system is expressed as a single slater determinant for all times , @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is the total number of nucleons in the system , and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) denotes the single - particle orbitals of the @xmath37th nucleon .",

    "the initial state for tdhf calculations is taken as a product of slater determinants for hartree - fock ( hf ) ground states of projectile and target nuclei boosted with a relative velocity .",
    "the relative velocity is evaluated assuming the rutherford trajectory . by solving the tdhf equations ( [ eq : tdhf ] ) with this initial wave function , the whole reaction dynamics , _",
    "e.g. _ , energy dissipation , nucleon transfer , neck formation , qf or fusion , is described in real - space and real - time , from nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we note that in tdhf calculations for heavy - ion reactions outlined above , neither adjustable parameters nor empirical assumptions on the dynamics are introduced .",

    "fig : experiment ] ) .",
    "the lightest system , ni@xmath44pb , can still undergo fusion leading to isotopes of the element darmstadtium  @xcite .",

    "two stages of the reaction process are especially revealed by the behavior of tkel and interaction times . the first stage ( @xmath47 ) is characterized by a steep increase of these values , meaning that a large amount of energy is dissipated which consumes a lot of time but only a small number of nucleons are transferred .",

    "tkel was evaluated from the center - of - mass motion of the fragments  @xcite . the contact time is defined as the time duration during which the lowest density between two colliding nuclei exceeds a half of the nuclear saturation density , 0.08  @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "let us first focus on the cases where the average number of transferred nucleons is small , a few percent of the total number of nucleons of the system .",
    "they correspond to ( quasi)elastic and grazing reactions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdhf ] , the tdhf results exhibit a prominent increase of tkel up to 2035% of @xmath43 and of contact time up to about 1zs .",
    "this trend is common for all systems examined here .",
    "after the rapid increase , tkel is saturated , meaning that the available energy is fully transferred from the relative motion to internal degrees of freedom .",
    "note that for @xmath5ca+@xmath6sn ( purple squares and gray asterisks ) with a relatively small charge product ( @xmath60=1000 ) the results end before the tkel saturation since the system fused easily at smaller impact parameters .",
    "the tdhf results indicate that full energy dissipation is quickly achieved at the first stage of the reaction .",
    "next let us look at the cases where the average number of transferred nucleons is greater than a few percent of the total number of nucleons of the system .",
    "they correspond to trajectories at smaller impact parameters . in such cases ,",
    "a dinuclear system connected with a thick neck is formed in the course of the collision and its shape evolution dynamics is responsible for the amount of nucleon transfer .",
    "as the impact parameter decreases , two nuclei collide more deeply , forming a more compact system connected with a thicker neck .",
    "it makes the contact time longer and the system evolves more towards the mass symmetry .",
    "it results in the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdhf ]  ( b ) that indicates a correlation between the amount of mass transfer and the contact time . in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : tdhf ]  ( a ) shows a tendency that the tkel decreases as the number of transferred nucleons increases ( @xmath61% ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that a larger mass transfer means also a larger proton transfer in this qf regime . as the number of transferred protons increases , the charge product of the fragments increases , which results in larger kinetic energy and , thus , smaller tkel .",
    "the tdhf results indicate that , in the second stage of the reaction , a large number of nucleons are collectively transferred via shape ( mean - field ) evolution dynamics in the composite system .",
    "it is worth noting here similarities and differences of the tdhf results for different systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdhf ]  ( a ) , it is shown that the saturated values of tkel for @xmath7ca+@xmath3pb , @xmath8ni+@xmath3pb , and @xmath0ni+@xmath4u ( @xmath48-direction , blue open triangles ) are very similar to each other , about 25% of @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the tkel saturates at larger values , about 3035% of @xmath43 , for @xmath7ar+@xmath3pb , @xmath9xe+@xmath10pt , and @xmath0ni+@xmath4u ( @xmath24- and @xmath25-direction , red circles and green crosses ) reactions . in the latter case ,",
    "the significance of nuclear orientations has been pointed out  @xcite .",
    "we note that the @xmath25-direction case ( close to side collisions ) results in larger energy dissipation compared with the @xmath24-direction case ( close to tip collisions ) , for which one may expect the opposite trend since the barrier height is higher in the side collisions .",
    "significant roles of the shape evolution dynamics and shell effects of @xmath3pb in those damped collisions were extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the @xmath7ar+@xmath3pb and @xmath9xe+@xmath10pt reactions ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different . in this case , the collision energy is larger compared with the other cases ( @xmath49@xmath521.37 and 1.19 , respectively ) . because of this fact , a larger amount of energy is brought into the system that leads to a larger maximum value of tkel ( note also that in the @xmath9xe+@xmath10pt reaction no fusion reaction was observed and larger tkel is achieved at smaller impact parameters ) .",
    "moreover , we observed several fusion - fission like processes in the @xmath7ar+@xmath3pb reaction where the composite system splits in an almost symmetric way after a long contact time ( @xmath62  zs ) which resulted in @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdhf ] , because of the large angular momentum brought into the system .    here ,",
    "let us make a possible comparison between the tdhf results and the experimental data . as mentioned above",
    ", the tdhf results correspond to contributions from main ( most probable ) trajectories with various scattering angles associated with different impact parameters . whereas the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experiment ] were obtained by measurements for a fixed angular range : @xmath64=@xmath65 ) degrees ( for ni+pb and xe+pb ) and ( @xmath66 ) degrees ( for u+u ) .",

    "in central collisions , two nuclei must collide deeply forming a dinuclear system .",

    ", we find different tkel values at saturation : in the former case it is about 25% of @xmath43 , while in the latter case it is about 4550% of @xmath43 .",

    "about 11.2 neutrons and 6.6 protons are transferred on average from tip - aligned @xmath4u to the other , consistent with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the other reason is due to a ternary qf process observed in the tip - on - tip collision . in the latter case , an extremely long (",

    "the observed similarities indicate that a significant time delay may still occur even in the heaviest accessible system u@xmath44u .    to understand the observed behavior , we have carried out a comparative study between results of tdhf calculations for various systems [ @xmath7ca+@xmath6sn ( @xmath43=129  mev ) , @xmath16ca+@xmath6sn ( @xmath43=125  mev ) , @xmath7ca+@xmath3pb ( @xmath43= 209  mev ) , @xmath7ar+@xmath3pb ( @xmath43=218  mev ) , @xmath8ni+@xmath3pb ( @xmath43=257  mev ) , @xmath0ni+@xmath4u ( @xmath43=307  mev ) , @xmath9xe+@xmath10pt ( @xmath43=484  mev ) , and @xmath4u+ @xmath4u ( @xmath43=875  mev ) ] and the experimental data . from the results of the tdhf calculations for different systems , we have found similar trends as observed in the experimental data .",
    "the tdhf results have revealed occurrence of two distinct transfer mechanisms . in the grazing regime",
    ", a small number of nucleons are transferred through a fast charge equilibration process . at this stage substantial energy dissipation ( tkel/@xmath84@xmath832035% )",
    "takes place in a relatively short period ( about 12  zs ) and available kinetic energy is fully dissipated .",
    "this represents a rapid transition from quasi - elastic to deep - inelastic and qf regimes . as the impact parameter decreases , two nuclei collide",
    "more deeply forming a dinuclear system connected with a thick neck . in the latter case shape evolution dynamics of the composite system",
    "is responsible for the amount of nucleon transfer .",
    "a large number of nucleons are effectively transferred via the shape evolution dynamics , while all kinetic energy is already fully dissipated .",
    "tdhf calculations were also performed for head - on collisions of @xmath4u+ @xmath4u ( @xmath43=875  mev ) with three orientations , _",
    "i.e. _ , tip - on - tip , tip - on - side , and side - on - side collisions .",
    "the results of tkel and contact time are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data . in the tip - on - tip collision , we have observed a ternary qf process , where a small third fragment is generated from the neck region between two heavy nuclei . in the tip - on - side collision , the broken reflection symmetry allows the composite system to split in an asymmetric way , resulting in transfer of many nucleons from tip - aligned @xmath4u to the other .",
    "moreover , the balian - vnroni variational principle was applied to investigate the variance of the fragment masses in the u+u system , showing significant improvement compared with tdhf .    a careful observation of the experimental data revealed striking similarities between ni@xmath44pb and u@xmath44u systems that the slope change of tkel and interaction times occurs always after the net transfer of about 5% of the total number of nucleons .",
    "we could not yet draw a conclusion if a physical meaning is behind or it is just by chance .",
    "we consider that further analyses of different reactions measured at ship or vamos will provide useful information , which we leave as a future task .",
    "it has been shown that the microscopic tdhf theory can be a promising tool to investigate the qf dynamics in heavy and superheavy systems .",
    "the theory provides valuable insight into the complex qf dynamics from nucleonic degrees of freedom , thus , taking into account shell effects during the collision process .",
    "recently , it has been suggested , based on the langevin model , that multinucleon transfer and qf processes are useful to produce neutron - rich ( super)heavy nuclei which have not been produced to date , where shell effects are predicted to play an important role ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", tdhf can also describe the predicted shell - effect driven transfer processes , and an extensive analysis is in progress @xcite .",
    "last but not least , there is an open problem that how and to what extent the pairing correlations affect the reaction dynamics in damped collisions of heavy nuclei . the so - called time - dependent superfluid local density approximation ( tdslda ) ( or time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory , tdhfb ) would provide a satisfactory answer to it , although it requires about 1001000 times larger computational cost compared with that for the tdhf calculation .",
    "very recently , it has become possible to perform 3d tdslda calculations for nuclear systems using leadership - class supercomputers with hundreds of gpus @xcite .",
    "on one hand , pairing effects should disappear as the excitation energy increases , on the other hand the additional degrees of freedom associated with complex pairing field dynamics may still alter the qf timescale in a similar way as observed in @xmath85pu induced fission process @xcite .",
    "a study along this line is in progress @xcite , and the results will be published elsewhere .",
