    "since the pioneering paper by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , the @xmath0 model is considered the classical example of discrete spin system exhibiting phase transitions mediated by the formation and the interaction of topological singularities . even at zero temperature",
    "the model presents interesting features : depending on the energy regime , the geometry of the ground states is very rich , going from uniform to disordered states , all the way through isolated vortex singularities and clustered dipoles .",
    "both topology and energy concentration take place at different length scales , thus making the analysis fascinating and popular also in the mathematical community .",
    "in this paper we focus on the variational analysis of a two dimensional modified @xmath0 model at zero temperature , describing the formation of fractional vortices and string defects .",
    "our main motivation comes from observing that this kind of singularities characterizes several discrete systems in physics and materials science such as disclinations and string defects in liquid crystals @xcite , fractional vortices and domain walls in micromagnetics @xcite , partial dislocations and stacking faults in crystal plasticity @xcite .",
    "we do not focus on the specific details of any of such models , rather we aim at providing a simple variational model highlighting some of their relevant common features .    given a bounded open set @xmath3 ,",
    "the classical @xmath0 energy on the lattice @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where the sum is taken over pairs of nearest neighbors @xmath6 ; i.e. , @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the spin field . by writing @xmath10 ,",
    "the @xmath0 energy can be rewritten - up to constants - as @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "the rigorous upscaling as @xmath13 of the @xmath14 functional - and more in general of discrete spin systems governed by @xmath15-periodic potentials @xmath16 - has been recently obtained in @xcite in terms of @xmath2-convergence .",
    "loosely speaking , configurations with energy of order @xmath17 exhibit a finite number ( controlled by the pre - factor @xmath18 ) of vortex - like singularities . around each singularity",
    "the order parameter @xmath19 looks like a fixed rotation of the map @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the degree of the singularity .",
    "there the energy concentrates and blows up as @xmath22 .",
    "this analysis is then refined exploiting the next lower order term in the energy expansion .",
    "indeed , after removing the logarithmic leading order contribution , a finite interaction energy , referred to as _ renormalized energy _ , remains .",
    "the renormalized energy depends on the positions and the degrees of the vortices , and it is considered the main driving force responsible for their dynamics @xcite . the strategy adopted to analyze the @xmath0 model exploits methods and tools from the earlier analysis developed for the continuous ginzburg - landau functionals @xcite .",
    "moreover , these techniques have been successfully used to understand in terms of @xmath2-convergence the well - known analogy between vortices in the @xmath0 model and in superconductivity , and screw dislocations in anti - plane linearized elasticity @xcite .    to some extent",
    ", this analogy extends _ mutatis mutandis _ to many other topological defects in liquid crystals , micromagnetics and crystal plasticity .",
    "let us introduce and motivate our model using the language of planar uniaxial nematics .",
    "in the oseen - frank and ericksen picture , nematics are described by a vector field @xmath23 , the _ director _ , that ( in two dimensions ) takes values in @xmath24 .",
    "the molecules are supposed to interact via an elastic potential depending only on their orientation @xmath25 .",
    "if the nematic molecules present _ head - to - tail symmetry _ , the interaction potential is @xmath26-periodic . therefore there is a clear identification between a @xmath27-dimensional nematic lattice model and the @xmath0 spin model .",
    "doubling the phase variable @xmath25 of the director , the interaction potential becomes @xmath15-periodic so that the nematic energy can be written as in with @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to the lebwohl and lasher functional ( @xcite ) recently studied by @xmath2-convergence in @xcite . since in the classical @xmath0 model",
    "integer vortices appear , as result of the identification @xmath28 , for liquid crystals the relevant topological singularities are half vortices , namely the disclinations .",
    "the presence of half vortices is related to orientability issues of the director , that can be better described and visualized in a continuous framework : in a configuration consisting of two half vortices , the director field can not be smooth everywhere . indeed , it has antipodal orientations on the two sides of a line joining the half vortices . according to @xcite",
    ", we call this kind of discontinuity lines _ string defects _ ( see figure [ fig : dipoles ] )",
    ". a first rigorous study of orientability issues related to the presence of half vortices can be found in @xcite , while the right space to describe discontinuous directors has been very recently identified in @xcite as a suitable subspace of @xmath29 , the space of _ special functions with bounded variation_.     in the left picture and @xmath30 in right one ) .",
    "the shaded regions highlight necessary antipodal spins forming the string defects . ]",
    "( 0,0 )    in this paper we provide a quantitative analysis of such orientability issues , by introducing energy functionals which describe both half , and in fact fractional vortices , and string defects . to this end",
    ", we propose a modified @xmath0 model , that draws back to @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath15-periodic potentials , acting on nearest neighbors , and having @xmath31 wells in @xmath32 ; in one well the potential is zero , while in the remaining @xmath33 it is positive but vanishing as @xmath34 goes to zero . in this way",
    ", we model systems with one symmetry , and @xmath33 vanishing asymmetries . the case @xmath35 provides a simple toy model for liquid crystals with small head - to - tail asymmetry , like those made of non centrosymmetric or chiral molecules @xcite .    more specifically , we consider potentials @xmath36 with @xmath33 wells of order @xmath34 ( see figure [ pot ] )",
    ".    having @xmath37 wells in the potential produces fractional vortices of degree @xmath38 , while the additional energy due to the weighted @xmath33 wells yields , together with the renormalized energy , a new term in the limit , depending on the length of the string defects .",
    "the specific @xmath34-scaling of the wells makes finite the string defect energy , and hence of the same order of the renormalized energy .",
    "other scalings could be considered , leading to different limit theories .",
    "let us describe our model and results in more details .",
    "given a discrete director field configuration @xmath39 , we introduce the modified @xmath0 energy functional    @xmath40    we show that configurations @xmath39 with @xmath41 are consistent with the formation of @xmath42 fractional vortices at @xmath43 having degrees @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , up to a subsequence , @xmath44 strongly converges in @xmath45 to some unitary field @xmath46 belonging to @xmath47 with @xmath48 . indeed in theorem [ mainthm ]",
    "we prove that the functionals @xmath49 @xmath2-converge to the limit energy @xmath50 given by @xmath51 here @xmath52 represents the renormalized energy ; it depends on the positions and signs of the fractional vortices , but also on the excess energy due to unneeded oscillations of @xmath46 ; indeed , minimizing @xmath52 with respect to all director fields @xmath46 compatible with the given configuration of fractional vortices gives back the classical renormalized energy for vortices in superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath53 is a core energy stored around each singularity , and has memory of the discrete lattice structure .",
    "the third addendum is the anisotropic length of the string , reminiscent of the lattice symmetries .",
    "we note that the analysis by @xmath2-convergence of discrete functionals leading to such anisotropic interfacial energies is a well established research field @xcite . on the other hand , limit energies as in",
    "may appear also as @xmath2-limits of continuous ginzburg - landau type functionals .",
    "actually , in @xcite the authors propose and study a variant of the standard ginzburg - landau energy , that could be seen as a continuous counterpart of our modified @xmath0 model .",
    "we remark that our @xmath2-convergence result can be considered the first step towards the study of the joint dynamics of strings and vortices , as well as partial dislocations and stacking faults .",
    "we expect that the competition between the surface and the renormalized energies generates non - trivial metastable configurations . as a matter of fact , neglecting boundary effects , two equally charged vortices - in the classical @xmath0 model - repel each other with a force proportional to the inverse of their distance , so that they are never in equilibrium .",
    "on the other hand , since in the generalized @xmath0 model the surface term diverges with the distance between the vortices , there exists a critical length at which the two forces balance and equilibrium is reached . in this respect",
    ", it seems interesting to investigate the dynamics of strings and fractional vortices driven by the limit energy functional @xmath54 , through both rigorous mathematical analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "here we list some preliminaries on @xmath55 and @xmath29 functions that will be useful in the following .",
