    "a generating function @xmath2 defines a sequence of hankel matrices @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an @xmath5 by @xmath5 matrix with entries @xmath6 .",
    "hankel determinants are determinants of these matrices .",
    "traditionally , @xmath7 is defined to be the empty matrix with determinant @xmath8 .    in the year of 2000 , somos @xcite considered the fundamental equation @xmath0 .",
    "he observed that three types of expansions give nice hankel determinants .",
    "the first one is by expanding @xmath9 as a series in @xmath10 , which gives the generating function for catalan numbers ; the second one is by expanding @xmath9 as a series in @xmath11 , which gives a generating function related to catalan and motzkin numbers ; the third one is by expanding @xmath11 as a series in @xmath10 , which gives the generating function for ternary trees .",
    "the first case was known by shapiro @xcite , the third case was proved independently in @xcite , and the second case , known as the _ somos-4 conjecture _",
    ", is still open .",
    "the somos-4 conjecture can be restated as follows .",
    "expanding @xmath9 as a series in @xmath11 gives @xmath12 let @xmath13 and let @xmath14 .",
    "the hankel determinants @xmath15 defined above satisfy the recursion @xmath16 with initial conditions @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 our main objective in this paper is to prove the above conjecture .",
    "there are many classical tools of continued fractions for evaluating hankel determinants , such as the @xmath19-fractions in krattenthaler @xcite or wall @xcite and the @xmath20-fractions in jones and thron ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.2 ) .",
    "our tool is by sulanke and xin s quadratic transformation for hankel determinants @xcite developed from the continued fraction method of gessel and xin @xcite .",
    "proposition 4.1 of @xcite defines a quadratic transformation @xmath21 , and asserts that for certain generating function @xmath22 , we can find @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a constant and @xmath26 is a nonnegative integer .",
    "see @xcite for detailed information .",
    "here we only need the following special case .",
    "it is straightforward to represent @xmath36 as the unique power series solution of @xmath37 therefore we shall set @xmath38 by lemma [ l - transform ] , one can deduce that @xmath39 .",
    "this transforms the recursion for @xmath15 to that for @xmath40 as follows : @xmath41 we remark that the above recursion implies that @xmath42 , which holds for the somos-4 sequence .",
    "it is a surprise that the recursion system can be solved for arbitrary initial condition . for simplicity ,",
    "we write @xmath43 and assume @xmath44 ( otherwise start with @xmath45 ) .",
    "our solution can be stated as follows .",
    "we shall try to write everything in terms of the @xmath25 s .",
    "using , we can replace @xmath49 with @xmath50 everywhere .",
    "therefore becomes @xmath51 substituting into and simplifying gives @xmath52 which can be written as @xmath53 that is to say @xmath54          recall that we have transformed the recursion to , which can be written as @xmath62 by applying ( with @xmath5 replaced by @xmath63 ) and simplifying , the above equation becomes @xmath64 denote by @xmath65 the left - hand side of the above equation .",
    "we claim that @xmath66 for all @xmath5 , so that holds and the conjecture follows .",
    "we prove the claim by induction on @xmath5 .",
    "the claim is easily checked to be true for @xmath67 .",
