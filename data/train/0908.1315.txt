    "biological ion channels are amazing nanofluidic devices .",
    "ion channels are special proteins with pores through the center that allow for passive transport of ions , such as k@xmath0 and na@xmath0 , along their electrochemical gradients , through a membrane formed by a lipid bilayer .",
    "the pores of these proteins have a diameter of order a few ngstroms and , in general , have a charge of their own .",
    "ion channels have two important functions : ( i ) they can open and close the pore and thereby control the current through the channel .",
    "this phenomenon is called gating . (",
    "ii ) typically , they can select the type of ions that can pass through the pore , a phenomenon called selectivity .",
    "selectivity can occur with respect to several properties .",
    "some channels can select divalent ions over monovalent ones .",
    "other channels can distinguish ions of the same valency by size .",
    "using gating and selectivity , ion channels are responsible for a wide range of physiological phenomena such as the regulation of ion concentrations inside the cell @xcite .",
    "the selectivity with respect to ions of equal electrical charge ( e.g. , between k@xmath0 and na@xmath0 ) is rather puzzling .",
    "recent theoretical studies of ion channels with wide pores , such as the l - type ca channel , examined the effects of entropy ( also referred to as molecular crowding ) in the three component mixture composed of neutral solvent molecules and two ion species , which differ only in size , and also studied the influence of the electrostatic attraction of the ions into the channel @xcite .",
    "it was found that the entropic effects can dominate over the electrostatic attractions .",
    "the theories used in these studies were ( i ) equilibrium density functional theory ( dft ) for mixtures of hard spheres in an external field and ( ii ) bulk fluid models of charged hard spheres , in which the external potentials are mapped on to shifts in the chemical potentials of the different components @xcite .    in recent years ,",
    "colloidal suspensions have become popular model systems for testing all aspects of liquid state theory , including dft .",
    "in contrast to atomic or molecular fluids , colloidal suspensions can conveniently be studied optically , e.g. , by confocal microscopy .",
    "in addition , individual or groups of colloids can be manipulated using optics : particles which are optically denser than the surrounding solvent are attracted to regions of higher light intensity , e.g , to a laser focus .",
    "this is the working principle of optical tweezers , which allows for the creation of an attractive potential well for the colloids , by means of laser irradiation .",
    "because of this ability to manipulate and observe the individual colloids , we believe that , as has been the case for other liquid state phenomena , colloidal suspensions provide a useful model system in which to understand how selectivity in some ion channels occurs .",
    "thus , although the present study is motivated by the desire to further understand entropy driven selectivity in ion channels , we consider a more general scenario .",
    "using an accurate dft , we study equilibrium selectivity and using dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) we study the dynamics of selectivity in colloidal binary mixtures .    dynamical aspects of selectivity have neither been studied experimentally nor theoretically , up to now .",
    "while a microscopic dynamical theory for so - called ` simple ' liquids is still under construction @xcite , the ddft for brownian particles ( i.e.  for colloidal suspensions ) @xcite has been applied with success to a large number of situations , ranging from phase separation @xcite and spinodal decomposition @xcite to the micro - rheology of colloid polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "we consider a binary colloidal mixture confined in a three - dimensional slit pore of width @xmath1 . in the center of the slit pore an attractive or repulsive external potential @xmath2 acts on the particles .",
    "this external potential can lead to selectivity of one species of particle over the other in this region of the slit . ]    here , we use ddft to study the dynamics of selectivity in a binary colloidal mixture of particles of two different sizes .",
    "we consider the situation where the mixture is confined within a three - dimensional slit pore , where , apart from the usual fluid ordering near the walls of the slit , the equilibrium fluid is homogeneously distributed within the slit . at time @xmath3 , we switch on an external potential in the center of the channel ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) and then follow the time evolution of the system using ddft .",
    "we select this configuration since it may be realized experimentally in a straightforward manner , by using laser tweezers to create the external potentials .",

    "the difference is due to our treatment of the chemical potentials as lagrange multipliers to set the adsorptions in eq .",

    "this is an example of big - particle selectivity .              in order to better understand the behavior of the system , we study the time evolution of the density profiles of both types of particles as they evolve between the two equilibrium states shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : big ] , the case where the repulsive potentials are exerted in the center of the slit . in",
    "what follows , all times @xmath111 are given in units of the brownian time - scale @xmath112 ; it is roughly the time it takes for a particle to diffuse over a distance equal to its own radius .",
    "note also that we have set the two mobility coefficients to be equal , @xmath113 . in a colloidal suspension",
    "this would not be the case : the mobility of spherical particles in a suspension decreases with the inverse of the cross - sectional area .",
    "for the systems under consideration here this results in @xmath114 . with the small particles being considerably faster than the big ones , the initial behavior of the big particles described in the following might not be observable in colloidal suspension .",
    "the initial conditions for attractive and repulsive potentials in the center of the slit pore are those displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : small](a ) and [ fig : big](a ) , respectively .    in the first case ,",
    "when we switch on the attractive potentials in the center of the slit at time @xmath115 , initially both types of particles behave as one would intuitively expect : they follow the attraction and move towards the center of the slit .",
    "however , this is only the case for short times .",
    "this initial influx of particles results in a slight increase in the particle densities at the center of the slit , as can be seen in the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_ddft ] . for times",
    "@xmath116 , the drift diffusion behavior of the system qualitatively changes , as the competition between the energy due to the interactions of the spheres with the external potentials and the entropy due to the hard - sphere interactions between particles , sets in . for times",
    "@xmath116 , only the small particles follow the attraction and the number density of the small particles in the center of the slit increases further , while the big spheres are expelled from this region . at short times , only spheres in the center of the slit show a net movement and the density profiles do not change over time in the vicinity of the slit walls .",
    "however , at longer times , there is a net flux of the small particles from the walls of the slit towards the center and there is also a net flux of big particles from the center towards the walls .",
    "this diffusion process is slow and the time it takes for the system to reach the final equilibrium state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : small](b ) is rather long .",
    "it also depends on the system size  the wider the slit , the longer it takes for the particles to diffuse ( say ) from the wall to the center .",
    "we observe similar behavior in the case when we apply repulsive potentials at the center of the slit .",
    "when we switch on the repulsive potentials at @xmath115 , both types of particles behave as our intuition suggests , and they follow the repulsion and move way from the center of the slit .",
    "this initial flow results in a slight decrease in the particle densities at the center of the slit , as can be seen in the density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : big_ddft ] .",
    "however , for longer times @xmath116 , the behavior of the system qualitatively changes , as the competition between the energy and the entropy sets in . for times",
    "@xmath116 , only the small particles follow the repulsion and the number density of the small particles in the center of the slit decreases further , while the big spheres become effectively attracted towards this region , and the density of the big particles increases at the center of the slit .",
    "the final equilibrium state the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : big](b ) .",
    "note that these counterintuitive results occur only when the densities of the particles are high enough . at low densities ,",
    "when the system can be modelled as an ideal - gas , attractive potentials always lead to an increase in the densities of both types of particles and repulsive potentials always lead to a decrease .",
    "using the bulk approach depicted in fig .  [ fig : system ] and expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ mu ] ) it is possible to understand the results presented in sec .",
    "[ resultssec ] .",
    "if the external potentials @xmath55 are the same for all components of the mixture , as assumed in our dft and ddft calculations , we can reproduce the increase or decrease of the particle densities in the region where the external potentials are applied : for a binary mixture with size ratio @xmath117 and bulk packing fractions of @xmath77 in the reservoir system  1 ( corresponding to @xmath118 ) and an attractive external potential of magnitude @xmath119 , the density of the small particles in system  2 increases by a factor of 1.91 , while the density of the big particles is reduced to 0.008 of its original value .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : small ] : the density of the big particles at the center of the slit pore is negligibly small while the density of the small particles at the same spot is about twice the reservoir density . in the case of a repulsive potential of magnitude @xmath119 ,",
    "the density of the big particles increases by a factor of 2.25 , while the density of the small spheres is reduced to 0.21 of its value without the field .",
    "again , this agrees rather well with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : big ] .",
    "while we have shown results for size selectivity only for one size ratio , i.e. @xmath117 , we have confirmed that a binary mixture with less asymmetric radii shows analogous behavior .",
    "however , in the case of a less asymmetric size ratio , the amplitude of the attractive or repulsive potential has to be larger to generate a degree of size selectivity similar to that reported in our study .",
    "in addition , eqs .",
    "( [ mu ] ) allows one to easily estimate the influence of the external potentials in other scenarios and determine at what densities the system should or should not display selectivity .",
    "for example , if the external potentials are proportional to the volume of the particles , which would be the case in an experimental realization using laser tweezers , then one should expect results similar to those reported here , for a binary mixture with a size ratio @xmath117 and packing fractions @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in this case , external fields on the order of @xmath122 and @xmath123 are sufficient to generate selectivity .    in the present study ,",
    "the relatively wide slit geometry has only a small effect on the selectivity observed .",
    "however , for more narrow pores , the grand canonical calculations in a cylindrical channel geometry in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the confinement can enhance the selectivity .",
    "the arguments presented above are based purely on the equilibrium free energy and hold for any type of underlying dynamics , i.e. , for the overdamped brownian dynamics considered here as well as for systems following hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "a key feature of the dynamics of separation presented in figs .  [ fig : small_ddft ] and [ fig : big_ddft ] is that the big particles , although they are finally driven out of the region in which the attractive potential acts and into the region in which the repulsive potential acts , initially follow the direction given by the gradient of the external potential . for figs .",
    "[ fig : small_ddft ] and [ fig : big_ddft ] we assumed equal mobilities for the big and the small particles . in a colloidal suspension this is not be the case ( the mobility of spherical particles in a suspension decreases with the inverse of the cross - sectional area ) and so the initial behaviour of the big particles described above might not be observable in a colloidal suspension .    to conclude , we should remind the reader that the ddft in eq .   that we have used to describe the system ,",
    "does not incorporate hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particles . whilst hydrodynamic interactions do not affect the static properties of the system (",
    "i.e.  the equilibrium dft is still applicable ) , hydrodynamic interactions do have an influence on the dynamical properties of the system .",
    "the influence of hydrodynamic interactions between the particles has been incorporated in the ddft in several ways @xcite .",
    "we believe that extending the present study to include the influence of hydrodynamic interactions would not qualitatively change any of the results that we observe since these only influence the dynamics but not the energetics of the system .",
    "it is the energetics which determine the final equilibrium state , i.e.  whether selectivity can be observed or not .",
    "for the calculation of the time evolution of the density profiles , the gradient of @xmath124 are required in eq .",
    "( [ ddfteq ] ) .",
    "this includes the gradient of the variation of the excess free energy functional @xmath125 . since we employ fmt for the excess free energy , we can make use of the the structure of @xmath125 , given in eqs .",
    "( [ fmt ] ) and ( [ weighted ] ) .",
    "note that in the general , three - dimensional case , the variation of the excess free energy with respect to the density profile of component @xmath8 can be written as @xmath126 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) that the gradient acts solely on the weight functions : @xmath127 although the sum in eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ grad ] ) is over four scalar ( @xmath128 ) and two vector - like ( @xmath129 ) weight functions , one can exploit the relations between the scalar weight functions @xmath130 and the vector - weighted functions @xmath131 .",
    "this allows one to reduce to the sum in eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ grad ] ) to three terms by introducing the auxiliary functions @xmath132 @xmath133 and @xmath134 these functions depend on the particular version of fmt employed .",
    "here we use the white - bear version @xcite .",
    "the slit geometry that we consider in the present study allows us to further simplify the gradient in eq .",
    "( [ grad ] ) . the effective one - dimensional weight functions and their derivatives with respect to @xmath135 are easily calculated . for the volume weight function",
    "we find @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the heaviside step - function .",
