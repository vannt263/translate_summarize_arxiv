    "the propagation of light fields and the resonances of optical cavities in rotating systems have been experimentally and theoretically studied as one of the most basic and interesting problems of electromagnetics in arbitrary accelerated systems @xcite .",
    "many of these investigations have concentrated on rotating ring interferometers and rotating ring cavities because such devices can be applied to optical rotation velocity sensors @xcite .",
    "one of the first suggestions to optically detect rotation rate was given by sagnac in 1913 @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to use the difference in one round - trip time between clockwise ( cw- ) and counter - clockwise ( ccw- ) propagating waves due to rotation in a ring interferometer .",
    "the time difference was experimentally observed as phase difference .",
    "today the measurement of phase difference in ring interferometers has become very precise due to optical fiber technology . on the other hand",
    ", rotation also affects the resonances of optical cavities ( modal structures ) .",
    "the degenerate resonant frequency of a non - rotating ring cavity was split into a doublet by rotation , and the fact was confirmed by the experiments of macek and davis @xcite . the effect of the splitting has becomes the basic principle of the operation of ring laser gyroscopes , which are now used in airplanes , rockets , and ships etc . for autonomous navigation because they are the most precise sensors among any other types of gyroscopes .",
    "so far , the effect of rotation on resonances ( i.e. , frequency splitting induced by rotation ) has been explained as that which originated in the time difference between counter - propagating lights due to rotation . this fact has been derived by a kinematical approach ( ray - optics ) @xcite or by a wave dynamical approach based on the electromagnetic equations of a naturally covariant form ( or general theory of relativity ) @xcite . for such theoretical approaches ,",
    "the following assumptions are explicitly or implicitly used in their derivations : ( i ) the light field one - dimensionally propagates in slender waveguides such as optical fibers or ring cavities composed of more than three mirrors ; ( ii ) the wavelength of the light is much shorter than the sizes of the cavities , i.e. , the geometrical optics approximation is valid enough .",
    "the use of assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) means that resonant modes can be expressed as cw- or ccw- propagating wave modes along a ring trajectory with identical resonant frequencies(i.e .",
    ", degenerate states ) in non - rotating cavities .",
    "recently , advanced semiconductor technologies make it possible to fabricate arbitrary - sized optical cavities @xcite .",
    "when the cavity size becomes smaller , however , it remains unclear whether assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) are still valid and conventional theory based on them really works .",
    "in addition , resonant modes can not always be expressed as counter - propagating waves in microcavities .",
    "we have recently established a wave - dynamical approach to rotating resonant cavities without assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we showed that , when the angular velocity is larger than a certain value , the nearly - degenerate standing wave modes of a non - rotating microcavity change into a pair of counter - propagating wave modes and their frequency difference starts to increase proportionally to the angular velocity @xcite .",
    "it has been revealed that , below the value of the angular velocity , a region exists where the frequency difference almost does not change , suggesting that the existence of this region might be an obstacle in the practical sense when one operates the microcavities as optical gyroscopes .    in this paper , we discuss the relation between the existence of this region and the symmetry of cavity shape and show that designing cavity symmetry as @xmath0 @xmath8 yields degenerate resonant frequencies and can eliminate the region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] , we review the derivation for the shifts of resonant frequencies induced by rotation and the numerical results by a wave - dynamical approach without assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) . it is shown that there exists a region around zero angular velocity where the frequency shifts are almost not caused .",
    "discussions are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , and we propose a method for eliminating the region in sec . [",
    "sec : iv ] . finally , a summary of this paper is provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] .",
    "according to the electromagnetic equations of naturally covariant forms @xcite or general theory of relativity @xcite , electromagnetic fields in a rotating resonant microcavity are subject to the maxwell equations generalized to a non - inertial frame of reference in uniform rotation with angular velocity vector @xmath9 .",
    "we derived the following stationary wave equation from the maxwell equations by assuming that microcavities can be modeled as a waveguide , which is wide in the @xmath10 direction and thin in the @xmath11 direction @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 @xmath16 denotes coordinates in a rotating frame of reference with angular velocity vector @xmath17 .",
    "the cavity is at rest in the rotating frame of reference . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the velocity of the light and a refractive index inside the cavity , and @xmath20 is the wave number .",
    "we also assume that the tm or te waves of the electromagnetic fields oscillate as @xmath21   = ( 0,0,\\psi(\\vec{r})\\exp(-ickt)+c.c)$ ] .",
    "below , we impose the dirichlet boundary condition for simplicity , and resonant modes of rotating cavities can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ fundeq ] ) with two perturbation theories typically used in quantum mechanics .",
    "first , we discuss a case where angular velocity @xmath22 is smaller than the following value @xmath23 : @xmath24 dxdy \\right|^{-1}c\\delta k_0 ,   \\label{ineq}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the domain of the cavity , and @xmath26 is the spacing between adjacent eigenvalues @xmath20 of the wave number for eq .",

    ", we apply the perturbation theory for non - degenerate states to eq .",
    "( [ fundeq ] ) by assuming that , due to cavity rotation , the eigenvalue is shifted as @xmath31 and the wave function is changed as @xmath32 by substituting them to eq .",

    "next we discuss the case where angular velocity is larger than @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath38 . in this case , the perturbation theory used above breaks down because coefficient @xmath39 of resonant mode @xmath40 , which has the adjacent eigenvalue to @xmath41 , is no longer small due to @xmath42 .",
    "instead , we use the perturbation theory for degenerate states . according to the perturbation theory , two nearly - degenerate wavefunctions @xmath29 and @xmath30",

    "we carry out the numerical simulation in a quadrupole cavity defined by boundary @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the parameters of the cavity are set as @xmath49 and the refractive index is @xmath50 , where there is a ring trajectory shown by the dashed line in fig .",

    "( [ fundeq ] ) with @xmath27 yields the wavefunctions of the eigen modes corresponding to the ring trajectory , as shown in figs . [ fig1](a ) and ( b ) . as seen here , these modes are standing waves along the ring trajectory and have different parities with respect to the ( horizontal and vertical ) symmetry axes of the cavity .",
    "in addition , they have slightly different eigenvalues of the wavenumber ; these modes are nearly - degenerate standing waves .",
    "we call the two modes shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) modes a and b , respectively .    when the cavity is rotated but the angular velocity @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath23 ( where @xmath51 ) , the frequency difference between modes a and b does not increase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , and the wavefunctions of modes a and b do not drastically change , and they remain standing waves .",
