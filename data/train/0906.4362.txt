    "iv ) the impossibility of performing continuous measurement without backaction  @xcite , which leads to the problem of synchronizing the detection process with the arrival of the measured field . in a wide sense , the photodetection device has to be passive , being activated irreversibly by the arriving microwave signal . otherwise , the advanced information that a photon is approaching turns itself into a photodetection device .",
