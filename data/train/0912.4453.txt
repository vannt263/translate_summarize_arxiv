    "the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and fermion ( quark and lepton ) mass hierarchy are the two central quests in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) program .",
    "in particular , it is noticeable that the lhc has a potential for discovering the fourth fermion family  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the existence of the latter has been studied for a long time ( for a review , see ref .",
    "it is noticeable that the fourth family can play an important role in b - cp asymmetries phenomena @xcite .",
    "since the mass bounds for the fourth family quarks @xmath2 and @xmath1 are of the order of the ewsb scale  @xcite , the pagels - stokar ( ps ) formula  @xcite suggests that their contributions to the ewsb should not be small .",
    "this leads to an idea of the dynamical ewsb scenario with the fourth family  @xcite , which is an alternative version of the top quark condensate model @xcite .",
    "because the yukawa couplings of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 quarks have the landau pole around several tev scale , it suggests that the higgs doublets @xmath6 and @xmath3 composed of them could be produced without fine tuning .",
    "although the top quark mass is obviously near the ewsb scale , it apparently plays no leading role in the ewsb : the ps formula suggests that its contribution to the ewsb is around 10 - 20% . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath0 quark might play an important role in the dynamics responsible for the quark mass hierarchy .",
    "recently , utilizing dynamics considered in ref .",
    "@xcite quite time ago , we introduced a new class of models in which the top quark plays just such a role @xcite .",
    "the main two features of these models are a ) the presence of strong ( although subcritical ) horizontal diagonal interactions for the @xmath0 quark , and b ) horizontal flavor - changing neutral interactions between different families .",
    "together with the assumption that the dynamics primarily responsible for the ewsb leads to the mass spectrum of quarks with no ( or weak ) isospin violation , and with the masses of the order of the observed masses of the down - type quarks , these features allow to reproduce the quark mass hierarchy and essential characteristics of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "this approach can be implemented in the models with different ewsb scenarios .",
    "its signature is the existence of an additional top - higgs resonance doublet @xmath7 composed of the quarks and antiquarks of the 3rd family , @xmath5 . in the case of the dynamical ewsb scenario with the fourth family ,",
    "the top - higgs @xmath7 is heavier than the @xmath8 and @xmath9 composites @xcite . for simplicity , in ref",
    ".  @xcite we considered only the case when the @xmath7 mass is ultraheavy and it decouples from tev dynamics .",
    "however , in general , this is not the case , and the @xmath7 can be detectable at the lhc .",
    "this leads to a model with three higgs doublets . actually ,",
    "because the @xmath10 composite , and those ones connected with the lighter @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks , are necessarily ultraheavy and decouple in this scenario @xcite , and because there is an approximate @xmath13 symmetry between @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks , it would be appropriate to call it the 2 + 1 composite higgs model . in this paper , we will study such dynamics .",
    "as for the fourth family leptons , we assume that their masses are around 100  gev  @xcite , and thus their contributions to the ewsb are smaller than that of the top quark . for the dynamics with very heavy fourth family leptons , and",
    "thereby with a lepton condensation , one needs to use , say , a five higgs model .",
    "also , the majorana condensation of the right - handed neutrinos should be reanalyzed in that case .",
    "this possibility will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ 2 ] , we describe the model .",
    "the qualitative features of its low energy effective theory are discussed in sec .",
    "[ l - eff ] . in sec .",
    "[ 4 ] , the results of the numerical analysis of the renormalization group equations are presented and the properties of the composite higgs bosons are described .",
    "the structure of the ckm matrix and flavor - changing - neutral interactions are discussed in sec . [ 5 ] . in sec . [ 6 ] , we summarize the main results of the paper . in appendixes a - c ,",
    "useful formulas used in the main text are derived .",
    "we will utilize a nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type model to describe the dynamics with the @xmath16 higgs doublets composed of the third and fourth family quarks .",
    "its lagrangian density has the following form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lagrangian density for the standard model ( sm ) gauge bosons , the fermion kinetic term is @xmath19 and the njl interactions are described by @xmath20 here @xmath21 denotes the weak doublet quarks from the @xmath22-th family , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the right - handed up- and down - type quarks .",
    "it is useful to rewrite this theory in an equivalent form by introducing auxiliary fields , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the following remark is in order .",
    "if we added the yukawa mixing terms , they could be erased by redefining the composite higgs fields .",
    "for example , for the mixing term @xmath32 , the redefinition would be @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "such non - unitary ( but invertible ) transformations are allowed because there are no canonical kinetic terms for the auxiliary fields in @xmath35 .    as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the diagonal parts of the njl interactions , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , can be generated from the topcolor interactions  @xcite . in this case , the scales for the dimensionful njl parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 are connected with the coloron masses , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the mixing term @xmath43 can be generated by a flavor - changing - neutral ( fcn ) interaction , @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath44  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath45 may be connected with topcolor instantons  @xcite . in the 2 + 1 composite higgs model , while the coupling constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 are supercritical and responsible for ewsb , the @xmath0 quark coupling @xmath38 is subcritical , although also strong @xcite .    as to the @xmath46 term , the situation is the following . as far as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , there do not appear nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons even if the @xmath49 term , which is connected with @xmath46 , is ignored .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath50 , the peccei - quinn like @xmath51 symmetry ,    @xmath52    is explicitly broken by the higgs mass mixing term @xmath47 .",
    "( although the mixing term @xmath53 does not break this @xmath51 symmetry , it is important : if both @xmath53 and @xmath49equal zero , a new global @xmath54 symmetry appears . )",
    "therefore , it is safe to take @xmath50 .",
    "because of that , although we will keep the @xmath46 and @xmath49 terms in a general discussion for a while , they will be ignored in the numerical analysis .",
    "the model introduced in the previous section provides an approximate @xmath55 structure in the higgs quartic coupling sector in the low energy effective action . indeed , in the bubble approximation , while the top - higgs @xmath7 couples only to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the composite @xmath58 couples only to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , that leads to such a 2 + 1 structure .",
    "when we turn on the electroweak gauge interactions , this structure breaks down .",
    "the breaking effects are however suppressed , because the yukawa couplings are much larger than the electroweak gauge ones .    in this section",
    ", we analyze the main characteristics of the @xmath55 low energy effective higgs model , in particular , the structure of its vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "we also discuss the relations between the parameters of the initial njl model ( such as the njl couplings , etc . ) and the observable ones .    in order to illustrate main qualitative features of the effective model",
    ", we will employ the bubble approximation in calculating its parameters ( such as yukawa and quartic couplings , etc . ) .",
    "however , the structure of the action will be taken to be more general , based on a numerical analysis of the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) with the compositeness conditions @xcite , which is performed in the next section .",
    "since at low energy the composite higgs fields develop kinetic terms , the lagrangian density of the low energy effective model is @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the higgs potential and @xmath65 are the renormalized higgs fields .",
    "taking into account the renormalization group ( rg ) improved analysis , which will be presented in the next section , we study the following higgs potential : @xmath66 with @xmath67    + \\lambda_t ( \\phi_{t}^\\dagger \\phi_{t})^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are negative , the mass square @xmath70 is positive , which reflects a subcritical dynamics of the @xmath0 quark .",
