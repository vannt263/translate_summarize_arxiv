    "<S> et al . _ [ prl * 112 * , 076403 ( 2014 ) ] reveals significant inaccuracies of the latter .    </S>",
    "<S> the uniform electron gas ( ueg ) , consisting of electrons on a uniform neutralizing background , is one of the most important model systems in physics . besides being a simple model for metals </S>",
    "<S> , the ueg has been central to the development of linear response theory and more sophisticated perturbative treatments of solids , the formulation of the concepts of quasiparticles and elementary excitations , and the remarkable successes of density functional theory .    the practical application of ground - state density functional theory in condensed matter physics , chemistry and materials science rests on a reliable parametrization of the exchange - correlation energy of the ueg @xcite , which in turn is based on accurate quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation data @xcite . however , the charged quantum matter in astrophysical systems such as planet cores and white dwarf atmospheres @xcite is at temperatures way above the ground state , as are inertial confinement fusion targets @xcite , laser - excited solids @xcite , and pressure induced modifications of solids , such as insulator - metal transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this unusual regime , in which strong ionic correlations coexist with electronic quantum effects and partial ionization , has been termed `` warm dense matter '' and is one of the most active frontiers in plasma physics and materials science .    </S>",
    "<S> the warm dense regime is characterized by the existence of two comparable length scales and two comparable energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> the length scales are the mean interparticle distance , @xmath4 , and the bohr radius , @xmath5 ; the energy scales are the thermal energy , @xmath6 , and the electronic fermi energy , @xmath7 . the dimensionless parameters @xcite @xmath8 and @xmath9 are of order unity . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath10 , the use of ground - state density functional theory is inappropriate and extensions to finite @xmath11 are indispensible ; these require accurate exchange - correlation functionals for finite temperatures @xcite . because neither @xmath12 nor @xmath13 is small , there are no small parameters , and weak - coupling expansions beyond hartree - fock    potential energy per particle of the unpolarized ueg at @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the exact cpimc results for different system sizes are indicated by green crosses ; the yellow asterisks show these results after the @xmath16 finite - size correction from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_bcdc ] ) has been applied . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal arrows show the results of various many - body theories ( rpa , stls @xcite , montroll - ward [ mw ] , and @xmath17 [ e4 ] @xcite ; see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black lines are two different , equally plausbile , extrapolations of the qmc data to infinite system size  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    such as the montroll - ward ( mw ) and @xmath17 ( e4 ) approximations  @xcite , as well as linear response theory within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) break down @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finite-@xmath11 singwi - tosi - land - sjlander ( stls ) @xcite local - field corrections allow for an extension to moderate coupling @xcite , but exhibit non - physical behavior at short distances for moderate to low densities . </S>",
    "<S> further , quantum - classical mapping @xcite allows for semi - quantitative descriptions of warm dense matter in limiting cases .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an accurate description of warm dense matter in general and of the warm dense ueg in particular can only be achieved using computational approaches , primarily quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) methods which , however , are hampered by the fermion sign problem @xcite . the pioneering qmc simulations of the warm dense ueg by brown _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite eliminated the sign problem by invoking the ( uncontrolled ) fixed - node approximation  @xcite , but were nevertheless restricted to small systems of @xmath18 ( spin - polarized ) and @xmath19 ( unpolarized ) electrons and to moderate densities , @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we were able to show @xcite that accurate simulations of these systems are possible over a broad parameter range without any nodal restriction . </S>",
    "<S> our approach combines two independent methods , configuration path - integral monte carlo ( cpimc ) @xcite and permutation blocking pimc @xcite , which allow for accurate simulations at high ( @xmath21 ) and moderate densities ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> an independently developed third approach , density matrix qmc @xcite , confirmed the excellent quality of these results . </S>",
    "<S> the only significant errors remaining are finite - size effects @xcite , which arise from the difference between the small systems simulated and the infinite [ thermodynamic limit ( tdl ) ] system of interest .    </S>",
    "<S> direct extrapolation to the tdl @xcite is extremeley costly and also unreliable unless the form of the function to be extrapolated is known ; the two black lines in fig .  [ intro_pic ] show two equally reasonable extrapolations @xcite that reach different limits . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the parameter - free finite - size correction ( fsc ) proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_bcdc ] ) below ) turns out to be inappropriate in parts of the warm dense regime . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is clear from inspection of the yellow asterisks in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ intro_pic ] , which include this fsc but remain system - size dependent .    in this letter , we close the gap between the finite-@xmath24 qmc data and the tdl by deriving a highly accurate fsc for the interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain precise ( on the level of @xmath25 ) results for the exchange - correlation free energy , making possible the _ ab initio _ computation of arbitrary thermodynamic quantities over the entire warm dense regime .    </S>",
    "<S> * theory*. consider a finite unpolarized ueg of @xmath24 electrons subject to periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath24 electrons in the cell and @xmath28 is the coulomb interaction energy per unit cell of an infinite periodic array of images of that cell . the ewald pair potential @xmath29 and madelung constant @xmath30 are defined in refs .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use hartree atomic units throughout this work . </S>",
    "<S> the expected value of @xmath31 carries a finite - size error @xcite that is the difference between the potential energy @xmath32 per electron in the infinite system and its value @xmath33 in the finite system . </S>",
    "<S> this difference may be expressed in terms of the static structure factor ( sf ) as follows : @xmath34}{n } =   \\underbrace { \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{k<\\infty}\\frac{\\textnormal{d}\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\left[s(k)-1\\right]\\frac{4\\pi}{k^2 } } _ { v } \\notag \\\\   \\label{delta_v_1 } & \\hspace*{5em } - \\underbrace { \\left (   \\frac{1}{2l^3}\\sum_{\\mathbf{g}\\ne\\mathbf{0}}\\left[s_n(\\mathbf{g})-1\\right]\\frac{4\\pi}{g^2}+\\xi_\\textnormal{m}\\right ) } _ { v_n / n } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively , the length and reciprocal lattice vector of the simulation cell , @xmath37 [ @xmath38 is the sf of the infinite [ finite ] system . a first source of fs error in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta_v_1 ] ) is the replacement of @xmath37 in the first term by its finite - size analogue @xmath39 in the second term . </S>",
    "<S> however , this effect is negligible , as we will demonstrate in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ main_sk ] .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the main source of error is the discretization of the integral in the first term to obtain the sum in the second term . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , chiesa _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  suggested that the main contribution to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta_v_1 ] ) comes from the omission of the @xmath40 term from the summation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the rpa becomes exact in the limit of small @xmath41 , and the expansion of @xmath37 around @xmath42 at finite @xmath11 is given by  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the inverse temperature and @xmath45 is the plasma frequency . the finite-@xmath11 version of the chiesa fsc  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath46 would be sufficient if : ( i ) @xmath47 were accurate for the smallest nonzero @xmath41 in the qmc simulation , @xmath48 ; and ( ii ) all contributions to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta_v_1 ] ) not accounted for by the inclusion of the @xmath49 term were negligible . </S>",
    "<S> as we demonstrate below , for high temperatures and intermediate to high densities , both conditions are strongly violated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we need to use an improved model sf , @xmath50 , to compute the discretization error , @xmath51 = \\frac{\\delta v_n \\left[s_\\textnormal{model}(k),s_\\textnormal{model}(k)\\right]}{n } , \\label{eq_trial}\\ ] ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta_v_1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a natural strategy is to combine the qmc data for @xmath52 with an approximation that is accurate for all @xmath41 up to ( at least ) @xmath53 .    </S>",

    "<S> panel b ) shows that the qmc results for @xmath37 converge rapidly with @xmath24 ( see the colored symbols in the inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve shows @xmath60 connecting @xmath61 at small @xmath41 with the qmc data for @xmath55 which yields accurate results for all @xmath41 . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    * results*. in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ main_sk ] , we analyze the static sf for @xmath14 and a comparatively high density case , @xmath15 , for three different particle numbers . the use of a finite simulation cell subject to periodic boundary conditions discretizes the momentum , so qmc data are available only at the discrete @xmath41-points indicated by the vertical lines in the top panel . as shown in the inset , the qmc @xmath37 is well converged with respect to system size for surprisingly small @xmath24 , providing justification to set @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the fs error of @xmath33 reduces as @xmath24 increases primarily because the @xmath41-grid becomes finer and @xmath53 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the figure also allows us to study the performance of the three analytical structure factors , @xmath58 , @xmath57 @xcite and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly observe that @xmath47 is only accurate for @xmath63 , explaining why the bcdc fsc , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_bcdc ] ) , fails . </S>",
