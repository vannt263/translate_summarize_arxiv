    "in @xcite , we related two apparently different bases in the representations of affine lie algebras of type @xmath1 : one arising from statistical mechanics , the other from gauge theory .",
    "in particular , using geometric methods associated to quiver varieties , we were able to give an alternative and much simpler geometric proof of a result of @xcite on the construction of bases of affine lie algebra representations .",
    "at the same time , we gave a simple parametrization of the irreducible components of nakajima quiver varieties associated to infinite and cyclic quivers in terms of young and maya diagrams .",
    "in the current paper , we consider the spin representations of the lie algebra @xmath2 of type @xmath3 . applying the techniques of @xcite , we are able to give a very explicit parametrization of the irreducible components of the associated nakajima varieties in terms of young diagrams of strictly decreasing row length with maximum length @xmath4",
    ". we also explicitly compute the geometric action and thus obtain a realization of the spin representations in terms of these diagrams .",
    "furthermore , we are able to extend the geometric action to the entire clifford algebra used in the classical construction of the spin representations .",
    "this is the first example of a geometric realization of additional structure on irreducible representations extending the module structure originally defined by nakajima .",
    "possible extensions of these results to the affine case may suggest new statistical mechanics results for type @xmath0 analogous to those of type @xmath1 mentioned above .    the author would like to thank i. b. frenkel for numerous discussions and helpful suggestions and m. kassabov for pointing out an error in an earlier version of this paper .",
