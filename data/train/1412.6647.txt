    "rogue waves ( rws ) are also known as freak waves , monster waves , killer waves and extreme waves which occasionally appearing in the ocean that can reach the amplitudes more than twice the value of significant wave height @xcite .",
    "a well known description of rw is that it appears from nowhere and disappears without a trace @xcite .",
    "these waves may arise from the instability of a certain class of initial conditions that tend to grow exponentially and thus have the possibility of increasing up to very high amplitudes , due to modulation instability .",
    "it has been found that the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the slowly varying pulse envelope , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the spatial and temporal coordinates respectively , can describe many dynamical features of the rws . even though they are first observed in the ocean recent investigations",
    "have shown that they also arise in optical fibers @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , superfluid helium @xcite , capillary waves @xcite , plasmas @xcite , and so on .    in a variety of complex systems such as optical fibers , bose - einstein condensates , and financial systems , several amplitudes rather than a single one need to be considered .",
    "the resulting systems of coupled equations may thus describe extreme waves with higher accuracy than the scalar nls equation model .",
    "very recently , attempts have been made to construct vector rogue wave solutions of gross - pitaevskii equation and the manakov system .",
    "however , rogue waves in the coupled nls equation with higher order effects such as four - wave mixing effects have not been studied so far .",
    "four - wave mixing is a basic nonlinear phenomenon having fundamental relevance and practical applications , particularly in nonlinear optics , optical processing @xcite , phase conjugate optics @xcite , real time holography @xcite and measurement of atomic energy structures and decay rates .    motivated by this , in this paper",
    ", we characterize the breather and rw solutions of a physically important system , namely coupled generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( cgnls ) system ,    @xmath4    [ pct1 ]    where @xmath5 and @xmath1 are slowly varying pulse envelopes and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are real constants . here",
    "@xmath8 is a complex constant and @xmath9 denotes complex conjugation . physically @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms describe the self phase modulation and cross phase modulation effects respectively .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath10 terms describe the four wave mixing effects .",
    "when @xmath11 and @xmath12 the above equations reduce to the manakov system @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 and @xmath12 they reduce to the mixed coupled nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "although a connection between rw solution and modulation instability of nls equation has been analyzed explicitly , to our knowledge , the connection between rws in the coupled nls equation with higher order effects such as four - wave mixing effects and modulation instability has not been studied so far . in this paper , besides characterizing breather and rw solutions of ( [ pct1 ] ) , we also intend to investigate the effect of four - wave mixing in modulation instability process .",
    "we derive breather and rw solutions of cgnls system ( [ pct1 ] ) using darboux transformation ( dt ) .",
    "dt is one of the powerful methods to construct a class of solutions including , n - soliton solutions ( bright and dark types ) , breathers and rw solutions for the nonlinear integrable evolution equations .",
    "the dt retains the form of linear eigenvalue problem under a specific transformation and generate new solutions from the seed solution . to obtain breather and rw solutions we choose plane wave solution as the seed solution . since the lax pair matrices of ( [ pct1 ] ) is of order @xmath14 , while integrating the lax pair equations we obtain a cubic polynomial equation .",
    "the cubic polynomial may have ( i ) three different roots , ( ii ) one single and one double root and ( iii ) three equal roots .",
    "since the general solution depends on the roots of the characteristic equation , the dynamics comes out from the above three cases also differ from each other . in the first and second cases we obtain breather and rw solution respectively for the eq .",
    "( [ pct1 ] ) . in both the cases we obtain the respective solutions by considering the four wave mixing parameter @xmath8 as a real constant . in the third case",
    "we obtain a trivial solution only .",
    "we then examine the modulation instability of the cgnls system and demonstrate that it can occur when the imaginary part of the four wave mixing parameter @xmath8 should be zero .",
    "from these two results we conclude that the rw can occur only in the regime of modulation instability .",
    "very recently breather and rw solutions have also been obtained for the manakov system .",
    "since cgnls system is a generalization of manakov system we also compare the results obtained in this paper with the manakov equation and point out the differences in the breather and rw solutions that present in these two systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . to begin with , in the following section",
    ", we briefly summarize the results obtained for the equation ( [ pct1 ] ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we construct dt of cgnls system ( [ pct1 ] ) . in section 4",
    ", we derive general breather and rw solutions of cgnls system . in section 5 ,",
    "we investigate modulation instability of cgnls system and point out the connection between rw and modulation instability .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclude our work .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the results obtained on the cgnls system during the past few years .",
    "the cgnls system ( [ pct1 ] ) was first introduced as an completely integrable equation by wang et al @xcite . with the help of riemann - hilbert method",
    "the authors have constructed n - bright soliton solutions for ( [ pct1 ] ) with a condition on system parameters @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "the collision dynamics between two bright solitons and the existence of infinite number of conservation laws are also shown in the same reference @xcite . in a subsequent study l and penj",
    "have carried out painlev@xmath15 singularity structure analysis to this equation and shown that this system passes p - test for arbitrary values of system parameters @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 @xcite . in one of our recent studies , we have constructed dark - dark soliton and general breather solutions for the eq .",
    "( [ pct1 ] ) through hirota s bilinearization method @xcite . by appropriately restricting the parameters which appear in the phase factors in the general breather expression we have derived akhmediev breather , ma soliton and rogue wave solutions @xcite .",
    "we then considered the reverse problem of constructing akhmediev breather , ma soliton and general breather ( gb ) expression from the rw solution . to derive various breather profiles from rw solution we considered the later in a factorized form and generalized this factorized form in an imbricate series expression with certain unknown parameters in it . by substituting this imbricate series in eq .",
    "( [ pct1 ] ) and solving the resultant equations we fixed the unknown parameters . substituting these parameters back in the imbricate series and rewriting it in a compact form we have obtained the desired breather solutions . with three different forms of the imbricate series we have derived the akhmediev breather , ma soliton and general breather solutions from the rw solution @xcite .",
    "we have also studied in - detail how these solution profiles change with respect to four wave mixing terms .",
    "we have demonstrated that when we increase the value of the real value of four wave mixing parameter not only the number of peaks increases in the gb profile but also the direction of the underlying profile gets altered .",
    "when we increase the value of @xmath16 @xmath8 in the ab and ms profiles only the number of peaks increases in them . in the case of rw solution the profile becomes thinner and thinner when we increase the value of @xmath16 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we observed that the value of @xmath17 @xmath8 does not change either the number of pulses or the direction of any of these profiles .    in a follow - up work ,",
    "we have constructed nth order rw solution to cgnls system ( [ pct1 ] ) using generalized darboux transformation ( gdt ) method @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to construct higher order rogue wave solutions using classical dt method since higher order rogue wave solutions do contain only one critical eigenvalue .",
    "it is well known that in the conventional n - fold dt one has n - distinct eigenvalues . through gdt",
    "one can overcome this problem and construct higher order rogue waves with single eigenvalue . using gdt we have derived a recursive formula and presented determinant representations for nth order rw solution of this system . using these representations",
    "we have displayed second order rw solution with two free parameters and the third order rw solution with four free parameters @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the second and third order rw solutions by varying these free parameters and shown that one can obtain certain interesting structures . in the case of second order rw , we have shown that these rws exhibit a triplet pattern and in the case of third order rw solution we have visualized a triangular and hexagonal structures depending upon the restriction on the free parameters @xcite . in continuation of earlier studies , in this work , we aim to investigate the interaction behaviors in nonlinear localized modes such as solitons , breather and rogue wave in the cgnls system .",
