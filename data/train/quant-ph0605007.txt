    "the analytical solution of the radial schrdinger equation is of high importance in non - relativistic quantum mechanics since the wave function contains all the necessary information to describe a quantum system fully .",
    "there are only a few potentials for which the radial schrdinger equation can be solved explicitly for all @xmath1 and all @xmath5 .",
    "so far , many methods such as super - symmetry ( susy ) @xcite , nikiforov - uvarov @xcite , asymptotic iteration method @xcite and the pekeris approximation @xcite have been developed and applied to solve the radial schrdinger equation exactly or quasi - exactly for @xmath6 within a given potential .",
    "the kratzer or modified kratzer type potentials @xcite we consider in this paper have played an important role in the history of the molecular and quantum chemistry and they have been so far extensively used to describe the molecular structure and interactions @xcite . although such central potentials have been extensively used to describe the properties of the system qualitatively , it is known that the dynamical properties of the system should also be taken into account for a better description of the system .",
    "that means , the potential should have not only the radial but also the angle dependent parts .",
    "these dynamical properties of the system can be taken into account by using a non - central potential and therefore , in this paper , we aim to present the effect of the non - central term to calculate the non - zero angular momentum solutions of the schrdinger equation . for this , we take the non - central modified kratzer @xcite potential ( @xmath7 ) and as an application , we calculate the energy eigenvalues of the @xmath3 diatomic molecule for various @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum numbers .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the following two sections , the basic equations of the nikiforov - uvarov method ( nu ) as well as the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) used so far to solve the resulting differential equation are given briefly .",
    "the solutions of the schrdinger equation with the non - central modified kratzer potential are outlined in the fourth section .",
    "then , the solutions of the schrdinger equation with the non - central modified kratzer potential are obtained by using both methods .",
    "the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions are calculated for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum numbers for the @xmath3 diatomic molecule and the effect of the non - central term is determined explicitly by comparing the results with the findings of the modified kratzer potential with different @xmath1 and @xmath5 quantum numbers .",

    "the nu method is based on the solutions of general second order linear equations with special functions .",
    "it has been extensively used to solve the non - relativistic schrdinger equation or similar time - independent second - order differential equations and there is an extensive literature to look at @xcite . however , in order to keep the completeness of the paper , we briefly outline nu method here .",
    "the idea in the nu method is to convert the schrdinger equation or similar differential equations into the following form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are polynomials , at most second - degree , and @xmath11 is a first - degree polynomial @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the analytical solution of a new exactly solvable non - central potential of @xmath0 type , which may be called as the modified non - central kratzer potential . </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenvalues as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions are calculated for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum numbers within the framework of the nikiforov - uvarov and asymtotic iteration methods for the @xmath3 diatomic molecule as an application of this potential . in this paper , we first present the effect of the non - central term on the bound - state energy eigenvalues : this effect is determined explicitly for different @xmath1 and @xmath2 quantum numbers with @xmath4=0.0 , 0.1 , 1.0 and 5.0 values and the results are compared with the findings of the modified kratzer potential for different @xmath1 and @xmath5 quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show that the angle - dependent non - central part behaves like a centrifugal barrier and it reduces the depth of the attractive potential pocket , which effects the bound - state energy eigenvalues . </S>"
