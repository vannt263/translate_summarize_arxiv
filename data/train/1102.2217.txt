    "the discovery of superconducting transition temperature up to @xmath5 k in lafeaso@xmath6f@xmath0 ( 1111-type ) with @xmath7@xcite generated intense activity .",

    "the @xmath10 superconductivity was proposed in which the sign of the order parameter is switched between the two sets of fermi surfaces.@xcite the multi - band electronic structure and the inter - pocket hopping or fermi surface nesting seem to be common ingredients in all iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite however , after more iron - based superconductors have been observed , the consensus is further away.@xcite    recently , a new series of iron - based superconductors a@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , tl ) has been discovered with relatively high @xmath11 k. @xcite these compounds are purely electron - doped and it is found that the superconductivity might be in proximity of a mott insulator.@xcite the low - energy band structure and fermi surface of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 may be different from other iron - based superconductors . only electron pockets were observed in angle - resolved photoemission experiment without a hole fermi surface near the zone center .",
    "@xcite this indicates that the sign change and @xmath10-wave pairing is not a fundamental property of iron - based superconductors .",
    "thermal transport measurement is an effective method to probe the superconducting state and transport properties in the normal state in high-@xmath4 cuprates and iron - based superconductors.@xcite in smfeaso@xmath12 , the magnitude of tep develops a broad peak above @xmath4 coupled with a metallic resistivity behavior .",
    "this is attributed to resonant phonon scattering between electron and hole pocket indicating a significant fermi surface nesting in this system.@xcite tep in doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 also pointed to a significant modification of the fermi surface at small electron doping stabilizing low - temperature superconductivity . @xcite in fe@xmath13te@xmath6se@xmath0 system , tep and nernst coefficients provide evidence of the low - density and strongly correlated superconductor .",
    "@xcite finally , thermal conductivity at very low temperature provides insight into the superconducting gap structure .",

    "the thermoelectric power above @xmath4 exhibits nearly linear behavior and could be described well by the carrier diffusion mechanism in a wide temperature range .",
    "the fermi temperature @xmath17 deduced from these measurements yields a smaller @xmath18 than the value in fe@xmath13te@xmath6se@xmath0 system and other well known correlated superconductors implying weaker electronic correlation .",
    "k@xmath19fe@xmath20se@xmath21 ( k-122 ) single crystals were synthesized by self - flux method as described elsewhere in detail .  @xcite thermal and electrical transport measurement were conducted in quantum design ppms-9 .",
    "the sample was cleaved to a rectangular shape with dimension 5@xmath222 mm@xmath23 in the _ ab_-plane and 0.3 @xmath24 m thickness along the _ c_-axis .",
    "thermoelectric power and thermal conductivity were measured using steady state method and one - heater - two - thermometer setup with silver paint contact directly on the sample surface .",
    "the heat and electrical current were transported within the _ ab_-plane of the crystal oriented by laue camera , with magnetic field along the _ c_-axis and perpendicular to the heat / electrical current .",
    "the sample is very sensitive to oxygen in air , and air exposure exceeding 1 hour will result in significant surface oxidization seen by incomplete transition in @xmath25 and @xmath26 below @xmath4 .",
    "the exposure to air of samples we measured was less than 20 minutes .",
    "clear and complete superconducting transition seen in @xmath25 and @xmath27 confirmed that the surface of our samples was not oxidized .",
    "the relative error in our measurement for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 was below @xmath30 based on ni standard measured under identical conditions .",

    "tep results for two independently grown samples are nearly identical .",

    "however , the resistivity in our sample is very high .",

    "the peak in @xmath28 therefore is more likely to originate from phonons rather than the qp contribution .",

    "superconducting transition seen by tep is also suppressed and broadened by external field but the amplitude of the normal state seebeck response does not change for @xmath45 9 t. these features are reminiscent of thermally induced motion of vortex lattices in superconductors .",
    "a small peak just above @xmath4 in tep is observed only under zero field , as shown by the red arrow in fig .",
    "this is similar to some tep observed in cuprates and is attributed to the ac measuring technique.@xcite the ac measurement technique picks up a voltage contribution of thermoelectric power derivative in addition to the linear term .",
    "this is present even for good thermal contacts and is reduced for lower density of data points and sharp transitions .     in tep . ]    in the lower part of the transition ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath25 is thermally activated according to arrhenius law @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the activation energy for the flux motion .",
    "a linear behavior occurs over a typical temperature interval of about 6k .",
    "the seebeck coefficient follows identical temperature dependence in the same region .",
    "4(a , b ) show the arrhenius plot @xmath49 and @xmath50 as a function of the inverse temperature . the conventional theory can not reproduce the large tep in the mixed state , similar to the high-@xmath4 cuprates . @xcite the activation energy for the flux motion obtained from resistivity decreases exponentially with magnetic field , but the value obtained from tep is nearly unchanged and larger , as shown in fig .",

    "tep is associated with entropy and heat transport parallel to the `` induced '' electric field .",
    "this longitudinal entropy flow is not carried by the normal excitations in the vortex cores since these excitations move with the vortices perpendicular to the induced electric field ( nernst effect ) .",
    "@xcite the longitudinal entropy transport has to be attributed to other excitations .",
    "we postulate that tep in the mixed state near @xmath4 is attributed to quasi - particles ( qp ) excited over the energy gap as in high @xmath4 cuprates.@xcite such excitations , not bound to the vortex core , are present in any superconductor at finite temperature and may be important in determining the dissipation due to the short coherence length.@xcite therefore , an estimate of tep can be obtained from @xmath52 where @xmath53 are tep and resistivity in the mixed state ( m ) and normal state ( n ) , respectively , since tep from longitudinal entropy flow has a small dependence on the hall angle .",
    "@xcite this is in a good agreement with experimental data , as shown in fig .",
    "we now turn to tep in the normal state .",
    "tep is the sum of three different contributions : the diffusion term @xmath54 , the spin - dependent scattering term and the phonon - drag term @xmath55 due to electron - phonon coupling.@xcite the spin dependent scattering or corresponding magnon drag effect always gives @xmath56 dependence,@xcite which is not observed in our tep results .",
    "moreover , tep in our sample above @xmath4 is independent of magnetic field , which excludes the spin - dependent mechanism .",
    "the contribution of phonon - drag term often gives @xmath57 dependence for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the debye temperature ) , and a peak structure for @xmath62.@xcite the estimated debye temperature of k-122 system is about 260 k.@xcite the absence of the peak structure in our tep results suggests negligible contribution of the phonon drag effect to @xmath27 .",
    "instead a nearly linear relationship is observed between 2 k and 120 k ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , suggesting that the diffusion term is dominant .",
    "diffusive seebeck response of a fermi liquid is expected to be linear in @xmath63 in the zero - temperature limit , with a magnitude proportional to the strength of electronic correlations.@xcite this is similar to the t - linear electronic specific heat , @xmath64 .",
    "both can be linked to the fermi temperature @xmath17 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath67 is the electron charge and @xmath68 is the carrier density.@xcite fig .",
    "5 presents the temperature dependence of tep divided by @xmath63 , @xmath69 under 0 t ( open squares ) , 9 t ( open circles ) magnetic field for sample a and 0 t ( close squares ) for sample b , respectively .",
    "tep in the normal state near @xmath4 is independent of magnetic field and can be described well by diffusive model .",
    "the zero - temperature extrapolated value of @xmath69 is @xmath70 @xmath71 for @xmath72 t ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "we can therefore extract @xmath73 k.    , @xmath69 in k@xmath74fe@xmath1se@xmath2 under 0 t ( open squares ) and 9 t ( open circles ) magnetic field for sample a , and under 0 t ( close squares ) for sample b , respectively .",
