    "piezoelectric lead titanate oxide ( pbtio@xmath1 , pt ) is of considerable scientific and technical interest because of its extraordinary electromechanical properties leading to the development of novel devices , such as nonvolatile memories , detectors , sensors or actuators @xcite .",
    "a variety of ferroelectric properties can be controlled by replacing the lead or titanium cations with rare - earth or transition - metal ions . in general",
    ", the effect of aliovalent dopants on pbtio@xmath1 , such as fe@xmath0 , leads to the creation of oxygen vacancies ( @xmath5 ) ( the krger and vink notation is used to designate the charge state of the defect with respect to the neutral lattice . ) for charge compensation , which are expected to have a major impact on properties and performance of ferroelectric compounds .",
    "however , it is still not certain at which coordination sphere the charge compensation takes place , and because the oxygen vacancies are known to be the dominant charge carriers in this class of compounds this is an issue of technological and scientific importance @xcite . beside charge compensation provided by @xmath6 ,",
    "intrinsic doubly negatively charged @xmath7 centers have been proposed as additional charge compensating mechanism @xcite , these vacancies , however , being rather immobile and almost of no importance for charge transport .",
    "when dealing with dopants on a sub - percentage level , a sensitive test of the local environment around the functional center can only be provided by electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) . in case of paramagnetic fe@xmath0 dopants ,",
    "the sextet spin ground state is most influenced by the ligand - field originating from the nearest - neighbor o@xmath8 ions .",
    "the resulting finestructure ( fs ) interaction is a measure of the local symmetry .",
    "various structure models have been proposed such as fe@xmath9 defect associates , not - coordinated free fe@xmath10 centers , as well as off - center shifted iron centers .",
    "previous epr studies on crystalline samples reported fs parameters spanning a large range @xcite .",
    "structural information about the dopant site in pbtio@xmath1 and related compounds can be based on modelling the magnitude of the fs parameter , and therefore its accurate determination is an important issue . because most samples are provided in polycrystalline form , it was important to demonstrate that fs parameters can reliably be determined even for polycrystalline compounds by invoking high - frequency - epr @xcite .",
    "structure modelling can be performed using different levels of sophistication .",
    "for instance , the fs parameter can be analyzed in terms of the semi - empirical _ newman superposition model _ ( _ nsm _ ) @xcite . within this model , values for local distortion , i.e. , atomic displacements from the ideal crystal structure in the vicinity of the fe@xmath0 center ,",
    "are derived by comparing calculated and observed fs parameters .",
    "a detailed study was performed already 25 years ago by siegel and mller @xcite , in which the distortion of the cubic high - temperature unit cell in the ferroelectric phase was taken as decisive parameter controlling the fs splitting at the iron site . over the past decades , the _ nsm _ parametrization has been refined by applying the method to many examples of paramagnetic centers in perovskite - type crystals .",
    "examples include iron - doped pbtio@xmath1 , srtio@xmath1 and batio@xmath1 @xcite , litao@xmath1 @xcite , as well as chromium - modified pbtio@xmath1 @xcite and manganese in batio@xmath1 @xcite .     with designation of the different oxygen sites .",
    "the experimental atomic distances for the ti - site to the surrounding oxygen octaeder are given in pm . ]",
    "second , an alternate approach offering additional microscopic information , is provided by calculating the equilibrium structure using density - functional theory ( _ dft _ ) . in recent years",
    "numerous calculations have been performed on ferroelectric materials in order to explain the microscopic mechanisms of spontaneous polarization @xcite and phase diagrams @xcite , or to determine the full piezoelectric stress tensor and dynamical charges @xcite . in particular , the role of defects and defect dipoles has been highlighted .",
    "oxygen vacancies were shown to pin at 180@xmath11-domain walls , confirming the tendency of these defects to migrate to the walls @xcite .",
    "it was also derived that lead vacancies have stable charges ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and thus being an effective acceptor in lead titanate @xcite .",
    "the dipole moment @xmath14 of di - vacancies was calculated , demonstrating that the increased value may be an important source of local polarization and electric fields @xcite .",
    "another defect dipole originates from interstitial hydrogen impurities in lead titanate , which were found to bind to oxygen and to act as shallow donor impurities .",
    "the h - o dipole increases the polarization and the barrier for reversing the defect dipole , which can give rise to imprint @xcite .    in this work , we exploit the recently accurately determined fs parameter @xcite as basis for structure modelling by performing an _ nsm _ analysis .",
    "second , we compare the results obtained from this semi - empirical approach with results from _ dft _ calculations , thus providing a sound basis for the postulated structural relaxation at the impurity site . as a result",
    ", we present a refined structural model of the iron functional center in lead titanate .",
    "with its five unpaired electrons , the free fe@xmath0 ion possesses a half - filled @xmath15 shell and can be described as orbital singlet .",
    "its ground state configuration is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and the six - fold spin degeneracy can be lifted by the fs interaction and an external magnetic field .",
    "neglecting hyperfine interaction , because the magnetic active isotope @xmath18fe is present in only 2.2 % natural abundance , an approximate spin - hamiltonian for this high - spin system can be written as    @xmath19    here , @xmath20 denotes the bohr magneton , @xmath21 is the external magnetic field , @xmath22 the electron @xmath23-matrix , @xmath24 are the fs hamiltonian coefficients and @xmath25 are the extended stevens spin operators @xcite .",
    "the first term represents the electronic zeeman interaction and the second term is the effective fs hamiltonian , describing the interaction of the crystal field with the paramagnetic ion .",
    "the rank @xmath26 in the hamiltonian must be even , and @xmath26 is restricted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , allowing terms up to @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "however , parameters @xmath31 only up to second rank ( @xmath32 ) will be used , because terms of fourth rank were shown to be at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those of second rank @xcite(c - e ) .",
    "parameters @xmath31 are related to the standard fs parameters @xmath33 by means of the scaling factor as @xmath34 . for @xmath32",
    "one finds @xmath35 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 are related to the conventional spectroscopic fs parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fs term in ( [ hamiltonian_general ] ) lifts the degeneracy of eigen states even in the absence of an external magnetic field .",

    "the resulting scalar @xmath46 value is expected to be close to that of the free electron @xmath47 .",

    ", the _ nsm _ can be used in its truncated form @xcite    @xmath63    the strategy followed is to calculate the fs parameter by using the _ nsm _ for different conceivable structural arrangements , and to compare the calculated values with the experimental data .",

    "the low temperature crystal structure of lead titanate has been the subject of some controversy over the past 50 years .",
    "several x - ray and optical studies as well as dielectric measurements of pt samples indicated small anomalies in the temperature regions around 173 k and 123 k. these anomalies were detected as changes in the negative volume expansion coefficient in combination with superlattice reflections in powder samples @xcite below 173 k and as changes in lattice parameters and birefringence in single crystals around 183 k. they were interpreted as a possible second order phase transition to a different tetragonal , later corrected into an antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , this earlier claimed low - temperature tetragonal phase was assumed to transform into a further tetragonal phase around 113 k @xcite , which does not fit into the picture of having an orthorhombic phase present at this temperature range .",
    "however , neither in neutron powder profiles @xcite , nor in x - ray dilatometric and optical measurements using pt single crystals , additional evidence was seen for a structural transition at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "first - principle studies @xcite show that the thermodynamically stable phase at low temperatures is the tetragonal one , as all the unit - cell preserving distortions at low temperature have positive elastic constants and as there are no other mechanical instabilities present that could cause a transition to a lower symmetry group .    to identify the low - temperature structure and to obtain reference values for the interpretation of epr data recorded at low temperatures ,",
    "a high - resolution synchrotron powder diffraction experiment was carried out in reflection geometry at b2 , hasylab in hamburg , germany ( figure [ xray_pt ] ) .",
    "the measurement was performed at 12 k using a he closed - cycle cryostat , equilibrating the temperature in a low - pressure helium atmosphere .",
    "the powdered sample was glued onto a si ( 711 ) low - background wafer and measured using an incident beam of wavelength @xmath79 nm in combination with an analyzing crystal and a scintillation counter @xcite .    for rietveld refinement ,",
    "the general structure analysis system ( gsas ) @xcite was used .",
    "as the peak profiles of the ferroelectric material are quite complex , the profiles were fitted using the incorporated generalized model for anisotropic peak broadening @xcite .",
    "the structural model could be refined with the symmetry of @xmath80 , keeping the lead positions fixed at the origin .",
    "no superlattice reflections were detected .",
    "the @xmath4 - ratio is 1.0721 at this temperature .",
    "lattice parameters and atom coordinates obtained are given in table [ x_ray_results ] .",
    "the detected low - temperature @xmath80 symmetry is consistent with the interpretation of the epr spectra , for which a fs tensor of axial symmetry was used , thus indicating that no orthorhombic phase is present @xcite .",
    "therefore it can be concluded that pbtio@xmath1 remains tetragonal down to 12 k , as already assumed earlier @xcite .          the intrinsic _ nsm _ parameters @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 have not yet been determined for iron centers in lead titanate .",
    "however , they may be adopted from similar single crystals having equivalent fe@xmath83o@xmath8 bonds in octahedral coordination . for fe@xmath0 in mgo at the central site with octahedral oxygen coordination , the following set of _ nsm _ parameters was reported : @xmath84 ghz , @xmath85 , @xmath86 pm @xcite .",
    "the ionic positions of the nearest oxygens were taken from the x - ray data at 12 k ( cf .",
    "section [ x_ray ] ) . because the site symmetry defines the direction of fs - tensor axes , the principal fs axis of the fe@xmath0 center was chosen along [ 0 0 1 ] .",
    "the common reference structure for undistorted cubic pbtio@xmath1 is the perovskite structure , in which ti@xmath3 ions are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen ions and are positioned at the center of the unit cell .",
    "the pb@xmath87 ions are twelvefold coordinated by oxygens and are located at the corners of the cube , whereas the o@xmath8 ions are centered on each face of the unit cell . in the ferroelectric tetragonal phase ,",
    "the oxygen octahedron is elongated along [ 0 0 1 ] and also shifted by 54 pm with respect to the pb@xmath87 position , the titanium ion being displaced from the center of cell along [ 0 0 1 ] by 17 pm , respectively . as a result , the titanium ion occupies an _ off - center _ position within the shifted oxygen octahedron ( cf .",
    "table [ x_ray_results ] , figures [ 3d_structure ] , [ structure ] ) .",
    "iron is believed to substitute ti@xmath3 as fe@xmath0 at the b - site in the abo@xmath1 perovskite structure . in order to verify this hypothesis , in the calculation we also considered the possibility that it substitutes at the a - site for pb@xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , to decide whether the oxygen vacancy is situated in the first coordination sphere or if it is located more distantly , two more structure models were investigated , with and without oxygen vacancy in nearest neighbor positions .",
    "the model of a directly coordinated oxygen vacancy can be realized in two different arrangements , in which the vacancy may substitute either for the apical o1 or o1 position ( cf . figure [ 3d_structure ] ) .",
    "a vacancy coordination at the equatorial o2 and o3 positions can be excluded as the orientation of the fe@xmath88 defect dipole has to be along the @xmath2-axis , due to the epr results that indicate axial symmetry at the iron center @xcite . for orientations of the oxygen vacancy along the @xmath89 and @xmath90 axes ,",
    "the fs tensor would be of only orthorhombic symmetry .",
    "for a final model , the effect of a likely relaxation of oxygen ion positions in case of a directly coordinated oxygen vacancy has been taken into account .",

    "was varied along [ 0 0 1 ] , the parameter @xmath91 defining the shift of the ion .",

    "four conclusions immediately emerge from the nsm calculations : as compared to earlier studies for the iron center in lead titanate @xcite , in which static oxygen positions were used , the inclusion of relaxed positions for the equatorial oxygens towards the vacancy yields substantially refined and quite different curves for @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the extremum of the @xmath64 dependence is no a - priori viable position for the iron displacement as has earlier been exploited as first guess @xcite ; the intersection points with the experimental value , not necessarily coinciding with the extremum , should be used instead .",
    "finally , agreement with the experimental value @xcite can be obtained only with a model , in which fe@xmath0 is substituted at the b - site with a directly coordinated oxygen vacancy , thus forming an fe@xmath95 defect associate .    in the pure , unsubstituted ferroelectric phase ,",
    "ti@xmath3 is displaced considerably from the center of the oxygen octahedron ( cf .",

    "next , one oxygen vacancy was inserted in the @xmath106 supercell without providing charge compensation , i.e. , the electronic structure of pb@xmath107ti@xmath107o@xmath108 was calculated for a determination of the local relaxation of the ions around the vacancy . as shown in figure [ structure ] ( d ) , one finds that the nearest neighbor ti ions move away from the vacancy site , which was also predicted in a previous lda calculation @xcite . if the vacancy is located at the o1 site ( cf .",

    "the most striking prediction from the _ nsm _ calculations is that the fe@xmath0 functional center in lead titanate forms a charged fe@xmath103 defect associate with an oxygen vacancy in the local oxygen octahedron , the iron being substituted at the b - site of the perovskite abo@xmath1 lattice .",
    "the similarity of ionic radii between ti@xmath3 at 68 pm and fe@xmath0 at 64 pm as compared to pb@xmath87 with a radius of 124 pm supports this assignment . in",
    "fully or partly ionic compounds , vacancies are charge balanced by other defects forming an overall neutral system . it can be assumed that partial charge compensation takes place at a nearest - neighbor oxygen site in the octahedron , because the resulting coulomb interaction is the most important driving force for association .",
    "this assignment is in accordance with first - principle calculations that predict the binding of oxygen vacancies to acceptor - type impurities @xcite , as well as to our _ dft _ investigations that favor defect associates .",
    "experimental findings indicate , however , that for other acceptor centers in similar compounds , like chromium - doped pbtio@xmath1 @xcite and copper - modified pb[zr@xmath161ti@xmath162o@xmath1 @xcite , no such association is present . alternatively , like in iron - doped srtio@xmath1",
    ", an equilibrium between free fe@xmath116 centers and fe@xmath103 defect associates can be present @xcite .",
    "with respect to the ionic mobility of free oxygen vacancies , the iron - oxygen vacancy defect dipole complex will be rather immobile in the ceramic .",
    "hence , charge transport will be considerably hindered .",
    "furthermore , the charged defect agglomerate may influence the poling properties by providing pinning centers for domain walls @xcite .",
    "moreover , dipolar defect complexes have been demonstrated to be able to also pin the polarization of the surrounding crystal @xcite .",
    "in particular , oxygen - vacancy related defect dipoles have been shown to be involved in voltage offsets leading to imprint failure @xcite and are suggested to play a crucial role in electrical fatigue @xcite .",
    "with respect to the reliability of the predictions obtained by the semi - empirical _ nsm _ approach , the following points should be mentioned .",
    "first , crystal distortions near the substituted ion and contributions from ions or vacancies more distant than neighboring ligands are neglected .",
    "second , the main assumption of the _ nsm _ is that the spin - hamiltonian parameters result from individual crystal field contributions of every nearest neighbor ion . finally , the model is based upon the calculation of single electron - derived charge densities , whereas the fs interaction is related to two - electron expectation values .",
    "apparently , the _ nsm _ has proven to yield reliable results for determining the second- and fourth - rank finestructure parameters in @xmath45-state ions , probably because the intrinsic parameters have been refined over several decades using a large set of experimental data . if iron at a b - site of the perovskite abo@xmath1 lattice can be considered as part of this set , the structural data can be considered as reliable .    within these limits",
    ", the results can be interpreted as follows : the fe@xmath0 ion with the nearby oxygen vacancy probably has a position near the center of the truncated oxygen octahedron , i.e. at the ( 0.5000 0.5000 0.6288 ) position , whereas the second position in accordance with _",
    "nsm _ prediction can be discarded because of _ dft_-based results .",
    "as mentioned above , for all _ dft _ calculations a @xmath163 unit cell was used .",
    "this size of the unit cell seems to be too small to avoid interaction of the defects , and the relaxation at the defect site could be smaller if larger unit cells are used .",
    "however , for computation time reasons we could not expand our unit cell . nevertheless , it is most encouraging to find that the local structure with respect to fe@xmath0 positioning , predicted by _",
    "dft _ calculation and by the semi - empirical model are quite similar .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good and might be fortuitous , considering the rather small supercell accomplished by an effective 12.5 % iron doping    the quantum mechanical simulations show , that the association of the defects is preferred over the arrangement as isolated point defects .",
    "additionally , the arrangements for an orientation of the defect associate along the @xmath2-axis are more stable than the ones along the @xmath89 and @xmath90-axes , confirming the conclusion drawn from the axial symmetry of the fs tensor @xcite .",
    "the off - center position of the fe ion in the oxygen octahedron leads to two fe@xmath103 distances in c direction and therefore to two different positions of the oxygen vacancy .",
    "according to the dft investigations the vacancy at the o1 position in figure [ 3d_structure ] is energetically favored , in which the long o1- fe@xmath116 distance decreases significantly .    finally , because the observed epr spectra @xcite can almost exclusively be interpreted in terms of fe@xmath88 associates , one can conclude that no free fe@xmath0 signals , i.e. , iron ions without associated @xmath117 and hence with considerably smaller fs values , are present .",
    "considering the condition for overall charge compensation there is a charge mismatch , because the fe@xmath0 ion substituting for the ti@xmath3 ions are singly negative charged ( fe@xmath116 ) , whereas the associated oxygen vacancy is doubly positive charged ( @xmath6 ) with respect to the neutral lattice .",
    "hence , additional mechanisms for charge compensation have to be discussed .",
    "candidates for charge compensation are either free electrons ( @xmath164 ) trapped in the lattice , lead vacancies @xmath165 , and the formation of positively charged cations , such as pb@xmath87 @xmath166 pb@xmath123 , ti@xmath3 @xmath166 ti@xmath0 , or fe@xmath0 @xmath166 fe@xmath87 .",
    "however , there no evidence for color centers in the _ dft _ calculations and the variable valency ions pb@xmath123 , ti@xmath0 are paramagnetic with @xmath46-values at about @xmath167 to 1.9 , which were not observed in the epr spectra and thus can be excluded . since intrinsic double negatively charged lead vacancies @xmath7 have been suggested as additional charge compensation @xcite , the overall electro - neutrality condition for iron - modified lead titanate thus is proposed to be given by    @xmath168 = [ { \\rm fe}'_{\\rm ti } ] + \\frac{1}{2 } [ v''_{\\rm pb}]\\ ] ]    this model is supported by the inherent loss of pbo during processing , for which reason a natural intrinsic @xmath14 di - vacancy pair was proposed @xcite , its existence , however , being currently controversially discussed on the basis of _ dft _ calculations @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "charge - compensation could also be obtained by the creation of fe@xmath169fe@xmath170 defect associates without the need for lead vacancies at all .",
    "the existence of such a defect structure is also supported by the _ dft _",
    "results , predicting this arrangement as of lowest energy . in this structure ,",
    "the _ dft _ calculations predicts two different iron sites , for which reason two fe@xmath0 epr spectra with different fs parameters are expected . using the calculated displacements of @xmath171 pm and @xmath142 pm , the corresponding _",
    "nsm _ estimates are @xmath172 ghz and @xmath173 ghz , respectively .",
    "these values differ considerably from the experimentally obtained one , and for this reason this model can be discarded . furthermore , for samples with low iron doping , this prediction of an fe@xmath174fe@xmath116 defect associate might not be upheld .",
    "finally , from the present epr experiment there is no further evidence for this hypothesis , because no indication for strongly dipolar coupled iron centers is detected in the epr spectra .",
    "in summary , a charged fe@xmath103 defect associate in lead titanate has been identified and its microscopic structure has been determined based on a comparison of fs data with results of semi - empirical _ nsm _ and _ dft _ calculations .",
    "the refined structure comprises information about the structural relaxation around the iron functional center in lead titanate . in the model",
    "presented , fe@xmath0 is substituted as an acceptor center at the perovskite b - site with a directly coordinated oxygen vacancy .",
    "the position of the iron ion in the ferroelectric phase is found to be almost centered in the unit cell , different from the bulk b - site ti@xmath3 ions in the ferroelectric phase that are considerably displaced , but similar to the b - site positions in the paraelectric phase .",
    "the orientation of the fe@xmath103 defect dipole is found to be along the crystallographic @xmath2-axis .",
    "this can be concluded from epr results which indicate axial symmetry at the iron center .",
    "any other orientation of the defect dipole would result in an fs tensor of lower than axial symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the _ dft _ calculations confirm this assignment by showing that the total energy of the arrangement along the @xmath2-axis is more stable than the ones along the @xmath89 and @xmath90-axes .",
    "using high - resolution synchrotron powder diffraction , a quite large @xmath4-ratio of 1.0721 was measured , again pointing to the uniqueness of structural relaxation along _",
    "c_.    the impact of iron - doping in lead titanate on the macroscopic piezoelectric properties can now be rationalized from a microscopic point of view , because the iron - oxygen vacancy defect dipole complex will be rather immobile in the ceramic as compared to the ionic mobility of free oxygen vacancies .",
    "thus , charge transport will be considerably hindered and the charged defect agglomerate may furthermore influence domain - wall motion and poling properties by providing pinning domain walls .",
