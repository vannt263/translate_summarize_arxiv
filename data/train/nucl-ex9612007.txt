    "the statistics of the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei have been the subject of much experimental and theoretical work in the past decade .",
    "so wide an interest was stimulated by the conjecture that , owing to the intrinsic fluctuations of the decay rate , the counting statistics could depart from the simple poissonian behavior  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results are often conflicting , even for the same kind of source .",
    "on the one hand , there exist investigations both on @xmath6 ( @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite ) and @xmath0 decays ( @xmath9  @xcite ) that confirm the poissonian nature of these processes .",
    "on the other hand , several experiments carried out both with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11  @xcite ) and with @xmath0 sources ( @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14sr-@xmath15y  @xcite ) , find that the counting variance , for long counting periods , is higher than the poissonian value by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "this anomalous large variance has been taken as an experimental evidence that the power spectrum of the decay - rate fluctuations has a contribution that grows as the inverse of the frequency @xmath16 at low frequencies , in addition to the usual frequency - independent poissonian component .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed as possible sources of this @xmath5 noise : quantum self - interference between the wave packets of the emitted particles  @xcite , solid - angle fluctuations and random rearrangements within the source  @xcite , spatial @xmath5 noise in the detector  @xcite . as a matter of fact , the interpretation of the decay experiments reporting a variance in excess of the poisson value is still an open problem  @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we considered the decay statistics of a @xmath2 source ( @xmath17 ) . in that case , we measured that , for counting periods @xmath18 longer than one hour , the variance of the decay rate significantly deviated from the poissonian prediction .",
    "however , that behaviour could be fully explained by taking into account the time dependence of the statistics  @xcite without resorting to any exotic effect  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to extend our experimental study to a different nucleus , @xmath1 , that undergoes @xmath0 decay .",
    "there are in fact theoretical claims  @xcite that deviations from poissonian statistics could be caused by self - interference of the emitted particles and that these deviations should be present only in @xmath0 decays and not in @xmath2 or @xmath6 decays .",
    "the mean lifetime of @xmath1 is ( @xmath19 ) years  @xcite . while most of the nuclei directly @xmath0 decay into the ground state of @xmath20 , a small fraction ( 0.91% ) @xmath0-decays into an excited state of energy @xmath21  kev , which then decays to the ground state ( mean lifetime : @xmath22 seconds ) . in the 3.45  % of cases ,",
    "this second fast transition produces a @xmath23  kev @xmath2-photon : our apparatus has been set up to detect this photon . in summary ,",
    "our measurement has the characteristic of selecting a fraction @xmath24 of the total decays ( @xmath25 ) : those decays that go through the two - step process , @xmath0 emission followed by a @xmath23  kev photon  @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss later and in the appendix why and to what extent our results on the statistics of the @xmath2 s also carry information on the total statistics of the @xmath0 decays .",
    "the source is a crystal of @xmath26 containing @xmath1 nuclei ( activity : 3.7 gbq ) shaped as a thin disk ( diameter : 14 mm ) with an aluminium cap .",
    "the aluminium cap , which closes the source , filters out the @xmath0 particles .",
    "in the two experiments , which we denote a and b , we used the same source at different distances ( about 15 and 7  cm , respectively ) from the detector in order to change the count rate : while poissonian statistics only depends on the total number of counts ( rate @xmath27 time ) , deviations from the standard case ( and/or systematic errors ) could in principle depend also on the rate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for one such an example ) and it is better to have the possibility of performing this kind of checks .    in each experiment",
    "the photons were detected by a disk - shaped crystal of nai(tl ) ( diameter : 5 cm ) integrally mounted on a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) : we used a crystal 1 mm thick in experiment a , and a crystal 2 mm thick in experiment b.    in both experiments , the output signal from the pmt , after being amplified and shaped to a gaussian pulse , passed through a single - channel analyzer , which selected pulses corresponding to an energy window from 2 to 53  kev .",
    "the pulse - shaping time constant was @xmath28s and the time resolution of the single - channel analyzer @xmath29s .",
    "the dead time of the entire system was about @xmath30s .",
    "the energy window was preliminarily set by means of a multi - channel analyzer module ; we have verified that no appreciable drift of the window occurred during the experiments , which lasted 76 days ( a ) and 19 days ( b ) .",
    "we verified that the stability of the energy window and of the voltage of the power supply were sufficient to keep systematic variations of the counting rate below 0.01% , therefore below the statistical fluctuations we measured : only for the longest measurements ( total counts of the order of @xmath31 ) the fluctuations - to - signal ratio was as low as @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "counting was executed by a programmable multi - channel scaler ( mcs ) module interfaced to an ibm pc , which provides for control and data storage . in experiment a ( b ) , a set of 40 ( 38 ) values of the counting period @xmath18 was preliminarily defined in the control program with @xmath18 ranging from @xmath34s to @xmath35s ( @xmath36s ) . for each value of @xmath18",
    "the mcs module counted the events occurring in each of 64 consecutive periods of length @xmath18 .",
    "count data were saved on hard disk for further off - line analysis . at the end of experiment a ( b ) ,",
    "data were available as 40 ( 38 ) sequences of 64 counts @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , one for each of the prefixed values of @xmath18 .",
    "we analyzed the data by computing the average count and the allan variance ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) as function of the time interval @xmath18 .",
    "all our results originate from a single uninterrupted run ( for each experiment ) , have been averaged over the same number ( 64 ) of consecutive intervals , and are statistically independent ( each count has been used only once ) .",
    "first we verified that the count rate during each experiment had no drifts that could bias the allan variance ; in particular , the slow exponential decay of the source could not affect the allan variance at the low count rates we operated  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is consistent that we consider a constant average rate .",
    "we measured this average rate @xmath39 finding @xmath40  count / s in experiment a and @xmath41  count / s in experiment b. being the rate constant , the average count for an interval of length @xmath18 @xmath42 has an expectation value proportional to @xmath18 : @xmath43 .",
    "there are two reasons for using the allan variance , which we estimate with an average over 63 consecutive measurements @xmath44 ^ 2 \\ , , \\label{def : all}\\ ] ] instead of the usual variance .",
    "the first and most important reason is that @xmath45 is finite even when the power spectrum grows as @xmath5 at low frequencies : when non - poissonian fluctuations might be present , the allan variance is then a common choice . we remind that the power spectrum of poissonian fluctuations is independent of frequency : @xmath46 ; since counts are uncorrelated , the allan and the usual variance have the same expectation ( use @xmath47 and eq .",
    "( [ def : all ] ) ) , namely , the average count : @xmath48 . however , if the fluctuations have a power spectrum @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is a constant independent of @xmath16 ) , i.e. , we are in presence of @xmath5 noise , the expectation value of @xmath51 is : @xmath52 ( note the different power of @xmath18 compared to poissonian fluctuations ) , while the usual variance is infinite  @xcite .",
    "a second additional advantage of using the allan variance is that it is less sensible to drifts of the count rate : the correction is independent of the number of intervals ( 64 ) and not proportional to it , see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .    before discussing our results ,",
    "we wish to comment on our choice of observing the channel of the decay characterized by the emission of a 21.532  kev photon .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in the appendix .",
    "we made this choice because we can control better the stability of our measurements when detecting photons than when detecting electrons , given our present equipment .",
    "however , since one of the motivations of our experiment was to study fluctuations in a @xmath0 decay , it is natural to ask to what extent the statistics of the @xmath2 emission reflects the statistics of the @xmath0 decay . the time delay of the emission is so small ( mean lifetime of the excited state : @xmath22 seconds ) compared to the time intervals of interest that its effect is negligible .",
    "yet one might worry that the fluctuations of the small branching ratio ( the fraction of decays that on average emit the @xmath2 is only @xmath53 ) might overwhelm any exotic effect of the original decay .",
    "the explicit calculation reported in the appendix shows that : ( 1 ) an upper bound on the flicker floor in the statistics of the @xmath2 s implies an equal bound on the flicker floor in the statistics of the parent decay ; ( 2 ) an upper bound on the ratio of @xmath5 noise to poissonian noise in the statistics of the @xmath2 s implies a corresponding bound for the statistics of the parent decay weaker by a factor @xmath54 ; ( 3 ) upper bounds on less singular , e.g. frequency independent , deviations from poissonian behavior in the statistics of the @xmath2 s imply corresponding bounds on the parent decay : these bounds on the statistics of the @xmath0 decay are also weaker by a factor @xmath55 .",
    "we report in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the ratio @xmath56 ( reduced allan variance ) versus the inverse of the number of counts @xmath57 for experiments a and b , respectively . both experiments show that @xmath58 depends linearly on @xmath59 with unit slope in the range of @xmath18 considered .",
    "the data perfectly fit the poisson prediction @xmath60 ; this prediction is also reported in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] as a solid line .",
    "a fit to the data yields @xmath61 .    on the contrary ,",
    "a power spectrum @xmath62 would yield @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , if we suppose that both a poissonian and a @xmath5 contribution are present , when @xmath18 is large enough the poissonian contribution becomes negligible and @xmath58 goes to a constant ( @xmath64 ) : this constant @xmath65 is usually called flicker floor .",
    "we measured values of @xmath58 as low as @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in the experiment a ( b ) at @xmath68  s ( @xmath69  s ) without seeing deviations from poissonian behavior and , in particular , no signal of the curve turning up at large @xmath18 and becoming constant .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , if a flicker floor is present , @xmath70 ; as discussed in the appendix , this limit is valid also for the @xmath0 decay .    if we express the power spectrum as the sum of the poissonian component plus a hypothetical @xmath5 component : @xmath71 , in the range of frequencies accessible by our experiments ( @xmath72 ) , the limit on the flicker floor implies an upper limit on the ratio of the strength of the @xmath5 contribution ( @xmath73 ) relative to the poissonian one ( @xmath74 ) , i.e. , a limit on the ratio @xmath75 : @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these limits on the strength of the @xmath5 noise are valid for the channel of the decay with @xmath2 emission ; for the total @xmath0 decays the limit is weaker ( see appendix ) : @xmath78 .",
    "the model of quantum @xmath5 noise proposed by handel predicts @xmath79 for @xmath0 decays , see eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ; here @xmath80 is the fine structure constant , @xmath81 is a coherence factor , and @xmath82 is the velocity change of the particles in the emission process relative to the speed of light @xmath83 : if @xmath84 is the kinetic energy of the electron , @xmath85^{-2}$ ] .",
    "since we did not measured the electron energy , our data are averaged over the entire electron - energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , we can only give an estimate of the limit on the coherence factor by using the average electron energy : @xmath86  kev .",
    "the fact that we do not see any flicker floor implies , in the context of handel s model , that the coherence factor @xmath87 must be smaller than about @xmath88 .",
    "our limit should be compared to the recent positive determinations of @xmath87 in the range @xmath89 , that gopala et al .",
    "@xcite have made , albeit in different @xmath0 decays : @xmath14sr , @xmath15y and @xmath90tl .",
    "we do not have any explanation why @xmath87 should be more than two orders of magnitude larger in those decays compared to our upper limit .",
    "we have measured the counting rate of secondary @xmath2 rays from a @xmath0 source of @xmath1 for counting periods ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath91 seconds , and studied the fluctuations of the rate by means of the allan variance .",
    "* we have found no evidence of deviations from poissonian behavior up to a ratio of fluctuations to signal as low as @xmath92 .",
    "* the ratio between a hypothetical @xmath5 component of the power spectrum and the usual poissonian contribution must be less than @xmath93 at the longest time interval ( lowest frequency ) that we have measured ( @xmath94  s ) .",
    "* we found no evidence of flicker floor .",
    "the upper bound on a hypothetical flicker floor is @xmath95 ; this limit is valid also for the statistics of the total @xmath0 decays . *",
    "if our upper bound the flicker floor is interpreted in the context of handel s theory of @xmath5 noise predicting coherent interference of the emitted charged particle , the coherence factor @xmath87 for this decay must be less than about @xmath93 : this number is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the one that has been recently proposed in the literature albeit for different decays  @xcite .          in this appendix , we discuss the relation between fluctuations of the number of total decays ( in our case , the total number of @xmath0 decays ) and fluctuations of the number of decays in a subchannel ( in our case , the fraction of @xmath0 decays that produce a @xmath2 photon with energy 21.532  kev ) .",
    "we consider only the effect of the fluctuations of the branching ratio and not the effect of time delay between the first and second decay , which in general has the effect of a low - pass filter  @xcite , since this second decay ( the @xmath2 emission ) is practically instantaneous for the case under study ( mean lifetime 13.8  ns compared to a time resolution of the order of @xmath96s and to the shortest time interval considered : 1  ms ) .    in the following",
    "we shall use the symbol @xmath97 when referring to the number of detected @xmath2 s and the symbol @xmath98 when referring to the corresponding ( total ) number of @xmath0 decays .",
    "we shall also use the subscript @xmath2 ( @xmath0 ) referring to the partial daughter statistics ( total parent statistics ) .",
    "let us define two kinds of averages : + @xmath99 average over the @xmath2-count distribution keeping the number of @xmath0 counts @xmath98 fixed ; + @xmath100 average over the @xmath0-count distribution .",
    "+ using the symbol @xmath24 for the branching ratio , we can write @xmath101 where for simplicity we use the symbol @xmath102 to indicate the number of @xmath2 counts twice averaged both over the @xmath2 and @xmath0 distributions and , at the same time , the symbol @xmath103 to indicate the average @xmath0 counts ( over the @xmath0 distribution ) .",
    "since our experiments do not show any deviation from poissonian behavior , we can readily put limits on non - poissonian components of the @xmath2 counts .",
    "the implications for the total @xmath0 decay can be assessed by assuming that the @xmath2 distribution at fixed number of @xmath0 decays @xmath98 is standard ( binomial and frequency independent ) and by considering the effect of fluctuations of @xmath98 : @xmath104 where the indices @xmath105 and @xmath106 indicate different counting intervals .",

    "then this ratio for the @xmath0 decay can be related to the same ratio for the @xmath2 decay by using the fact that the limit on @xmath119 and the one on @xmath133 are equal : @xmath134 .",
    "we loose a factor @xmath55 going from the upper bound on the ratio of the @xmath5 contribution relative to the poissonian one for the @xmath2 statistics ( @xmath93 ) to the upper bound on the same ratio for the @xmath0 statistics ( @xmath135 ) .",

    ".    in conclusion , we have show in this appendix that a measurement of a process ( @xmath0 decay ) by selecting a subprocess ( detecting the @xmath2 emitted in a fraction of the decays ) whose branching ratio @xmath24 is itself a statistical variable corresponds , as might have been expected , to the use of a detector with efficiency not greater than @xmath24 .",
