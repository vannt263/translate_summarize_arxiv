    "since the pioneering works of flory  @xcite , de gennes  @xcite and edwards  @xcite , excluded volume effects and topological constraints have been recognised playing a fundamental role in the comprehension of the structural and dynamical properties of polymers in semi - dilute solutions and melts .",
    "topological constraints ( or , _ entanglements _ ) hinder the thermal motion of polymers in a way akin to the process of threading a rope out of a pool : polymer chains can not pass through each other , while they are allowed to slide past each other .",
    "this fundamental mechanism is recognised to be responsible for the unique properties of polymer solutions and melts  @xcite .",
    "since the very early days of polymer physics , theoretical speculation and experimental investigation have mainly dealt with solutions and melts of _ linear _ polymer chains  @xcite .",
    "more recently a new class of systems has emerged and started receiving similar systematic attention : entangled solutions and melts of unconcatenated and unknotted circular ( ring ) polymers  @xcite .",
    "why are ring polymers so special and , as we will shortly see , challenging ? according to current theoretical understanding , linear polymers in entangled solutions follow ( quasi ) ideal statistics because of screening of excluded volume  @xcite at large scales , while ring polymers do not display such an analogous `` compensation '' mechanism and tend to crumple into compact configurations  @xcite . at odds with their linear counterparts then , topological constraints affect not only the dynamical properties of rings in solution but they also have consequences on their properties at equilibrium .",
    "last but not least , the physical behaviour of ring polymers in solution has revealed intriguing connections to the experimentally observed behaviour of chromosomes inside the nuclei of the cells  @xcite . in spite of the considerable theoretical and experimental work which have been already dedicated to the subject , there are still several features of ring polymers in solution which wait to be examined in more detail .    in this article ,",
    "we present a systematic numerical investigation concerning the equilibrium and dynamical properties of ring polymers in solution , either as a function of ring size or solution density .",
    "the latter aspect , in particular , has received less attention in the past and this work intends primarily to start filling this gap . for comparison , we also discuss the same properties for corresponding entangled solutions of linear chains . as a result",
    ", we confirm that while linear chains statistics remains _ nearly _ gaussian in the long - chain limit _ at all densities _ , rings tend to crumple becoming more and more compact as density increases .",
    "nonetheless , and interestingly , we prove that increasing the density has also non negligible , measurable effects for contact frequencies in linear chains .",
    "we discuss polymer dynamics , showing that chains and rings of the same size have different relaxation times , with rings relaxing faster .",
    "then , we conclude the work by addressing the issue of how chain structure affects diffusion of non - sticky colloid particles .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : modmethods ] , we describe the details of the computational methods employed in this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present and discuss the results of our work . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concls ] we outline the conclusions .",
    "linear and ring polymers in solution are described according to the kremer and grest  @xcite polymer model .    excluded volume interactions between beads ( including consecutive ones along the contour of the chains ) are modelled by the shifted and truncated lennard - jones ( lj ) potential : @xmath0 & \\ , r \\le r_c \\\\ 0 & \\ , r > r_c \\end{array } \\right . \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the separation between the bead centers .",
    "the cutoff distance @xmath2 is chosen so that only the repulsion part of the lennard - jones is used .",
    "the energy scale is set by @xmath3 and the length scale by @xmath4 , both of which are set to unity in our simulations .",
    "consistent with that , in this work all quantities will be reported in these reduced lj units .",
    "nearest - neighbour monomers along the contour of the chains are connected by the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) potential , given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the spring constant and @xmath7 is the maximum extension of the elastic fene bond .    in order to maximize mutual chain interpenetration at relatively moderate chain length  @xcite and hence reduce the computational effort ,",
    "we have introduced an additional bending energy penalty between consecutive triplets of neighbouring beads along the chain in order to control polymer stiffness : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the angle formed between adjacent bonds and @xmath10 is the bending constant . with this choice ,",
    "the polymer is equivalent to a worm - like chain with kuhn length @xmath11 equal to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "colloid - monomer and colloid - colloid interactions are described by the model potentials introduced by everaers and ejtehadi  @xcite .",
    "the total interaction energy between colloid particles at center - to - center distance @xmath1 can be represented as the sum of two functions : @xmath13 @xmath14 is the attractive component and it is given by : @xmath15 \\ , .\\ ] ] the repulsive component of the interaction , @xmath16 , is : @xmath17 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in previous formulas , @xmath18 is the colloid particle radius and the constant @xmath19 = 39.478 @xmath20  @xcite . as we are interested to model hard - sphere colloids , the interaction is truncated at its minimum value of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the interaction energy , @xmath22 , between a single monomer and a colloid particle with center - to - center distance @xmath1 is given by : @xmath23 & r \\le r_{\\mathrm{mc } } \\\\",

    ", we consider polymer solutions consisting of @xmath26 circular ( ring ) or linear chains made of , respectively , @xmath27 beads each . the total number of monomers is then fixed to @xmath28 units .",
    "each polymer solution includes also @xmath29 colloid particles of diameter @xmath30 . the volume of the simulation box accessible to chain monomers has been chosen in order to fix the monomer density @xmath31 to the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    the static and kinetic properties of chains and colloids are studied using fixed - volume and constant - temperature molecular dynamics simulations ( nvt ensemble ) with implicit solvent and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "md simulations are performed using the lammps package  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using a velocity verlet algorithm , in which all beads are weakly coupled to a langevin heat bath with a local damping constant @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lennard - jones time and @xmath36 is the conventional mass unit for monomer and colloid particles .",
    "the integration time step is set to @xmath37 .",
    "_ linear polymers _  solutions of _ linear _ chains and colloid particles were prepared first at @xmath38 .",
    "linear chains were arranged as random walks in space and placed at random positions inside the simulation box .",
    "random positions were also chosen for colloid particles . in order to remove possible overlaps between chain monomers and between those and colloid particles , a short ( of the order of a few @xmath39 s ) md run with capped , soft ( _ i.e. _ non - diverging ) repulsive interactions between monomers and between monomers and colloids was used .    _ ring polymers _  this first setup is not suitable for ring polymers which needs to satisfy the supplementary constraint of avoiding mutual concatenation .",
    "hence , ring polymers were initially arranged in a very large simulation box , _ i.e. _ at very dilute conditions .",
    "in order to reach the correct monomer density of @xmath38 we performed then a short ( about @xmath40 md steps ) simulation by imposing an external pressure on the system which shrinks the simulation box until it reaches the desired value .    for both systems of linear and circular chains ,",
    "higher densities were obtained by compressing the solutions by means of higher external pressures .",
    "of course , during this preparatory phase the complete set of interaction terms described in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] was employed .",
    "once the system was prepared at the chosen density , we switched to the nvt ensemble .",
    "polymer solutions with chain sizes of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 beads were simulated for run times of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . unless otherwise stated , chain properties at equilibrium were always calculated on the last tenth of the corresponding trajectory .    in order to check for system equilibration ,",
    "we have monitored  @xcite the mean - square displacement of chain monomers in the absolute frame ( @xmath47 ) and in the frame relative to the chain centre of mass ( @xmath48 ) , and the mean - square displacement of the chain centre of mass ( @xmath49 ) at lag - time @xmath50 .",
