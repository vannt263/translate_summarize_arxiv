    "we first measured the daytime seeing by projection of the solar image on a regular grid during a drift - scan observation.[@xcite ] the transit of the solar limbs above the grid are recorded , and the time intervals required to cover the evenly spaced intervals of the grid are measured by a frame by frame inspection of the video .",
    "the standard deviation of these time intervals @xmath0 [ s ] is related to the seeing @xmath1 [ arcsec ] by the approximate formula : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the declination of the sun at the moment of the observation .",
    "the frequency of the seeing depends on duration of these time intervals : we used 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 times the single space , to sample the first 4 frequencies at the 6.3 cm lucernaria lenses in santa maria degli angeli in rome:[@xcite ] they are fixed in the dome and they have a focal lenght of 20 m.    these measurements have been extended to more frequencies at the 45 cm telescope of irsol and at the 10 cm huariou solar station s smat telescope .",
    "the role of seeing fluctuations between 1/10 and 1/100 of hertz is crucial in drift - scan measurements of the solar diameter , either meridian transits or almucantarat transits .",
    "this study firstly evidenced this effect in a clear way .    the seeing effect results in blurring + image deformation + image motion . in our case",
    "the effect has been detected by fitting an arch of circle to a @xmath4 sector of the solar limb : the image motion concerns the whole figure of the sun . for lucernaria lenses the diffraction limited the detectable amplitude of the seeing to 2.3 arcsec for @xmath5 nm , while at irsol and at huariou the observed fluctuations are real since this limit is respectively 0.2 and 1 arcsec .",
    "it follows that during a drift - scan the timing of the transit is affected by a movement of the whole image which add itself to the drift .",
    "a full sun imager with a field of view of @xmath6 solar radii , always in the drift - scan mode , has to monitor that slow image motion of the whole disk",
    ". the residual of this global motion with respect to the unperturbed , theoretical motion , integrated over the drift time , will give the correction to the drift time of the solar disk across a fixed hourly or altitude circle in the sky .",
    "the difference between two following measurements of the solar diameter always experienced with drift - scan method,[@xcite ] can be explained by the identification of this slow image motion of the whole solar disk with 1 arcsec amplitude .",
    "this can also explain the need of averaging over several measurements to give a reference value for the solar diameter in a given day .",
    "but different meteorological conditions , even in the same day , occur during the measurements and they can not be considered as statistically independent , as the gaussian hypothesis requires .",
    "that is one of the reasons to explain the great scatter of the yearly averages published from greenwich and capitol observatory.[@xcite ]            cuevas , s. , qualgliata , n. , sigismondi , c. , chapa , o. , perez , f. , tinoco s. 2011 _ santa maria degli angeli lucernaria prismatic lenses _ , 22nd general congress of the international commission for optics , abstract n. 2285348 , r. rodriguez - vera and r. diaz - uribe editors , puebla , mexico ( 2011 ) ."
