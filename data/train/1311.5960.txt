    "signals confirmed by atlas and cms@xcite showed that the higgs boson@xcite in the standard model ( sm ) have been found and the sm is most likely to be a precise theory at the present energy scale . new physics beyond the sm at higher energy scale",
    "is mostly concerned nowadays and in the near future .",
    "however , many difficulties are still alive in practical analysis of hadron physics involving nonperturbative qcd effect when we study hadronic phenomena at low energy , or @xmath2 scale .",
    "a typical method to solve the nonperturbative difficulties in qcd is factorization , in which the nonperturbative part is included into the wave function , such as the parton distribution functions for inclusive processes , fragmentation distribution functions for the hadronization , and the distribution amplitudes for exclusive processes .",
    "specifically , in theoretical investigations of the hard exclusive processes @xcite and hadronic physics with the qcd light - cone sum rule method @xcite , the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) are fundamental ingredients to be studied . furthermore , when searching for new physics beyond the sm , it is an important way to study flavor physics , in which some processes that are sensitive to the new physics can be measured more precisely nowadays than any time before .",
    "all of these require detailed information of the internal structure and the dynamical properties of the hadron , which are dominated by the nonperturbative qcd characters .    in the past decades , many efforts have been made in the descriptions of mesons@xcite and the nucleon@xcite , whereas , theoretical studies of a large number of the hadron physics phenomena require us to know lcdas of many other hadrons such as the octet baryons , the decuplet baryons , and some excited hadron states that are difficult to be determined experimentally at present . we have examined the lcdas of the strange octet baryons in the previous work@xcite in the conformal spin expansion method@xcite .",
    "our calculation concerns lcdas to twist-@xmath1 to the accuracy of the leading order of conformal spin expansion .",
    "the obtained parameters are also used to analyze some hadronic physics processes as applications@xcite .",
    "however , some of the investigations@xcite have implied that corrections from the higher order conformal spin contributions may affect the results to some extent .    in the point view of applications , an important effect to",
    "the lcdas is the correction of the higher twist distribution functions .",
    "the higher order twist contributions to lcdas have several origins , among which the main one comes from `` bad '' components in the wave function and in particular of components with `` wrong '' spin projection for the case of baryons @xcite .",
    "compatible with the previous works , we focus on higher order twist contributions from bad components in the decomposition of the lorentz structure in this paper .",
    "one of the general descriptions of lcdas is based on the conformal symmetry of the massless qcd lagrangian dominated on the light cone .",
    "the conformal partial wave expansion of the lcdas can be carried out safely in the limit of the @xmath3-flavor symmetry approach . however , when terms connected with the @xmath4-quark mass are considered , the @xmath3-flavor breaking effects need to be included . in the present work ,",
    "effects from the @xmath3-flavor symmetry breaking are considered as the corrections , which originate from two sources : isospin symmetry breaking and corrections to the nonperturbative parameters .",
    "it is known that the leading order contribution with the conformal spin expansion approach comes from the properties of the matrix elements of the local three - quark operator between the vacuum and the baryon state .",
    "thus , it is natural that higher order corrections should be related to the expansion of the matrix elements of the nonlocal three - quark operator at the zero point .",
    "however , we still need to estimate how much the contributions from four - particle effects will do on the result .",
    "fortunately we have known that for processes whose dominant contribution is from the light cone the four - particle contributions can be safely omitted in the lower leading order .",
    "thus , in the following analysis we only consider contributions from three - quark operator matrix element , whose higher moment is calculated with qcd sum rules@xcite .    as applications ,",
    "the light - cone qcd sum rule method has been used to examine processes related to the strange octet baryons and give instructive estimates @xcite . in the previous works",
    ", we have analyzed some physical processes related to the final states about the @xmath5 baryon .",
    "the results are compatible with the experiments and(or ) the other theoretical predications@xcite . nevertheless , there are still some processes which are not well described @xcite .",
    "we wish the higher order corrections from the higher conformal spin may give us more accurate estimates .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the sum rule of one coupling constant @xmath6 is analyzed in appendix [ app:2 ] as an example to elucidate the principal process of this method , and the other sum rules can be carried out in the same way .",
    "matrix elements of the quark - quark or quark - gluon - quark field operator between vacuum or hadron states are the great important ingredients in analysis of processes in quantum field theory .",
    "light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath5 baryon are defined by the general lorentz expansion of the matrix element of the nonlocal three - quark - operator between the vacuum and the baryon state @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents @xmath9 or @xmath10 quark , which correspond to @xmath11 or @xmath12 baryon , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath13 refer to lorentz indices and @xmath14 represent color ones .",

    "thus in this paper we do not show them explicitly .",
    "taking into account the lorentz covariance , spin and parity properties of the baryons , the matrix element ( [ matele ] ) is generally decomposed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spinor of the baryon with the quantum number @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the isospin , @xmath21 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath22 is the parity ) , @xmath23 are certain dirac structures over which the sum is carried out , and @xmath24 are the independent distribution amplitudes which are functions of the scalar product @xmath25@xcite .",
