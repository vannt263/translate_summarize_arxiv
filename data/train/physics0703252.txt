    "wire models @xcite are popular to describe molecular configurations where electrons are allowed to move almost freely along quasi one - dimensional structures , as is the case e.g. with the dislocated @xmath1-electrons in organic chain molecules @xcite .",
    "studies comparing these models with ab - initio electronic configuration calculations @xcite show that , in spite of their simplicity , these models succeed in reproducing many qualitative features and yield even quantitatively reasonable results .    in the present article",
    "we discuss a simple wire model which aims at describing small chiral molecules , and in particular the dependence of the chiral nature on their electronic susceptibilities .",
    "the latter determine important molecular properties such as the optical activity and the dispersion forces acting between molecules .",
    "while the chiroptical properties have already been subject of several publications @xcite , the present article is focused on the dispersion forces .    in general",
    ", it is a difficult task to calculate the dispersive interaction potential strengths between chiral molecules ( with few or no symmetries ) and other polarizable particles if one has to go beyond the bulk van - der - waals force @xmath2 .",
    "this is the case , e.g. if one needs to assess the relative strength of chirality - discriminative part of the interaction versus the non - discriminative ones .",
    "the reason is that multipole - multipole polarizabilities are required on the whole imaginary frequency spectrum for calculating the higher order dispersion constants which are linear combinations of integrals @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the polarizabilities for molecules a and b , respectively , in spherical tensor notation , see eq .",
    "( [ def : multipolepolar ] ) below .",
    "the van - der - waals dispersion constant @xmath6 depends on the electric - dipole - electric - dipole polarizabilities of both molecules ( @xmath7 ) . while it does not discriminate between the left- and right - handed configurations of an oriented chiral molecule , higher order dispersion interactions differ in general for left and right configurations .",
    "often , a rotational average over all orientations of the chiral molecule cancels this left - right distinction in the cross sections .",
    "however , consider a coherent superposition of the left- and right - handed configuration states @xcite , which will be subject to decoherence due to collisions with the atoms of a surrounding gas . in this case , the decoherence process is determined by collisions of spherical gas atoms b off _ the oriented _ chiral molecule a. here , the lowest order discriminative interaction with b ( @xmath8 ) is given by the electric - dipole - electric - quadrupole polarizability @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the resulting dispersive interaction depends on the distance @xmath11 between the molecules as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we will focus on this dominant discriminative interaction below , motivated by the above - mentioned question of collisional decoherence .",
    "we note that there might be additional forces of comparable strength which do not discriminate left and right , and that only non - retarded forces are considered in the following . for a discussion of retarded interaction between chiral molecules , see @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the present model is therefore to provide a minimalist , while consistent and trustworthy model for the bulk electronic properties of chiral molecules . in particular , we give explicit and closed results for the rotatory power , the electric - dipole - electric - dipole polarizability , and the electric - dipole - electric - quadrupole polarizability , both at imaginary frequencies .",
    "the simplicity of the model even admits the calculation of further higher multipole - multipole polarizabilities with small effort .",
    "the model is specified by two parameters , the length @xmath13 determining the bulk polarizability and the twist angle @xmath14 , which corresponds to the dihedral angle in a molecule , see fig .",
    "[ fig : wire3d ] . by choosing the parameters to represent the chiral dihydrogen disulfide , h@xmath0s@xmath0",
    ", we obtain reasonable values for its various electronic properties , suggesting that the model may serve as a good approximation for a typical small chiral molecule . yet , the aim here is of course not to reproduce precise numbers , but to have an easily accessible , consistent and plausible description of the dependence of the electronic susceptibilities on the molecular parameters , and in particular on the dihedral angle .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows .",

    "it has an angle of @xmath34 with respect to the @xmath35-axis .",

    "first we fix the length parameter @xmath13 by the sum of the binding lengths of the molecule which is found to be 8.6 @xmath173 .",
    "the twist angle in the wire model is chosen to be @xmath174 which is a good approximation of the dihedral angle in the molecule .    to fix the effective charge @xmath175 we consider the static ( i.e. , @xmath176 ) values for the electric - dipole - electric - dipole polarizability @xmath177 au , @xmath178 au , and @xmath179 au . the values of @xmath180 and @xmath181 as function of @xmath160",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gplusminus ] .",
    "a comparison with the lorentzian @xmath182 from ( [ def : ga ] ) , which has a width of 3 and a strength of 84.2 , shows that the latter dominates the polarizability tensor .",
    "the rotational average of the static polarizability for @xmath183 is then given by @xmath184 here the contribution of @xmath185 dominates the average static polarizability . a comparison with the literature value @xcite for @xmath131 of about 31 au results in @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "the dominant discriminative dispersion interaction between an oriented chiral and an achiral atom or molecule depends on the electric - dipole - electric - quadrupole polarizability tensor @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dipole matrix elements , it is determined by the matrix elements quadratic in the coordinate operators , @xmath188 , discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : electricquad ] .    for the calculation of dispersion constants it is preferable to consider polarizability tensors for imaginary frequencies in spherical representation @xmath189 with the spherical multipole functions @xmath190 for the electric - dipole - electric - quadrupole polarizability",
    "the multipole operators have ranks @xmath191 and @xmath192 , @xmath193 the required matrix elements can be found in ( [ sphericaldipol ] ) and ( [ sphericalquad ] ) . obviously , the polarizability @xmath194 transforms under parity operation like a product of three coordinates , @xmath195 , which results in an overall negative sign .",
    "thus , the dispersive interaction derived from it discriminates left - handed and right - handed molecules . finally , it should be noted that the electric - dipole - electric - dipole polarizability @xmath196 does not depend on the choice of the origin , while the electric - quadrupole - electric - dipole polarizability @xmath197 does @xcite .",
    "as an illustration for the use of the polarizability tensors , let us evaluate the interaction potential between a helium atom in ground state and the twisted arc .",
    "its calculation requires the electric - dipole - electric - dipole polarizability of helium . since helium is spherically symmetric only a single element of the spherical polarizability tensor",
    "does not vanish , namely @xmath198 . for our purposes",
    "it suffices to approximate the helium polarizability by @xmath199 with @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( atomic units ) , which is a good approximation for frequencies well below the excitation energy @xcite .    after evaluating the integrals ( [ polarintegrals ] )",
    "the dispersion potentials can be calculated following the theory in @xcite by disregarding retardation effects .",
    "they assume the form @xmath202 with @xmath203 the distance vector between helium atom and the center of mass , and @xmath204 . for simplicity , we take the center of mass to lie in the origin .",
    "the potential strength @xmath205 is calculated using the spherical dipole - dipole polarizability tensor , @xmath206 , of the twisted wire model which is readily obtained from the cartesian polarizability ( [ generalalpha ] ) . the calculation of @xmath207 uses the dipole - quadrupole tensor ( [ dipolequadrupoletensor ] ) .    to compare the interaction potentials we consider the surface of equality",
    ", @xmath208 thus , at distances @xmath209 the strengths of the potentials are related by @xmath210 .",
    "since the potential strengths are linear combinations of the polarizabilities @xmath211 is proportional to @xmath13 . at the same time",
    ", the dependence on @xmath175 cancels out .",
    "figure  [ fig : relativestrength ] shows @xmath212 for twist angles @xmath213 and @xmath183 at @xmath148 .  here",
    ", the direction of the helium atom , @xmath214 , is specified with respect to the symmetry axis of the twisted wire ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiredetails ] ) . the azimuthal angle ( with respect to the @xmath23-axis )",
    "is chosen to be @xmath215 .",
    "negative values of @xmath212 indicate that @xmath216 is repulsive . as can be seen",
    ", the achiral cis - configuration @xmath26 is anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath217 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "this is the case for all @xmath218 , and it is a consequence of the additional reflection symmetry for a planar configuration . for the other achiral situation , @xmath21 ( the trans - configuration ) ,",
    "the potential strength @xmath151 vanishes identically , @xmath219 . for all pairs of left- and right - handed configurations , @xmath220 ,",
    "the surfaces of equality can not be transformed into each other by a proper rotation .",
    "thus , unlike @xmath221 , the @xmath222 interaction does distinguish between right- and left - handed form , the difference depending on both the distance @xmath209 , and the orientation @xmath223 .",
    "we described a minimalist model for chiral molecules , which , in spite of its simplicity , admits a physically plausible and consistent description of their chiral properties . as a big advantage of this twisted arc model",
    ", the evaluation of higher order electric moments can be reduced to a small number of simple functions given in closed form . this way the functional dependence of the multipole polarizabilities on the frequency and on the model parameters shows up transparently .",
    "the derived chiral properties , such as the rotatory strength and the dispersive interaction potentials , thus display a simple , while physically consistent dependence on the model parameters .",
    "this was demonstrated , specifically for the dihedral angle , by evaluating the chirality - distinguishing part of the dispersive interaction with a polarizable atom for molecular parameters adopted to the dihydrogen disulfide molecule .",
    "the comparison with the dominant bulk interaction thus permits to assess to what degree right- and left - handed , oriented molecules can be distinguished by the dispersion interaction ."
