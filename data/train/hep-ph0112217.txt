    "studies of deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) have played a fundamental role in establishing qcd as the strong interaction theory and in exploring the parton structure of the nucleon . with the advent of hera ,",
    "in which electrons or positrons of 27.5 gev energy collide with protons of 820 gev ( in the last years 920 gev ) , the tests of qcd have been extended by several orders of magnitude with respect to the range in bjorken-@xmath4 and in @xmath5 , the squared momentum transfer between lepton and nucleon .",
    "the early fixed target experiments observed scaling violations , i.e. the variation of the structure functions with @xmath5 .",
    "the scaling violations are well described by qcd , in which they are related to the gluon density in the proton , and to the strong interaction coupling constant , @xmath1 .    at hera the low @xmath4 region",
    "was experimentally explored for the first time , and the first measurements@xcite of the proton structure function @xmath6 revealed a steep rise of @xmath2 towards low @xmath4 values . indicating a high gluon density in the proton at low @xmath4 .",
    "a key question is then the validity of the dglap evolution equations@xcite at low @xmath4 values , since in the dglap evolution higher order terms proportional to @xmath7 are neglected .",
    "one expects that at some value of @xmath4 non - linear gluon interaction effects will become important , damping the rise of the cross section in accordance with unitarity requirements .",
    "while this question can not yet be answered , the low  @xmath4 region remains a key area for future qcd studies at hera .",
    "figure 1 : diagram for lowest order @xmath0 dis    at the same time as precision measurements of the inclusive dis cross section and the proton structure functions are being pursued , qcd tests of processes of higher order in @xmath1 are also being investigated .",
    "these tests involve the study of jet production in dis , a field for which hera is well suited with its large @xmath0 cms energy @xmath8 gev .",
    "this experimental work is intimately connected with theory development , since tests of higher order jet production need the corresponding processes to be quantitatively estimated .",
    "inclusive @xmath0 neutral current ( nc ) dis is to lowest order , @xmath9 , described by the diagram in fig .  1 , in which a virtual boson is emitted by the electron and scatters off a parton in the proton . in the one - photon exchange approximation , the double differential cross section can be written as    @xmath10    the inelasticity @xmath11 represents the energy fraction transferred to the proton in the scattering process . @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the ( unpolarized , electromagnetic ) proton structure functions and contain the information about the momentum distribution of partons in the proton . they are not calculable in theory and have to be measured",
    ". however , when measured at a given @xmath5 value , their evolution in @xmath5 can be predicted in theory .",
    "the nc dis cross section can also be written as    @xmath12    where the @xmath0 scattering process is considered as the interaction of a flux of virtual photons with the proton . here",
    "@xmath13 is the flux factor and @xmath14 defines the photon polarization . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the cross sections of the interaction of transverse and longitudinally polarized photons with the proton .",
    "these cross sections are related to the structure functions :    @xmath17  and   @xmath18    due to cross section positivity , the relation @xmath19 is obeyed .    in the qpm world , without gluons , @xmath20 , since longitudinally polarized photons do not interact with massless spin 1/2 partons .",
    "thus , in qpm also @xmath21@xcite . in qcd quarks radiate gluons and interact through gluon exchange .",
    "radiated gluons in turn can split into quark - antiquark pairs ( `` sea quarks '' ) or gluons . the gluon radiation results in a transverse momentum component of the quarks , which can now also couple to longitudinally polarized photons .",
    "thus , @xmath16 and @xmath3 get non - zero values . due to its origin , @xmath3 is directly dependent on the gluon distribution in the proton and therefore the measurement of @xmath3 provides a sensitive test of qcd at low @xmath4 values .",
    "in fact , the low  @xmath4 region can not be understood without measuring @xmath3 precisely .",
    "figure 2 : @xmath2 vs @xmath5 , for fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "data from zeus and fixed target experiments .",
    "the curves show the nlo qcd fit to the data .",
    "the @xmath0 cross section is usually written in the `` reduced '' form , in which the @xmath5 dependence due to the photon propagator is removed ,    @xmath22    since the contribution of the longitudinal structure function @xmath3 to the cross section can be sizeable only at large values of @xmath23 , in a large kinematic range the relation @xmath24 holds to a very good approximation .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have recently presented high statistics measurements@xcite of the nc dis cross section and extracted @xmath2 in the kinematic range @xmath25  gev@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the zeus data are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the strong ( positive ) scaling violations at low @xmath4 values , due to the increase of the gluon density ( @xmath28 at low @xmath4 ) , are clearly seen . at large @xmath4 values",
    "negative scaling violations appear ( @xmath29 at large @xmath4 ) .",
    "the zeus and h1 data are in very good agreement , both with each other and , at the largest @xmath4 values where data overlap , with the earlier fixed target experiments .",
    "both collaborations have subjected their @xmath2 data to extensive qcd analyses in next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) , extracting the parton density functions ( pdfs ) and @xmath1@xcite .",
    "while the general analysis and fit strategy is similar in both collaborations , there are also many differences in the details , e.g. in the density parametrizations and in the treatment of flavour number and in the use of the fixed target data .",
    "an extensive discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "2 shows that the nlo qcd fits , which are based on the dglap evolution , describe the data very well over no less than four orders of magnitude and down to surprisingly low @xmath5 of a few gev@xmath26 .",
    "the gluon density extracted in the nlo qcd fits is shown for both experiments in fig .  3 for three values of @xmath5 .",
    "within the error bands there is reasonable agreement . like @xmath2 , the gluon density increases towards low @xmath4 values , and the increase is steeper with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "figure 3 : gluon density for three different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the error bands show the experimental and ( for h1 ) also the total ( including theoretical ) uncertainty .",
    "figure 4 : @xmath1 values obtained in the nlo qcd analyses of @xmath2 data . also shown",
    "are @xmath1 values obtained in a recent nnlo analysis@xcite as well as other @xmath1 values obtained at nnlo level .",
    "the @xmath1 values obtained in the nlo fits of h1 and zeus are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in the h1 case also",
    "the error due only to the experimental uncertainty is shown .",
    "thus , the theoretical uncertainty dominates the total error .",
    "the major part of this error is due to the choice of renormalization scale , and to a lesser extent , also to the choice of the factorization scale .",
    "this is expected to change once next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) qcd calculations are available .",
    "4 also shows the result of a recent nnlo analysis of @xmath0 dis data@xcite , in which the moments of @xmath2 are fitted to obtain an impressingly small error on @xmath1 . comparing the @xmath0 dis",
    "@xmath1 result with the result obtained when using the more imprecise @xmath30 scattering data , or with the @xmath1 values obtained in nnlo for @xmath31-decays , @xmath32-decays , or in analysis of @xmath33 , it is obvious that the @xmath0 dis data are very competitive in precision determinations of @xmath1 . note that the analysis in @xcite used earlier data on @xmath2@xcite , and not yet the most recent , very precise data .",
    "both collaborations are working on further reduction of the experimental errors on the @xmath2 data , errors which are completely dominated by systematics , in particular the uncertainty on the calorimetric energy scale .",
    "clearly , theoretical progress is essential in order to profit from future , still better experimental precision in the @xmath2 data .",
    "a fully independent measurement of @xmath3 at hera , in a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , is only possible via a substantial variation of the beam energies ; at any given values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 the difference of the reduced cross section , measured at two values of the cms energy @xmath34 , is a direct measure of @xmath3 :    @xmath35 \\cdot f_l $ ] .",
    "figure 5 : reduced cross section vs. @xmath4 , for @xmath36 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the curves are due to the h1 nlo qcd fit and represent @xmath2 and the cross section .",
    "this measurement is not yet performed but is part of the hera  ii physics program@xcite . while waiting for this to happen",
    ", the h1 collaboration has performed several indirect extractions of @xmath3 .",
    "the methods of extraction are based on the direct measurement of the cross section in the high @xmath23 region , and on the extrapolation of the precise knowledge of @xmath2 at low values of @xmath23 , into the region of high @xmath23 .",
    "cross section measurements of the nc dis process in the high @xmath23 region pose a challenge to the hera experiments , since low energy ( down to 3 gev is achieved ) scattered electrons have to be triggered , identified and well measured .",
    "the detailed understanding of the detector and of the photoproduction background is essential and an important part of the measurement is therefore the improvement of both calorimetry and the detection of charged tracks in the h1 central and backward regions .",
    "the measurement of track charge and momentum at all scattering angles is particularly important in    estimating the amount and shape of the background from photon conversions ( with photons from the @xmath37 decay ) , through the identification of `` wrong '' charge electrons .",
    "two methods are used for the extraction of @xmath3 from the cross section measurements , namely the `` subtraction '' method applied at @xmath38 gev@xmath26 , and the `` derivative '' method , applied for @xmath39 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the subtraction method is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , showing the reduced cross section as function of @xmath4 at fixed @xmath36  gev@xmath26 . at the lowest @xmath4 values ( corresponding to high @xmath23 values )",
    "the cross section falls below the @xmath2 curve , extrapolated via the h1 nlo qcd fit .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is obtained from the difference @xmath40 .",
    "this method was first explored in @xcite and in the recent analyses , using data from 1996 - 97@xcite and 1998 - 2000@xcite , @xmath3 is extracted up to @xmath5 values of 700 gev@xmath26 .",
    "6 shows the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath3 , separately for @xmath41 and @xmath42 data .",
    "as it should be , @xmath3 is independent of the lepton beam .",
    "one also sees that @xmath3 is clearly different from the extreme possibilities , @xmath43 or @xmath44 . within the precent precision of the data there",
    "is good agreement with the qcd expectation , as projected using the h1 nlo fit .    in the second method of extracting @xmath3 ,",
    "the derivative of the reduced cross section with respect to @xmath45 is formed :    @xmath46    figure 6 : @xmath3 vs. @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , vs. @xmath4 , upper scale ) , for fixed @xmath47 , for @xmath41 and @xmath42 data .",
    "the curves show the h1 nlo qcd fit , obtained for several assumptions on @xmath3 .",
    "the shaded band shows the expectation for @xmath3 and its uncertainty from the qcd fit .    for @xmath48 the cross section",
    "derivative tends to the limit @xmath49 , neglecting the contribution from the derivative of @xmath50 . at largest @xmath23",
    "the @xmath50 contribution dominates the derivative of the reduced cross section @xmath51 .",
    "this is in contrast to the influence of @xmath50 on @xmath51 which is dominated by the contribution of @xmath2 for all @xmath23 .",
    "a further advantage of the derivative method is that it can be applied down to very low @xmath52 1 gev@xmath26 where a qcd description of @xmath6 is complicated due to higher order and possible non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the measured cross section derivative is shown in fig .",
    "7 as a function of @xmath23 , in several bins of @xmath5 . since for a given @xmath5 value , @xmath53 , and",
    "since @xmath54 is small for low values of @xmath5 , @xmath55 is linear in @xmath45 to good approximation .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "7 . in each @xmath5",
    "bin straight line fits were made to the de-    rivative data for @xmath56 0.3 .",
    "the line fits describe the data very well and the extrapolation of the straight line was taken to represent the contribution of @xmath2 at high @xmath23 .",
    "the small contribution of @xmath57 to the derivative was corrected for by using nlo qcd and the correction was included in the overall error of the measured @xmath50 .",
    "the derivative method was used in the analysis of the low @xmath5 data , both in the 1996 - 97 data@xcite and in the 1999 - 2000 data@xcite .",
    "since the latter data have higher @xmath58 beam energy , 920 gev as compared to 820 gev in the earlier data , the accessible @xmath4 range could be extended to even smaller values .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the h1 nlo fit is based on the 1996 - 97 data ; when using this fit in the analyses of the later data proper account was taken in order to correct for the difference in @xmath58 beam energy .",
    "figure 7 : measurement of @xmath59 vs. @xmath23 , in bins of @xmath5 .",
    "the curves represent the nlo qcd fit to the h1 1996/97 data for @xmath56 0.35 and @xmath60 3.5 gev@xmath26 , calculated for several assumptions on @xmath50 .",
    "figure 8 : longitudinal structure function @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 and in bins of @xmath5 , obtained by h1 and fixed target experiments .",
    "error bands are due to experimental ( inner ) and model ( outer ) uncertainties using the h1 nlo qcd fit to the h1 1996/97 data for @xmath56 0.35 and @xmath60 3.5 gev@xmath26 .    fig .",
    "8 gives an overview of the current h1 data on @xmath61 in the @xmath5 range @xmath62 gev@xmath26@xcite .",
    "the data extend the knowledge of @xmath3 into the region of low  @xmath4 , much beyond the range of the fixed target experiments .",
    "the increase of @xmath63 towards low  @xmath4 is consistent with the nlo qcd calculation , reflecting the rise of the gluon density in this region .",
    "the values of @xmath63 are thus severely constrained by the present data , unless there are deviations from the assumed extrapolation of @xmath2 into the region of large @xmath23 corresponding to the smallest  @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath3 has also been calculated in the zeus nlo qcd fit@xcite ; the calculation is consistent with the h1 data .",
    "figure 9 : diagrams for qcd compton and boson gluon fusion processes .    the fully inclusive dis process , shown in fig .  1",
    ", is of zero order in @xmath1 .",
    "there is direct sensitivity only to the quark pdf s , and the determination of @xmath1 and gluon density is indirect , via the scaling violations of @xmath2 , measured over a large range of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the dis processes shown in figs .",
    "9a and b , qcd compton ( qcdc ) scattering and boson gluon fusion ( bgf ) , are of order @xmath1 and due to the latter contribution there is direct sensitivity to the gluon density of the proton . at high enough energy ,",
    "the involved final state partons manifest as jets of hadrons .",
    "the multi - jet final state can be characterized by the jet mass , @xmath64 , and the variable @xmath65 .",
    "the dijet mass @xmath64 gives the cm energy of the boson - parton reaction and the fractional momentum @xmath4 ( the longitudinal momentum fraction of the proton carried by the parton specified by the pdfs ) is given by @xmath66 , which is much larger than @xmath67 if @xmath64 is large .",
    "two hard scales enter in these diagrams , @xmath5 and @xmath68 .",
    "studies of the dynamics of multi - jet production are usually performed in the breit frame , where the virtual boson interacts head - on with the proton@xcite . in lowest order , @xmath9 ,",
    "the parton from    the proton is backscattered into opposite direction , and no transverse energy is produced .",
    "thus , appearance of jets with large @xmath69 can only be explained by hard qcd processes of at least @xmath70 , and @xmath68 is then the physical scale at which e.g. hard gluon radiation is resolved .",
    "experimentally , jets are usually identified using a @xmath71 algorithm@xcite .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have recently presented high statistics studies of inclusive jet and dijet production in nc dis@xcite .",
    "the data span the kinematic range @xmath72  gev@xmath26 and @xmath73  gev .",
    "nlo qcd calculations in general describe the data very well , over almost the whole range of @xmath5 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "10 , showing the h1 inclusive jet cross section as function of @xmath68 and @xmath5 , and in fig .  11 , showing the zeus dijet cross section as function of @xmath5 .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the qcd calculations stems from the uncertainty in the choice of renormalization scale @xmath74 , which is taken either as @xmath75 or as mean jet transverse energy , @xmath76 .",
    "the uncertainty is largest for low @xmath5 values ( fig .",
    "11b ) , and cuts are made at 150 ( h1 ) and 470 ( zeus ) gev@xmath26 in the qcd analyses of the data .",
    "at large values of @xmath5 the experimental uncertainties are also smaller , and this is true as well for the hadronic ( parton - to - hadron ) corrections to the nlo calculations , as shown in figs . 10 and 11c .",
    "once the good agreement of the qcd calculation with the jet data has been established , one can proceed to perform a qcd analysis , determining @xmath1 and the gluon density .",
    "the analysis strategy is as follows :    1 .",
    "fit the jet data to the nlo qcd predictions , using pdfs obtained from global , external fits@xcite . with",
    "the pdfs externally fixed , there is only one free parameter , namely @xmath1 .",
    "note that the pdfs themselves depend implicitly on @xmath1 , and that this complication was properly taken into account in the fits . 2 .",
    "after establishing that the fitted @xmath1 value agrees well with other , external measurements , @xmath1 is fixed ( e.g. to the world average ) and the jet data are then fitted in order to extract the pdfs , in particular the gluon density of the proton .",
    "3 .   finally , a global , simultaneous fit of both @xmath1 and the pdfs can be performed .",
    "this would be a more independent test of qcd with the data .",
    "however , although in this global fit the quark pdfs emerge as identical to those resulting from the fit in step ( 2 ) , the simultaneous fit fails to produce meaningful results for @xmath1 and the gluon density .",
    "the reason is + figure 10 : inclusive jet cross section vs. @xmath68 , in several intervals of @xmath5 .",
    "also shown are nlo qcd calculations , with and without hadronic corrections . + figure 11 : dijet cross section vs. @xmath5 .",
    "the shaded band represents the calorimeter energy scale uncertainty .",
    "the curves show nlo qcd calculations for several choices of @xmath74 and proton pdf sets .",
    "b ) ratio data / theory showing in addition the effect of the theoretical scale uncertainty .",
    "c ) parton - to - hadron correction . + the strong anti - correlation between @xmath1 and the gluon density , which can be understood from the fact that in the phase space region considered , jet production is dominated by the gluon contribution , which enters in the cross section as the product @xmath77 .",

    "figure 13 : gluon density in the proton , determined in a combined qcd fit using inclusive dis , inclusive jet and dijet cross sections .",
    "the error band includes all experimental and theoretical uncertainties , also that of @xmath78 .",
    "both h1 and zeus have performed step  1 in this strategy , and the resulting @xmath1 measurements are shown in fig .",
    "note that the `` running '' of @xmath1 is here clearly seen in both scales , @xmath75 and @xmath68 , and the running is moreover seen within each single experiment .",
    "the running is consistent with the renormalization group equation ( rge ) .",
    "the comparison of the measurements with other hera measurements , and with the world average values is given in fig .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1 values obtained from the dis jet data agree very well with other measurements , in particular with measurements from processes which do not involve hadrons in the initial state , like @xmath79 annihilation to hadrons , can be taken as proof of the validity of perturbative qcd at nlo in dis jet production .",
    "step  2 in the strategy was performed by h1 , and the gluon density extracted from the data is shown in fig .  13 .",
    "the fit includes the combined cross sections of inclusive jet data , dijet data and inclusive dis .",

    "are    * the average subjet multiplicity in jets in charged current ( cc ) and nc events is found to be similar . since the jets in cc and nc dis are predominatly quark initiated , the similarity in jet substructure indicates that the pattern of parton radiation within a quark jet is independent of the specific hard scattering process . * in a dijet event sample , @xmath87-quark jets were tagged through the identification of a @xmath88 meson .",
    "the internal structure of the charm induced jets is found to be similar to that of the quark jets in nc dis .",
    "since the latter are dominantly light quark initiated , one can conclude that the evolution of the outgoing partons , which determines the internal structure of the jet , is independent of the hard subprocess from which the outgoing partons originate . * using the internal jet structure of the tagged , charm induced jets in the dijet event sample , and comparing with the internal jet structure of the total dijet sample , it was possible to extract the internal jet structure of gluon jets . the prediction of qcd , that gluon jets are broader , and contain more subjets , is nicely confirmed .",

    "note that the jets become narrower , and that the mean subjet multiplicity decreases as @xmath68 increases .",
    "the nlo qcd calculation describes both jetshape and mean subjet multiplicity well , but the calculation also varies strongly with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is thus clear that the jet substructure data can be used to determine @xmath1 .",
    "the method is similar to the one used in the qcd analysis of the inclusive and dijet data described above .",
    "external sets of pdfs are used , and the implicit dependence on @xmath1 in these sets is properly taken account of in the fitting .    the results of the @xmath1 determination using the jet substructure are shown in fig .  15 , together with other @xmath1 measurements from hera .",
    "these new measurements agree well with the others , which is proof of the consistency of the nlo qcd calculations also where the internal jet structure is concerned .    a general remark about the measurements in fig .",
    "15 can be made : the experimental errors in these measurements are small and comparable to the error on the world averages@xcite .",
    "the total errors on the @xmath1 measurements at hera are in fact everywhere dominated by the theoretical uncertainty . as already noted above , this situation is expected to change when nnlo calculations become available .",

    "this higher sensitivity to @xmath1 and the greater number of degrees of freedom of the three - jet final state allow the qcd predictions to be tested in more detail in three - jet production .",
    "the h1 collaboration has recently presented@xcite a study of dis three - jet events , covering the kinematic range @xmath92 gev@xmath26 and three - jet masses @xmath93 gev .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the cross section is shown in fig .  16a , together with qcd lo and nlo calculations , the latter with and without hadronic corrections .",
    "the nlo calculation , which is due to the recently available program nlojet@xcite , describes the data well over the whole kinematic range , as is also seen in the ratio of data to theory . in the latter plot",
    "are also shown the theory uncertainty due to variation of the gluon density , the renormalization scale @xmath94 and @xmath1 .",
    "as seen , at large @xmath95 gev@xmath26 the @xmath1 variation gives the largest uncertainty .",
    "since both dijet and three - jet production is dominated by gluon induced processes , the uncertainty of the gluon density can be minimized by taking the ratio @xmath96 of three - jet    and dijet cross sections , at the same values of @xmath4 and @xmath97 .",
    "it can be shown , using the qcd calculations , that dijet and three - jet production involves the same gluon fraction , at similar @xmath5 values .",
    "furthermore , many experimental and systematic errors cancel in the ratio . as is evident in fig .  16b , @xmath96 , which is directly proportional to @xmath1 ,",
    "is experimentally measured and theoretically calculated with small uncertainties over the whole @xmath5 range .",

    "the distributions show that the jets tend to be aligned with either the photon or    the proton , i.e. the bremsstrahlung nature of the process ( coherence property of qcd ) is confirmed .",
    "similar distributions were previously also observed by the zeus collaboration in three - jet photoproduction@xcite .",
    "the dis data are well described by nlo qcd and the dglap evolution , over a large range of @xmath5 and bjorken-@xmath4 .",
    "this is true for the inclusive dis cross section , with the structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as well as for the inclusive jet production and the exclusive dijet and three - jet production and for the internal structure of jets .    in many areas",
    "the data have reached a high experimental precision , and progress in the tests of perturbative qcd depends crucially on further progress in the theory , where the nnlo calculations for the dis processes are awaited .",
    "this is particularly true for the precision determination of @xmath1 at hera , using dis data , where the experimental precision is already at level with the error on the world average , and is expected to improve even further .",
    "the running of @xmath1 in accordance with the rge is seen within each single experiment , and in both hard scales , @xmath75 and @xmath68 .    some areas , like jets at highest @xmath5 and @xmath68 , and the three - jet final state , are still statistically limited .",
    "the hera ii running period will bring a huge improvement of statistics in the coming years .",
    "however , in the analyses described in this report , the experiments have in many cases so far only used the data taken in 1995 - 97 , which constitute only about 1/3 of the total hera  i data .",
    "the remaining 2/3 of the hera  i data , from the years 1998 - 2000 , is currently being recalibrated and reprocessed , and will soon be available .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the organizers for the warm and joyful atmosphere in a most interesting and remarkably well prepared conference .",
    "i also wish to thank my colleagues in h1 and zeus , for providing the data and results presented in this report and for all their help given to me .",
