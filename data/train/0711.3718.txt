    "<S> we propose the first continuous model with long range screening ( shadowing ) that described columnar growth in one space dimension , as observed in plasma sputter deposition . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a new continuous partial derivative equation with non - linear diffusion and where the shadowing effects apply on all the different processes .    </S>",
    "<S> plasma sputtering is a common process for film growth which often exhibits wide columns more or less close packed separated by thin deep grooves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this columnar growth mainly results from a shadowing instability@xcite , where the elevated parts of the surface are more exposed to the sputtering while they shadow the incoming particles to the lower parts . </S>",
    "<S> the modelization of this shadowing instability has been well described by probabilistic monte - carlo methods ( mc)@xcite and also with continuous models based on partial derivative equations ( pde)@xcite including the seminal work of bales and zangwill @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , both approach fail to describe at long times the strongly nonlinear columnar microstructures observed recently ( see @xcite for instance ) . in fact , although the continuous models gives tall and well separated columns at early time , only few sharp peaks remain later on@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> columnar structure using pde has already been obtained by gillet et al.@xcite but in that case no shadowing effect was taken into account ! on the other hand , discrete approaches using mc methods including shadowing have been developped and showed a fair description of the columnar structure , particularly through the formation of sharp column sides . however </S>",
    "<S> , these models can not avoid the coarsening of the columnar structures showing larger and larger plateau as time increases , in contrast with experimental observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is to present a new continuous non - local model which includes both non - linear shadowing and diffusion effects to simulate columnar - like growth . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two dimensional model where the one dimensional ( 1d ) surface described by @xmath0 is subjected to receive particles from all directions not shadowed by the surface itself . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is deduced from the models developped initially by bales and zangwill@xcite and by karunasiri et al @xcite :    @xmath1    where the deterministic deposition term @xmath2 is multiplied by the solid angle @xmath3 which modelizes the shadowing effect as a long range screening ( see figure [ mc2 - 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the diffusion / relaxation coefficient while @xmath5 is the usual noise with zero mean @xmath6 and its correlation given by @xmath7 . + for small surface angles , we retrieve a kpz - like equation @xcite with shadowing effects ( defining @xmath8 ) :    @xmath9     _ shadowing process : interface @xmath0 and solid angle @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> _ ]    a complete study of these equations has shown that it is unable to reproduce columnar shapes corresponding to experiments and mc simulations @xcite . indeed , in the most favourable situation , </S>",
    "<S> only broad peaks emerge instead of flat columns . </S>",
    "<S> experiments suggest thus that the diffusion should be enhanced in the region more exposed to the flux . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will assume that the flux also increases ( greater than for normal shadowing ) on the top of the columns compared to the grooves . </S>",
    "<S> although we have no strong argument for it , we expect some point effect near the sharp edge to be responsible of this process . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose the following stochastic differential equation where the main ingredients are non - linear shadowing effects and diffusion  :    @xmath10    in this equation @xmath11 is a given function of the solid angle @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to increase the shadowing effect and the diffusion from top to edges and bottom , @xmath11 has to be stronger than linear , and we will take later on for the numerics @xmath13 . the fact that this function , which modelizes the shadowing , is in factor to the right hand term will obviously increase the deposit rate for surfaces which are not shadowed ( mainly for large value of @xmath14 ) and make it smaller for shadowed one ( for small value of @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion is also affected by the shadowing in the same way . + a plane - wave analysis performed on equation ( [ eq2.0 ] ) shows that the solutions are unstable for large enough wavelengths @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and the growth rate @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> then , starting from a flat substrate , the noise will trigger the instability and will drive the system into a strong non - linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ shadow1 ] shows the evolution of the interface profile for different times for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits the desired columnar shape . </S>",
    "<S> this shape is characterised by flat column tops and vertical sides as compared to previous monte - carlo simulations and columnar growth experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowed deposition favors the columnar growth and the anisotropic diffusion smoothes the top of the column very efficiently and leads to vertical sides . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between these two effects leads to a columnar regime as expected . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , most of the columns formed at the beginning of the simulation are still present at the end . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case for `` poisson / wedding cakes '' morphologies for which initial columns always remains @xcite and for step meander process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + for numerical simulation , equation ( [ eq2.0 ] ) is integrated using the following explicit scheme :    @xmath22   \\label{eq3.0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the notation @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is a random number picked with the uniform distribution between @xmath25 . to obtain a discrete form of the gradient term , we follow the scheme proposed by lim _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> although their study strictly applied for the kpz equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is evaluated following reference @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of the roughness @xmath26 of the interface is given figure [ shadow3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it shows the existence of different regimes . the first one , for @xmath27 is driven by the fluctuations and @xmath26 scales as @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> for the second one ( @xmath29 ) , diffusion induced a relative reduction of the roughness which scales as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> then , because of the shadowing instability described above , sharp canyons appear and the roughness quickly increases . finally , after @xmath31 , the columnar regime appears which leads to @xmath32 as in the discrete model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even if @xmath33 shows the same scaling as obtained in previous studies on continuous columnar growth model @xcite , the column shapes are rather different and are now in closer agreement with the mc models and more important with the experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , experiments display relative constant column width , while mc simulations lead to a column width which is increasing with time . in that respect , </S>",
    "<S> our model ( [ eq2.0 ] ) exhibits a better qualitative agreement with experiement than mc simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the first continuous model , to our knowledge , that exhibits a columnar growth without the coarsening dynamics of the structures , in good agreement with experimental observations on sputtering deposition . for reproducing these wide flat columns with sharp edges </S>",
    "<S> , we have introduced an increase of the relaxation and of the flux on the top of the column compared to the grooves . by sake of simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> we have considered a 1d surface and we have taken the same non local and nonlinear multiplicative factor @xmath34 for all the terms of the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> further on , we have considered a simple power law behaviour for this function @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that @xmath36 is needed to enhance the shadowing effects on the protuberances . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested numerically @xmath37 and @xmath38 with no loss of properties of the results . however </S>",
    "<S> , a better choice of the shadowing function @xmath39 should be obtained through further experimental comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , different shadowing functions should be considered in the future for the diffusion term and the deposition term . </S>",
    "<S> finally , this new continuous model , with @xmath37 , considered as a minimal model , already correctly reproduces the formation of flat wide columns , with sharp edges and thin separating grooves , as usually encountered in sputtering deposition . </S>",
    "<S> further works should perform such approaches to two dimensional surfaces in particular . </S>"
