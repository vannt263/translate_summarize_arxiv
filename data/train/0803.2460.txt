    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , discovered by gallager @xcite , have been widely researched over the last decade and a half .",
    "asymptotic results are widely known for these codes , including results on the performance under maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding @xcite , average ensemble distance spectra @xcite , stopping set distributions @xcite , thresholds for iterative decoding using density evolution @xcite , and others . however , accurate finite - length analysis of ldpc codes under iterative sum - product decoding is currently available only for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "this is due to the simplicity of the channel model and the graph - based iterative decoder which lends itself to a more detailed analysis .",
    "analysis of the combinatorial properties of stopping sets and their contribution to the error performance reveals that the average error performance of the ldpc ensemble is proportional to the inverse of a polynomial in the block length @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the existence of `` bad '' codes which possess small stopping sets , and otherwise would decrease _ exponentially _ with @xmath0 if these codes were removed from the ensemble .",
    "fortunately , these `` bad '' codes constitute a small fraction of the entire ensemble whose size is proportional to the inverse of a polynomial in @xmath0 .    after removing the undesirable codes",
    ", we obtain an _ expurgated ensemble _ , for which there exists a positive error exponent . in @xcite ,",
    "lower bounds on this error exponent of typical codes in the regular and irregular ldpc code ensembles were derived . in this paper",
    "we obtain an upper bound on this exponent , and compare it with the above mentioned lower bounds .",
    "similar to @xcite , which considers upper bounds on the error exponent of ldpc codes under ml decoding , our bounds depend on some confidence level .",
    "the correspondence is organized as follows .",
    "section [ preliminaries section ] introduces notation and preliminary material .",
    "section [ upper bound on error exponent for the bec ] introduces a lower bound on the error ( erasure ) probability from which an upper bound on the exponent is derived .",
    "section [ numerical results ] introduces numerical results and comparisons with previous results .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we will use the following notation throughout the paper .    * let @xmath1 be a set of non - negative real numbers , such that @xmath2 .",

    "we prove in appendix [ proof of dawson s generalized ] .",
    "we consider the standard bipartite graph - based @xmath29-regular ldpc code ensemble with block length @xmath0 and design rate @xmath30 . in this ensemble",
    "a randomly chosen permutation is used to match the @xmath31 left sockets to the @xmath32 right sockets",
    ". the actual rate of the code is at least @xmath33 .",
    "recall that a _ stopping set _ @xmath34 of a bipartite graph representation of an ldpc code is a set of variable nodes , such that each check node neighbor of @xmath34 is connected to @xmath34 by at least two edges . as explained in @xcite , iterative decoding of ldpc codes succeeds if and only if the set of variable nodes which correspond to erasures does not contain a subset which is a stopping set .",
    "the _ expurgated _ @xmath29-regular ldpc ensemble @xmath35 is derived from the @xmath29-regular ensemble @xmath36 by removing all the codes containing stopping sets of size @xmath37 or less .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for ensembles with @xmath38 , if @xmath39 is selected below a certain threshold @xmath40 , then almost all codes in @xmath36 belong to @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , if @xmath41 is drawn at random from @xmath36 @xmath42 the number @xmath43 may therefore be considered to be the typical minimum stopping set size of @xmath36 . since the behavior of @xmath36 is dominated by a small fraction of `` bad '' codes , we will be interested in the performance of codes drawn at random from @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath41 be such a code .",
    "consider a bec with erasure probability @xmath44 ; the probability of unsuccessful decoding of any codeword from @xmath41 , @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 where the index @xmath47 runs over all sets of variable nodes containing exactly @xmath48 nodes ; for a particular set @xmath49 of @xmath48 variable nodes , @xmath50 is the event that the @xmath51th ( non - empty ) subset of @xmath49 ( where @xmath52 ) is a stopping set .",
    "note that every set of @xmath53 variable nodes contains the support of a nonzero codeword columns in the parity check matrix , regardless of how they are chosen , are linearly dependent ; this follows since the matrix has @xmath54 rows . ] .",

    "the number of sets of variable nodes of size @xmath48 containing @xmath34 as a subset is @xmath63 .",
