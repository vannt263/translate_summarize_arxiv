    "it has been known since the earliest observations of rich clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that galaxies which inhabit these high - density regions are quite distinct from the general field galaxy population .",
    "the cluster population is dominated by galaxies with early - type morphologies , primarily ellipticals and s0s , which have colours and spectral types consistent with their undergoing passive evolution .",
    "in contrast , the field population is dominated by actively star - forming galaxies generally of late morphological types , such as spirals and irregulars . explaining the segregation of galaxies into these two broad classes is one of the outstanding problems of extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
    "early work suggested that elliptical galaxies may have an intrinsically different formation process to disc galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since the general acceptance of the hierarchical process as the preferred model of structure formation ( see e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , much attention has been focused on mechanisms that could transform star - forming , late - type galaxies into passively evolving , early - type systems in dense environments .",
    "some examples of suggested evolutionary processes include : galaxy mergers  the results of numerical simulations suggest that the collision and merging of two equal mass disc galaxies can produce a product with properties typical of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ram - pressure stripping of gas from galaxies falling into clusters @xcite ; and galaxy harassment , where tidal forces strip disc galaxies to make dwarf spheroidal systems @xcite .",
    "modern large surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provide excellent quality data and have allowed the dependence of galaxy properties upon environment in the local universe to be examined in some depth in recent years . @xcite studied the environmental dependence of the galaxy star formation rate near clusters in the 2dfgrs and found that it converged to the field value beyond @xmath9 times the virial radius , indicating that relatively small increments in local density at the outskirts of clusters lead to a decrease in star formation rates .",
    "they found no dependence of the average star formation rate upon cluster velocity dispersion , a tracer of mass and hence a measure of the global environment .",
    "@xcite used the early data release of the sdss to study the galaxy star formation rate as functions of local galaxy density and clustercentric radius .",
    "they found that the star formation rate is strongly correlated with the local galaxy density .",
    "similarly to @xcite , @xcite also found that the star formation rate converges to the field value at clustercentric distances of 3 - 4 virial radii .",
    "@xcite extended these studies of ` galaxy ecology ' to groups , using both 2dfgrs and sdss data .",
    "they found little evidence that the distribution of the h@xmath10 line strength , an indicator of star formation rate , depends strongly upon environment amongst the actively star - forming galaxy population .",
    "similarly to both @xcite and @xcite , they also found that the fraction of galaxies with significant ongoing star formation decreased steadily with increasing density , and interpreted the persistence of this correlation at low densities as indicating that ram pressure stripping is not the only mechanism responsible for the truncation of star formation in galaxies .",
    "in addition , @xcite found little dependence of the star formation rate upon group velocity dispersion .",

    "in contrast , the lfs of star - forming galaxies were found to be essentially identical .",
    "dp03 also constructed lfs for a variety of cluster subsamples , divided by several environmental variables including richness , velocity dispersion , substructure , and b ",
    "m @xcite type , but found no evidence of differences in the derived lf parameters .",
    "however , one measure of the large scale cluster environment that dp03 were unable to test was cluster x - ray emission , which is produced from the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation of the hot intracluster gas ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is perhaps a better tracer of cluster mass than the velocity dispersion .",
    "there have of course been many other studies of the lf in different environments in recent years ; we refer the reader to the references of dp03 for details of these .    in this paper",
    "we seek to build upon the previous work described above and investigate the dependence of cluster galaxy populations upon the x - ray luminosity of the host cluster , by utilising the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey ( reflex ) catalogue @xcite in conjunction with galaxy data taken from the 2dfgrs .",
    "this subject is also being explored by the rass - sdss galaxy cluster survey @xcite , who have examined cluster scaling relations and galaxy luminosity functions for a sample of clusters selected from rosat x - ray observations , with galaxy photometry and spectroscopy drawn from the sdss .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the two datasets used in this survey , 2dfgrs and reflex . in section  [ s_lxsbi ] , we describe our initial method of correlating reflex and 2dfgrs data , and measure the relation between x - ray luminosity and cluster velocity dispersion . in section  [ s_reflexnonreflex ] , we supplement the reflex cluster sample with rich clusters taken from the catalogue compiled by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dp02 ) , and divide the combined cluster sample in x - ray luminosity .",
    "we describe the construction of composite cluster luminosity functions in section  [ s_lfs ] for low- and high-@xmath4 cluster subsamples , to complement the work of dp03 .",
    "finally , we end with a discussion of the results in section  [ s_discuss ] and our conclusions in section  [ s_conclude ] .    throughout",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "since the details of the 2dfgrs and reflex surveys have been covered in considerable depth elsewhere ( see in particular @xcite for the 2dfgrs , @xcite for reflex ) , here we only briefly review the gross characteristics of the datasets used in this paper .      the 2dfgrs is the largest completed spectroscopic survey of galaxies to date , covering approximately 1500 deg@xmath15 of the apm galaxy survey region @xcite , and contains spectroscopic information on approximately 250,000 galaxies down to a magnitude limit of @xmath16 .",
    "the survey area consists primarily of two strips : the sgp strip centred close to the south galactic pole , covering an area of @xmath17 , and the ngp strip in the northern galactic hemisphere that covers an area of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition there are 99 widely scattered random @xmath19 fields .",
    "the median redshift of the galaxies in the survey is @xmath20 , and up to this redshift the survey is @xmath21 per cent complete at the stated @xmath6 magnitude limit .    in this paper we restrict ourselves to spectra with a 2dfgrs quality flag @xmath22 .",
    "these galaxies have measured redshifts with an rms uncertainty of 85 km s@xmath2 . in our examination of galaxy populations ,",
    "we make use of the 2dfgrs @xmath23 parameter defined by @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is correlated with the present- to past - averaged star formation rate , and so passively - evolving galaxies have low values of @xmath23 , and the opposite is true for galaxies that have formed a significant fraction of their stars more recently . in this paper",
    "we take a simple approach to classifying galaxies using this parameter , adopting @xmath24 for early - type , passively evolving galaxies ( spectral type 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath25 for late - type , actively star - forming galaxies ( encompassing spectral types 2 - 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the following @xmath26-corrections for each population :    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the correction found for spectral type 1 galaxies by @xcite and @xmath30 is that found for spectral type 3 , an appropriate average to use for the late - types . the rms error on the 2dfgrs @xmath6-band photometry",
    "is 0.15 mag .",
    "reflex is the largest homogeneous catalogue of x - ray selected galaxy clusters assembled to date .",
    "reflex cluster candidates were selected from the region @xmath31 of the second processing of the rosat all sky survey ( rass ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , avoiding the crowded stellar fields of the magellanic clouds and the region @xmath32 either side of the galactic plane .",
    "reflex therefore covers the entire 2dfgrs region down to a nominal flux limit of @xmath33 erg s@xmath2 @xmath34 in the ( 0.12.4 kev ) energy band .",
    "the final catalogue @xcite contains 447 clusters with measured redshifts , and is @xmath35 per cent complete .    the mean fractional error on the measured reflex fluxes in the ( 0.12.4 kev ) band is 16.7 per cent .",

    "@xcite divided a sample of @xmath38 group and cluster galaxies into two subsamples of low-@xmath36 ( @xmath39 km s@xmath2 ) and high-@xmath36 ( @xmath40 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "they found marginal evidence that the fraction of star - forming galaxies was lower in the high-@xmath36 clusters relative to the low-@xmath36 groups at fixed local density .",
    "this is similar to the result we see for the low- and high-@xmath4 cluster samples studied in this paper , although we make no attempt to distinguish between the effects of variation in local galaxy density and the large scale cluster environment ( as traced by @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xcite also studied star - formation rates in 2dfgrs cluster galaxies as traced by the equivalent width of h@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite considered 17 clusters drawn from dp02 and divided their sample into clusters with @xmath41 km s@xmath2 and @xmath42 km s@xmath2 , with 10 and 7 clusters in each respective subsample .",
    "they found no dependence of galaxy star - formation rates upon the velocity dispersion of the host cluster , in contrast to the results that we obtain for our low- and high-@xmath4 cluster samples .",
    "this is perhaps due to the comparatively small size of the cluster sample used by @xcite .",
    "we present a comparison of our derived lf parameters with the values obtained from 2dfgrs data by dp03 for clusters and @xcite for the field in table  [ t_lfcomp ] , divided by spectral type and transformed to @xmath14 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 . here , spectral type 1 corresponds to our definition of early - type galaxies and spectral types 2 - 4 collectively form our sample of late - type galaxies . in this table",
    "we also quote average values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 for the late - type lfs of @xcite , weighted by the respective normalisation constants , to ease comparison with our late - type lf parameter values .",
    "the most surprising result of this work is the disagreement of the high-@xmath4 sample early - type lf parameter values with both the low-@xmath4 sample and the results of dp03 . @xmath11 and @xmath10 are both lower in the high-@xmath4 , early - type lf in comparison to the corresponding dp03 early - type lf at @xmath43 significance .",
    "the characteristic magnitude of the high-@xmath4 sample lf is also significantly lower than found in the field by @xcite , although the faint - end slope is steeper . in contrast ,",
    "both schechter function parameter values for the early - type lf of the low-@xmath4 sample are within @xmath44 of agreement with the results of dp03 , with @xmath11 brighter than in the field , and steeper @xmath10 .",
    "the late - type lf parameter values for the high-@xmath4 sample agree within @xmath45 of the type 2 and types 3 + 4 lfs of dp03 , and the weighted average of the field results of @xcite .",
    "there is therefore marginal disagreement ",
    "although note that there is no significant disagreement between the low- and high-@xmath4 late - type lfs .",
    "the low-@xmath4 sample late - type lf parameters are well within @xmath46 of agreement with the dp03 results and the @xcite field results .",
    "these results are therefore consistent with a picture in which the late - type lf varies little with environment .",
    "we are also able to compare our results to similar studies undertaken using sdss @xmath47-band data , following a suitable transformation to the @xmath48 band as used by the 2dfgrs , i.e. ,    @xmath49    as used by @xcite .",
    "we present results from @xcite for rass - sdss galaxy clusters , and @xcite for the field in table  [ t_sdsslfcomp ] .",
    "note that we assume a @xmath50 colour of 0.8 when converting the @xmath11 values using equation  ( [ e_g2bj ] ) , a value we estimated from inspection of the colour distribution of early spectral type 2dfgrs galaxies , after transforming the 2dfgrs @xmath48 and @xmath51 bands to sloan @xmath47 and @xmath52 using the prescriptions given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed lfs for a sample of 69 x - ray selected clusters drawn from the rass - sdss survey .",

    "in contrast , there is mild disagreement ( at the @xmath54 level ) between the characteristic magnitude of this lf and the value that we obtain for the low-@xmath4 sample lf for galaxies of all spectral types .",
    "however , our low-@xmath4 sample lf has a significantly flatter faint - end slope than this lf .",

    "it is appropriate to compare the lf values that we obtained in section  [ s_results ] with the bright component of the @xcite double - schechter function fits .",
    "we find in this case a much better agreement of our low-@xmath4 sample lf for galaxies of all spectral types , with the values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 in agreement within @xmath55 of each other .",
    "the agreement with the lf parameters we derived for the equivalent high-@xmath4 sample lf is also much closer  we find @xmath56 and @xmath57 in this case .",
    "@xcite also constructed lfs for galaxies divided into early and late types on the basis of their @xmath58 colour .",
    "because of uncertainties in the @xmath26-correction , they used a reduced sample of sixteen rass - sdss clusters located within @xmath59 .",
    "as table  [ t_sdsslfcomp ] shows , @xcite found a value of @xmath11 for the early - type galaxy lf intermediate between the values we obtained for our low- and high-@xmath4 cluster samples .",
    "in fact , both @xmath11 and @xmath10 for this lf are in good agreement with the values we obtain for our corresponding high-@xmath4 sample lf .",
    "the agreement with the low-@xmath4 sample lf is worse , but the @xmath11 values are still in agreement within @xmath46 , and the @xmath10 values differ at the @xmath60 level .",
    "however , for the late - type lf @xcite find a much brighter characteristic magnitude and steeper faint - end slope than we find for both our low- and high-@xmath4 cluster samples .",
    "we note that unlike the late - type lfs produced from 2dfgrs data by @xcite for the field , and both dp03 and the present work for clusters , @xcite obtain a brighter characteristic magnitude for the late - type lf in comparison to the early - type lf .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are not clear .",
    "it is prudent to look for selection effects that could explain the discrepancy between the early - type luminosity functions in our low- and high-@xmath4 cluster samples . in the case of the low-@xmath4 sample , which are almost all",
    "exclusively optically selected , we may worry that they are not in fact bound systems , in which case the effect of interloper galaxies on the derived lf parameters could be significant . to investigate the effect of changing the selection of cluster members in redshift space on the derived lf parameters , we constructed lfs using galaxies selected within @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 km s@xmath2 slices ( @xmath66 ) around each cluster redshift , within the previously calculated selection radius of @xmath5 ( i.e. instead of using @xmath67 the velocity dispersion to select cluster members ) .",
    "[ f_sbislices ] shows the resulting schechter function parameters , with 1@xmath68 statistical errors derived from bootstrap resampling , obtained using the same method as the results presented in section  [ s_lfs ] .",
    "we can see from this figure that the values of @xmath11 and @xmath10 are not significantly affected by this selection effect , remaining consistent with the results presented in section  [ s_results ] .",
    "we also considered the possibility that a selection effect could arise due to galaxy crowding in the centres of the high-@xmath4 clusters , because these objects are on average more distant than the low-@xmath4 clusters ( panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ f_sbidist ] ) .",
    "there are two possible sources of unaccounted - for incompleteness in this case : incompleteness in the parent apm galaxy catalogue , due to object blending ; and/or incompleteness in the 2dfgrs spectroscopic catalogue , due to fibre crowding . to determine the importance of this effect , we produced luminosity functions for the high-@xmath4 sample after excising galaxies within the central @xmath69 of each cluster .",
    "we present the lf for early spectral types in fig .",
    "[ f_coreless ] .",
    "the derived lf parameters ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) are clearly consistent with those obtained in section  [ s_results ] , and so we conclude that incompleteness effects of this type have no significant impact upon our results .    the physical aperture sampled by a 2df fibre naturally becomes smaller as redshift increases , and so the spectral type determined for a particular galaxy may have a mild redshift dependence .",
    "however , due to seeing effects and fibre positioning errors , the effect is likely to be small ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". nevertheless , we attempted to gauge the impact of the aperture bias by constructing lfs for both the low- and high-@xmath4 samples using only clusters located within a common redshift range of @xmath72 .",
    "of the high-@xmath4 cluster sample , only 8 clusters of the 19 are found in this redshift range , and we found the best fitting early - type lf parameters were @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the low-@xmath4 sample in this redshift range is made up of 39 clusters , for which the best fitting schechter function was specified by @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we therefore conclude from a comparison of these results with those for the full sample that the effect of fibre aperture bias is negligible .",
    "the faint - end of the high-@xmath4 sample is defined by relatively few clusters .",
    "in fact , at magnitudes fainter than @xmath77 , only 11 clusters contribute to the lf .",
    "although the early - type high-@xmath4 sample lf is made up from 17 per cent more galaxies than the equivalent low-@xmath4 lf , we may simply be unfortunate in that the faint - end behaviour of these 11 clusters is not typical of the rest of the sample . to address this concern",
    ", we performed a one - parameter fit to the early - type , high-@xmath4 sample lf , with the value of the faint - end slope fixed to that found for the low-@xmath4 sample , i.e. @xmath78 . the resulting lf is shown in fig .",
    "[ f_fixedalpha ] .",
    "although the value of @xmath11 for the best fit is now brighter than found from the two - parameter fit , we find that @xmath11 remains lower than the value obtained from the low-@xmath4 sample lf .",
    "this result is marginally significant , at the @xmath79 level ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this exercise confirms that the low - value of @xmath11 found for the high-@xmath4 cluster sample arises primarily from the deficit of early - type galaxies with @xmath8 ( panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ f_earlylfs ] ) , rather than from the behaviour of the faint - end of the lf .",
    "since simple selection effects are unable to explain our results , we now consider how the difference in the early - type lf parameters could be driven by environmental differences between the low- and high-@xmath4 clusters .",
    "other studies of the luminosity function using 2dfgrs data have found evidence to suggest that @xmath11 brightens and @xmath10 steepens with increasing galaxy density @xcite or mass @xcite .",
    "the results presented here seem to suggest that the opposite is true when considering the effect of increasing x - ray luminosity on the lf .",
    "it could therefore be suggested that the high-@xmath4 cluster sample is actually composed of low - mass , merging systems ",
    "@xmath4 is known to be a good tracer of mass , but the results of numerical simulations suggest that @xmath4 can be boosted during mergers .    for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) demonstrated that an equal mass merger with impact parameter @xmath81 ( i.e. a head - on collision ) can boost the bolometric x - ray luminosity of the resultant object by a factor of 5 - 6 .",
    "the boost in @xmath4 in this case lasts for approximately half a sound crossing time , @xmath53 gyr for the high-@xmath4 cluster sample . without knowledge of the merger histories of the individual high-@xmath4 clusters ,",
    "the impact of this effect is difficult to gauge .",
    "however , in the limiting case of all the high-@xmath4 clusters being boosted in @xmath4 by a factor of six , the median unboosted ( 0.12.4 kev ) x - ray luminosity of the sample is @xmath82 erg s@xmath2 . by comparison , for the majority optically - selected low-@xmath4 cluster sample",
    "the median maximum @xmath4 set by the reflex flux limit is @xmath83 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore even in this extreme case both samples would be of similar mass  rather than the high-@xmath4 clusters being significantly less massive .",
    "in addition , as shown in section  [ s_sampledefinitions ] , the median velocity dispersion of the high-@xmath4 sample is higher than that for the low-@xmath4 sample .",
    "these facts imply that the high-@xmath4 clusters are more likely to be higher mass systems than the low-@xmath4 clusters .",
    "we suggest that a consistent explanation of the results of sections  [ s_properties ] and  [ s_results ] can be achieved by a scenario in which the high-@xmath4 clusters are in general older , more dynamically evolved systems than the low-@xmath4 clusters . in this case , the higher fraction of early - type , passively evolving galaxies present in the high-@xmath4 sample comes about naturally from there being more crossing times available for infalling late - type galaxies to be converted into early - type galaxies within the cluster environment .",
    "this holds irrespective of the mechanism responsible for driving the transformation , whether it is by interactions with the intracluster medium ( as in ram - pressure stripping ) , or by interactions between cluster member galaxies ( as in the harassment scenario ) .",
    "the excess galaxies that we see at the very bright end of the high-@xmath4 cluster lf could be explained by these systems having a more extensive merger history than the low-@xmath4 clusters , as suggested by the results of @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a ` galactic cannibalism ' scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  where the brightest cluster galaxies grow by the accretion of the successively fainter members  could help to bring about the deficit of galaxies seen at @xmath8 in the high-@xmath4 sample , early - type lf , which seems to be the cause of the low - value of @xmath11 found in this case .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath26-band lfs of 93 galaxy clusters divided into two samples of low- and high - mass ( estimated from the x - ray temperature ) .",
    "although they found the high - mass lf had a brighter characteristic magnitude than the low - mass lf  in contrast to the results of this work for low- and high-@xmath4 clusters  they found a deficit of galaxies below @xmath11 in the high - mass sample in comparison to the low - mass lf .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) interpreted their result as an indication that a major contribution to the masses of the very brightest galaxies in clusters comes from mergers with other bright ( @xmath84 ) cluster galaxies . perhaps because our lfs are constructed purely from spectroscopically - selected cluster members  rather than employing a more uncertain statistical subtraction of non - cluster members  the effect that we see on the derived schechter function parameters is more dramatic .",
    "we have correlated the reflex catalogue of x - ray selected galaxy clusters with the 2df galaxy redshift survey and performed a study of the dependence of cluster galaxy populations upon x - ray luminosity . using this large , homogeneous combined dataset , supplemented with additional rich clusters from the catalogue compiled by @xcite",

    "\\(3 ) both the characteristic magnitude @xmath87 and faint - end slope @xmath10 of the galaxy luminosity function are lower in high-@xmath4 clusters compared to low-@xmath4 clusters .",
    "this is caused primarily by the low value of @xmath11 found for the lf of early spectral type galaxies in the high-@xmath4 sample lf , which is driven by an underabundance of galaxies with @xmath8 relative to the corresponding low-@xmath4 sample lf .",
    "we believe these results are consistent with a scenario in which the high-@xmath4 clusters are more dynamically evolved systems than the low-@xmath4 clusters . the higher fraction of passively evolving galaxies found in the high-@xmath4 sample could arise through the accretion and conversion of a greater number of star - forming field galaxies . the lower value of @xmath11 in the lf of early spectral types galaxies in high-@xmath4 clusters could be explained by ` cannibalism ' of bright ( @xmath8 ) members to produce the very brightest cluster galaxies .",
