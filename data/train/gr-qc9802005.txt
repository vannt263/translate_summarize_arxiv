    "this paper continues the study started in paper i @xcite of how area distances behave in universes where strong gravitational lensing takes place . that paper considered the claim @xcite that although individual lensing masses alter area distances for ray bundles that pass near by them , photon conservation guarantees the same area distance - redshift relation as in exact \u001d  it was shown in @xcite that this claimed compensation result is incorrect once one has passed caustics , which are necessarily the result of strong gravitational lensing ; consequently ( by continuity )",
    "the result is not true in general .",
    "indeed it has to be wrong because area distances are determined by the gravitational field equations ( essentially through the null raychaudhuri equation ) quite independently of the issue of photon conservation ( which is determined by maxwell s equations and is valid whatever the space - time curvature ) .",
    "thus the latter can not causally determine area distances .",
    "in fact at large distances , ` shrinking ' takes place in that distant areas subtend smaller solid angles than they would in a fl universe model ; and this effect will remain even when the observations relate to large angles .",
    "the way these small effects for individual lenses add up to give a significant averaged effect over the whole sky is discussed in paper i. this may affect high - redshift number counts and cosmic background radiation ( ` cbr ' ) anisotropy observations at very small angles .    the general argument has been given in i. specific spherically symmetric examples ( viewed from the centre , and so without caustics ) are presented in @xcite , which thereby gives a rigorous proof of the existence of the effect we claim ; but the models used are unrealistic as models of the real universe . in this paper ( paper ii ) , we consider exact examples with caustics displaying the shrinking effects discussed in paper i. we show how to calculate the magnitude of the effect analytically and numerically for single spherically symmetric compensated lenses to which we can apply the thin - lens approximation , and look in detail at ` top hat ' lenses , which are the simplest in this class .",
    "we refer to and mainly follow the notation of schneider , ehlers and falco ( 1992 ) @xcite ( ` sef ' ) .",
    "we consider compensated spherically symmetric lenses in an einstein - de sitter background universe .",
    "the effect of the lens will be represented by the usual thin lens approximation , and we use the scaled variables of sef .      the angular diameter distances between the observer and lens , observer and source , and lens and source in this background are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively . in an einstein - de sitter model ( @xmath3 , no clumping ) ,",
    "@xmath4 [ see sef ( 4.57 ) ] , and @xmath0 ( respectively , @xmath1 ) is obtainable from @xmath2 by setting @xmath5 ( respectively , @xmath6 )",
    ". \u001d  follows , the dimensionless ratio @xmath7 is important . for a given lens position @xmath8 , as @xmath9 this has the limiting value @xmath10 which has a maximum value of @xmath11 when @xmath12 .",
    "if a source in a flrw universe with scale factor @xmath13 emits a signal at time @xmath14 which is received at time @xmath15 , then the proper distance at time @xmath14 between the source and observer is @xmath16 for an einstein - de sitter universe @xmath17 , the hubble parameter is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , so @xmath20 is this distance in the background universe .      if the energy density is @xmath21 the fractional matter perturbation @xmath22 in an inhomogeneity is related to the matter source by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average energy density over a hypersurface of constant time @xmath25 , defined by @xmath26 integrating ( [ eqn:4 ] ) over @xmath25 , @xmath27d^3x\\ ; ; $ ] so by ( [ eqn:3 ] ) , @xmath28 which is the condition for a compensated perturbation that has been formed by rearrangement of matter in a uniformly distributed background with matter density @xmath24",
    "equivalently , the density @xmath29 averages out to the correct background value @xmath24 ; if this is not true , then the background density has been wrongly assigned @xcite .",
    "clearly this means that @xmath22 \u001d  positive . by ( [ eqn:4 ] )",
    ", no negative densities will occur iff @xmath30    we will assume these conditions to be true for the matter inhomogeneities causing lensing .",
    "then in the lensing equations that follow , the quantities and relations will all refer to the variation from what they would have been in the background model ( i.e. if there had been no lens ) .",
    "thus the lensing ` surface mass density ' @xmath31 will mean the projected surface mass density in the lens plane arising from the density difference @xmath32 from the background value , which will be chosen so that the compensation condition ( [ eqn:5 ] ) is true ; and the ` bending angle ' will be the deviation in direction at the lens from what it would have been in the background model .",
    "this will be given via the usual thin - lens equations , with the surface mass density as just defined .",
    "we define a _ simple compensated lens _ ( ` scl ' ) to be a spherically symmetric compensated lens where @xmath33 is positive for an inner domain @xmath34 , negative for an outer domain @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and zero at larger radii , i.e. for @xmath37",
    ". this configuration would naturally arise by formation of a spherical massive object through gathering together material from an initially uniform substratum . in the sequel we consider a particularly simple form of scl , namely a top hat lens .",
    "given a choice of length scale @xmath38 in the lens plane , there is a corresponding length scale @xmath39 in the source plane .",
    "from the position vector @xmath40 of the source relative to the optic axis in the source plane , and the impact vector @xmath41 in the lens plane , where ( vector ) @xmath42 is the observational angle from the optical axis , we define corresponding scaled variables @xmath43 , @xmath44 by @xmath45 [ sef ( 3.5 ) ] .",
    "the surface mass density @xmath46 for thin spherical lenses can be rescaled as @xmath47 ( sef 5.4 , 5.5 ) .",
    "the lens equation can then be written in the very simple dimensionless form @xmath48 ( sef 5.6 , 8.6 ) where the scaled ( vector ) deflection angle @xmath49 is related to the true ( vector ) deflection angle @xmath50 by @xmath51 ( sef 5.7 ) .",
    "because of the spherical symmetry , the deflection is radially inward and of magnitude @xmath52 given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimensionless mass @xmath55 within a circle of radius @xmath56 ( sef 8.3 ) ; its first derivative is the dimensionless surface density ( sef 8.13 ) : @xmath57 also the change @xmath58 in radial distance traveled by light in a given time , as measured at the source , is equal to the time delay caused by lensing [ sef ( 4.67 ) , ( 5.45 ) ] , and can be rescaled to @xmath59 [ sef ( 5.11 ) and following ] .",
    "this is given by @xmath60 where @xmath49 is given by ( [ eqn:10b ] ) and the ( rescaled ) deflection potential is @xmath61 [ sef ( 8.7)-(8.9 ) ] .      finally , pointwise over the sky , the angular shrinking factor @xmath62 which relates observed distances corresponding to a given angle in the real lumpy universe to those in the background smoothed - out universe ( see paper i ) is @xmath63 which can be averaged over a stated angle @xmath64 to give the average angular shrinking factor @xmath65 over that angle .",
    "similarly the pointwise area shrinking factor @xmath66 which relates observed areas corresponding to a given solid angle in the real lumpy universe to those in the background smoothed - out universe ( see paper i ) is @xmath67 this can be averaged over a solid angle @xmath68 to give the average area shrinking factor @xmath69 over that solid angle .      together the radial and transverse equations ( [ eqn:24b ] ) , ( [ eqn : lens ] ) give the deflection of each null ray relative to the background geometry , and hence the shape of the perturbed light cone in the real lumpy space - time .",
    "these deflections are not independent : they are related by the fact that the speed of light is locally unity , so that the actual light path is stationary w.r.t .",
    "variation of the arrival time delay .",
    "consequently a sideways deflection ( which increases the distance to be traveled ) is compensated by an inwards deflection ( reducing the distance to be traveled ) , so the ( tangential ) lensing equation is a consequence of the ( radial ) time delay equation ( sef pp.146 - 147 , 170 - 171 ) .",
    "it is this combination of radial and tangential effects , implied by the above equations , that gives the light cone caustics their characteristic shapes ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "consider now angles and distances in the perturbed space - time .",
    "we start with angular diameter distance .",
    "consider the source plane of a lens in direction @xmath70 .",
    "image points of nearby directions will be displaced from their background position @xmath71 by the ( scaled ) displacement @xmath72 @xmath73 where the first part is the radial component of the displacement , given by ( [ eqn:24b ] ) , and the second is the tangential component ( in the source plane ) given by ( [ eqn : sc1 ] ) .",
    "if we move our viewing direction through an arc in the sky , the image point will move ; for simplicity we will consider an arc where only one angular component @xmath74 only varies .",
    "this gives a 2-dimensional section of the full 3-dimensional \u001d    as we vary @xmath74 through @xmath75 , the ( scaled ) tangential distance traveled will be @xmath76 , and the radial change of distance @xmath77 will be much less than this .",
    "thus the total _ distance traveled _",
    "@xmath78 due to an angle increase @xmath79 is , to good approximation , @xmath80 where we sum all distances with a positive sign , thus determining the total increment in @xmath81 ( see paper 1 ) . in terms of normalised magnitudes",
    "when spherical lensing takes place , the integrand is just @xmath82 , and _ distance gained _",
    "@xmath83 is the distance moved from the starting point : @xmath84 in this case we subtract off those regions where @xmath85 is negative , ending up simply with the increment of @xmath86 .",
    "now when @xmath87 is positive , distance traveled is the same as distance gained .",
    "however when @xmath88 changes sign , we have cusps forming ( see paper 1 ) and in the formula ( [ eqn:25k ] ) for distance traveled the integral is over the curve corresponding to all values of @xmath89 and hence traverses the cusp backwards and forwards , see figure 1 .",
    "this is different from distance gained ; the latter is then given by the integral ( [ eqn:25k ] ) but where now the integral is over the ( connected ) curve @xmath62 excluding the cusp sections , so that @xmath87 is positive over all the curve traversed .",
    "the _ change in distance gained _ due to the presence of the deflector is small in all cases . the effect for large angular scales",
    "does not average to zero when we have a distribution of lenses , but it is very small ( the change from the background value is given by the difference of @xmath90 at the two ends , corresponding to a minute of arc at most ) .",
    "the _ change in distance traveled _",
    "@xmath91 is given by the integral ( [ eqn:25k ] ) , but now taken over all the closed loops @xmath92 that are excluded when one calculates distance gained .",
    "the effect at each lens is small , but it is cumulative .",
    "hence when there are a large number of lenses , the effect can be large ( as discussed in paper i ) .",
    "we are also interested in the true _ cosmological area distance _ and so \u001d  the question , as we look over a given solid angle , what area does that cover at the source ?",
    "this change is given pointwise by the determinant of the lens equation , see ( [ eqn : det ] ) .",
    "we give explicit expressions for this determinant in the following paragraphs .",
    "a radial increase of size will be partly compensated by a transverse decrease of size , see e.f .",
    "gunn and press @xcite ) , so the area distance will not relate very simply to the ( radial ) angular size distance .",
    "we see then that before caustics form , distance traveled and distance gained are both very similar ( and very close to the background value , on large angular scales ) .",
    "thereafter , they can be very different ( as was argued in paper i ) . to calculate this",
    ", we must locate the cusps and caustics .",
    "_ caustics _ in a source plane are the points in the plane where the jacobean of the lensing map is singular .",
    "_ critical curves _ are the points in the lensing plane where the light rays pass that will end up at caustics at the source plane .",
    "they can be located by determining the zeros of the jacobean of the lensing map .",
    "the set of caustic points in space - time for all source planes form the space - time caustic set .      considering a spherical lens @xmath93 centered at the origin of the cartesian @xmath94-plane",
    ", the jacobian matrix @xmath95 of the ( transverse ) lens mapping in the lens plane has determinant @xmath96 ( sef 8.16 ) which vanishes where either the first or the second brackets on the r.h.s . vanishes .",
    "when the first bracket in ( [ eqn:38 ] ) vanishes , the radius @xmath56 is @xmath97 such that @xmath98 such a critical point occurs for example at @xmath99 ; then there is a tangent vector @xmath100 to the critical curve at this point , and since the curve is tangential , @xmath101 is an eigenvector with zero eigenvalue .",
    "since the tangential critical curves are mapped onto the point @xmath102 in the source plane , there exists a caustic there which degenerates to a single point .",
    "the equation of the tangential critical curve in _ two dimensions _ in the lens plane is then simply @xmath103 , where @xmath97 solves ( [ eqn:39 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to an einstein ring [ many images , in a circle , of one point in the source plane ] .",
    "the determinant @xmath104 in ( [ eqn:38 ] ) also vanishes where the last \u001d  @xmath105 this equation describes radial critical curves .",
    "again it corresponds to a circle in the lens plane .",
    "it has a radial eigenvector @xmath106 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "for instance , at @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "we see in the next section it corresponds to a caustic in the source plane [ and a cusp in the surface of constant distance ] .",
    "the lensing equation ( [ eqn : lens ] ) is a two - dimensional vector equation with ( transverse ) components @xmath109 and @xmath110 while the radial equation gives the 3rd - component for the 2-d section of the past null cone in any surface of constant time .",
    "lensing is radially inward with radial displacement magnitude given by ( [ eqn : sc1 ] ) .",
    "the first term on the right is the position that would have been with no lens ; the second term is the effect of the lens .    to express this in terms of the observational angle @xmath74 from the optical axis",
    ", we note from the relations @xmath41 , @xmath111 that @xmath112 .",
    "hence the magnitude equation takes the form @xmath113 ( sef 4.47b , 5.34 ) .",
    "the cusp angles @xmath114 and @xmath115 are determined by @xmath116 where again by the symmetry , @xmath117 . differentiating ( [ eqn : f2 ] ) , this occurs when @xmath118 that is @xmath119 determines the cusp angle @xmath114 .",
    "these angles correspond to the radial critical points in equation ( [ eqn:42 ] ) . in terms of the bending angle diagram ( figure 2 ) , this occurs where the curves @xmath120 are tangent to the curve @xmath121 .",
    "the cusp physical size is @xmath122 twice this distance is the difference between distance gained and distance traveled , to good approximation . \u001d  @xmath123 and @xmath124 are related by @xmath125 where by the spherical symmetry @xmath126 and the self - intersection of the light cone ( given by the first equality in this equation ) occurs on the central line through the lens ( as implied by the second equality ) .",
    "thus we have from ( [ eqn : f2 ] )    @xmath127    determines the cross - over angle @xmath124 .",
    "thus the cross - over angles @xmath128 and @xmath124 correspond to the critical points satisfying equation ( [ eqn:39 ] ) . in terms of the bending angle diagram ( see figure 2 ) this occurs where the line @xmath129 intersects the curve @xmath121 .    an angle @xmath130 and corresponding impact parameter @xmath131 yields the same image position as the cusp angle , on the other side of the caustic : @xmath132 , and it is _ this _ angle that we treat as the cut - off in the caustic size .",
    "henceforth , we refer to this as the _ cut - off angle _ @xmath130 ( and the cut - off on the other side occurs at @xmath133 ) .",
    "finally , the maximum deflection caused by the lens occurs when @xmath134 , where @xmath135 this does not correspond to either of the other angles ; indeed it lies between them . for a scl centred at @xmath136 , if cusps and cross - overs occur then generically @xmath137    the two - dimensional picture obtained by suppressing one angular coordinate is as shown in figure 1 ( with one radial coordinate and one angular coordinate ) .",
    "going to the full 3-dimensional picture , at the source plane , the whole picture is circularly symmetric about the optical axis at @xmath138",
    ". the cross - over angles at @xmath139 correspond to a circle in the lens plane but a point ( a degenerate caustic ) in the source plane ; the cusp angles @xmath140 correspond to circles in both planes .",
    "we now apply the preceding theory to top hat models .",
    "density @xmath141 for @xmath142 and a constant outer density @xmath143 for @xmath144 with @xmath145 then the compensation condition ( [ eqn:5 ] ) is @xmath146 unless otherwise stated , we will assume that @xmath141 is positive ( so @xmath147 is negative ) .",
    "then the positivity condition ( [ eq : pos ] ) demands that @xmath148 using the scaled variables , and @xmath149 will take the form @xmath150 where @xmath151 , with a central value @xmath152 and a junction value of @xmath153 .",
    "the surface density will positive for @xmath154 , negative for @xmath155 , and zero for @xmath156 , where @xmath157    substituting into ( [ eqn : sc ] ) and integrating ( [ eqn : m ] ) to find the mass function @xmath55 , we obtain the following : @xmath158 where the function @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 the function @xmath159 is a continuous positive even function , with @xmath161 , a single maximum value of @xmath162 at @xmath163 given by @xmath164 , and junction values @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "near zero it has the form @xmath167 it follows that @xmath55 is a continuous non - negative function with @xmath168 and junction values @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "its maximum value is at @xmath171 , where @xmath172 .",
    "consequently , because any scl lens can be built up by a superposition of a sufficient number of top hat lenses , we see that the effective surface deflection mass @xmath173 is always positive and is exactly zero at the outer edge of the compensating region , that is _ the effective 2-dimensional surface density @xmath31 is exactly compensated if the 3-dimensional fractional density @xmath174 is precisely compensated_. hence there is no long - range effect due to the lens : precisely because it is correctly compensated , the deflection angle @xmath175 for impact parameters that lie outside @xmath176 ( where the density takes exactly the background value ) .",
    "thus we note , ( 1 ) for compensated lenses , lensing effects occur only for rays that traverse the lens itself and its compensating region ; ( 2 ) despite the negative values for @xmath31 at some radii in such a compensated lens , the deflection angle is always positive .",
    "collecting formulae resulting from ( [ eqn : sc1],[eqn : m ] ) and ( [ eqn : m1]-[eqn : m4 ] ) , we have that for a spherically symmetric top - hat matter distribution , @xmath177 where the constant is @xmath178 from ( [ eqn:39 ] ) or ( [ eqn : f5 ] ) , cross - overs occur where @xmath179 and from ( [ eqn:42 ] ) or ( [ eqn : f8 ] ) caustics occur where @xmath180 the maximum bending angle @xmath181 occurs where @xmath182 .",
    "consequently ,    \\(1 ) the bending angle @xmath121 is a continuous positive odd function with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , a single maximum value @xmath181 at @xmath185 where @xmath186 , and junction values @xmath187 ,",
    "@xmath188 .",

    "hence cross - overs also occur iff ( [ eqn : crit ] ) is satisfied .",
    "they can occur for any value of @xmath209 up to @xmath210 .",

    "how this scales with @xmath8 ( for given @xmath219 ) depends on how @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath194 and @xmath223 scale with @xmath8 .",

    "we can determine a value for the lensing parameter @xmath231 either by directly estimating the quantities in the definition ( [ eqn : const ] ) , or by estimating the maximum bending angle @xmath181 for lenses considered .",
    "for example , if @xmath232 , the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : bend ] ) has a maximum value of @xmath233 ( when @xmath234 ) . from ( [ eqn : const ] ) with the bending angle relation ( [ eq : bend ] ) and angle scaling relation ( [ eqn:10b ] ) we see that then @xmath231 is determined by the relation @xmath235 \u001d      we have written a series of truebasic programmes that compute all the relevant quantities for tophat lenses , as functions of ( i ) the determining parameter @xmath228 , ( ii ) the source redshift @xmath219 for fixed lens redshift @xmath8 , ( iii ) the lens redshift @xmath8 for fixed source redshift @xmath219 .",

    "however because of the divergence of the light rays within the cusps , it can be much larger for parameter values implying to strong lensing ( the actual angle corresponding to the cusps is then much smaller than in the equivalent fl model ) .",
    "of particular interest is the way the cusp size and the  shrinking \" vary with redshift of the source and of the lensing object .",
    "this depends on two things : firstly the variation of angular sizes with redshift , remembering ( a ) minimum angular apparent diameter occurs at @xmath258 , so that the maximum angle @xmath259 for cusps to form due to lenses of given size and strength will have minimum at that redshift ; and ( b ) that the ratio of distances that enters @xmath260 saturates with increasing @xmath219 ( for given @xmath8 ) but has a maximum for each @xmath219 at a @xmath8 of about @xmath261 which is thus the optimal distance for the lens in order to create cusps on the last scattering surface . \u001d  that are not typical of all galaxies or clusters ; but they confirm in a concrete way the broad picture proposed in paper i : an area ` shrinking ' factor of 3 will occur for each lens that causes cusps , on the scale of the cusps ( precisely : at the cut - off angle @xmath262 which gives the same deflection at the source as the cusp angle , but on the opposite side ) .",
    "the total effect when averaging over large angular scales will depend on what fraction of the sky is covered by these angles for all lenses at all smaller scales , as a function of redshift ; some simple estimates of this overall effect were given in paper i. to determine realistic multiplicity factors as a function of redshift will require simulations with multiple lensing and more realistic lens models , for example standard elliptical lens models determined by a velocity dispersion parameter and ellipticity parameters as in @xcite which allow an increase in the degree of multiple covering ( because individual elliptic lenses can have a covering factor of 5 ) .",
    "the effect will differ on angular scales , and will almost certainly be substantial due to micro - lensing , with an additional increase due to galactic and cluster lensing .",
    "the implication of this paper and paper i is that it is incorrect to assume that areas average out to the background fl value on large angular scales ; one can only know the true area ratios - expressed in the shrinking factors considered in this paper - by detailed calculation .",
