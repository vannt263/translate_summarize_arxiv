    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations by combining data from solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino studies has marked a turning point in our understanding of nature and has brought neutrino physics to the center of attention of the particle , nuclear and astrophysics communities .",
    "this culminates a heroic effort which started over four decades ago and now firmly establishes the existence of small neutrino masses , confirming theoretical expectations which date back to the early eighties .",
    "neutrino mass arise from the dimension - five operator @xmath2 where @xmath3 the 1 higgs doublet and @xmath4 is a lepton doublet  @xcite .",
    "nothing is known from first principles about the mechanism that induces this operator , its associated mass scale or flavour structure .",
    "its most popular realization is the seesaw mechanism which induces small neutrino masses from the exchange of heavy states .",
    "although inspired by unification , the effective model - independent description of the seesaw at low - energies is in terms of the 1 gauge structure and contains a small effective higgs triplet contribution to the neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "such general seesaw has 24 parameters , 3 more than the tripletless case  @xcite  6 charged current seesaw lepton mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "these are exactly the same parameters involved in the description of leptogenesis  @xcite , though in this case the use of the weak basis seems more convenient .",
    "note also that current nomenclature ( type - i versus ii seesaw ) is opposite from the original one in @xcite . ] .",
    "the structure of the three - flavour lepton mixing matrix in various gauge theories of neutrino mass was given in  @xcite and it was also argued that , on _ general _ grounds , massive neutrinos should be majorana particles , leading to neutrinoless double beta decay ( )  @xcite .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data are well described by the simplest unitary lepton mixing matrix neglecting cp violation .",
    "the effect of dirac cp phases in oscillations and majorana phases in constitute the main challenge for the years to come .    here",
    "i focus mainly on the determination of neutrino mass and mixing parameters in neutrino oscillation studies , a currently thriving industry  @xcite , with many new experiments currently underway or planned .",
    "the interpretation of the data requires good calculations of solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes  @xcite , neutrino cross sections and experimental response functions , as well as a careful description of neutrino propagation both in the sun and the earth , including matter effects  @xcite . after summarizing the latest ( post - neutrino-2004 ) global analysis of 3-neutrino oscillation parameters  @xcite  @xcite",
    "i briefly discuss their impact on future searches  @xcite .",
    "this writeup combines my plenary talk and the wg1 parallel session talk on non - standard scenarios of neutrino conversion .",
    "let us first consider neutrino oscillations in the two - flavour approximation  @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino data includes the measured rates of the chlorine experiment at the homestake mine ( @xmath5  snu ) , the most up - to - date results of the gallium experiments sage ( @xmath6  snu ) and gallex / gno ( @xmath7  snu ) , as well as the 1496day super - k data in the form of 44 bins ( 8 energy bins , 6 of which are further divided into 7 zenith angle bins ) .",
    "the sno data include the most recent data from the salt phase in the form of the neutral current ( nc ) , charged current ( cc ) and elastic scattering ( es ) fluxes , as well as the 2002 spectral day / night data ( 17 energy bins for each day and night period ) .",
    "the analysis methods are described in  @xcite and references therein  @xcite .",
    "we use a generalization of the pull approach for the @xmath8 calculation originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in which all systematic uncertainties such as those of the eight solar neutrino fluxes are included by introducing new parameters in the fit and adding a penalty function to the @xmath8 .",
    "the method @xcite is exact to all orders in the pulls and covers the case of correlated statistical errors  @xcite as necessary to treat the sno ",
    "salt experiment .",
    "this is particularly interesting as it allows us to include the standard solar model @xmath9b flux prediction as well as the sno nc measurement on the same footing , without pre - selecting a particular value , as implied by expanding around the predicted value : the fit itself chooses the best compromise between the sno nc data and the ssm prediction .",
    "kamland detects reactor anti - neutrinos at the kamiokande site by the process @xmath10 , where the delayed coincidence of the prompt energy from the positron and a characteristic gamma from the neutron capture allows an efficient reduction of backgrounds .",
    "most of the incident @xmath11 flux comes from nuclear plants at distances of @xmath12 km from the detector , far enough to probe the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the neutrino energy is related to the prompt energy by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the neutron - proton mass difference and @xmath15 is the positron mass . for lower energies",
    "there is a relevant contribution from geo - neutrino events to the signal  @xcite . to avoid large uncertainties associated with the geo - neutrino flux an energy cut at 2.6  mev prompt",
    "energy is applied for the oscillation analysis .",
    "first kamland results were taken from march to october 2002 .",
    "data corresponding to a 162 ton - year exposure gave 54 anti - neutrino events in the final sample , after all cuts , while @xmath16 events are predicted for no oscillations with @xmath17 background events .",
    "the probability that the kamland result is consistent with the no  disappearance hypothesis is less than 0.05% .",
    "this gave the first evidence for the disappearance of neutrinos traveling to a detector from a power reactor and the first terrestrial confirmation of the solar neutrino anomaly .",
    "new kamland data were presented at neutrino 2004  @xcite . with a somewhat larger fiducial volume of the detector",
    "an exposure corresponding to 766.3  ton - year has been obtained between march 2002 and january 2004 ( including a reanalysis of the previous 2002 data ) . in total 258 events",
    "have been observed , versus @xmath18 reactor neutrino events expected in the case of no disappearance and @xmath19 background events .",
    "this leads to a confidence level of 99.995% for @xmath20 disappearance , and the averaged survival probability is @xmath21 .",
    "moreover evidence for spectral distortion consistent with oscillations is obtained  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to treat the latest kamland data binning them equally in @xmath22 , instead of the traditional bins of equal size in @xmath23 .",
    "various systematic errors associated to the neutrino fluxes , backgrounds , reactor fuel composition and individual reactor powers , small matter effects , and improved @xmath11 flux parameterization are included  @xcite .",
    "one finds a beautiful agreement between kamland data and the region implied by the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem , which in this way has been singled out as the only viable one in contrast to the previous `` zoo '' of oscillation solutions  @xcite .",
    "however the stronger evidence for spectral distortion in the recent data leads to improved information on @xmath24 , substantially reducing the allowed region of oscillation parameters . from this point of view kamland",
    "has played a fundamental role in the resolution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "assuming cpt invariance one can directly compare the information obtained from solar neutrino experiments with the kamland reactor results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : solkam - region ] we show the allowed regions from the combined analysis of solar and kamland data .     regions allowed by solar+kamland data at 90% , 95% , 99% , and 3@xmath25 c.l .  for 2 d.o.f ..",

    "the dip in the @xmath27 distribution of the atmospheric @xmath28 survival probability seen in super - k gives a clearer signature for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the analysis summarized below includes the most recent charged - current atmospheric neutrino data from super - k , with the @xmath29-like and @xmath26-like data samples of sub- and multi - gev contained events grouped into 10 zenith - angle bins , with 5 angular bins of stopping muons and 10 through - going bins of up - going muon events .",
    "no information on @xmath30 appearance , multi - ring @xmath26 and neutral - current events is used since an efficient monte - carlo simulation of these data would require more details of the super - k experiment , in particular of the way the neutral - current signal is extracted from the data ( see refs .",

    "the neutrino beam is produced by a 12  gev proton beam from the kek proton synchrotron , and consists of 98% muon neutrinos with a mean energy of 1.3  gev .",
    "the beam is controlled by a near detector 300  m away from the proton target .",
    "information on neutrino oscillations is obtained by the comparing this near detector data with the @xmath28 content of the beam observed by the super - kamiokande detector at a distance of 250  km .",
    "the data k2k - i sample has been collected in the period from june 1999 to july 2001 ( @xmath35 protons on target ) and gave 56 events in super - k , whereas @xmath36 were expected for no oscillations .",
    "the probability that the observed flux is explained by a statistical fluctuation without neutrino oscillations is less than 1%  @xcite .",
    "k2k - ii started in fall 2002 , and released data at the neutrino2004 conference  @xcite corresponding to @xmath37 protons on target , comparable to the k2k - i sample . altogether",
    "k2k - i and k2k - ii give 108 events in super - k , to be compared with @xmath38 expected for no oscillations . out of the 108 events 56",
    "are so - called single - ring muon events .",
    "this data sample contains mainly muon events from the quasi - elastic scattering @xmath39 , and the reconstructed energy is closely related to the true neutrino energy .",
    "the k2k collaboration finds that the observed spectrum is consistent with the one expected for no oscillation only at a probability of 0.11% , whereas the spectrum predicted by the best fit oscillation parameters has a probability of 52%  @xcite .",
    "the re - analysis of k2k data given in @xcite uses the energy spectrum of the 56 single - ring muon events from k2k - i + k2k - ii ( unfortunately not the full k2k data sample of 108 events , for lack of information outside the k2k collaboration ) . under reasonable assumptions",
    ", one can fit the data divided into 15 bins in reconstructed neutrino energy .",
    "one finds that the neutrino mass - squared difference indicated by the @xmath28 disappearance in k2k agrees with atmospheric neutrino results , providing the first confirmation of oscillations with @xmath33 from a man - made neutrino source .",
    "however k2k gives a rather weak constraint on the mixing angle due to low statistics in the current data sample .",
    "the shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : atm+k2k ] are the allowed ( @xmath32 ,  @xmath33 ) regions that follow from the combined analysis of k2k and super - k atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "one sees that , although the determination of @xmath32 is completely dominated by atmospheric data , the k2k data start already to constrain the allowed region of @xmath33 . note also that , despite the downward shift of @xmath33 implied by the new atmospheric fluxes , the new result is statistically compatible both with the previous one in  @xcite and with the value obtained by the super - k @xmath27 analysis  @xcite .",
    "note that the k2k constraint on @xmath33 from below is important for future long - baseline experiments , as such experiments are drastically affected if @xmath33 lies in the lower part of the 3@xmath25 range indicated by the atmospheric data alone .",
    "the effective leptonic mixing matrix in gauge theories of massive neutrinos was systematically studied in  @xcite . for high - scale seesaw models",
    "this matrix is approximately unitary and , for three neutrinos , may be taken as  @xcite   @xmath40 where each factor , for example , @xmath41 contains an angle and a cp phase .",
    "two of the three angles are involved in solar and atmospheric oscillations , so we set @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "all these three phases are physical  @xcite , one corresponds to the one present in the quark sector ( dirac - phase ) and affects neutrino oscillations , while the other two are associated to the majorana nature of neutrinos and show up in neutrinoless double beta decay and other lepton - number violating processes , but not in conventional neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "current neutrino oscillation experiments are insensitive to cp violation , thus all phases will be neglected  ( future neutrino factories aim at probing the effects of the dirac phase  @xcite ) . in this approximation",
    "three - neutrino oscillations depend on the three mixing parameters @xmath44 and on the two mass - squared differences @xmath45 and @xmath46 characterizing solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",

    "note that such a strong rejection of ( 2 + 2 ) schemes holds irrespective of whether lsnd is confirmed or not .",
