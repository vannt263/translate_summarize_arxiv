    "the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is a very active field where new exciting results are appearing regularly .",
    "while a widely accepted formalism exists for studying systems in equilibrium , we are yet to develop a general framework to study irreversible processes . to get better understanding of how systems evolve , it is important to study dynamics of simple physical models .",
    "the ising model is probably the simplest non - trivial model in physics .",
    "studying dynamics of this model may give us some new insights into the general feature of a nonequilibrium process .",
    "even for this simple ising model , studying dynamics is not generally an easy task .",
    "roy j. glauber showed in his classic original work how one can study ( non - conservative ) dynamics in a simple ( ferromagnetic ) ising chain @xcite . since then this work has been extended to study , both analytically and numerically , different systems in numerous physical situations with varying degrees of success . for an arbitrary ising system ,",
    "it is possible to get a non - linear form of the transition rate @xmath0 for which the detailed balance condition is exactly satisfied .",
    "unfortunately , with this non - linear @xmath0 , analytical calculations become intractable .",
    "it has been a real challenge to develop a microscopic kinetic model which will be solvable for a generic system without compromising on the detailed balance condition .",
    "although the numerical studies of the glauber dynamics for different ising systems are substantial and satisfactory , the analytical studies , especially in the two and three dimensions , remain scarce and limited .",
    "there are mainly two types of analytical approaches to study this microscopic kinetic model : the mean field type approaches @xcite and the quantum formalism for the stochastic models @xcite .",
    "the problem of mean field type approaches are obvious ; they undermine fluctuations .",
    "it is though possible to incorporate effects of fluctuations by higher order theories , but they naturally come with more complexities and one effectively needs numerical methods to study them . on the other hand ,",
    "very few system can be exactly solved within the quantum formalism . except for some one dimensional cases ( when problems can be represented by integrable quantum systems )",
    ", one needs to use different numerical techniques or some approximate methods to study dynamics within this approach . in this context ,",
    "purpose of this paper is to present a new analytical approach by which the microscopic dynamics can be studied in _ any _ ising system and which does not undermine fluctuations .",
    "the microscopic kinetic model that we present here is not only exactly solvable in @xmath1-dimension , it can reproduce glauber s exact results for one dimensional ( @xmath1 = 1 ) system . in this sense , our work can be viewed as the generalization of glauber s work for one dimensional ising system .",
    "we will see that , most of the important results regarding the glauber s dynamics in @xmath1-dimensional ising system obtained in different studies can be reproduced by analyzing our model .    to give a brief formal description about the main idea behind our approach",
    ", we note that , while the actual nonlinear glauber model ( nlgm ) is not generally exactly solvable , the detailed balance condition at equilibrium is exactly satisfied by the nonlinear choice of transition rate ( @xmath0 ) . on the contrary , the linear glauber model ( lgm ) , where the choice of @xmath0 is linear , is exactly solvable although the detailed balance condition is not generally exactly satisfied @xcite . for the lgm ,",
    "sometimes called the voter model with noise , @xmath0 is taken in the following form : @xmath2 where @xmath3 in the number of nearest neighbors ( or the coordination number ; @xmath3 = @xmath4 for hypercubic lattice ) and @xmath5 sets the overall timescale of the nonequilibrium process . the variables @xmath6 s are neighboring ising spins of the @xmath7th site .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) determines the strength of noise .",
    "for one dimensional ( ferromagnetic ) ising chain ( @xmath1 = 1 ) , it is possible to find a @xmath8 for which the detailed balance condition is exactly satisfied . for this special case , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is",
    "the inverse temperature and @xmath12 is the strength of coupling constant .",
    "unfortunately for the two and three dimensional systems , no choice of @xmath8 satisfies the detailed balance condition exactly . in this context",
    "we pose the following question : for the @xmath1-dimensional system , _ what is the best value of the parameter @xmath8 of the linear model for which the mean squared error in satisfying the detailed balance condition is least ? _ or in other words , what is the best way of relating the parameter @xmath8 of the lgm to the temperature and the coupling constant such that the results obtained from the model are as close as possible to the results obtained from the nonlinear glauber model ( nlgm ) ?",
    "it is desirable that , the proposed approach to address the issue should give the exact known value of @xmath8 for one dimensional system .    in this paper",
    "we address the stated issue in a more general set - up . for a generic ising system where",
    "a spin is coupled to @xmath3 neighbors with different coupling constants , we show how the nonlinear exact form of the transition rate @xmath0 can be linearized in an optimal way . here obviously , instead of one parameter ( @xmath8 ) , there will be @xmath3 number of parameters in general . in our approach ,",
    "the optimization is done by a linear regression process ; the moore - penrose pseudoinverse matrix involved in the regression process is obtained solely from the configuration matrix and takes a simple form of dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the elements of the pseudoinverse matrix do not depend on the hamiltonian parameters or temperature , this makes our approach very appealing .",
    "for the obvious reason , we call the present microscopic model the _ optimal linear glauber model _ ( olgm ) . here",
    "it may be briefly mentioned that , though the linear glauber model was studied extensively and still attracts substantial interests , to the best of our knowledge , no attempt was made to relate the parameter @xmath8 to the temperature and coupling constant for a generic ising system .",
    "therefore ours is the first work in this direction where we actually show how to do it in an optimal way .",
    "it is easy to extend our approach to study the effect of magnetic field . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that our transition rate in the presence of magnetic field works more efficiently than the commonly used one . as an application",
    ", we show that the inverse of relaxation time changes quadratically with ( weak ) magnetic field .",
    "we also discuss the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the present context .    as an additional advantage of the present work , in the continuum limit we get a linear time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation for non - conservative order parameter dynamics .",
    "this establishes a connection between the phenomenological tdgl theory ( linear version ) and the glauber s microscopic model for non - conservative dynamics .    regarding the nature of the steady state that we obtain from the olgm",
    ", we will later see that ( section 2.5 ) , although the local probability currents are non - zero in the steady state , its average over all possible configurations of the neighbors is zero ; in addition , our approach ensures that the individual opposite currents are on average as small in strength as possible .",
    "these facts allow us to safely say that , within a linearization approach , the steady state that we get here is as close to the equilibrium state as possible .",
    "our paper is organized in the following way . in section 2",
    ", we give a detailed description of our approach . in the next section ( sec 3 )",
    ", we apply our method to study ising systems in different dimensions .",
    "we conclude our work in section 4 .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath14 interacting ising spins ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "these spins can be arranged in any spatial dimension where each spin is assumed to interact with @xmath3 neighbors ( @xmath3 is called coordination number ) . in our approach , nature and strength of the coupling constants can be different .",
    "we here assume that these neighbors are not directly interacting with each other , i.e. , there is no next - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "let us now consider that @xmath16 be the probability that the spins take the values @xmath17 at time @xmath18 .",
    "we note that there can be @xmath19 possibilities of spin configurations , and sum of the probabilities corresponding to all these possibilities is 1 .",
    "we now assume that @xmath20 is the transition rate of @xmath7th spin , i.e. , the probability per unit time that the @xmath7th spin will flip from the state @xmath21 to @xmath22 while the neighboring spins are momentarily remain fixed .",
    "this rate should intuitively depend on the states of neighbors .",
    "we will later discuss in detail the form of @xmath0 s .",
    "following glauber , we can now write the master equation which gives the time derivative of the probability : @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the same spin configuration as @xmath25 with @xmath7th spin flipped .    by considering @xmath26 as stochastic function of time",
    ", we can define two important quantities , namely , a time dependent average spin value @xmath27 and a time dependent correlation function @xmath28 .",
    "these are given below , @xmath29 here sum is over all possible ( @xmath19 in number ) spin configurations , @xmath30 .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath31 .",
    "we now write time derivative of these quantities as first step to obtain them as function of time .",
    "it is easy to get them by multiplying @xmath6 and @xmath32 respectively to the eq .",
    "( [ mstreq ] ) and then sum them over all possible spin configurations . following glauber , these time derivatives can be written as , @xmath33    to solve these equations , a choice of @xmath20 has to be made .",
    "as we may expect , the tendency of the @xmath7th spin to be up or down should depend on the states of the neighboring spins as well on the nature and strength of the coupling constants between @xmath7th spin and the neighboring spins .",
    "for example , if the @xmath7th and @xmath34th spins are coupled by a ferromagnetic interaction , then the @xmath7th spin will try to align itself parallel to the @xmath34th spin .",
    "there can be many ways to choose @xmath20 to obey this tendency , although the option is constrained by the fact that it has to satisfy the equation of detailed balance at equilibrium for all possible configurations of neighbors .",
    "now we will introduce a general mathematical approach by which one will be able to find the optimal linear form of the transition rate for an arbitrary ising system .",
    "when the system reaches equilibrium at temperature @xmath35 , the probability @xmath36 that the @xmath7th spin will be in the state @xmath21 as opposed to @xmath22 ( for a given configuration of neighbors ) , is just proportional to the maxwell - boltzmann factor @xmath37 . here",

    "we ensure that the mean squared error in satisfying the detailed balance condition is least .",
    "the optimization process somewhat compensates the absence of the nonlinear terms in our desired linear form of @xmath0 ( nonlinear terms are typically product of different @xmath55 s ) .    to do a linear regression",
