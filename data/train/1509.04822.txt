    "[ [ section ] ]    the x - ray jet associated with b30727 + 409 was discovered in a relatively short ( 20  ks ) observation from 2014 december 15 ( obsid 17167 ) , targeting the nearby galaxy cluster abell585 ( @xmath28 ; see * ? ? ?",

    "the extended jet is thus remarkably radio faint , with no visible emission in both vla images . to estimate upper limits",
    ", we used the @xmath35-beam images and defined four adjacent @xmath53 apertures elongated along the x - ray jet direction ( position angle @xmath54 ) , centered 3.1 , 5.4 , 7.7 , and 10.0  from the quasar . using the aips task uvsub to subtract the cores from the ( @xmath33 ) data , as well as the modeled gaussian representing the @xmath4 knot in the 1.43 ghz data ( below ) , the @xmath55 point source upper limits in each of the respective apertures were @xmath56 , @xmath56 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57mjy at 1.43ghz , and @xmath58 ( larger due to contamination from the adjacent @xmath59 knot ) , @xmath60 , @xmath57 , and @xmath60mjy at 4.71ghz . assuming the radio jet is composed of a series of four unresolved radio knots within the defined apertures , the total radio emission co - spatial with the x - ray jet visible beyond the @xmath4 knot is thus @xmath61 and @xmath62 mjy , corresponding to @xmath63_x/[\\nu f_{\\nu}]_r>205 $ ] and @xmath64 at 1.43 and 4.71ghz , respectively .",
    "in addition , we detect excess x - ray emission ( a total of 10 counts ) located @xmath3 from the quasar core ( 280 kpc , projected ) , along the same position angle as the jet ( figure [ imgxr ] ) . the hypothesis that this excess of counts is solely due to poisson fluctuations around the average background level estimated from a neighbouring region",
    "is ruled out at the @xmath65-value of @xmath66 ; since it lacks any sdss counterpart , this x - ray feature may therefore likely represent the terminal hotspot of the b30727 + 409 jet .",
    "the corresponding @xmath55 point source upper limits at the location of this x - ray hotspot are @xmath56 mjy ( 1.43 ghz ) and @xmath60 mjy ( 4.71 ghz ) .      by measuring the count rates in four partial annuli with opening angles of @xmath67 and spanning @xmath68 from the quasar core , we estimate that the azimuth corresponding to the radio knot contains @xmath69 x - ray counts above the surface brightness level determined from the other three azimuths .",
    "assuming this emission follows the same power - law index as the extended jet , this implies the knot s flux density at 1  kev is @xmath70 njy , and the 210 kev luminosity of the entire jet ( summing the knot and extended jet ) is @xmath71ergs@xmath24 .    from the vla data , we measured a flux density for the knot of 1.5mjy at 4.86ghz by fitting a circular gaussian component in the ( @xmath33 ) plane with the modelfit program in difmap .",

    "we have corrected for a slight offset between the x - ray and radio contours due to the astrometric error.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "a non - thermal origin provides the most natural explanation for the jet x - ray emission .",
    "we modeled the radio  to  x - ray spectrum of the large - scale jet in b30727 + 409 with the ic / cmb scenario assuming a broken power - law shape of the electron energy distribution , @xmath77 for @xmath78 , and @xmath79 $ ] for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "this parametrization takes into account the expected break in the electron spectrum resulting from radiative cooling .",
    "we also assume pressure equipartition between the emitting electrons and the jet magnetic field , and allow for a heavy jet content with one @xmath82 pair per 110 @xmath83 pairs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we assume a spherical geometry for the @xmath4 knot with a @xmath84kpc radius ( consistent with the knot s radio extent in the vla 4.86ghz image ) , and a cylindrical geometry for the extended jet with the same radius and a length of @xmath85kpc .",
    "knot , along with the corresponding synchrotron plus ic / cmb model curves.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the broad - band jet spectrum can be described by the model shown in figure [ sed ] , returning reasonable parameters : the jet inclination @xmath86 , the jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath87 ( meaning @xmath88 ) , the jet magnetic field decreasing slowly along the outflow from @xmath89@xmath90 g down to @xmath91@xmath90 g , a `` standard '' form of the electron energy distribution with @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and the cooling break decreasing from @xmath95 at the position of the @xmath4 knot down to @xmath96 at the position of the outer jet .",
    "although all parameters are currently only weakly constrained by the data , this model seems to favour a high total jet kinetic power of the order of @xmath97ergs@xmath24 ( depending on the exact proton content ) , and highly relativistic jet bulk velocities maintained over very large scales of order the de - projected source size , @xmath98kpc .",
    "however , the estimated jet kinetic power further depends on various assumptions in our model : for a purely leptonic jet , @xmath99 would be smaller than cited here , while if the magnetic field energy density is below the equipartition value , @xmath99 would increase , while the required relativistic beaming would decrease .",
    "note also that , alternatively , a synchrotron origin of the x - ray emission is not excluded by the data ( however , see the discussion at the end of section [ cosmo ] ) .    on the other hand , a thermal origin of the x - ray emission from the extended jet region is implausible : the best - fit thermal model ( employing the apec model with a metallicity fixed at 0.2 solar ) implies a best - fit temperature of @xmath100kev , which would be unusually high for any truly diffuse structure at @xmath0 . also the corresponding electron density , @xmath101 , and total mass would be exceptional : assuming the same cylindrical geometry as above , the best - fit emission measure of the apec model translates to @xmath102@xmath14 and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 denoting the filling factor of the gas ( with respect to the assumed cylindrical geometry ) .",
    "such large amounts of very hot gas aligned with radio jets have not been observed in luminous quasars , although see @xcite for the @xmath105 radio galaxy pks1138 - 262 .      in the past",
    ", several claims have been made for distinct jet properties of high - redshift quasars when compared with their low - redshift analogs .",
    "for example , @xcite argued for a decrease of the average bulk lorentz factor of high - redshift jets , because of an apparent deficit of luminous sdss radio - loud quasars above @xmath106 with respect to the model predictions based on the swift / bat ( burst alert telescope ) hard x - ray survey .",
    "additionally , @xcite demonstrated that the `` radio - loudness '' ( i.e. , the ratio of the 5ghz core radio flux to the @xmath17-band core flux ) of the sdss@xmath107first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ) quasar population increases with redshift .",
    "b30727 + 409 appears particularly interesting in this context for several reasons .",
    "first , the x - ray luminosity of its large - scale jet is only 56 times lower than the x - ray luminosity of the core .",
    "this is in contrast to the lower - redshift quasars targeted with , for which the jet  to  core x - ray luminosity ratio is typically @xmath108 , or lower ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the active nucleus of b30727 + 409 seems _ under - luminous _ in x - rays with respect to the emission of its large - scale outflow .",
    "second , the unresolved core of b30727 + 409 appears particularly radio - loud for its accretion rate . using the sdss spectrum ,",
    "@xcite estimate the mass of the central black hole to be between @xmath109 ( from the mgii line ) and @xmath110 ( based on the civ line ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the accreting matter estimated from the mgii line is @xmath111ergs@xmath24 , meaning the accretion rate is @xmath112 in eddington units , for the standard @xmath113 radiative efficiency of the accretion disk .",
    "given this rate , b30727 + 409 appears to be characterized by a surprisingly large radio - loudness parameter of @xmath114 , at least 100 times larger than local quasars with comparable @xmath115 ratios ( see * ? ? ?",
    "note that our ic / cmb modeling implies moreover @xmath116 , which is consistent with a very high ( maximum ) efficiency of the jet production in high-@xmath117 sources @xcite .    _",
    "x/[\\nu f_{\\nu}]_r$ ] ratio vs. redshift for x - ray quasar jets detected with ( adapted from * ? ? ?",
    "* with the addition of two subsequently detected @xmath118 examples ) .",
    "b30727 + 409 is shown in red ; the triangle represents the 3@xmath119 lower limit for the part of the jet lacking radio detection .",
    "curves indicate the expected energy flux ratio in the framework of the ic / cmb scenario for given combinations of @xmath120 and @xmath16 ( see equation1 ) .",
    "different knots from the same jet are connected by thin vertical lines.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , in figure [ nufnu ] , we compare the measurements of @xmath63_{x(1\\:kev)}/[\\nu f_{\\nu}]_{r(1.4\\:ghz)}$ ] for b30727 + 409 to those of previously published large - scale x - ray jets detected with .",
    "the x - ray  to  radio luminosity ratios for our target appear consistent with the amplification expected from the ic / cmb model in the case of large jet bulk velocities .",
    "this seems to disfavour a synchrotron origin of the jet x - ray emission in b30727 + 409 . nonetheless , the statistical uncertainties are large due to the relatively short exposure time , and the redshift distribution of jets at @xmath121 is still rather sparsely sampled .",
    "deeper x - ray and radio data will provide significantly improved constraints on the jet emission model for this quasar .",
    "we report on the serendipitous discovery of an extended ( @xmath37 , or @xmath2kpc projected ) x - ray jet associated with the @xmath0 quasar b30727 + 409 , for which the archival vla maps reveal no radio counterpart ( except for a single knot @xmath39 from the quasar core ) .",
    "a possible x - ray hot spot is identified @xmath3 ( 280kpc ) from the quasar .",
    "the remarkable x - ray luminosity of the structure , @xmath122erg@xmath123 , implies a very efficient production of non - thermal x - ray photons by ultrarelativistic jet electrons .",
    "the large x - ray  to  radio luminosity ratio supports the scenario in which this is the inverse - comptonization of the cmb photons which dominates radiative outputs of large - scale jets in the x - ray domain ( at least in  core - dominated quasars  , since in the cases of sources observed at larger jet viewing angles , i.e.  lobe - dominated quasars  and frii radio galaxies , the situation may be more complex ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if correct , this would further imply a highly relativistic bulk velocity ( @xmath124 ) maintained on hundreds - of - kpc scales , even at high redshifts , and a very high efficiency of the jet production ( @xmath125 ) already during the epoch of quasar formation .",
    "the serendipitous discovery of such an object may signal the existence of an entire population of similar systems with bright x - ray and faint radio jets at high redshift , which will have been missed by the current observing strategies that mostly focus on follow - up of known bright radio jets .",
    "similar predictions for the ubiquity of x - ray bright , radio faint _ lobes _ at @xmath126 were put forward by e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
