    "the strong coulomb repulsion pushes the nucleus to large deformation and overcomes the surface tension that tries to keep the nucleus at small deformation . that such systems can exist and have been indeed observed is due to quantal shell effects : according to strutinski s theorem , a less than average density of single - particle levels around the fermi energy gives additional binding , whereas a larger than average value reduces the binding . as a consequence ,",
    "the variation of the single - particle spectrum with deformation creates local pockets and barriers in the deformation energy surface .",
    "being on a scale of about 10  mev , the amplitude of these variations is small compared to the total binding energy of almost 2 gev , but it is large enough to stabilise many heavy nuclei against spontaneous fission .",

    "transactinides_.    over the last four decades , the limits of the chart of nuclei have been pushed far into the realm of superheavy elements up to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one motivation for the experimental efforts in this field of nuclear research is the long - standing prediction of an island of very long - living spherical she , which originally was expected to be centred at @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "even when the expectations about their lifetimes had to be cut down from years or even longer to minutes , perhaps just seconds , finding such nuclei would still provide a unique laboratory to study the nuclear many - body system under extreme conditions .    because of the quickly dropping fusion cross sections @xcite , the number of events for the production of elements with @xmath6 is very low , ranging from just a few to a few dozen .",
    "consequently , the information available for these nuclei is limited to their existence ( where even the attribution of a neutron number is sometimes a matter of debate ) , their dominating decay channel ( usually fission or @xmath1 decay ) and corresponding lifetime , and in case of @xmath1-decay also the @xmath7 value .",
    "for some odd-@xmath8 nuclei the branching of @xmath1-decay into different levels in the daughter nucleus is observed already at this low level of statistics .",

    "it provides detailed information about @xmath12 transitions from @xmath11 isomers , @xmath1-decay transition energies , lifetimes , branching ratios for transitions to different levels in the daughter nuclei , and also information about electromagnetic transitions in the daughter nuclei . as in many cases the daughter nuclei are @xmath1 emitters themselves",
    ", one experiment usually provides data for several nuclei  @xcite .",
    "finally , ion traps can be used to measure ground - state properties .",
    "the latter technique has been added only very recently to the arsenal of heavy - element research .",

    "@xcite and references therein . for heavier nuclei ,",
    "the attribution of quantum numbers has to be based on arguments about selection rules for transitions , which sometimes leads to conflicting spin assignments or even level schemes when the experiments are performed with different set - ups and analysed by different groups .",
    "again , the production cross section limits spectroscopic studies to the most favourable cases of projectile and target combinations .",
    "the experimental efforts are closely accompanied by theoretical studies .",
    "mean - field models are the tools of choice for the description of the structure of transactinides .",
    "they come in two different forms , _ macroscopic - microscopic models _ on the one hand , and _ self - consistent mean - field models _ on the other hand .",
    "macroscopic - microscopic models @xcite combine the `` macroscopic '' energy @xmath15 of a droplet of nuclear matter and a strutinski shell correction @xmath16 that is calculated from the single - particle spectrum obtained from some parametrised single - particle potential .",

    "there are many variants @xcite that differ in the higher - order and deformation - dependent terms of the liquid drop and the form of the single - particle potential .",
    "a calculation consists in scanning the multi - dimensional energy surface for a given family of nuclear shapes for minima .",
    "by contrast , the entirely microscopic self - consistent mean - field models @xcite , used in the form of hf+bcs or hfb , have as solution a set of single - particle wave functions @xmath19 that minimises the binding energy @xmath20 $ ] from a given effective interaction and thereby provides local minima in the energy surface .",
    "still , the surface can be mapped with the help of lagrange multipliers .",
    "there are many variants that differ in the form of the effective interaction .",
    "the most widely used ones are the non - relativistic contact skyrme @xcite and finite - range gogny interactions @xcite as well as relativistic mean - fields ( rmf ) @xcite that are also called covariant density functional theory .",
    "the macroscopic - microscopic method can be obtained as an approximation to self - consistent models  @xcite . in",
    "what follows , the concept of a shell correction will be used for the intuitive interpretation of the results from self - consistent mean - field calculations , even when it is not an ingredient of the model .",
    "both methods have their specific advantages and disadvantages that are often complementary .",
    "the major technical advantages of the microscopic - macroscopic approaches are their numerical simplicity , that the parametrisations of the `` macroscopic '' and `` microscopic '' parts can be optimised separately , and that continuous multi - dimensional energy surfaces for fission or fusion can be easily constructed .",
    "the price to be paid is that this approach can not describe the feedback of the single - particle wave functions onto the mean field , and that the convergence of the results in terms of higher - order shape parameters is difficult to control  @xcite .",
    "there is a multitude of parametrisations of the nuclear surface to be found in the literature @xcite , some of which are better adapted to compact shapes , whereas others are better suited for very elongated shapes and the transition to situations with two centres .",
    "the advantages of the self - consistent models are that due to their variational nature they automatically optimise all shape degrees of freedom not fixed by global symmetries and that they incorporate the feedback of the single - particle wave functions on the mean field .",
    "the latter is not only important for the description of polarisation effects driven by the coulomb field , but also for the description of alignment effects in rotational bands and of the rearrangement of the nucleus when constructing @xmath11 isomers .",
    "extensions of self - consistent models can be used to calculate correlations such as quantum fluctuations in shape degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "in addition , their time - dependent variants can be used for the study of certain aspects of the production of heavy elements  @xcite .",
    "their main disadvantage is that the currently used effective interactions are not yet flexible enough to provide the same level of accuracy for the description of heavy nuclei as the macroscopic - microscopic models , and that the construction of continuous multi - dimensional deformation energy surfaces needed for fission studies with the help of constraints and lagrange multipliers is technically challenging .",
    "the following sections will discuss three aspects of the structure of superheavy nuclei that are important for the extrapolation to the the island of stability based on the available spectroscopic information in the @xmath21 region .",
