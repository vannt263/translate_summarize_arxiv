    "<S> scaling of single photon production in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions is studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is empirically observed the available data scales @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for larger @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo pqcd predictions for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath6 of 200 and 5500 gev , relevant for rhic and lhc energies are seen to closely follow this scaling behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> implications for single photon production in heavy ion collisions are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    radiation of single photons in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions have been studied for a long time , for getting information about the partonic distributions of nucleons and to test the applicability of pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> a similar expectation is also associated with the study of drell - yan process . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> the so - called craigie fit  @xcite to the drell - yan data , showing a scaling @xmath7 has remained a very useful tool for identifying the source of dileptons in hadronic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> scaling relations are also useful in estimating of the strength of ` corrections ' which cause a deviation from the expected behaviour .    owens  @xcite has discussed the possible scaling of the production of single - photons in hadronic collisions . to leading order in @xmath8 , single photons originate from compton ( @xmath9 ) and annihilation ( @xmath10 ) processes , whose cross - sections , @xmath11 , have dimensions of 1/gev@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants are dimensionless and for massless partons no other ( mass ) scale enters into the problem . </S>",
    "<S> this , owens argued , can be used to construct a scaling relationship for the invariant cross - section , @xmath13 , by combining the kinematic variable , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( or the rapidity @xmath17 ) , or equivalently , @xmath14 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , so that one could write @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 a dimensionless function . </S>",
    "<S> this arguments needs to be refined to accommodate the fact that the strong coupling constant @xmath8 depends on the qcd scale parameter @xmath22 which has dimensions of momentum , and the structure functions depend on the @xmath23 at which they are sampled . </S>",
    "<S> this , along with higher order terms , would admit a more complicated dependence on the momentum parameter @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that such scaling violations , depending on the kinematic region could raise @xmath24 to 6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the data for single photon production has been compiled and carefully analyzed using nlo pqcd treatment by vogelsang and whalley@xcite and aurenche et al  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our goal here is much more modest , we analyze them empirically to look for scaling if any . </S>",
    "<S> we see ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) that , indeed , the data show different scaling behaviour for the regions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as is evident from the two lines drawn through them to guide the eye and to indicate the slope ( i.e. the power of @xmath14 ) for a given @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we perform a fit and find that to a very good accuracy , the data show a scaling , such that @xmath27 which varies as @xmath28 and corresponds to @xmath20 , suggesting that the scaling violations are small in this kinematic region ( see fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> numbers varying by a few percent are obtained in an unrestricted fit when the powers of @xmath6 and @xmath14 were used as free parameters .    for the kinematic region @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> we find ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , @xmath30 which varies as @xmath31 and corresponds to @xmath32 in the notation of owens(eq.[owens ] ) . this indicates a large contribution of higher order processes and associated deviation from the simple scaling at smaller @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we digress a little to indicate that even though the e704 data  @xcite at @xmath33 19.4 gev have been included in the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , they were not included in the fitting procedure , which became unstable when this was done . </S>",
    "<S> we also add that in the analysis of vogelsang and whalley  @xcite only these data show a large deviation from the nlo pqcd results obtained there .    </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the e704 data at @xmath33 19.4 gev with the na24@xcite data at @xmath33 23.75 gev further shows that the former has a result which is about 50% larger at @xmath34 3.2 gev which is very curious . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling seen here predicts that for a given @xmath14 , the production at 19.4 gev should be a factor of two smaller , compared to its value at 23.75 gev .    even though it is preposterous to argue about experimental data , it is tempting to note that the data at 19.4 gev are a factor of 3.5 larger than ` expected ' on the basis of this scaling . if it were indeed so , then the nlo pqcd results in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  4 of vogelsang and whalley would provide a perfect description to the ` correct data ' , without any need of inclusion of the so - called intrinsic @xmath35 effects@xcite . the inconsistency of these data as well as the absence of requirement to include intrinsic @xmath35 effects has been discussed in great detail by aurenche et al  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have already noted that the nlo pqcd analysis by vogelsang and whalley and aurenche et al has provided a reasonably accurate description of the data included in the analysis here . thus it would be fair to say that the scaling behaviour observed in the present work </S>",
    "<S> is a fair representation of the nlo pqcd predictions for single photons from @xmath0 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> ( the slight difference between the results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 is neglected here . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the compton term would dominate the contributions for not too large values of @xmath14 . )    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we have plotted the nlo pqcd predictions of @xmath0 scattering at 200 and 5500 gev obtained in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which are relevant for the experiments to be performed at rhic and lhc . for the higher energies </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath14 considered , limits @xmath5 to only smaller values and the scaling eq.([lowxt ] ) provides a very good description to the predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the range of @xmath14 considered at 200 gev is such that it spans both the low @xmath5 as well as the high @xmath5 regions considered in the scalings seen here . </S>",
    "<S> it is gratifying to note that the nlo pqcd resultsi change over from the scaling eq.([lowxt ] ) to that of eq.([highxt ] ) as @xmath5 increases beyond 0.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> what do these results mean for the recently measured single photon data by the wa98 group for the @xmath36 collision at the cern sps ?    </S>",
    "<S> we recall an interesting observation made some time ago by the authors of ref .  @xcite . assuming that such heavy ion collisions lead to the formation of quark - gluon plasma and assuming that the system thus formed undergoes a boost - invariant expansion  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one can relate the particle rapidity density ( @xmath37 ) to the initial time ( @xmath38 ) and the temperature ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the transverse dimension of the system and @xmath42 is decided by the number of degrees in the plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out  @xcite , that the quantity @xmath43 for both @xmath44 and the @xmath36 systems in the wa80  @xcite and the wa98  @xcite experiments at the cern sps , we are offered a unique opportunity of comparing two systems of different volumes which may have identical initial conditions ! </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that if the transverse expansion of the system does not play a significant role then for a given @xmath38 , the only scale in the system is provided by the temperature , for a baryon free plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> if this reasoning is correct then the radiation of single photons per unit transverse area would be identical . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a simple geometrical factor of @xmath45 3.5 by which the data for @xmath44 system can be scaled to get the results for @xmath36 system .    </S>",
    "<S> what about the contribution of prompt photons for the two cases ? </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behaviour of the prompt photons seen here suggests that we may obtain the prompt photon yield for the wa98 experiment as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 17.4 and 20 gev for the wa98 and the wa80 experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the prompt photon production for the wa98 experiment can be obtained by multiplying the corresponding contribution for the wa80 experiment by a numerical factor of @xmath45 3.43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite close to the factor of 3.5 obtained earlier for the thermal photon yield ! in view of the above it is felt that the sum of thermal and prompt photon productions for the two experiments should differ by a factor of about 3.5 !    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 we show the upper limit of the @xmath44 multiplied by this factor against the ( upper limit and ) the data for the @xmath36 system reported by the wa98 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> it is a pity that the weekness of the this signal which is buried into the huge back - ground of decay photons has resulted in the identification of only the upper - limit of the single - photon production for the @xmath44 system . </S>",
    "<S> still , it is interesting to note that the upper limit measured in the wa80 experiment is consistent with the excess of single photon production obtained by the wa98 experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown a recent explanation of the data data  @xcite using ( corrected ) two loop rates for photon production from the qgp along with the contribution of hadronic reactions , as well the prompt photons estimated by wong and wang  @xcite within a pqcd with inclusion of effects of the intrinsic @xmath14 of the partons .    in brief </S>",
    "<S> , we have seen that the data for single photon production in nucleon - nucleon collisions can be broadly divided into two regions @xmath48 0.1 and @xmath49 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> a scaling behaviour @xmath50 is seen for low @xmath5 data , as expected from leading order pqcd , while for larger @xmath5 a behaviour @xmath51 is observed , which indicates large corrections to the lowest order qcd results . </S>",
    "<S> it is hoped that these observations may provide a useful guide - line for identification of source of single photons as well as the extent of corrections over the lowest order pqcd for these processes . </S>"
