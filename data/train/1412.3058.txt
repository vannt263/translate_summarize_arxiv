    "this paper is devoted to the study of the following quasilinear wave equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a _ nonzero _",
    "constant and @xmath8 is a smooth solution . we propose a geometric mechanism for shock formations , i.e. how the smoothness of @xmath9 breaks down .",
    "we remark that if @xmath10 , the equation is linear so that no shock is expected .",
    "we will see that @xmath2 can be regarded as the simplest quasilinear wave equations that can be derived from the least action principle .",
    "the equation can also be regarded as a model equation for the nonlinear version of maxwell equations in nonlinear electromagnetic theory , in which the shocks can be observed experimentally .",
    "the shock formation in nonlinear electromagnetic theory will be the subject of a forthcoming paper by the authors .",
    "the breakdown mechanism is a central object in the theory of quasilinear hyperbolic equations .",
    "we give a brief account on the results related to the current work . in @xcite , alinhac proved a conjecture of hrmander concerning upper bounds of the lifespan for the solutions of @xmath11 on @xmath12 .",
    "this equation was first introduced by f. john ( see the survey paper @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "he @xcite studied the rotationally symmetric cases and obtained upper bounds for the lifespan of the solutions . in @xcite and @xcite , without any symmetry assumptions , alinhac not only shows the solution blows up but also gives a very precise description of the solution near the blow - up point . despite the slight different forms of the equations , alinhac s results are fundamentally different from the current work in the following aspects : ( 1 ) he deals with small data problem .",
    "we will ( and have to ) deal with large data problem .",
    "( 2 ) he uses nash - moser method to recover the loss of derivatives .",
    "based on the variational nature of @xmath2 , we can close the energy estimates with finite many derivatives . ( 3 ) just as alihnac s work , we can give a detailed account on the behaviors of the solutions near blow - up points .",
    "moreover , we show that the singularities formed are indeed shocks .",
    "( 4 ) we can give a pure geometric interpretation of the shock formation ( in terms of certain curvature tensors ) and show that the blow - up behavior indeed can be read off from the initial data directly .    a major breakthrough in understanding the shock formations for the euler equations has been made by d. christodoulou in his monograph @xcite .",
    "he considers the relativistic euler equations for a perfect irrotational fluid with an arbitrary equation of state .",
    "provided certain smallness assumptions on the initial data , he obtained a complete picture of shock formations in _ three _ dimensions .",
    "a similar result for classical euler s equations has also been obtained by christodoulou and s. miao in @xcite .",
    "the approaches are based on differential geometric methods originally introduced by christodoulou and klainerman in their monumental proof @xcite of the nonlinear stability of the minkowski spacetime in general relativity .",
    "most recently , based on similar ideas , g. holzegel , s. klainerman , j. speck and w. wong have obtained remarkable results in understanding the stable mechanism for shock formations for certain types of quasilinear wave equations with small data in three dimensions , see their overview paper @xcite and speck s detailed proof @xcite .",
    "we remark that one of the key ideas in @xcite and @xcite is to explore the variational structure of euler s equations .",
    "this idea also plays a key rle in the current work .",
    "we emphasize that @xcite and @xcite obtained sharp lower and upper bounds for the lifespan of smooth solutions associated to the given data _ without _ any symmetry conditions .",
    "prior to @xcite and @xcite , most of works on shock waves in fluid are limited to the simplified case of with spherical symmetry assumptions , i.e. essentially the one space dimension case . as an example , we mention @xcite of alihnac which studies the singularity formations for the compressible euler equations on @xmath13 with rotational symmetry .",
    "all the aforementioned works have the common feature that the initial data are assumed to be small .",
    "however , since the nonlinearity in @xmath2 is cubic . by the classical result of klainerman @xcite , for small smooth initial data , the solutions of @xmath2 are globally regular . in particular , we do not expect shock formation .",
    "we will use a special family of large data , so called _ short pulse data _ , in the current work .",
    "it was firstly introduced by d. christodoulou in a milestone work @xcite in understanding the formation of black holes in general relativity . by identifying an open set of initial data without any symmetry assumptions ( the short pulse ansatz ! ) , he shows that a trapped surface can form , even in vacuum space - time , from completely dispersed initial configurations and by means of the focusing effect of gravitational waves .",
    "although the data are no longer close to minkowski data , in other words , the data are no longer small , he is still able to prove a long time existence result for these data .",
    "this establishes the first result on the long time dynamics in general relativity and paves the way for many new developments on dynamical problems related to black holes .",
    "shortly after christodoulou s work , klainerman and rodnianski extends and significantly simplifies christodoulou s work , see @xcite . from a pure pde perspective",
    ", the data appeared in the above works are carefully chosen large profiles which can be preserved by the einstein equations along the evolution .",
    "the data in the current work are inspired by these ideas , in particular the idea in @xcite .",
    "the initial profiles are designed in such a way that the shape of the data will be preserved along the evolution of @xmath2 .    as a summary ,",
    "the data used in the paper are motivated by christodoulou s work @xcite and klainerman - rodnianski @xcite on the formation of black holes in general relativity .",
    "the ideas of the proof are motivated by christodoulou s work @xcite and christodoulou - miao @xcite .",
    "we have to overcome all the technical difficulties in the works mentioned above , in particular those in christodoulou s works . at the same time",
    ", we would like to present a clearer geometric picture of the underlying shock formation mechanism .",
    "we rewrite @xmath2 in the so called _ geometric form _ :",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "recall that , if @xmath16 was a constant , @xmath17 would describe the propagation of light in minkowski space and @xmath16 was the speed of light . in the current situation",
    ", we still regard @xmath16 ( which is * not * a constant ) as the speed of light . but",
    "the speed of light depends on the position @xmath18 in spacetime and the solution @xmath9 .",
    "this is of course the quasilinear nature of the equation .",
    "we now briefly review on the basics of shock formations for the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "the idea is to get a heuristic argument for the main equation @xmath2 and to motivate the main theorem .",
    "the inviscid burgers equation can be written as @xmath19 we assume that @xmath20 is a smooth solution . given smooth initial datum @xmath21(non - zero everywhere for simplicity ) , @xmath22 can be solved by the method of characteristics .",
    "a characteristic is a curve in @xmath23 defined by the solution @xmath24 . in the case of burgers equation ,",
    "a characteristic is a straight line and it is determined by the initial datum @xmath21 as follows : it is the unique line passing through @xmath25 with slope @xmath26 .",
    "the method of characteristics says that @xmath24 is constant along each of the characteristics .    to make connections to the geometric form @xmath17 of the main equation @xmath2",
    ", we also propose a _ geometric form _ of the burgers equation ( we assume that @xmath27 to make the following computation legitimate ) : @xmath28 where @xmath29 . then @xmath16 is the speed of the characteristics and it depends on the solution @xmath24 .",
    "we now consider two specific characteristics passing through @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "if we choose datum in such a way that @xmath33 , both the characteristics travel towards the right .",
    "moreover , the characteristic on the left ( noted as @xmath34 ) travels with speed @xmath35 and the characteristic on the right ( noted as @xmath36 ) travels with speed @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath34 travels faster than @xmath36 , @xmath34 will eventually catch up with @xmath36 .",
    "the collision of two characteristics causes the breakdown on the smoothness of the solution . in summary",
    ", we have a geometric perspective on shock formation : a  faster \" characteristic catches up a ",
    "slower \" one so that it causes a collapse of characteristics .",
    "the above discussion can also be read off easily from the following picture :    in reality , in stead of showing that characteristics collapse ( which is on the heuristic level ) , we show that @xmath38 blows up . in stead of being navely a derivative",
    ", @xmath38 have an important _ geometric interpretation_. recall that the level sets of @xmath24 are exactly the characteristics and the @xmath18-plane is foliated by the characteristics ( see the above picture ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 is the _ density of the foliation by the characteristics_. as a consequence , we can regard the shock formation as the following geometric picture : _ the foliation of characteristics becomes infinitely dense_.    we also recall a standard way to prove the blow - up of @xmath38 .",
    "the remarkable feature of this standard proof is that in three dimensions similar phenomenon happens for the main equation @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the generator vectorfield of the characteristics ( for @xmath2 , the corresponding vectorfield are generators of null geodesics on the characteristic hypersurfaces ) .",
    "therefore , by taking @xmath40 derivatives , we obtain @xmath41 this is a riccati equation for @xmath42 and the blow - up theory for @xmath42 is standard . however , we would like to understand the blow - up in another way ( which is intimately tied to the shock formation for @xmath2 ) .",
    "we define the _ inverse density function _",
    "@xmath43 , therefore , along each characteristic curve , @xmath44 satisfies the following equation : @xmath45 i.e. @xmath46 is constant along each characteristic so that it is determined by its initial value .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 will eventually become @xmath47 which implies that the foliation becomes infinitely dense ( for @xmath2 , we will also define an inverse density function @xmath44 for the foliation of characteristic hypersurfaces and show that @xmath48 is almost a constant along each generating geodesic of the characteristic hypersurfaces ) .",
    "we return to the main equation in the geometric form @xmath49 with @xmath15 .",
    "we prescribe initial data @xmath50 on the time slice @xmath51 defined by @xmath52 .",
    "we use @xmath53 to denote the sphere of radius @xmath54 centered at the origin on @xmath51 and use @xmath55 to denote the ball of radius @xmath56 with boundary @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the region enclosed by @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is a small positive number ) is foliated by the @xmath53 s for @xmath60 .",
    "the following picture may help to illustrate the process .       for each leaf @xmath53 in the foliation , there is a unique incoming characteristic hypersurface , which will be defined more precisely in the next section , emanated from @xmath53 . in the picture",
    ", we use a blue surface to denote it .",
    "the incoming characteristic hypersurfaces emanated from @xmath57 and @xmath58 are drawn in black and red respectively .",
    "\\(1 ) data inside @xmath61 .",
    "we take trivial initial data @xmath62 and @xmath63 inside @xmath55 .    in view of the huygens principle , in the backward solid light cone with bottom @xmath55 ( colored in black in the picture ) , the solution @xmath9 is identically zero . in particular , for the incoming characteristic hypersurface , which is the cone in black in the picture emanated from the leaf @xmath64 , since @xmath15 , the incoming speed of this hypersurface , which is noted as @xmath65 , can be computed as @xmath66    \\(2 ) data on the annulus region between @xmath64 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is the region between the black circle and the red circle in the picture .",
    "we require that the size of @xmath67 is approximately @xmath68 on the outermost circle ( which is red in the picture ) @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath69 at @xmath58 .    by taylor expansion , we can compute the speed @xmath70 of the outermost incoming characteristics hypersurface emanated from @xmath58 ( which is red in the picture ) as follows @xmath71    we are now in a situation that resembles the burgers picture . the initial distance between the inner most characteristic hypersurface ( which is black in the picture ) and",
    "the outer most characteristic hypersurface ( which is red in the picture ) is @xmath59 . both hypersurfaces travel towards the center .",
    "the difference of the speeds of two characteristic hypersurfaces is @xmath72 .",
    "we also expect the `` faster''(outer ) characteristic hypersurface catching up the `` slower''(inner ) one .",
    "this catching up process needs approximately @xmath73 amount of time .",
    "we also regard the collision of characteristic hypersurfaces as shock formation , we hope that shocks form around @xmath74 .",
    "we would like to point out a serious gap in the above heuristic argument .",
    "there is one assumption which seems to be very unreasonable : by the choice of the data , we can make sure that the speed @xmath70 of the outer most incoming characteristic hypersurfaces is of size @xmath75 , but there is no clear reason that we should believe the speed @xmath70 remaining the same later on .",
    "therefore , the difference of the two speeds @xmath76 may vary a lot so that the outer most characteristic hypersurface never catch up with the inner one .",
    "the whole point of the paper is to identify a set of initial data so that the profile of the data propagates , i.e. the profile remains almost unchanged . in particular",
    ", we can prove that the speeds of the characteristic hypersurfaces remain almost unchanged for later time . another way to understand",
    "this is through energy estimates : we can find a specific set of data so that we can obtain a priori energy estimates .",
    "once we showed that the energy ( and its higher order analogue ) is almost conserved , we can use sobolev inequality to show that @xmath77 is almost conserved pointwisely along the generators of the incoming characteristic hypersurfaces .",
    "according to the formula of @xmath16 , this also implies the speeds are almost conserved .",
    "finally , we point out that , as in the burgers equation case , instead of showing that characteristic hypersurfaces meet , we show that the inverse density @xmath44 of the foliation by the characteristic hypersurfaces becomes @xmath47 , i.e. the foliation turns to being infinitely dense .",
    "similarly , this can be done by showing that @xmath48 is almost a constant along each generating geodesic of the characteristic hypersurfaces .      with motivations from the previous subsection , we are ready to state the main result of the paper .",
    "let @xmath78 be the time function in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we use @xmath79 to denote the level sets of @xmath78 and it is a copy of @xmath80 for each @xmath78 .",
    "we fix @xmath81 in this paper .",
    "go to @xmath82 and the dependence of the estimates ( of the current work ) on @xmath83 will be crucial . ]",
    "we also use @xmath84 to denote the following @xmath59-thin annulus : @xmath85 where @xmath59 is any given small positive constant .",
    "we recall that the wave speed @xmath16 is defined as @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we first introduce a pair of functions @xmath89\\times \\mathbb{s}^2\\big)$ ] and we will call it the _ seed data_.    the seed data @xmath90 can be freely prescribed and once it is given once forever . in particular , the choice of the seed data is independent of the small parameter @xmath59 .",

    "the cauchy initial data of @xmath2 constructed in the lemma ( satisfying the two properties ) are called no - outgoing - radiation short pulse data    before we state the main theorem , we prove the lemma hence show the existence of no - outgoing - radiation short pulse data .",
    "we recall that @xmath86,@xmath107 and @xmath88 .",
    "we first take an arbitrary choice of @xmath98 and fix this function .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 is given by the formula @xmath108 .",
    "in particular , all the spatial derivatives of @xmath77 and @xmath16 ( determined completely by @xmath77 ) are prescribed on @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , by definition , we have @xmath110 according to the definition of @xmath16 , we have @xmath111 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath112 by virtue of the main equation , we have @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the laplace operator on @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath116 we now use the fact that @xmath117 , where @xmath97 will be determined later on . thus , @xmath118 can be computed as @xmath119    we claim that we can choose @xmath97 , which may depend on the choice of @xmath98 but is independent of @xmath59 , in such a way that @xmath120 .    to see this , we first observe that since @xmath98 is given and @xmath59 is small , we have @xmath121 . indeed , @xmath122 so the bound on @xmath123 is clear . we make the following ansatz for @xmath97 : @xmath124 where the constant @xmath125 may only depend on @xmath98 but not on @xmath59 .    by the ansatz and by looking at the expansions in @xmath68",
    ", one can ignore all the terms equal to or higher than @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , to show @xmath120 , it suffices to consider @xmath127 or equivalently @xmath128 since @xmath129 , by multiplying both sides of the above identity by @xmath130 , it suffices to consider @xmath131 since @xmath132 , we finally have @xmath133 to solve for @xmath97 , for @xmath134 , we consider the following family of ( parametrized by a compact set of parameters @xmath135 and the parameter @xmath59 ) linear ordinary differential equation : @xmath136 since the @xmath96-norms of the solution depends smoothly on the coefficients and the parameter @xmath137 , all @xmath96-norms of @xmath97 are of order @xmath138 and indeed are determined by the solution of @xmath139 in particular , this shows that the ansatz holds if we choose @xmath125 appropriately large in and @xmath59 sufficiently small .",
    "therefore the above construction shows that @xmath140 we claim that , by the above choice of intial data , on @xmath141 , we automatically have @xmath142 indeed , by replacing @xmath143 in the main equation , we obtain @xmath144 by the construction of the data , it is obvious that all the terms on the right hand side are of size @xmath145 . by integrating from @xmath56 to @xmath54 with @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    ", we have @xmath148    the main theorem of the paper is as follows :    for a given constant @xmath149 , we consider @xmath150 let @xmath91 be a pair of seed data and the initial data for the equation is taken to be the no - outgoing - radiation initial data .",
    "if the following condition on @xmath151 holds for at least one @xmath152 \\times \\mathbb{s}^2 $ ] : @xmath153 then there exists a constant @xmath154 which depends only on the seed data @xmath91 , so that for all @xmath155 , shocks form for the corresponding solution @xmath9 before @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath9 will no longer be smooth .",
    "the choice of @xmath98 in the proof of lemma [ lemma constraint ] is arbitrary .",
    "in particular , this is * consistent * with the condition since @xmath98 can be freely prescribed .",
    "* we do _ not _ assume spherical symmetry on the initial data .",
    "therefore , the theorem is in nature a higher dimensional result .",
    "* the proof can be applied to a large family of equations derived through action principles .",
    "we will discuss this point when we consider the lagrangian formulation of . *",
    "the condition is _ only _ needed to create shocks .",
    "it is not necessary at all for the a priori energy estimates .",
    "[ remark smooth break ] the smoothness of @xmath9 breaks down in the following sense :    *  the solution and its first derivative , i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath156 , are always bounded .",
    "moreover , @xmath157 , therefore is always of wave type . *",
    "the second derivative of the solution blows up .",
    "in fact , when one approaches the shocks , @xmath158 blows up",
    ". see remark [ 2nd derivative blow up ] for the proof .",
    "we briefly discuss the derivation of the main equation @xmath2 . the linear wave equation in minkowski spacetime @xmath159",
    "can be derived by a variational principle : we take the lagrangian density @xmath160 to be @xmath161 and take the action functional @xmath162 to be @xmath163 where @xmath164 denotes the volume form of the standard minkowski metric @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equation is exactly the linear wave equation @xmath166 .",
    "we observe that the quadratic nature of the lagrangian density result in the _ linearity _ of the equation .",
    "this simple observation allows one to derive plenty of _ nonlinear _ wave equations by changing the quadratic nature of the lagrangian density .",
    "in particular , we will change the quadratic term in @xmath67 to a quartic term , this will lead to a _ quasi - linear _ wave equation .    in fact , we consider a perturbation of the lagrangian density of linear waves : @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a smooth function defined on @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equation is @xmath171    the function @xmath172 as a perturbation of @xmath173 and therefore we can think of the above equation as a perturbation of the linear wave equation .",
    "for instance , we can work with a real analytic function @xmath172 with @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "in particular , we can perturb @xmath176 in the simplest possible way by adding a quadratic function so that @xmath177 .",
    "in this situation , we obtain precisely the main equation @xmath2 .",
    "it is in this sense that @xmath2 can be regarded as the simplest quasi - linear wave equation derived from action principles .",
    "the main equation @xmath2 is also closely tight to electromagnetic waves in a nonlinear dielectric .",
    "the maxwell equations in a homogeneous insulator derived from a lagrangian @xmath178 which is a function of the electric field @xmath179 and the magnetic field @xmath180 . the corresponding displacements @xmath181 and @xmath182 are defined through @xmath178 by @xmath183 and @xmath184 respectively . in the case of an isotropic dielectric",
    ", @xmath178 is of the form @xmath185 hence @xmath186 .",
    "the fields @xmath179 and @xmath180 are derived from the scalar potential @xmath9 and the vector potential @xmath187 according to @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively .",
    "this is equivalent to the first pair of maxwell equations : @xmath190 the potentials are determined only up to a gauge transformation @xmath191 and @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is an arbitrary smooth function .",
    "the second pair of maxwell equations @xmath194 are the euler - lagrange equations , the first resulting from the variation of @xmath9 and the second resulting from the variation of @xmath187 . fixing the gauge by setting @xmath195 , we obtain a simplified model if we neglect the vector character of @xmath187 replacing it by a scalar function @xmath9 . then the above equations for the fields in terms of the potentials simplify to @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the lagrangian becomes @xmath198 which is exactly .",
    "therefore , the main equation @xmath2 provides a good approximation for shock formation in a natural physical model : the shock formations for nonlinear electromagnetic waves .",
    "we now briefly sketch four main ingredients of the proof .",
    "\\(1 ) the short pulse method . by rewriting @xmath2 in the semilinear form @xmath199",
    ", we notice that the nonlinearity is cubic .",
    "therefore the result in @xcite implies that small smooth initial data lead to global smooth solutions since the classical null condition is satisfied .",
    "we are then forced to consider large initial data . according to the choice of data in the main theorem",
    ", they are supported in the annulus of width @xmath59 and with amplitude @xmath200 which looks like a pulse ( the short pulse data ) .",
    "the energy associated to the data is of size @xmath201 . on the technical level , although the short pulse data is no longer small , we still have a small parameter @xmath59 coming into play .",
    "therefore , most of the techniques for small data problems can also be applied here .",
    "\\(2 ) a lorentzian geometry defined by the solutions . since the lagrangian , therefore @xmath2 itself , is invariant under the time translation and the isometries of @xmath202 , we can linearize the equation via the infinitesimal generators of those actions .",
    "the most important feature about the linearized equations is , they are not just linear , they are linear _ wave _ equations with respect to a special lorentzian metric defined by the solution .",
    "this reflects the lagrangian nature of the equation @xmath2 : the metric comes from the second derivative of the lagrangian .",
    "in particular , the incoming null hypersurfaces with respect to this metric correspond to the characteristic hypersurfaces of the solution . recall that the shock formation is the study of the collapsing of the characteristic hypersurfaces , hence the differential geometry of the metric dictates shock formation .",
    "moreover , we study the energy estimates for the linearized linear wave equations . the energy estimates on one hand depend heavily on the underlying geometry , e.g. the curvature , the fundamental forms of null foliations , the isoperimetric inequalities , etc .",
    "; on the other hand , the energy estimates also control the underlying geometry .",
    "therefore , the study of the linearized equations are more or less equivalent to the study of the underlying geometry .",
    "this leads to a natural bootstrap argument .",
    "\\(3 ) coercivity of angular energy near shocks .",
    "we use the vector field method to study the energy estimates for the linearized equations .",
    "since we expect shock waves , the function @xmath44 , i.e. , the inverse density of the characteristic hypersurfaces , may turn to @xmath47 .",
    "this will pose a fundamental difficulty for energy estimates ( even for linear wave equations ! ) .",
    "roughly speaking , for a free wave @xmath203 , for all possible multiplier vectorfields , in the associated energy or flux integrals , the components for the rotational directions all look like @xmath204 .",
    "but in the error integrals , some @xmath205 components show up _ without _ a @xmath44 factor . in view of the fact that @xmath206 in the shock region ,",
    "the above disparity in @xmath44 shows that one can not control the error integrals by the energy or flux terms .",
    "this difficulty is of course tied to the formation of shocks .",
    "the remarkable thing is , it is also resolved by the formation of shocks .",
    "the idea is as follows : initially , the @xmath207 . if in the future , no shock forms , then the disparity of @xmath44 simply result in an universal constant in the estimates since @xmath44 will be bounded below and above .",
    "if shock forms eventually , then along the incoming direction @xmath44 decreases , i.e. @xmath208 where @xmath106 is the generator of the incoming null geodesics .",
    "although the error integrals contain many terms without factor @xmath44 for @xmath209 , there is one term has a very special form : it looks like @xmath210 .",
    "the sign of @xmath211 in the shock region shows a miraculous coercivity of the energy estimates .",
    "this term is just enough to control all the @xmath205 terms appearing in the error terms .",
    "this is the major difference between the usual energy estimates and the case where shocks form .",
