    "magnetic particles are aligned with an external tilted magnetic field and interacting through an anisotropic dipole - dipole potential@xcite , which depends on the orientation of the external field .",
    "we investigate how the orientation of the field allows to tune the ground state configuration of the system , modulating the competitive interaction between each pair of particles .",

    "[ fig : p01o01_freqs](b ) we show that , by increasing @xmath10 , the two - chain configuration ( phase  @xmath51 ) becomes less stable , since its lowest frequency approaches zero at the point where the four - chain configuration ( phase  @xmath60 ) arises from a continuous lattice deformation of phase  @xmath51 .",

    "[ fig : p01o01_freqs](c ) one can observe that , by increasing @xmath10 , the ground state phase transitions in the highlighted region are a sequence of single - chain and two - chain configurations followed by a group of disorder - like phases and after that four- and three - chain configurations , where all transitions are of first order with the exception of the zigzag transition which has been previously analyzed .",
