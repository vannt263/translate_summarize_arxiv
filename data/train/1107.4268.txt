    "large surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sloan digital sky survey / sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( sdss / segue , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radial velocity experiment ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give the opportunity to a researcher to investigate different topics .",
    "however , one needs to select the appropriate data from these surveys and to classify them according to his / her aim .",
    "rave provides spectroscopic data observed from the southern hemisphere .",
    "radial velocities are available in the first data release ( dr1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectroscopic analyses to provide information on values of stellar parameters ( temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ) are also included in the second data release ( dr2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) additional to the radial velocities",
    ". one can find the stellar parameters in the literature supplemented by stellar position , proper motion and photometric measurements from the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ 2mass _ @xcite and tycho-2 @xcite surveys .",
    "examples of scientific use of such a dataset are described in @xcite .",
    "they include the identification and study of the current structure of the galaxy and of remnants of its formation , recent accretion events , as well as discovery of individual peculiar objects and spectroscopic binary stars .",
    "for example , kinematic information derived from the rave dataset has been used to demonstrate the presence of a dark halo in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified kinematical discontinuities in the direction to the galactic poles which separate a thin disc , thick disc and a hotter component .",
    "@xcite searched for infalling stellar streams onto the local galactic disk and found that it is devoid of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars .",
    "@xcite estimated local standard of rest ( lsr ) values from rave dr3 .",
    "@xcite classified the dwarfs and giants in rave and used this classification in stellar stream detection .",
    "classification of stars in rave as dwarf and giant populations is also the topic of this paper .",
    "however , the procedure we use here is different .",
    "we use the positions of stars in the @xmath1 two magnitude diagram to estimate the number of dwarfs and giants of the sample considered . according to this procedure ,",
    "stars which lie above the line fixed by @xcite are dwarfs and those below the same line are giants .",
    "we show that this procedure provides accurate estimations compared to rave dr2 @xmath0 values .",
    "also , it can be applied without the following considerations of @xcite and hence provides simplicity : _ i _ ) the gravity of a given luminosity class changes with colour , _ ii _ ) reddening of stars causes to a less clear separation of dwarfs from other luminosity classes in @xmath0 distribution , _ iii _ ) the dwarf - giant separation gets better with increasing colour , _ iv _ ) the expected small fraction of dwarfs in combination with their higher @xmath0 uncertainties might hinder a clear separation and _ v _ ) the @xmath0 distribution has been shown to vary with galactic latitude .",
    "our work is the first one in the literature to analyse the effect of chisq in the rave data .",
    "chisq is the penalised @xmath5 from rave s technique of finding an optimal match between the observed spectrum and synthetic spectra to derive stellar parameters .",
    "it is conceivable that sample stars with large chisq and/or small signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) contaminate the dwarf and giant separation with unreliable @xmath0 values .",
    "we investigate whether chisq or s /",
    "n biases rave @xmath0 values and therefore biases the verification of our method of identifying dwarfs and giants via the two magnitude diagram .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the data and field dwarf - giant separation are given in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "confirmation of field dwarf - giant separation and the effects of s / n and @xmath5 on the separation of dwarfs and giants are presented in sections 4 and 5 and finally a summary and discussion is devoted to section 6 .",
    "the data were taken from the rave dr2 @xcite . among 51  829 objects contained in rave dr2 ,",
    "only 49  327 objects are unique , the rest are repeated observations of single stars @xcite .",
    "we prepared our sample by applying the following constraints : _ i _ ) @xmath6 and _ ii _ )",
    "@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the visual apparent magnitude in tycho-2 @xcite .",
    "thus , the total number of our sample was reduced to 11  470 stars , from which we expect more reliable surface gravities and magnitudes . along with @xmath0 values , _ 2mass _ ( @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and tycho-2 ( @xmath11 , @xmath8 ) apparent magnitudes are also available in rave dr2 .",
    "as we need johnson s apparent @xmath12 magnitude , we transformed the magnitudes @xmath11 and @xmath8 to johnson s @xmath12 magnitude by the following equation in the hipparcos catalogue @xcite :    @xmath13    the errors in tycho magnitudes propagate 0.16 mag for @xmath12 magnitude .",
    "@xcite estimates the distances of k0 dwarfs to be between 50 and 250 pc , which encouraged us to neglect extinction for dwarfs .",
    "although k0 giants are located at distances 0.7 - 3 kpc , their galactic latitudes are absolutely larger than 20@xmath14 .",
    "hence , no dereddening was applied to the @xmath12 and @xmath4 apparent magnitudes used in the procedure which separates dwarfs and giants in our work .    to confirm our argument",
    ", we adopted the @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) as the typical colours of fg dwarfs and k giants , respectively and transformed them to @xmath17 magnitudes , i.e. 3.35 and 1.67 via the calibrations of @xcite and the table of @xcite . the combination of these absolute magnitudes with the apparent @xmath4 magnitudes @xmath18 provides distance for a given star .",
    "we estimated @xmath19 distances to the galactic plane for a set of directions defined by the galactic latitudes @xmath20 and galactic longitudes @xmath21 and transformed the corresponding extinctions from @xcite maps to the distance in question by the following equation @xcite :    @xmath22.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the galactic latitude and distance of the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the scaleheight for the interstellar dust which is adopted as 125 pc @xcite and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total absorptions for the model and for the distance to the star , respectively .",
    "@xmath27 can be evaluated by means of eq .",
    "( 3 ) :    @xmath28    @xmath29 is the colour excess for the model taken from the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "then , @xmath30 , i.e. the colour excess for the corresponding star at the distance @xmath24 , can be evaluated by eq .",
    "( 4 ) adopted for distance @xmath24 ,    @xmath31    the numerical ranges for @xmath30 for dwarfs and giants , evaluated by this procedure for @xmath32 , are [ 0.001 , 0.063 ] , [ 0.003 , 0.071 ] , respectively . hence , we can neglect the interstellar extinction in our work .",
    "we adopted the procedure of @xcite to identify the dwarfs and giants in our sample .",
    "@xcite generated an empirical separation line to define dwarf and giant stars in the two selected star fields by their _",
    "2mass _ and @xmath12 magnitudes .",
    "the separation lines were formulated through @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 magnitudes diagrams in these equations : @xmath36 ; @xmath37 ; @xmath38 .",
    "according to this procedure , stars which lie above this line were classified as dwarfs , whereas those lie below this line were classified as giants . in this study , @xmath4 versus @xmath12 magnitude diagrams are used and stars with @xmath39 are expected to be dwarfs whereas those with @xmath40 are expected to be giants .",
    "the procedure was derived from spectroscopic data , hence its confidence level is high .",
    "we approach this problem as explained in the following .",
    "first of all , we plotted the @xmath41-@xmath42 two colour diagram of the sample stars .",
    "1 reveals two subsamples separated by the colour @xmath43 mag , keeping in mind that the dwarf - giant separation is colour dependent .",
    "dwarfs are characterized by larger @xmath0 surface gravities relative to giants .",
    "hence , we combined @xmath0 with @xmath34 colours to proceed in our study .",
    "we adopted @xmath44 as a rough limit for separating dwarfs and giants ( subgiants were not taken into account in the procedure of @xcite , hence we do not consider them in this section , but see the following sections ) .",
    "thus we applied the procedure of @xcite to four subsamples of stars , i.e. i : ( @xmath3 , @xmath45 ) , ii : ( @xmath2 , @xmath45 ) , iii : ( @xmath3 , @xmath46 ) and iv : ( @xmath2 , @xmath46 ) , in order to separate dwarfs and giants in these subsamples ( see table 1 ) .",
    "2 shows that the majority of stars ( 3567 ) in the subsample ii are giants , whereas only 484 stars which correspond to 12% of the total stars in this subsample are dwarfs .",
    "stars in subsample iii consist of dwarfs ( 4357 ) ; only 1% of the total stars in this subsample are giants and the number of dwarfs and giants are almost equal in subsample iv .",
    "in subsample i , the number of dwarfs is 2520 , corresponding to 99% of the total number of stars in this subsample .",
    "this is an unexpected given that subsample i is defined to only include stars with @xmath47 i.e. the @xmath0 values should be too low to be dwarfs .",
    ".comparison of percentages of dwarfs and giants in our rave sample . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as conclusion , stars with @xmath2 can be separated into dwarf and giant populations in a very simple manner , i.e. by their positions in the @xmath34 two magnitude diagram .",
    "one does not need any other constraints for such a separation .",
    "our argument has been confirmed by the work of @xcite and the besanon galaxy model @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of a considerable number of subgiants complicates the separation of stars with @xmath3 into different population types .",
    "the difference between the percentage of subgiants obtained via the @xmath0 versus @xmath34 diagram ( 18% ) and the one estimated by using the besanon galaxy model ( 25% ) supports the values in @xmath0 of rave dataset .",
    "the percentage of evolved ( subgiant and giant ) stars found in this work is consistent with @xcite and in close agreement with @xcite .",
    "for the first time in the literature , we analysed the effect of the chisq in the rave data .",
    "neither the chisq values nor the signal - to - noise ratio bias rave @xmath0 values .",
    "therefore the method of identifying dwarfs and giants via the two magnitude diagram has been verified against an unbiased dataset .",
    "we would like to thank the referee dr . antonio cabrera - lavers for his useful comments that improved the readability of this paper .",
    "funding for rave has been provided by : the australian astronomical observatory , the astrophysical institute potsdam , the australian national university , the australian research council , the french national research agency , the german research foundation , the instituto nazionale di astrofisica at padova , the johns hopkins university , the w.m .",
