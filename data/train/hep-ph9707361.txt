    "the hamiltonian bound - state problem in a field theory is notoriously difficult .",
    "procedures like those of schwinger and dyson or of bethe and salpeter are not easy to cope with in practice as reviewed recently in @xcite . in the fifties ,",
    "the difficulties were considered so enormous that the hamiltonian approach was given up altogether in favor of feynman s action oriented approach .",
    "its modern successors like the lattice gauge theories @xcite have arrived at a stage of making quantitative predictions @xcite . in contrast , phenomenological models @xcite are closer to experiment and have the different objective to classify the bulk of empirical data .",
    "they leave little doubt that a heavy meson contains primarily a pair of constituent quarks and _ not _ an infinity of sea particles as suggested by the perturbative treatment of quantum field theory .",
    "how can one reconcile such models with the need to understand hadronic structure from a covariant theory ?",
    "particularly , how can one reconcile the constituent quark model ( cqm ) with the quantum field theory of chromodynamics ( qcd ) ?",
    "there are several reasons why the front form of hamiltonian dynamics @xcite is one of the very few candidates ( see @xcite ) . particularly the simple vacuum and",
    "the simple boost properties @xcite are in contrast with the complicated vacuum and the complicated boosts in the conventional hamiltonian theory ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays it is known that even the front form vacuum is not simple  @xcite , but it is still simpler than in the instant form : the problem can at least be formulated mathematically @xcite .",
    "the success of discretized light - cone quantization @xcite particularly in 1 + 1 dimensions has stirred hope that its apparent simplicities carry over to 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the two major obstacles for such an endeavor are the following : ( 1 ) the hamiltonian matrix increases exponentially fast with the particle number and the transverse momenta in the fock states .",
    "truncating the fock space to 2 particles like tamm @xcite and dancoff @xcite invokes perturbation theory , violates gauge and lorentz invariance , and generates non - integrable singularities . _",
    "ad hoc _ procedures must be introduced to make things work , both in the original @xcite and the light - cone work @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the unrestricted integration over the transverse momenta creates divergences , which are regularized by some cut - off .",
    "the unphysical dependence on the regularization parameters has to be removed by renormalization .",
    "this is difficult enough in a perturbative context , but serious challenges appear when dealing with the non - perturbative solutions of a hamiltonian ( see @xcite ) .    in the present work ,",
    "these problems are addressed and partially solved by adopting systematically the point of view that the bound states of qcd are eigenstates of the canonical field - theoretical hamiltonian in the light - cone gauge @xmath1 .",
    "the zero modes emphasized in previous work @xcite are omitted here .",
    "in section  [ sec:2 ] a method for diagonalizing numerically a very large matrix , say with dimension @xmath2 , by mapping the problem equivalently to the diagonalization of a reasonably small matrix , say with dimension @xmath3 , is proposed , using the theory of effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the reduction to comparatively small matrices is more than a technical issue and requires one to cope with the many - body aspects of a field theory . in the present work ,",
    "the many - body aspects are kept as resolvents which _ are not expanded as perturbative series_. they are treated in section  [ sec:3 ] by the method of iterated resolvents .",
    "this novel method requires the development of considerable formal apparatus which was given earlier @xcite . in the continuum",
    "limit the matrix equations become integral equations , which are similar to those solved numerically already @xcite , but here they are derived without assuming that the coupling constant is small and without truncating the fock space .",
    "the important issues of vertex regularization and renormalization are discussed in sections  [ sec:4 ] and  [ sec:5 ] lead ultimately to ( linear ) confinement .",
    "the approach is summarized and discussed in section  [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in canonical field theory the four commuting components of the energy - momentum four - vector @xmath4 are constants of the motion . in the front form of hamiltonian dynamics @xcite they",
    "are denoted by @xmath5 , see for example @xcite .",
    "its spatial components @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not depend on the interaction and are diagonal operators in momentum representation .",
    "their eigenvalues are the sums of the single particle momentum components , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 each particle has four - momentum @xmath9 , sits on its mass - shell @xmath10 and therefore has @xmath11 .",
    "each particle state `` @xmath12 '' is then characterized by six quantum numbers @xmath13 .",
    "the first three specify the particle s spatial momentum and @xmath14 its helicity @xmath15 or @xmath16 . for qed that s",
    "all there is , but for qcd a quark is specified further by its color and flavor , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , gluons are specified by the five quantum numbers @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the glue index .",
    "the temporal component @xmath21 depends on the interaction and is a very complicated non - diagonal operator .",
    "it propagates the system in the light - cone time @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 and is the proper front - form hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the contraction of @xmath24 is the operator of invariant mass - squared , _ i.e. _ @xmath25 it is a lorentz scalar and referred to somewhat improperly but conveniently as the ` light - cone hamiltonian @xmath26 ' @xcite , or shortly @xmath27 .",
    "its matrix elements ( and eigenvalues ) somewhat unusually carry the dimension of an invariant - mass - squared . in this work one",
    "aims at a representation in which @xmath28 is diagonal , @xmath29 since the hamiltonian does not conserve particle number , the eigenfunctions @xmath30 are complicated superpositions of particle number projections with contributions like @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) stands thus for an infinite set of coupled integro - differential equations which are even difficult to write down explicitly @xcite .    in order to analyze the structure of the eigenvalue equation",
    ", we apply a technical trick , referred to as discretized light cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite : one imposes periodic boundary conditions on the lagrangian fields . in consequence one maps the infinite set of coupled integral equations onto a _ finite set _ of coupled matrix equations .",

    "since @xmath7 has only positive eigenvalues and since each particle has a lowest possible value of @xmath47 , the number of particles in a fock state is limited for any fixed value of the _ harmonic resolution _",
    "@xmath48 , defined by eq.([eq:2.1 ] ) .",
    "one recognizes this best by way of example .",
    "the lowest possible value @xmath49 allows only one @xmath0-pairs ( a single gluon can not be in a color singlet ) . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the fock space contains in addition pairs of gluons , @xmath0-pairs plus a gluon , and two @xmath0-pairs , as illustrated in table  [ tab:3 ] . for @xmath51 ,",
    "one has at most 8 particles , namely 4 @xmath52-pairs . in the table",
    "all 13 fock - space sectors possible for @xmath53 are enumerated by @xmath54 .",
    "note that the above classification does not change when @xmath55 is increased further : one just adds more complicated fock - space sectors .",
    "their number grows quadratically with @xmath55 and has the value @xmath56 .",
    "the single particle momenta can take all possible values subject to the constraints in eq.([eq:2.1 ] ) .",
    "each of the above fock space sectors contains infinitely many individual fock states , since the transverse momenta can take either sign .",
    "their number can be regulated by some convenient `` fock - space regularization '' : a fock state with @xmath57 particles is included only if the single particle four - momenta satisfy @xcite @xmath58 .",
    "however , it was not realized in the past @xcite , that fock - space regularization is almost irrelevant in the continuum theory .",
    "one needs a better alternative , and we propose to work with `` vertex regularization '' . at each vertex",
    ", a particle with four - momentum @xmath59 is scattered into two particles with respective four - momentum @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "one can _ regulate the interaction _ by a condition on the off - shell mass @xmath62 , @xmath63 in terms of the regulator mass scale @xmath64 .",
    "this innocent step will turn out as a rather efficient tool for analyzing the divergences , see below . to get more insight ,",
    "the relevant momenta are parametrized as @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67p^+,[1-z]\\vec p_{\\!\\perp}-\\vec l_{\\!\\perp},p_2 ^ -)$ ] .",
    "the off - shell mass becomes then simply @xmath68 and the mass scale governs how much the particles can go off their equilibrium values @xmath69 and @xmath70 . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the phase space is reduced to a point , and consequently the interaction is reduced to zero : the hamiltonian matrix ( or the integral equation ) is diagonal , and has the spectrum of the free theory irrespective of the matrix dimension governed by @xmath72 .",
    "once the fock space is defined , one can calculate the matrix elements of the ( light - cone ) hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is written here as a sum of three parts , @xmath73 .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath74 survives the limit of the coupling constant @xmath75 going to zero .",
    "it is diagonal in fock - space representation , its eigenvalue is the _",
    "free invariant mass squared _ of the particular fock state .",
    "the _ vertex interaction _",
    "@xmath76 is the relativistic interaction _ per se_.",
    "it is linear in @xmath77 and changes the particle number by 1 .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath78 which change the particle number by 3 ( as in the instant form ) vanish kinematically : the vacuum _ does not fluctuate _",
    ", see for example @xcite . the _ instantaneous interactions",
    "@xmath79 are consequences of working in the light - cone gauge , are _ gauge artifacts _ , and are proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "they either conserve particle number ( seagull interactions ) , or change it by 2 ( fork interactions ) . for the moment we will drop the instantaneous interaction @xmath81 , but we will restore it later .",
    "most of the hamiltonian matrix elements are then zero .",
    "only those where the particle number is changed by 1 are potentially non - zero , as displayed in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the diagonal blocks are also essentially zero matrices , except for the kinetic energies which reside on the diagonal .",
    "it is a long standing problem of field theory of knowing how such a matrix can have bound states .",
    "the key problem is that the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix increases exponentially .",
    "suppose , the regularization procedure allows 10 discrete momentum states in each direction , _",
    "i.e. _ in the one longitudinal and the two transverse directions of @xmath82 .",
    "a particle has then roughly @xmath83 degrees of freedom .",
    "a fock - space sector with @xmath57 constituent particles has thus @xmath84 different fock states , since they are subject to the constraints , eq.([eq:2.1 ] ) .",
    "sector 13 alone with its 8 particles has the dimension of about @xmath2 fock states .",
    "the hamiltonian method applied to gauge theory therefore faces a formidable matrix diagonalization problem . sooner or later , the matrix dimension exceeds imagination , and other than in 1 + 1 dimensions one has to develop new tools by matter of principle .",
    "one would like to reduce the full problem to an effective interaction between a quark and an antiquark , @xmath85 the derivation of such an effective interaction , is the subject of this work .",
    "effective interactions are a well known tool in many - body physics @xcite . in field",
    "theory the method is known as the tamm - dancoff - approach , since it was applied first to yukawa theory for describing the nucleon - nucleon interaction by tamm @xcite and by dancoff @xcite .",
    "let us review it in short .    in a field theory ,",
    "the fock - space sectors @xmath86 appear in a most natural way , see table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "as explained above , the hamiltonian matrix can be understood as a matrix of block matrices , whose rows and columns are enumerated by @xmath87 in accord with the fock - space sectors like in table  [ tab:3 ] . correspondingly , one can rewrite eq.([eq:2.2 ] ) as a block matrix equation : @xmath88 one recalls that each sector contains many individual fock states with different values of @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the rows and columns of the matrix",
    "can always be split into two parts .",
    "one speaks of the @xmath92-space @xmath93 with @xmath94 , and of the rest , the @xmath95-space @xmath96 .",
    "eq.([eq:319 ] ) can then be rewritten conveniently as a @xmath97 block matrix equation @xmath98 rewrite the second equation as @xmath99 , and observe that the quadratic matrix @xmath100 could be inverted to express the q - space wavefunction @xmath101 in terms of the @xmath92-space wavefunction @xmath102 . but here is the problem : the eigenvalue @xmath103 is unknown at this point .",
    "one therefore solves first an other problem : one introduces _ the starting point energy _ @xmath104",
    "as a redundant parameter at disposal , and _ defines the @xmath105-space resolvent _ or propagator as the inverse of the block matrix @xmath106 , thus @xmath107 inserting this into eq.([eq:321 ] ) defines an effective interaction @xmath108 which by construction acts only in the @xmath109-space @xmath110 the effective interaction is thus well defined : it is the original block matrix @xmath111 plus a part where the system is scattered virtually into the @xmath105-space , propagating there ( @xmath112 ) by impact of the true interaction , and scattered back into the @xmath92-space .",
    "every value of @xmath104 defines a different hamiltonian and a different spectrum . varying @xmath104",
    "one generates a set of _ energy functions _",
    "whenever one finds a solution to the _ fix point equation _",
    "@xmath114 one has found one of the true eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath28 , by construction .",
    "one should emphasize that one can find all eigenvalues of the full hamiltonian @xmath28 , irrespective of how small one chooses the @xmath92-space .",
    "explicit examples for that can be found in @xcite .",
    "it looks as if one has mapped a difficult problem , the diagonalization of a huge matrix onto a simpler problem , the diagonalization of a much smaller matrix .",
    "but this is only true in a restricted sense .",
    "one has to invert a matrix .",
    "the numerical inversion of a matrix takes about the same effort as its diagonalization .",
    "in addition , one has to vary @xmath104 and solve the fix point equation ( [ eq:350 ] ) .",
    "the numerical work is thus larger than the direct diagonalization .",
    "the advantage of working with an effective interaction is of an analytical nature because the resolvents can be approximated systematically .",
    "the two resolvents @xmath115 defined once with and once without the non - diagonal interaction @xmath116 , are identically related by @xmath117 , or by the infinite series of perturbation theory .",
    "the point is , of course , that the kinetic energy @xmath74 is a diagonal operator which can be trivially inverted to get the unperturbed resolvent @xmath118 . in practice @xcite ,",
    "one has never gone beyond the first non - trivial order of perturbation theory for formulating the effective interaction , namely @xmath119 .",
    "this , of course , is highly unsatisfactory .",
    "the identification of the @xmath0-sector with the @xmath109-space and the related effective interaction appears as the most natural thing to do .",
    "but in practice , the tamm - dancoff - approach ( tda ) has two serious defects : ( 1 ) the approach is technically useful only if one truncates the perturbation series to its very first term .",
    "this destroys lorentz and gauge invariance .",
    "( 2 ) if one identifies @xmath104 with the eigenvalue as one should , the effective interaction develops a non - integrable singularity , both in the original instant form @xcite and in the front form @xcite . in order to force the approach to work",
    ", one has to replace the eigenvalue @xmath104 by the kinetic energy in the @xmath109-space @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "in gauge theory the fock space sectors appear in the most natural way , and in dlcq the number of fock - space sectors is finite from the outset as shown in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the block matrix is sparse due to the nature of the underlying hamiltonian , most of the block matrices are zero matrices .",
    "one should make use of that ! the tamm - dancoff approach , particularly the step from eqs.([eq:321 ] ) and ( [ eq:322 ] ) to eq.([eq:345 ] ) , can be interpreted as the reduction of a block matrix dimension from 2 to 1 .",
    "but there is no need for identifying the @xmath109-space with the lowest sector .",
    "nothing prevents us from choosing the last sector as the @xmath95-space : the same steps as above reduce then the block matrix dimension from @xmath121 to @xmath122 .",
    "the effective interaction acts in the now smaller space .",
    "this procedure can be iterated .",
    "the price to pay is that one has to deal with ` resolvents of resolvents ' , or with iterated resolvents .",
    "ultimately , one arrives at block matrix dimension 1 where the procedure stops : the effective interaction in the fock - space sector with only one quark and one antiquark is defined unambiguously . in order to make progress one needs to readjust notation @xcite .",
    "suppose , in the course of this reduction , one has arrived at block matrix dimension @xmath57 , with @xmath123 .",
    "denote the corresponding effective interaction @xmath124 . since one starts from the full hamiltonian in the last sector @xmath121",
    ", one has to convene that @xmath125 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem corresponding to eq.([eq:345 ] ) reads then @xmath126 observe that @xmath127 and @xmath128 refer here to sector numbers . now , in analogy to eq.([eq:332 ] ) , define @xmath129 note that this definition requires only the inversion of the sector hamiltonian @xmath130 , but not of the total hamiltonian .",
    "the effective interaction in the ( @xmath131)-space becomes then @xmath132 this holds for every block matrix element @xmath133 . to get the corresponding eigenvalue equation",
    "one substitutes @xmath57 by @xmath134 everywhere in eq.([eq:406 ] ) .",
    "everything proceeds like in section  [ sec:2 ] , including the fixed point equation @xmath135 .",
    "but one has achieved much more : eq.([eq:414 ] ) is a _ recursion relation _ which holds for all @xmath94 !    [ t ]",
    "the method of iterated resolvents was applied in @xcite to the paradigmatic case of a @xmath136-matrix , including explicit numerical examples .",
    "applying the method to the block matrix structure of qcd , as displayed in table  [ tab:3 ] , is particularly easy and transparent . by definition ,",
    "the last sector contains only the diagonal kinetic energy , thus @xmath137 .",
    "its resolvent is calculated trivially .",
    "then @xmath138 can be constructed unambiguously , followed by @xmath139 , and so on , until one arrives at sector 1 .",

    "the present work has four important ingredients : ( 1 ) the method of iterated resolvents is applied to a gauge theory hamiltonian in the front form ; ( 2 ) in the solution the full quark - pair - gluon propagators can be well approximated by free propagators with the quarks carrying the constituent mass @xmath353 ; ( 3 ) vertex as opposed to fock space regularization is more efficient to regulate all divergences in the light - cone formalism ; ( 4 ) after a renormalization group analysis , the spectrum of the hamiltonian is independent of the two regularization parameters and in the confining regime a new mass scale appears which must by determined by experiment .   after the dust has settled , one seems to get a glimpse of an idea how confinement could work in practice",
    ".    one should emphasize that in this non - perturbative approach there is no fock space truncation .",
    "one calculates lorentz scalars , the eigenvalues of the invariant mass - squared , in a frame independent way .",
    "even the kernel of the interaction @xmath354 is expressed in terms of an invariant , @xmath355 , which is the momentum transfer of the quark .",
    "the present work adopts systematically the point of view that all properties of a lagrangian gauge field theory are contained in the canonical front - form hamiltonian , which is calculated in the light - cone gauge without the zero modes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions allow one to construct explicitly a hamiltonian matrix .",
    "after regularization , one is confronted with the diagonalization of a large but finite matrix .",
    "the binding of the particles in a field theory is provided by the virtual scattering into the higher fock spaces and the tamm - dancoff approach accounts for that , however it accounts for that only in lowest order . for large values of the coupling one",
    "loses control .",
    "these difficulties are overcome in the the present work after re - analyzing the theory of effective interactions . by inverting the hierarchy , it was possible to develop a new formalism , the method of iterated resolvents , and using this method",
    ", one can map the large hamiltonian matrix onto a matrix which is smaller .",
    "finally , the periodic boundary conditions are relaxed by going over to the continuum limit .",
    "having found the eigenfunctions of the effective interaction , one can retrieve all other many - body amplitudes in a self - consistent way .",
    "we saw that the effective interaction has two parts : the flavor conserving interaction @xmath116 and flavor changing interaction @xmath278 .",
    "their diagrammatic representations look like second order diagrams of perturbation theory , but represent a re - summation of perturbative graphs to all orders .",
    "particularly , @xmath116 bears great similarity with a one - gluon - exchange interaction . in analyzing this effective interaction",
    "one uses the apparent self - similarity in a gauge theory .",
    "ultimately , this aspect allows the ` breaking of the hierarchy ' : in the solution , the particles propagate like free particles .",
    "all many - body aspects reside in the vertex coupling functions , in which the well known divergences of field theory appear typically as @xmath356",
    ". this can become large either for large transverse momentum @xmath357or for small longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath89 . in order to remove these divergences",
    ", one needs _",
    "two regulator scales_. regulating the theory on the level of the fundamental interaction , we introduce vertex regularization associated with a mass scale @xmath64 and a small kinematical gluon mass @xmath264 .",
    "insisting that the gauge bosons have vanishing dynamical mass , relates @xmath264 to @xmath64 and removes it from the formalism .",
    "the appearance of a new scale @xmath344 provides the room for an interesting speculation .",
    "one knows empirically that the invariant mass square of the light mesons like the pion is linear in the quark masses . for dimensional reasons one needs a parameter of dimension mass to account for that .",
    "one believes that this parameter is the @xmath0-vacuum condensate @xmath358 , _ i.e. _ @xmath359 .",
    "the vacuum condensate is extremely difficult to calculate and usually is taken from experiment . with the appearance of the additional scale @xmath344 , which can play that role , one can have @xmath360 .",
    "also @xmath344 has to be fitted to experiment , but its role within the theory is well defined .",
