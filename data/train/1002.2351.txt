    "relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( ) collisions are expected to produce a deconfined state of qcd matter  the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  at high enough densities or temperatures .",
    "it has long been suggested  @xcite that the  meson would be sensitive to hot and dense matter ( hdm ) effects , through mechanisms like the dissociation of the  pair due to the colour debye screening .",
    "a significant suppression of the  yield was observed by the phenix experiment in  @xcite and  @xcite collisions at @xmath1 .",
    "however , before giving any interpretation , cold nuclear matter  ( cnm ) effects have to be properly disentangled and subtracted . they are known to impact the  production in proton - nucleus ( ) or deuteron - nucleus ( ) collisions , where the deconfinement conditions can not be reached .",
    "such non - trivial effects are demonstrated by the phenix  data  @xcite obtained at the same energy .",
    "two cnm effects are of particular importance  @xcite : ( i ) the shadowing of the initial parton distributions ( pdfs ) due to the nuclear environment , and ( ii ) the breakup of  pairs consecutive to multiple scatterings with the remnants of the projectile and target nuclei , referred to as the nuclear absorption .",
    "recent theoretical works incorporating qcd corrections or @xmath2-channel cut contributions have emphasized  @xcite that the colour - singlet ( cs ) mediated contributions are sufficient to describe the experimental data for hadroproduction of both charmonium and bottomonium systems without the need of colour - octet ( co ) contributions .",
    "furthermore , recent works  @xcite focusing on production at @xmath3 colliders have posed stringent constraints on the size of co contributions , which are the precise ones supporting a @xmath0 hadroproduction mechanism  @xcite . as a consequence ,  production at low and mid  likely proceeds via a @xmath4 process , such as @xmath5 , instead of a @xmath0 process . as we have shown in previous studies  @xcite",
    ", this modifies both the way to compute the nuclear shadowing and its expected impact on the  production . in this work , we shall focus on the changes induced on the rapidity dependence of the nuclear modification factor in , while using several parametrisations of the nuclear pdf . as in  @xcite  where cnm effects were computed based on a @xmath0 kinematics ",
    "we shall use the same  data to derive the absorption cross - section  required on top of the shadowing , but assuming here a @xmath6  underlying partonic process .",
    "we shall compare the results found in both schemes , with a special emphasis on the limitations from the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : approach ] , we will describe our model and the method chosen to carry a data - driven evaluation of the nuclear absorption cross - section . and in section  [ sec :",
    "results ] , we will present and discuss our results before concluding .",
    "to describe the  production in nucleus collisions , our monte  carlo framework  @xcite is based on the probabilistic glauber model , the nuclear density profiles being defined with the woods - saxon parameterisation for any nucleus @xmath7 and the hulthen wavefunction for the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section at @xmath1 is taken to @xmath8 and the maximum nucleon density to @xmath9 .    in order to study the  production ,",
    "we need to implement in our monte carlo the following ingredients : the partonic process for the  production and the cnm effects .",
    "most studies on the  production in hadronic collisions rely on the assumption that the  pair is produced by the fusion of two gluons carrying some intrinsic transverse momentum  .",
    "the partonic process being a scattering , the sum of the gluon intrinsic transverse momentum is transferred to the  pair , thus to the  since the soft hadronisation process does not alter significantly the kinematics .",
    "this is supported by the picture of the colour evaporation model ( cem ) at lo ( see  @xcite and references therein ) or of the co mechanism at @xmath10  @xcite . in such approaches , the transverse momentum  of the  _ entirely _ comes from the intrinsic transverse momentum of the initial gluons .",
    "however , the average value of  is not expected to go much beyond @xmath11 .",
    "so this process is not sufficient to describe the  spectrum of quarkonia produced in hadron collisions  @xcite . for @xmath12 , most of the transverse momentum should have an extrinsic origin , _ i.e. _  the s  would be balanced by the emission of a recoiling particle in the final state .",
    "the  would then be produced by gluon fusion in a process with emission of a hard final - state gluon .",
    "this emission , which is anyhow mandatory to conserve @xmath13-parity , has a definite influence on the kinematics of the  production . indeed , for a given  momentum ( thus for fixed rapidity  @xmath14 and )",
    ", the processes discussed above , _ i.e. _  @xmath15 and @xmath16 , will proceed on the average from initial gluons with different bjorken-@xmath17 .",
    "therefore , they will be affected by different shadowing corrections . from now on",
    ", we will refer to the former scenario as the _ intrinsic _ scheme , and to the latter as the _ extrinsic _ scheme .",
    "in the intrinsic scheme , we use the fits to the @xmath14 and  spectra measured by phenix  @xcite in  collisions at @xmath18 as inputs of the monte - carlo .",
    "indeed , the measurement of the  momentum completely fixes the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the initial partons : @xmath19 with the transverse mass @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the  mass .    on the other hand , in the extrinsic scheme , information from the data alone ",
    "the @xmath14 and  spectra  is not sufficient to determine @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "actually , the presence of a final - state gluon introduces further degrees of freedom in the kinematics , allowing several @xmath24 for a given set @xmath25 .",
    "the four - momentum conservation explicitely results in a more complex expression of @xmath23 as a function of  @xmath26 : @xmath27 equivalently , a similar expression can be written for @xmath22 as a function of  @xmath28 .",
    "even if the kinematics determines the physical phase space , models are anyhow _ mandatory _ to compute the proper weighting of each kinematically allowed @xmath24 .",
    "this weight is simply the differential cross section at the partonic level times the gluon pdfs , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath29 . in the present implementation of our code",
    ", we are able to use the partonic differential cross section computed from _ any _ theoretical approach . for now , we use the one from  @xcite which takes into account the @xmath2-channel cut contributions  @xcite to the basic cs model and satisfactorily describes the phenix pp data  @xcite down to very low  @xcite .      to obtain the  yield in  and   collisions",
    ", a shadowing - correction factor has to be applied to the  yield obtained from the simple superposition of the equivalent number of  collisions .",
    "this shadowing factor can be expressed in terms of the ratios @xmath30 of the nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdf ) in a nucleon belonging to a nucleus  @xmath31 to the pdf in the free nucleon :    @xmath32    the numerical parameterisation of @xmath33 is given for all parton flavours . here , we restrict our study to gluons since , at high energy , the  is essentially produced through gluon fusion @xcite . in order to see how the cnm effects can vary depending on the different shadowing parametrisations used as an input , we will consider three of them : ndsg  @xcite at lo , eks98  @xcite and eps08  @xcite .",
    "they span the current evaluation of the uncertainty  @xcite on the gluon npdf , from a small to a very large antishadowing .    the second cnm effect that we are going to take into account concerns the nuclear absorption . in the framework of the probabilistic glauber model , this effect is usually parametrised by introducing an effective absorption cross section  of the pre - resonant  pair when propagating in the nuclear medium . in the following",
    ", we shall compare the data - constrained values of  given two different partonic  production mechanisms ",
    "intrinsic and extrinsic  and three shadowing parametrisations as cited above .",
    "we present here the derivation of the  values consistent with the phenix  data , taking into account the various experimental uncertainties and their correlations . to do so",
    ", we have chosen to follow the procedure from  @xcite . for a given choice of the  production mechanism and npdf parametrisation , the best possible agreement of the theory to the data",
    "is obtained for the value of  that minimizes the quantity :    @xmath34    with @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the set of experimental values from phenix , @xmath37  the respective values predicted by the theory for a given set of parameters @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _  the npdf parametrisation and ) , @xmath39 are the point - to - point uncorrelated errors ( statistical and systematic ) , @xmath40 the point - to - point correlated systematic errors , @xmath41 the global systematic error on the normalisation of the data and @xmath42 the fractions of the systematic uncertainties @xmath43 used to shift the data points  @xmath36 .",
    "in the following , we present our results for the  nuclear modification factor in  collisions : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the observed  yield in  ( ) collisions and @xmath46 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions occurring in one  collision . without nuclear effects , @xmath47 should equal unity .    .",
    "extracted from fits of  vs y for the intrinsic ( left ) and extrinsic ( right ) schemes , when considering all the different types of errors on the data , together with the corresponding @xmath48 obtained for the best fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table .",
    "[ tab : sigabs - values ] , we recall the results from  @xcite , with the value of  corresponding to the best fit to phenix data  vs  @xmath14 , and the one standard deviation uncertainties . as in  @xcite",
    ", this extraction relies on the assumption that  is independent of  @xmath14 . the best agreement to the data",
    "is obtained in the extrinsic scheme with eps08 .",
    "the larger is the antishadowing , the larger are the differences between both schemes .",
    "this is visible in the @xmath48 for the best fit or on the different shapes of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdau - vs - y - int - ext ] which shows the obtained cnm effects together with phenix data for  vs  @xmath14 . in this plot , the anti - shadowing peak in   is systematically shifted towards larger  @xmath14 for the extrinsic scheme with respect to the one in the intrinsic case .",
    "this reflects the larger value of the gluon momentum fraction @xmath23 in the au nucleus needed to produce a  when the momentum of the final state gluon is indeed accounted for .",
    "we shall now focus on the bands picturing the cnm effects in both schemes which account for the experimental uncertainties . for the time being , the current size of the errors unfortunately does not allow to distinguish between the two approaches if assuming a constant  with  @xmath14 .    using the same procedure ,",
    "we have qualitatively studied three scenarios with thirty times more statistics and a ) no improvement , b ) a reduction of @xmath49 and c ) a reduction of @xmath50 of the systematics .",
    "we have found that , with the same assumption on  ( namely constant vs  @xmath14 ) , the latest  data ( 2008 ) will not be sufficient to distinguish between a @xmath51 and a @xmath52 production mechanism by _ only _ looking at the @xmath14-dependence of , unless the ( anti)shadowing is as strong as encoded in the eps08 parametrisation .",
    "we are indebted to m.  j.  leitch for helping us to implement the procedure for the @xmath48 minimisation .",
