    "undoubtedly , the heisenberg uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental concepts in quantum theory @xcite . in early development of quantum theory",
    "this played a pivotal role which provided deep insights into the nature of quantum world and the way this differs from the classical world .",
    "the uncertainty principle sets limits on our ability to predict the outcomes of two incompatible measurements , and it was originally formulated by heisenberg  @xcite for position and momentum observables . however , a rigorous proof of the uncertainty relation was presented by robertson  @xcite and schrdinger  @xcite for arbitrary pairs of non - commuting observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 . this is given by @xmath2| \\psi \\rangle|,\\ ] ] where the uncertainties in the observables are quantified in terms of the standard deviations @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the average for an observable @xmath6 in the state @xmath7 . recently ,",
    "stronger uncertainty relations are proved which go beyond the robertson uncertainty relations and they capture the notion of incompatible observables @xcite .",
    "uncertainty relations are at the center stage of current research in quantum theory and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty relations are useful from the point of view of foundational aspects and have applications in quantum technology as well @xcite .    in quantum theory ,",
    "the linear superposition principle gives rise to quantum interference and the uncertainty in physical observables .",
    "the same notion gives rise to the entangled states in composite quantum systems .",
    "there exists both the preparation uncertainty relations as well as the prominent measurement disturbance relations that collectively capture the uncertainty associated with incompatible observables .",
    "measurement disturbance relations have long played an important role in distinguishing the classical world from the quantum world . among the various preparational uncertainty relations and the measurement disturbance relations , note",
    "that the robertson uncertainty relation is not about measurement disturbance , rather it is about preparation uncertainty for a quantum system .",
    "this entails that we can not prepare an ensemble of quantum systems for which two non - commuting observables will have arbitrary uncertainty .",
    "now , one may ask , can the preparation uncertainty be seen in the quantum interference experiment .",
    "can one formulate an uncertainty relation that is directly testable in interference ?",
    "we will show that the uncertainty relation for two arbitrary unitary operators can reveal the preparation uncertainty . in this sense , these uncertainty relations will unify two fundamental features of quantum world , namely , the interference and the uncertainty .",
    "interestingly , massar and spindel have proved an uncertainty relation for two unitary operators that obey the commutation relation @xmath8 which also applies for the discrete fourier transform @xcite .",
    "this tells us the extent to which a quantum state can be simultaneously localized in two mutually unbiased bases that are related by a discrete fourier transform .",
    "in addition , this relation can interpolate between finite dimensional system to continuous variable cases . however , the relation obtained by massar - spindel @xcite is not tight for higher dimensional systems .",
    "a few other results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors have discussed the uncertainty lower bounds for the unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform .",
    "however , there are no uncertainty relation for general unitary operators .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the preparation uncertainty can be captured via the uncertainty relations for unitary operators .",
    "we derive several uncertainty relations for two arbitrary unitary operators which are stronger than those existing in the current literature .",
    "also , we show that our uncertainty relation can be used to derive tight state independent bound for two arbitrary pauli observables and two anticommuting observables in higher dimensions . with regard to the minimum uncertainty states ,",
    "we derive the equation of the critical states for the product of the unitary operators using the _ jackiw analytical method _",
    "we connect this minimum uncertainty state equation equation for two unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform to the problem of finding the ground state of the harper hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we also show that in the infinite - dimensional limit , one recovers the minimum uncertainty state equation of the canonical observables from the minimum uncertainty state equation of the two discrete unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform .",
    "again , we show that the uncertainty relations for the unitary operators reduce to the well known uncertainty relations for the hermitian operators for some set of states and unitary operators .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the uncertainty quantifiers for the unitary operators . here ,",
    "we introduce and discuss the operational significance of the uncertainty relations of unitary operators in terms of state preparation uncertainty and interference visibility . in section iii , we provide uncertainty relations for two general unitary operators . in section iv , we present the unitary operators which obey the generalized clifford algebra and some of their important properties , which will be used in our analysis . in section",
    "v , we briefly discuss the minimum uncertainty states of the unitary operators in general . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the higher dimensional limit of the uncertainty relations and the minimum uncertainty state equation .",
    "we end with discussions and conclusion in section vii .",
    "in the existing literature on the uncertainty relations , various measures of the uncertainty have been proposed .",
    "one such measure of the uncertainty is the variance .",
    "the variance based uncertainty relation for the unitary operators are defined analogously to that of the canonical observables in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be any two arbitrary finite dimensional unitary operators .",
    "the uncertainties associated with @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the state @xmath7 are defined as @xcite @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the uncertainties in any unitary operator has a clear physical meaning .",
    "it is related to the fubini - study metric @xcite on the projective hilbert space @xmath14 of the quantum system .",
    "the fubini - study metric for two quantum states ( say ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 is defined as @xcite @xmath17 if we define @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then the uncertainty in any unitary operator is nothing but the distance between the original and the unitarily evolved quantum state ( up to a constant factor ) .",
    "the uncertainty relation for two non - commuting operators then limits how well we can distinguish two different unitary evolutions of a state from the original state .",
    "it turns out that quantum theory has an intrinsic preparation uncertainty , i.e. , we can not prepare a quantum state for which the sum of two distinguishable metrics will be arbitrarily small .",
    "there is another operational significance of the uncertainty for unitary operators .",
    "the interference fringe visibility can be linked to the uncertainty of the unitary operators . if we send a particle in a pure state @xmath20 through a mach - zhender interferometer and apply a unitary operator in one arm of the interferometer , then the visibility @xmath21 is governed by @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we have the relation @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this shows a strict complementarity between the interference visibility and the uncertainty in the unitary operator .",
    "therefore , any restriction on the uncertainty in the unitary operator will place a restriction on the interference visibility .",
    "the uncertainty relations for two non - commuting operators highlights a preparation uncertainty similar to that of the robertson - schrdinger uncertainty relation .",
    "this says that quantum states can not be prepared which will display maximum visibility in the interference for two non - commuting unitary operators . hence , the amount of visibility for two general unitary operators is non - trivially upper bounded .",
    "various techniques have been developed in the past for analyzing the uncertainty relations of the hermitian operators .",
    "many of them are state - dependent uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "however , they have not been applied in the case of unitary operators yet .",
    "thus , using some of the important techniques explored for the case of uncertainty relation of the hermitian operators , we derive the following uncertainty relations for the general unitary operators . in several occasions , these bound give better bounds than the existing bounds for the variance based uncertainty relations for the unitary operators .",
    "the sum of uncertainties in two unitary operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are lower bounded as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the three - point bargmann invariant @xcite defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath28 .",
    "to prove this , let us define two vectors in hilbert space : @xmath29 from the above definitions , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "now , @xmath32 . using this we get @xmath33 now , we apply the cauchy - schwartz inequality , i.e. , @xmath34 and this leads to : @xmath35 the above equation can be written compactly using the three - point bargmann invariant @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 . with these , we can express eq(7 ) as @xmath39 however , @xmath40 .",
    "this gives the following equation @xmath41 hence the proof .",
    "the above relation can be generalized for mixed states also as given in appendix a using an alternate derivation . recently , uncertainty relation-1 in eq(4 ) is derived using the product representation formula for the weak values @xcite .",
    "unlike the product of the uncertainties , the sum of uncertainties does not face the triviality problem . since the uncertainty relation is a sum of variances ,",
    "the lower bound is not only dependent on the incompatibility of two unitary operators but also on the incompatibility of the unitary operator on the specific states .",
    "if the operators do not share a common eigenstate , there is a non - zero amount of uncertainty shown by the lower bound if the state is eigenstate of one of the operators .",
    "the terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 reveal the incompatibility of the two unitary operators and the incompatibility of the unitary operators on the specific states . to see this , note that if there are no joint eigenstates of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then for the eigenstate of either of @xmath9 or @xmath10 , the above terms reveal a remnant uncertainty in the lower bound . in such cases , the term @xmath42 is equal to one when the condition @xmath44 is satisfied . in other cases ,",
    "if there exists at least one joint eigenstate of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then the uncertainty relation is trivially satisfied with equality .",
    "a weaker version of uncertainty relation-1 can be obtained which reads as @xmath45 this equation is the consequence of the relation @xmath46 . another weaker version of the uncertainty relation can be found which is given by @xmath47 this equation follows from eq(7 ) by eliminating @xmath48 and using the fact that @xmath49 .",
    "it tells that higher is the joint visibility term @xmath42 , lower is the uncertainty bound for the unitary operators .",
    "the term @xmath50 characterizes the phase difference between phases of @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 when the state is either the eigenstate of @xmath9 or @xmath10 or @xmath55 or when @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 , even when the operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are incompatible .",
    "thus it characterizes the difference in phase shifts . to see the dependence of the uncertainty lower",
    "bound on @xmath50 , first note that we can write @xmath58 . using this in eq(8 )",
    "we obtain the following equivalent form @xmath59 it shows that lower is the difference between the phase shifts , smaller is the value of the uncertainty lower bound .",
    "now , we characterize the states that saturate the equality of the above uncertainty relation .",
    "the necessary condition for equality is the cauchy - schwartz equality condition .",
    "the states that satisfy the cauchy - schwartz equality condition have the form @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "a priori it is not evident whether the minimum uncertainty states saturate the cauchy - schwartz equality condition .",
    "therefore , we check this in dimensions @xmath62 for the discrete unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform . from ref.@xcite",
    ", one may note that the minimum uncertainty states of such unitary operators are the ground states of the harper hamiltonian @xcite , which will be discussed in more detail in section v below .",
    "we have taken the ground states of the harper hamiltonian for dimensions @xmath63 , and found that our bound is not saturated for @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear from the table i that though the uncertainty relations are not tight , but they are tighter than that given in ref.@xcite .",
    "later , we prove that the bound given by the uncertainty relation-1 is tight for the unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform in the infinite dimensional limit , i.e. , for the phase space translation operators in infinite - dimensional hilbert space , we show that our bound is saturated asymptotically for the above said class of unitary operators . for an arbitrary state ,",
    "we have plotted our bound in fig[1 ] , which shows that our bound performs better than the massar - spindel bound .                here",
    ", we show that one can obtain the tight state - independent uncertainty relation for two arbitrarty pauli observables @xcite from the uncertainty relation-1 .",
    "let us consider @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be a pair of pauli observables which are both unitary and hermitian , simultaneously . here ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are unit vectors .",
    "then , we have @xmath69 since @xmath9 and @xmath10 are pauli observables , therefore @xmath70 are real vectors .",
    "let , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a real vector . with this , we have the following relation @xmath73 the uncertainty relation-1 for qubits in case of the pauli observables can be expressed as @xmath74 now the last term of the the equation which is state dependent is always positive ,",
    "therefore we have @xmath75 this is nothing but the tight state - independent uncertainty relation for pauli observables . hence the proof .",
    "note that if we want state - dependent uncertainty relation , then eq(15 ) is tighter than eq(16 ) .",
    "the uncertainty relation for the unitary operators can be invoked to obtain the tight state - independent uncertainty relation for the anticommuting observables in higher dimensions of the form @xmath76 for any positive integer @xmath77 .",
    "we can express the anticommuting observables in any @xmath76 dimension as @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite , where @xmath67 and @xmath80 are real vectors in any finite dimensional vector space .",
    "here , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the generators of the clifford algebra . it can be easily deduced that the above mentioned anticommuting observables follow the following state - independent uncertainty relation @xmath83 this uncertainty relation is tight in the sense , that we can always find a quantum state that saturates this bound .",
    "the form of the state is same as before given in @xcite , but only in terms of the @xmath82 as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a pure state and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "this shows that the uncertainty relation-1 has interesting implications for qubits and higher dimensional systems .",

    ", we can obtain one of the above inequality .",
    "again , by starting from the condition @xmath96 $ ] , and following exactly same steps , we obtain , the other inequality in the above equation .",
    "hence the proof .",
    "it is easy to see that the term @xmath97 expresses the incompatibility of the two unitary operators on the states .",
    "this is because , if the two unitary operators do not share a common eigenstate , and unless @xmath98 is an eigenstate of @xmath99 , the eigenstate of either @xmath100 or @xmath101 is not an eigenstate of @xmath102 and thus a remnant uncertainty is shown in the lower bound for such a case . we have plotted this lower bound for the discrete unitary operators related by discrete fourier transform in the dimensions @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a comparison has been made with the other bounds .",
    "the plot show that this bound also performs better than the massar - spindel bound @xcite for certain regions in the state space .",
    "the equality condition is same as the cauchy - schwartz equality condition . to check the bound for the minimum uncertainty states ,",
    "we have shown in table i that this uncertainty relation very closely saturates the minimum uncertainty states .",
    "the uncertainties of two unitary operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are lower bounded as @xmath105 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proof of this follows from the parallelogram law of the hilbert space vectors .",
    "we take @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "then applying the parallelogram law of vectors , i.e. , @xmath106 we find , @xmath107 .",
    "it is easily checked that the term @xmath108 is positive .",
    "therefore , for such a case , we have @xmath109 . to obtain eq(20 )",
    ", we generalize vaidman s formula @xcite @xmath110 @xcite for non - hermitian operator .",
    "it can be chekced that for any non - hermitian operator a , we have @xmath111 , where @xmath112 . if we let @xmath113 , then @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we get the above bound .",
    "the second inequality follows similarly . in this case also , it is clear that the r.h.s .",
    "is indeed a measure of incompatibility of @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the state , since it expresses the fact that if the incompatible unitary operators do not have a common eigenstate , the r.h.s .",
    "always gives a non - zero value showing a finite amount of uncertainty , except for the trivial case when @xmath98 is an eigenstate of @xmath115 .",
    "the equality condition is again given the cauchy - schwartz equality condition .",

    "@xcite for the case of the hermitian operators . here",
    ", one finds the stationary points of the uncertainty functional using lagrange s multiplier method .",
    "apart from this method , in the case of two unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform [ see eq .",
    "( b2 ) in appendix b ] , the minimum uncertainty states have been found to be the ground states of a hermitian operator called the harper hamiltonian @xcite , which is of the form @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is a real parameter and @xmath119 , @xmath120 are hermitian operators constructed from the operators @xmath121 and @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "the ground states of these hamiltonian are the discrete generalizations of the coherent states and squeezed states in the infinite - dimensional hilbert space . in the infinite - dimensional limit",
    ", the harper hamiltonian reduces to the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian while the discrete coherent and squeezed states reduce to the coherent and squeezed states in the continuum case of canonical observables @xcite .      here",
    ", we show that it is enough to consider pure states as the states that minimize the uncertainty sum as well as the product of the variances . at first",
    ", we take the pure state that minimizes the uncertainty functional to be @xmath123 . next , let us take a density matrix @xmath124 , where , not all of them are the pure states that minimize the product of the variances or the sum of the variances . then , we have that @xmath125 .",
    "this inequality follows from the concavity of variance in state for the unitary operators , which can be proved easily .",
    "thus , we have @xmath126 .",
    "but , we know that for the case of the pure states , we have the following equation @xmath127 thus , from the above equation it is easily seen that for the sum of the variances , among all the states in the state space , only the pure states suffice to desribe all the states that minimize the sum of the variances .",
    "now , let us check this for the product of the variances @xmath128 .",
    "for the product of the variances , we know that @xmath129 . hence , we see that for the minimum uncertainty states , the following holds @xmath130 here , @xmath131 refers to the remaining cross terms . since @xmath132 and @xmath133 are all positive , therefore @xmath131 is itself a positive quantity .",
    "now , by definition , @xmath134 . as a result",
    ", we can replace all @xmath135 by @xmath136 in @xmath137 to get the minimum value of the product of the uncertainties .",

    "the minimum uncertainty states were found out for the product of variances of the unitary operators , and lower bounds were found for the uncertainty relation using these states under the constraint @xmath139 . here",
    ", we show that how by using the analytic method of finding the minimum uncertainty states , we recover them as the eigenstates of the harper hamiltonian , for the cases of the discrete unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform . the analytic method as employed by jackiw @xcite for hermitian operators uses the method of lagrange s multipliers .",
    "therefore , applying the same method of lagrange s multiplier to find the stationary points for the uncertainty functional of the unitary operators , i.e. , the product of the variances of the unitary operators subject to the constraint @xmath140 , we get the following equation @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the undetermined multiplier and the variation of @xmath143 is independent of @xmath144 . from the above equation , we easily get that the stationary state equation for the product of the variances of the @xmath77 unitary operators subject to the normalization constraint as the following @xmath145\\vert\\psi\\rangle=\\vert\\psi\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call all the states that satisfy the above equation as _",

    "in other words , the ground states of the operator @xmath177 will be the minimum uncertainty states .",
    "this operator looks similar to the harper hamiltonian , however a translated version of the harper hamiltonian per say .",
    "it is easy to note that if we can find states such that both @xmath178 and @xmath179 are real simultaneously keeping @xmath174 invariant , then the minimum uncertainty states will be given by the ground states of the harper hamiltonian @xmath180 .",
    "now we illustrate this with the unitary operators obeying the the discrete version of the generalized clifford algebra at first .",
    "it has been proved that for the discrete unitary operators related by the discrete fourier transform , maximum of the @xmath181 and @xmath179 occurs when @xmath182 @xcite and @xmath183 @xcite , where @xmath184 and subsequently with the help of the translation operator @xmath185 we can have states for which both @xmath178 and @xmath179 are real , keeping the uncertainty product intact .",
