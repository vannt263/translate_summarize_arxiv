    "the irradiation from the parent star is , by far , the most important source of energy in planetary atmospheres .",
    "most of the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere of a planet are largely driven by the stellar input , which ultimately determines its structure , composition and , even , its mere existence .",
    "most of the radiation emitted by the sun comes from the photosphere and , at the solar effective temperature today ( @xmath8 k ) , it is the dominant source at wavelengths above 170 nm .",
    "the solar photospheric flux is quite stable over short timescales ( decades ) and it only suffers variations driven by sunspots and faculae with an amplitude below 0.20.3% peak to peak @xcite . over long timescales , the variations have been larger and are related to the nuclear evolution of the sun .",
    "model predictions indicate that the young zams sun could have had a luminosity some 35% lower than today ( unless a scenario of heavy mass loss is considered ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energetic end of the solar spectrum ( i.e. , below 170 nm ) is dominated by the emissions from high - temperature plasma in the chromosphere , transition region and corona .",
    "such high - energy fluxes are strongly variable over short- and mid - term timescales because of flare events , rotational modulation , activity cycles , etc .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . over longer timescales",
    ", several past studies @xcite established that the young sun s high - energy emissions were possibly up to several orders of magnitude stronger than currently .",
    "the sun in time programme ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) focused on a small sample of carefully - selected and well - studied stellar proxies that represent key stages in the evolution of the sun .",
    "this approach allowed the study in the x - ray , euv , and fuv domains , where the variations are of one order of magnitude or more .",
    "however , the stellar proxy technique becomes increasingly uncertain in the uv since the stars are not perfect matches to the sun ( their masses are within 10% of 1  m@xmath7 ) and the expected flux variations are in the range of tens of a percent .",
    "for this reason , most of the sun in time stars employed in paper i can not be reliably used to infer the solar flux evolution at wavelengths longer than about 130 nm .",
    "but at the same time , the wavelength interval between 130 and 200 nm is an essential energy input to planetary atmospheres since it drives most of the photochemical reactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the coud spectrograph of the 1.60-m telescope of observatrio do pico dos dias ( opd , braspolis , brazil ) , operated by laboratrio nacional de astrofsica ( lna / cnpq ) , was used to obtain spectra of @xmath0  cet  and the sun ( represented by moon spectra ) in a 150  spectral range , centered in the h@xmath1 line , with r = 20000 and s / n ratios in excess of 300 .",
    "@xmath0  cet  was observed in 2008 , and the moon spectra were acquired in a series of runs between 1994 and 2004 , to ensure the absence of long - term systematics .",

    "the measured @xmath12s  were corrected by + 3.6% to bring them onto a system compatible with the voigt - fitted solar @xmath12s  of @xcite .",
    "the reason for the correction is both a low level of scattered light in the spectrograph ( @xmath15  2% ) and also the inability of gaussian fits to fully represent observed line profiles .",

    "when one considers the results of recent spectroscopic analyses of @xmath0  cet , all of them based on high - quality , high - resolution spectra ( table  [ tab : param ] ) , an interesting pattern emerges .",

    "authors do not generally agree whether this offset is due to nlte effects in cool stars , in the sense that for stars with @xmath2  @xmath6 5000 k the offsets are large , while for @xmath2  @xmath6 6000 k good agreement is found @xcite : this discrepancy is revealed in this case either by a disagreement between chemical abundances derived from different lines of the same species ( atomic or molecular ) or by the non - realization of the / ionization equilibrium .",
    "another interpretation is the presence of high chromospheric activity , an enhanced non - local uv radiation field and a resulting photospheric overionization @xcite . in a classical spectroscopic analysis , forcing agreement between and abundances under lte , but in the presence of an overionizing radiation field , leads naturally to a higher @xmath2 .",

    "this gives rise to a significantly enhanced magnetic dynamo and consequently stronger magnetically - generated phenomena .",

    "the appearance of the core flux spectra does not translate directly to the chromospheric fluxes , since the core flux is integrated in a 1.7   - wide window and @xmath2   differences among the group members are not negligible . considering the dispersions of the mean h@xmath1 core fluxes of the hyades cluster and the uma group , nearly the same mean h@xmath1 activity level can be ascribed to them , and @xmath0  cet  is therefore compatible with their age range .",

    "is seen to have one of the lowest orbital eccentricities in the local population , and a mean galactocentric radius nearly identical to that of the sun , and therefore a very similar galactic orbit .",

    "paper i ) , but not the needed overall irradiance ( strong lines + pseudo - continuum ) .",
    "we have compiled flux data of @xmath0  cet  in the uv and fuv .",
    "spectra covering from 93 to 118  nm are available from fuse and were discussed by @xcite and in paper i. here we have used only night - time data since the relevant h lyman lines are prone to contamination from geocoronal emission . the interstellar medium - corrected profile of the strong h ly @xmath1 line was taken from @xcite , which agrees well with the values provided in paper i. the rest of the spectrum ( i.e. , from h ly@xmath1 up to nearly 300 nm ) was taken from the coolcat catalogayres / coolcat/ ] , which compiles echelle spectroscopy obtained with the hst stis instrument . the combined spectrum , covering from 93 to 299  nm ( with a few small gaps ) ,",
    "was smoothed using a convolution with a gaussian of 0.3 nm fwhm and resampled at steps of 0.01  nm .",
    "the random uncertainties after such convolution are negligible above 200 nm ( well below 1% ) and then slowly increase towards shorter wavelengths to reach about 10% at 140 nm and 20% at 93 nm . at long wavelengths the dominant error will be that of the standard flux calibration but , according to stis specifications and the information in coolcat , the systematic uncertainty should not exceed 5% .    the @xmath0  cet  spectrum was compared with a spectrum of the sun obtained from @xcite , corresponding to medium solar activity .",
    "[ fig : comp ] illustrates such comparison .",
    "the left panel shows the normalized flux density at a distance of 1 au from both @xmath0  cet  and the current sun , while the right panel depicts the normalized flux ratio .",
    "the results clearly show that @xmath0  cet  is about 35% fainter than today s sun for wavelengths above 210 nm , a range completely dominated by thermal radiation ( except for the chromospheric emission of the h&k lines ) . below 210",
    "nm the difference in the ratio decreases to about 17% at 200 nm , 10% at 190 nm and the fluxes equal on average around 170 nm .",
    "some chromospheric lines start to appear below 185 nm and those are much stronger in the case of @xmath0  cet .",
    "shortward of 170 nm the relative flux of @xmath0  cet  increases up to about a factor of 4 at 120 nm and then even higher below . at those wavelengths most of the flux",
    "is dominated by chromospheric lines that are significantly stronger for @xmath0  cet .    the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] clearly illustrate how the sun , because of its higher temperature , possesses stronger photospheric uv radiation , yet , when the chromosphere emission is considered , @xmath0  cet   emissions are stronger because of its higher level of magnetic activity",
    ". the transition between photosphere and chromosphere in terms of emission is usually set at about 170 nm .",
    "however , note how in the interval between 170 nm and 210 nm , @xmath0  cet  is relatively brighter than expected .",
    "the flux ratio difference with the sun is about 1015% while about 35% is found at longer wavelengths .",
    "@xcite presented estimates of the uv flux for @xmath0  cet .",
    "the authors did not use measured uv data but employed astrophysical plasma models to generate synthetic flux distributions from an emission measure distribution ( emd ) .",
    "such emd was obtained from the analysis of x - ray and euv data , typically arising from coronal emission .",
    "the calculated uv fluxes , originating from much cooler plasma in the chromosphere , should thus be a crude approximation of reality",
    ". comparison of the fluxes obtained by @xcite is not possible beyond a general apparent agreement , but real data , also with much higher resolution , ought to be preferred .",
    "evidence presented here for the young solar analog @xmath0  cet  suggests that the sun was significantly more active in its past . this early activity for sun - like stars",
    "is known in the x / euv range and its evolution with the age of the star was studied in paper i. interestingly , @xmath0  cet  also exhibits enhanced fluxes in the @xmath6 100200 nm range .",
    "these emissions may have had an impact on the early evolution of earth s atmosphere and may have played a role in the origin and development of life on earth : it has been proposed , for instance , that uv radiation may help the synthesis of complex ribonucleotides in plausible early earth conditions @xcite . in this wavelength range , the solar emission drives the photochemistry and thus the molecular composition of planetary atmospheres .",
    "this can be gauged in fig .",
    "[ cross - sections ] , where we show uv photoabsorption cross sections of relevant molecules .    to illustrate how the spectral irradiance in the 100300  nm domain can influence the photochemistry , we have computed the photolysis rates in an early earth atmosphere subject to two different irradiance spectra .",
    "the first spectrum is that of @xmath0  cet .",
    "the second spectrum ( `` model '' ) is an educated guess of the uv spectral irradiance of the sun at 0.6  gyr based on our knowledge of stellar evolution and spectral synthesis , prior to the latests results of the sun in time program in paper i , and on the basic assumption that the solar activity has not changed during the last 3.9  gyr .",
    "this model of the young sun spectrum is obtained by adding a synthetic photospheric irradiance spectrum and an activity component .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was computed by f. castelli with the atlas9 model for the characteristics of the sun at 0.6 gyr ( @xmath72  l@xmath7 , @xmath2  = 5680  k ) , as derived from the y@xmath55 stellar evolution models . the short wavelength emission associated with activity is assumed to be that of today s sun .",
    "such activity component can be calculated as the difference between the observed spectrum @xcite and the photospheric synthetic spectrum .",
    "the difference , namely the activity component , becomes significant below about 200  nm and dominates below 175  nm .",
    "both spectral irradiances are scaled to 1  au .",
    "the spectra of this simple young sun model and @xmath0  cet  are compared in fig .",
    "[ best - guessed ] .",
    "we have considered two different atmospheric compositions ( see fig .",
    "[ photochem ] , top ) :    * a co@xmath73-rich atmosphere described in @xcite . in this model",
    "the enhanced level of co@xmath73 provides enough greenhouse warming to compensate for the faint luminosity of the sun 3.9  gyr ago .",
    "the abundance of h@xmath73 is obtained for the current volcanic emission and assuming a diffusion - limited rate for the escape of hydrogen to space .",
    "this atmosphere contains no organic species . * a more reduced atmosphere excerpted from @xcite , that differs from the previous one by a significant level of ch@xmath74 and some photochemically produced hydrocarbons ( in particular c@xmath73h@xmath73 and c@xmath73h@xmath75 ) . in @xcite , the source of ch@xmath74",
    "is assumed to be biogenic methanogenesis , but abiotic sources associated with hydrothermal activity are also plausible @xcite .",
    "both compositions include 1  bar of n@xmath73 as the main constituent . for both cases ,",
    "our atmospheric thermal profile has been deduced from a present day terrestrial profile , assuming a constant stratospheric temperature equal to 200  k between 14 and 60  km .",
    "this is of course not consistent with the detailed compositions but has little impact on the photolysis rates .",
    "also , the detailed composition from @xcite and @xcite were computed with a photochemical model that assumed different uv fluxes .",
    "the purpose here is not to run a consistent photochemical model , which will be the done in future studies , but to illustrate how the photodissociation rates for these atmospheric compositions are sensitive to an enhanced uv irradiance .",
    "photodissociation rates @xmath76 ( s@xmath18 ) at the altitude @xmath77 of the different absorbing species @xmath78 included in the model were computed in the range of wavelength @xmath79 $ ] as @xmath80 which requires beforehand the implementation of their absorption cross - sections @xmath81 , of their different photodissociation pathways @xmath82 each characterized by a quantum yield @xmath83 and of the incident stellar uv flux at every level in the atmosphere @xmath84 as well .",
    "this incident stellar flux @xmath85 was calculated as a function of the diurnally averaged unattenuated stellar flux at the top of the atmosphere @xmath86 by considering only the integrated molecular absorption and rayleigh scattering within molecular nitrogen n@xmath73 . @xmath87",
    "the photolysis rates computed for both atmospheric compositions and both uv spectral irradiances are shown in fig .",
    "[ photochem ] .",
    "these rates are found to be enhanced by a factor of 23 in the stratosphere and mesosphere for h@xmath73o and co@xmath73 and by a factor of 4 for organic compounds .",
    "these photodissociations produce the radicals that activate the photochemical evolution , which is controlled by several hundreds of individual reactions , coupled with the vertical mixing and the condensation of some species .",
    "the resulting set of equations behaves strongly non - linearly and can be very sensitive to the photolysis rates , which is why the uv spectrum has a critical influence .",
    "therefore , considering @xmath0  cet  as a close analog of our sun in its early times , such enhanced photodissociation rates were likely to trigger a peculiar atmospheric chemistry that we plan to investigate shortly by using a photochemical model of the primitive earth s atmosphere .",
    "the higher h@xmath73o photolysis , associated with the intense heating of the thermosphere by the strong euv irradiance , would also result in a higher escape rate of hydrogen to space , particularly important for the early evolution of mars and venus .",
    "the effect of the relatively strong uv fluxes is thus still significant for a 0.6 gyr old sun - like star , and is likely to play an even more important role for younger stars , and for the atmospheric processes that occurred during the earliest stages of our planet .    at wavelengths above 200  nm , the photospheric emission dominates and",
    "the spectrum can be computed using a stellar atmosphere model .",
    "however , the inaccuracy of synthetic spectra can have a significant effect on the photodissociation rates .",
    "this inaccuracy has various origins as , for instance , the opacities , the elemental abundances , the limb darkening / brightening .",
    "@xcite compared different models with observed stellar spectra , above 300  nm , and reported the occurrence of numerous patterns with widths of 0.5 - 1.5  nm , below 450  nm , with systematic uncertainties of about 10% .",
    "we noted even higher differences below 300  nm when comparing synthetic spectra obtained for the same stellar parameters but with different models .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ best - guessed ] that above 200  nm the synthetic model used for the young sun fluctuates around that of @xmath0  cet .",
    "this difference can be attributed to both the inaccuracy of the model and to the fact that @xmath0  cet  is a close but not exact replica of the sun , having a slightly different mass and metallicity .",
    "between 150 and 200 nm , the photon flux increases by more than two orders of magnitude . which means that a 10% error on a 1  nm bin at 200  nm represent 10 times more photons than all the flux in a 1  nm bin at 150  nm .",
    "we can thus wonder about the influence of this error on the photodissociation rates . in the atmosphere models we considered ,",
    "most of the species are photodissociated at wavelengths below 200  nm and most absorption cross - sections decrease by orders of magnitude between 150 and 200  nm . as a consequence , variations of the flux above 200  nm",
    "have a limited impact on the dissociation rates .",
    "for some species that absorb at @xmath88  nm ( like co@xmath73 or hydrocarbons ) , photolysis rates can be slightly higher in the lowest atmosphere when computed with the young sun model .",
    "but with the atmospheric compositions we considered , we checked that this effect remains negligible by comparing the rates from fig .",
    "[ photochem ] with rates computed when both spectra are set to the same values at wavelengths above 200  nm .",
    "we should stress however that other atmospheric compositions , involving species that have strong absorption cross - sections at @xmath88  nm ( like for instance so@xmath73 or o@xmath89 ) , would be much more sensitive to this part of the spectrum .",
    "this demonstrates that using both the observed spectrum of a young sun proxy and a theoretical model may be necessary for a full description of planetary atmospheres .",
    "in this paper we have carried out an in - depth study of the bright , nearby solar analog @xmath0  cet .",
    "several methods have been used to estimate its effective temperature and chemical composition , yielding preferred values of @xmath2  = 5665 @xmath3 30  k , and @xmath5 = + 0.10 \\pm   0.05 $ ] .",
    "the systematic offset between @xmath2  values obtained from photometry / line profiles and the excitation / ionization and equilibria is evidence of non - lte effects , probably related to uv overionization due to the strong magnetic activity of this star .",
    "adopting as the best atmospheric parameters the photometry and h@xmath1 profile @xmath2  and the metallicity , we have been able to set constraints to the stellar age , which should be between 0.4 and 0.8  gyr .",
    "all the information gathered indicates that @xmath0  cet  is a star with nearly 1 solar mass in a relatively unevolved evolutionary stage . as such",
    ", it is an excellent match to the sun as it was some 3.74.1 gyr ago .",
    "the radiation from the young sun must have played an essential role in shaping the atmospheres of the solar system planets . in particular ,",
    "the uv flux is responsible for the photochemical processes in the atmosphere .",
    "we have been able to compile data , taken both with fuse and hst , covering the entire uv and it shows that @xmath0  cet s flux is some 35% lower than the current sun s between 210 and 300 nm , it matches the sun s at 170 nm and increases to at least 27 times higher than the sun s between 110 and 140  nm .",
    "we have compared these fluxes with a `` theoretical '' young sun estimated by adding the current chromospheric flux to a photospheric model with the correct radiative properties .",
    "we have used a photochemical model to calculate the photodissociation rates of the most relevant molecules in the assumed composition of early earth s atmosphere .",
    "the results indicate that such rates should have been several times higher than those resulting from a simplistic `` theoretical '' solar spectrum .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that self - consistent planetary atmosphere calculations must account for the much stronger photodissociating radiation of the young sun",
    ". the resulting chemistry could be significantly different from that commonly assumed .",
