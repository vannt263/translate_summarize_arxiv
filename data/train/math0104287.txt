    "every simple finite dimensional lie algebra has a symmetrizable cartan matrix . moreover ,",

    "these cartan matrices correspond to dynkin diagrams and extended dynkin diagrams .",

    "@xmath12 n  shapovalov @xcite suggested a powerful method for description of irreducible highest weight @xmath12-modules ( verma modules and their quotients ) .",
    "the method ( a development of an idea due to gelfand and kirillov cf",

    "kac and kazhdan @xcite extended shapovalov s result to the lie algebras with _ any _ symmetrizable cartan matrix @xmath11 .",
    "namely , if @xmath11 is symmetrizable , then @xmath12 possesses a nondegenerate invariant bilinear form @xmath13 and with the help of the associated with @xmath13 quadratic casimir element @xmath1 they computed the shapovalov determinant for all such lie algebras .    using absence of zero divisors in the enveloping algebra of any lie algebra",
    ", they further obtained a description of irreducible modules that occur in the jordan ",
    "hlder series of an arbitrary verma module over these algebras .",
    "kac later conjectured a formula for the shapovalov determinant for the lie _",
    "super_algebras with symmetrizable cartan matrix @xcite ; the formula had an obvious mistake and a  correction was offered in @xcite , for the proof of the corrected formula see @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the formula for the determinant is a corollary of an explicit form of the quadratic casimir element .",
    "moreover , thanks to the existence of the casimir element , the shapovalov determinant turns out to be equal to the product of _ linear _ functions . for lie superalgebras with symmetrizable cartan matrix",
    "this element is even , so the argument of  @xcite are applicable literally .",

    "@xcite ) , ( b ) the form of the product of linear factors depends on properties of odd roots involved and is more complicated , see th .  2.4  @xcite .",
    "still , one obtains a criterion for irreducibility of verma modules .    * our result",
    "* : calculation of the even quadratic casimir element for simple finite dimensional lie superalgebras without symmetrizable cartan matrix .",
    "such are only the lie superalgebras @xmath14 of special hamiltonian vector fields .",

    "corollaries : a criterion for irreducibility of verma modules over all these algebras and calculation of the shapovalov determinant : it is the product of the linear terms - constituents of the above criterion .",
    "quantization sends @xmath4 and @xmath6 into lie superalgebras with cartan matrix  @xcite ; so our result can be read as a `` dequantization '' of the shapovalov determinant for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "another corollary related with existence of the quadratic casimir element is an explicit solution to the classical yang - baxter equation with values in the above lie superalgebras ; for finite dimensional simple lie superalgebras these solutions are given in  @xcite .",
    "since it is natural to describe poisson lie superalgebras as subalgebras of the lie superalgebra of contact vector fields , we describe them and recall our earlier result on the shapovalov determinant for @xmath18 .",
    "* related open problems*. 1 ) extension of our result to loop algebras is straightforward , elsewhere we will consider their `` kac  moody '' versions .",
    "\\2 ) even in the absence of the even quadratic casimir element one can define the shapovalov determinant provided the algebra possesses an involutive antiautomorphism which sends positive roots into negative ones . among lie superalgebras of type szglapg only stringy or `` superconformal '' lie superalgebras ( for their complete list see  @xcite ) possess this property together with relatives of the `` queer '' series and @xmath19 as well as _",
