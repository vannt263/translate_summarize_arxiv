    "the spectra depend also on quantum parameters as the dimension of the hilbert space and the character of the interaction with the environment , which governs the strength of the decoherence effects . however , under an assumption of strong classical chaos and a uniform coupling of the system analyzed with all the states of the @xmath32dimensional environment the spectral properties the corresponding evolution become _ universal _ : the spectrum consists of a leading eigenvalue equal to unity , while all other eigenvalues cover the complex disk of radius @xmath258 .    in the asymptotic limit @xmath228",
    "the density of complex eigenvalues becomes uniform in the disk , besides the region close to the real axis .",
