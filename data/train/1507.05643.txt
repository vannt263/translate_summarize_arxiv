    "<S> such systems can be considered atypical in the sense that degeneracy , which is usually a sign of symmetry , is naturally broken in typical systems due to stochastic perturbations . in particular , we prove a version of von neumann s quantum ergodic theorem , where a modified condition needs to hold in order to have normal typicality and ergodicity . as a result , we show that degeneracy of spectrum does not considerably modify the condition of the theorem , whereas the existence of resonance is more dominant for obstructing ergodicity . </S>"
