    "in the change - making problem we are given a set of coins and we wish to determine , for a given amount @xmath0 , what is the minimal number of coins needed to pay @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , given the coins @xmath1 , the minimal representation of @xmath2 requires @xmath3 coins ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this problem is a special case of the general knapsack problem with all coins of unit weights . in some cases",
    "the solution may be found by a greedy strategy that uses as many of the largest coin as possible , then as many of the next one as possible and so on .",
    "this greedy solution is optimal for the set of coins given above , but fails to be optimal in general .",
    "for instance , if we have coins @xmath5 , then the amount @xmath6 will be paid greedily as @xmath7 , while the optimal solution ( @xmath8 ) requires just two coins . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on the combinatorial properties of those sets of coins for which the greedy solution is always optimal .",
    "the sequence @xmath9 , where @xmath10 will be called a _ currency _ or _",
    "we always assume @xmath11 is the smallest coin to avoid problems with non - representability of certain amounts . for any amount @xmath0 by @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "we denote , respectively , the minimal number of coins needed to pay @xmath0 and the number of coins used when paying @xmath0 greedily ( for example , if @xmath14 then @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . the currency @xmath17 will be called _ orderly _ if for all amounts @xmath18 we have @xmath19 .",
    "if a coinage system @xmath17 is not orderly then any amount @xmath0 for which @xmath20 will be called a _",
    "counterexample_.    let us briefly summarize related work .",
    "magazine , nemhauser and trotter @xcite gave a necessary and sufficient condition to decide whether @xmath21 is orderly provided we know in advance that @xmath22 is orderly , the so - called one - point theorem ( see section [ section2 ] of the present paper ) .",
    "kozen and zaks @xcite proved , among other things , that the smallest counterexample ( if exists ) , does not exceed the sum of the two highest coins .",
    "they also asked if there is a polynomial - time algorithm that tests if a coinage system is orderly .",
    "such an algorithm was presented by pearson @xcite .",
    "it produces a set of @xmath23 `` candidates for counterexamples '' , which is guaranteed to contain the smallest counterexample if one exists .",
    "the rest of the algorithm is just testing these potential candidates , and the overall complexity is @xmath24 .",
    "a similar set of possible counterexamples ( perhaps not containing the smallest one ) , but of size @xmath24 , was given by tien and hu in @xcite ( see formula ( 4.20 ) and theorem 4.1 of that paper ) .",
    "it leads to an @xmath25 algorithm .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite were concentrating mainly on the error analysis between the greedy and optimal solutions .",
    "apparently jones @xcite was the only one who attempted to give a neat combinatorial condition characterizing orderly currencies , but his theorem suffered from a major error , soon pointed out by maurer @xcite .",
    "our paper has been paralleled by an independent work of cowen , cowen and steinberg @xcite about currencies whose all prefixes are orderly and about non - orderly currencies which can not be `` fixed '' by appending extra coins .",
    "the results contained in section [ section4 ] and a special case ( @xmath26 ) of theorem [ theoremprefixorderly ] of this paper have also been proved in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study some orderly coinage systems from a combinatorial viewpoint , motivated by the need to have some nice characterization .",
    "one of the motivations was the observation that _ if @xmath27 is an orderly currency , then the currency @xmath28 is also orderly _ , that will be generalized and proved in theorem [ theoremprefixorderly ] .",
    "going further , one may start with an orderly currency , take out some of its coins and ask if the remaining coins again form an orderly currency .",
    "the precise answer to this question , given in section [ section7 ] , will be a consequence of the results of sections [ section3 ] and [ section5 ] , where we prove some properties of the distances @xmath29 between the coins of an orderly currency . in section [ section4 ] these results",
    "will be used to give a complete description of orderly currencies with less than 6 coins . in section [ section6 ]",
    "we study the behaviour of the currencies obtained as prefixes of an orderly currency . some closing remarks and open problems",
    "are included in section [ section8 ] .",
    "if @xmath30 is a currency it will often be convenient to set @xmath31 .",
    "this will be especially useful whenever we want to choose , say , the first interval @xmath32 $ ] of length at least @xmath33 for some @xmath33 .",
    "the reader will see that in all applications the infinite interval will be as useful as proper intervals .",
    "there are three standard arguments that will be used repeatedly throughout this paper , so we quote them now to avoid excessive repetitions in the future .",
    "all the time we assume @xmath30 is orderly .",
    "first , suppose we have @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 has a representation that uses 2 coins .",
    "since @xmath38 is strictly between @xmath36 and @xmath39 its greedy representation must start with @xmath36 , followed ( since @xmath17 is orderly ) by just one other coin @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that there exists @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "the second argument is a slight modification of the first one ; namely , if @xmath43 and the number @xmath44 is not one of the coins , then @xmath45 .",
    "the third argument is a bit more complicated .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath46 we have @xmath47 .",
    "let us choose the largest @xmath48 for which @xmath49 ( such @xmath48 s exist , for instance @xmath50 ) .",
    "then @xmath51 ( here it is possible that @xmath52 ) , so we have @xmath53 .",
    "if we also have @xmath54 then , as before , there exist numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 such that :    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     on the other hand , there seem to be no coinage systems of type ` + + + ----`@xmath57`--+ ` for @xmath58 , but we have not been able to prove this .",
    "every set @xmath59 , where @xmath60 determines a sub - currency @xmath61 of any currency @xmath30 . from theorem [ theoremprefixorderly ]",
    "we know that if @xmath17 is orderly then the sub - currency determined by @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is also orderly .",
    "is this just a lonely phenomenon , or could a similar theorem be proved for some other sets @xmath64 ?    [ hered ] the set @xmath64 of the form given above will be called _ hereditary _ if the following is true :    for every orderly currency @xmath30 + the sub - currency determined by @xmath64 is also orderly    let us enumerate some interesting classes of subsets of @xmath65 :    * the singleton set @xmath66 * the sets @xmath67 for @xmath68 * the sets @xmath69 for @xmath63 * the sets @xmath70 for @xmath71 * the full set @xmath65    note that @xmath72 is a peculiar exception : it is _ not _ of type 4 ( an immediate example is @xmath73 for @xmath74 and its non - orderly sub - currency @xmath75 determined by @xmath72 ) .",
    "we already know that sets @xmath64 of type 1 , 2 , 3 or 5 are hereditary . in this section",
    "we shall prove that sets that are not specified in types 15 are not hereditary .",
    "should always be thought of as a subset of @xmath65 for a certain @xmath76 . in most cases",
    "@xmath76 will be implicit , but to improve clarity we shall sometimes stress this connection by writing @xmath77 .",
    "] we also conjecture that all sets @xmath64 of type 4 are hereditary , and we prove this conjecture under some mild additional assumptions .",
    "the general case remains open .    before proceeding with the elimination of non - hereditary subsets",
    "@xmath64 let us make a few observations .",
    "for any @xmath78 let @xmath79 denote the currency @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath79 is orderly of type ` + + + ` @xmath57`+-+ ` .",
    "* proof . *",
    "the prefix currency @xmath82 is clearly of type ` + + + ` @xmath57`++ ` .",
    "extending this by @xmath83 we get an orderly currency by the one - point theorem . the next prefix ,",
    "ending in @xmath84 is not orderly since @xmath85 is the smallest counterexample .",
    "the complete currency is orderly which can be proved easily by the techniques from the proof of theorem [ onept ] .    for any @xmath86 and @xmath87 let @xmath88 denote the currency : @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "this currency is orderly . moreover , if @xmath92 then @xmath93 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "the given currency is in fact of type ` + + + + ` @xmath57`+++ ` , which can be verified inductively by the one - point theorem : to check that @xmath94 is orderly for @xmath95 it suffices to observe that @xmath96 to prove the last statement note that @xmath97 and , if @xmath92 : @xmath98    [ obs3 ] an orderly currency may be extended by any multiple of its highest coin and the resulting currency will be orderly .    * proof . * a trivial consequence of the one - point theorem .",
    "the last observation will be used in the following way : suppose we want to prove that some set @xmath59 is not hereditary .",
    "first we find a shorter orderly currency @xmath99 , such that the sub - currency determined by @xmath100 is not orderly ( here @xmath101 ) and @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath0 be any counterexample for this sub - currency and let @xmath48 be any number for which @xmath104 .",
    "then the currency @xmath105 is orderly ( lemma [ obs3 ] ) and its sub - currency determined by @xmath64 is not , since all the added coins are too large to fix the problem with @xmath0 ( the exact form of @xmath106 is actually immaterial , it is important that its smallest element is at least @xmath107 ) .    the sets @xmath64 not of the form 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 are not hereditary .",
    "* let @xmath108 , @xmath109 , be such a set .",
    "let @xmath41 be the largest index for which @xmath110 ( i.e. @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) .",
    "we shall consider a few cases :    * case @xmath113*. here we employ the orderly currency @xmath114 .",
    "its sub - currency @xmath115 is not orderly .",
    "if @xmath116 then we are done , while for @xmath117 we must expand @xmath114 to an orderly currency with @xmath118 coins in the standard way described earlier .",
    "the resulting currency will have a disorderly sub - currency determined by @xmath64 .. in this case @xmath119 , since otherwise @xmath64 would be of the form @xmath120 or @xmath70 for some @xmath121 and these sets are of type 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "denote @xmath122 , @xmath123 and consider the currency @xmath88 with @xmath92 .",
    "its sub - currency @xmath124 is not orderly since the amount @xmath125 paid greedily splits into the coin @xmath34 and some of the coins @xmath126 , thus requiring at least @xmath127 coins , which is more than if it was paid with @xmath128 copies of @xmath36 .",
    "now it suffices to expand this currency to a currency with @xmath118 coins as previously .    * case @xmath129*. then @xmath130 , since otherwise @xmath64 would be of the form @xmath69 , which is of type 3 .",
    "let @xmath131 and @xmath132 and consider the currency @xmath88 with @xmath92 .",
    "the sub - currency @xmath133 is not orderly for the same reason as previously : the amount @xmath134 must be paid greedily with at least @xmath135 coins and the proof follows .",
    "* case @xmath136*. clearly @xmath137 , since sets of the form @xmath66 and @xmath67 are of type 1 and 2 .",
    "let @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "repeat the same arguments with the currency @xmath88 ( @xmath92 ) and its sub - currency @xmath140 : this time the amount @xmath134 must be paid greedily with at least @xmath141 coins .",
    "sets @xmath64 of type 4 are the most peculiar ones .",
    "we believe they are also hereditary ; that is , we have the following :    [ contype4 ] if @xmath30 is orderly , then the currency @xmath142 is also orderly for every @xmath71 .",
    "while this is not known to be true in general , we can prove this conjecture under some mild additional conditions .",
    "[ theorempartialconjecture ] conjecture [ contype4 ] is true if we additionally assume that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "* we shall verify that @xmath142 is orderly by proposition [ lemma4 ] .",
    "let @xmath145 .",
    "by theorem [ theorembigdiff ] for every @xmath78 we have the first of the following inequalities : @xmath146 it means that @xmath147 , so there is no new coin between @xmath36 and @xmath148 , and the greedy decomposition of @xmath148 with respect to @xmath17 involves only the coins @xmath149 .",
    "this justifies the first equality in the following comparison : @xmath150 and by proposition [ lemma4 ] the proof is complete .",
    "throughout this paper we have proposed some possible approaches to the problem of describing orderly coinage systems and their interesting properties . some of these techniques have enabled us to prove the most important results of this paper , namely the structural theorems , like theorem [ theoremdiffaa ] and corollary [ possibletoa2 ] , or to give concise descriptions of small systems .",
    "there is still quite a lot of work to be done in the following areas :    * * sub - currencies * : prove conjecture [ contype4 ] , thus completing the classification of orderly sub - currencies . * * prefix sub - currencies * : invent an algorithm to decide whether a given @xmath151pattern describes a non - empty class or devise some other properties of such @xmath151patterns .",
    "another interesting conjecture , to which we have not found a counterexample , is : + if a @xmath151class is non - empty , then it has a representative @xmath30 with @xmath152 . * * differences * : can corollary [ possibletoa2 ] be generalized ?",
    "in other words , what can be said about the differences @xmath29 that belong to @xmath153 for some @xmath48 ?",
    "is it true that in general @xmath154 where @xmath155 for an orderly currency @xmath17 ?",
    "we already know this is true for @xmath156 .",
    "the lemmas from section [ section6 ] provide some partial results in the general case as well . * * extending * : theorem [ theoremdiffaa ] , corollary [ possibletoa2 ] and conjecture [ contype4 ] can be thought of as _ obstructions _ against extending : if a currency does not satisfy one of these conditions then it can not be extended to an orderly currency by appending new coins of high denominations ( higher than all the existing coins ) .",
    "what are the other invariants of this sort ?",
    "is there an algorithm that decides if a currency can be extended to an orderly one ?",
    "problems related to obstructions and extending can also be found in @xcite .",
