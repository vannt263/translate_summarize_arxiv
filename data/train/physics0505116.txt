    "computer simulations are nowadays an integral part of contemporary basic and applied research in the physical sciences .",
    "modern computational environments are widely used in industry as well .",
    "computation is nowadays as important as theory and experiment .",
    "the ability `` to compute '' is now part of the essential repertoire of research scientists .",
    "several new fields have emerged and strengthened their positions in the last years , such as computational materials science , bioinformatics , computational mathematics and mechanics , computational chemistry and physics , just to mention a few .",
    "since computation enjoys such an important standing in the natural sciences and mathematics , we feel that our undergraduate curriculum should reflect this feature as well .    for this reason it seems obvious that university students in the physical sciences should get an education which reflects , in a coherent way ( see the discussion below ) , how computers are used to solve problems in basic and applied research as well as in industry . sadly , this is normally not the case .",
    "such an education combines in principle knowledge from many different subjects , such as numerical analysis , computing languages and some knowledge of computers .",
    "these topics are , almost as a rule of thumb , taught in different , and we would like to add , disconnected courses . only at the level of his / her thesis work is the student confronted with the synthesis of all these subjects .",
    "the usage of computers in solving problems in physics is often postponed to the master- or phd - programs . in order to prepare better our students for their future careers and studies",
    ", we believe firmly that it is important to incorporate computational topics at an as early as possible stage in for example the undergraduate curriculum in physics . with the advances made in modern computational environments ,",
    "which often include powerful tools to visualize immediately the results , we feel time is ripe for introducing such tools in the undergraduate curriculum .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the introduction of numerical exercises can improve the learning environment and even add further physics insights to the more standard analytic exercises . by using interpreted languages and computational environments like mathematica , maple , matlab etc , modeling often takes considerably less time than the more old - fashioned and traditional computing tools , which often are based on large fortran and/or c / c++ programs and specialized visualization packages . through our new educational university reform",
    "we have therefore started a project where the main aim is to gradually include computational exercises throughout the undergraduate studies in mathematics and physics .",
    "programming languages such as java and an interpreted language like matlab are introduced as early as the first and the second semester of the bachelor programs in mathematics , informatics and technology ( mit ) and physics , astronomy and meteorology ( fam ) at the university of oslo .",
    "the usage and properties of these languages are added upon in later courses . at the end of the second semester",
    "the students are fully familiar with the syntax of for example matlab and can use this environment professionally in more advanced undergraduate courses .",
    "this allows teachers in topics like electromagnetism or the introductory course in quantum physics to present more realistic problems , which hopefully convey further physics insights and make physics much more fun . at the end of their bachelor studies ,",
    "our students are also exposed to other computational tools such as maple or mathematica and more traditional courses in computational sciences , courses which involve descriptions of algorithms and advanced problems solved with languages like c / c++ .",
    "the strategy for solving physics problems , which we have opted , is very close to the traditional one described by several textbook authors .",
    "young and freedman @xcite describe it as isee : identify , set up , execute and evaluate .",
    "the numerical methods only replace some of the pure analytical tasks that make up the execute part of this diagram .",
    "our approach is an algorithmic one , which stresses the understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "this is also the reason we prefer tools like matlab or maple , where the students , under guidance , have to model the actual physical systems .",
    "this approach should be contrasted to the widespread use of applets to demonstrate physics problems .",
    "many people think computers already are included in the physics education . in one way",
    "this is correct .",
    "thousands of applets have been written for physics alone , and by these applets students may for example visualize the path of a ball through air",
    ". these applets may be useful as a pedagogical tool , hopefully giving the students a better understanding of various phenomena .",
    "however , the usage of applets made by others do not necessarily increase the students ability to solve physics problems in general .",
    "an applet made by others is very seldom to much use when the student is to solve physics problems in a later job .",
    "furthermore , it is often difficult to get a close relationship to an applet made by others , since one often feels insecure about what is actually going on below the surface of the applet , that is , how the modeling in fact is done . in our experience ,",
    "use of applets , for these reasons , has a more limited importance than one would expect .    in the next section we present the basic structure of our program on computers in science education",
    "applied to the bachelor programs fam and mit , with an emphasis on the physics program .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] presents examples of numerical exercises the students are exposed to during their two first years of physics studies . finally , we present our summaries and perspectives in sec .  [",
    "sec : sec4 ] .",
    "we started to implement numerical exercises in our undergraduate courses back in 1999 .",
    "the first few years we implemented the new tools in two or three mathematics and physics courses only , with mixed experiences . at that time",
    "many undergraduate students were not familiar with programming concepts in the natural sciences , except for an introductory ( not mandatory ) programming course , where typically some high - level language like java was taught .",
    "the students which attended this course would perhaps not meet computational problems before they embarked on their master or phd thesis , with typical time spans from when they learned computing till they started on a thesis project of three to four years .",
    "the emphasis of this programming course was and still is on general concepts , with few , if any , applications to problems from the physical sciences .",
    "another important problem was and still is that of the readiness of our teachers .",
    "very few were and still are familiar with the new programming tools and could therefore not aid in an efficient way our students in solving problems .",
    "finally , the infrastructure with computer labs , software , operating systems etc was not optimal , or it was not clear which solution to choose , for large classes of students .",
    "since then we have benefited from several advances .",
    "we have invested in instruction labs with computers , in addition we have general computer rooms that are open most of the day .",
    "we also have wireless networks in all common rooms so that students can link their laptops to the local network and get access to different software packages , course pages with exercises , lecture notes etc .",
    "both linux and windows environments are available , and there is some support for mac os .",
    "student versions at low prices exist for many of the interpreted languages .    however , in spite of the above improvements we feel that three basic problems still persist .",
    "these are    * how to gradually bring in computational aspects in most of our undergraduate courses without taking away the attention from the basic topics which have to be covered .",
    "the standard complaint from many university teachers is that computational exercises bring in an additional complication to an already difficult topic and they do not wish to spend time on it during the regular classes .",
    "* most teachers are not familiar with many of the new programming tools .",
    "a dedicated program to increase the level of knowledge of our teachers is needed for this program to be successful .",
    "* finally , to make meaningful exercises which go beyond the available body of very good analytic exercises and can trigger further insights represents perhaps the greatest challenge we face .    through our recent university reform dating from the fall 2003 and an extensive collaboration with the bachelor program in mathematics ( mit ) ,",
    "we have now established a project called computers in science education , where the aim is to address the above three topics .",
    "the reform of 2003 introduced a three - year bachelor program , a two - year master program and finally a three - year phd program .",
    "the introduction of the bachelor program allowed us to re - model the undergraduate curriculum , implying a large degree of common and compulsory courses in physics , informatics and mathematics .",
    "our two bachelor programs have typically 200 - 300 new students every year , with roughly 100 starting with physics , astronomy and meteorology .",
    "our physics and mathematics students follow the same courses the first semester .",
    "the first semester consists of a standard mathematics course on analysis and calculus , one on programming ( java ) and finally a course on modeling and mathematics applications .",
    "the latter two courses introduce programming concepts using java , operating systems such as linux and windows , use of editors , numerical algorithms for integration and solution of differential equations , representations of numbers , roots of transcendental equations and so forth .",
    "this gives our students a common and uniform background in various tools and programming environments .",
    "our students meet matlab applications the second semester through the mechanics course ( see section [ sec : sec3 ] ) , a mathematical course on field theory and vector analysis and a course on linear algebra .",
    "the latter two courses are also part of the bachelor program in mathematics whereas the mechanics course is optional for mathematicians    our students are thus exposed to programming topics and numerical exercises in five out of six undergraduate courses the first year of study .",
    "this allows us to portion out the computational learning threshold over time and in different courses , avoiding thereby much of the well - known criticisms discussed above .    with this caveat",
    "we are able to give our students a uniform background in computational skills , skills which can then be used in solving slightly more advanced problems , without taking away the attention from the interesting physics .",
    "the second year of study begins then with a course on electromagnetism , an optional course on astrophysics / meteorology and an advanced linear algebra and calculus course .",
    "the electromagnetism course contains several numerical exercises , including even solutions of partial differential equations such as laplace s equation .",
    "matlab is used in solving such problems .",
    "the second year ends with the spring semester and with an introductory course on quantum physics , a course on wave equations and oscillations and an experimental physics course .",
    "all these courses offer numerical exercises and use computers for project writing . at this stage",
    "most students are fairly familiar with computational topics .",
    "the last year of the bachelor degree contains more advanced topics , including topics such as statistical physics , mathematical physics , computational physics , solid state physics , subatomic physics , advanced quantum mechanics and so forth .",
    "here it is up to the various teachers whether they wish to include numerical exercises or not .",
    "however , the background of the students for doing this is now much better than previously .    to meet the needs of our university teachers",
    "we have developed and arrange on a regular basis intensive one week courses on various computer tools .",
    "we have developed courses on matlab , maple , visualization tools , fortran95 , c / c++ , scripting languages and high - performance computing .",
    "all course material is available on the net for self - study , with a large body of exercises . for links to these courses",
    "see ref .",
    "most of the material is in english .    below we discuss two examples of physics exercises which can be solved using matlab .",
    "we had several aims in mind when we embarked on computational exercises in our undergraduate physics courses .    * we wanted to give the students an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the physics . in most courses one",
    "is normally confronted with simple systems which provide exact solutions and mimic to a certain extent the realistic cases .",
    "many are however the comments like why ca nt we do something else than the classical box potential in quantum mechanics? in several of the numerical exercises we propose more realistic cases to solve by various numerical methods .",
    "this also means that we wish to give examples of how physics can be applied in a much broader context than it is discussed in the traditional physics undergraduate curriculum . * to encourage the students to `` discover '' physics in a way similar to how researchers learn in the context of research .",
    "our overall goal is to encourage the students to learn science through experience and by asking questions .",
    "our objective is always a deeper understanding .",
    "the purpose of computing is further insight , not mere numbers ! moreover , and this is our personal bias , to device an algorithm and thereafter write a code for solving physics problems is a marvelous way of gaining insight into complicated physical systems .",
    "the algorithm one ends up writing reflects in essentially all cases the understanding of the physics of the problem .    below we discuss two simple applications which illustrate the above aims , one from our mechanics course ( second semester of the first year of study ) and the other from our introductory course in quantum physics ( second semester of the second year of study ) .",
    "it would have been practically impossible to treat a realistic projectile motion for a football by using the traditional analytical tools alone .",
    "the reason is that the air resistance varies in a rather complicated way for the football problem .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] displays the air resistance coefficient for a spherical ball moving through air ( for corresponding equations , see below ) . the initial slope for low speeds makes the air resistance approximately proportional with the speed . in the plateau region of the curve , the air resistance is roughly proportional with the square of the speed .",
    "however , for really high ball speeds , which professional football players actually obtain , the air resistance drops drastically .        since there are no single purely analytical expression with constant coefficients that can be used to describe the air - resistance throughout the projectile motion for a football , it is impossible to work out a solution in closed form .",
    "however , when we solve the projectile motion by numerical methods , only approximately five to ten extra lines of code are needed in order to include all the details of figure 2 in the calculations .",
    "the full matlab code for this problem , implementing euler s method for solving a second order differential equation , and plotting of the results , can easily be written with 50 lines of code .",
    "this represents a manageable problem for our students .",
    "once such a program is written , it can easily be modified to quite different problems . with a few changes it can for example handle a realistic rocket launch ( for scientific rockets that our department sends up in the atmosphere in order to study auroras ) . in the rocket problem",
    "almost every thinkable parameter changes during the flight ( for example , the rocket engine thrust , the air resistance and even the gravitation force ) .",
    "the expression for the air resistance we use is given by the following : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the density of the air , @xmath2 is the cross section of the ball , @xmath3 is the air resistance coefficient , @xmath4 is the speed , and @xmath5 is the velocity of the ball ( a vector ) .",
    "it is the variation of the coefficient @xmath3 that is displayed in figure 2 .",
    "the reynolds number is proportional with the velocity , as usual .",
    "when using numerical methods , focus tends to be on newton s second law , not on for example the final integrated solutions for the simplified system without air resistance .",
    "furthermore , the students realize that the execute part of figure 1 , is merely a tool part that is rather separate from the physics involved . in the traditional approach",
    "the mathematics part ( execute part ) is often focused on to such a degree that it is common to think that that part is the important one in the problem solving , whereas the opposite often is the case .",
    "thus , by introducing numerical methods , the students can more easily grasp what is the important physics in the problem , and what is not . and",
    "again , the realism of the problem helps to inspire the students in their work .    on the other hand ,",
    "our approach is more demanding than the traditional one .",
    "of course it is easier to use blindly the final equations for a projectile motion without air resistance , than to solve a more realistic problem , since in the latter case the students must go somewhat deeper into the problem .",
    "our approach therefore tends to some degree to exclude our weakest students .",
    "this represents a challenge to your physics education .",
    "the above is just one of many examples of physics exercises included in our undergraduate courses .",
    "other numerical exercises included in for example our mechanics ( second semester ) and electromagnetism ( third semester ) courses are    1 .   hunting gun bullet ( ballistic ) movement with complex description of air resistance .",
    "2 .   rocket launching with almost all realistic parameters .",
    "mathematical and physical pendulum with large amplitudes .",
    "4 .   chaotic motion . 5 .   planetary movement , position of planets compared to the background star sky .",
    "calculate magnetic field from arbitrary current geometries , based on biot - savart s law .",
    "transients when a forced harmonic oscillation starts , for different q - factors .",
    "different forms for electromagnetic waves , animations .",
    "combined effects of various potentials ( e.g. electrostatic and gravitational ) .",
    "in the traditional first course in quantum physics ( which at our university is taught towards the end of the second year ) , students are exposed to topics like one - dimensional potential problems represented by the harmonic oscillator , the standard square well potential and the hydrogen atom .",
    "in addition , the students get a basic understanding of the periodic system , molecular physics , some nuclear , particle and solid state physics .",
    "the more formal mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is presented in a senior undergraduate course in the fifth semester of study ( beginning of the last year of the bachelor degree ) .    a standard textbook exercise the students",
    "could be exposed to is to solve schrdinger s equation for a particle confined in a one - dimensional square well potential , given by for example figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this exercise can not be solved analytically .",
    "( 13,6 ) ( 0,0.5)(0,0)[bl ] ( 8,1)(1,0)4 ( 12.3,1)(0,0)x ( 5.1,1.5)(0,0)@xmath6 ( 8.1,1.5)(0,0)@xmath7 ( 4,0)(0,0)@xmath8 ( 6,0)(0,0)@xmath9 ( 10,0)(0,0)@xmath10 ( 8.5,-3)(0,0)@xmath11 ( 5,1)(0,-1)4 ( 5,1)(-1,0)3 ( 5,-3)(1,0)3 ( 8,1)(0,-1)4    the one - dimensional schrdinger equation takes the following form @xmath12 and can be rewritten @xmath13 note that @xmath14 . for regions @xmath8 and @xmath10 the potential is zero and we have @xmath15 with @xmath16 . in region",
    "@xmath9 @xmath17 , resulting in @xmath18 where @xmath19 is real and positive . in all three regions",
    "we have simple second - order differential equations with their pertinent boundary equations .",
    "the standard exercise the students are exposed to ( and we claim this is done in an almost uniform way all over the world ) is to set up schrdinger s equation for these three regions and show that one can obtain a set of transcendental equations for the energy and thereby the wave functions .",
    "they would typically proceed by setting up the general solutions for regions @xmath8 and @xmath10 as follows @xmath20 and @xmath21 similarly , they would show that for region @xmath9 one arrives at @xmath22 the coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all unknown .",
    "the students have to distinguish between symmetric and antisymmetric solutions , meaning that the wave functions obey either @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "this gives @xmath31 for the symmetric case and @xmath32 for the antisymmetric case .",
    "in addition , the wave functions have to be bounded .",
    "the final step is to use the requirement that the wave function is continuous at @xmath33 and @xmath34 and after some minor algebra the students arrive at @xmath35 resulting in the the following transcendatal equations @xmath36 for the symmetric solution and @xmath37 for the antisymmetric case .    in the traditional approach , this is normally where one would stop .",
    "the emphasis is then obviously only on the mathematical manipulations in order to arrive at the two final equations .",
    "one could always plug in values for the potential and its range resulting in analytical functions , however this limits very much the physics investigations which can be made with modern tools .",
    "as an example , matlab , maple and mathematica all have functions for solving numerically the above non - linear equations and the students can easily investigate the number of solutions as function of the depth of the potential and its range .",
    "they can also write their own algorithms for solving such equations .",
    "the next step is to use the eigenvalues to obtain the wave functions and plot these as function of the potential depth and the range .",
    "a useful exercise is to study the behavior of the wave function as the range of the potential increases .",
    "the oscillating wave function one then sees from the plot corresponds to the case of a free particle .",
    "these problems can easily be solved with most of the above tools , providing the students with an extremely useful tool for asking further physics questions . the simplest way to implement",
    "the above is then as follows    1 .",
    "use the functions of matlab , maple or mathematica for solving non - linear equations . obtain the eigenvalues as function of the depth and the range of the potential .",
    "2 .   write a small code which includes these solutions and obtains the eigenfunctions for the symmetric and the antisymmetric case .",
    "plot these functions and compare to the free particle case .",
    "most students are capable of implementing the above two steps .",
    "there is no need to consider the solution of differential equations with boundary problems and our experience is that the students find the immediate visualization of the results as very rewarding and interesting .",
    "such a code is however not extendable to more interesting cases such as the hydrogen atom or the harmonic oscillator .",
    "one can increase the degree of numerical complexity by letting the students write more generic codes for single - particle problems .",
    "matlab offers a set of functions for solving differential equations with boundary conditions .",
    "this is exposed in the following matlab code for the particle in a square well potential .",

    "it allows , by simply changing the differential equations , the boundary conditions and the potential , to attack many other single - particle problems and provides thereby a generic background which is independent of the specific physics problem .",
    "this is obviously in line with modern computing concepts which our students are exposed to in courses on programming concepts .",
    "as such it allows one to focus on the basic physics , represented by the boundary conditions and the potential .",
    "this abstraction is however difficult for most students , and a balance has to been sought .",
    "it is also a much more difficult procedure to grasp as it hides the solution of a differential equation with boundary conditions . on average ,",
    "the students find the usage of the above approach rather difficult since the way it is coded is fairly compact . by presenting this algorithm here",
    "we also expose a difficulty inherent to most modern languages like maple or matlab .",
    "the coding of the physics represented by the boundary conditions and the potential is highly non - trivial and non - transparent .",
    "it would be much better if the students could code directly the boundary conditions , the potential and the differential equation to be solved in a way which is close to the mathematics .    in the fourth semester most students are not familiar with such problems and we do no recommend to use such an approach .",
    "the students need to provide the boundary conditions on the wave function and its derivative based on the symmetry of the solution , they need to code the potential itself and the form of the second - order differential equation . our experience when we used the above more generic approach , is that it is actually better to let the students code explicitely the shooting method for finding the eigenvalues .",
    "this is however more time - demanding than the steps outlined prior to the code above .",
    "the new approach in physics education at our university has been rather successful as far as we can judge .",
    "we can summarize the benefts and problems as follows :      * the students meet more interesting and realistic problems than before * we believe this helps in motivating and inspiring our students to pursue a physics career . * the choice between traditional analytical mathematical tools alone and the same tools combined with numerical tools , clarifies in a better way what is the important physics and which are the useful tools to be used in problem solving .",
    "* we can devote more time on the core physics equations . *",
    "the students get an expertise that can make them more productive in their future jobs and careers .",
    "* it gives the university teachers a greater advantage since it brings the students closer to the way we do research .",
    "it is more fun to teach .",
    "our experience is that we gain much more insights ourselves than in the more traditional approaches since we can address much more interesting questions .",
    "* many university teachers do not know how to use the new tools .",
    "we offer therefore several intensive courses in order to upgrade the knowledge of our staff .",
    "* however , there will always be a certain number of teachers who do not like to spend time on the new tools since that leaves less time for traditional teaching and /or student activities .",
    "parts of this reluctance is due to pure inertia , but most of the criticism is very actual , and care has to be exercised so that the time spent on numerical methods does not become too large compared with the total activity .",
    "* we have to give more individual instructions and feedback to the students than before .",
    "we end up using more teaching resources .",
    "* very few textbooks offer problems where numerical methods are required for obtaining a solution , thus : - we have to develop new problems ourselves .",
    "it takes time but it is definitely worth it .",
    "* some of the weaker students have problems in getting through the new courses , whereas the clever students enjoy the flexibility that the new tools give them .",
    "this represents a clear pedagogical challenge to our physics education ."
