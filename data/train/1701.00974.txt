    "landau - zener - stueckelberg ( lzs ) interferometry is encountered when a parameter of a quantum system are varied periodically in time such that the system repeatedly traverses an avoided crossing in its energy level diagram @xcite .",
    "the response of the quantum system under such strong driving exhibits characteristic two - dimensional interference patterns that reflect the effects of interference involving the two traversals in a single driving period as well as the interference between operations corresponding to different driving periods .",
    "this situation has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years , covering both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite .    in the lzs problem , the driving field",
    "is generally treated classically , and only the driven two - level system is treated quantum mechanically . this picture can be considered a semiclassical approximation of a fully quantum treatment where the sinusoidal driving field is replaced by a harmonic oscillator that contains a large number of photons and hence behaves classically .",
    "one can then ask the question : what happens when the driving field is treated quantum mechanically ? in this paper we use the rabi model to address this question .",
    "the closest that one can come to a classical signal in a quantum harmonic oscillator is a coherent state .",
    "indeed we show that in the semiclassical limit with coherent states containing a large number of excitation quanta the predictions of the semiclassical and fully quantum models agree , although the results are described by seemingly different mathematical functions .",
    "one can expect that for coherent states with a small number of excitation quanta the discreteness of the oscillator s energy levels and the fluctuations in photon number relative to the average value start to have noticeable effects on the dynamics of the driven two - level system .",
    "we find that these are not the only deviations that the fully quantum model exhibits in relation to the semiclassical model .",
    "for example , starting with a well - defined photon number one could still obtain non - decaying sinusoidal oscillations but with a frequency that is completely different from what the semiclassical model predicts .",
    "we shall analyze this point and other similarities and differences in the predictions of the two models .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassicalandquantumpictures ] we introduce the semiclassical and fully quantum models for describing a driven two - level system . in sec .",

    "[ sec : strongdriving ] we address the case of strong driving and lzs interferometry , as seen in the semiclassical and quantum models .",
    "we analyze the expressions for the rabi frequency in the two models and compare the two expressions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : timedomainsimulations ] we present the results of time - domain simulations of the dynamics , giving a different perspective on the problem .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a two - level quantum system ( to which we shall also refer as a qubit ) driven by an external field with a sinusoidal time dependence .",
    "specifically , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the minimum energy gap at the avoided crossing point , @xmath2 is the average bias point relative to the so - called symmetry point ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the amplitude , frequency and phase of the sinusoidal driving signal , and @xmath7 are qubit pauli operators .",
    "when @xmath8 exceeds @xmath2 by an amount that is large compared to @xmath1 , the coefficient of the second term in the hamiltonian oscillates between positive and negative values such that a sequence of landau - zener traversals is encountered , and the physics of lzs interferometry is realized .    the semiclassical hamiltonian given in eq .",

    "( [ eq : semiclassicalhamiltonian ] ) and that our results do not depend on this particular choice .",
    "note also that we include the term proportional to @xmath13 , which is sometimes omitted from the jc hamiltonian .",
    "when the cavity is treated classically , its field operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 are replaced by the classical field values @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 taken as a positive real number .",
    "given a number of photons @xmath17 and noting that @xmath18 , the replacement of the quantum operators by the classical field values gives the amplitude of the classical field as @xmath19 .",
    "as a result , in order to describe the same field intensity in the two models described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : semiclassicalhamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : quantumhamiltonian ] ) , one must set @xmath20 in order to obtain fuller correspondence between the semiclassical and quantum treatments , the phases @xmath6 and @xmath21 must also be set to the same value , and we shall set both of them to zero for simplicity here .",
    "first let us consider the simple case of weak driving , which is the case studied by rabi in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) and we assume that the driving is weak ( i.e.  @xmath24 ) , we find that the two - level quantum system undergoes rabi oscillations with frequency @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",

    "apart from the ground state , the low energy levels are grouped into pairs with energies @xmath42 above the ground state energy , with corresponding eigenstates given by @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that the energy eigenstates are quantum superpositions of this form naturally leads to rabi - like oscillations .",
    "if , for example , the system is initially set in a state with the qubit in its ground state @xmath44 and the cavity in a state with @xmath17 photons , and hence the combined system is initially in the state @xmath45 , the system will undergo oscillations between the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 with frequency @xmath47 .",
    "obviously the two descriptions above , with oscillation frequencies given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are essentially equivalent and give the same value for the rabi frequency when we set @xmath50 .",

    "it is interesting that considering the same physical problem from two different perspectives has led us to infer a relationship between two mathematical functions that are not obviously related .",

    "the field is an externally given function of time that is not affected by the state of the driven system . in the quantum picture ,",
    "any change in the state of the qubit will be accompanied by a change in the state of the cavity .",
    "for example , the excitation of the qubit from the ground to the excited state in a @xmath55-photon resonance will be accompanied by the absorption of @xmath55 photons from the cavity .",
    "the alert reader might have already noticed that the expression that we used for the semiclassical model contains the photon number @xmath17 , even though the oscillations involve alternation between @xmath17 and @xmath87 photons .",
    "taking this point into consideration , one might think that it would be better to set the classical field @xmath8 to @xmath88 instead of @xmath89 .",
    "a closer inspection of the functions plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : rabifrequencyweakcoupling]-[fig : rabifrequencystrongcoupling ] reveals that the situation is somewhat more complicated .",

    "[ fig : rabifrequencyweakcoupling ] .",
    "the term @xmath91 is therefore consistently there .",
    "however , we also have the additional 0.5 whose origin is not clear . from fitting the data for all the combinations of @xmath92 and @xmath93",

    "we do not know the origin of the last two terms inside the square - root .",
    "we also note that for small values of @xmath17 this formula gave good agreement for small values of @xmath75 , but deviations between the two expressions persisted , especially for @xmath95 , where no value of the shift seemed to consistently reduce the deviations .",
    "another back - action effect arises naturally if for a moment we consider what happens when we choose parameters that do not satisfy resonance conditions . in this case",
    "the energy eigenstates are divided into two groups corresponding to the qubit states @xmath96 and @xmath97 , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : grwabasisstates ] ) .",
    "the cavity part of each one of these energy eigenstate is described by a fock state , just as in an isolated harmonic oscillator , but with a qubit - state - dependent displacement .",
    "if the qubit is prepared in one of the states @xmath96 and @xmath97 and the cavity is initially prepared in a coherent state , then the cavity field will undergo oscillations with frequency @xmath5 about a qubit - state - dependent equilibrium point that is shifted from the origin by @xmath98 . even if we choose parameters that satisfy a resonance condition , these oscillations will occur on short timescales . on longer timescales , specifically the timescale of rabi oscillations",
    ", the qubit will undergo oscillations between the states @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the cavity field will adjust its oscillation pattern such that it remains correlated with the qubit s state .",
    "for example , after a full transfer of probability from the state @xmath96 to the state @xmath97 or vice versa the cavity field will have shifted the origin of its oscillations by @xmath99 . as discussed above , the amplitude of the cavity field oscillations will also change because of the absorption or emission of @xmath55 photons in a @xmath55-photon resonance .",
    "we now present the results of simulations where we solve the schrdinger equation and obtain the qubit state populations as functions of time in the semiclassical and fully quantum models .",
    "we take the case of two - photon resonance @xmath100 .",
    "we choose a driving amplitude @xmath101 ( or an equivalent value of @xmath17 in the quantum model ) , which gives constructive interference and therefore a reasonably high rabi frequency . for the qubit gap we choose the value @xmath102 , which is relatively large and clearly shows the step - like dynamics that is one of the characteristics of lzs interferometry @xcite .     of the qubit state @xmath97 as a function of time @xmath103 with driving amplitude @xmath101 , qubit bias @xmath104 and qubit gap @xmath102 .",
    "the red line is obtained from the semiclassical model .",
    "the green line , which is shifted down by 0.25 in order to make it resolvable from the red line , is obtained from the quantum model with the cavity initially set in a coherent state with @xmath105 , and the coupling strength @xmath12 is chosen such that @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath101 .",

    "when we extend the simulations to longer timescales , we see a decay in the oscillations with a decay time of @xmath111 .",
    "this value for the decay time is rather large considering that the quantum fluctuations in @xmath17 in such a coherent state are @xmath112 , which is about 3% of the mean photon number .",
    "the reason for this weak decay is that the point @xmath101 is very close to a maximum in @xmath113 and fluctuations up to 3% in @xmath4 do not result in large fluctuations in @xmath114 .",
    "when we change the parameters such that we now have @xmath110 100 photons in the coherent state , we see very fast decay in the oscillations , with a decay time of only a few times the rabi oscillation period .",
    "the quantum fluctuations in @xmath17 are now on the order of 10% , which means that the rabi frequency varies significantly for the different fock states that make up this coherent state .",
    "interestingly , if we use a fock state with exactly 100 photons and the coupling strength adjusted to the appropriate value , we recover decay - less oscillations with a frequency that is essentially identical to that obtained from the semiclassical calculation .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , because coherent states are generally expected to give the closest similarity to classical fields .",
    "when we reduce the average number of photons in the coherent state to 10 , the decay becomes so fast that we can barely see the rabi oscillations , and instead of the step - like dynamics that is characteristic of lzs interferometry we now see only a few frequency components in the dynamics .",
    "we have treated the problem of landau - zener - stueckelberg interferometry when the driving field is in the quantum regime .",
    "we have found that the quantum treatment reproduces the results of the semiclassical treatment when the qubit - cavity coupling strength is small or the number of photons in the cavity is large . in this case",
    "the expressions containing laguerre polynomials that are typical in the study of the rabi model coincide with the expressions that contain bessel functions and are typical in strong - driving problems .",
    "the semiclassical expression is no longer applicable , however , for large values of @xmath75 and small values of @xmath17 . in this case , not only do quantum fluctuations cause decaying oscillations in the time - domain , but the @xmath17 dependence of the rabi frequency itself shows differences in the predictions of the two models .    in our simulations of the rabi model we have relied on numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted that the recent advances made on the integrability and solution of the rabi model provide additional analytical tools and allow the simulation of very large system using reasonable computational resources @xcite .",
    "these new tools might be useful for treating problems similar to the ones considered here .",
    "for example , the new techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite could make it possible to analyze the case of slow - passage lzs interferometry , which would correspond to very small values of @xmath115 and is therefore challenging for us to treat using our numerical approach",
    ".    as there is continuing effort to increase the coupling strength in cavity - qed systems with remarkable recent progress and as driving quantum systems with oscillating fields is one of the main tools of quantum control , we expect that the present study combining these two important problems will be relevant to future studies that push the limits of landau - zener - stueckelberg interferometry and cavity qed .",

    "<S> we analyze the dynamics of a two - level quantum system ( tls ) under the influence of a strong sinusoidal driving signal whose origin is the interaction of the two - level system with a quantum field . in this approach the driving field </S>",
    "<S> is replaced by a harmonic oscillator that is either strongly coupled to the tls or populated with a large number of photons . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the rabi model , we derive expressions for the tls s oscillation frequencies and compare the results with those obtained from the model where the driving signal is treated classically . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the limits of weak coupling and large photon number , the well - known expression for the rabi frequency in the strong driving regime is recovered . in the opposite limit of strong coupling and small photon number </S>",
    "<S> , we find differences between the predictions of the semiclassical and quantum models . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the quantum picture can therefore be understood as landau - zener - stueckelberg interferometry in the fully quantum regime . </S>"
