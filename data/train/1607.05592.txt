    "inspired by the old idea of dirac and zeldovich @xcite that monopoles are not seen because they are hidden by their strong magnetic forces forming a bound state called monopolium we proposed some time ago , that due to its bound state structure , monopolium might be easier to detect than free monopoles @xcite .",
    "some years ago @xcite , we stated that the large hadron collider was an ideal machine to discover monopolium and monopole - antimonopole pairs with monopole masses below @xmath3 .",
    "we proposed the observability of monopoles and monopolium in the @xmath1 channel for monopole masses in the range @xmath4 at present running energies and for an integrated luminosity of @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the interpretation of the recent @xmath0 enhancement in the inclusive @xmath1- spectrum at @xmath6 reported by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations as a possible monopolium state decaying into its natural diphoton final state .",
    "in here we are going to revisit the previously mentioned reference adjusting the monopole mass and the binding energy to reproduce the announced experimental scenario .    due to the large monopole - photon coupling",
    "there is no well defined field theory able to describe the coupling of photons to monopoles .",
    "two schemes have been used thus far : the original dirac coupling @xcite and the @xmath7-coupling @xcite . in the former the coupling",
    "is described directly by @xmath8 the magnetic charge of the monopole . in the latter the coupling",
    "is given by @xmath9 , where @xmath7 is the velocity of the monopoles or monopolium in the two photon center of mass system depending on the process.the dirac scheme has the largest possible coupling at threshold , while the @xmath7-coupling has the smallest coupling at threshold , namely there it vanishes . in our dual qed theory monopolium can decay not only by @xmath10 but also by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 sizeably because the coupling is strong .",
    "we will parametrize these other decays by a branching ratio to @xmath14 which we obtain from the lhc data analysis @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss monopolium decay in the two schemes .",
    "one immediate consequence of the existence of monopolium is that also monopole - antimonopole can annihilate from their mass threshold onward .",
    "this process is studied in section iii .",
    "finally some conclusions of our analysis are drawn in section iv .",
    "the calculation follows the procedure and approximations developed in ref.@xcite with minor changes . the mechanism proposed to produce monopolium is photon fusion @xcite .",
    "we consider all possible processes , namely elastic , semielastic and inelastic . the elementary cross section to be plugged in the formalism of p - p collisions @xcite",
    "is given by    @xmath15    here @xmath16 is the monopolium mass , @xmath17 the center of mass energy of the subsystem @xmath18 with on shell photons as in the weizscker - williams approximation @xcite . in the breit - wigner approximation",
    "we take @xmath19 , gev and the branching fraction to 2 photons we take of a few percent @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath20 subsume the structure of our proposed intermediate bound state and is given by @xcite    @xmath21    here , @xmath22 is the fine structure constant , @xmath23 is the monopole mass and @xmath24 a scheme dependent factor : @xmath25 in the dirac scheme and the monopolium velocity @xmath26 in the @xmath7-scheme .",
    "the details of the calculation of @xmath20 are described in our previous work @xcite , to which we have incorporated the energy dependence @xcite in the required weizscker - williams approximation . introducing these elementary expressions in the p - p scattering formalism developed for this problem one",
    "obtains    @xmath27    where @xmath17 is the center of mass energy of the subsystem and @xmath28 is the center of mass energy squared of the p - p system .",
    "the last factor following the notation of ref.@xcite for the inelastic channel is given by @xmath29 after having performed the change of variables @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and having used @xmath34 .",
    "analogouss expressions for the semielastic and elastic channels can be obtained by a similar change of variables . in this way",
    "the elementary cross section appears always separated from the convolution integrals .",
    "[ ptb ]    diracvsbeta.eps    we proceed to calculate the cross - section , namely the sum of the three contributions elastic , semielastic and inelastic , as a function of monopole and monopolium masses for the two schemes .",
    "we perform the calculation for a total center of mass energy of 8 and 13 tev and fix our parameters @xmath16 and @xmath23 such that their values lead to a possible resonant behavior at @xmath35 gev using @xmath36 gev and @xmath37gev .",
    "the total width and the branching ratio are crucial to determine the precise value of the cross section . a larger width and",
    "a smaller branching ratio would diminish the cross section for fixed monopole mass .",
    "we show in fig.[diracvsbeta ] the cross section for both schemes as a function of binding energy for a total p - p center of mass energy of @xmath38 tev . fixing the enhancement at @xmath39 and limiting the cross section to be below @xmath40",
    "fb / gev leads in the dirac scheme to strong monopole mass and binding energy restrictions , namely binding energies can only go up to @xmath41gev and monopole masses have to be below @xmath42 .",
    "these restrictions imply that the monopole - antimonopole threshold is very close to monopolium and moreover for such a small mass , as will be shown in the next section , even if the monopolium peak is undetectable at @xmath43 tev , the monopole - antimonopole annihilation cross section will appear at these energies as a clearly detectable rise of the background .",
    "the fact that no such rise has been observed in the first lhc run at these energies implies that the @xmath44 gev enhancement can not be due to monopoles if the conventional dirac scheme is the one chosen by nature .",
    "we assume that that is not the case and proceed to analyze the results in the @xmath7 scheme from now on .    in fig",
    "[ 13 - 8 ] we plot the cross section as a function of monopole mass for @xmath43 and @xmath38 tev showing that the @xmath7-coupling is less restricted by the enhancement conditions and therefore the possible monopole masses can reach higher values ( @xmath45gev ) . in this case",
    "the binding energy can be larger reaching values of up to @xmath46gev at the highest cross sections .",
    "this result is very appealing because it implies that above the suspected enhancement , monopole - antimonopole pairs should be detected in the two photon channel .",
    "the @xmath43 tev result is about 5 times smaller that the @xmath38 tev result in the mass range considered a result which is consistent with the absence of events in the previous lhc run .",
    "[ ptb ]    13-8.eps    in fig .",
    "[ monopolium ] we show the resonance peak for several monopole masses and fixed monopolium mass at @xmath47 gev .",
    "increasing the binding energy increases the cross section .",
    "therefore the peak can be made as as small as desired by diminishing the binding energy . however , as will be shown in the next section , diminishing the mass of the monopole increases the @xmath48 annihilation cross section and moreover makes the annihilation bump approach the monopolium peak . the same argument to discard dirac coupling",
    "could be applied to disregard very small monopolium peaks .",
    "[ ptb ]    monopolium.eps    we analyze in the next section the onset on monopole - antimonopole annihilations and see that low expectations for these restrict further the monopole mass .",
    "it is natural to think that the enormous strength and long range of the monopole interaction leads to the annihilation of the pair into photons very close to the production point .",
    "thus one should look for monopoles through their annihilation into highly energetic photons , a channel for which lhc detectors have been optimized .    in order to calculate the annihilation into photons",
    "we assume that our effective theory , a technically convenient modification of ginzburg and schiller s , agrees with qed at one loop order with a @xmath7 coupling .",
    "therefore we apply light - by - light scattering with the appropriate modifications as shown in fig .",
    "[ mmannihilation ] and discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it became clear there that close to threshold the cross section is quite isotropic and away from threshold the forward cross section , which is very difficult to measure , is larger than the right - angle one .",
    "since the detectors can not detect all of the photons coming out , we take the right - angle cross section as a conservative indication of the magnitudes to be expected .",
    "we analyze the appearence of monopole - antimonopole after the monopolium enhancement following the steps of our previous work @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mm380 - 390 ] we show the annihilation cross section for two different masses .",
    "the cross section diminishes with increasing monopole mass .",
    "the maximum of the cross - section will occur far away from the threshold when @xmath7 approaches unity but it will be well below the @xmath8-coupling values since the energy denominator has already killed the maximum of the @xmath8-coupling strength when this happens . in any case , the results far away from threshold , must be taken with a grain of salt since our approximations might start to fail and moreover the angular dependence , not considered here , becomes important .",
    "[ ptb ]    it must be recalled that by keeping the monopolium mass fixed increasing the binding is equivalent to increasing the monopole mass .",
    "thus monopolium annihilation and monopole - antimonopole annihilation cross sections vary in opposite way as shown ing fig [ change ] .",
    "this tightens the fixing of the monopole mass since a mass which leads to a small monopolium annihilation cross section will lead to a large monopole - antimonopole cross section and viceversa .",
    "once the mass of the monopole is fixed the annihilation cross section is fixed , there is no additional freedom in the model used .",
    "[ ptb ]    change1.eps    in fig [ fulldetail ] we show the result of our calculation for a @xmath49 gev mass monopole with a @xmath47 gev mass monopolium in the @xmath7-coupling scheme . due to",
    "the momentum dependent @xmath7-coupling the bump of the resonance is displaced by @xmath50 gev from its mass .",
    "the 2 @xmath51 annihilation signal above monopole - antimonopole threshold rises slowly and is a very broad bump , whose maximum cross section is in this case about @xmath40 fm / gev .",
    "smaller monopole masses and smaller binding energies lead to smaller cross sections for monopolium , while on the contrary for smaller masses the cross section for @xmath48 annihilation is bigger , as shown before .",
    "this different behavior is associated to the binding energy of monopolium .",
    "we have analyzed in this paper the possibility that the @xmath44 gev enhancement could be a monopolium state . in order to have that possibility the mass of the monopole has to be low by conventional standards @xmath52",
    "gev . this low mass leads to the immediate conclusion that a monopole with dirac coupling can not be the origin of the enhancement .",
    "we have therefore limited our discussion to the so called @xmath7 coupling scheme . in the @xmath7 scheme the small width to @xmath14 allows for a way out of the mass slavery .",
    "for a two photon branching ratio of a few percent , in agreement with most analysis @xcite , we obtain a cross sections below @xmath40 fm / gev signalling a monopolium state at @xmath53 gev .    [ ptb ]    fulldetail.eps",
    "the most recent analysis @xcite tend to lower the expectation on the 2 @xmath54 enhancement . if this were so",
    ", the lesson to be learned from our analysis is that the existence of a monopolium state implies automatically a threshold for monopole - antimonopole production relatively close by .",
    "therefore this monopolium peak should be accompanied by a @xmath48 broad bump .",
    "the existence of the latter puts additional restrictions on the model parameters due to the magnitude of the annihilation cross section . in the present case in order to keep both cross sections low , the monopole mass must be in the range @xmath55 gev .",
    "lower cross section to the ones shown in this paper for these low masses can only be achieved by increasing the total decay width above @xmath56 gev , and/or reducing the 2 @xmath51 branching ratio even more .",
    "this mechanism would automatically reduce the monopolium cross section , would allow for larger binding energies and larger monopole masses , and thus would diminish the @xmath48 annihilation cross section furthermore .",
    "a monopole scenario for the @xmath44 gev enhancement leads to a double bump , the lower can be a narrow peak associated with monopolium while the higher is a broad bump associated to @xmath48 annihilation into photons .",
    "such a structure will always arise for low mass monopoles ( @xmath57 gev ) .",
    "for higher mass monopoles the bumps will broaden and the possibility of them merging together is high for reasonable binding energies , thus in that case one broad bump should be the most common feature @xcite .    waiting expectantly for the data of the last lhc run",
    "we might conclude that a @xmath44 gev enhancement followed by a soft rising background would be a plausible signal for monopole discovery .    after the completion of this paper we became aware of a non - perturbative lattice gauge theory calculation of monopolium and its eventual correlation with the @xmath44 gev enhancement @xcite .",
