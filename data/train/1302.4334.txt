    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) was an all - sky mid - infrared mission @xcite , that operated in wavebands having effective wavelengths @xmath0 and 22 .",
    "it commenced its survey on 2010 january 14 , completed its all - sky survey on 2010 july 17 , and the mission terminated on 2011 february 1 .",
    "in the course of its survey , wise detected a number of classical and recurrent novae and we have trawled through the wise archive for galactic novae .",
    "classical novae are well - known to go through a nebular ( and in some cases , coronal ) phase when emission lines dominate the spectrum .",
    "many of these lines , which are known to be strong in mature novae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , fall in the wise bandpasses ; for example , neon lines  which are strongest in novae that originate on one white dwarfs  affect wise bands  1 , 3 and  4 . as discussed by @xcite , infrared fine - structure lines can remain strong for many decades after the nova outburst .",
    "also , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath1% of novae ( and generally those that arise on co white dwarfs ) are dust formers .",
    "the mineralogy of the dust is varied , with carbon , silicates and hydrocarbon commonly seen .",
    "the dust temperature late in the evolution is typically several 100s of k , placing its emission in the wise filters .",
    "we have data - mined the wise archive for classical and recurrent novae , including mature and recent novae , and novae that have erupted since the wise mission .",
    "we present here the preliminary results of this trawl , and we concentrate on a selection of objects with @xmath2 detections in all four wise bands .",
    "in fig .  [ rne ] we show the wise spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of t  crb and rs  oph , two recurrent novae with giant secondaries ; we have fitted the data with black body curves having temperatures corresponding to the spectral types of the secondaries . in the case of t",
    "crb , the wise data are consistent with the rayleigh - jeans tail of the secondary , with no evidence for excess emission .",
    "however in the case of rs  oph there is clearly an excess in wise bands  3 and  4 , which we attribute to the dust known to be present in the system @xcite . during its recurrent nova eruptions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) there is evidence that the ejected material interacts strongly with the giant secondary wind and the binary environment @xcite .",
    "there seems to be little evidence for circumstellar material in the environment of t  crb and it will be interesting to see ( when its long - awaited eruption occurs ! ) the extent to which the sequence of events that occurred during the eruption of rs  oph is replicated in t  crb .      in fig .",
    "[ emission ] we show the wise seds of v705  cas ( 1993 ) and v382  vel ( 1999 ) .",
    "the former was a dust - forming nova , the eruption occurring on the surface of a co white dwarf .",
    "there is clearly a large excess in wise band  4 in the sed of v705  cas , which is very likely due to emission by the [ o ] fine - structure line at 25.89  and which is ubiquitous in mature novae .",
    "this line was present in v705  cas in 1996 , when it was observed with the  @xcite , although it was weak when it was observed by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite ; the  irs spectrum in the region of the [ o ] line is shown in fig .",
    "[ emission ] .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ emission ] is the decline in the peak flux in the [ o ] line in v705  cas over the period 1996 ( )  2007 ( wise ) . in a comprehensive study of the evolution of the line emission of dq  her ( 1934 ) , @xcite estimated the evolution of the strengths of a number of recombination and fine - structure lines for @xmath3  years after eruption . with the caveat that this analysis was for the specific case of dq  her , its stellar remnant and ejecta abundances ,",
    "the predicted evolution of the [ o ] fins structure line is in surprisingly good ( qualitative ) agreement with the evolution of the [ o ] line in v705  cas .",
    "v382  vel , on the other hand , was an one nova @xcite which displayed strong neon lines @xcite .",
    "the wise sed for this object shows a strong excess in bands  3 and  4 .",
    "the wise data are superficially consistent with the presence of strong fine - structure and coronal lines , specifically [ ne ] 12.8 , [ ne ] 14.3  and [ ne ] 15.55  in band  3 , and [ ne ] 24.32 , [ o ] 25.89  in band  4 ; all these lines were present in  spectra of v382  vel @xcite .",
    "further modelling is necessary to verify this and this is in progress .      in fig .",
    "[ dust ] we show the wise seds of dz  cru ( 2003 ) and v1280  sco ( 2007 ) , both of which were prolific dust - producers , and both of which were observed by .",
    "[ dust ] includes the  data for dz  cru from @xcite ; these data were fitted with dusty @xcite using amorphous carbon at @xmath4  k. the wise data show that the dust emission is shifting to longer wavelengths and declining in flux as the dust disperses .",
    "we have attempted to fit the wise data for dz  cru with dusty .",
    "a constraint is that the inner radius of the dust shell when dz  cru was observed by wise ( day  2351 ) might be expected to be related to that in 2007 ( day  874 ) when dz  cru was observed by , for example by the assumption of uniform outflow ; the resulting dust temperature is @xmath5  k , although the fit is not entirely satisfactory ( see fig .",
    "[ dust ] ) .",
    "the dust shell around v1280  sco was observed at high spatial resolution by @xcite , who found that the dust resides in a bipolar configuration .",
    "the wise data suggest that the dust temperature at the inner edge of the shell was @xmath6  k in 2010 ( see fig .",
    "[ dust ] ) .      in fig .",
    "[ post - wise ] we show the wise seds of the recurrent t  pyx and nova sgr 2012b .",
    "the sed of t  pyx during the 2011 eruption is shown in fig .",
    "[ post - wise ] ( top right ) .",
    "data from the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "@xcite show excess emission longward of 50 , which @xcite attributed to interstellar dust that had been swept up by a wind ( either permanent , from the binary , or from nova eruptions ) from the t  pyx binary .",
    "the wise data for t  pyx suggest an excess at 22 .",
    "further work is needed to establish whether the same material is responsible for the excess pre- and post - wise .",
    "the wise sed of nova sgr 2012b is also shown in fig .",
    "[ post - wise ] , in which the wise data have been supplemented by data from _ 2mass , msx _ and _ iras _ ; we see strong emission which peaks at @xmath7 .",
    "this is consistent with optical spectroscopy of this nova , which reveals a symbiotic - like system ( f. m. walter , private communication ) .",
    "while the wise survey does not have the broad wavelength coverage of the _ iras _ survey it has vastly superior sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "it will surely be as valuable a resource for investigating the circumstellar environment of novae as was _ iras _ some 30  years ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover it has the potential to provide unprecedented information about nova _",
