    "the process of coagulation or aggregation is responsible for the coarsening of a size distribution of particles suspended in gaseous or liquid media .",
    "in essence the phenomenon consists of a sequence of statistically independent events where two ( or possibly more ) particles unite , perhaps as a result of collision , to create a composite particle , and each event reduces the number of particles in the system @xcite .",
    "this has further consequences such as colloidal precipitation or accelerated rainfall from clouds @xcite .",
    "fragmentation can be present as well @xcite , but precipitation processes are typically dominated by irreversible agglomeration .",
    "the phenomenon is familiar and yet it can present some surprises , an example of which was presented by lushnikov @xcite in an exact study of coagulation kinetics driven by various choices of aggregation rates . in the later stages of a process where the binary coagulation rate is proportional to the product of the masses of the participants , for example ,",
    "a single particle emerges with a mass representing a sizable fraction of that of the entire system @xcite .",
    "this has been termed a gelation event and standard kinetic models of coagulation are unable to account for the phenomenon , for the simple reason that they are designed to describe systems consisting of very large populations of particles in each size class .",
    "they rely on a so - called mean field approximation , though this is not always clearly recognised .",
    "when small particle populations play a key role in the kinetics , different approaches become necessary @xcite , the most common being monte carlo modelling @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates the utility of a rate equation model of kinetic processes that is able to capture small population effects .",
    "the markovian master equations that describe coagulation may be transformed mathematically into a problem in the dynamics of continuous stochastic variables acted upon by complex noise .",
    "the solutions to the transformed dynamics may be related to the evolving statistical properties of the populations in the physical system .",
    "the recasting of the problem into one that concerns complex ` pseudo - populations ' can be done in two distinct ways , either using methods of operator algebra similar to those employed in quantum field theories @xcite , or through the so - called poisson representation of the populations @xcite .",
    "the physical problem concerning the stochastic evolution of a set of ( integer - valued ) populations is replaced by the task of solving and averaging a set of stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such a transformation over monte carlo simulation of the process @xcite emerges for cases where the particles come in many species or sizes , since the configuration space of the populations , and hence the computational cost increases very rapidly , but in order to illustrate the approach we study a very simple example of coagulation , where the aggregation rates do not depend on the masses of the participants .",
    "this is very different from the cases that exhibit gelation , studied by lushnikov and others , and we might not expect major deviations from a mean field approach , but nevertheless it is possible to demonstrate the analytic procedure , and compare the accuracy of numerical pseudo - population dynamics and averaging with respect to other approaches @xcite , in order to form a view on the usefulness of the approach .    in section [ sec :",
    "analytic - model - of ] the master equations describing the basic problem of @xmath0 aggregation are developed and then the poisson representation is introduced and used to derive the equivalent stochastic dynamics problem and associated averaging scheme . the exact solution for the evolving complex pseudo - population",
    "is obtained and its properties established . in section [ sec : numerical - approach . ] a parallel numerical study of the stochastic problem is discussed .",
    "inherent instabilities in the dynamics may be eliminated using the cameron - martin - girsanov formula , or equivalently through a so - called gauge transformation introduced by drummond @xcite .",
    "however , this comes with the introduction of diffusive dynamics for a subsidiary variable that for extended evolution times would seem to require high computational cost for accuracy . nevertheless , with a certain choice of transformation , termed an optimised gauge",
    ", we can ensure that the coagulation process is completed before this diffusive noise becomes apparent .",
    "we comment on the procedures and prospects for their further use in more complicated models in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a population of particles of a species @xmath1 undergoing binary coagulation @xmath2 .",
    "the distinction between particles of different mass is ignored and the rate at which aggregation events takes place is a constant , making this one of the simplest cases to study .",
    "the evolution of @xmath3 , the probability at time @xmath4 that @xmath5 particles remain , is described by a set of master equations of the form @xmath6 the first term corresponds to the rate of gain in the probability of observing population @xmath5 as a result of an aggregation event in circumstances where there are @xmath7 particles , properly weighted by the number of particle pairs in such an initial state and the probability @xmath8 of an event per unit time and per pair .",
    "the second term corresponds to the rate of loss of probability due to aggregation starting from a population equal to @xmath5 . multiplying the master equations by @xmath5 and summing over @xmath5",
    "it can be shown that @xmath9 where statistical averages are written @xmath10 .",
    "if we take the view that @xmath11 , which corresponds to the neglect of fluctuations in population ( which is why the procedure is called a mean field approximation ) , and consider a large mean population @xmath12 , such that only the first term on the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ eq:101 ] ) is retained , we can write @xmath13 and this can be integrated to give @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial mean population .",
    "this is the classical smoluchowski solution to this type of coagulation kinetics @xcite .    if the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:101 ] ) is retained , but again neglecting fluctuations , then the integration yields @xmath16 which ought to be more accurate than eq .",
    "( [ eq:102 ] ) , especially in the limit @xmath17 when it goes to unity rather than zero .    rather than making the mean field approximation @xmath18",
    ", we could generate an evolution equation for @xmath19 by multiplying the master equation by @xmath20 and summing , namely @xmath21 but now the third moment appears on the right hand side .",
    "an equation for the evolution of this moment would involve the fourth moment : this is a hierarchy problem that often arises in kinetic theory",
    ". a closure condition such as @xmath22 could be imposed , but the accuracy of such assumptions is questionable .",
    "similarly , the numerous master equations for the @xmath23 in a more general model where there are different categories of species @xmath24 with populations @xmath25 would reduce under a mean field approximation to @xmath26 where the coefficients @xmath27 quantify the rate of aggregation of the form @xmath28 between species @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath29 representing species mass , for example . if we should need a treatment beyond the mean field approximation , then for relatively simple stochastic processes we could use monte carlo simulations to extract the relevant statistical properties , but for more complex coagulation problems the use of this technique can become computationally expensive .    the transformation of the problem we wish to investigate is of interest since it reduces the master equations to the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:101 ] ) and more generally eq .",
    "( [ eq:105 ] ) , but supplemented by a noise term on the right hand side .",
    "this is not the same as inserting noise to represent a random source term in the population dynamics , nor is it an additional representation of stochasticity in the coagulation kinetics .",
    "it is a noise term that creates the statistical correlations in the populations that are neglected when the mean field approximation is taken .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of simple binary coagulation may be modelled by a pseudo - population @xmath31 that evolves according to the equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a noise with certain statistical properties .",
    "this may be compared with eq .",
    "( [ eq:101a ] ) .",
    "the notable aspect of this representation is that the noise is complex , such that the variable @xmath31 is generally complex as well .",

    "( [ eq:106 ] ) can be a simpler task than that posed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:100 ] ) .",
    "we next describe how this transformation may be achieved .",
    "gardiner and chaturvedi @xcite _ _ outlined a method for transforming master equations into a fokker - planck equation by representing probability distributions as integrals of weighted complex poisson distributions .",
    "the probability of finding @xmath5 particles at time @xmath4 may be written @xmath34 this is a superposition of poisson distributions , over a closed contour of complex mean values @xmath31 , with an evolving weighting function @xmath35 which has initial value @xmath36 such that if the contour @xmath37 includes the origin , the initial condition @xmath38 is recovered from eq .",

    "but since a stochastic problem described by a fokker - planck equation such as ( [ eq:111 ] ) can be recast as one involving a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) , the properties of the distribution @xmath35 can be reconstructed by solving @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an increment in a wiener process with properties @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the brackets representing an average over the noise .",

    "if we wish to study the evolution of clusters of monomers that have size dependent agglomeration properties , then each size must be treated as a distinct species .",

    "nevertheless , the task is linear in @xmath310 and must eventually become more efficient than direct solution to the master equations for large enough @xmath310 .",
    "it is only when the mean of a population becomes small that deviations from mean field behaviour emerge , and so a hybrid approach might be possible whereby mean field rate equations are used to model the early stages of coagulation , going over to pseudo - population rate equations when the mean population becomes small .",

    "we now define a quantity @xmath253 through the relation @xmath370 such that @xmath371 and using ito s lemma , we show that @xmath253 evolves according to @xmath372 we see from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:303]-[eq:307 ] ) that averages of the increment @xmath343 over differently distributed random increments can be related to one another , and that the quantity @xmath261 describes the connection .",
    "in order for this to make sense mathematically , two conditions must be met .",
    "the first is that no process that has non - zero probability under @xmath352 should be impossible under @xmath350 , and vice versa .",
    "the second , known as novikov s condition , requires that @xmath373 .",
    "we now invert the point of view , and instead of considering a single variable treated according to two different averaging procedures , we relate the evolution of two different variables under the same averaging .",
    "explicitly , we consider variable @xmath66 evolving as @xmath374 and another variable @xmath375 that evolves according to @xmath376 , with @xmath377 .",
    "the above results imply that we can write @xmath378 which resembles a combination of eqs .",

    "we shall demonstrate its validity shortly .",
    "note that there is no need to indicate the probability measure on the brackets , or further label the increment @xmath48 , since here it is a standard wiener increment with zero mean in the probability distribution under consideration .",
    "the inserted factor accounts for the difference in drift in the evolution of @xmath66 and @xmath375 and may also be written @xmath379 with @xmath380 or equivalently @xmath381 .",
    "now consider the following : @xmath387 where we use a discrete representation of the time integration .",
    "we have recognised that if @xmath388 then @xmath389 such that by repetition of this step , the expression reduces to @xmath390dx_{j}^{\\prime}\\right\\rangle $ ] .",
    "now , since @xmath391 we can write @xmath392 and with the insertion of @xmath376 , we conclude that @xmath393 such that @xmath394 and since @xmath395 this means that @xmath396 thus we have shown that if we wish to evaluate the quantity @xmath397 generated by sde @xmath374 , we could instead solve the sdes @xmath398 with initial conditions @xmath399 , @xmath249 , and with the function @xmath400 taking arbitrary form subject to novikov s condition , and then use the results to evaluate the equivalent quantity @xmath401 . clearly , this is identical to drummond s gauging scheme .",
