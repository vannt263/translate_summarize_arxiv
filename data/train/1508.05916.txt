    "numerical lattice qcd simulations naturally determine dimensionless quantities such as mass ratios and matrix element ratios , however determining a physical value requires the introduction of a scale , usually taken from experiment .",
    "a hadron mass , such as the proton mass , or decay constant , such as the pion decay constant , are often used for this purpose . we discuss here setting the scale using flavour - singlet quantities , which in conjunction with simulations keeping the average quark mass constant allow @xmath4 flavour breaking expansions to be used .",
    "this is illustrated here using @xmath2 clover fermions , and a determination of the wilson flow scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given .",
    "these are ` secondary ' scales and are not experimentally accessible and thus they have to be matched to physical quantities .",
    "these flow scales are cheap to compute from lattice simulations ( for example they do not require a knowledge of quark propagators ) and accurate ( for example they do not require a determination of the potential which requires the limit of a large distance ) .",
    "so once the phenomenological value of the flow scales is known the determination of physical values becomes more tractable .",
    "flow and flow variables were introduced by lscher , @xcite .",
    "we follow him here , @xcite , in particular in our brief discussion of the @xmath0 scale .",
    "flow represents a smoothing of the gauge fields .",

    "setting @xmath11 then we define the @xmath0 scale by @xmath12 alternatively , @xcite define the @xmath1 scale as @xmath13 where in both definitions @xmath14 is a constant , conventionally taken as @xmath15 .",
    "we require a value of @xmath14 such that @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the lattice size and this value was found to be a suitable choice , @xcite .",
    "alternative suggestions have been made , see e.g.   @xcite .    in this article",
    "we shall give a determination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "we describe our method of approaching the physical quark mass starting from a point on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line , @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the general property of singlet quantities , that they have a stationary point about this @xmath4 flavour symmetric line .",
    "section  [ singlet_quant ] gives examples of singlet quantities both hadronic and gluonic ( i.e.  in this case @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and also discusses their @xmath4 flavour breaking expansions .",
    "section  [ latt_matt ] first gives our lattice conventions , ensembles used and numerical values of the singlet quantities .",
    "this is followed by section  [ scale_set ] in which the @xmath24 and @xmath1 scales are determined for several lattice spacings . in the next section ,",
    "section  [ cont_res ] we take the continuum result to give the final result . finally in section  [ concl ]",
    "we compare our result with other results for @xmath22 flavours and give our conclusions .",
    "we consider extrapolations to the physical point from a point on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line keeping the average quark mass fixed , @xcite , @xmath25 this means that as the pion mass tends downwards to its physical value , the kaon mass increases upwards to its physical value .",

    "note also that for the wilson flow singlets we consider the inverse of the flow variable as then all singlet quantities have the same dimensions .",
    "other possibilities , as discussed in @xcite include the further nucleon octet singlet @xmath48 and baryon decuplet singlets @xmath49 further possibilities can be constructed from ` fictitious ' particles , such as a ` nucleon ' , @xmath50 , with three mass degenerate quarks at the strange quark mass . at the @xmath4 flavour symmetric points , all the baryon octet hadrons are mass degenerate ( at least from a qcd perspective ) , so we expect that away from this point there is no ( or very little ) difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 , i.e.  @xmath53 .",
