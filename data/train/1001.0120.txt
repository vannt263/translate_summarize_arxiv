    "the neutrino rest mass is a very important parameter for cosmology , astrophysics , and the standard model of elementary particles .",
    "the existence of neutrinos , already postulated by pauli and put into a mathematical framework of @xmath0 decay by fermi @xcite long time ago , was verified by reines and cowan in 1956 @xcite . however , despite the high solar neutrinos flux of about billions per @xmath3 on earth the answer to the question about their rest mass is one of the big unknowns in physics .",
    "since neutrino - flavor oscillations have been observed in the late nineties at the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite a non - vanishing neutrino rest mass has to be expected .",
    "unfortunately , this type of experiments reveals only mass differences between neutrino flavors .",
    "the presently constructed katrin ( karlsruhe tritium neutrino - mass ) experiment with an expected sensitivity of about @xmath4 @xmath5 should have the ability to determine the absolute value for one of the flavors or at least a new upper limit to it @xcite .",
    "this so called next - generation tritium @xmath0-decay experiment is only based on kinematic relations and energy and momentum conservation .",
    "thus katrin provides a model - independent direct measurement of the antineutrino rest mass @xmath6 ( more accurately the mass of the antineutrino in a given mass - flavor mixture mostly attributed to the electronic neutrino ) . in more detail , @xmath7 will be extracted in a fit procedure from the shape of the @xmath0 spectrum . besides the precise measurement of the @xmath0-electron energy spectrum it is crucial for the mass extraction to know how the @xmath0 spectrum is modified by the final - state spectrum of the decay product . as in the previous most recent tritium neutrino - mass experiments in mainz and troitsk the @xmath8 molecule is chosen as tritium source .",
    "@xmath8 comprises a compromise between experimental accessibility and theoretical treatability .",
    "the final - state spectrum of its decay product @xmath9 was therefore subject of a number of very detailed calculations @xcite , finally accumulating in the one covering the whole energy regime @xcite .",
    "recently , the spectrum was further adapted to specific needs ( isotope distribution and temperature ) of the katrin experiment @xcite .",
    "although a high purity of the molecular tritium source is expected for katrin , the produced @xmath0 electrons can interact with other gas molecules and thus produce tritium species different from @xmath8 .",
    "one of the expected processes is the dissociative attachment @xmath10 where @xmath1 formation occurs . despite the relative small cross section compared to , e.g. , the one for vibrational excitation of the @xmath8 molecule",
    ", this process is very important .",
    "the reason is the higher endpoint energy of the @xmath0 spectrum for the decay of @xmath1 compared to the one of @xmath8 . due to",
    "this fact the occurrence of @xmath1 ions leads to a systematical error and hence to a possible limitation of the sensitivity of katrin , if it is not properly accounted for @xcite .    to the authors knowledge , there exist so far only two theoretical predictions for the final - state spectrum following @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 .",
    "however , in @xcite only transition probabilities to 4 final states are reported .",
    "furthermore , the results in @xcite disagree substantially from the ones given in an earlier work @xcite that was , however , also limited to 10 final states .",
    "the aim of this work was thus to provide a complete final - state spectrum for the decay process @xmath11 and to shed some light on the disagreeing earlier results .",
    "the calculation of the non - relativistic eigenstates of the atomic systems is performed within the approximation of an infinitely heavy mass of the nuclei , i.e.  @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this is justifiable due to the large mass difference of the nucleus and the electrons .",
    "the calculation of the final - state spectrum can be performed analytically for _ neutral _ t atoms and reveals a negligible mass dependence .",
    "hence a large mass dependence is also not expected in the case of tritium anions .",
    "the non - relativistic hamiltonian for the two - electron system has the form ( atomic units with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 are used throughout , if not specified otherwise ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the charge of the nucleus and @xmath19 the position vector of the @xmath20th electron .",
    "due to the fact that the only bound state of @xmath1 is a singlet state with angular momentum @xmath21 @xcite , only symmetric spatial configuration state functions ( csf ) are important , @xmath22 to determine the eigenstates and corresponding energy eigenvalues a simple expansion in slater - type orbitals ( sto ) is used , @xmath23 the @xmath24 are integer parameters with limitations analogously to the ones for the hydrogen quantum numbers and the @xmath25 represent the spherical harmonics .",
    "the @xmath26 are positive real parameters .",
    "an appropriate choice of these parameters allows for the achievement of an in principle complete coverage of the hilbert space of the one - particle part of hamiltonian . in the full configuration - interaction ( ci )",
    "method the eigenstates are expressed as a linear superposition of all possible symmetry - adapted csfs @xmath27 that can be formed with the aid of the chosen sto basis .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath28 are determined by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem obtained from inserting the wavefunction _",
    "ansatz _ of eq . into the eigenvalue equation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the final - state spectrum of @xmath29 is calculated within the sudden approximation @xcite that is based on the fact that the escaping @xmath0 electron has a much higher velocity than the bound electrons . in the analysis of tritium neutrino - mass experiments like katrin only the @xmath0 electrons with an energy near the endpoint of the @xmath0 spectrum at @xmath30 are used .",
    "their velocity is clearly much larger than the average speed of the bound electrons in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the validity of the sudden approximation has been demonstrated for t@xmath31 in @xcite where the first - order correction terms were derived and explicitly calculated . from those results it is apparent",
    "that also for @xmath1 the sudden approximation is expected to be valid within the accuracy required for the analysis of an experiment like katrin .",
    "nevertheless a brief discussion of possible effects beyond the sudden approximation on the final - state spectrum is given at the end of this work .",
    "a basis set of 555 stos yielding 3481 csfs in the full ci calculation was used to obtain the final results shown in this work .",
    "this sto basis set contains all possible kinds of orbitals ( with restrictions on @xmath32 and @xmath33 as mentioned above ) up to the angular quantum number @xmath34 . for the optimization of the parameters",
    "@xmath26 a genetic and several other algorithms @xcite were tested . however , none of those algorithms lead to completely convincing results .",
    "therefore , the parameters were finally optimized by hand .",
    "the difficulty of the parameter optimization is due to the requirement to construct a basis set with high coverage of the hilbert space while avoiding inaccuracies due to numerically caused linear dependencies . with the aim to achieve a uniform description of the possible @xmath29 final states it is favorable to obtain a homogeneous and a high density of states in the continuum as well as a large number of bound states .",
    "if a large number of cfss is used , the optimization of the individual @xmath26 values becomes less important , since the full ci method leads to a sufficient mixing of the hilbert space covered by the various stos .",
    "therefore , the parameters @xmath26 were chosen to start in an interval between 2 and 3 and to decrease in value for increasing @xmath35 ( for a given @xmath32 ) .",
    "this procedure avoids numerical problems and allows the construction of a huge , but linearly independent basis set .",
    "this basis set is used for both the ground state of @xmath1 and all final states of @xmath29 .",
    "the chosen basis leads for @xmath1 to the ground - state energy @xmath36 that is only @xmath37 above the very accurate values in @xcite . in the case of @xmath29 the adopted basis set yields 16 states below the ionization continuum .",
    "out of those 16 states 15 are identified as true physical states , while the 16th state is a pseudo state that resembles the remaining infinite number of rydberg states as a consequence that a finite basis set is adopted .    within the sudden approximation the transition probability for @xmath1 decays into bound states of @xmath29 is simply given by the squared overlap @xmath38 of the initial state @xmath39 , i.e. the @xmath1 ground state , and the final state @xmath40 , i.e. the n - th bound state of @xmath29 .",
    ".[tab : disp ] population probabilities @xmath41 of the @xmath42 bound states of helium after the @xmath0 decay of a @xmath1 anion .",
    "also given are the corresponding energies @xmath43 ( in atomic units ) obtained in the present work . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to calculate the transition - probability density into continuum states the complex scaling method is used .",
    "it is based on the mathematical development by aguilar , balslev , and combes @xcite as well as simon @xcite .",
    "the application of this method leads in practice to a simple but powerful modification of the hamiltonian @xmath44 in eq .",
    ", @xmath45 in eq .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the usual kinetic and potential energy operators of he , respectively .",
    "the complex - scaling angle @xmath48 can in principle be chosen arbitrarily within @xmath49 . in the limit of an infinite basis",
    "all observables calculated with the aid of complex scaling should become independent of @xmath48 .",
    "since only finite basis sets can be applied in practice , only approximate eigenstates can be obtained that may depend on @xmath48 .",
    "the angle @xmath48 can thus be understood as a variational parameter that modifies the adopted basis as can be seen from the inverse relation between basis - set exponents and the scaling angle discussed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "a diagonalization of the hamiltonian   in the basis described by the eqs .",
    "and yields the complex - scaled energies @xmath50 and wavefunctions @xmath51 where the latter are still defined by eq .  , but with complex coefficients @xmath52 .    with the aid of the complex - scaled energies and wavefunctions the transition - probability density into the electronic continuum",
    "can be extracted from the complex - scaled resolvent according to @xcite@xmath53 the @xmath54 is the biorthonormal eigenstate to @xmath55 .",
    "it is obtained from the latter by a transposition and complex conjugation of the angular part , while the radial part is only transposed but not complex conjugated .",
    "the sum over @xmath56 includes all complex - scaled eigenstates and eigenvalues calculated by solving the generalized complex symmetric , but non - hermitian eigenvalue problem . as discussed above in the limit of exact eigenstates the density @xmath57 becomes independent of the complex - scaling parameter @xmath48 .",
    "a variation of @xmath48 for approximate eigenstates provides the possibility to determine an optimal @xmath58 with highest stability .",
    "the best approximation of @xmath57 is then obtained according to@xmath59 furthermore , the @xmath48 dependence of the spectra gives an indication for the convergence of the results .",
    "in table  [ tab : disp ] the calculated transition probabilities for 15 @xmath60s bound states of @xmath29 are listed .",
    "the results reveal that almost every second @xmath1 decay will end in the first excited state of @xmath29 .",
    "the next probable final state is the @xmath29 ground state with nearly @xmath61 . with a summed probability of @xmath62 the higher excited @xmath29 states are rarely populated after @xmath0 decay of t@xmath63 .",
    "the sum over all calculated bound states yields @xmath64 .",
    "the summation over all calculated states ( discrete and discretized continuum states ) yields the expected value of @xmath65 , since the same basis is used for initial and all final states , but indicates the proper numerical implementation .",
    "the excellent agreement of the energy eigenvalues at the order of @xmath66 with the very accurate data in @xcite assures on the other hand the high quality of the basis set adopted in the present work and its ability to describe many states simultaneously with high precision .",
    "a closer view on the energies shows that the degree of accuracy of the present results follows the expected trends .",
    "first , the accuracy increases with @xmath35 , since the importance of correlation decreases , if the state becomes more asymmetric and the two electrons have smaller spatial overlap . for even higher values of @xmath35",
    "the states become increasingly diffuse and thus it is very difficult to describe them properly without running into numerically caused linear dependencies .    a comparison to the final - state probabilities reported by @xcite and @xcite is also given in table  [ tab : disp ] . especially for the highly populated ground and first excited states the results of this work confirm the expectedly very accurate results of @xcite that were obtained with explicitly correlated basis functions .",
    "the agreement for the third excited state ( @xmath67 ) is , however , less good , and for the second excited state @xmath68 there is even an order of magnitude difference .",
    "all attempts to improve the basis set for this state failed to yield a better agreement .",
    "this could be an indication for a typographical error ( a missing zero after the decimal point ) in @xcite .    the comparison with the results in @xcite that were obtained with a relativistic mcdf ( multi - configuration dirac - fock ) method shows on the other hand pronounced differences .",
    "the deviation is most remarkably for the first excited state that according to the present work and @xcite should be populated with about 47% probability and thus should clearly dominate the final - state distribution .",
    "however , in the mcdf results in @xcite its probability is found to be about 21% .",
    "for the other states , except @xmath69 , the results in @xcite are always smaller than the present ones .",
    "the deviation increases rather uniformly from about 17 to 28% for @xmath35 varying between 1 and 10 . since",
    "relativistic effects are expected to be small for light nuclei like @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it appears very likely that the main reason for the difference of the results in @xcite to the present ones ( as well as the ones in @xcite ) is due to the small number of configurations used in the mcdf method compared with the present full ci method .",
    "unfortunately , no details ( like energies ) of the mcdf calculation in @xcite are available to further clarify this issue , but any realistic estimate of the size of relativistic effects excludes their responsibility for the large discrepancy between the results in @xcite compared to the non - relativistic calculations of this work or the one in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : spectr ] .",
    "the overall spectrum is practically independent of @xmath48 .",
    "this indicates the high quality of the adopted basis set also for describing the electronic continuum .",
    "as is usually the case , ( higher lying ) resonances are most sensitive to the choice of @xmath48 .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is difficult to find a single value of @xmath48 that is equally appropriate for describing a certain resonance and the underlying background continuum .",
    "the continuum probability density is dominated by a peak corresponding to the first doubly excited singlet state 2s@xmath74 .",
    "about @xmath75 of the @xmath1 decays ends up in the energy interval between @xmath76 and @xmath77 . above the @xmath78 threshold the higher - lying doubly excited states 2s@xmath35s and in the regime up to @xmath79 ( with diminishing importance ) the 3s@xmath35s peaks can be identified .",
    "the complex - scaling method provides the probability density @xmath80 at any value of @xmath81 and thus as a continuous function . in view of the sharp resonant structures and in accordance with the experimental needs , the final - state distribution is given in a discretized form as in @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , the probability distribution @xmath80 has been divided into small bins covering an energy range of @xmath82ev ( up to a transition energy of @xmath83 ) , @xmath84ev ( from @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) , and @xmath87 ( from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ) . for each bin the average excitation energy @xmath90 and",
    "the integrated transition probability @xmath91 were calculated and are given in table  [ tab : dsp ] .    for the high - energy continuum states ( above @xmath89 )",
    "an approximate model tail is introduced , similar to the case of t@xmath31 @xcite . however , the situation is more complicated for t@xmath63 . in t@xmath31 @xmath0 decay",
    "the high - energy tail was derived based on the idea that for sufficiently large energies of the escaping ( formerly bound ) electron the effective potential of the remaining @xmath92het@xmath93 ion can be well approximated by a point charge @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , the remaining electron and tritium nucleus may be viewed as pure spectators and thus the transition probability should approach for high energies the one obtained for a @xmath0-decaying tritium _ atom _ for which an analytical result is known . due to the existence of two equivalent electrons , the atomic result is simply multiplied by a factor of two @xcite .    while for t@xmath31 a hydrogenic wavefunction is a reasonable first - order approximation for the initial state , this is not the case for t@xmath63 .",
    "in fact , within independent - particle models t@xmath63 is unstable . as a consequence , the fast electron in the final state",
    "may be well represented by a coulomb wavefunction for a point charge @xmath95 ( formed by the remaining he@xmath96 ion ) , but the modeling of the initial state is less obvious within an independent particle model .",
    "this is also evident from the alternative point of view that a description of the remaining t nucleus and bound electron as a spectator would correspond for the active electron to an initial state with @xmath97 and thus no bound state . in order to obtain an atomic - like high - energy tail the initial state",
    "is thus modeled as a hydrogen - like state with variable exponent .",
    "this exponent is then obtained by fitting the model spectrum to the ab initio spectrum of the full two - electron calculation in the energy range between 500ev and 10,000ev .",
    "the initial @xmath1 ground - state wavefunction ( omitting the spin part for better readability ) is then approximated as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is an sto with @xmath100 , i.e.  an atomic hydrogen 1s orbital with effective charge @xmath101 . in the spirit of the sudden approximation",
    "the spectator electron remains in its orbital and the final state of the @xmath102 ion is modeled as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the coulombic continuum wavefunction for energy @xmath81 and charge @xmath105 .",
    "using these model wavefunctions the analytic expression @xmath106 with @xmath107 and @xmath108 is obtained for the probability density , i.e.  for the model tail for the high - energy continuum states .",
    "a fit to the ab initio spectrum yielded @xmath109 .",
    "as is evident from the probability density decays exponentially for high energies which is the most essential property .",
    "( in fact , it has been verified that all subsequent conclusions are unchanged , if a different model tail is used in which the initial - state charge is fixed to the one of the tritium nucleus ( @xmath95 ) and the effective charge of the final coulomb wave is used as fit parameter . )",
    "[ fig : tail ] compares the calculated final - state probability density with the analytical model tail and confirms the applicability of the latter for high energies , in fact already starting from about 200 to 250ev , similarly as for t@xmath31 .",

    "the inset shows the probability density on a linear scale . ]",
    "the mean excitation energy @xmath111 relative to the electronic ground - state energy of @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath112 insertion of the final - state probability distribution calculated in this work in yields @xmath113 for the mean excitation energy of the decay product .",
    "this result may be compared to the one obtained by the alternative relation @xmath114 with the expectation value of @xmath115 and the ground state energy @xmath116 reported by frolov in @xcite the mean excitation energy calculated with is @xmath117 .",
    "frolov also reported the expectation values for the case of a finite mass of the tritium anion nuclei .",
    "again using for this case one obtains @xmath118 .",
    "this comparison confirms the quality of the final - state distribution obtained in this work and validates furthermore the use of the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus approximation .",
    "frolov noted in @xcite that his calculated bound - state probability appears to imply a continuum contribution of about 30% .",
    "since this value is about 10 time larger than the continuum probability known for neutral t atoms , he speculated that in fact a large number of decays ( about 15 to 20% ) may end up in triplet states of helium , leaving a much smaller fraction in the singlet continuum .",
    "the reasoning in @xcite is that the more diffuse ground state of t@xmath63 is not sufficient to explain such a large continuum contribution , as follows from a comparison to results obtained for rydberg states of neutral t atoms . on the other hand",
    ", triplet states may be populated by the ( virtual ) interaction with the @xmath0 electron omitted in the sudden approximation .",
    "this argumentation is , however , erroneous .",
    "as has been discussed in detail in @xcite , the sum rule for the sudden approximation gives always unity , independently on higher - order corrections to it .",
    "this is also ( as discussed above ) fulfilled by the present calculation which indeed confirms the about 30% continuum probability indirectly found but rejected in @xcite .",
    "finally , the exchange interaction is expected to be much smaller than the direct one ( in @xcite it was found for atomic tritium to be by a factor @xmath119 smaller ) , but already the direct term ( first term beyond the sudden approximation ) is by a factor @xmath119 smaller than the sudden approximation .",
    "close to the end point of tritium @xmath0 decay one finds for the sommerfeld parameter @xmath120 and for t@xmath31 it was explicitly shown that the first - order correction to the sudden approximation is itself of the order of @xmath119 and thus of the order of 0.01% @xcite , in accordance with corresponding system - independent sum rules given in @xcite .",
    "in this work the complete final - state probability distribution of he following the nuclear @xmath121 decay of tritium anions has been calculated . for the small number of bound states considered previously in @xcite",
    "the agreement is very good for the dominant ground and first excited states , but especially for the ( very weakly populated ) @xmath69 state a deviation by about an order of magnitude was found .",
    "it is preliminarily attributed to a possible typographical error .",
    "the agreement with an earlier relativistic multi - configuration dirac - fock calculation @xcite is on the other hand very poor .",
    "since such a large size of relativistic effects is not expected , especially not for the light nuclei involved , this deviation is attributed to a possibly too small basis set used in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the present study may stimulate further theoretical work to clarify the discrepancies to @xcite and of both works to the relativistic ones in @xcite .    in order to further test the accuracy of the present calculation ,",
    "the bound - state energies were compared to very accurate literature data and were found to agree very accurately with them .",
    "furthermore , the mean excitation energy obtained from the complete final - state spectrum was compared to the value predicted on the basis of closure . again , very good agreement was found .",
    "therefore , the results of this work should be reliable and of direct importance for the tritium neutrino - mass experiment katrin that is presently under construction . in order to allow the use in the experimental analysis and for predicting how much a possible t@xmath63 admixture to the t@xmath31 source spoils the extracted neutrino mass ,",
    "the continuum transition probability is given in binned form , but also available numerically on request .",
    "finally , it may be noted that a controlled admixture of t@xmath63 to the tritium source may in fact be used for the analysis of the experimental sensitivity to the atomic and molecular final - state spectrum ."
