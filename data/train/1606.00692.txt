    "the goal of this paper is to model the characteristics of a population when there are not enough data to model its single members .",
    "our case study is the distribution of the shape and spin characteristics of a large number of rotating objects in @xmath6 when we have random observations of the areas of their projections in different viewing geometries .",
    "this setup corresponds to the sporadic observations of the brightnesses of the asteroids in our solar system .    in the following , we consider some choices of observables and the corresponding models , cumulative distribution functions ( cdf ) , and distribution functions ( df ) . with dfs",
    ", we essentially take each observation to be an identical procedure , a repeated sample of the distribution .",
    "the targets lose their identity : observations of the same target at various times can be taken as independent samples of the df .",
    "our setup belongs to the general class of problems of the relation between some model df @xmath3 , @xmath7 , and the corresponding distribution @xmath8 in some space of observables @xmath9 , when the data are samples of @xmath10 . in the multidimensional case , this can be solved with likelihood methods or likelihood - free inference ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but if @xmath2 as here , the case is easier as the samples can be examined by forming a single cdf .",
    "we use cdfs of observables as they are well - defined non - binned directly measurable distribution quantities .",
    "thus we proceed by computing the model cdf from the model dfs and comparing it with the data cdf .",
    "our model cdf is determined by calculating by integration how many model configurations can contribute to the observed cdf at each value of the observable . the main problem is whether the thus obtained mapping @xmath11 is invertible .",
    "here @xmath12 is the df of some intrinsic properties @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the cdf of some observable @xmath5 .",
    "the physical realization of our case study was originally introduced by szab et al",
    "their study did not contain any analytical or numerical inspection of the generic inverse problem , especially its uniqueness and stability properties .",
    "their examination included over @xmath15 pieces of actual asteroid data , and they concluded that while the data are insufficient for obtaining the properties of individual bodies , a statistical analysis is possible .",
    "the asteroid population was treated as a distribution function .",
    "the approach of @xcite was innovative , and we aim to expand upon their study by investigating the inverse problem mathematically , including the role of the insufficient model and other assumptions that do not necessarily hold in practice ( such as the distribution of spins that was fixed in @xcite ) .",
    "we present both a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "we generate cumulative distribution functions of large asteroid population , aiming to study what the cdf reveals about the properties of the population .",
    "to keep our model simple and solvable , we choose to utilize as few parameters as possible .",
    "first we consider the shape elongation @xmath16 as our only parameter , while the spin latitude @xmath17 remains uniformly distributed .",
    "then we move on to a more advanced case where the distributions of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are to be solved .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain information about the @xmath17 distribution , which was missing from @xcite .",
    "our model shape is the triaxial ellipsoid , since it has a particularly simple analytical expression for the area of its projection in any given viewing direction @xcite . in this paper , we use the terms brightness and projection area interchangeably , because they are physically almost the same ( up to a scaling factor ) for dark targets when the viewing and illumination directions coincide @xcite .",
    "we further simplify the model ( semiaxes @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 .",
    "naturally this would be a coarse shape approximation for individual targets of general shape , but even if our model is actually not very realistic in practice , it should portray some coarse - scale population tendencies right when we have many observations .",
    "thus it suffices to have a model that represents the effects of shape elongation and spin direction in a roughly correct manner .",
    "first we consider the theory that would hold if our analytical shape model were correct .",
    "then , from sect .",
    "[ sec : asteroid ] on , we discuss the consequences caused by the incorrect model by numerically computing the brightnesses of general shapes , obtaining the brightness amplitude over one rotation of the body , and its cumulative distribution function .",
    "let us first assume isotropic spins and two model parameters : @xmath21 describing the shape elongation ( the smaller the @xmath16 , the more elongated the body ) , and @xmath22 for aspect angle : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the spin direction ( given by the polar coordinates @xmath25 in the inertial frame ) and @xmath26 the line of sight ( unit vectors ) . due to model symmetry , we only need to consider the interval @xmath27 . with @xmath28 for the longitudinal angle in a coordinate frame fixed to the ellipsoid , the area @xmath29 of the ellipsoid s projection in the direction @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath30 so in terms of our model definitions , the brightness @xmath31 scaled against the maximal possible value @xmath32 is @xmath33    the statistical observable can be anything that describes the variation of the brightness as the target rotates ( at a fixed @xmath22 ) . at first",
    "we take this to be the peak - to - peak amplitude ; here we consider the ratio @xmath34 ( i.e. , an `` inverse amplitude '' : the smaller the @xmath20 , the larger the variation ) .",
    "thus we have chosen the convenient @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( rather than either of these extending to infinity ) .",
    "the assumption is that all objects rotate about an axis ( the ellipsoid s @xmath37-axis ) , which produces the observed projections random in @xmath28 . at first",
    ", we consider the randomness of @xmath22 to be due to a uniform distribution of rotation axis directions on @xmath38 ; later , we take the randomness to be caused by a shifting viewing position .    the amplitude @xmath20 is given by @xmath39 so the iso-@xmath20 curves in the @xmath40-plane are given by @xmath41 the solutions for @xmath42 are convex `` ripples '' starting from the point @xmath43 ( upper left corner ) for @xmath44 and continuing to the lines @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ( lower right corner ) . denoting the model df of elongation by @xmath48 , we write the unnormalized cdf @xmath49 as @xmath50 where the minimal shape elongation needed to produce amplitude @xmath20 , obtained at @xmath51 , is @xmath52",
    ". thus @xmath53",
    "we can also include the effect of spin distribution .",
    "assuming @xmath54 to be isotropic and the observation directions to be in the @xmath55-plane of the inertial frame ( as they approximately are for the majority of asteroids , when this plane is that of the earth s orbit ) , we study the df @xmath56 ( or its joint df @xmath57 with @xmath16 ) , or the more useful @xmath58 . the minimal aspect angle is @xmath59 .",
    "now , substituting @xmath60 into @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is assumed isotropic ( evenly distributed longitudes of spins and observing directions ) .",
    "it is sufficient to explore the region @xmath64 $ ] as other quadrants are just symmetric multiples .",
    "the iso-@xmath22 curves @xmath65 in the @xmath66-plane are now expanding `` ripples '' of increasing @xmath22 starting from the point @xmath67 for @xmath45 .",
    "the cdf for @xmath22 is @xmath68 ( differentiating @xmath69 yields @xmath70 when @xmath71 as expected for isotropic spins . )",
    "using the complement of @xmath72 ( i.e. , @xmath73 in the decreasing direction from @xmath51 to @xmath45 ) to write the number of states between @xmath74 and @xmath51 , our cdf @xmath49 is @xmath75      if the amplitude can not be measured directly , a possible observable is the brightness variation around some mean value , requiring fewer points . using intensity",
    "squared , we obtain from eq .   a simple average quantity over model rotation at constant @xmath22 : @xmath77 the standard deviation over rotation is @xmath78 ^ 2\\rangle}\\\\ & = \\sin^2\\theta(1-p^2 ) \\left [ \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi}(\\cos^4\\phi-\\cos^2\\phi)\\,d\\phi + \\frac{1}{4 } \\right]^{1/2}=\\sin^2\\theta(1-p^2)/\\sqrt{8 } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and normalizing this with @xmath79 yields @xmath80^{-1}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath81 . thus , by eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) , our brightness deviation @xmath76 is directly related to the amplitude @xmath20 : @xmath82 this is a particular advantage of the biaxial model : we can use all observations of @xmath20 and @xmath76 together to form a @xmath49 instead of having to compute a @xmath83 by forming a @xmath84 and continuing as for @xmath85 above ( resulting in similar types of integrals ) .",
    "the latter would be the case for the triaxial ellipsoid , since @xmath76 would depend on @xmath22 ( and @xmath37 ) in addition to @xmath20 .",
    "if there are not enough points covering the rotational phase to estimate @xmath20 even by @xmath76 , we can use simple two - point brightness differences . for a group of @xmath87",
    "points for one target , we have @xmath88 such values , ordered such that the difference @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "we do not need to have more than one such pair for one target , so one object does not have to cover the rotational phases well .",
    "this is the observable used in @xcite .",
    "as before , we consider the case when @xmath22 is ( approximately ) the same for the pair .",
    "now we have , for two rotation phases @xmath91 and @xmath28 , @xmath92 so , with @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 ( due to symmetry , we only need to consider the interval @xmath95 ) , we define iso-@xmath86 contours in the @xmath96 plane ( for given @xmath97 ) by @xmath98 so , to have viable solutions for @xmath99 from @xmath100 , we must have @xmath101 , @xmath94 , and @xmath102 so @xmath28 exist for given @xmath103 only if @xmath104 ; i.e. , @xmath105 denoting @xmath106 our cdf is thus @xmath107 again , we can include the @xmath17-distribution by expanding the integral in the same way as with eq .  .",
    "in this section , we consider the properties of the inverse problem version of the forward model above .",
    "first we show that the problem of recovering the @xmath16-distribution from @xmath76-data has a unique solution ( for the simplified model ) , and the ill - posedness is not severe .",
    "then we discuss practical methods of solution before moving to realistic shapes and numerical simulations in the following sections .",
    "we also discuss the reason why @xmath76-data are sufficient for recovering @xmath57 , while the two - point @xmath86-data only suffice for @xmath48 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath48 is uniquely derivable from @xmath49 ( i.e. , @xmath76-scatter data ) , and the problem is ( moderately ) ill - posed .",
    "we can always assume that the observed @xmath49 can be expressed as a polynomial ( @xmath14 is bounded and @xmath108 ) to an arbitrary precision and degree by , e.g. , linear sets of equations or orthogonal functions ( since this construction is not used in practice , it is immaterial how the expansion is obtained ) .",
    "then , by the lemma of the appendix , the polynomial coefficients of @xmath48 are uniquely determined , and any errors in the coefficients of @xmath49 blow up at infinite degree at a rate proportional to the degree .",
    "the results holds for @xmath76-data as well , since @xmath20 is uniquely derivable from @xmath76 .      in an approximation consistent with the coarseness of the model , it is practical to assume the population to consist of a moderate number @xmath109 of bins in each of which all members have the same @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 ) .",
    "then , if we have only @xmath16-bins and isotropic @xmath22 , @xmath110 where the basis functions @xmath111 are , from eq .",

    "are sorted in ascending order , and the vector @xmath14 contains the observed cdf : each element @xmath119 is the value of @xmath14 at @xmath120 .     on a set of bins @xmath121 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 . ]",

    "( [ capx ] ) , the monotonously increasing basis functions @xmath126 , with the range @xmath127 $ ] , are , on a @xmath128-grid , @xmath129 the @xmath126 are sigmoidal functions ( fig .  [ fij ] ) , approaching the step function when @xmath130 ( step at @xmath47 ) or @xmath131 ( step at @xmath132 ) .",
    "because of our choice of scale of @xmath16 and @xmath20 , parts of the @xmath133 tend to pack together at the low end of @xmath20 , making them less well distinguishable than those with the slope in the higher end of @xmath20 , but on the other hand , @xmath16-values less than 0.4 are not likely for real celestial bodies .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath134 are assigned to each bin , and occupation levels proportional to @xmath135 mean a uniform density on the direction sphere .     on a set of bins @xmath136 , where @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath137 , @xmath123 , @xmath138 . ]",
    "the bin model @xmath134 are uniquely determined by the @xmath49 .",
    "the pairs of end points ; i.e. , the values of @xmath20 between which @xmath133 changes ( @xmath139 at @xmath140 and @xmath141 at @xmath142 ) , are unique for each @xmath133",
    ". any combination of @xmath133 will start to deviate from zero at the lowest @xmath139 of the set , and stop changing at the highest @xmath141 of the set .",
    "thus both end points of an @xmath133 can not be matched by a superposition of other @xmath143 , so the @xmath133 are linearly independent . since the model @xmath49 is a linear combination of the @xmath133 , the @xmath134 are unique for the observed @xmath49 .",
    "the basis function @xmath144 for a given @xmath121 in the two - point brightness scatter case is , from eq .",
    "( [ cqp ] ) , @xmath145 although the @xmath28-integral can be given in terms of elliptic functions , this is best computed by evaluating the double integral numerically .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath144 is obtained at @xmath146 : @xmath147 our basis functions @xmath148 are closed - form expressions of those computed by monte - carlo sampling in @xcite .    in principle",
    ", we can expand @xmath148 to @xmath149 for a @xmath128-grid in the same way that @xmath113 were expanded to @xmath133 .",
    "however , a notable difference between the two - index basis functions of @xmath20- or @xmath86- data is that the @xmath149 all reach their maxima at the same point @xmath146 since the two - point comparison can always contain two equal brightnesses for any @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus the @xmath150-curves of the @xmath149 of a given @xmath121 form a curve family with the same abscissae for the minimum ( @xmath151 ) and maximum ( @xmath146 ) ; i.e. , members of the family can easily be mimicked by a superposition of other members unlike in the case of @xmath126 .",
    "thus @xmath152 are not usable for solving the inverse problem in practice ; i.e. , @xmath17-information is not recoverable from @xmath86-data as we will note below .",
    "if we want to use regularization to smooth the solutions for either @xmath16 or @xmath17 , we may apply , e.g. , the following @xmath153 regularization matrix in the @xmath16-only case : @xmath154 and its generalization for the @xmath155-grid , as well as similarly @xmath156 with @xmath17 .",
    "these approximate the gradients at each @xmath134 in the @xmath16- and @xmath17-directions only ; one can construct more general matrices , but we found these to suffice for our problem .",
    "the occupation numbers can be obtained as a solution to an optimization problem : @xmath157 to obtain the solution @xmath158 , we create an extended matrix @xmath159 : @xmath160 assuming a @xmath161-grid of the size @xmath162 with , respectively , @xmath163 and @xmath164 equally spaced @xmath16- and @xmath17-values , and we find the least - squares solution of @xmath165 with the constraint that each element of @xmath166 be larger than or equal to zero .",
    "due to the instability of the problem , the direct unconstrained matrix solution would lead to negative values , but in , e.g. , the matlab environment , the positivity constraint is simple to enforce with a function that uses quadratic programming .",
    "we found that this is more practical than nonlinear optimization with , e.g. , @xmath167 .",
    "the ellipsoid is a very crude approximation of an asteroid , so we test our approach with simulated data created with more general shapes .",
    "these can produce brightness variation over @xmath28 that is much more complicated than that of the ellipsoid , even when the shapes are convex @xcite .",
    "for such shapes , the concept of elongation is no longer as well defined as for ellipsoids , but we estimate @xmath168 simply by choosing @xmath169 to be the longest diameter in the @xmath55-plane , and @xmath170 the width in the corresponding orthogonal direction .    for convex shapes , the projected area ( i.e. , brightness with geometric scattering ) can be computed as a sum over visible facets of a polyhedral representation : @xmath171 where @xmath172 , @xmath173 is the area of the facet , @xmath174 is the outward unit normal vector , and @xmath175 is the direction of the illumination source .",
    "this makes simulations very fast ( for non - convex shapes , ray tracing is required to determine which facets are visible , but their brightness variation can be well described by convex shapes when viewing and illumination directions are close to each other ) .",
    "we utilize asteroid shape models available at damit to create our data .",
    "we also generate additional , artificial shapes by applying basic transformations ( such as stretching and shrinking ) on the original shape models to populate @xmath16-bins at will .",
    "the damit shapes reproduce the typical brightness variations seen in actual asteroids , so with them we can extensively simulate real data . when cdfs of actual observations are created , one should choose data from as closely coinciding viewing and illumination directions as possible to reduce further modelling errors .    in eq .",
    ", the condition @xmath176 may be violated at some measurements of @xmath177 when the parameter @xmath16 is low ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "if @xmath179 , it follows that the amplitude @xmath20 becomes purely imaginary according to eq .",
    "this error is caused by the model , as the ellipsoidal approximation of a convex asteroid is inaccurate .",
    "we have omitted these complex amplitudes in our study . in practice , the majority of realistic values of @xmath16 are in the range of @xmath180 $ ] , so it is rare that complex amplitudes are encountered",
    ".     plotted together with the data cdf @xmath49 . here",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath134 were solved as an inverse problem for a single asteroid .",
    "this shows that if one target of general shape is used for the cdf simulations , the basis functions @xmath133 are not very useful . ]    , but here the occupation numbers @xmath134 were solved using a population of @xmath181 asteroids .",
    "compared to fig ,  [ fig : fitting01 ] , the function series converges to the cdf more accurately due to the large shape population .",
    "the relative error is about 0.5% .",
    "this shows that , for large populations , the shape deviations from ellipsoids actually cancel the systematic effects of each other , so the basis functions @xmath133 are very good for describing the cdf . ]",
    "we have roughly three major sources of error in our simulations .",
    "first , assume gaussian noise on the brightness function , @xmath182 . we can assume the relative noise level is fairly small , @xmath183 .",
    "second , while the observations for different values of @xmath22 are numerous ( thousands of targets are observed , but most of them only at one @xmath22 , so individual targets can not be modelled ) , the observations of @xmath28 are typically scarce in most sky surveys to which our methods pertain . for our simulations , we have a minimum sample of 10 observations of @xmath28 for each asteroid if @xmath76 is to be estimated .",
    "third , our model is incorrect , as the actual shape of an asteroid is actually not an ellipsoid .",
    "we observed that the systematic error of the model dominates over the noise on the brightness function . assuming a reasonably bounded noise level , the effect of the noise can be considered insignificant .",
    "the limited number of @xmath28 causes inaccuracy in the brightness function , which makes the estimation of @xmath76 harder , especially with a small sample of asteroids .",
    "however , if we have a small sample population , the model error still dominates over the low number of observations . for a sample of @xmath184 asteroids and 10 observations of @xmath28 for each brightness measurement ,",
    "the error in @xmath76 becomes small , and apparently the incorrect model is practically the only cause of error .",
    "[ fig : fitting01 ] illustrates the effect of the model shape error .",
    "we have plotted the function series @xmath185 from eq .   in the same plot with a simulated cdf @xmath49 .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath134 have been solved from eq .  ; obviously the ellipsoidal basis functions do not converge fast if simulations are done with one non - ellipsoidal shape .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting02 ] , when the cdf is constructed from a population of varying non - ellipsoidal shapes , the basis functions @xmath133 converge well .",

    "we note that our simulation automatically avoided `` inverse crime '' since the synthetic data were constructed with a model entirely different from the one used in inversion . on the other hand , because of this , the recovered distributions can never be expected to be very accurate .",
    "as the @xmath17-distribution is considerably harder to obtain accurately than the @xmath16-distribution , more regularization is needed for @xmath17 . however , as we are more interested in locating the peaks of @xmath16- and @xmath17-distributions than obtaining a perfectly smooth solution , we choose fairly small values for our regularization parameters . in our simulations",

    "we find that the simple ellipsoid model is , perhaps somewhat surprisingly , viable for estimating the basic shape and spin characteristics of object ( asteroid ) populations when the size of the population is sufficiently large ( at least of order hundreds of targets or observations at various aspect angles @xmath22 ) .",
    "we have presented a theoretical study of the shape and spin parameters and functions as well as a number of corresponding observables , and proven the uniqueness and stability properties of the inverse problem .",
    "the theoretical analysis was supported by simulations that confirmed the feasibility of our approach , and also showed that it is possible to obtain the distribution of the spin latitude parameter @xmath17 when there are enough observations per target , although this is less accurate than for the shape elongation @xmath16 .",
    "if there are only two observations per target , information on @xmath17 is essentially lost .",
    "we have also given closed - form expressions of the basis functions of the two - point case derived in @xcite by random sampling .",
    "one can devise other observables in addition to those presented here .",
    "the main limitation is that , in practice , the measurements should consist of measures of brightness variation for single targets at fixed @xmath22 to remain invariant of scaling and other modelling aspects .",
    "one possibility is the derivative of the brightness variation ( two measurements within a short time interval ) .",
    "however , in the inverse problem the derivative is a nonunique mixture of shape elongation and rotation rate ( and rotation axis latitude ) , so the result is almost entirely dependent on what one chooses for prior distributions .",
    "for example , one could fix the elongation to one value and explain any observed derivative distribution by rotation rate distribution only .",
    "the physical realization of the observables occurs mostly in large sky surveys and long observation campaigns . in these",
    ", one can often model individual targets even with of order one hundred data points as long as they cover a long time interval @xcite , but for many targets one only obtains a few data points that can be analyzed with the methods discussed here . in a study to be published elsewhere",
    ", we apply our methods to various real datasets of sufficient size for distribution analysis , and investigate the related practical issues by realistic simulations and tests .",
