    "bl lacertae objects are an extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) emitting highly variable non - thermal radiation over 20 decades of frequency from radio to tev energies .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the production of radiation over such a wide range is thought to be synchrotron emission followed by inverse compton scattering from energetic electrons .",
    "some of the extreme properties of bl lac objects , such as rapid variability , high gamma - ray luminosities and superluminal motion ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , are explained invoking relativistic beaming of the emitted radiation along the jet axis which is taken to be oriented at small angles to the line of sight .",
    "is one of the closest ( @xmath3=0.0308 ) and best studied bl lacertae objects .",
    "it is one of the strongest tev sources and one of the brightest extragalactic euv sources .",
    "the euv emission of during quiescence is believed to be the peak of a synchrotron spectrum .",
    "was monitored by the _",
    "euve _ satellite for four years ( 1994,1995,1996 and 1998 ) as part of multiwavelength campaigns and it was serendipitously observed in 1995 and in 1997 with the _ euve _",
    "photometers for a total of one million seconds , the best sampled light curve for any bl lac object at high energies .",
    "table  1 summarizes all the _ euve _ observations .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to analyze in an homogeneous way the 1100  ks of _ euve _ public imaging data for ( less than half of it has been analyzed to date , fruscione et al .",

    "our analysis reveals the existence of a characteristic timescale for that can constrain current models .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : all the _ euve _ lightcurves of collected from 1994 to 1997 are presented in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we present the results from the power spectrum and structure function analysis , respectively . in section 5",
    "we discuss those results .",
    "finally in section 6 we give some conclusionary remarks .",
    "for the energy spectrum data and analysis we refer the reader to the companion paper cagnoni & fruscione ( 2000 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "a general description of the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ satellite ( ) is given in paper  i. the photometric instruments on board _ euve _ are the deep survey / spectrometer , ( ds / s , covering the 68 - 178   band for photometry ; welsh et al .",
    "1990 ) used for the deep euv survey along the ecliptic and for pointed spectroscopic and imaging observations , and three co - aligned photometers ( the `` scanners '' ) , observing in four different bandpasses ( from 58 to 740  ) and mounted orthogonally to the ds / s .",
    "the photometers were used to carry out the  all - sky survey and are now employed in the `` right angle program '' ( i.e. the observation of serendipitous targets while the ds / s is conducting the primary science observation ) . figure  [ fig1 ] shows a comparison of the ds / s and scanner effective areas .    was observed several times from 1994 to 1997 : four times with the ds / s and twice with the scanners ; table  1 summarizes these observations . because of interstellar medium absorption along the line of sight ( @xmath4  @xmath5 , elvis , wilkes & lockman 1989 ) , was detected only in the lexan / b filter ( the shortest wavelength bandpass ) both in the scanners ( 58 - 174   ) and in the ds / s ( 67 - 178   ) .",
    "two faint serendipitous sources are clearly visible next to  in the ds image .",
    "we identified the closest one ( @xmath6 from ) with 2 unresolved stars in a double system : hd  95934 ( @xmath7 , spectral type a3iii - iv ) and bd+39  2414b(@xmath8 ) .",
    "the other one at @xmath9 from was identified with another star in double system : hd  95976 ( @xmath10 , spectral type fii ) .",
    "the ds 50% energy radius is about @xmath11 up to @xmath12 off - axis . in scanner",
    "a , this half energy radius is @xmath13 at @xmath14 off - axis ( where the sources lied in the 1995 and 1997 observations ) and the sources are not resolved . during the analysis of ds data we excluded a circle centered on hd  95934 ; this excluded only a negligible fraction of counts from .",
    "we extracted the light curves from the ds or scanner time - ordered event lists using the _ euve _ guest observer center software ( iraf / euv package ) and other iraf timing tasks adapted for _ euve _ data .",
    "all the lightcurves were binned over one average _ euve _ orbit ( 5544  s ) , but effective exposure times per bin vary due to several correction factors different case by case ( e.g. instrumental deadtime , telemetry saturation , high particle background , dead spot ) .    unless described otherwise , we chose the extraction region for the source as a circle with a 2.5@xmath15 radius excluding a circle with a 0.67@xmath15 radius centered on the serendipitous source .",
    "the background region is an annulus with inner and outer radii equal to @xmath9 and @xmath16 respectively which avoids the other serendipitous source .    in order to compare scanner and ds data , we had to normalize the count rates .",
    "count rates depend on the effective area of the telescope and on the spectral shape of the source .",
    "we convolved a sample of input spectra ( absorbed power law with slopes as in table 2 of 1 ) with the ds and scanner effective areas and defined the normalization factor as the ratio of peak of the derived count rates ( see figure  [ fig2 ] as an example for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the average normalization factor is about 1.4@xmath180.3 ( depending on the input spectrum ) .",
    "we used this value throughout the paper and verified that the results in the power spectrum analysis are all consistent within the errors of this value .",
    "the combined light curve of all the observations is presented in figure  3 . in this section",
    "we will give a qualitative description of each lightcurve in terms of flares and sub - flares : a general rising / decreasing trend will be addressed as a `` flare '' , while faster variations superimposed on the general trend will be referred to as sub - flares .",
    "this description is useful in understanding the results from the power spectrum and structure function analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the 1994 light curve , which was obtained eliminating time intervals when the source crossed the dead spot ( about 1440 s ) .",
    "the source dimmed for about 3 days , brightened again for another @xmath19 days , until it reached a level of @xmath20 counts / sec and stayed there for the remaining of the observation ( another @xmath19 days ) .",
    "this light curve behavior could be sampling the end of a flare and the beginning of a new one .",
    "interestingly , when the source increases its flux , after mjd  49447 , ( i.e. possibly during the beginning of a new flare ) smaller  sub - flares \" are superimposed on it ; this trend is also present in the 1995 scanner lightcurve ( see 2.2.2 and figure  [ fig5 ] )",
    ".      during this scanner exposure optimized for the primary scientific ds / s observation of hd  41511 , partially falls in the region usually discarded by the standard analysis pipeline because of the obscuration due to the filter support and because of the high particle background close to the detector edge .",
    "we extracted the lightcurve only from the `` clean '' region of the detector and we corrected the count rate for the fraction of the count lost ( @xmath010% ) . the background region was chosen in the same detector quadrant as the source and large enough to match the ratio background / source ( @xmath21 ) region used for the other lightcurves .",
    "the lightcurve is plotted in figure  [ fig5 ] ; the open circles represent the count rate measured in scanner a , while the filled circles are the count rate normalized to the ds ; this lightcurve has as behavior similar to the 1994 ds lightcurve : when the source brightens , after mjd  49754 , `` sub - flares '' appear above the main trend .      during this ds / s observation ,",
    "the source was pointed 0.3@xmath22 off axis both to avoid the dead spot and to extend the spectrum toward shorter wavelengths ( see 1 ) .",
    "the light curve is shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "the behavior of the source during the ds 1995 observation is complex : at the beginning brightens by a factor of @xmath23% in less than 2 days and this flare , which lasts for about 3 days , is well correlated to a tev / x - ray flare ( buckley  1996 ) .",
    "right after the first one , there is a second flare lasting for @xmath24 days which can also be seen as the superposition of two separate flares ( the second one starting at @xmath0 mjd 49838 ) .",
    "after mjd 49845.5 , the source rises from @xmath25 counts s@xmath26 , up to @xmath27 counts s@xmath26 , and then decays to @xmath28 counts s@xmath26 , within @xmath2 days .",
    "the overall variability of the source is about a factor 3 .      in 1996",
    "was observed few days before and few days after the detection of a large tev flare on may 7th 1996 ( zweerink  1997 ) .",
    "the lightcurves are shown in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "this lightcurve looks different from all the other ones because no slow variations seem to be present ; the source appears to be at a constant level with lots of small amplitude , fast variations superimposed on it ; i.e. , the light curve appears to be the sum of flares which live a short time , and rise or decay faster when compared with the flares seen in the other light curves ( see for example the two flare like events after mjd=50200 ) .      in 1997",
    "was observed for 4 days with the scanner a telescope during the ds pointed observation of @xmath29  tauri ; the source was detected within the useful area of the scanner a field of view allowing an easier data reduction than the previous scanner observation .",
    "the light curve is shown in figure  [ fig8 ] : the open circles represent the scanner data while the filled circles correspond to the count rate normalized to the ds .",
    "this is the shortest lightcurve and its shape suggests that we may be looking at the tail of a flare and at the beginning of a new one .",
    "in order to quantify the variability seen in the  lightcurves of , we computed their periodogram as :    @xmath30e^{-i2\\pi \\nu_{i } t_{i } } \\}^{2}-c,\\ ] ]    where : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the mean value , bin size and number points of each light curve respectively , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( e.g. deeming 1975 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath36 in equation ( 1 ) represents the power level due to poisson statistics , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the error of each light curve point ) .",
    "the subtraction of this constant level is necessary since we are interested in the source power spectrum only and the _ euve _ light curves were obtained with two different instruments , hence the poisson statistics will be different in them .",
    "the periodogram calculated in this way has the units of ( counts / sec)@xmath39/hz , and its integral over positive frequencies is equal to half the light curve variance .",
    "it is common to average the periodogram estimates in order to reduce the variance and approximate their probability distribution function to a gaussian .",
    "furthermore , it is better to estimate the logarithm of the power spectrum instead of the power spectrum itself , since the logarithmic transformation brings the distribution function of the power spectrum estimates closer to a gaussian ( papadakis & lawrence , 1993 ) . therefore , we calculated the logarithm of the binned periodogram estimates ,    @xmath40 = \\log_{10 } [ \\frac{\\sum_{j } \\hat{i}(\\nu_{j})}{m}],\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) and used it as our estimate of the _ logarithm _ of the power spectrum .",
    "the index @xmath43 varies over @xmath44 consecutive periodogram estimates and the index @xmath45 varies over the @xmath46/m$ ] subsets into which we have grouped the periodogram estimates .",
    "taking into account the propagation of errors ( e.g. bevington 1969 ) , the error on the logarithm of the power spectrum is    @xmath47)= \\log_{10}(e)\\sigma_{\\hat{p}(\\nu_{i})}/\\hat{p}(\\nu_{i}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the square root of the variance of the @xmath49 s around the mean value , @xmath50 , at each bin .",
    "we estimated the power spectrum of the ds and scanner a light curves binned over one average _",
    "euve _ orbit ( 5544 s ) shown in figures  [ fig3 ]  [ fig8 ] . to avoid the gap in 1995 ds observation ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) we divided it into 2 parts and performed a power spectrum analysis on each one of them . using equations  1 and 2",
    ", we estimated the logarithm of the power spectrum with @xmath51 . a larger value for @xmath44 would bring the distribution function of the power spectrum estimates closer to a gaussian ( papadakis & lawrence 1993 )",
    "however this small value of @xmath44 was necessary in order to have a reasonable frequency resolution , i.e. in order to have the maximum possible number of power spectral points above the poisson noise level .",
    "the power spectra of all the light curves , normalized to the square mean value of the respective light curve , are shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the normalisation is necessary if one wants to compare the power spectrum amplitudes , since the light curves were obtained from two different instruments .",
    "all the power spectra show a similar red noise behavior at frequencies @xmath52hz ( i.e. all of them rise logarithmically towards lower frequencies in a similar way ) , except for ds 1996 observation which seems to flatten for @xmath53  hz .",
    "we fitted the ds power spectra with a simple power law model of the form @xmath54 ( the scanner a power spectra had too few points to fit a model to them ) . in this model",
    ", the normalization @xmath55 is equal to the value of @xmath56 at @xmath57 hz .",
    "the model fit was done using the power spectra before normalizing to the mean square value .",
    "the best model fit results are listed in table  2 .",
    "the model gives a good fit to all the ds power spectra , but , due to the small number of points , the errors on the model parameters are large .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath55 are within the errors for all the ds spectra .",
    "however , the best fit slope values show a larger scatter . in particular , the difference between the ds 1995 ( part 1 ) and the ds 1996 best fit slope values is @xmath58 .",
    "this @xmath59 difference indicates that the shape of the power spectrum does not remain constant with time , i.e. that the euv emission of is not stationary .",
    "however , looking at ds 1996 power spectrum ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) , there is a possibility that the flatter slope obtained from the fit is due to a flattening around @xmath57 hz .",
    "if this is the case , a broken power law model should give a better fit to the data .",
    "however , with just 5 points , it is not possible to investigate if a broken power improves the fit to the data in a statistically significant way ( e.g. by the use of an f - test ) . on the other hand ,",
    "perhaps the flattening of the power spectrum is a spurious effect introduced by the small binning used ( @xmath51 ) . in an attempt of ruling out this possibility we used a larger value ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "figure[fig10 ] compares the results : open circles for @xmath51 ( as in figure  [ fig9 ] ) and filled circles for @xmath60 .",
    "both power spectra look similar , and the lack of frequency resolution in the latter case can not allow us to reach a firm conclusion .    despite this possible non - stationarity , it is useful to combine the periodograms of all the ds and scanner a light curves in order to increase the number of power spectrum estimates ( and hence the frequency resolution ) .",
    "we first normalized the data sets to the square mean value of the respective light curve and then combined them into one dataset by sorting them in order of increasing frequency .",
    "then we grouped this  combined \" periodogram into bins of size @xmath60 since the larger number of estimates allows us to use a larger bin size value .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows a plot of the resulting power spectrum ( filled circles ) .",
    "note that the combined power spectrum has the units of hz@xmath26 .",
    "this spectrum can be considered as the `` average '' euve power spectrum of the source .",
    "a power law model gives a good fit to this average power spectrum ( solid line in figure  [ fig11 ] ; table  2 ) with a best fit slope value of @xmath61 .",
    "due to the indication of a possible break in the power spectrum and/or a possible non - stationarity in the _ euve _ light curve of mrk  421 , we decided to investigate further the power spectra of the ds 1995 and 1996 light curves .",
    "our main aim was to determine the high frequency shape of the power spectrum as well as possible .",
    "for this reason , we used a @xmath62 times finer binning , with a bin size of 500  s , for the light curves ; we were thus able to extend the power spectrum to higher frequencies and to use a larger value for @xmath44 ( @xmath60 in equation 2 ) to bring the distribution function of the power spectrum estimates closer to a gaussian .",
    "figure 12 shows the ds 1995 and 1996 power spectra estimated with equation ( 1 ) , without subtracting the expected poisson noise level , and binned as in equation ( 2 ) with @xmath60 ; the long dashed lines in these plots indicate the poisson noise power level @xmath36 .",
    "both power spectra show a large peak at @xmath63 hz corresponding to a period of 5556 s , i.e. the  orbital period .",
    "the next strongest peak is at a harmonic of that frequency .",
    "these peaks are due to the uneven sampling of the 500  s binned light curves .    apart from those peaks ,",
    "the two power spectra appear to have a similar shape : they rise towards low frequencies , and they are flat at higher frequencies .",
    "so , it seems as if the use of a smaller bin size in the light curves has not helped us much .",
    "the power spectra , at most frequencies , appear to be flat and dominated by the poisson noise power .",
    "however , while the ds 1995 estimates at high frequencies are close to the expected poisson power level , the ds 1996 power spectrum is higher than this level .",
    "we fitted both spectra with a modified power law model with one of the slopes fixed at 2.14 ( see below ) . due to the effects of the window function ,",
    "it is not possible to fit the logarithm of the model directly to the power spectrum calculated from the 500 sec binned light curves .",
    "instead , we convolved the model , let us say @xmath64 , with the window function at each frequency @xmath65 ,    @xmath66    the function @xmath67 takes account of the window function effects .",
    "we call @xmath67 the `` convolved model '' .    as @xmath64 , we used the following function ,    @xmath68^{\\alpha}}+c,\\ ] ]    which has a power law form with a slope of @xmath69 at frequencies @xmath70 , and flattens to zero slope at frequencies @xmath71 ( as before , @xmath36 represents the power level due to the poisson counting statistics ) .",
    "note that as @xmath64 we did not use a simple power law model because in this case it is not easy to estimate the convolution model ( equation  4 ) analytically ( a simple power law model can not be defined at @xmath72 ) and because there might indeed be a break , as suggested by ds 1996 power spectrum ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "then , we averaged the convolved model @xmath73 over groups of size @xmath60 exactly as we did when estimating the power spectrum .",
    "the logarithm of the convolved model power spectrum becomes :    @xmath74=\\log_{10 } [ \\frac{\\sum_{j } i_{mdl}(\\nu_{j})}{m}].\\ ] ]    we can now fit @xmath75 $ ] to the estimated power spectrum , @xmath76 $ ] . in this way , we are taking into account both the window function and any effect that the binning procedure may have on the power spectrum estimation .",
    "for the fit we used standard @xmath77 statistics , we kept @xmath69 fixed to the value 2.14 , and we did not allow @xmath36 to vary but rather used the value found as described at the beginning of section 3 .",
    "table  3 summarizes the best fit results for each observation ; the errors quoted represent the 90% confidence levels assuming that @xmath55 and @xmath78 are correlated . by far",
    "the largest @xmath77 value is for the ds 1996 model fit .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to judge the goodness of fit using the these @xmath77 values . due to the uneven sampling of the light curves , the periodogram estimates are no longer independent .",
    "therefore , the errors on @xmath76 $ ] may be larger than those estimated ( and hence the @xmath77 values smaller ) . at the same time",
    ", depending on the amount of correlation between the @xmath79 s , the @xmath76 $ ] estimates may be correlated as well . as a result",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom may be smaller than those listed in table  3 .",
    "the best model fits are also plotted in figure 12 with a solid line ; these plots show that the model agrees well with the ds 1995 power spectrum , but not with the ds 1996 ( as expected from the large @xmath77 value ) .",
    "we fitted again the ds 1996 power spectrum with the model defined in equation  ( 5 ) but we let the slope as a free parameter this time .",
    "the best fit results are listed in table  3 ( values in a parenthesis ) , and the best fit model is also plotted in figure  12 ( b ) ( dotted line ) . as this figure shows , the new model fit agrees better with the power spectrum . the best fit slope is now @xmath80 significantly smaller than the average slope of @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath77 value is also reduced by 74.9 .",
    "the ratio of the reduced @xmath77 values for the two fits is 2.1 ( note that this ratio does not depend on whether the errors on the power spectrum are underestimated or not ) . using the number of degrees of freedom listed in table  3 and the f - test",
    ", we find that the improvement on the fit when we let the slope to be a free variable is highly significant ( the probability of a significantly better fit when @xmath82 is larger than @xmath83 ) . the probability remains larger than @xmath84 , even if the degree of freedoms listed in table  3 are reduced by a factor of two .",
    "furthermore , to check for any other possible indication of non - stationarity , we performed a fit to the power spectra of all the 500 sec binned light curves ( including the scanner a light curves ) using the model defined in equation  ( 5 ) with @xmath85 .",
    "the best fit model results are listed in table  3 , and the best fit model , together with the power spectra , are plotted in figure  13 ( the dotted lines in this figure show the poisson noise power level ) .",
    "this figure shows that the model gives a good fit to all the power spectra .",
    "we conclude that all the _ euve _ power spectra of are consistent with a power law model with a slope of @xmath86 .",
    "the only exception is the power spectrum of the ds 1996 , which shows a significantly flatter slope of @xmath87 . the clear change in slope in the 1996 data shows that the euv emission of is not statistically stationary ( see section  5.4 ) .",
    "as hinted by figure  [ fig9 ] for ds 1996 ( open circles ) , from the fit of the @xmath88  s binned power spectra we found indication for the presence of a low frequency turn over in the _ euve _ power spectrum of below which the power spectrum flattens .",
    "this finding , if confirmed , would be the first detection of a break in the power spectrum of a bl lac object . since we can not estimate the power spectrum at frequencies lower than @xmath89 hz , using the value @xmath60",
    ", we can not be certain of the slope below the turn over frequency .",
    "all we can say with the present data is that the power spectrum should show a change in its slope at @xmath78 .",
    "furthermore the value of this knee frequency is not constrained very well from our data . using the best fit results from the ds spectra only ( as they have the largest number of data points ) , we get a straight mean value of @xmath90 hz . by simply combining the overlapping @xmath91 confidence limits on the best values of @xmath78",
    ", we find that with probability larger than @xmath92 , @xmath78 should be between @xmath93 hz and @xmath94 hz .    from a physical point of view , it is natural to expect that low frequency knees should be present in the power spectra of agn .",
    "lack of this turnover would imply a physical system with infinite variance , a system whose properties change continuously with time .",
    "the frequency turnover is not evident in the combined _ euve _ power spectrum of ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) , because that spectrum does not extend to frequencies below @xmath95 hz .",
    "its presence is implied only when we take proper account of the window function effects in the model fitting of the 500  s light curve power spectra .",
    "if the frequency turn over were located at a much lower frequency , more power would be transfered to higher frequencies .",
    "the resulting power spectrum would have a higher normalization than the observed one .",
    "to put in other words , the amplitude of the variations in the light curves would be larger , i.e. they should have a higher variance .",
    "for example let us assume that the source power spectrum is well describe by equation ( 5 ) and that the break is at @xmath96 hz .",
    "using equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) we can predict how the power spectrum of the ds 1995 light curve should be in this case ( dotted line in figure  12a ) . as this figure shows",
    ", the power spectrum should have a much larger amplitude than the one that is actually observed .    due to the significance of such a feature in the power spectrum of the source , we searched further evidence of its existence by means of a structure analysis of the light curves .",
    "we present below the results from this analysis of the _ euve _ light curves which confirm the existence of this turn over in the power spectrum of .",
    "the structure function ( sf hereafter ) is defined as ,    @xmath97    where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the variance and auto - covariance at lag @xmath100 of the light curve ( equation  a4 in simonetti , cordes & heeschen , 1985 ) . for a given light curve ,",
    "it is usually estimated by ,    @xmath101^{2},\\ ] ]    ( equation  a8 in simonetti , cordes & heeschen , 1985 ) .",
    "the sf gives a measure of the mean difference in the flux of two light curve points , as a function of their time separation ( lag ) @xmath100 .",
    "there is a simple correspondence between the sf and the power spectrum : when @xmath102 then @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , if the power spectrum flattens below a frequency @xmath78 , then @xmath104 in the limit @xmath105 .",
    "the main advantage of the structure function analysis is that the sf estimation is not affected by gaps of missing points in the light curve ( it is easy to show using equation  ( 8) , that @xmath106 , irrespective of the light curve sampling pattern ) . however , it is difficult to estimate the errors on @xmath107 because , as with estimates of other time domain quantities ( eg auto , cross - correlations ) , the sf estimates at different lags are heavily correlated ( much more so than the periodogram points at different frequencies , even in the case of unevenly sampled data ) .    to estimate the sf of mrk  421 , we used together all the orbit - binned ds and scanner a light curves and constructed a single , long _ euve _ light curve of the source ( in order to use the scanner data into an overall light curve , we normalized them to the ds expected count rate as explained in section  2.2 ) . for each pair of data points in the light curve , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we computed their time difference , @xmath110 , and their flux difference , @xmath111 .",
    "let us assume that we have chosen a lag bin of size @xmath112 , and that there are @xmath113 points with @xmath114 in the interval @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "we used the average value of the @xmath113 @xmath116 measurements , @xmath117 , as an estimate of the structure function , @xmath118 , at the lag @xmath119 .",
    "for the overall _ euve _ light curve ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , we estimated the sf twice .",
    "the first time we used @xmath120 day , and the second time @xmath121 month . the first bin value was used to estimate the sf from lag @xmath122 day up to lag @xmath123 days .",
    "we can not estimate the sf at higher lags with @xmath120 day since the individual_euve _ light curves of have a maximum length of @xmath124 days .",
    "consequently , we used the larger bin size ( @xmath120 month ) to estimate the sf at lags @xmath125 months and up to @xmath126 years ( ie the time interval between the first and last _ euve _ light curve of ) .",
    "the combined short and long bin estimated sf is plotted in figure  [ fig14 ] ( filled circles for @xmath120 day and filled squares for @xmath121 month ) .",
    "the estimated sf rises roughly logarithmically with @xmath100 at lags @xmath127 days .",
    "however , at lags @xmath128 days it is relatively flat .",
    "this flattening can not be due to the uneven sampling of the light curve , but it is exactly what we would expect if there is a low frequency turn over in the power spectrum of .",
    "we examine below whether the estimated sf shown in figure  [ fig14 ] is consistent with the assumption that the true power spectrum of is similar to the model defined by equation  ( 5 ) with @xmath129 and @xmath90 hz .",
    "to answer this question , we performed a numerical experiment : we created one set of 1000 simulated light curves using the method described in appendix c of papadakis & lawrence ( 1995 ) .",
    "each simulated light curve has a power spectrum with slope of 2.14 , a knee frequency at @xmath130 hz , and variance as the _ euve _ light curve . for each one of the simulated light curves",
    ", we estimated the sf exactly in the same way as we did with the _ euve _ light curve .",
    "then we computed the expected mean value , @xmath131 , and variance , @xmath132 , of all the simulated sfs at each @xmath100 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig14 ] ( open circles and open squares for the mean short and long bin simulated sf ) .",
    "the  errors \" on the points are equal to @xmath133 .",
    "note that these errors would represent the @xmath134% of the process realizations in the case of a gaussian distribution , but , since the actual sf are _ not _ normally distributed , they can only give us an idea of the real @xmath135 errors of the actual sf and can not be used in the normal @xmath136 estimation . in order to quantify the comparison between @xmath137 $ ] and @xmath138 $ ] in a statistical way , we estimated the sum of their squared differences , i.e. @xmath139 - \\log[\\hat{sf}(\\tau_{i})]\\}^{2}$ ] , for all the @xmath140 for which we have estimated the sf .",
    "we refer to this sum as  @xmath77 \" , although its definition is different from the traditional definition of @xmath77 .",
    "in our case , @xmath141 . based on the distribution of the @xmath77 values for the 1000 simulated light curves , the probability that the _ euve _ light curve of is a realization of a process with a power spectrum with a knee frequency at @xmath142 hz is @xmath143  % .    finally to check whether structure function is consistent with a break at time scales longer than the range suggested by the fit of the power spectra",
    ", we performed a second numerical experiment : we created a new set of 1000 simulated light curves , with @xmath129 , variance as the _ euve _ light curve variance , and a knee frequency at @xmath96 hz .",
    "as above , for each simulated light curve we estimated the sf , and then computed @xmath131 , and @xmath144 .",
    "the results for the mean short and long bin simulated sf are plotted in figure  [ fig14 ] ( dotted triangles ) . at large lag values",
    "the mean simulated sf agrees well with the sf of .",
    "this is not surprising since , as we mentioned at the beginning of this section , we expect that @xmath145 in the limit when @xmath100 is larger than @xmath146 ( @xmath147 s in this case ) . however , the agreement between the mean simulated sf and the sf at short lags is not good .",
    "the @xmath77 this time is equal to 183 .",
    "based on the distribution of the @xmath77 values for the 1000 simulated light curves , the probability that the _ euve _ light curve of the is a realization of a process with a power spectrum with a knee frequency at @xmath96 hz is @xmath148  % .",
    "we conclude that the sf of ( figure  [ fig14 ] ) is entirely consistent with the results from the power spectrum analysis ( section  3 ) ; the slope of the power spectrum is @xmath149 and there is a knee frequency at @xmath150 hz , below which the spectrum flattens ; in fact we found that it is highly unlikely that this knee frequency will be smaller than @xmath96 hz .",
    "all the _ euve _ light curves of show significant variations ( figures  [ fig4][fig8 ] ) .",
    "one interpretation is that they are the result of the superposition of flares whose duration , roughly estimated from the same figures , is about 3 days ; as an example we quote the 1994 lightcurve ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) where the source flux declines for about 3 days , rises for another @xmath19 days and stays steady to the end of the observation ( @xmath19 days ) .",
    "we investigated the variability present in the light curves by means of a power spectrum analysis and our results are as follows :    * on average , the _ euve _ power spectrum of has a power law form with a slope @xmath1 ; * there is a low frequency turn over at @xmath130 hz ( i.e. @xmath2 days , the 68% confidence range is @xmath93 hz @xmath151 @xmath94 hz ) .",
    "we can not determine the shape of the power spectrum below this turn over , nevertheless the data so far is consistent with a flattening of the power spectrum below this frequency to a slope of zero ; * there is a strong indication that the power spectrum does not remain the same , i.e. that the _ euve _ emission of is not stationary .",
    "the ds 1996 observation shows a power spectrum with a slope @xmath152 , which is much flatter than the average slope .",
    "however , this observation is again consistent with a flattening below the same frequency of @xmath142 hz .",
    "furthermore , we performed a structure function analysis of the total _ euve _ light curve .",
    "the structure function of the source flattens at time scales @xmath153 s. based on numerical simulations , we found that the sf is entirely consistent with a @xmath154 power spectrum which flattens to a slope of zero below @xmath130 hz .",
    "we will discuss each of these results in more detail in the following subsections .",
    "our analysis shows that , on average , the _ euve _ power spectrum of ( up to @xmath155 hz ) has a power law form with a slope of @xmath156 .",
    "no periodicities or quasi - periodicities could be found . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that the power spectrum of a radio - loud agn has been estimated in the euv .",
    "in fact , even in the x - rays , the power spectra of radio - loud objects are not well known .",
    "the only exception is pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "its x - ray power spectrum has been estimated in the past ( tagliaferri et al 1991 , zhang et al 1999 ) to have a slope of @xmath157 , similar to the slope of the _ euve _ power spectrum of .",
    "both objects are high frequency peak bl lac objects , and their _ euve _ and x - ray emission are thought to be due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "the similarity in the power spectrum slopes could imply that in addition to the same emission mechanism , the same variability mechanism operates in both objects in the two bands .",
    "hz is @xmath158 ( zhang et al .",
    "1999 ) , when for the normalized amplitude of _ euve _ power spectrum at the same frequency , is @xmath159 ( table  2 ) . ] in general , red noise power spectra can result from a shot - noise model , i.e. from a superposition of random  flare \"- like events , each one with the same duration and shape , and with an amplitude randomly distributed around a mean value . a slope @xmath160 is expected in the case of exponentially decaying shots , consistent with our best fit slope value .",
    "however , the shape of the flares in the _ euve _ light curves of can by eye , be more complicated than that ; they are asymmetric and they do not have the same shape all the times .",
    "for example , the first flare in the ds 1995 lightcurve ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) shows a relatively slow rise ( it reaches maximum after @xmath161 days ) , and faster decline ( @xmath122 day ) . immediately after this",
    "the source rises again , reaching now the maximum after @xmath122 day . even if it is not clear what happens after the maximum ( if there is a second flare or not ) this difference in rise times indicates that the flares are not always the same .",
    "probably , there are flares which rise slow and decay fast and flares with the opposite behavior , or the complicated shapes can be the result of the superposition of consecutive flares .    in general , knowledge of the power spectrum slope alone can not provide us with much information on the variability mechanism that operates in the source .",
    "one has to work the other way around ; develop a model for the variability mechanism , predict the shape of flares , hence the power spectrum slope , and then compare it with the data . even though more work is needed in order to investigate if any model can produce light curves with the correct power spectrum slope , amplitude and low frequency knee , it is interesting to notice the similarity between the shape of some of the flares in the _ euve _ light curves of and those predicted by celotti et al .",
    "the flare at the beginning of the ds 1995 light curve ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) resemble by eye the flare expected in the case of a perturbation with growing thickness in an inhomogeneous jet ( figure  4b of celotti et al .",
    "a different behavior is present in the second flare in the same light curve ; this time the flux of the source continues to be large after reaching the maximum and the amplitude of the event is smaller than in the previous case .",
    "this flare could correspond to the case in figure  4a of celotti et al . (",
    "1991 ) , in which they used different parameters for the stationary jet structure .",
    "the presence of a low frequency knee , with a value that remains constant , within the error bars , in all the _ euve _ power spectra of , indicates the presence of a ",
    "characteristic time scale \" ( @xmath162 ) in the system .",
    "this time scale determines the  memory \" of the system , i.e. the variability mechanism operates in such a way so that , whatever the origin and nature of variations , they",
    " last \" typically for a period which is , on average , equal to @xmath163 hz @xmath2 days .",
    "for example , according to the simple shot noise model mentioned above , the  memory \" of the system is determined by the duration of the flares . if , on average , they last for @xmath162 days , a low frequency knee at @xmath164 is expected . as we mentioned in the beginning of this section , visual inspection of the lightcurves",
    "implies that the flares in them last for @xmath2 days .",
    "the fact that the low frequency knee remains constant implies that @xmath162 is determined by a characteristic of the source that does not change with time .",
    "such a permanent characteristic might be the size of the _ euv _ emitting region .",
    "if that is the case , then an upper limit to the source size at rest frame , @xmath165 , is given by @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the doppler factor .",
    "for @xmath168 days and a typical value of @xmath169 , the source size should be less than @xmath170 cm .",
    "this value is similar to the value of @xmath171 cm and @xmath172 cm that chiaberge & ghisellini ( 1999 ) and mastichiadis & kirk ( 1997 ) find from theoretical modeling of multifrequency energy spectra of .",
    "recently , maraschi  ( 1999 ) proposed the e - folding times scales of 10.7@xmath173 s , 7.1@xmath173 s , and 5.3 @xmath173 s at 1 , 5 and 15 kev respectively for a large flare observed by _",
    "bepposax_. these time scales were calculated from a simple arbitrary exponential fitting to a single event in the _ bepposax _ light curve .",
    "if they represent indeed a characteristic time scale of the system at these energies , then this time scale decreases with energy .",
    "the time scale derived from euv data is 2.6@xmath174 , i.e. larger than the time scales in the x - ray band .",
    "if the time scale is associated with the source size , then these numbers are consistent with models in which the source size is expected to decrease with energy .",
    "a more detailed comparison has to wait for a proper statistical analysis of the x - ray data .",
    "an indication of a break at @xmath175 days is present also in the structure function analysis performed on _ beppo - sax _ 2000 observation of mrk  421 ( zhang y. h. 2000 private communication ) .",
    "assuming that the bulk of _ beppo - sax _ emission is at @xmath176  kev , the 6 times longer euv ( @xmath177 kev ) break could be explained with the synchrotron cooling of the same electron population emitting in the _ beppo - sax _ range .      as is evident from figure  9 and figure  12 , the slope of ds 1996 power spectrum ( open circles ) is flatter than the others , showing the non stationary nature of emission .",
    "the appearance of the ds 1996 light curve ( section 2.2.4 ) agrees well with the power spectrum of that light curve .",
    "the flatter slope of the ds 1996 power spectrum indicates larger amplitude variations at high frequencies , i.e. lots of short time variations , consistent with the presence of a number of short lived flares , and the absence of any long  trend \" in the light curve itself .",
    "changes in the power spectrum indicates that some of the variability mechanism characteristics change with time .",
    "pks 2155 - 304 also shows evidence for non - stationarity in its x - ray light curves ( zhang et al 1999 ) .",
    "has shown evidence of  non - stationarity \" in the past : fossati et al 2000 , in a simultaneous tev and x - ray observation , found that the hard x - rays were delayed with respect to the soft x - rays , opposite to the behaviour previously observed ( takahashi et al 1996 ) . in the context of the shot - noise model , in ds 1996 power spectrum : ( a ) the different slope indicates a difference in the flare shape ; ( b ) the roughly similar amplitude ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) suggests that probably both the number of flares per unit time and their amplitude has not changed drastically during ds 1996 observation ; ( c ) the knee at the same frequency , within the errors , of the other power spectra indicates that the duration of ds 1996 flares is not changed .",
    "+ to the eye , though the flares in the ds 1996 light curve appear to be relatively short - lived .",
    "we speculate that the ds 1996 flares consist of two parts : one with a fast decay / rise evolution , and another one with a much slower evolution , not seen directly in the light curve , due to the blending of consecutive flares .",
    "the extremely large _ euve _ database on ( @xmath178 ks ) offers a so far unique opportunity to study the variability properties of a bl lacertae object at high energies .",
    "we analyzed light curves by means of the power spectrum and structure function techniques ; in a power spectrum with slope @xmath1 we find indication , confirmed by the structure function analysis , of a break at @xmath2 days .",
    "this is the first time that a break in the power spectrum of a bl lacertae object is found .",
    "we also find evidence of non - stationarity for euv emission .",
    "the few existing models on bl lacertae objects variability ( celotti et al . 1991 , chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 , georganopoulos & marscher 1998 ) , developed for multifrequency analysis , try to explain the amplitude and delays observed among the various energy bands .",
    "the single energy approach , as the one proposed in this paper , is at least as promising as the multifrequency approach , but no predictions on the power spectrum and on the structure function shapes ( the most widely used analysis methods to quantify the variability of an object ) have never been derived from any of the current models .",
    "+ it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate in detail whether the model flares that have been computed so far can reproduce the results from the analysis of the _ euve _ light curves of and we reserve this for a future paper .",
    "however , such a quantitative work , will be very interesting since it may be able to distinguish between different models that have been proposed to explain the high frequency emission of blazars .",
