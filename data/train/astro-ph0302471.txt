    "the sunyaev  zeldovich ( sz ) effect is a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "it is caused by the interaction of cmb photons and highly energetic electrons in a plasma .",
    "usually , this plasma is the diffuse @xmath3 k gas present near the center of a galaxy cluster . on average ,",
    "cmb photons are scattered to shorter wavelengths in collisions with relativistic electrons , producing a decrement in apparent cmb temperature at long wavelengths and an increment at short wavelengths .",
    "measurements of the sz increment , particularly at its @xmath4 peak , will be a very important probe of the universe s large scale structure in the future ( e.g. birkinshaw ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "however , many diverse effects conspire to make measurement of the sub - millimetre ( sub - mm ) sz increment difficult , including the brightness of the sub - mm sky , the need for stable , accurate instrumentation , and the small amplitude of the sz increment signal .",
    "sz increment measurements are made more challenging still because of other sources of flux in a cluster field .",
    "these miscellaneous flux sources include the butcher  oemler effect , the rees  sciama effect , and gravitational lensing of primordial cmb anisotropies .",
    "blain ( 1998 ) gives a detailed discussion of these sources of flux in galaxy clusters , and comes to the conclusion that none of these effects produces a signal strong enough to compete with the sz increment in galaxy clusters .",
    "however , source confusion can play a large part in increasing the danger of erroneous measurements .",
    "the term source confusion is used to describe the variance in flux observed in a map due to unresolved , faint sources in the field , the level of which depends on the resolution of the telescope and the background source number count in the observational passband . while it is true that sub - mm emission from within an x - ray cluster is rare , background sources at higher redshift , @xmath5 , are common and relatively bright .",
    "this means that source confusion is inevitable in a cluster field , and may mimic the sz effect .",
    "the effect of source confusion may be compounded many times by gravitational lensing , which brightens high @xmath5 background sources behind a cluster .",
    "this paper evaluates the effect of gravitational lensing and its contribution to source confusion in sub - mm measurements of the sz effect .",
    "we are engaged in a program to measure the sz increment in x - ray bright clusters with the sub - millimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "we wish to determine the confusion limit of these measurements so that we can design a statistically valid observing program , and additionally to determine if gravitational lensing of background sources by the target cluster will worsen the confusion limit or bias our estimate of the size of the effect .",
    "a preliminary description of the measurements themselves is found in zemcov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , hereafter paper .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations of scuba observations of galaxy clusters including lensing and a realistic source model .",
    "blain ( 1998 ) has studied this problem previously , but was forced to model galaxy formation and evolution using optical and infra - red source counts since observationally determined sub - mm background source counts were not available .",
    "further , blain ( 1998 ) considers only single pixel measurements of the sz effect while we use the high resolution available with scuba to identify point sources and remove them from analysis .",
    "a standard @xmath6 cosmology is assumed ( bennett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) , and all errors are 1-@xmath7 unless otherwise stated .",
    "in order to realistically simulate the effect of gravitational lensing on source confusion , accurate source counts are required .",
    "borys et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have analyzed sub - mm hdf data and conclude that the number of sources with amplitudes greater than flux @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is    @xmath10    with @xmath11 mjy , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 deg@xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the scuba background sources are at most weakly clustered on scales relevant to this experiment .",
    "this means that a poisson distribution of sources uniformly and randomly distributed in a field is fully consistent with the data .    because equation ( 1 ) yields cumulative counts , we take its numerical derivative . for each amplitude bin ,",
    "a poisson distribution with mean equal to the number of sources in that bin is used to give a random number of sources for each amplitude bin consistient with the source counts . a random number from a uniform distribution ranging between the limits of the relevant amplitude bin is added to each of the source amplitudes to randomize the source strengths .",
    "this procedure produces an ensemble of random source strengths in the range @xmath16 mjy to @xmath17 mjy .",
    "each point source amplitude is then associated with a uniformly distributed random position in the field . the simulated map created in this way",
    "is referred to as a ` background ' field and is statistically the same as a sub - mm field observed at random in the sky .",
    "because scuba sources are all likely to be background objects , they will all be lensed to some extent when observed in the region of a foreground cluster .",
    "our gravitational lensing algorithm is based on that used in newbury & spiteri ( 2002 ) , and the parameteric lensing model utilized in this experiment is the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "if @xmath18 is the position of the point source in the source plane in arcsec , @xmath19 is the position of the lensed image in the deflector plane in arcsec , @xmath20 is the distance between the source and the deflector , @xmath21 is the distance to the source , and @xmath7 is the velocity dispersion of the deflector in km s@xmath22 , then the lensing model is    @xmath23    the numerical values @xmath24 and @xmath25 have the units arcsec and km s@xmath22 respectively . note that because the sis model is spherically symmetric , changes in the apparent position of the sources must be radial .",
    "the distances are comoving distances determined via integration over redshift using the standard cosmology mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath7 are chosen to be the experimentally determined values for cl @xmath27 ( see table @xmath28 ) , as it is one of the clusters studied in paper .",
    "although a relatively simple model , the sis quite accurately parametrizes gravitational lensing by spherical mass distributions .    the distance parameters in equation ( @xmath29 )",
    "are computed using @xmath30 in our simulations .",
    "we can assume all sources are in a plane at one redshift because the @xmath5 dependence of the lens equation and the effect of cosmological dimming approximately cancel above @xmath31 , effectively producing a @xmath29 dimensional lensing background .",
    "the redshifts of the background scuba sources are not known , and so an estimate for @xmath32 must be made .",
    "it is thought that they reside in the range @xmath33 , with a peak number density between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . because the increase due to gravitational lensing is approximately constant above @xmath31 and the sources redshifts are not known , simulations using a constant source redshift of @xmath36 are the same as those using a redshift of @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",

    "( 1995 ) +    as well as shifting an image s location , lensing amplifies the flux of the background sources . the sis is used to analytically determine radial change and amplification as a function of initial position for each source in the background field ; the map produced in this way is referred to as a ` lensed ' map .    to simulate the telescope s response to a group of point sources",
    "properly , the lensed map is convolved with a gaussian beam with the same fwhm as the jcmt .",
    "if desired , an sz effect signal can be inserted into the map at this point .",
    "additionally , point sources greater than a given flux limit may be removed from the field at this stage .",
    "this map is referred to as a ` convolved ' field , or as a ` convolved and cleaned ' field .",
    "scuba measurements are differenced in order to minimize the effects of emission from the atmosphere and the telescope itself . in order to properly simulate a differential instrument s response to the sky",
    ", it is necessary for simulated maps to be sampled in the same way as the sky is in an actual measurement .",
    "real scuba pointing data ( taken from a @xmath41 hour integration in paper ) is played across the convolved field .",
    "random noise equal to that of a real observation is added to the time stream ; data from bolometers made noisy by this process are removed from subsequent analysis .",
    "a matrix inversion method is used to produce a seven pixel ` map ' of the data ( this method is discussed in wright , hinshaw & bennett ( 1996 ) ) . in this map",
    ", the @xmath42th pixel gives the average value of the map in an annulus with outer radius @xmath43 arcsec and inner radius @xmath44 arcsec .",
    "this binning can be applied to sz data as the sz effect intensity distribution is spherically symmetric to first order .",
    "a singuar value decomposition ( svd ) method is used to invert the matrix ( press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ) .",
    "an example of data points determined via this method is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath28 .",
    "commonly , an isothermal @xmath45 model , given by equation ( @xmath41 ) , is used to describe sz effect intensity distributions .",
    "if @xmath46 is the sz increment flux at angular distance @xmath47 from the centre of the cluster , @xmath48 is the central increment value , and @xmath49 and @xmath45 are parameters characterizing the cluster , then    @xmath50    in our simulations , the characteristic values are taken to be @xmath51 arcsec and @xmath52 .",
    "these are representative of values one finds in observations of clusters ( e.g.  reese et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "a flux density , @xmath48 , which corresponds to the flux of a point source in the central bolometer is recorded .",
    "a generalized @xmath53 must be used to characterize the goodness of fit , as the data points determined via svd are heavily correlated . if @xmath54 are the model points , @xmath55 are the data points , and @xmath56 is the correlation matrix found in the svd , then    @xmath57    the isothermal @xmath45 profile is fit to the data points and the amplitude @xmath48 and @xmath53 of the fit is recorded .",
    "the amplitude information allows us to understand the source confusion we expect , while the @xmath53 statistic is a gauge of how well the isothermal @xmath45 profile describes our data .",
    "a good fit is characterized by a @xmath53 approximately equal to the number of degrees of freedom in our fit , namely @xmath58 .",
    "an example of a isothermal @xmath45 profile fit to simulated data is shown in fig .",
    "because the data set consists of differences , it is insensitive to the mean brightness . fitting an isothermal @xmath45 profile is therefore a two parameter fit for the baseline and amplitude .      this simulation process is repeated @xmath59 times to build a statistical understanding of the source confusion we expect in a typical observation of a cluster .",
    "@xmath29a shows the best fit sz amplitude and @xmath60 for @xmath61 simulations of observations of unlensed background fields .",
    "@xmath29b shows the inferred sz amplitudes obtained in @xmath62 simulations of observations of gravitationally lensed fields produced as described above . from these figures",
    ", it can be observed that gravitationally lensed cluster fields often yield larger sz fits than unlensed fields do .",
    "however , a very large @xmath53 accompanies a gravitationally lensed field s larger amplitude , vastly increasing the likelihood that the fit would be rejected .",
    "this is because the lensed source appears at the einstein ring , not at the cluster centre .",
    "@xmath29c shows @xmath61 simulations of observations of gravitationally lensed fields with sources greater than @xmath63 mjy removed .",
    "this is approximately the 3-@xmath7 level for one night s observing . in order to avoid biasing our analysis scheme",
    ", we remove sources greater than @xmath63 mjy in the target beam , and greater than @xmath64 mjy in the off - source beam . in the scuba double difference",
    "there is one target position and two off - source positions in any given observation , with the array integrating on each off - source position for half as long as it does on the target position .",
    "thus , a point source in either of the off - source positions will be reported as having negative one half its amplitude in the reconstructed image .",
    "this means that a negative @xmath63 mjy point source in a map actually has a positive @xmath64 mjy amplitude on the sky , and could have originated in _ either _ off - source field of view .",
    "notice that removing the 3-@xmath7 detections essentially removes all the high @xmath60 fits from the population .",
    "@xmath41 shows histograms of the @xmath48 from figure @xmath29 in the three cases .",
    "the standard deviations of the distributions shown in the three panels of fig .",
    "@xmath41 are @xmath65 mjy per beam , @xmath66 mjy per beam and @xmath67 mjy per beam .",
    "these do not characterize the widths of these non - gaussian distributions well . we choose to define the confusion limit to be the standard deviation of these distributions after excluding those fits for which @xmath68 .",
    "this @xmath60 cut removes 9% and 11% of distributions",
    "a and c. we calculate @xmath60 based on the detector noise , whereas the variance due to confusion is @xmath69 times larger than detector noise . therefore , we expect this cut to remove 10% of the sources in these two nearly gaussian distributions .",
    "however , 140 of the 400 simulations in panel b are removed by the @xmath60 cut since that distribution has a large tail of positive detections .",
    "the resulting confusion limits are @xmath70 mjy per beam for unlensed fields , @xmath71 mjy per beam for lensed clusters with poor @xmath60 samples removed , and @xmath72 mjy per beam for lensed clusters with 3-@xmath7 sources removed .",
    "the means of the three distributions in fig .",
    "@xmath41 , after the @xmath60 cut , are all consistent with zero .",
    "although not presented as a plot here , it should be noted that including an sz increment of amplitude @xmath48 mjy per beam in these simulations does change their character .",
    "the distributions in the three panels of figure @xmath29 are all simply displaced from zero by @xmath48 mjy per beam .",
    "our simulations show that the sz effect confusion limit of scuba observations of gravitationally lensed background fields is greater than that of unlensed fields if no attempt is made to assess quality of fit or to recognize and remove point sources .    the distributions in fig .",
    "@xmath41 can be compared to the results in condon ( 1974 ) for different values of his parameter @xmath73 , which parametrizes the brightness of the population of point sources causing the bulk of the confusion in a data set .",
    "the blank field distribution shown in fig .",
    "@xmath41a is well described by a gaussian distribution ( @xmath74 ) which shows that unlensed confusion is dominated by dim sources .",
    "@xmath41b shows the distribution from gravitationally lensed fields ; the confusion is dominated by bright sources ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , when bright sources are removed from the gravitationally lensed fields as in fig .",
    "@xmath41c , the confusion limit is reduced to near background levels .",
    "this implies that removing bright point sources allows for a robust measurement of the sz increment in galaxy clusters .",
    "our simulations show that sub - mm sources with fluxes greater than @xmath76 mjy occur in approximately half of all gravitationally lensed fields .",
    "this matches the count rate of bright sources in sub - mm observations of galaxy clusters well : about @xmath77 per cent of clusters observed in sub - mm surveys contain source brighter than @xmath76 mjy ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; cowie , barger & kneib ( 2002 ) ) . for comparison , of three clusters",
    "we have observed with scuba , one contains an approximately @xmath78 mjy gravitationally lensed arc ( scott et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) , and two do not contain sources substantially greater than @xmath79 mjy .",
    "we find that it is possible to detect the sz increment robustly with an instrument having sufficient angular resolution that bright sources can be recognized .",
    "this is because large amplitude gravitationally lensed background sources produce a signal recognizably different from the sz profile .",
    "the confusion limit of cluster fields , once lensed sources have been removed , is @xmath2 mjy per beam , limiting the signal to noise ratio per cluster for the thermal effect to be under ten .",
    "a large number of clusters must be examined in order to obtain a statistically valid survey of cluster peculiar velocities .",
    "the alternative of observing only in excellent weather so that scuba s short wavelength channel can aid in identifying confusion sources has not been examined .",
    "we recommend observing a cluster until the 3-@xmath7 limit for point source detection is @xmath80 mjy . at this point detector noise",
    "will be a completely inconsequential part of determining the sz amplitude ; confusion noise will dominate . not surprisingly , if point source confusion and lensing were not an issue one could detect the sz increment in much less time .",
