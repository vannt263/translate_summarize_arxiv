    "the stability of the lagrangian triangular points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the elliptic restricted three - body problem ( ertbp ) is an extensively studied topic of celestial mechanics .",

    "the 4-th order system can be separated into two independent 2-nd order systems . from these",
    "we can derive an equivalent set of hill s equations @xcite :    [ hill ] @xmath10    where @xmath11 are @xmath12-periodic functions containing the system parameters .",

    "in the following the stability chart of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points is studied using the erm .",
    "a common way in stability analysis is to identify the characteristic roots of the problem that characterize the dynamically different domains of the parameter plane .",

    "therefore the stable solution for some @xmath36 pairs can be realized when the averaged energy @xmath37 consequently , unstable motion appears in the opposite case , @xmath38    since eqs .",

    "in other words , this shows that merely the first hill s equation in eqs .",
    "is responsible for the well - known structure of the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the possible reason will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "accordingly , we can state that the stability chart obtained from eq .",

    "hill s equations can be considered as of two independent harmonic oscillators with periodic coefficients , i.e. with variable frequencies .",

    "the erm applied to the ertbp can be used to identify the secondary resonances between the librational frequencies of the test particle and the primaries motion .",
    "these are the resonant curves on the stability chart defined as a - type @xmath64 and d - type @xmath65 in @xcite . investigating the problem through eqs .",
    "one do not need to involve the two  additional  normalized frequencies coming from ellipticity .",
    "let us consider a quick example .",
    "the a11 resonance in @xcite corresponds to the nearly v - shape boundary line of the stability zone .",

    "the long period of the librating infinitesimal particle along the a11 resonance curve is twice as the primaries period @xcite .",
    "moreover , this rule holds for any a and d - type resonance . if we integrate eqs .   for @xmath68 and plot the sets of parameters corresponding to @xmath69 condition , the stability map with secondary resonances , of types a and d , can be drawn from .    in figure",
    "[ fig : chr_diffpi ] the @xmath0 plane is depicted for various integration times .",
    "panel ( a ) contains the  original  stability chart of librational motion in the ertbp with agreement of the energy plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : en_2pi ] . dark blue curves ( color online , hereafter dark curves ) correspond to the long period motion ( @xmath61 ) while the light blue ( color online , hereafter light curves ) represent the short period ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we note again , these resonant lines indicate the two components of motion around the points @xmath1 and @xmath63 accordingly , the nearly v - shaped dark curves describe the 2:1 commensurability of the test particle s motion , in direction @xmath70 with the primaries period .",
    "the light line represents the resonant component in the other direction @xmath71 along these curves the average energy @xmath72 during one period is zero .",
    "this picture itself does not say anything about the stability of the two - dimensional motion but only the resonant frequencies .",
    "we also need the characteristics of figs .",
    "[ fig : en_2pi ] and [ fig : en_8pi ] to decide whether the motion is stable or not . fig .",
    "[ fig : chr_diffpi](a ) tells us only the border of the stability region .",
    "it has already been shown in section 3 that libration can occur under the dark curve , where both components of eqs .",

    "[ fig : chr_diffpi](b ) . in this panel",
    "two extra lines appear , beside the well - known stability border , corresponding to the 4:1 mean motion resonances .",
    "the plot was obtained as follows : the integration time was @xmath73 two periods of the primaries , the @xmath36 pairs were stored when the energy rate was zero during this time .",
    "now , the _ harmonic resonant curves _ are the new lines and the old borders are the _ sub - harmonics _ of them ( 2:1 res . ) .",
    "this behaviour is defined as _ splitting _ in the erm , where resonant curves split the stability regions into two parts @xcite .",

    "the sub - harmonics describe the 3:1 ( a21 ) and 2:1 ( a11 ) resonances .",
    "in addition two interesting curves appear in panel ( c ) . curve _",

    "in the present work the stability analysis of the ertbp was performed . using hill s equations we showed that the problem can be described as two independent harmonic oscillators with time dependent frequencies .",
    "it was also demonstrated that using this approach , combined with the erm , one can find the same stability chart as many authors published previously .    beside many advantages ,",
    "the energy - rate method allows us to obtain the resonant curves on the @xmath0 plane with arbitrary accuracy @xmath87 ( obviously depending on numerical truncation errors ) .",
    "moreover , it is not restricted to moderate values of the parameters as common perturbation technics .    investigating the librational motion around the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points in the ertbp by two independent hill equations ,",
    "two unresolved problems in stability analysis can be interpreted    1 .",
    "[ fig : en_2pi ] and [ fig : en_8pi ] indicate that the long period component ( frequencies from eq .  ) of libration is responsible for the global feature of stability .",
    "indeed , the a - type resonances are situated in the intersection part of the two stable regions ( long and short period librations ) , they are therefore the backbone of the two - dimensional stable motion .",
    "@xcite showed that there are significant peaks in the unstable domain responsible for longer escape times .",
    "in other words , there may exist some processes that stretches the lifetime of the test particle around @xmath42 and @xmath47 comparing their result ( @xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) with figure  [ fig : chr_diffpi ] , one can see that the longer escape times appear exactly where the resonant frequency curves , corresponding to the shorter frequencies , are situated .",
    "an explanation of this behaviour , based on the present work , can be that the resonant curves in the stable domain of @xmath88 that are actually invisible on the classical @xmath0 stability chart , may partially stabilize the whole librational motion around the triangular lagrangian points .",
    "a direct consequence of this study can be , in future , to extend the investigation to the spatial problem , considering the third equation of motion .",
    "interestingly , the third variational equation beside the @xmath89 and @xmath90 components of is already in form of hill s equation , therefore , only a simple variable change is needed to study the extended ertbp .",
    "the reader may ask why are the b - type resonances @xcite omitted from the present study . since the erm can not be used to identify the exact solution of hill s equations and therefore one can not compare the individual frequencies , @xmath91 ( perhaps the most important ) resonances",
