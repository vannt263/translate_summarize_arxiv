    "vehicular ad hoc network ( vanet ) consists of vehicles ( also referred to as nodes ) , road side units ( rsus ) and certification authorities ( cas ) , whose goal is to ensure road safety and help in secure transfer of message and data .",
    "communication can either be vehicle - to - vehicle ( v2v ) ( e.g. relaying alert information ) or vehicle - to - infrastructure ( v2i ) ( e.g. when the vehicle needs to report some event to the ca ) .",
    "security in vanets is important , because the message sent by one vehicle might have important consequences such as accident prevention .",
    "vanets are a class of ephemeral networks  @xcite , where the connection between vehicles ( nodes ) is very short lived .",
    "the network topology changes very frequently , as nodes move in and out of range of each other .",
    "the density of the network also changes over time , e.g. during rush hours .",
    "these characteristics make vanet very challenging for dealing with security issues .",
    "each vehicle has an on board unit ( obu ) , which broadcasts messages about the position , speed , acceleration / deceleration , alert signals etc .",
    "obu also has authentication capabilities , to verify that an incoming message has been broadcasted by a valid entity .",
    "roadside units ( rsus ) help in coordinating vehicle activities and collect information about nearby vehicles and their actions ( e.g. red light violations ) .",
    "human behavioral tendencies will be reflected in the movement of the vehicles ( rational behavior ) . vehicles ( faulty nodes )",
    "can either start malfunctioning due to some internal failures and give out false alerts , false location and speed intentionally for selfish reasons .",
    "malicious vehicles may also attempt to gather sensitive information about other users e.g. credit card number while interpreting rfid signals at an electronic toll station .    to protect its privacy ,",
    "each node does not use its unique identity ( for example , the electronic license plate ) , but _ pseudonyms _",
    ", when broadcasting data .",
    "pseudonyms are generated and assigned in such a way that a node s unique identity can not be derived by observing two or more pseudonyms .",
    "users can also authenticate themselves using pseudonyms .",
    "current research on security in vanets has been focussed on location privacy , maintaining authenticity of data and revocation of certificates and secret credentials .",
    "surveys on the security challenges in vanets can be found in @xcite .",
    "most papers on location privacy deal with how to assign pseudonyms @xcite , when to change pseudonyms @xcite , and how to assign signatures using pseudonyms @xcite .",
    "authentication techniques rely on signatures , such that a message is signed with a private key which can be verified if a user has the corresponding public key .",
    "a certificate is also issued which verifies the validity of the public key .",
    "signature schemes for vanets have been studied extensively , e.g. ecmv @xcite and pass @xcite .",
    "revocation of malicious nodes is another issue that has received a lot of attention .",
    "the issues are whether to maintain a list of all revoked certificates and keys or revoked vehicles or some seed of the revoked vehicles @xcite .",
    "revocation of certificates and secret credentials has the following disadvantages . the certificate revocation list ( crl ) containing all the certificates of revoked vehicles , has to be sent to all the nodes in the network .",
    "this approach requires a huge bandwidth , if the number of revoked nodes is high .",
    "next , revocation may not be necessary if a vehicle misbehaved only once for some selfish reason .",
    "in this paper we assume that nodes misbehave mostly because of selfish reasons , to reach their destinations faster .",
    "for example , vehicle might send false report on congestion , accident or road block .",
    "it is conceivable to believe that a vehicle does not have malicious intentions of causing accidents .",
    "each vehicle normally sends valid and useful information . if all the certificates are revoked then useful information sent will be ignored .",
    "therefore we argue that we do not need to classify vehicles according to their overall behavior , but instead to distinguish between correct and false information received from a vehicle .",
    "for example , how to verify the report about an approaching vehicle ( possible emergency vehicle ) ?",
    "therefore , it is important to identify false data and the sender efficiently , because a delay of even one second might cause traffic accident .",
    "this problem is termed as _ data - centric misbehavior detection _",
    "in contrast to entity - centric misbehavior detection , where the main goal is to find out and penalize a misbehaving node .",
    "the idea of data - centric misbehavior detection stems from raya s work @xcite on data - centric trust , where the author considers trust on information rather than on the source of information . in our approach",
    ", we do not revoke nodes which misbehave .",
    "instead , the misbehaving node receives a fine , depending upon its action .",
    "it can keep on sending information which might not necessarily be malicious .",
    "the payment of fines would hopefully discourage nodes from sending further false messages .",
    "we will concentrate on detecting false alert messages and false location information sent out by a node .",
    "we would like to detect alerts like emergency breaking , approaching emergency vehicles , road feature notifications , change of lanes etc .",
    "a list of such alerts is given in section [ subsec : model ] .",
    "intrusion detection has been studied extensively in the context of wireless ad hoc networks . however the existing solution approaches are not applicable for detecting malicious behavior in vanets . in section",
    "[ subsec : ids ] we will discuss intrusion detection schemes used for other ad hoc networks and explain why they can not be applied to vanets . in a nutshell , the detection itself is application and scenario dependent .",
    "trust management based solutions are not feasible here because neighborhood may change rapidly and therefore trust relationships could be short lived and difficult to even establish in the first place . in relatively static neighborhood graphs ( e.g. in congested areas ) neighbors may not have history of misbehavior so the first violation can not be automatically detected .",
    "central authority may not be available to facilitate misbehavior detection and penalize accordingly .",
    "the first existing solution to misbehavior detection problem in vanets , by golle et al @xcite , creates a model of the network .",
    "the model of the network is the set of all possible events in the network .",
    "an event which is observed by another node is checked with the model .",
    "if it is valid , according to the model , then it is considered to be a correct message , otherwise false .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that it has not been shown how this model can be created and maintained . for vanets , which consists of several nodes , building up a global database ( as pointed out in @xcite ) can be very expensive and impractical .",
    "another problem is that the scheme does not provide location privacy , which our scheme achieves using pseudonyms .",
    "some solutions @xcite are based on countering sybil attacks @xcite in vanets .",
    "the schemes assume that the precise location of nodes are known .",
    "moreover , these scheme can not detect false alerts raised by nodes . in sybil attacks nodes pose as separate identities and influence the decision of revocation and mds , which rely on majority votes .",
    "since our scheme takes into account individual decisions , sybil attacks poses no threat to the network .",
    "ghosh et al @xcite investigated post crash scenarios .",
    "they compared the expected and actual trajectory to decide if a node is sending the correct post crash notification ( pcn ) alert .",
    "the expected trajectory has been modelled using node s possible behavior .",
    "for example a lazy node might not take any action until it is very close to the site of crash .",
    "on the other hand a risk - averse node might move away very far from the site of crash .",
    "there are three aspects to be noted : the modelling of expected trajectory , the reported position of the node and the actual position of the node .",
    "there are two major drawbacks in their scheme .",
    "firstly , they assume that a malicious node always sends its correct location information .",
    "this is not a valid assumption , because the nodes might send wrong location information and compel other nodes to believe that their trajectory is what is expected .",
    "even a small change in position can make a huge difference , for example lane change .",
    "secondly , the actual trajectory may indeed legitimately differ from the one predicted by modeling the movement .",
    "for example a car might turn right at a crossing or prepare for left turn and change the lane .",
    "these have not been considered by ghosh et al @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose techniques to detect misbehaving nodes and incorrect data , which will also preserve the privacy of the network .",
    "vehicles sent periodic beacon messages , so that the positions of neighbors is monitored over time .",
    "our method borrows some ideas form @xcite .",
    "if reported position is not consistent with the alert raised then the receiving node declares the message as incorrect and discards it .",
    "consider the situation in fig [ fig : congestion ] . at time",
    "@xmath0 node @xmath1 ( with pseudonym @xmath2 ) sends an alert that  road block at location x \" ( fig [ fig : subfig1 ] ) at time @xmath3 ( @xmath0 close to @xmath3 ) its position is past @xmath4 ( fig [ fig : subfig1 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that either there is no road block at location x , or location information of @xmath1 is wrong .",
    "it might do so , to divert the traffic to another lane , to gain easy access of lane x.    [ fig : congestion ]    we address more general types of reported information compared to @xcite .",
    "nodes can send any kind of information , either different alerts or lane changing information .",
    "the other cars should be able to verify the validity of the message content from the subsequent location information .",
    "we also address the problem of verifying the validity of location information reported by neighbors .",
    "if wrong information is detected , the ca is contacted via the nearest rsu .",
    "ca knows the mapping of the pseudonym to the actual node i d of the misbehaving node .    convicted vehicle is not revoked .",
    "instead , ca imposes a fine on it .",
    "since the nodes change their pseudonyms on a regular basis , it might not be possible to link the alert message sent and the location information as coming from the same vehicle .",
    "we therefore impose the restriction on the lifetime of pseudonyms .",
    "there should be a certain time interval after sending an alert message , before the pseudonym can be changed .      1 .",
    "we propose a new model of vanet where we assume that most misbehaviors arise out of selfish motives .",
    "however , our model can also handle misbehavior from malicious nodes .",
    "2 .   we do not revoke misbehaving nodes , but impose fines on them .",
    "this reduces the communication and computation costs in calculating , transmitting , and storing certificate revocation lists .",
    "misbehavior is detected by observing alerts raised by a node and its subsequent action .",
    "our approach does not rely on voting schemes and group associations .",
    "therefore it is immune to sybil attacks .",
    "false location information can be detected in addition to detecting false alert messages .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : related ] we present related work on vanet security .",
    "we discuss the limitations of existing mds in vanets in section [ sec : existing_mds ] .",
    "our network model , definitions and notations are presented in section [ sec : model_def_not ] .",
    "we present our misbehavior detection scheme in section [ sec : mds ] .",
    "we discuss the limitations of our scheme in section [ sec : limitations ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we discuss security and privacy issues in vanets .",
    "we then discuss existing intrusion detection schemes in general ad hoc networks and explain why the are not a good option for misbehavior detection in vanets .",
    "security and privacy in vanets involve the following important issues : authentication , location privacy , misbehavior detection and revocation . amongst these authentication",
    ", location privacy and revocation has received a lot of attention . in this section",
    "we give a brief overview of the existing work on these three issues .",
    "authentication is done using two techniques : 1 ) group signature schemes and 2 ) pseudonyms .",
    "pseudonyms also help in privacy protection . in a signature scheme , each user",
    "is given a private key , with which it signs the message .",
    "each user can construct the public keys of all the users .",
    "when another user receives the signed message , it can verify the signature and check the authenticity of the message .",
    "group signatures were introduced by chaum and van heyst @xcite to provide anonymity to the signers .",
    "boneh et al @xcite suggested the use of group signatures in vehicular networks .",
    "group signatures @xcite can be applied to sign message in vanets , so that , when another vehicle receives the message , it can only check the authenticity of the message , with no means to track the node who sent it .",
    "although these schemes provide authentication , conditional anonymity and non - repudiation , they result in large revocation costs .",
    "since groups can change very frequently in a city network , this scheme is not so practical .",
    "the existence of a single identity poses a great threat to the privacy of a user .",
    "a user s movement can be easily tracked .",
    "it is also possible to trace the personal details of the user .",
    "for this reason each vehicle is given a set of aliases which are called _ pseudonyms _ and a unique identity .",
    "the unique identity is known only to the user and a certified authority which issues the pseudonyms .",
    "any other node or rsu only knows the pseudonym .",
    "the pseudonyms are generated in a way that the identity of the node can not be obtained from the pseudonyms .",
    "a vehicle can also have multiple public / private key pairs , corresponding to each pseudonym .",
    "this concept of + pseudonyms was introduced by hubaux et al @xcite and has gained a lot of attention .",
    "pseudonyms were used in authentication in @xcite .",
    "calandriello et al @xcite used a hybrid scheme using pseudonyms and group signatures for authentication .",
    "pseudonyms are changed from time to time to preserve location privacy . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors point out that the pseudonyms should be changed only in the _",
    "mix zones_. mix zones are areas where nodes can not be observed , either by another node or by a rsu .",
    "the problem with this approach is that if there is only one node in a mix - zone and it changes its pseudonym , then it is clear that the two pseudonyms belong to the same node .",
    "however , if there are more than one vehicle in the mix zone and they change their pseudonym , then it can not be easily predicted which pseudonym corresponds to which node .",
    "buttyan et al @xcite show by simulation , how the privacy level is changed using the above approach .",
    "frequent change of pseudonyms ensure higher privacy , but pseudonyms are expensive and often obtained from a central authority .",
    "freudiger et al @xcite give a detailed study about the age of pseudonyms and discussed different parameters , on which the age of pseudonym depends .",
    "sampigethaya et al @xcite used random silent period between the change of pseudonyms .",
    "they assumed that vehicles move in a group with similar speed .",
    "when a new vehicle joins the network with some pseudonym , it waits for a random time before changing its pseudonym .",
    "for example , if two nodes enter the network at the same time and change their pseudonym after a random time interval , then the new and old pseudonyms of a vehicle can not be linked .",
    "another area of vehicular network security which has received a lot of attention is revocation of nodes .",
    "most of the work in this area assumes that there is an underlying misbehavior detection mechanism , that has detected the misbehaving nodes .",
    "revocation can either be local or global .",
    "in @xcite , the authors present a _ local revocation _ scheme using _ leave _ protocol .",
    "the misbehaving node is revoked from the neighborhood , generally by voting .",
    "moore et al @xcite used a  suicide \" mechanism called _ sting _ , in which revocation is done locally .",
    "a node accusing a misbehaving node is also blacklisted by the neighboring nodes , along with the accused node .",
    "this sacrificing behavior demonstrates that the first node is honest .",
    "this scheme can be attacked in the following way : consider the situation in which there is a benign node surrounded by misbehaving nodes .",
    "once honest node issues accusation signal , it is revoked and can not accuse the other misbehaving nodes . also ,",
    "if one of the misbehaving nodes accuses a honest node and is revoked , the other malicious nodes still remain in the network .",
    "a misbehaving node might accuse another misbehaving node and be considered honest by other nodes .",
    "two game theoretic based revocation schemes @xcite have been proposed .",
    "nodes can either vote , abstain for voting or commit  suicide \" .",
    "each of these actions have associated pay - off and costs .",
    "nodes choose the action that maximizes their benefits . a recent work by liu",
    "et al @xcite show the limitations on revocation in vanets using the game theoretic approach .",
    "the above papers assume that the number of neighbors is known which is not the case for vanets .",
    "the ca decides the costs and pay - offs and might not be available all the time .",
    "revocation of nodes means revocation of their certificates .",
    "however , the use of pseudonyms imply that the malicious node s certificates must all be revoked .",
    "this increases the size of the certification revocation list ( crl ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the crl is transmitted from vehicle to vehicle and is therefore require significant communication overhead .",
    "recently , sun et al @xcite proposed an authentication scheme in which the crl size is of the order of the revoked vehicles and does not depend on the number of pseudonyms that the revoked vehicles have .",
    "there has been several intrusion detection schemes for ad hoc networks .",
    "a survey can be found in @xcite . in some schemes like scan",
    "@xcite neighboring nodes monitor a given node .",
    "if the number of votes against the node exceeds a threshold , then the node is evicted .",
    "this will not work for vanets because of the ephemeral nature of the network , there might not be enough nodes in the vicinity of a malicious node to revoke it .",
    "alert based schemes @xcite raise an alert either to the base station or other nodes , if abnormal behavior is observed .",
    "malicious nodes might raise false alerts against benign nodes and jeopardize the situation .",
    "base stations might not be within communication range to analyze the observed behavior . if there are too many malicious nodes in the vicinity of a benign node , they might falsely accuse it , but collectively raising alerts against it . clulow and moore s",
    "@xcite uses a suicide scheme where a node which convicts another node has to sacrifice one of its certificates .",
    "the whole idea of suicide will deter a malicious node to accuse a benign node .",
    "they use a game theoretic approach .",
    "reidt et al @xcite adds the concept of _ karmic - suicide _ which gives incentives to nodes which commit suicide and includes them in the network again .",
    "game theoretic techniques can not be used as is , in misbehavior detection in vanets , because in an ephemeral network , costs and benefits will change over time and vary from node to node .",
    "two questions that need to be answered are who decides these costs and benefits and how these costs and benefits change in the network .",
    "in this section , we discuss various mds in vanets .",
    "we point out their limitations , which motivated us to design a new misbehavior detection scheme .",
    "the first paper on misbehavior detection in vanets was by golle et al @xcite .",
    "the paper proposes an approach to detect malicious data based on its deviation from an existing model of the network .",
    "they adopt a parsimony argument which assumes that an attack involving a few malicious node is more likely to happen than a collusion attack consisting of a large number of nodes .",
    "each event has an associated location information .",
    "nodes observe different events and store them in a global database .",
    "the _ model of the vanet _ lists the set of all possible events .",
    "first , maintaining a global database of events might not be easy for vanets because of the large network size .",
    "a global database can not be maintained by the nodes and maintaining it with a trusted authority might make it time consuming to compare the results with the observed values . even if only the local information is maintained in the database , it has to be changed from time to time as nodes enter and leave the neighborhood .",
    "maintaining such a database means that entries have to be added and deleted frequently which is not effective .",
    "second , golle s scheme can not provide privacy by change of pseudonyms .",
    "if pseudonyms are allowed , the size of the database increases drastically , because each node can have several representations .",
    "also , there might not be enough data gathered for a node having a certain pseudonym .",
    "sybil attack @xcite pose a great threat to vanets . in a sybil attack",
    ", a malicious node creates several false identities and poses as multiple vehicles .",
    "false information reported by such a node will be convincing to the rest of the network , because it appears that several entities agree with the information .",
    "this can be very damaging where a false information might lead to accidents . since currently most malicious detection algorithms and revocation schemes use majority or voting ,",
    "sybil attack becomes a serious problem in vanets .",
    "there has been several papers to counteract sybil attacks in vanets . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a scheme called privacy - preserving detection of abuses of pseudonym p@xmath5dap . in p@xmath5dap",
    ", there is a large pool of pseudonyms .",
    "there are two hash functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are called coarse grained and fine grained hash functions respectively .",
    "each pseudonym has a fine grained hash value @xmath8 and a coarse grained hash value @xmath9 .",
    "( @xmath10 is the pseudonym and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are keys which are used from freshness ) .",
    "the fine grained hash value of all the pseudonyms of a node are the same .",
    "any two fine grained hash value of pseudonym belonging to different nodes is different .",
    "when a rsu ( referred in the paper as road - side boxes ) receives a message , it notes the pseudonym that was used to sign the message . if there are two pseudonyms that hash to the same course grained value , then either they are from the same vehicle ( which has several entities ) or from different vehicles which hash to the same coarse grained value .",
    "the rsu sends these values to the ca , which checks the fine grained values to see if the same message was send by a node with multiple entities or from several nodes .",
    "in this way sybil attack is detected .",
    "if more than one set of coarse grained values are present , then all these are send to the ca , which verifies if there is a sybil attack .",
    "the scheme can be used to detect collusion attacks of size less than some threshold , @xmath13 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath14 coarse grained values , then the rsu sends the pseudonyms of the corresponding hash values to the ca , which checks if they are from the same nodes .",
    "the scheme assumes that the misbehaving vehicles are within the reach of some rsu , which is not a valid assumption .",
    "since the scheme relies on collecting evidence from several nodes and calculating all hash values , the detection can take as much as 200 seconds ( as stated in the simulation results )",
    ". this might be too unrealistic in practical situation where prompt action might be needed to prevent a crash . no action is taken against compromised rsus .",
    "xiao et al @xcite which use signal strength to detect sybil attacks , suffers from the defect that a sybil node might use different signal strength to send different messages and will not be detected .",
    "in @xcite , the rsu assigns certified time - stamps to all vehicles that pass by it . when a message is sent out by a node , a series of recent time stamp certificates are also send out .",
    "it can be assumed that two or more nodes can not pass the same rsu at the same time for several times .",
    "so , if the same series of time stamps are observed for two or more nodes , then it can be assumed that the node is a sybil node .",
    "a malicious node might change the time stamps and send different time stamps for different identities that it has faked , and avoid being detected as a sybil node .",
    "raya et al @xcite proposed a scheme to detect and revoke malicious nodes .",
    "each node has several pseudonyms .",
    "corresponding to each pseudonym , there is one public / private key pair and a certificate issued by the ca . to revoke a node ,",
    "its certificates are revoked .",
    "their scheme consists of three components : ( 1 ) revocation of trusted component ( rtc ) , ( 2 ) a misbehavior detection system ( mds ) , and ( 3 ) a local revocation protocol by voting evaluators(leave ) .",
    "the mds system observes the behavior of a node and compares it with the average behavior .",
    "this is done using entropy .",
    "if @xmath10 is the probability that node @xmath15 is an attacker , then the entropy @xmath16 , ( where @xmath17 is the number of nodes in the network ) will be low if few nodes behave differently and will be high if many nodes behave differently .",
    "the @xmath18-means clustering algorithm @xcite is then used to find out the exact misbehaving node .",
    "is there are many malicious nodes , then the benign nodes will be convicted .",
    "the leave protocol evicts the certificates of a node , if the number of accusations is above a certain threshold .",
    "since the nodes change their pseudonyms , there might not be enough evidence against a malicious node if there are too few nodes in its neighborhood .",
    "leave requires an _",
    "honest majority _ , meaning that a benign node must be surrounded by more benign nodes than selfish / malicious ones .",
    "so , the scheme fails when there are too many misbehaving nodes around a benign node .",
    "moore et al @xcite propose a scheme stinger for faster exclusion of misbehaving nodes .",
    "stinger is faster than leave , however , leave has a lower false positive rate .",
    "this means that it revokes fewer benign nodes than stinger .",
    "stinger works as follows : when a benign node @xmath19 detects a bad node @xmath20 , then it broadcasts a @xmath21 .",
    "all node near @xmath19 blacklists both the nodes @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "any message from @xmath20 and @xmath19 is disregarded .",
    "however , they can still receive and forward messages .",
    "when the nodes are within the reach of rsu , they are evicted altogether . the disadvantage with stinger is that many benign nodes can be ignored to evict one bad node , as has already been pointed out by the authors .",
    "if several bad nodes are present in the vicinity of a benign node , then this method becomes ineffective .    a recent paper by ghosh et al @xcite detects the root - cause of a misbehavior , in order to determine the future action to be taken .",
    "they address post - crash notifications ( pcn ) , where nodes send false information about a pcn alert , after an accident has taken place .",
    "the malicious node might either send a crash alert , even if there is no crash and not send a crash alert , even if there is a crash .",
    "this situation has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on the deviation of the actual trajectory from the expected trajectory .",
    "for this reason , the trajectory of the node sending out the alert is divided into predefined sample points .",
    "the node s location is sensed at these sample points .",
    "the expected trajectory is calculated and compared against the sensed trajectory .",
    "depending upon the deviation from the expected values , the type of misbehavior can be detected .",
    "there are several issues to consider in this approach .",
    "the change of pseudonyms during the estimation of the deviations , might affect the results .",
    "if the pseudonyms are not changed regularly , then privacy will be violated .",
    "more importantly , it is assumed that the nodes send correct locations .",
    "however , if the misbehaving nodes send their location in beacons , then a malicious node might send false location information at different sampling points and might go undetected .",
    "in this section we present our model , definitions and notations which we use throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "the network consists of a set @xmath22 nodes of @xmath23 nodes , a set of rsus , @xmath24 , and a set of cas , @xmath25 .",
    "vehicles are denoted by @xmath26 ( also called nodes ) , road side units ( rsu ) by @xmath27 and certification authorities ( ca ) @xmath28 and a master authority ma .",
    "we assume a _ one way traffic network , consisting of three lanes_.    the ma is headed by the government of a state or province .",
    "its authority is divided into several smaller regions each having a local authority named ca .",
    "the cas are government agencies that maintain records of vehicles and their owners , and issue unique identities as license plates and secret credentials like pseudonyms , public / private keys and certificates .",
    "we use the authentication scheme ecmv @xcite which completely suits our purpose .",
    "it has an hierarchical structure with several cas .",
    "we assume that the cas to be trustworthy and has authority over all vehicles registered locally .",
    "we assume that rsus are much more difficult to compromise than the vehicles .",
    "although rsus are some- times in isolated places , their hardware may present some tampering proof capabilities , making it difficult for a regular human being to compromise it .",
    "this is not true in the case of vehicles , because its owner can drive to an expert just to have the vehicle tampered .",
    "nodes misbehave by sending out false information , mainly out of selfish motives like getting faster and easier access of a road , getting credit card and other confidential information about fellow nodes . depending on their intention when sending a false information",
    ", nodes can either be faulty ( damaged ) , selfish or malicious .",
    "since most of the undesirable behaviors will be caused due to selfish motives , the classification of  good \" node and  bad \" node is not so important as the distinction between correct information and false information .",
    "we will be more concerned with finding out if the message or alert signal generated by a node is correct or false , than if the node is  good \" or  bad \" .",
    "this can be termed as _ data - centric misbehavior detection_. this is different from entity - centric mds , where nodes are either classified as  good \" or  bad \" .",
    "a node can send several types of messages when on the road .",
    "we mainly deal with two types of messages .    1 .   _ alert messages _ that ensure safety of vehicles on the road @xcite .",
    "these include : 1 .   emergency electronic brake lights ( eebl ) , 2 .",
    "post crash notification ( pcn ) , 3 .   road hazard condition notification ( rhcn ) , 4 .",
    "road feature notification ( rfn ) , 5 .",
    "stopped / slow vehicle advisor ( sva ) , 6 .",
    "cooperative collision warning ( ccw ) , 7 .",
    "cooperative violation warning ( cvw ) , 8 .",
    "congested road notification ( crn ) , 9 .",
    "change of lanes ( cl ) , 10 .",
    "emergency vehicle approaching ( eva ) .",
    "_ beacons _ which specify the location of the vehicles .",
    "the alert messages are important to send safety information , so that actions can be taken and accidents can be prevented .",
    "eebl alerts that a vehicle is decelerating rapidly , so that the rear vehicles can prevent rear - end collisions .",
    "pcn alerts are sent by vehicles warning other vehicles of an accident which has already occurred .",
    "rhcn reports of road conditions like  slippery road \" or  ice \" or unwanted debris on the road .",
    "sva alerts that a vehicle is moving slowly .",
    "rfn alerts of speed limits near schools and hospitals or a sudden bend or steep slope .",
    "ccw sends information about possible collisions that should be avoided .",
    "cvw warns vehicles about possible violations of traffic signals .",
    "cl notifies when a node is changing its lane .",
    "these conditions are sent by nodes to nodes behind them .",
    "the alert eva might also be sent by nodes to other nodes approaching from behind .",
    "alerts can be either observed or self generated .",
    "for example , a vehicle might observe the road hazardous condition ( pcn , rhcn ) or  school ahead \" sign ( rhn ) or a slow moving vehicle ( sva ) .",
    "alerts can also be generated by the node itself when it is decelerating rapidly ( eebl ) or changing lanes ( cl ) .",
    "the cas know the mapping between the pseudonym used by each node and the unique i d relating the pseudonym to the node .",
    "if there is evidence from the rsu and other nodes , that the node has misbehaved in a given situation , then this is noted and a penalty is imposed in the form of a fine .",
    "this is very similar to the general practice of imposing fines .",
    "the difference is that the decision is no longer taken by an authority , like police and speed cameras which might not be within reach when the event has happened , but taken by fellow nodes or rsus .",
    "the idea of paying fines will decrease misbehaving from regular vehicles .",
    "we will assume , that a faulty vehicle will be condemned in a similar way .",
    "therefore , it is up to the owner to maintain all vehicle s sensors at good conditions and always be aware of what messages are being sent out .",
    "each alert has an associated amount of fine , depending the impact of misbehavior .",
    "we define _ freshness interval _ as the time period during which a message is fresh .",
    "this will vary for different types of alerts .",
    "we denote it by @xmath29 .",
    "the table 1 gives the notations that we follow throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we use nodes and vehicles interchangeably .",
    ".table of notations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      rsus are prone to be compromised .",
    "however , compromising rsu is much difficult that compromising nodes .",
    "compromised rsus can either transmit false messages or convict benign nodes .",
    "a rsu which transmits false messages can be noticed by other nodes , which reports it to the next rsu .",
    "if it receives a large number of such reports over a long time , then the rsu is considered to be compromised if benign nodes are convicted , they are imposed fines by the ca . if the message sent by a node has been modified by the rsu , then the convicted node can prove it using its signature .",
    "we note here that in ecmv certificates are not created by the rsus .",
    "so rsus can not fake the signature on the messages , sent by the nodes .",
    "the nodes can then prove their message authenticity , using the signatures on the messages .",
    "once it is known that an rsu has been compromised , its certificate is revoked using the techniques in ecmv scheme .",
    "we note that the rsus much fewer in number , compared to the nodes .",
    "so broadcasting a crl for rsus will not be expensive .",
    "if the number of misbehaviors observed for a node is very high , then it is assumed that the node is malicious and removed from the network altogether .",
    "we compare our scheme with existing mds schemes in table 3 .",
    "our scheme has all the desirable properties like location privacy , ability to detect false location information and immunity against sybil attacks .    in our scheme",
    "we have used ecmv @xcite for authentication which fits into the hierarchical structure of our network .",
    "the transmission delay is only @xmath30 ( as stated in @xcite ) .",
    "the time taken for certificate verification is @xmath31ms and for signature verification is @xmath32 .",
    "( @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36ms ) .",
    "according to our algorithm , there is no extra communication overhead for revocation list , because only the identity of the misbehaving node is sent to the nearest rsu .",
    "the other nodes need not check any crl list before then send their message .",
    "the message transmitted is simply the negation of the transmitted message which involves the same cost .",
    "since crl is not needed in our scheme , communication overhead is greatly reduced as compared to other schemes . in fig",
    "[ fig : compare ] , we show the communication overhead incurred by different schemes .",
    "we consider the hybrid scheme by calandriello et al @xcite , ecmv scheme @xcite , pass @xcite and leave @xcite .",
    "we see that leave incurs a high communication overhead , compared with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss certain limitations our scheme and provide possible solutions to the problems .",
    "our scheme is based on calculating distance between nodes , in order to detect false location information .",
    "we have already shown one condition ( fig [ fig : exception ] ) , where a node @xmath1 will not be detected to be misbehaving .",
    "another situation where our scheme will fail to give correct results is when a node takes a u - turn . in such a situation",
    ", it might seem that a node is giving false location information , because its location is far behind the expected location .",
    "it might seem that the vehicle has moved backwards , which means its location information is faulty .",
    "the other situation is when a node is moving on a flyover with loops , the actual distance might be quite different from the euclidean distance @xmath37 .",
    "we leave it as an open problem .",
    "another limitation is when nodes are moving in a group .",
    "one node might aid the other by sending a wrong alert information .",
    "suppose two nodes @xmath26 and @xmath1 are moving together as a group .",
    "node @xmath26 should take a right turn and node @xmath1 is supposed to go left .",
    "node @xmath26 takes the right turn as per its requirement .",
    "node @xmath1 can then aid node @xmath26 by sending an alert like",
    " hazardous condition on right road \" and take the left one as desired",
    ". nodes behind @xmath1 notice the alert and also the subsequent beacon messages and conclude that the alert sent by @xmath1 is correct , following our algorithm .",
    "misbehavior of node @xmath1 will go undetected .",
    "they might then take the straight road and benefit node @xmath26 .",
    "such issues are left as future work .",
    "another limitation is that , since each node retransmits the alert message to the others , the same alert message will be retransmitted by several nodes , using more bandwidth than necessary . how to efficiently handle this problem is left as a future work .",
    "we assume that nodes which sense or receive alerts , immediately transmit them to other nodes .",
    "however transmitting such alerts leads to power consumption .",
    "so , it is natural to ask why would a node be motivated to send out such alerts , when its only goal is to save itself .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to give incentives to nodes which co - operate in transmitting useful messages .",
    "so that , every transmitted message @xmath38 and @xmath39 is noted .",
    "the node @xmath40 is given an incentive , in terms of positive points is it sends out correct information and given negative points , if it sends out wrong information .",
    "the points can be suitably adjusted as providing free service for points above a certain threshold .",
    "we have assumed that nodes move in the same direction .",
    "however , a node moving in the opposite direction can send out false alert message .",
    "such nodes might not do so for selfish reason , but have malicious intentions .",
    "we leave this problem open for future research .",
    "we have discussed the limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes in vanets and proposed a new scheme .",
    "we introduce the concept of data - centric mds , where we are more interested in finding out false information than classifying nodes as  good \" and  bad \" . the main reason for this",
    "is that nodes misbehave mainly because of selfish reasons and need not be classified as  good \" or  bad \" nodes .",
    "our scheme provides location privacy , by the use of pseudonyms .",
    "any node can detect false alert information , by observing the location of the node after issuing an alert .",
    "there is no need of voting and majority decisions .",
    "this makes our scheme resilient to sybil attacks .",
    "so we do not revoke nodes completely , but impose fines depending false message sent out .",
    "we point our some limitations of our scheme and discuss several directions for future work .",
