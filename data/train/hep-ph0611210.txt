    "thanks to the recent triumphs of neutrino physics we know that neutrinos are massive fermions and that they are mixed , i.e. , that the neutrino flavor ( @xmath1 ) is not a conserved quantity .",
    "we also know , with a reasonable accuracy ( some better than other ) , the three mixing angles and the magnitudes of mass square differences @xmath2 .",
    "these discoveries represent the first deviations from the standard model of particle physics that postulated massless neutrinos and conservation of the individual as well of the total lepton numbers .",
    "thus , a new all encompassing theory , sometimes called the `` new standard model '' , should be formulated . in order to delineate a path to it ,",
    "several additional questions ought to be answered . among them , two are the topic of this talk : `` are neutrinos majorana or dirac fermions ? '' and `` what is the absolute neutrino mass scale ? ''",
    "the list below summarizes the methods currently used for neutrino mass determination and their estimated sensitivities .    *",
    "_ neutrino oscillations : _ only mass squared differences , sometimes only their absolute value , @xmath2 , are determined .",
    "the two different @xmath3 values are @xmath4 ev@xmath5 and @xmath6 ev@xmath5 .",
    "this range and indicated error bars show the present sensitivity .",
    "the accuracy will undoubtedly improve soon , particularly for @xmath7 .",
    "this mass determination is independent on the charge conjugation properties of neutrinos .",
    "* _ ordinary beta decay : _ the quantity determined or constrained is @xmath8 .",
    "present limit on @xmath9 is @xmath10 2 ev . the ultimate sensitivity appears to be @xmath10 0.2 ev .",
    "again , independent on the majorana or dirac nature of neutrinos . * _ observational cosmology : _ the quantity determined or constrained is @xmath11 .",
    "the sensitivity is at present model dependent , but probably will eventually reach @xmath10 0.1 ev .",
    "again , independent on the majorana or dirac nature of neutrinos . * _ double beta decay : _ the quantity determined or constrained is @xmath12 , where the majorana phases @xmath13 are at present totally unknown .",
    "the sensitivity of the method in the near term is @xmath10 0.1 ev , and in a longer term ( next ten years or so ) @xmath10 0.01 ev .",
    "the @xmath0 decay exists only for majorana neutrinos .",
    "note that other , sometimes conceptually simpler , methods of neutrino mass determination can not reach competitive sensitivities . for example , the time - of - flight would use the time delay of massive neutrinos , compared to massless particles , traveling a distance @xmath14 , @xmath15 s , where @xmath16 is in ev , @xmath17 in mev , and @xmath14 in units of 10 kpc . for a galactic supernova",
    "various analyzes suggest sensitivity @xmath10 10 - 20 ev for this method .",
    "the two body weak decays , like decay of a pion at rest , @xmath18 , can be also used if the muon energy is determined . in that case @xmath19 .",
    "however , since this is a difference of two very large numbers , the present sensitivity is only @xmath10 170 kev with little hope for a substantial improvement .",
    "the various neutrino mass dependent quantities are related , as shown in fig.[fig_fig1 ] . note that a determination of @xmath20 , even when combined with the knowledge of @xmath21 and/or @xmath9 does not allow , in general , to distinguish between the normal and inverted mass orderings .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the majorana phases are unknown . in regions in fig .",
    "[ fig_fig1 ] where the two hatched bands overlap it is clear that two solutions with the same @xmath20 and the same @xmath21 ( or the same @xmath9 ) exist and can not be distinguished . on the other hand , obviously , if one can determine that @xmath22 0.1 ev we would conclude that the mass pattern is degenerate . and in the so far hypothetical case that one could show that @xmath23 0.01 - 0.02 ev , but nonvanishing nevertheless , the normal hierarchy would be established .",
    "at present , some information exists on the degenerate mass region .",
    "i use this as an avenue to discuss what can eventually happen , and what it might mean .",
    "the results of the wmap mission@xcite ( 3 years data ) , combined with other observations@xcite ( sloan survey and in particular the lyman-@xmath24 forest analysis ) restrict the sum of the neutrino masses to about @xmath25 0.2 ev if all the data are combined . on the other hand ,",
    "a recently claimed ( and as yet unconfirmed ) discovery of the @xmath0 decay@xcite would indicate that @xmath22 0.4 ev . putting these two indications together@xcite suggests an inconsistency as shown in fig.[fig_fig2 ] .    leaving aside the all important question whether the @xmath0 decay experimental evidence will withstand further scrutiny and whether the cosmological constraints are reliable and model independent , let us discuss possible scenarios suggested by the comparison illustrated in fig.[fig_fig2 ] .",
    "what can happen once all evidence becomes available :    1 .",
    "both neutrino mass determinations will yield a positive and consistent result , i.e. , both results will intersect at the allowed band and both will suggest the degenerate neutrino mass pattern .",
    "such results will be relatively readily accepted , even though many theorists do not expect the degenerate scenario .",
    "2 .   future @xmath0 decay experiments will not find a positive evidence ( i.e. , the present claim will be shown to be incorrect ) , but the observational cosmology or / and the study of tritium @xmath26 decay will find evidence for the degenerate mass pattern .",
    "this is the situation exactly opposite to the one depicted in fig.[fig_fig2 ] .",
    "this will be also , albeit reluctantly , accepted and would indicate that neutrinos are dirac , not majorana particles .",
    "3 .   the depicted situation is confirmed .",
    "the positive evidence of @xmath0 decay is confronted with a lack of confirmation from observational cosmology .",
    "what then ? is there a possible scenario that would accommodate this situation ?",
    "the answer is yes and deserves a more detailed explanation . in fact",
    ", this can happen for two reasons .",
    "possibility 1 ) : the @xmath0 decay is not caused by the exchange of a light majorana neutrino but by another mechanism .",
    "hence the extraction of @xmath20 from the lifetime is not possible .",
    "possibility 2 ) : even though the @xmath0 decay is caused by the exchange of a light majorana neutrino the relation between the lifetime and @xmath20 is different than used so far , since the nuclear matrix elements are highly uncertain .    in order to further discuss the point 1 ) above ,",
    "note that besides the exchange of a light majorana neutrino @xmath0 decay can be caused by the exchange of various hypothetical heavy particles in particle physics models that contain lepton number violation ( lnv ) .",
    "it turns out that the confusion about the possible mechanism can occur if the scale of such heavy particles is @xmath27 1 tev .",
    "( smaller scales are already excluded , much larger ones lead to unobservably long lifetimes . )",
    "if the @xmath0 decay is observed , how can we tell which mechanism is responsible ?    generally ,",
    "observation of the @xmath0 decay , even of the single electron spectrum and/or the angular distribution of the electrons , does not allow one to determine the mechanism responsible for the decay .",
    "it has been suggested in ref.@xcite that the observation of the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) could be used as a `` diagnostic tool '' for that purpose .",
    "the discussion is concerned mainly with the branching ratios @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is normalized to the standard muon decay rate @xmath31 , while @xmath32 conversion for the @xmath33 on an atomic orbit of a nucleus is normalized to the corresponding capture rate @xmath34 .",
    "the main diagnostic tool in the analysis is the ratio @xmath35 and the relevance of our observation relies on the potential for lfv discovery in the forthcoming experiments meg  @xcite ( @xmath30 ) and meco  @xcite ( @xmath32 conversion ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite if the ratio @xmath36 is @xmath37 one expects that the @xmath0 decay is caused by the exchange of a light majorana neutrino and hence the decay rate is proportional to @xmath38 . on",
    "the other hand , observation of @xmath39 could signal non - trivial lnv dynamics at the tev scale , whose effect on @xmath40 has to be analyzed on a case by case basis .",
    "therefore , in this scenario no definite conclusion can be drawn based on lfv rates .",
    "in addition , non - observation of lfv in muon processes in forthcoming experiments would likely imply that the scale of non - trivial lfv and lnv is above a few tev , and thus @xmath41 .",
    "the conclusion above , with some important caveats , was reached in @xcite by analyzing two phenomenologically viable models that incorporate lnv and lfv at low scale , the left - right symmetric model and the r - parity violating supersymmetry .",
    "however , it is likely that the basic mechanism at work in these illustrative cases is generic : low scale lnv interactions ( @xmath42 and/or @xmath43 ) , which in general contribute to @xmath40 , also generate sizable contributions to @xmath32 conversion , thus enhancing this process over @xmath44 .",
    "if indeed the exchange of a light majorana neutrino is responsible for the @xmath0 decay , the half - life and the effective mass are related by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a phase space factor that depends on the transition @xmath47 value and through the coulomb effect on the emitted electrons on the nuclear charge @xmath48 and that can be easily and accurately calculated , and @xmath49 is the nuclear matrix element that can be evaluated in principle , although with a considerable uncertainty .",
    "it follows from eq.([eq_rate ] ) that ( i ) values of the nuclear matrix elements @xmath49 are needed in order to extract the effective neutrino mass from the measured @xmath0 decay rate , and ( ii ) any uncertainty in @xmath49 causes a corresponding and equally large uncertainty in the extracted @xmath50 value .",
    "thus , the issue of an accurate evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements attracts considerable attention and in its extreme form can explain the situation depicted in fig.[fig_fig2 ] .",
    "common to all methods of calculating @xmath49 is the description of the nucleus as a system of nucleons bound in the mean field and interacting by an effective residual interaction .",
    "the used methods differ as to the number of nucleon orbits ( or shells and subshells ) included in the calculations and the complexity of the configurations of the nucleons in these orbits .",
    "the two basic approaches used so far for the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements for both the @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 decay modes are the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and the nuclear shell model ( nsm ) .",
    "they are in some sense complementary ; qrpa uses a larger set of orbits , but truncates heavily the included configurations , while nsm can include only a rather small set of orbits but includes essentially all possible configurations .",
    "nsm also can be tested in a considerable detail by comparing to the nuclear spectroscopy data ; in qrpa such comparisons are much more limited .",
    "since the calculations using qrpa are much simpler , an overwhelming majority of the published calculations uses that method .",
    "there are suggestions to use the spread of these published values of @xmath49 as a measure of uncertainty@xcite . following this ,",
    "one would conclude that the uncertainty is quite large , a factor of three or as much as five .",
    "but that way of assigning the uncertainty is questionable . using all or most of the published values of @xmath49 means that one includes calculations of uneven quality .",
    "some of them were devoted to the tests of various approximations , and concluded that they are not applicable .",
    "some insist that other data , like the @xmath54 , are correctly reproduced , other do not pay any attention to such test .",
    "also , different forms of the transition operator @xmath55 are used , in particular some works include approximately the effect of the short range nucleon - nucleon repulsion , while others neglect it .",
    "in contrast , in ref.@xcite an assessment of uncertainties in the matrix elements @xmath49 inherent in the qrpa was made , and it was concluded that with a consistent treatment the uncertainties are much less , perhaps only about 30% ( see fig.[fig_fig3 ] ) .",
    "that calculation uses the known @xmath51 matrix elements in order to adjust the most important free parameter , the effective proton - neutron interaction constant .",
    "there is a lively debate in the nuclear structure theory community , beyond the scope of this talk , about this conclusion .",
    "it is of interest also to compare the resulting matrix elements of rodin et al.@xcite based on qrpa and its generalizations , and those of the available most recent nsm evaluation@xcite .",
    "note that the operators used in nsm evaluation do not include the induced nucleon currents that in qrpa reduce the matrix element by about 30% .",
    "the qrpa@xcite and nsm@xcite @xmath49 are compared in table [ tab_nme ] . in the last column",
    "the nsm matrix elements are reduced by 30% to approximately account for the missing terms in the operator , and to make the comparison more meaningful . with this reduction",
    ", it seems that qrpa results are a bit larger in the lighter nuclei and a bit smaller in the heavier ones than the nsm results , but basically within the 30% uncertainty estimate .",
    "once the nsm calculations for the intermediate mass nuclei @xmath56zr , @xmath57mo and @xmath58cd become available , one can make a more meaningful comparison of the two methods .",
    "[ tab_nme ]    once the nuclear matrix elements are fixed ( by choosing your favorite set of results ) , they can be combined with the phase space factors ( a complete list is available , e.g. in the monograph@xcite ) to obtain a half - life prediction for any value of the effective mass @xmath50 .",
    "it turns out that for a fixed @xmath50 the half - lives of different candidate nuclei do not differ very much from each other ( not more than by factors @xmath59 or so ) and , for example , the boundary between the degenerate and inverted hierarchy mass regions corresponds to half - lives @xmath60years .",
    "thus , the next generation of experiments should reach this region using several candidate nuclei , making the corresponding conclusions less nuclear model dependent .",
    "in this talk i discussed the status of neutrino mass determination , in particular the role of the double beta decay .",
    "i have shown that if one makes the minimum assumption that the light neutrinos familiar from the oscillation experiments , which are interacting only by the left - handed weak current , are majorana particles , then the rate of the @xmath0 decay can be related to the absolute scale of the neutrino mass in a straightforward way .",
    "on the other hand , it is also possible that the @xmath0 decay is mediated by the exchange of heavy particles .",
    "i explained that if the corresponding mass scale of such hypothetical particles is @xmath10 1 tev , the corresponding @xmath52 decay rate could be comparable to the decay rate associated with the exchange of a light neutrino .",
    "i further argued that the study of the lepton flavor violation involving @xmath32 conversion and @xmath61 decay may be used as a  diagnostic tool \" that could help to decide which of the possible mechanisms of the @xmath52 decay is dominant .",
    "further , i have shown that the the range of the effective masses @xmath20 can be roughly divided into three regions of interest , each corresponding to a different neutrino mass pattern .",
    "the region of @xmath22 0.1 ev corresponds to the degenerate mass pattern .",
    "its exploration is well advanced , and one can rather confidently expect that it will be explored by several @xmath53 decay experiments in the next 3 - 5 years .",
    "this region of neutrino masses ( or most of it ) is also accessible to studies using the ordinary @xmath26 decay and/or the observational cosmology .",
    "thus , if the nature is kind enough to choose this mass pattern , we will have a multiple ways of exploring it .",
    "the region of @xmath62 ev is often called the `` inverted mass hierarchy '' region . in fact , both the inverted and the quasi - degenerate but normal mass orderings are possible in this case , and experimentally indistinguishable .",
    "realistic plans to explore this region using the @xmath0 decay exist , but correspond to a longer time scale of about 10 years .",
    "they require much larger , @xmath10 ton size @xmath53 sources and correspondingly even more stringent background suppression .",
    "intimately related to the extraction of @xmath20 from the decay rates is the problem of nuclear matrix elements . at present , there is no consensus among the nuclear theorists about their correct values , and the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "i argued that the uncertainty is less than some suggest , and that the closeness of the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and shell model ( nsm ) results are encouraging .",
    "but this is still a problem that requires further improvements ."
