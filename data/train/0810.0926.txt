    "of even greater surprise are the properties of disordered graphene systems @xcite .",
    "the latest results , both theoretical and experimental , led to the amazing conclusion that there is no localization in disordered graphene , even in the one - dimensional situation , i.e. , when the random potential depends only on one coordinate . in this paper , we show that this conclusion , if taken unreserved , could be misleading . we demonstrate here that a well - pronounced localization can take place in graphene ,",
    "i.e. , there could exist a ( quasi)-discrete spectrum with exponentially localized eigenfunctions remark-1 .",
    "this localization can occur even though disorder can never make a graphene sample a complete insulator , and there is always a minimal residual conductivity ( an indication of delocalization ) . in this paper , the charge transport in periodically and randomly layered graphene structures is studied and analogies with the propagation of light in layered dielectrics are discussed .",

    "the spinor components at the left and right boundaries of the @xmath18-th layer are connected by the diagonal matrix @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the phase accumulated by the wave propagating through the layer of the thickness @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath44 transports the spinor components from the left side of the interface between the @xmath18-th and @xmath45-th layers to the left side of the next interface between the @xmath45-th and @xmath46-th layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the total transfer matrix of a layered sample consisting of @xmath47 layers is given by the product of @xmath48 matrices :    @xmath49      analogous products of matrices have been well studied in the context of transport of electromagnetic waves in layered media ( see , for example , matrices and references therein ) .",
    "to better understand the physics of charge transport in graphene subject to a coordinate - dependent potential , in what follows , we contrast the results for graphene with those for the propagation of light in layered dielectric media ( for more analogies between quantum and optical systems , see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "additional analogies , not discussed here , also exist with the transport and localization of phonons in different kinds of periodic and random one - dimensional structures @xcite .",

    "the signs @xmath62 correspond , respectively , to dielectrics with positive ( right - handed , r ) and negative ( left - handed , l ) refractive indices .",
    "it is easy to see that the parameter @xmath63 plays , in graphene , the same role as the refractive index @xmath64 in a dielectric medium .",
    "it is due to this similarity that a p - n junction ( interface between regions where the values @xmath63 have opposite signs ) focuses charge carriers in graphene , like an r - l interface focuses electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ matrix2-a ] ) ( for graphene ) there is no factor @xmath65 , which determines the reflection coefficients at the boundary between two dielectrics @xcite .",
    "this means that the charge transport in graphene is similar to the propagation of light in a stack of dielectric layers with equal impedances .",
    "in particular , both p - n and p - p junctions are transparent for normally incident charged particles cheianov , katsnelson1 .",
    "this property is readily seen from the analysis of the matrix @xmath66 : at @xmath67 it is a pauli matrix @xmath68 for p - n junctions and unit matrix for p - p junctions .",
    "therefore , a @xmath22-wave is totally transformed into a @xmath23-wave at a p - n junction , and remains a @xmath69-wave at a p - p junction .",
    "another important difference between the transfer matrices @xmath66 ( graphene ) and @xmath70 ( electromagnetic waves ) is that @xmath66 is , generally speaking , a complex - valued matrix , while the @xmath70 is always real .",
    "as it is shown bellow , this distinction brings about rather peculiar dissimilarities between the conductivity of graphene and the transparency of dielectrics .",
    "among the vast amount of publications on graphene , a significant and ever increasing part belongs to papers devoted to the charge transport in graphene superlattices formed by a periodic external potential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is not only due to its theoretical interest but also because of the possibility of experimental realization and potential applications @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , it was suggested that , by virtue of the high anisotropy of the propagation of carriers through graphene subjected to a kronig  penney type periodic potential , such a structure could be used for building graphene electronic circuits from appropriately engineered periodic surface patterns .",
    "here we consider a layer of graphene under a periodic alternating potential @xmath71 and assume that @xmath72 .",
    "two layers , @xmath73 and @xmath74 with thicknesses @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , constitute the superlatice period with transfer matrix @xmath77 its eigenvalues @xmath78 indicate whether this periodic structure is transparent or not .",
    "namely , the structure is transparent when @xmath79 @xmath80and is opaque when @xmath79 @xmath81 .",
    "note that analogous ( @xmath82 ) l - r periodic dielectric structures are transparent at all angles of incidence when @xmath83 in contrast , a periodic array of p - n junctions in graphene has a rather nontrivial angular dependence of the transmission coefficient @xmath84 .",
    "this distinction between periodic graphene and dielectric lattices follows from the difference in the corresponding transfer matrices : @xmath66 is complex - valued while @xmath85 is real .    if @xmath72 and @xmath86 ( symmetric graphene system ) the equation for the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath87 has the form @xmath88where @xmath89 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath90 given by @xmath91although the eigenvalues @xmath92  are well defined for an infinite system , they are also quite meaningful for a sufficiently long finite periodic sample : at @xmath93  there are maxima of the transmission coefficient @xmath94 the transmission coefficient @xmath95 of the symmetric graphene structure is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_3]a .",
    "a similar transmission spectrum @xmath84 exists at @xmath96 in l - r periodic structures ( fig .",

    "note also that , for a fixed @xmath108 , the transmission zones as a function of @xmath109 are very narrow , making the direction of the charge flux easily tunable by changing the applied voltage @xmath110 .    for comparison , the analogous spectra for l - r and r - r periodic structures with @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    "are presented in fig .",

    "one can see there that the transmission coefficients of graphene and l - r structures are similar , and both differ drastically from that of the r - r structure .",
    "a phenomenon similar to the total internal reflection of light can occur to charge in graphene at a non - symmetric p - n interface when @xmath113 are the potentials on either side of the interface )",
    ". however , a periodic set of such junctions is transparent for some angles of incidence @xcite .",
    "this effect is similar to photon tunneling ( frustrated total internal reflection ) in stacks of dielectric layers @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the transmission of charge through a single non - symmetric p - n junction , assuming that @xmath114 . then , if @xmath115 , a total internal reflection occurs at the interface ; however there are ranges of the angle of incidence where the system is transparent .",
    "an example of such an angular spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5abc]a .    physically , the tunneling conductance ( proportional to the transmission coefficient ) is due to the confined states in graphene quantum well pereira , riken .",
    "although the confined states in a single quantum well have a discrete spectrum @xmath116 , an infinite periodic chain of wells , interacting via their evanescent wave functions , forms transmission bands centered around @xmath117 .",
    "periodic l - r and r - r dielectric structures have properties similar to the properties described in this subsection for graphene . figures [ fig_5abc]b , c show the transmission spectrum of l - r and r - r structures with a period composed of two blocks with equal thicknesses and different refractive indexes , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "based on the results obtained for ideally periodic systems , the authors of ref .   suggested that graphene superlattices could be used as tunable elements in electronic devices .",
    "since parameters of such structures are extremely sensitive to the variations of the applied potential it is worthwhile to study the effect of disorder ( random deviations of the potential from periodicity ) on the propagation of charge in such configurations . moreover , this study is of interest by itself because strongly disordered ( with no periodic component ) potentials bring about further unexpected spectral and transport properties of graphene samples , which make them potentially useful as an alternative to pure periodic systems .",
    "a surprising and counter - intuitive result is that a sample of graphene subject to a random one - dimensional potential , @xmath120 is absolutely transparent to the charge flow perpendicular to the @xmath121-direction , no matter how long is the sample and how strong the disorder is@xcite .",
    "this means that in such samples there exists a minimal non - zero conductivity , which ( together with symmetry and spectral flow arguments ) led to the conclusion that there is no localization in 1d disordered graphene systems @xcite .",
    "however , this statement ( being correct in some sense ) should be perceived with a certain caution .",
    "below , we show that although the wave functions of normally incident particles are extended and belong to the continuous part of the spectrum , away from some vicinity of @xmath122 _ 1-d random graphene systems manifest all features of disorder - induced strong localization_. indeed , there exist a discrete random set of angles ( or a discrete random set of energies for each given angle ) for which the corresponding wave functions are exponentially localized with a lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length ) proportional to the strength of the disorder .",
    "obviously , the behavior of a quantum mechanical particle is determined by the type of potential and by the ratio between its values for @xmath123 and the energy @xmath124 of the particle .",
    "bellow , we study the charge transport in graphene subject to a random layered potential of the form @xmath125 three particular cases are considered : ( i ) all @xmath126 , @xmath127 is a periodic function ; ( ii ) @xmath128 ; and ( iii ) @xmath72 , @xmath127 is a periodic set of numbers with alternating signs . in all cases ,",

    "will be addressed latter .",
    "these three cases will be considered in the next three subsections .",

    "[ fig_6 ] shows an example of the angular dependence of the transmission coefficient , @xmath84 , for a type ( i ) graphene sample that contains @xmath135 layers of equal thickness @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "one can see that a relatively weak disorder has drastically changed the transmission spectrum : all features of the spectrum of the underlying periodic structure has been washed out , and a rather dense ( quasi-)discrete angular spectrum has appeared with the corresponding wave functions localized at random points inside the sample ( disorder - induced resonances ) . figure  [ fig_7 ] shows the spatial distribution of the square modulus of the amplitude of a resonant wave function ( intensity distribution inside the sample ) .    for a fixed @xmath124 , @xmath84 , shown in fig .",

    "both consist of randomly distributed resonances ( one in the @xmath109 domain and another versus energy ) typical for 1d anderson localization of electrons and light .",
    "however , there is one fundamental difference from the usual anderson localization : in the vicinity of normal incidence , the transmission spectrum of graphene is continuous with extended wave functions , and the transmission coefficient is finite ( @xmath141 at @xmath142 .",
    "it is this range of angles that provides the finite minimal conductivity , which is proportional to the integral of @xmath143 over all angles @xmath144 .    the mean transmission coefficient , @xmath145 , for different strengths of disorder ( different @xmath146 ) is plotted in fig .  [ fig_9 ] .",
    "as expected , the increase of disorder reduces the transmission and narrows down the angular width of the transmission spectrum @xmath147 .",
    "the zero ( to within the resolution of the plots ) values of @xmath148 at each curve correspond to the angles , which exceed the angle of total internal reflection .      in this case , the results are more intriguing @xcite ( although encountered in usual electron and optical random systems fr - enhancement ) . in this case , the transmission of the unperturbed system is exponentially small ( tunneling ) and gets enhanced by the fluctuation of the potential ( fig .",

    "the behavior of the charge carriers in the graphene system of type ( iii ) is most unusual .",
    "it is characteristic of two - dimensional fermions and have no analogies in electron and light transport . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] by the bold blue line is the transmission spectrum at @xmath72 of a graphene sample containing 40 layers of equal thicknesses @xmath155 and alternating random potential .",

    "( [ resonance ] ) ] ; makes much wider the transparency zone near @xmath67 ; and gives rise to a new narrow peak in the transmission coefficient , associated with wave localization in the random potential .",
    "in contrast to the peaks in the periodic structure , the wave function of this disorder - induced resonance is exponentially localized .    for this case ( iii ) , the average transmission coefficient as a function of @xmath158 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_12 ] .",
    "in contrast to the case ( i ) , the transmission in ( iii ) is extremely sensitive to fluctuations of the applied potential : in fig .",
    "[ fig_12 ] the relative fluctuations @xmath159 reduce the angular width of the transmission spectrum more than four times ( see also fig .  [ fig_13 ] ) .",
    "that high sensitivity makes such a system a good candidate for use in electronic circuits capable of tuning the direction of charge flow .",
    "another striking property is that after this abrupt drop in the transmission , it ( i.e. , the transmission ) becomes practically independent of the strength of disorder in a relatively large range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_13 ] .",
    "the propagation of light in analogous l - r and r - r disordered dielectric structures demonstrates completely different behavior . as the degree of disorder ( variations @xmath160 of the refractive indexes @xmath161",
    "grows , the averaged angular spectra quickly reach their asymptotic rectangular  shape : a constant transmission in the region where all interfaces between layers are transparent followed by an abrupt decrease in transmission in the region of @xmath158 where the total internal reflection appears ( see fig .  [ fig_14abc]b , c ) .",
    "the frequency dependences of the transmission coefficient and localization length have been studied in ref .  .",
    "the features presented above can be explained , both qualitatively and quantitatively , in the framework of a rather simple theoretical approach . it can be shown @xcite that in the short - wavelength limit , @xmath162 the mean amplitude transmission coefficient , @xmath163 , of a sample built of @xmath47 layers , is approximately equal to @xmath164where @xmath165 are statistically independent complex transmission coefficients of the boundaries between the @xmath18-th and @xmath45-th layers , and @xmath166at small @xmath167 , equation ( [ eq . 102 ] ) becomes @xmath168 @xmath169\\simeq { \\frac{\\beta } { |u_{j}-\\varepsilon |}},\\ ] ] and from eqs .",
