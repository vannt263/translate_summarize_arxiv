    "considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the mechanism of prestin - based somatic motility , or `` electromotility , '' of outer hair cells ( ohcs ) in the cochlea , both on cellular- @xcite and the molecular levels  @xcite , as well as clarifying its physical basis that it is based on electromechanical coupling @xcite .",
    "for example , experiments on isolated ohcs have determined load - free displacement  @xcite and isometric force production @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations can be described by static models @xcite . nonetheless , these are the conditions under which those cells do not provide energy .",
    "some theoretical works have addressed energy production by ohcs @xcite by extrapolating from these _ in vitro _ conditions .",
    "however , these analyses do not provide an equation of motion or the dependence of nonlinear capacitance on external mechanical load , the essential features to describe the production of mechanical energy for amplifying acoustic signal .",
    "there are a number of issues to be addressed for describing ohcs in a dynamic environment .",
    "one such issue is the frequency dependence of the motile response .",
    "the amplitude of displacement in response to voltage changes rolls off at about 15 khz under load - free condition , while force production near isometric condition remains flat up to 60 khz  @xcite .",
    "this difference likely indicates that the frequency response depends on the mechanical load , more specifically viscoelastic drag .",
    "another issue is attenuation of the receptor potential by the membrane capacitance at operating frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the membrane capacitance consists of two main components .",
    "one is structural and is proportional to the membrane area .",
    "another is nonlinear component associated with the mobile charge of prestin , which flips in the electric field on conformational changes .",
    "nonlinear capacitance has been described under load - free condition , at which it is expected to be the largest .",
    "since constraint on the membrane area almost eliminates the nonlinear component  @xcite , it could be expected that external load reduces this component and thus reduces capacitive current , which attenuates the receptor potential at higher frequencies .",
    "this feedback would improve the performance of ohcs , particularly at high frequencies .",
    "this effect still needs to be described quantitatively .",
    "previous treatments used either load - free capacitance  @xcite or the linear capacitance alone  @xcite .    here a model is presented for describing the motion of a single ohc under mechanical loads . in the following ,",
    "the basic equations are derived .",
    "that is followed by derivations of quantities that characterize the motile element .",
    "these quantities are determined using experimental values for ohc that operates at 4 khz .",
    "then the balance of energy input and output is examined for those cells under mass - free condition .",
    "the implications are discussed on those cells , which operate at higher frequencies .",
    "here we consider a simple system , which consists of an ohc , elastic load , drag , and a mass ( fig .  [ fig : system ] ) .",
    "this is not to approximate the organ of corti , but to describe an ohc , which is subjected to mechanical load .",
    "this system with a single degree of freedom is described by writing down the equations for the motile mechanism , the receptor potential , and the equation of motion .",
    "these equations are interrelated and they constitute a set of simultaneous equations , which are examined in the subsequent sections .",
    "outer hair cells ( ohcs ) have a motile mechanism driven by the membrane potential based on mechanoelectric coupling . here a one - dimensional model is used instead of a membrane model  @xcite for simplicity .",
    "we assume that the cell has @xmath0 motile elements , which has two discrete states , compact and extended , and during a transition from the compact state to the extended state , the cell length increases by @xmath1 and the electric charge @xmath2 flips across the plasma membrane .",
    "let @xmath3 be the fraction of the motile units in the extended state .",
    "its equilibrium value @xmath4 follows the boltzmann distribution , @xmath5}{1+\\exp[-\\beta\\delta g]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath8 the temperature , and @xmath9 represents the difference in the free energy in the two states , referenced to the compact state . here",
    "@xmath10 is the force applied in the direction of extending the cell and @xmath11 the membrane potential .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is a constant that determines the operating point . here",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are positive because rising membrane potential and decreasing extensive force increases @xmath13 , and thus reduces the fraction @xmath4 of the extended state .",
    "now consider a case , in which the motile mechanism is connected to an external elastic element ( fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] without the mass or the dashpot ) .",
    "the force @xmath10 applied to the cell depends on the elastic elements as well as the conformational change of the motile element elicited to the voltage change .",
    "the elastic elements include the material stiffness @xmath14 of the cell as well as an external elastic load @xmath15 .",
    "assume that at the membrane potential @xmath11 changed from its resting value @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting displacement @xmath17 of the cell produces force @xmath10 on the external spring .",
    "the same force is applied to the cell reciprocally , producing a displacement @xmath18 .",
    "thus the displacement @xmath17 is determined from @xmath19 , where the fraction @xmath3 of the extended state , is changed from its resting value @xmath20 .",
    "this change is expressed by , @xmath21 with effective spring constant @xmath22 .",
    "notice that an increase in @xmath3 , which increases @xmath17 , generates force in the contracting direction and that the maximal value of @xmath23 is @xmath14 .",
    "this force @xmath10 is applied to the motile element in the cell .",
    "this leads to the expression for the difference @xmath13 in the free energy of the two states , @xmath24 notice here that an increase in @xmath3 increases the energy @xmath13 , making a further increase less favorable .",
    "if the system is in equilibrium , @xmath25 and the equilibrium value of @xmath4 is determined by combining eq .",
    "[ eq : distr ] with eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] , in which @xmath3 is substituted with @xmath4 . under this condition , all forces are balanced and no movement takes place .    here",
    "we notice that @xmath13 , and therefore @xmath4 , can be determined for any set of @xmath11 and @xmath3 by combining eqs .",
    "[ eq : distr ] and [ eq : energy ] .",
    "since @xmath26 in equilibrium , the difference @xmath27 quantifies the deviation from equilibrium that moves the cell .",
    "now we examine how to describe the movement of the cell , which has mechanical loads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) .",
    "the system has a single degree of freedom and is described by using length displacement @xmath17 of the cell as the variable .",
    "what is the force that drives the cell ?    let the displacement be fixed at @xmath17 and the state of the motile element be @xmath4 in the beginning .",
    "suppose the membrane potential suddenly changes at a certain moment .",
    "the cell generates force that moves the cell .",
    "the force that drive the cell is @xmath28 if the stiffness of the cell is @xmath14 and if @xmath29 is small enough so that the linear term is dominant . even though the motile element contributes to reduce the stiffness from the intrinsic stiffness @xmath14 , in section [ sec : param ] we confirm that this is indeed a good approximation for a set of parameter values that we use .",
    "then , the equation of motion should be , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the drag coefficient , and @xmath32 the mass .    for a given displacement @xmath17 , @xmath3 can be given by eq .",
    "[ eq : x ] .",
    "since @xmath20 is a time - independent constant , its time derivatives does not contribute .",
    "the equation of motion can then be expressed , @xmath33 notice that a factor @xmath34 drops out from the equation because it is shared by all terms . in the special case of @xmath35 ,",
    "[ eq : motion ] turns into a relaxation equation with a time constant @xmath36 , which is intuitive .",
    "the motile response of the cell is driven by the receptor potential , generated by the receptor current , which is , in turn , elicited by changes in the hair bundle resistance by mechanical stimulation .",
    "this current is driven by the sum of two electromotive forces .",
    "one is @xmath37 , which is primarily determined by the k@xmath38 conductance of the basolateral membrane of the cell .",
    "the other is the endocochlear potential @xmath39 , which is generated by the stria vascularis , a tissue that lines a part of the scala media ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system]b ) .",
    "the magnitude of the receptor potential is determined not only by changes in the hair bundle conductance but also by the basolateral conductance because the electric current through the apical membrane must be equal to the current through the basolateral membrane .",
    "changes in the membrane potential elicit not only ionic currents but also a capacitive current proportional to the regular capacitance in the basolateral membrane .",
    "in addition , they flip the charge of the motile units , produces an additional current , similar to the capacitive current .",
    "thus , kirchhoff s law leads to , @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the apical membrane resistance , which is dominated by mechanotransducer channels in the hair bundle .",
    "the basolateral membrane has the resistance @xmath42 and the linear capacitance @xmath43 , which is determined by the membrane area and the specific membrane capacitance of @xmath44 f / m@xmath45 for biological membranes @xcite .",
    "the apical membrane capacitance is ignored for simplicity .",
    "the last term on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ eq : potential ] is an additional displacement current due to the charge movement in the motile elements .",
    "it has the negative sign because a voltage increase results in a decrease in @xmath3 as mentioned earlier .",
    "as we will see later , nonlinear capacitance appears from this term .",
    "in the following , experimentally observable quantities are derived from the model so that values for the cellular parameters can be determined from experimental data .",
    "length changes of ohcs have been quantified by changing the membrane potential gradually or stepwise while measuring cell length without load .",
    "that corresponds to describing @xmath4 as a function of @xmath11 under the condition of @xmath46 .",
    "thus , eq .  [ eq : distr ] is accompanied by @xmath47 instead of eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] .",
    "this equation has the same form as the one that has been used for fit experimental data  @xcite .",
    "isometric force generation per voltage changes can be obtained by evaluating @xmath48 from the equation @xmath49 with eq .",
    "[ eq : distr ] and @xmath50 $ ] for a given displacement @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to , @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the dependence on length displacement @xmath17 enters through the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the maximum value is @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "the effective compliance of the cell can be determined by @xmath55 for a given voltage @xmath11 .",
    "if we introduce the effective stiffness @xmath56 , this leads to , @xmath57 thus , the minimal value @xmath58 of the effective stiffness is @xmath59 at @xmath54 .",
    "another characteristic quantity that described the motile element is a contribution of the motile element to the membrane capacitance , which is often referred to as nonlinear capacitance .",
    "let us consider small periodic changes with amplitude @xmath60 in the membrane potential on top of a constant value @xmath61 , @xmath62.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the response can be described by , @xmath63 , \\\\",

    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 is expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq : distr ] with @xmath13 , in which @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath65 .",
    "if the amplitude @xmath60 is small , we can ignore second - order terms , eqs .",
    "[ eq : distr ] and [ eq : motion ] respectively lead to , @xmath66 these equations lead to , @xmath67 with constants @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , which respectively characterizes viscoelasticity , resonance , and the operating point : @xmath71    the capacitive current due to voltage changes is @xmath72 $ ] , which should be also expressed as @xmath73 $ ] using a component @xmath74 of the membrane capacitance .",
    "hence , @xmath75 $ ] because conformational change @xmath76 of each motile element carries charge @xmath76 and the cell has @xmath0 such elements .",
    "the membrane capacitance @xmath77 is the sum of @xmath74 and the structural capacitance @xmath43 , due primarily to lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane .    in the following ,",
    "the contribution to the capacitance is examined .",
    "the order is from the most restricted case , where this quantity is better studied , to more general cases .",
    "let us start with the simplest case , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "that leads to the total membrane capacitance @xmath77 , expressed by @xmath81    letting @xmath82 or @xmath83 , we recover the familiar expression for the membrane capacitance of outer hair cells @xmath84 under load - free condition @xcite .",
    "in addition , this expression shows that nonlinear capacitance decreases with increasing elastic load .",
    "that is consistent with intuition that constraints on the cell length reduce nonlinear capacitance . in an extreme limit ,",
    "in which a rigid load does not allow transitions of the motor elements , nonlinear component diminishes .",
    "this expectation is consistent with greatly diminished nonlinear capacitance observed in rounded ohcs with constrained membrane area @xcite .      now let us proceed to a more general case , in which the viscous term does not disappear .",
    "the total membrane capacitance @xmath77 is expressed , @xmath85 as expected , in the limit of low frequency , this expression turns into eq .",
    "[ eq : capk ] . in the limit of @xmath83",
    ", it leads to the expression of the frequency dependence of nonlinear capacitance that was previously derived based on an assumption that transition rates between the states are intrinsic @xcite .",
    "the present interpretation supports the interpretation that the experimentally observed frequency roll - off @xcite of the membrane capacitance is indeed the result of viscoelastic relaxation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the imaginary part of @xmath76 contributes to the conductance .",
    "however , it diminishes in both low frequency limit and high frequency limit .",
    "a similar evaluation of nonlinear capacitance can be performed for a system with non - zero mass , which has mechanical resonance .",
    "the quantity @xmath76 is expressed by , @xmath86}{[1+\\gamma a^2 n \\tilde{k}-(\\omega/\\omega_{r})^2]^2+(\\omega/\\omega_{\\eta})^2 } , \\label{eq : cm - mres}\\ ] ]    under the condition @xmath87 , eq .  [ eq : cm@m=0 ] can be obtained .",
    "it should be noted that nonlinear capacitance disappears and @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , the capacitance becomes quite singular near this resonance frequency as the characteristic frequency @xmath68 of viscoelasticity exceeds the resonance frequency @xmath90 .",
    "a reduction in the capacitance @xmath77 near resonance leads to an increase in the receptor potential because it reduces the attenuation due to the resistance - capacitance ( rc ) circuit in the cell .",

    "those quantities important for determining the parameters are : the amplitude @xmath100 of the load - free mechanical displacement , which is between 4 and 5 % of the cell length , the steepness of load - free mechanical displacement and that of nonlinear capacitance , both of which are characterized by @xmath2 , and the number @xmath0 of the motile elements in the cell , which is obtained by dividing the total charge movement @xmath103 divided by @xmath2 . in addition , experimental values are available for the maximal value of nonlinear capacitance @xmath104 , the axial stiffness of the cell @xmath56 , and isometric force production @xmath48 .",

    "[ fig : small_eta]a ) but it decreases the receptor potential if drag is larger ( fig .",
    "[ fig : large_eta]a ) .",
    "these observations suggest that drag is more effective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that powers the cell s motility .      the functional significance of ohcs as the cochlear amplifier depends on the balance between energy input and output .",
    "energy output from the cell body has been evaluated in earlier sections .",
    "energy input required for stimulating the hair bundle to generate the receptor potential consists of two components .",
    "one is elastic and the other is dissipative .",
    "the elastic component is recovered in the next cycle of stimulation during sustained oscillation .",
    "the work against viscous drag can not be recovered .",
    "therefore the balance of this energy has been considered critical for the sensitivity and sharp tuning of the ear @xcite .",
    "the present model allows an evaluation of ohc s output , which compensates for the dissipated energy for hair bundle stimulation .",
    "examination of force or energy balance in the cochlea , however , can not be made without a certain set of assumptions including the mode of motion in the cochlea @xcite .    in the following , energy balance of a single ohc is examined . for this comparison , output values obtained under the condition @xmath157 and @xmath158",
    "are used so that the two kinds of outputs can be realized at the same time .",
    "the hair bundle drag , which gives rise to the dissipative energy required for input has been evaluated for bull frog saccular hair bundles @xcite .",
    "it consists of external friction between the hair bundle and the bulk fluid and internal friction due to relative motion between the stereocilia .",
    "the former is dominant when a hair bundle is stimulated by force applied to the kinocilium : the drag coefficient of a whole hair bundle is about 1/5 of a single stereocilia @xcite .",
    "if we consider a sphere with a diameter of 8.5 @xmath102 m , which is the hair bundle height , stokes law gives the drag coefficient of 80 nns / m , about the same as the drag coefficient calculated for the bundle in the frequency range higher than 2 khz , where stereocilia moves in synchrony in response to force applied to the kinocilium @xcite .",
    "this value can be even larger if the thickness of boundary layer is added to the diameter .",
    "therefore , the internal drag must be smaller than the total drag at least by an order of magnitude . here",
    "we set 1/10 of the total friction coefficient as an upper bound of the contribution of internal friction .    in the physiological conditions for ohcs , unlike a frog hair bundle stimulated by holding kinocilium , the hair bundle is in the subtectorial space between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina and hair bundles are stimulated by the shear in the gap . under this condition , the external drag disappears because there is no relative motion between the bulk fluid and the hair bundle .",
    "the energy loss in that system is due to the shear between the two places and the internal drag of the hair bundle is negligible .",
    "this analysis is indeed consistent with earlier reports @xcite .    assuming that the internal drag is less than 1/10 of the total , experimental data on frog saccular hair bundles @xcite can be used to estimate an upper bound of energy dissipation .",
    "full gating of frog hair bundle stimulated at 100 @xmath102 m/s with amplitude @xmath147100 nm generates viscous force @xmath14720 pn @xcite .",
    "this value is about twice as large as 80 nns / m for frequencies higher than 2 khz @xcite .",
    "energy dissipation based on this observed force is @xmath159 j / half cycle for @xmath160 hz for full gating .",
    "thus 3% gating corresponds to @xmath161 j / half cycle . if we extrapolate for higher frequencies , @xmath162 j / half cycle for frequency of 4 khz .",
    "since the drag coefficient at 4 khz is less than that at 500 hz @xcite , this value is an overestimate .",
    "a ten - fold reduction of this value leads to @xmath163 zj , which is given as an upper bound of energy dissipation due to internal friction of a _ frog _ hair bundle .",
    "this value is smaller than @xmath164 zj ( @xmath165 j ) with elastic load @xmath146 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : drag_effect ] c and [ fig : energy_balance ] ) , and @xmath91 zj without elastic load ( figs .",

    "a *       * b *     +     the internal friction coefficient of a ohc hair bundle is likely much smaller than that of the frog hair bundle , given the difference in their geometries .",
    "if we assume that internal friction is due to the shear between the stereocilia , the internal friction of an ohc is @xmath1471/4 of that of a frog hair bundle ( supplement ) .",
    "thus an upper bound of energy loss is @xmath166 zj , less than 1/10 of the energy output of an ohc .",
    "even if we assume that the ohc is isolated and subjected to an external drag equivalent to stokes drag for a sphere with the diameter of 4 @xmath102 m , the maximal height of a hair bundle that operates at 4 khz @xcite _ in vivo _ , the comparison indicates that energy output exceeds energy loss by hair bundle drag ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance ] ) .",
    "the observed stiffness of the hair bundle of ohcs is between 1 to 3 mn / m  @xcite .",
    "the hair bundle displacement required for 3 % change in the bundle conductance ( or resistance ) is @xmath1470.03 nm @xcite .",
    "thus the energy required for changing the conductance by 3% is @xmath167 aj in the most efficient condition based on 1 mn / m bundle stiffness .",
    "the elastic energy output obtained from the model is @xmath1472 zj at 4 khz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : large_eta]b ) .",
    "it is 3.6 zj even for small viscous drag ( fig .",
    "[ fig : small_eta]b ) .",
    "this indicates that output energy is a fraction of input energy .",
    "outer hair cells have , therefore , a minor effect in the elastic energy involved in the oscillation of the system . since",
    "elastic energy is conserved it is unnecessary for the output of an amplifier to match the input .",
    "the analysis described above shows that energy output exceeds energy input for an ohc that operates at 4 khz even without mechanical resonance .",
    "more basal cells that operate at higher frequencies are more labile and harder to obtain reliable experimental data",
    ". however , the energy balance in more basal cells , which operate at higher frequencies , is of great interest because it is harder to achieve a favorable energy balance at a higher frequencies and therefore it is important for understanding the effectiveness of ohc electromotility as the basis of the cochlear amplifier @xcite .    if we stimulate the same cell , for example , at 12 khz , a frequency higher by 3 times , the energy output is significantly less .",
    "however , the ohcs that operate at higher frequencies are shorter , with a lower linear membrane capacitance @xmath43 and larger axial stiffness @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the hair bundle conductance is more sensitive to the strain @xcite . if @xmath43 is halved and @xmath14 is doubled , the energy balance is still favorable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance ] ) even without considering a higher sensitivity of the hair bundle transducer .",
    "notice that these comparisons are made without considering mechanical resonance .",
    "the reason for excluding resonance in the present examination is the sharp sensitivity of the membrane capacitance on the resonance frequency @xmath90 as well as the characteristic viscoelastic frequency @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnl ] ) .",
    "since ohcs in the cochlea works close to mechanical resonance frequencies , it is possible that the membrane capacitance in the operating condition is much smaller , enabling more efficient use of electrical energy @xcite .",
    "this issue , however , can not be addressed quantitatively without precise information , such as the values for @xmath90 , @xmath125 as well as the sensitivity of the hair bundle .",
    "in this paper , a simple model for electromotility of ohcs is proposed to describe its behavior in a dynamic environment .",
    "the model is consistent with the experimental data so far obtained from isolated ohcs .",
    "the model also extends the expression for the membrane capacitance , incorporating the effects of frequency , drag , elastic load , and an associated mass . monitoring",
    "the membrane capacitance could be the easiest means of testing the predictions .",
    "the effect of mass will be described in more detail elsewhere .",
    "this model enables description of the receptor potential and energy production by an ohc while its hair bundle is mechanically stimulated by sinusoidal waveform .",
    "it was found that the receptor potential is more significantly affected by viscous drag than elastic load .",
    "the model predicts that the output of elastic energy is less than the input at the hair bundle .",
    "however , the output of dissipative energy is larger than the input . since",

    "<S> the present report is an attempt of bridging the gap by introducing a simple one - dimensional model for electromotility of ohc in a dynamic environment . </S>",
    "<S> this model incorporates a feedback loop involving the receptor potential and the mechanical load on ohc , and leads to an analytical expression for the membrane capacitance , which explicitly describes the dependence on the elastic load , viscous drag , and the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the derived equation of motion was examined in a mass - less model system with realistic parameter values for ohc . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that viscous drag is more effective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that drives the cell . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , it is expected that ohcs are more effective in counteracting viscous drag than providing elastic energy to the system .      </S>",
