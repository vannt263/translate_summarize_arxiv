    "recently , mott transitions in multicomponent systems have attracted a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "they give rise to intriguing and rich physics that does not have obvious counterparts in physics of condensed matters .",
    "the multicomponent systems are realized by cooling neutral atoms , for example , multicomponent lithium at ultra - low temperature @xcite . when these multicomponent systems are loaded into optical lattices ,",
    "they simulate various theoretical models of electron correlations with extensions of degrees of freedom , such as the multicomponent hubbard and heisenberg models @xcite .",
    "the simulations provide a connection between the theoretical studies and experimental observations .",
    "indeed , experiments already found the theoretically predicted mott insulating phase in two - component fermion systems which simulate the single - band hubbard model @xcite . in three - component fermion systems the mott insulating phase still exists at commensurate fillings , and in addition also at incommensurate fillings , depending on the symmetry of the local interactions between the particle components @xcite .    in a parallel development ,",
    "experiments have also realized multicomponent atom mixtures that pave the way to the investigation of the mott insulating states of different particle species @xcite .",
    "this investigation has also attracted a lot of theoretical studies .",
    "various phase transitions have been theoretically discussed for different kind of mixtures , including boson - boson @xcite , boson - fermion @xcite , and fermion - fermion mixtures @xcite . in fermion - fermion mixtures , different metal - insulator transitions ( mits ) , which include collective , species selective , and inverse mott transitions , were theoretically found @xcite .",
    "the finding is based on the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite for a three - component falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) , that describes a fermion - fermion mixture of two - component light atoms and single - component heavy atoms  @xcite .",
    "this model is an extension with odd number of components of the spinless fkm , which exhibits a rich phase diagram and has also attracted a lot of studies @xcite .",
    "it can also be considered as a mass balanced case of the three - component hubbard model @xcite .",
    "one may expect rich phase transitions in the three - component fkm , that reflect the odd and non - equivalent component multiplicity and do not have obvious counterparts in two - component or three equivalent component systems .",
    "indeed , at commensurate fillings both the inter- and intra - species interactions collectively drive the mixture from the metallic to the insulating state , and at the incommensurate half filling , only two - component light atoms are involved in the mott transition .",
    "the species - selective mit is reminiscent of the orbital - selective one , where the narrow orbital band becomes insulating , while the wide band is still metallic @xcite . when the intra - species interaction is weaker than the inter - species one",
    ", the correlations between atom components can also drive the system from the insulating to the metallic state @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "first , in the present paper , the mott transitions in the three - component falicov - kimball model are studied by the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson mean - field approach @xcite .",
    "the previous work has employed the dmft plus exact diagonalization ( ed )  @xcite .",
    "although the ed is an exact impurity solver , it is limited to a finite number of the energy levels of the dynamical mean field and always admits finite - size effects . within the dmft",
    "the double occupancy always remains finite even in the mott insulator state and it can not be used as an order parameter of the mit @xcite . in addition , within the dmft , the dynamics of the localized heavy fermions is complicated to calculate , because it is completely excluded from the effective mean - field single impurity dynamics @xcite . in multi - orbital systems ,",
    "different impurity solvers of the dmft often capture different aspects of the mott transitions , and can partially lead to different conclusions @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to investigate the properties of these mott transitions within a more analytical trackable theory .",
    "therefore , we apply the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson approach  @xcite on the mean - field level to the three - component fkm . our reasonable results not only agree well with the dmft  @xcite but also clarify the nature of the mott transitions in a simple physics picture through the band renormalization factors and the double occupancies .",
    "in addition , the slave boson mean field approximation also allows us to determine not only the dynamics of itinerant fermions , but also the dynamics of localized fermions , that is complicated to calculate within the dmft .",
    "the second aim of the present paper is to show that the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson approach at the mean field level already fully captures the description of the mit in the multicomponent fermion mixtures , and it can even be analyzed in an analytical manner . since the slave boson mean field approximation is quite simple , and its description of the mit is physically intuitive , this approach serves an alternative method of investigating multicomponent correlated systems .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the model as well as introduce the auxiliary boson representation in the mean - field approximation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we present and discuss the numerical results of the ground state in paramagnetic states at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings . finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian of a three - component fkm that describes a mixture of heavy and light fermion atoms loaded in an optical lattice  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for two - component fermion atoms at lattice site @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for single - component fermion atoms at lattice site @xmath3 .",

    "the energy band of atoms in optical lattices can become flat and the hopping amplitude vanishes .",
    "the mixture can be considered as an extreme mass imbalance case of the three - component fermion mixtures @xcite .",
    "the three - component fkm can also be considered as a multicomponent extension of the spinless fkm  @xcite or an asymmetric simplification of the three - component hubbard model @xcite .",
    "it has two well - known limiting cases .",

    "figure [ z_ucc__halffilling_ucf_large ] shows the vanishing of the band renormalization factor @xmath70 of the two - component atoms in weak and strong intra - species local interaction @xmath13 regions .",
    "the boson condensations of the empty and triply - occupied states always vanish , except for the metallic region , where the band renormalization factor @xmath70 is finite .",
    "when the intra - species local interaction @xmath13 is weak , the band renormalization factor @xmath59 of the single - component atoms and the inter - species double occupancy @xmath74 vanish too .",
    "it is the inverse mit , where the intra - species local interaction drives the mixture from insulator to metal . in this insulating state ,",
    "the boson condensations @xmath123 and @xmath124 vanish , while the other boson condensations @xmath122 and @xmath121 are constant .",
    "this leads the inter - species double occupancy to vanish , while the intra - species double occupancy maintains its constant value . with further increasing @xmath13",
    "the mixture is driven to the metallic state by correlations . in the metallic state ,",
    "all boson condensations acquire finite values , that give finite values for the band renormalization factors @xmath70 and @xmath59 as well as the double occupancies @xmath56 and @xmath74 . when the intra - species local interaction @xmath13 is strong , only the band renormalization factor @xmath125 and the double occupancy @xmath56 of the two - component atoms vanish . the band renormalization factor @xmath59 of the single - component atoms and the inter - species double occupancy",
    "@xmath74 reach their free saturated values .",
    "this is the species - selective mit , which we have discussed previously .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the above results are summarized into the phase diagram plotted in fig .",
    "[ phase_half_filling ] .",
    "it shows possibilities of two distinct mits at half filling .",
    "one mit is species selective , and the other is the inverse one .",
    "the phase diagram agrees well with the one obtained by the dmft @xcite , except for the first - order phase transition of the species - selective mit .",
    "the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson mean - field approximation usually overestimates the critical interaction values of the mott transitions .",
    "for instance , for the single - band hubbard model , the critical interaction value of the mott transition calculated by the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson mean - field approximation is almost twice as larg as that obtained by the dmft @xcite .",
    "the two obtained mits occur in different regions of the parameters .",
    "the species - selective mit occurs in the region of strong intra - species local interactions ( @xmath126 ) and the inverse mit occurs in the region of weak ones ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the critical value @xmath128 of the species - selective mit monotonously increases with @xmath14 . therefore at a given strong @xmath13 , the inter - species local interaction drives the mixture from insulator to metal .",
    "the critical value @xmath129 of the inverse mit is indeed linear in @xmath14 .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath130 . for weak inter - species local interactions ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath117 , we can not observe the inverse mit .    within the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson mean - field approximation",
    ", the critical value of @xmath13 can also analytically be obtained . for the species - selective mit , as we have analyzed in the previous section , when the transition approaches @xmath131 , @xmath132 at @xmath106 .",
    "then nearby the transition point , the ground - state energy can be expanded up to second order of @xmath27 and @xmath122 @xmath133 minimizing this ground - state energy with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath122 , and then taking the limit @xmath131 , @xmath132 , we obtain the critical value of the species - selective mit @xmath134 for the inverse mit , when the transition approaches @xmath131 , @xmath135 at @xmath136 . in a similar way",
    ", we obtain the critical value of the inverse mit @xmath137 one can see that @xmath128 is always larger than @xmath138 .",
    "this means that the inverse mit always occurs before the species - selective one .",
    "therefore , for strong inter - species interaction ( @xmath79 ) , there would be a reentrant effect of mit . with increasing the intra - species interaction @xmath13 , the mixture first stays in the insulating state ,",
    "then it is transformed into the metallic state when @xmath139 , and finally , the mixture goes back to the insulating state when @xmath140 .",
    "note that the first and second insulating states are quite different . in the first insulating state ,",
    "the inter - species double occupancy vanishes , while the intra - species one remains finite . in the second insulating state ,",
    "the single - component atoms become free , albeit being localized , and the intra - species double occupancy vanishes .",
    "experiments would observe this reentrant effect of mits by measuring the intra- and inter - species double occupancies .",
    "we have studied the mit in the three - component fkm by the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson approach at the mean - field level .",
    "although the slave boson mean field approximation is simple , the obtained results reproduce all important features of the mit , that are obtained within the more sophisticated dmft .",
    "in particular , the filling conditions and the critical value of the local interaction of the mit are analytically established . moreover , the slave boson mean - field approximation allows us to clarify the nature of different mits , which occur in the three - component fkm , in a simple physics picture .",
    "this is an advantage of the slave boson approach . in the collective mott insulator ,",
    "all band renormalization factors as well as the double occupancies vanish .",
    "the collective mit occurs only at the commensurate fillings . at the incommensurate fillings , the species - selective or the inverse mit may occur .",
    "the species - selective mit occurs only at half filling of the two - component atoms irrespective of the filling of the single - component atoms .",
    "actually , in the species - selective mit only two - component atoms are involved , while the single - component ones become free of interactions .",
    "the freedom of the single - component atoms in the species - selective mott insulator is a special feature that makes its distinction from other mott insulators .",
    "the inverse mit occurs when the total filling of the single - component atoms and of one component of the two - component atoms reaches a unit .",
    "this mit occurs only for weak intra - species local interactions .",
    "the obtained results , which are in good agreement with the dmft , suggest that the kotliar - ruckenstein slave boson at the mean - field level is already adequate to describe the mit in multicomponent fermion - fermion mixtures of ultracold atoms .",
    "in addition , the slave boson mean - field approximation also provides the criteria of the mit through the band renormalization factors and the double occupancies . since experiments of ultracold atom mixtures detect the mott insulator by counting the number of doubly occupied sites , it is a challenge to observe the mit in multicomponent fermion - fermion mixtures of ultracold atoms .",
