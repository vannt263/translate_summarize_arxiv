    "the following problem is well - known in the area of probability . a biased coin is given , but the probability of heads is unknown .",
    "we flip it @xmath0 times and get @xmath1 heads .",
    "estimate the probability of heads .",
    "this is called parameter estimation , because the probability of heads is a parameter of the coin . the most typical approach to solve this problem is the maximal likelihood method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 .",
    "then    @xmath3    since we have absolutely no information about @xmath4 , we choose @xmath5 $ ] for which this expression is maximal .",
    "this approach has several shortcomings . 1 . ) for small @xmath0 we get unrealistic estimations .",
    "for example , if @xmath6 and we get a head , the method gives the estimation @xmath7 , and if we get a tail , the method gives @xmath8 .",
    "the method grabs the highest @xmath4 , but does not take into account the error in the estimation .",

    "then , when @xmath12 , we have @xmath13 , and when @xmath14 we have @xmath15 . if we estimate the value of @xmath4 using the maximum likelihood method , we obtain @xmath14 because @xmath16 is the highest probability . however , this is just slightly larger than @xmath17 and for @xmath18 choices of @xmath4 we have @xmath13 .",
    "so we are better off choosing @xmath19 , for example , in order to avoid making a large error .",
    "another approach to estimating @xmath4 for a biased coin comes from decision theory ( [ 3 ] ) , and requires the use of a loss or utility function .",
    "our method also requires a loss function , but ours is different than the ones found in the literature .",
    "we solve the problem using game theory .",
    "there are two players : player i and player ii .",
    "player i selects a probability @xmath4 , and player ii makes a guess @xmath20 for the value of @xmath4 , knowing @xmath21 , the number of heads out of @xmath0 tosses .",
    "they agree that player ii must pay @xmath22 dollars as a penalty to player i. more generally , we will assume that @xmath4 can be a borel probability measure on @xmath23 $ ] , not just a fixed number , and so can the choices of @xmath20 .",
    "the goal of player i is to choose @xmath4 to maximize the penalty , while the goal of player ii is to minimize the penalty .",
    "the choices of these borel measures are secretly made , however , we shall see that a nash - equilibrium ( see @xcite , @xcite ) of the best strategies exists , and because of this , they can be made public .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : section 2 contains a description of the problem , section 3 contains our main result concerning the case of two tosses , and sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the proofs of our main result .",

    "let @xmath25 be the number of heads observed .",
