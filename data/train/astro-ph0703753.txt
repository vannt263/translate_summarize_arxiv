    "the o  c ( observed - calculated , see e.g. sterken 2005 ) diagram can be used to measure the secular variation of pulsation periods in time .",
    "this technique is particularly attractive for two classes of pulsators : the hot subdwarfs ( sdbs ) and the white dwarfs ( wds ) ( kepler et al . 1999 , 2005 ) , as their short pulsation periods ( few minutes ) are extremely stable in time .",
    "thus , for these objects , we can obtain very precise o ",
    "c measurements that can open the possibility of detecting secondary bodies with very low masses , down to the brown dwarf ( bd ) and even the planetary limit .",
    "note that to use more `` traditional '' methods to detect bds or planets around sdbs or wds is quite difficult .",
    "due to the high gravity , the absorption lines of these objects are very broad and therefore the radial velocity measurements can rarely reach the high accuracy required . in principle , the transit method can be used , but the probability that a transit occurs is very low because of the small radii of these stars ( @xmath610@xmath7 km for an sdb star and @xmath610@xmath8 km for a wd ) . therefore the o ",

    "the sdb pulsating star hs  2201 + 2610 ( hereafter hs  2201 ) has been observed for 7 years through a long term monitoring program ( 151 runs of time - series photometry at 17 different telescopes , see table 1 for more details ) , with the main goal of measuring the variation of the pulsation periods in time ( dp / dt ) . with a much shorter data set , silvotti & kalytis ( 2003 ) were able to derive an upper limit @xmath14p@xmath14@xmath153.8@xmath110@xmath2 relatively to the main pulsation period .",
    "the secular variation of the pulsation periods is related to the structural changes in the star due to its evolution . when a pulsation period changes in time , the typical shape of the o ",
    "c diagram is a second - order order polynomial that goes up or down depending whether the period is increasing or decreasing .",
    "this effect can be seen in fig.1 ( upper panel ) , where the o  c diagram suggests a value of p=(1.3@xmath00.1)@xmath110@xmath2 .",
    "however , a simple 2nd order polynomial is not able to give a satisfactory fit : subtracting the polynomial , we still have significant residuals with a sinusoidal shape ( lower panel of fig.1 ) that require a different interpretation .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the sinusoidal behavior is related to a wobble of the sdb barycenter due to the presence of a low - mass companion .",
    "depending on its position around the barycenter of the system , the sdb star is periodically closer or more distant from us by about 5.6 light seconds .",
    "this is why the timing of the pulsation is cyclicly advanced or delayed . from our best fit of the o ",
    "c diagram and kepler s third law ( assuming a circular orbit ) we derive : p@xmath16=1136@xmath037 days , @xmath17=@xmath41.7  au , msin@xmath3=@xmath43.5 m@xmath5 ( @xmath17 being the separation from the star ) . note that although a projected radius of @xmath185 light seconds points toward a planet ( for the sun this value is almost 3  s ) however , depending on the unknown inclination @xmath3 of the system , the mass of the companion might also be compatible with a bd ( 2.5@xmath19@xmath20@xmath3@xmath2015@xmath19 ) or even a low - mass star ( @xmath3@xmath202.5@xmath19 ) .",
    "although fig.1 suggests the presence of a low - mass companion around hs  2201 , the last two points are not consistent with the proposed solution , suggesting some prudence in our conclusions .",
    "new data are needed in order to confirm this discovery .",
    "another two runs in june and july 2006 ( see table 1 ) , not yet reduced and analyzed , and a new run in november 2006 can help . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution proposed in fig.1 is not the only one and the fit can be easily improved if we increase the number of parameters ( e.g. introducing a second planetary body and/or elliptic orbits ) .",
    "for all of these reasons the solution proposed in this paper must be considered only as very preliminary .",
    "another important point is that hs  2201 has many pulsation periods ( three with amplitudes greater than 1 mma , silvotti et al .",
    "2002 ) and it is possible , in principle , to build an independent o  c diagram for each of the frequencies . with new high quality data we aim to obtain the o ",
    "c diagram not only of @xmath211 ( amplitude of 1% ) but also of @xmath212 ( amplitude of 0.4% ) . using our present set of data , based on 1 - 2 m class telescopes , the o ",
    "c diagram of @xmath212 has very large error bars , but at least its shape is not in contradiction with that of @xmath211 .    on the other hand , to confirm the discovery of a planetary body around hs  2201 using other methods appears to be rather difficult .",
    "astrometry and interferometry are excluded due to the distance of this star ( about 1200 pc ) . as already discussed in section 1 , to measure radial velocities with a high accuracy",
    "seems difficult due to the high surface gravity ( @xmath22=5.4 , stensen et al . 2001 ) . in the ir domain ,",
    "a typical signature of a cool companion is an ir excess in the spectral energy distribution .",
    "this excess is not seen in hs  2201 by the jhk 2mass measurements , which can exclude a late - type ms companion with a mass greater than about 0.35 m@xmath23 . in order to push down this limit further",
