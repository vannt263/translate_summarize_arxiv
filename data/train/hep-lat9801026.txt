    "the work of yang and lee @xcite , later expanded by various other authors @xcite , on the behaviour of spin models in _ complex _ external fields has provided an important paradigm for the understanding of the nature of phase transitions . in brief , yang and lee observed that the partition function of a system above its critical temperature @xmath4 was non - zero throughout some neighbourhood of the real axis in the complex external field plane .",
    "as @xmath5 the endpoints of loci of zeroes moved in to pinch the real axis , signalling the transition .",
    "when such endpoints occur at non - physical ( i.e. complex ) external field values they can be considered as ordinary critical points with an associated edge critical exponent .",
    "the picture was later extended by fisher to temperature driven transitions by considering the analyticity properties of the free energy in the complex temperature plane @xcite .",
    "a few equations to flesh this out would perhaps not go amiss . on a finite graph @xmath6 with @xmath7 vertices",
    "the free energy of an ising - like spin model can be written as @xmath8 where the fugacity @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the ( possibly complex ) external field .",
    "the @xmath11 are the yang - lee zeroes , which in the thermodynamic limit form dense sets on curves in the complex @xmath12 plane . in the infinite volume limit @xmath13 the free energy per spin",
    "is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density of the zeroes , which can be shown to appear on the unit circle in the complex @xmath12 plane in the ising case ( the yang - lee circle theorem ) . for @xmath16 or ,",
    "if one prefers @xmath17 , there is a gap with @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and at these edge singularities we have @xmath20 which defines the yang - lee edge exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this also implies @xmath21 .",
    "various finite size scaling relations relate the yang - lee exponent to the other critical exponents @xcite and can be used in numerical determinations of critical behaviour @xcite .    the yang - lee circle theorem of @xcite guarantees that the roots of the partition function of the ising model on a fixed graph @xmath6 lie on the unit circle , but it does not guarantee that this should be the case when the partition function is defined by a sum over some class of random graphs for each @xmath7 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the partition function on a given graph in the class .",
    "this is the case for models of 2d quantum gravity , where the sum is over planar @xmath24 random graphs , and in this paper where we will will consider a sum over thin , _",
    "non_-planar random graphs .",
    "the work of staudacher @xcite showed that , nonetheless , the zeroes did appear on the unit circle for planar graphs , which has recently been confirmed by numerical finite - size scaling investigations using both series expansions and monte - carlo simulations by ambjrn et.al . @xcite .    in this paper we will consider a partition function of the form equ.([part ] ) for thin random graphs .",
    "spin models on such thin random graphs are of interest because they give a way of investigating mean - field effects thanks to their tree - like local structure @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the thin random graphs in such investigations over genuine tree - like structures such as the bethe lattice @xcite is that boundary effects are absent .",
    "the complications of being forced to consider only sites deep within the lattice which occur on the bethe lattice are thus absent .",
    "the motivation for the current work is the calculation of the exponent @xmath1 for thin random graphs and the testing of its universality .",
    "the calculation of the edge exponent in the ising model context also allows us to check its temperature independence .",
    "a mean - field value for @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath25 ) would demonstrate that the mean - field nature of critical behaviour on such random graphs models extended to complex couplings .",
    "we shall use the approach of @xcite to solve both the hard dimer model and the ising model itself in a complex external field .",
    "the requisite ensemble of thin random graphs is generated by considering the scalar limit of a matrix model . in all cases",
    "the partition function of equ.([part ] ) is given by an integral of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inverse of the quadratic part of the action @xmath28 , the @xmath29 are the fields which give the appropriate decoration of the graph , and @xmath30 is the vertex coupling .",
    "the factor @xmath31 counts the number of undecorated graphs in the class of interest , and generically grows factorially with @xmath7 .",
    "a given graph appears as a particular `` feynman diagram '' in the expansion of equ.([part2 ] ) and the integration over @xmath30 picks out graphs with @xmath32 vertices .",
    "the coupling @xmath30 is irrelevant for the discussion of critical behaviour as it may be scaled out of the action and hence any saddle point equations . in the large @xmath7 limit",
    "the integral in equ.([part2 ] ) may be evaluated by saddle point methods .",
    "phase transitions appear when an exchange of dominant saddle points occurs , either continuously giving a second order transition , or discontinuously giving a first order transition .",
    "the saddle point integrals which appear are the @xmath0 equivalent of those in instanton and large orders calculations in field theory @xcite .",
    "as we are taking an @xmath13 limit at the start of our calculations , we are unable to explicitly calculate zeroes on finite lattices and verify the yang - lee circle theorem .",
    "however , we shall see that the end - points of the loci of zeroes do lie on the unit circle in the complex fugacity plane .",
    "one important property of the yang - lee edge exponent @xmath1 in all the models examined so far is that it is independent of @xmath33 ( for @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible in general to get a quick and dirty determination of its value for ising models by taking the so - called hard dimer limit , which corresponds to @xmath34 , and has certain simplifying features compared with the general case .",
    "we will calculate the edge exponent for the hard dimer model on @xmath2 and @xmath3 random graphs in the next section .",
    "a calculation of the exponent for the ising model proper in the section which follows this will investigate whether the temperature independence still holds .",
    "the partition function of the hard dimer model on a given graph is defined @xcite by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a dimer activity and @xmath37 is the number of ways of placing @xmath38 dimers on the @xmath39 edges of the graph @xmath6 such that at most one dimer is attached to each vertex ( hence `` hard '' ) .",
    "precisely this expression appears in taking the limit @xmath34 in the high temperature series for the ising model partition function .",
    "the role of @xmath10 in the definition of the edge singularity exponent is taken by @xmath36 and we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the appropriate @xmath13 limit of @xmath42 . for both planar and thin random graphs we are interested in a sum @xmath43 and in @xcite the appropriate two matrix integral to generate the dimer partition function on @xmath2 and @xmath3 planar graphs was written down . for thin @xmath2 graphs the required action for insertion into equ.([part ] ) is @xmath44 where the @xmath45 propagators represent the unoccupied links and the @xmath46 propagators the dimers .",
    "the two vertices are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath47 weight appears because each end of the dimer contributes a @xmath48 vertex .",
    "we have scaled out @xmath30 for clarity .",
    "similarly for @xmath3 graphs we find @xmath49 the saddle point equations @xmath50 for both equs.([phi3],[phi4 ] ) can be easily solved .",
    "concentrating on the @xmath2 case for simplicity , we find @xmath51 so the resulting saddle point action is @xmath52 we can see that the saddle point solution presents a singularity at a negative value , @xmath53 .",
    "the free energy is given by the logarithm of the action to leading order in @xmath54 , so we would expect an inverse square root divergence at @xmath55 when we differentiate @xmath56 twice if @xmath1 were equal to its mean - field value of @xmath25 .",
    "this is , indeed , the case .",
    "writing @xmath57 and expanding we find @xmath58 as @xmath46 appears at most quadratically in equ.([phi3 ] ) an alternative approach is to integrate it out to get the action @xmath59 which has the saddle point solution @xmath60 and displays an identical divergence @xmath61 at @xmath53 to equ.([div ] ) .",
    "the geometrical picture of such an integration on the @xmath46 variables is that all the dimers are collapsed to give new @xmath62 vertices and assigned the appropriate weight .",
    "whichever way the calculation is carried out , the appearance of the square root divergence confirms that @xmath63 , which is the mean - field value of the edge exponent .    the universality of the result with respect to the coordination number of the vertices can be confirmed by solving the saddle point equations for equ.([phi4 ] ) , which we do not reproduce here , or by integrating out @xmath46 to give @xmath64 which has the saddle point solution @xmath65 leading to the saddle point action @xmath66 when expanded around the singularity at @xmath67 it also gives a square root divergence @xmath68 the exponent @xmath1 is thus seen to be independent of the coordination number of the random graphs ( three and four for @xmath2 and @xmath3 graphs , respectively ) on which the dimers are placed .",
    "the hard dimer calculation represents a determination of the edge exponent at one point on the ( @xmath69 ) plane .",
    "we now turn to the solution of the ising model in an external field in order to confirm this value for generic points on the singular @xmath70 line .",
    "the action for the ising model on @xmath2 graphs in an external field may be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the transition point in the model is determined by first solving the saddle point equations @xmath73 and then using these solutions to determine at which point the hessian of the second partial derivatives is zero @xcite",
    ". this will pick up any continuous transitions that are present .",
    "the net result of these ( lengthy ) calculations is the following formula for @xmath74 , the curve in the @xmath75 plane along which the hessian is zero @xmath76    it is perhaps worthwhile to consider the solution in zero external field at this point for orientational purposes . in that case",
    "we have at high temperatures @xmath77 which bifurcates in a mean - field magnetisation transition at @xmath78 to the low temperature solutions @xmath79 valid for @xmath80 .",
    "the distinguished role of the zero - field critical point @xmath78 is clear in equ.([crit ] ) .",
    "@xmath81 develops an imaginary part for @xmath82 ( in the high temperature phase ) and if we plot its modulus as in fig.2 we can see clearly that @xmath83 for @xmath82 .",
    "this shows that the endpoints , at least , of the line of zeroes lie on the unit circle . without explicit finite size calculations , or simulations of the model in a complex field in the style of @xcite we can not say that the zeroes lie on the unit circle , but it is reasonable to conjecture that they do , just as for planar graphs .",
    "extracting the critical exponent from the magnetisation turns out to be easiest proposition for the ising model in a field .",
    "the expression for the magnetisation in this case is @xmath84 and it is directly related to the density of zeroes on the unit circle by @xmath85 we proceed by substituting the saddle point solutions for @xmath86 in field that led to equ.([crit ] ) into equ.([mm ] ) before taking the limit in equ.([magtheta ] ) above .",
    "the positions of the critical endpoints on the unit circle can be extracted by examining the discontinuities in the resulting expression , and are given by @xmath87 which is also consistent with equ.([crit ] ) for @xmath88 .",
    "the endpoints can be seen to move in to pinch the real axis , @xmath89 as @xmath90 , confirming the yang - lee picture of the transition .",
    "an expansion of the density of zeroes around @xmath91 for generic @xmath92 still rapidly degenerates into considerable , and not very illuminating , algebraic complexity .",
    "however , fixing @xmath92 and examining various points along the critical line in equ.([crit ] ) reduces the level of difficulty to that of the hard dimer calculations in the previous section . for any given value of @xmath82",
    ", we do indeed find that @xmath93 by using equ.([magtheta ] ) .",
    "in fig.3 the density of zeroes is plotted against @xmath94 for @xmath95 and the square root nature of the singularity is evident , as can be confirmed by fitting to the curve for this and other values of @xmath92 .",
    "both the hard dimer calculations and those for the full ising model in an external field produce the mean - field value for the edge exponent . given the body of previous results in @xcite showing mean - field behaviour in various models on random graphs ( and the observation in the first of @xcite that the saddle point equations in the mean - field models were identical in content to the recursion relations use to solve the models on trees ) this is no great surprise , though it does provide the first confirmation that the mean - field critical behaviour on random graphs extends to critical phenomena at complex couplings .",
    "the inherent simplicity of the saddle point equations for random graphs made obtaining expressions for the singular behaviour and the position of the critical endpoints a simple task in the hard dimer model and also allowed for a demonstration of universality by examining both @xmath2 and @xmath3 graphs .",
    "the solution of the ising model in field was rather more forbidding , and we have not presented many of the resulting elephantine equations here , but it was still possible to give a simple demonstration by semi - numerical means that @xmath63 along the critical curve .",
    "we have also seen that for the ising model the singular endpoints of the line of zeroes stay on the unit circle in the complex fugacity plane , which provides support for the yang - lee circle theorem with partition functions of the form in equ.([part ] ) that involve sums over thin random graphs .",
    "this naturally leads to the conjecture that all the yang - lee zeroes lie on the unit circle for the ising model on thin random graphs , just as on planar graphs , which could be confirmed by a finite size scaling analysis for the thin random graph model in the manner of that carried out in @xcite for planar graphs .",
    "another possible extension of the present work would be to consider the fisher zeroes in the model by examining the behaviour in the complex temperature plane .    indeed , a more comprehensive investigation of complex phases for various spin and vertex models on both planar and non - planar random graphs , in the manner of that carried out by matveev and shrock @xcite for regular lattices , might prove illuminating .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to see if the complex temperature and complex field singularities with atypical ( and lattice dependent ) exponents found in @xcite had their counterparts in random graph models .",
