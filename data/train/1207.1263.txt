    "nambu  goldstone bosons ( often referred to as goldstone bosons ) appear necessarily in quantum field theories with spontaneously broken global continuous symmetries  @xcite .",
    "the bosons remain massless provided the symmetries are exact , acquiring masses only in the case of approximate symmetries . in the latter case they are called pseudo nambu  goldstone bosons ( pngb ) .    in nature , pngb manifest themselves as the lightest pseudoscalar mesons from the su(3 ) flavor octet    the pions  @xcite .",
    "this happens due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry braking in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the kaons may also be identified as pngb  @xcite .",
    "the pngb modes appearing in dense matter formed inside astrophysical objects , such as core collapse supernovae and compact stars , could make a dramatic impact on their thermal evolution . in 1965",

    "the modified urca and bremsstrahlung neutrino processes  @xcite .",
    "since then , the role of pngb modes for compact star cooling attracts much attention  @xcite .",
    "the extreme conditions can also be fabricated in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in this letter production of neutrinos in interactions of photons with pngb",
    "is studied within the standard model .",
    "specifically , the neutrino emissivities through the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are calculated .",
    "the standard model accommodates the following reaction :    @xmath3    represented by the feynman diagram in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "( @xmath4 ) .",
    "processes related to  ( [ fi0 ] ) by crossing have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding matrix element is  @xcite    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the elementary electric charge , @xmath7 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath8 denotes the photon polarization vector , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the four - momenta of @xmath13 , the final neutrinos and @xmath14 , respectively , @xmath15 is the pion vector form factor .    squaring ( [ ampl_2 ] ) yields    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the fine structure constant , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mandelstam variables .",
    "after the standard algebra one obtains the cross section of  ( [ fi0 ] ) for each neutrino flavor :    @xmath21    details of similar calculations can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that though the formfactor depends , in general , on the momentum transfer @xmath22 , in the present analysis it is taken to be constant since we deal with reactions proceeding at conditions comparable to the case of the decay @xmath23 ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) . the change of @xmath44 in the interval @xmath45 mev constitutes only few percent , so that one can take the integral with good accuracy mass independent .",
    "this approximation becomes even much better for small masses and higher temperatures .",
    "it appears that the proposed process @xmath46 mimics the reactions @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xcite and should also be considered in studies as  @xcite . moreover , there are conditions under which the process @xmath46 dominates over @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the matter is that the rates of the latter two reactions are proportional to the width of the decay @xmath49",
    "@xcite whose experimental value is not yet convincingly determined and varies in the very wide range  from @xmath50@xmath51",
    "ev  @xcite to @xmath50@xmath52 ev  @xcite .",
    "this fact is inevitably reflected in the results of calculations of the related neutrino emissivities strongly depending on @xmath53 adopted . in addition , the neutrino emission through @xmath48 varies in the pion pole as @xmath54 and is therefore sensitive to the change of the @xmath35 decay width .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath55 in the medium may be orders of magnitude larger than in vacuum  @xcite causing thus a suppression of the corresponding neutrino emission .",
    "in contrast to this situation , the growth of @xmath55 leads to a significant enhancement of the energy loss through @xmath46 ( see section  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependences of the emissivities are depicted in fig .",
    "the calculations are performed assuming the vacuum values of @xmath56 and @xmath36 .",
    "one can see that @xmath57 largely dominates over the neutrino emissivities through the competing process @xmath47 for @xmath58 mev and through @xmath48  @xcite for all considered temperatures provided the astrophysical limit on @xmath59  @xcite is used . even if one assumes that @xmath59 is equal to its upper experimental limit  @xcite , the contribution of @xmath46 to the emissivity remains to be dominant over that of the pion pole mechanism @xmath48 for temperatures @xmath60 mev .",
    "regardless of this , the analyzed processes have small impact compared to the urca and modified urca processes over most of the temperature range considered .",
    "photons are also able to produce single neutrinos on charged pngb :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing to ( [ charged ] ) are shown in fig .",

    "maskawa matrix element , @xmath67 is the pion decay constant , @xmath68 is the pion axial - vector form factor .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to a consideration of the single electron neutrino photoproduction : @xmath69 . in this case ,",
    "unless the in - medium mass of the pion becomes very small ,  @xmath70 , one can safely neglect the contributions of the diagrams  ( a ) and  ( b ) for they are helicity suppressed being proportional to @xmath71 exactly as in the decay  @xmath72  ( see eq .",
    "( [ matrix_ab ] ) )",
    ".    then , keeping only the contribution of the diagram  ( c ) , which is free of the helicity suppression , and squaring  ( [ matrix_sum ] ) yields    @xmath73    so that the corresponding cross section reads    @xmath74    making the same assumptions as in section  [ sec0 ] one arrives at the following relation connecting @xmath57 with the neutrino emissivity through the process  @xmath75 ( denoted by @xmath76 ) :    @xmath77    in  ( [ ratio ] ) the factor 1/2 takes into account the fact that the neutrino in the reaction @xmath75 carries away only a half of the total energy .",
    "numerically , at the vacuum values @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80  @xcite ,  ( [ ratio ] ) gives @xmath81 .",
    "since the absolute square of the matrix element for the process  ( [ charged ] ) including the contributions of the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) may be useful for similar calculations , its full form is given in the appendix .",
    "in the previous sections it was assumed that the width of the pion as well as its mass do not depend on temperature .",
    "meanwhile , these particle properties are expected to be modified under extreme conditions which can be encountered inside some stars or fabricated in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the neutrino photoproduction on pngb in a hot and dense medium .",
    "there is a set of models based on the su(2 ) nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite predicting an enhancement of the neutral pion decay width at the so - called mott temperature at which the pion dissociates into quark ",
    "antiquark pairs  @xcite . since the neutrino emissivity found in this letter is proportional to @xmath36 ( see ( [ emmis2 ] ) ) , one may expect that it will also grow at some critical temperature .",
    "let us implement the thermal effects into our calculations through the pion decay constant and the pion mass following the model given in  @xcite . within a renormalized version of the njl model  @xcite , in the chiral limit",
    ", one arrives at the well known result  @xcite    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the number of colors .",
    "hereafter @xmath83 is taken to be equal to  3 .    a substitution of  ( [ g_fp ] ) into  ( [ emmis2 ] ) yields    @xmath84    it is notable that the emissivity turns out to be independent on @xmath85 in the considered energy range .",
    "this property follows from the mass dependence of the integral ( [ intergral ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and is very convenient since in such a case one should not study the influence of the extreme conditions on the pion mass and take it into account .",
    "the thermal effects are completely determined by the pion decay constant .",
    "that is why in  ( [ emmis22 ] ) we write @xmath86 instead of @xmath87 .",
    "now it is obvious from  ( [ emmis22 ] ) that models in which the pion decay constant drops down with increasing temperature predict an enhancement of the neutrino emissivity through the reaction @xmath88 .",
    "for example , the model described in  @xcite accommodates just the case .",
    "the thermal behavior of @xmath67 taken from  @xcite is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . using this parameterization of @xmath67 in  ( [ emmis22 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the temperature dependence of the emissivity of neutrinos of flavor @xmath26 in a hot and dense medium shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . as expected , a fast growth of the emissivity by orders of magnitude near the critical temperature is clearly observed .",
    "the extreme conditions can be created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "dileptons can serve as crucial probes in the study of matter under such conditions  @xcite .",
    "the basic quantity for connecting our calculations to measurements in heavy - ion collisions is the number of neutrino pairs emitted per unit space - time  @xcite :    @xmath89}\\frac{d^3{\\bf k_{\\pi}}}{\\left[\\exp{(\\omega_{\\pi}/t)-1}\\right]}\\sigma_{\\pi}v_r , \\label{emmis_nu}\\ ] ]    evaluations of the integrals are quite similar to the case of  ( [ emmis ] ) .",
    "one can find that    @xmath90    the volume element is @xmath91 , where @xmath22 is the proper time and @xmath92 is the rapidity of the `` fireball '' emitting the neutrinos . in central collisions of",
    "equal mass ions @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the ion radius .",
    "then    @xmath95    here @xmath96 is the time interval during which the state of matter exists .",
    "one needs to know how the matter evolves in time ( in other words , one needs to know the time dependence of temperature @xmath97 ) .",
    "let us use the model described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to change the variable of integration in  ( [ emmis_nu3 ] ) from @xmath22 to @xmath25 :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the initial temperature of the thermalized quark - gluon matter , @xmath100 is the temperature of the transition from the quark - gluon phase to pure hadron phase ( the critical temperature ) , @xmath101 is the temperature at which the hadron phase breaks up into free hadrons . for ultrarelativistic pb - pb collisions at the lhc energies , typically @xmath102 mev , @xmath103  fm , @xmath104  fm , @xmath105  mev .",
    "the evolution of @xmath67 adopted in this letter assumes @xmath106 mev .",
    "apart from the pure hadronic phase , there may appear the mixed phase for which the neutrino emission rate is given by  @xcite    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the thermalization time ( @xmath109 fm ) .",
    "our calculations of the neutrino emission rates using  ( [ emmis_nu4 ] ) and  ( [ emmis_nu5 ] ) for ultrarelativistic pb - pb collisions at @xmath110 are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the in - medium modification of the pion decay constant leads to an orders of magnitude enhancement of the neutrino emission as temperature approaches its critical value",
    ". the neutrinos can be directly detected .",
    "the main contribution to the background in the region @xmath110 arises from the leptonic decays of @xmath111 and @xmath112 mesons at rest which produce neutrinos with fixed energies : @xmath113 mev for @xmath114 ; @xmath115 mev for @xmath116 ; @xmath117 mev for @xmath118 and @xmath119 mev for @xmath120 .",
    "these background events can be well separated out from the continuous spectrum of the neutrinos coming from the reaction @xmath121 and the latter may provide thus a distinctive signature of appearance of hot and dense matter . apart from a direct observation of the neutrinos , the considered process can in principle",
    "manifest itself in the form of missing energy in experiments studying the extensive air showers initiated by ultra - high energy cosmic ray nuclei in earth s atmosphere provided the fall of @xmath122 with increasing temperature is rather dramatic than the one predicted by the model adopted in this letter .",
    "simultaneously this will generate an additional flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "photoproduction of neutrino  antineutrino pairs and single neutrinos in the reactions @xmath88 , @xmath123 is studied within the standard model .",
    "the corresponding cross sections are found analytically .",
    "the energy loss due to neutrino emission in a thermal plasma of photons and pions is calculated .",
    "it is shown that the obtained neutrino emissivities may be significantly enhanced in hot and dense matter due to in - medium modification of the pion decay constant .",
    "this process has fascinating phenomenological consequences . in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , for example",
    ", this will yield a background of directly produced neutrinos with an evaporation - like spectrum in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "it is noticeable that its emergence in interactions of the primary ultra - high energy cosmic ray nuclei with the atomic nuclei of earth s atmosphere or moon rock will generate an additional flux of neutrinos .",
    "this phenomenon may manifest itself in the form of missing energy in the cosmic ray energy spectrum because the experimentally unregistered neutrinos will carry away a fraction of the total collision energy . in this connection , it is interesting to speculate on the origin of the knee in the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism might also play an important role in neutrino production in the early universe as well as in thermal evolution of astrophysical objects containing pseudoscalar excitations such as supernovae and compact stars .",
    "the analysis of this letter is closely related to the problem of pion stability in a hot medium .",
    "the reaction @xmath88 mimics the decay @xmath49 but in difference from the latter can proceed even in the pion rest frame at @xmath124 and with considerable probability . in other words ,",
    "the corresponding cross section does not vanish in the limit of massless neutrinos and observation of neutrino  antineutrino pairs does not therefore require the assumption of lorentz invariance violation .",
