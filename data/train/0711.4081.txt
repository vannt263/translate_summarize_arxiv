    "the significance of this notion follows from the fact that a cell - like map defined on a strongly hereditarily aspherical compactum does not raise dimension .",
    "theorem [ twa ] shows that @xmath0-systolic groups are quite different from many classical hyperbolic groups .",
    "it gives also new examples of topological spaces that can occur as boundaries of hyperbolic groups .",

    "in particular the inverse limit of this standard systolic inverse system in a @xmath0-systolic case is not the gromov boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "our construction is not valid in general systolic case , although some results are probably true for hyperbolic systolic ( not necessarily @xmath0-systolic ) groups .    in section [ split ]",
