    "<S> in quasi - two dimensional ce(ir , rh)in@xmath0 system , it has been suggested that the phase diagram contains two distinct domes with different heavy fermion superconducting states . </S>",
    "<S> we here report the systematic pressure dependence of the electron transport properties in the normal state of and , which locates in first and second superconducting dome , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observed non - fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures in both compounds , including non - quadratic @xmath1dependence of the resistivity , large enhancement of the hall coefficient , and the violation of the kohler s rule in the magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the cotangent of hall angle @xmath2 varies as @xmath3 , and the magnetoresistance is quite well scaled by the hall angle as @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed transport anomalies are common features of ( @xmath5=co , rh , and ir ) and high-@xmath6 cuprates , suggesting that the anomalous transport properties observed in are mainly governed by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , not by the ce - valence fluctuations which has been proposed to be the possible origin for the second superconducting dome . </S>"
