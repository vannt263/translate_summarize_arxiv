    "the earliest and most popular mechanism proposed for the ejection of hvss is the tidal disruption of stellar binaries by the smbh in the galactic center . in this scenario , originally proposed by @xcite and later studied by @xcite , stellar binaries on low angular momentum orbits come close enough to the smbh to be tidally disrupted in a three - body interaction . as a result ,",
    "one star acquires a large velocity , possibly becoming an hvs , while the companion remains bound to the smbh in a very eccentric orbit .",
    "such bound stars may represent the progenitors of the s - stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models show that the s - stars and the hvss can be produced from the same parent population @xcite .",
    "because of the large abundance of binaries in dense stellar environments , this process is considered a natural occurrence in galactic nuclei hosting supermassive black holes .",
    "the discovery of the first hvs star @xcite helped to validate the scenario .",

    "encounters with single stars also result in the acceleration of stars to hypervelocities , with a somewhat higher rate .",
    "@xcite predict an ejection rate of the order of @xmath12  yr@xmath2 for a single smbh and @xmath13  yr@xmath2 for a black hole binary , in agreement with available observations . however , production rates depend on several assumptions about the binary fraction in the galactic center , the state of the loss cone and the number of massive perturbers , such as giant molecular clouds or star clusters @xcite , and are uncertain within two or three orders of magnitude",
    ". possible difficulties of the tidal disruption model include the observed anisotropic distribution of hvss in the halo and the existence of hvss with measured proper motion not originating from the galactic center .",
    "high velocity stars , generally called runaways , are produced in the galactic disk by the disruption of massive binaries due to either supernova explosions or dynamical encounters . in the binary supernova mechanism ,",

    "stars are ejected as a result of close encounters between stars and binaries in dense stellar regions @xcite , and ejection velocities can be somewhat higher , being limited by the escape velocity of the most massive star .",
    "in addition , if runaways are ejected in the direction of galactic rotation , their velocity is incremented by the orbital speed at their location . in both scenarios ,",
    "runaways tend to be concentrated close to the disk plane , with typical vertical height dependent on mass @xcite .",

    "the anisotropy is weaker in the h0.5 model than in h1 because hardened binaries have larger internal orbital velocities , weakening the effect of correlated external motions ( i.e. the disc ) . nevertheless , anisotropy is still present in h0.5 .",
    "the anisotropy would be amplified if the internal orbits aligned with the disc due to the same torques that cause binary hardening .",
    "@xcite recently put constraints on the difference between the stellar age and the travel time from the galactic centre for five hvss ( the `` arrival time '' ) . in our model ,",
    "arrival time is approximately equal to the main sequence lifetime of the primary star .",
    "we plot the fraction of hvss as a function of the lifetime of the primary star in figure [ fig : lifetimes ] .",
    "the main sequence lifetime is given by @xmath111  yr and is a very steep function of mass .",
    "stars with @xmath112 survive for @xmath113  myr and will have been the companions of hvss with the longest arrival times .",
    "we find @xmath114 of hvss have companions with main sequence lifetimes @xmath115  myr , within @xmath99 of the arrival time results of @xcite .",
    "it it also worth noting that massive stars tend to have companions of similar masses , such that the companions of the most massive stars are more likely to have undergone sne explosions themselves , reducing the fraction of observable hvss with short arrival times .",
    "our results suggest that supernova - induced disruption of binaries in the galactic centre can eject stars with rates high enough to explain the majority of the observed hvss , provided that binaries are hardened compared to their counterparts in the field .",
    "we now discuss the processes that potentially lead to binary hardening , the influence of type ia supernovae on our results and the fate of undisrupted binaries .",
    "@xcite present an analysis of binary evolution and migration through gaseous discs .",
    "one of the findings is that the disc exerts a torque on the migrating binaries , which hardens them .",
    "typical hardening timescales are a few tens of external orbital times . in our case ,",
    "the external orbital timescale is @xmath116  yr and binaries are expected to harden on a timescale @xmath117  yr , much shorter than the lifetime of even the most massive stars .",
    "this validates our assumption of binary orbits remaining circular after hardening .",
    "since the hardening torque acts perpendicular to the disc plane , it also works to align the binary internal orbit with its external orbit within the disc .",
    "the effect is unlikely to be strong , as the torque direction is essentially random on length scales much smaller than the disc scale height , @xmath118  au for @xmath119 , but may lead to a weak correlation between internal and external orbital velocity planes .",
    "our calculations show that even a perfect correlation does not increase the stellar ejection rates significantly , however the spatial anisotropy of ejected star directions does become more pronounced .    another potential binary hardening mechanism is the common envelope phase at the end of the primary s life .",
    "this phase of binary star evolution may occur when the binary separation is of the same order as the primary star s radius so that the secondary star is engulfed by the envelope of the primary .",
    "the binary orbit is then hardened as ( internal ) orbital energy is used in unbinding the primary s envelope .",
    "the efficiency with which orbital energy is extracted by this process is very uncertain and we do not include its effects in our model . however , we note that common envelope evolution would be more frequent in a binary population with orbits hardened via migration through a disc and may play an important role in hvs production .      in our calculations ,",
    "we have considered only core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "white dwarfs in binary systems can explode as type ia supernovae ; since there is no remnant in that case , the binary disappears and the secondary star can also be ejected from the gc .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the rate of these supernovae , because it depends on many parameters of the system , so we can not constrain the rate of ejection of low - mass stars .",
    "their dynamics , however , are very similar to those presented in this paper .",
    "although the binary components have lower masses , the orbital separations can also be lower due to one binary component being compact , therefore the internal orbital velocities should be comparable .",
    "furthermore , since the secondary star does not need to escape the gravity of the supernova remnant , it loses less orbital energy while leaving the system .",
    "@xcite recently interpreted the hvs us708 as a possible former companion of a type ia sn progenitor .",
    "undisrupted binaries may remain visible as pulsars or x - ray binaries until the secondary star dies . using an approximate @xmath120 non - disruption probability ( see table [ table : results ] ) , we estimate a xrb creation rate @xmath121  yr .",
    "typical xrb lifetimes @xmath122  yr @xcite lead us to predict a population of @xmath123 galactic centre xrbs at any time .",
    "this number may be significantly reduced as undisrupted binaries are likely to have eccentric orbits and possibly be prone to tidal disruption .",
    "the fate of xrbs and the remnants in general is complicated by stellar dynamics within the gc , binary evolution and accretion physics and we intend to examine these issues in future work .",
    "we have used a monte carlo model to examine the effects of core - collapse sn explosions in binary stars in orbit around sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the post - sn orbits of the binary members and find that most binaries get disrupted , with some secondary stars escaping the gravity of sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "the binary disruption rate is @xmath124  yr@xmath2 , comparable to tidal disruption models .",
    "stellar ejection rates depend on the degree of binary hardening , which may occur during migration in the gaseous disc from which the binary stars formed .",
    "three cases - no hardening , moderate hardening ( binary separation reduced by a factor 2 ) and strong hardening ( reduction by 10 ) give ejection rates of @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127  yr , respectively . of these stars ,",
    "a fraction would have terminal velocities large enough to be classed as hvss observationally .",
    "for the three models , we estimate hvs populations of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 stars respectively , although these numbers are certainly optimistic .",
    "our models also preserve the spatial anisotropy of the original stellar population .",
    "however , stronger binary hardening increases the hvs production rate at the expense of dampening the spatial anisotropy .",
    "taking these factors together requires massive binaries formed in the few central parsecs of the galactic centre to have had typical separations a factor 2 less than those in the field at the point just prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "this constraint would be significantly weakened if the hardening process also caused the binary orbital planes to become somewhat correlated with the plane of the stellar disc , thus helping to preserve the spatial anisotropy of the ejected hvss .",
    "we note that the similar hvs production rates predicted by the sn - induced and tidal disruption models mean that both mechanisms likely contribute to the observed hvs population ."
