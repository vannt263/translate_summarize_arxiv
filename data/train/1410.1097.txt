    "this area corresponds to the hatched area in fig . 4 in the manuscript .",
    "as a consequence , the temporal fluctuations become uncorrelated : @xmath194 , and the roughness of the front stays constant at @xmath195 .",
    "+      as in the experiments , measuring a roughness exponent of the static front is more complex , and the same distinction between static fronts and moving fronts is necessary . as indicated on fig .",

    "[ wlsimu2 ] also shows the roughness of the front close to @xmath125 , with the value @xmath198 in agreement with the positive qkpz equation . in this regime , it is interesting to note that there is a discrepancy between the roughness measured in the moving regime ( @xmath199 ) and the one measured in the static regime , which should be compared to directed percolation @xcite . far from the two transitions when @xmath200 or @xmath201 , the two exponents are close to the `` thermal '' kpz ones .",

    "as @xmath207 is decreased further on fig . 5 in the manuscript , the roughness of the numerical fronts drops to zero at @xmath208 and then increases again as @xmath10 approaches the second transition at @xmath121 .",
    "we can note here that , deep inside the pinned phase , we expect the final front shape to depend on the initial condition .",
    "both in the experiments and the numerics , when @xmath209 , the front moves only by a small amount before getting pinned .",
    "in fact , it is worth noting that the poisson point disorder models ( first layer png as in @xcite or in a more realistic form in @xcite ) predict that the final pinned configuration has the same roughness as the initial one .",
    "hence in the numerics it is expected that the roughness drops to zero as the initial condition is flat , whereas in the experiments the initial fronts are never flat as they have already traveled through the glass beads before the flow is switched on . when we get closer to @xmath121 , the front moves a longer distance before getting pinned , and thus one recovers a more universal behavior as @xmath196 .",
    "as a control parameter , we define @xmath210 in the experiments and @xmath211 in the simulations .",
    "one can note that the value @xmath78 is quite singular , since then the noise vanishes but not the driving force . in the porous medium",

    ", we are using @xmath178 to define @xmath10 as suggested by the eikonal approximation .",
    "indeed , the parameter @xmath178 was shown to lead to the right estimation of the sawtooths angle when the fronts are static @xcite . in the simulations , porosity and tortuosity are both equal to one , and @xmath213 .    by analogy with the qkpz behavior , the constant @xmath214",
    "is determined by fitting the right velocity branch far from its pinning threshold ( see figs .",
    "[ vf_zoom ] ) .",
    "as described below , we attribute this constant value to the average roughness of the front . a closer inspection of the fig .  [ vf_zoom ]",
    "right , shows that it can be fitted with a power - law @xmath123 , with @xmath215 as shown on fig .",
    "[ vf_ffc ] .",
    "this exponent is slightly larger than the theoretically predicted value @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "one can note from fig .",
    "[ vf_zoom ] left , that this exponent is hard to determine experimentally as the number of available data points close to @xmath95 is too small .",
    "the reason for this limitation lies in experimental uncertainties , constraining the number of distinct @xmath10 to approximately 4 in this region .    in the numerics , below the first transition , @xmath216 , and beyond the second one , @xmath217 ,",
    "the velocity @xmath120 is almost linear with @xmath218 and @xmath219 , respectively .",
    "both branches have different slopes and differ from the prediction of the kpz equation ( @xmath220 at large @xmath22 ) .",
    "similarly , in the experiments , we note that both for negative @xmath221 and for positive @xmath222 , the linear branches have a different slope than one : @xmath223 and @xmath224 respectively .",
    "in addition , for the supportive flow regime in the experiments , this slope becomes @xmath225 .",
    "we attribute this behavior to a nonlinear interaction between the chemical reaction and the flow field , which enhances mixing and front velocity as studied in @xcite . indeed , since flow heterogeneities necessarily enhance the mixing and thus the reaction rate , one can expect at first order in @xmath226 to have an effective chemical velocity @xmath227 leading to an average front velocity @xmath228 for adverse flow ( @xmath229 ) , and @xmath230 for supportive flow ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "for a thin front , the local front velocity follows the eikonal equation : @xmath232 where @xmath131 is the normal of the front , @xmath132 the curvature and @xmath133 the local flow velocity .",
    "indeed , this equation is similar to the `` flux - line model '' of kardar @xcite where the chemical velocity plays the role of the lorentz force and the disordered flow of the random force . after projection",

    "<S> the eikonal approximation yields @xmath134 assuming small gradients , and normalizing by @xmath135 , leads to eq .   where @xmath136 and with the parameters @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , whose small renormalization due to the neglected terms can be estimated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference @xmath140 is related to the space average of the kpz term @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath142 is independent of the front propagation direction , and fixed by the initial condition of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> negative qkpz describes then the backward moving fronts , i.e. @xmath143 , since performing @xmath144 is equivalent to measuring the front position along the @xmath145 axis . </S>",

    "<S> although it correctly predicts the first - order transition , small - gradient qkpz may not be quantitatively accurate . </S>",

    "<S> slowly backward propagating fronts constitute beautiful experimental evidence of a chemical interface described by negative qkpz . </S>",
