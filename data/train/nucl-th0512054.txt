    "one of the theoretical issues still under discussion is a proper consideration of ti and the respective separation of spurious cm effects.the latter contaminate the calculated observables , when the independent - particle shell model and theories which take also dynamical correlations into account ( e.g. , brueckner - hartree - fock , variational monte carlo ) are used , and inhibit the extraction of reliable information on the intrinsic properties of nuclei directly from the experimental data ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) .    in this context",
    ", we prefer to deal with the intrinsic obmd and tbmd and the associated 1 dm and 2 dm @xcite .",
    "they appear naturally when calculating the cross sections of nuclear emission in the plane - wave impulse approximation , i.e. , neglecting the final - state interaction effects and the meson - exchange current contributions to the electromagnetic interactions with nuclei .",

    "the intrinsic quantities of interest are determined as the expectation values of appropriate @xmath11particle operators , that depend on the jacobi variables , in intrinsic nuclear states ( see eq .",
    "( [ e : n21 ] ) ) . an algebraic technique @xcite is applied for their evaluation , based on the cartesian representation , in which the coordinate and momentum operators are linear combinations of the creation @xmath12 and destruction @xmath13 operators for oscillating quanta in the three different space directions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by following a normal ordering procedure , these intrinsic operators can be reduced to the form : an exponential of the set @xmath14 times other exponential of the set @xmath15 .",

    "we use the intrinsic unit - normalized wf constructed from a given nti wf @xmath23 , following ernst - shakin - thaler ( est ) ( fixed - cm approximation ) @xcite , @xmath24^{1/2 } } \\label{eq08 }    , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is an eigenvector of the cm operator @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "the bracket @xmath28 is used to represent a vector in the space of the cm coordinates only .",
    "one can show that if @xmath30 is the slater determinant @xmath31 composed of single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "orbitals @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , then the evaluation of the distribution @xmath34 } ( \\vec{p},\\vec{k})$ ] is reduced to the evaluation of the matrix element @xmath35 that depends on some new complex vectors @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the obmd is evaluated in a similar way .",
    "the slater determinant @xmath37 is deduced from the original @xmath31 via a substitution @xmath38 .",
    "further analytical evaluations are simplified with the ho orbitals .",
    "for example , in the simplest case of the @xmath39 configuration , which we encounter in the @xmath0he nucleus , one can easily see that the matrix element is equal to unity since the s.p .",
    "state @xmath40 coincides with the vacuum state of the cartesian representation , viz . , @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the results obtained in this case are independent of the projection treatment used ( see eq .",

    "is obtained by equating the charge rms radius of @xmath0he , @xmath47 in the simple ho model ( @xmath48 in the ho model with cm corrections ) , with its experimental value ( @xmath49  fm ) and by taking the proton rms radius @xmath50 equal to 0.8  fm .",
    "we find @xmath51  fm and @xmath52  fm .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq09])-([eq12 ] ) a shrinking of the distribution @xmath53 ( @xmath34}(\\vec{p},\\vec{k})$ ] ) with respect to @xmath54 ( @xmath55}(\\vec{p},\\vec{k})$ ] ) follows , i.e. , each of these distributions , after being cm - corrected , increases in its central but decreases in its peripheral region .",
    "more exactly , in the case of the tbmd this effect is related to the two - dimensional surface given by the function @xmath56}(\\vec{p},\\vec{k})$ ] of the variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 at each value of the angle @xmath59 between the vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 . as shown in @xcite , the shrinking of the obmd plays an essential role in getting a fair treatment of the data on the inclusive electron scattering in the gev region .",
    "another prominent feature of @xmath34}(\\vec{p},\\vec{k})$ ] is its asymmetry due to the @xmath62dependence .",
    "1 demonstrates these changes for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is positive ( negative ) for @xmath61 in the same ( opposite ) direction with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "the ho2 curves correspond to the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath45 replaced by @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) ) . among the evident quantitative changes we observe the shift of the peak from @xmath66 towards negative @xmath64 s , for @xmath67 , due to a specific correlation induced by the cm fixation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the dimensionless quantity @xmath68}(\\vec{p},\\vec{k})/\\eta ( \\vec{p})\\eta ( \\vec{k})\\ ] ] was introduced as a measure of different correlations . in the complete absence of correlations",

    "thus statistical correlations are not active ) , @xmath71 for all @xmath60 and @xmath61 . after fixing the cm",

    "2 @xmath73 is plotted as a function of @xmath74 for selected values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath69 is significantly reduced in forward angles .",
    "the est tbmd favors momenta of opposite directions as compared to the product of the two obmd .",
    "the same holds for the tbmd of @xmath0he if jastrow - type src are included , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the corresponding @xmath69 for the case @xmath75  fm , plotted in fig .  2 ( dotted line ) ) .",
    "it is anticipated that within the est approach additional corrections due to src will appear at high values of @xmath57 and/or @xmath58 and that they will be larger when @xmath60 and @xmath61 are antiparallel .",
    "the method presented here is sufficiently flexible to be applied to a combined consideration of the cm and src .",
    "the latter , being introduced by means of jastrow correlations , do not violate the ti .",
