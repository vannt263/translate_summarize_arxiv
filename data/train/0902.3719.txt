    "in quantum computation and quantum communication the transfer of an arbitrary quantum state from one qubit to another is a fundamental element . the most obvious method to implement quantum state transfer ( qst ) on an array of qubits",
    "is based on a sequence of swap gates for neighboring spins . in spin qubit systems",
    "the swap gate ( up to a known phase factor ) can be implemented through the evolution of the dipolar coupling between the neighboring spins for @xmath0 time by decoupling the other spins , where @xmath1 denotes the dipolar coupling strength . in experiments , however , the required decoupling operations are hard to implement if the spins can not be individually addressed by spectral selectivity , e.g. , in large - size solid - state nmr systems .",
    "this makes the direct implementation of such gates in a large spin system challenging .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "schemes based on  always on  spin systems were proposed @xcite .",
    "the state can be transferred with unit fidelity in engineered spin chains or networks with @xmath2 interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the required fine - tuned @xmath2 couplings are not found in natural spin systems @xcite . in other schemes based on spin chains with heisenberg interactions @xcite or with a double - quantum hamiltonian @xcite",
    ", the fidelity of the qst can not approach unity in scalable systems .",
    "the above limitations can be relaxed significantly by applying gate operations to receive and store the transferred state @xcite .",
    "the gates are only applied to two spins at one end of a spin chain . in this paper",
    ", we experimentally implement the qst in a liquid crystal nmr system based on this scheme .",
    "opposed to previous experimental implementations @xcite where the required @xmath2 interactions were engineered by radio - frequency pulses and scalar couplings , the dipolar couplings exist naturally in the system and are directly exploited for the qst .",
    "the dipolar couplings are much stronger ( up to 2 - 3 orders of magnitude ) than the scalar couplings and therefore can significantly speed up the implementation of the logical gates for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the transfer with high fidelity is achieved in an iterative manner .",
    "each iteration transfers a finite part of the input amplitude to the target spin at the end of the chain .",
    "the fidelity of the transfer asymptotically approaches unity by increasing the number of iterations .",
    "we also experimentally demonstrate the time - inverted version of @xcite . through this , a full _ quantum data bus _ is implemented , where arbitrary unknown quantum states can be steered to an _ any _ position of the chain .",
    "this is also useful for the selective excitation of one spin , which is addressed by the two - spin gates , rather than by its individual properties , e.g. chemical shift in nmr . as opposed to previous schemes @xcite , global control",
    "is not required .",
    "surprisingly the reversal operation can also be used to _ entangle _ any pair of spins in the chain by operations at its end only .",
    "we demonstrate the entangling operation in the qubits at the end points of the chain .",
    "the qst and its reversal operations mean that the chain is really used as a wire with an input , an output , and no gates in the middle ; the many - body hamiltonian of the chain is responsible for the transport .",
    "only two spins at the end are required to address .",
    "the fidelity of transfer converges exponentially fast to unity with respect to the number of iterations .",
    "the required number of iterations to achieve a good fidelity ( e.g. larger than @xmath3 ) scales roughly linearly with the system size @xcite .",
    "moreover this method is stable when the engineered hamiltonian in implementation deviates the required hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "hence our method scales favorably with the size of the spin chains and suitable for large - size systems , such as solid or liquid crystal nmr systems , where the differences of the chemical shifts are too small to address all the spins individually .",
    "our first goal is to transfer the state @xmath4 from spins @xmath5 to @xmath6 in a @xmath6- spin chain .",
    "the hamiltonian for spins @xmath7 to @xmath8 is represented as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the pauli matrices with @xmath5 indicating the affected spin .",
    "noting that @xmath13 preserves the total number of excited spins @xcite , we have @xmath14 @xmath15where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 matrix element of @xmath19 .",
    "the state @xmath20 denotes all spins pointing up , and @xmath21 denotes all spins up except the spin @xmath5 pointing down .",

    "this method also allows to create a selective excitation that does not require spectral selectivity , e.g. chemical shift in nmr , to address spin @xmath5 .",
