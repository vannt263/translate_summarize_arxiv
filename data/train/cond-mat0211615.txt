    "the pyrochlores with the chemical formula @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the divalent element ) exhibit a number of interesting and not completely understood phenomena,@xcite which present the main motivation for the analysis of electronic and magnetic structure of these compounds , which we undertake in this work .    @xmath11 the pyrochlores @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 have rather puzzling magnetic phase diagram as a function of averaged ionic radius of @xmath3-sites , @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.tcexp]).@xcite large @xmath12 ( @xmath13@xmath14@xmath8@xmath15 ) stabilizes the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground state .",
    "typical examples of the fm pyrochlores are nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and gd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the curie temperature ( @xmath16 ) is of the order of 80 k and slowly increases with @xmath12 .",
    "smaller @xmath12 ( @xmath17@xmath14 ) give rise to the spin - glass ( sg ) behavior .",
    "the characteristic transition temperature into the sg state is of the order of 20 k. the canonical example of the sg compounds is y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite now it is commonly accepted that the exchange coupling between nearest - neighbor ( _ nn _ ) mo spins changes the sign around @xmath14 and becomes antiferromagnetic ( afm ) in the sg region .",
    "the pyrochlores with afm interactions in the lattice present a typical example of geometrically frustrated systems with infinitely degenerate magnetic ground state.@xcite according to the recent experimental data,@xcite the sg behavior itself is caused by the combination of the geometrical frustrations and the disorder of the local lattice distortions .",
    "the latter is required in order to produce an inhomogeneity in the distribution of the _ nn _ interactions and freeze the random spin configuration .",
    "the origin of this behavior itself is very complicated , and we will not be able to address it properly in our work",
    ". however , our main concern will be in some sense more general : we will try to understand which parameter of the crystal structure controls the sign of the _ nn _ magnetic interactions , and which part of the electronic structure is responsible for the fm and afm interactions in these compounds ?",
    "contrary to the widespread point of view that the magnetic ground state is controlled by the mo - o - mo angle , we will argue that the key parameter is in fact the mo - mo distance , which is directly related with the unit cell volume and controls the strength of direct interactions between extended mo(@xmath6 ) orbitals .    according to the experimental data , all mo pyrochlores which show the sg behavior are small - gap insulators .",
    "however , an opposite statement is generally incorrect and in different compounds the ferromagnetism is known to coexist with the metallic as well as insulating behavior.@xcite we will show that this trend can be naturally understood in terms of the mo - mo distances and the strength of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath7 amongst the mo(@xmath6 ) electrons .    @xmath11 the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in the pyrochlore lattice should generally lead to a non - collinear magnetic ordering associated with the modulation of single - ion anisotropy axes.@xcite the magnitude and the main source of this non - collinearity ( whether it is primarily associated with the mo or @xmath3 sublattices , and whether it reflects the ordering of spin or orbital magnetic moments ) is largely unresolved problem . in the present work we will try to rationalize this question by focusing on the magnetic structure of the mo sublattice .",
    "we will show that as long as the system is metallic ( that by itself depends on the strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath7 ) , the non - collinearity is very small . however , the transition into the insulating state is accompanied by the abrupt change of the spin and orbital magnetic structures , which become essentially non - collinear .    @xmath11 some ferromagnetic ( or nearly ferromagnetic ) pyrochlores exhibit rather unusual anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) .",
    "a non - vanishing hall conductivity ( @xmath18 ) emerges near @xmath16 , then monotonously increases with the decrease of the temperature @xmath19 , and reaches the maximal value ( @xmath18@xmath8@xmath20 @xmath21 for nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 ) near @xmath19@xmath4@xmath22 .",
    "both magnitude and the temperature dependence of the ahe is in a drastic contrast with other oxide materials , such as colossal - magnetoresistive manganites , for example.@xcite    the theory of the ahe ( originally called as the extraordinary hall effect ) has very long and rather controversial history.@xcite many controversies were related with the lack of the general transport theory and partly  with the lack of good computer facilities in 1950s and 1960s , so that many discussions went around very simplified and not always justified approximations , such as the free - electron and weak scattering limit , the single - orbital tight - binding approach , the classical boltzmann transport equation , etc.@xcite the modern way to address the problem is to use the kubo formalism and relate @xmath18 with the real part of the antisymmetric off - diagonal element of the conductivity tensor.@xcite from this point of view there are no rigid constraints which would forbid the existence of @xmath18 , even for periodic systems , once the time - reversal symmetry is violated macroscopically.@xcite    the main question is which mechanism leads to the finite value of @xmath18 .",
    "the first one was proposed by karplus and luttinger,@xcite who stressed the importance of soi in the problem .",
    "although the concrete scenario considered by karplus and luttinger was not correct,@xcite they were certainly right by arguing that the soi is essential in order to couple the spin polarization of the conduction electrons to the lattice and produce the right - left asymmetry of the stationary bloch states , which may lead to the hall current , perpendicular to both the electric field and the magnetization .    however , an exceptionally large @xmath18 observed in the pyrochlore compounds urged several authors to search for a new and unconventional mechanism for the ahe .",
    "such mechanism was proposed to be due to the spin chirality ( basically , the solid angle subtended by three non - coplanar spins ) in essentially non - collinear magnetic structure.@xcite the chirality acts as an effective field , which in the combination with the peculiar lattice geometry is believed to yield a finite @xmath18 . although the mechanism itself is rather exotic and there is a great deal of cancellations between different elements of the non - collinear spin structure,@xcite these authors were certainly right by stressing the crucial role of the inter - band transitions in the problem of ahe .",
    "in this work we will go back to a more conventional picture and argue that the large value of @xmath18 in some mo pyrochlores can be explained by rather unique combination of three factors : ( i ) large soi associated with the mo(@xmath6 ) states in the nearly collinear fm structure ; ( ii ) strong enhancement of the soi by the on - site coulomb interactions in the @xmath5 electron systems,@xcite and ( iii ) half - metallic electronic structure of the fm pyrochlores.@xcite    regarding the coulomb interaction itself , which in our work will be treated as a parameter , we will be able to present a very consistent picture by arguing that @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9-@xmath10 ev in mo pyrochlores accounts simultaneously for ( i ) metal - insulator transition ; ( ii ) fm - sg transition ; ( iii ) required enhancement for the ahe in the fm pyrochlore compounds .",

    "the pyrochlores @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 crystallize in a face - centered cubic structure with the space group @xmath23 , in which @xmath3 and mo occupy correspondingly @xmath24 and @xmath25 positions , and form interpenetrating sublattices of the corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "there are two non - equivalent types of oxygen sites , and only one internal parameter which may control the properties of @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "that is the coordinate @xmath26 of the o @xmath27 sites .",
    "the single mo tetrahedron is shown in fig .",

    "four mo sites are located at @xmath28@xmath4@xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath4@xmath31 , @xmath32@xmath4@xmath33 , and @xmath34@xmath4@xmath35 , in units of cubic lattice parameter @xmath36 .",
    "each mo site has sixfold o @xmath27 coordination .",
    "the oxygen atoms specify the local coordinate frame around each mo site .",
    "around the site 1 , it is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38@xmath4 @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath43@xmath4@xmath44 is the standard @xmath45 rotation around the cubic @xmath46 $ ] axis .",
    "@xmath26@xmath13@xmath42 gives rise to an additional trigonal contraction of the local coordinate frame .",
    "similar matrices associated with the sites 2 , 3 , and 4 can be obtained by the @xmath47 rotations of @xmath43 around @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "structural parameters of @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 are listed in table  [ tab : structure ] .",
    "corresponding densities of states , obtained in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.doslsda ] and [ fig.dost2g ] .    in the local coordinate frame , the mo(@xmath6 ) orbitals",
    "are split into the triply - degenerate @xmath5 and doubly - degenerate @xmath48 states .",
    "the splitting is of the order of 4 ev .",
    "twelve @xmath5 bands are located near the fermi level and well separated from the rest of the spectrum , which consists of the broad o(@xmath49 ) band spreading from -8.5 to -2.5 ev and either y(@xmath6 ) or gd / nd(@xmath50 ) bands located just above the group of the @xmath5 states . the mo(@xmath48 ) states are located in the higher part of the spectrum .",
    "interestingly enough that all three compounds are ferromagnetic , even in the lsda , that is rather unusual for the @xmath6 oxides , perhaps except the well know example of srruo@xmath51.@xcite    the trigonal distortion and different hybridization with the o(@xmath49 ) states will further split the mo(@xmath5 ) states into the one - dimensional @xmath52 and two - dimensional @xmath53 representation.@xcite    the crystal structure affects the mo(@xmath5 ) bandwidth via two mechanisms ( see table  [ tab : structure ] ) .    1 .   the mo - o - mo angle , which decreases in the direction nd@xmath54gd@xmath54y .",
    "therefore , the interactions between mo(@xmath5 ) orbitals which are mediated by the o(@xmath49 ) states will also decrease .",
    "this effect is partly compensated by the decrease of the mo - o bondlength for @xmath3@xmath4 gd and y. 2 .",
    "the lattice parameter @xmath36 and the mo - mo distance , which decrease in the direction nd@xmath54gd@xmath54y by 2.6% .",
    "this will increase direct interactions between extended mo(@xmath6 ) orbitals .",
    "generally , these two effects act in the opposite directions and partly compensate each other .",
    "for example , the width of the @xmath53 band is practically the same for all three compounds ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dost2g ] ) . on the other hand , the @xmath52 orbitals , whose lobes are the most distant from all neighboring oxygen sites are mainly affected by the second mechanism , and the @xmath52 bandwidth will _ increase _ in the direction nd@xmath54gd@xmath54y . as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : exchange ] , this effect plays a crucial role in the stabilization of afm interactions in y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 , which preludes the sg behavior .",
    "thus , despite an apparent complexity of the crystal structure , the pyrochlores @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 present rather simple example of the electronic structure and in order to understand the nature of fascinating electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds , we need to concentrate on the behavior of twelve well isolated mo(@xmath5 ) bands.@xcite",
    "in this and subsequent sections we will further elaborate this picture , by cutting the mo(@xmath5 ) bands from the rest of the spectrum , including the on - site coulomb interactions amongst the mo(@xmath6 ) electrons , and solving this problem on the level of hf approximation .",
    "hence , our model hamiltonian has the following form , in the basis of non - relativistic lda eigenfunctions @xmath55 ( lda is the spin - restricted version of lsda ) : @xmath56 the spin indices are already included to @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are running from @xmath59 to @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 .",

    "all magnetic effects are caused by the on - site coulomb interactions , @xmath74 , which can be written in terms of projections onto an orthonormal set of atomic - like mo(@xmath6 ) orbitals @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the translation vectors in the face - centered cubic pyrochlore lattice , and @xmath78 specify different mo sites in the unit cell .",

    ". matrix elements of the hf potential , @xmath94 , can be expressed in the most general rotationally - invariant form as:@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96@xmath4@xmath97 are the matrix elements of the coulomb interactions .",
    "the latter are fully specified by three radial slater integrals : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , which are assumed to be _",
    "renormalized _ from the bare atomic values .",
    "equivalently , one can introduce parameters of the averaged coulomb interaction , @xmath7@xmath4@xmath98 , the intra - atomic exchange coupling , @xmath101@xmath4@xmath102@xmath103@xmath104 , and the non - sphericity of the coulomb interactions between orbitals with the same spin , @xmath105@xmath4@xmath106@xmath89@xmath107 .",

    "@xmath117 is the volume of the first brillouin zone .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ eqn : dmatrix ] ) and ( [ eqn : green ] ) are solved self - consistently .",

    "@xmath105 can be estimated from @xmath101 using the ratio @xmath120@xmath121@xmath122 , which holds for the slater integrals in the atomic limit .",

    ". the constraint - lsda calculations for mo compounds typically yield @xmath7@xmath72@xmath124 ev.@xcite this value can be further reduced by allowing for the ( proper ) @xmath48 electrons to participate in the screening of the on - site coulomb interactions between @xmath5 electrons.@xcite    for the practical calculations along this line , it is convenient to use a short atomic - like basis set . for these purposes , @xmath64 and @xmath55",
    "have been first calculated using the nearly - orthogonal version of the linearized - muffin - tin orbital method in the atomic - spheres approximation ( asa - lmto).@xcite the atomic orbitals @xmath75 have been identified with the basis orbitals of the lmto method .",
    "atomic spheres radii have been chosen so to reproduce the electronic structure obtained by more accurate flapw method,@xcite especially for @xmath5 bands located near the fermi level .",
    "we have also added a number of empty spheres at the @xmath125 and @xmath126 positions of the @xmath127 lattice .",
    "all calculations have been performed on the mesh of 12@xmath6112@xmath6112 @xmath128-points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "formally , our approach is similar to the rotationally - invariant lda@xmath103@xmath7,@xcite except that we apply it only to a limited number of bands , directly responsible for the properties of @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds .",
    "this will certainly simplify the calculations .",
    "in addition , we get rid of several artifacts of the conventional lda@xmath103@xmath7 method , such as the substraction of the double - counting terms , which is a very ambiguous procedure by itself , and in the number of cases leads to a systematic error.@xcite",
    "let us first discuss results without soi , assuming fm ordering of the mo spins . according to the lsda calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dost2g ] ) , the majority ( @xmath83 ) spin @xmath52 band is fully occupied and the fermi level crosses the doubly - degenerate @xmath53 band . therefore , it is clear that at some point the coulomb @xmath7 will split the @xmath53 band and form an insulating solution with the spontaneously broken @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "such situation occurs between @xmath7@xmath4 2.0 and 2.5 ev for all considered compounds ( fig .",
    "[ fig.gap ] , the afm alignment of the mo spins may open the band gap even for smaller @xmath7 , that well correlates with the fact that all sg compounds are insulators ) .    in the metallic regime",
    "realized for small @xmath7 , the densities of states are similar to those in lsda ( figs .",
    "[ fig.doslsda ] and [ fig.dost2g ] ) , and we will not show them here again .",
    "we only mention that the major effect of @xmath7 is the shift of the @xmath83-spin @xmath52 band to the low - energy part of the spectrum relative to the @xmath53 band .",
    "corresponding orbital ordering ( the distribution of mo(@xmath6 ) electron densities ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.ooyf05 ] .",
    "it comes exclusively from the local trigonal distortions of the oxygen octahedra and represents the alternating @xmath52 orbital densities in the background of degenerate @xmath53 orbitals .",
    "typical densities of states in the insulating phase are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dos30 ] .",
    "the @xmath52 band has characteristic for pyrochlores three - peak structure.@xcite smaller band gap in the case of y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.gap ] ) is related with broad minority ( @xmath84 ) spin @xmath52 band , whose tail spreads below the unoccupied @xmath83-spin @xmath53 band .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath53 states is very similar for all three compounds .",
    "contrary to the metallic state , the orbital ordering is determined not only by local trigonal distortions , but also the form of the superexchange ( se ) interactions between _ nn _ mo sites , and minimizes the energy of these interactions.@xcite generally , it depends on the magnetic state .",
    "two typical examples for the fm and afm ( obtained after the flip of the spin moments at the sites 2 and 3 ) phases are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.ooyf30 ] and [ fig.ooya30 ] , respectively .",
    "the building blocks of the afm phase are the fm chains of the atoms ... -1 - 4 - 1 - 4- .. and ...",
    "-2 - 3 - 2 - 3- ... , which are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "as expected for the fm spin ordering,@xcite the @xmath53 orbitals tends to order  antiferromagnetically  and form two mo sublattices .",
    "corresponding eigenfunctions of the occupied @xmath53 orbitals , obtained after the diagonalization of the density matrix _ in the local coordinate frame _ , are given by @xmath129@xmath121@xmath130@xmath103@xmath131@xmath103@xmath132 for the sites 1 and 4 , and @xmath133@xmath121@xmath130@xmath103@xmath134@xmath103@xmath135 for the sites 2 and 3 , with the coefficients @xmath136@xmath121@xmath137 , @xmath138@xmath121@xmath139 , and @xmath140@xmath121@xmath89@xmath141 .",

    "2 .   there is a significant difference between nd / gd and y based compounds : in the y case , the exchange parameters are almost rigidly shifted towards negative values , so that the _ nn _ coupling become antiferromagnetic in the insulating phase , while it remains ferromagnetic in the case of nd and gd .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained from the analysis of total energies shown in fig .",

    "@xmath11 the magnetic ground state of the @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds depends on the mo - mo distance , which controls the strength of afm se interactions between the @xmath52 orbitals .",
    "the latter competes with the fm interactions between the @xmath53 orbitals , and dominates when the mo - mo distance is small . in the frustrated pyrochlore lattice , this corresponds to the transition into the sg state , though we can not specify precisely which mechanism freeze the random configuration of the mo spins .",
    "it could be the disorder of the mo - mo bondlengths proposed in refs .   and .",
    "another possibility is the anisotropy of nearest - neighbor magnetic interactions caused by the orbital ordering.@xcite it is also important to note that the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 should be sufficiently strong in order to open the band gap and suppress the fm double exchange interactions between the @xmath53 orbitals .",
    "@xmath11 the metal - insulator transition in these systems does not necessary coincide with the fm - sg transitions .",
    "all metallic compounds are expected to be nearly collinear ferromagnets , due to the double exchange mechanism . however , the inter - atomic exchange coupling in the insulating state can be both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic , depending on the mo - mo bondlength .",
    "the finding is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data.@xcite the magnetic structure in the insulating state is expected to be strongly non - collinear , due to the competition between the isotropic exchange interactions and the single - ion anisotropies .",
    "@xmath11 the large hall conductivity can be explained by the combination of three factors in the nearly collinear fm state : large soi at the mo sites , which unquenches the orbital magnetization ; strong enhancement of this effect by the on - site coulomb interaction ; and the half - metallic electronic structure of the fm pyrochlores .",
    "we also expect large magneto - optical effect in the same compounds .",
    "a possible way to enhance these properties is to use heavy @xmath50 elements , which have large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "unfortunately , all known @xmath50 pyrochlores are non - magnetic , though some of them are presumably close to the point of magnetic instability.@xcite nevertheless , one can try to exploit an old idea known from the physics of intermetallic alloys,@xcite and replace part of the mo sites in @xmath0moo@xmath2 by the @xmath50 elements . then , the main question is whether the remaining mo sites will be magnetic in the new environment or not . if they will , they will also magnetize the @xmath50 states at the neighboring sites , and in this way enhance the non - reciprocal characteristics of the considered pyrochlore compounds . as a purely model example",
    ", we have considered the ordered gd@xmath1mowo@xmath2 alloy ( using the lattice parameters of gd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 ) . according to the lsda calculations ,",
    "the system is expected to be ferromagnetic .",
    "the values of ( spin only ) magnetic moments at the mo and w sites are 2.1 and 1.5 @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "the situation is highly unusual , because the examples when @xmath6 and @xmath50 elements form a magnetic solution are rather rare .",
    "although gd@xmath1mowo@xmath2 itself may be rather unrealistic example from the technological point of view , the idea to use mo atoms in order to magnetize the heavy @xmath50 elements in the pyrochlore lattice seems to be promising .    in conclusion , the simple hf calculations allow to rationalize many unusual properties of the pyrochlore compounds @xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "it is also important that all these properties can be explained by the universal value of @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9-@xmath10 ev , which is of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic bandwidth for the mo(@xmath5 ) electrons .",
    "this will certainly place the considered compounds to the direct proximity of the metal - insulator transition , meaning that the quantum fluctuations beyond the mean - field hf approach will play an important role too .",
    "this is certainly a very important direction for the extension of the present analysis .",
    "finally , we would like to make several comments on the comparison between our calculations and the experimental magnetization@xcite and neutron diffraction@xcite data .",
    "\\(1 ) the experimental value of the mo moment ( @xmath8@xmath247-@xmath248 @xmath161 ) seems to be smaller than @xmath8@xmath160 @xmath161 obtained in our mean - field calculations for the nearly collinear fm state , even after taking into account the orbital part ( @xmath8@xmath194 @xmath161 ) , which according to the third hund s rule is antiparallel to the spin one and partly compensate the latter .",
    "the small difference is presumably related with the quantum fluctuations at the proximity of the metal - insulator transition.@xcite    \\(2 ) the experimental data for nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and sm@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 typically indicate at the existence of two antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices .",
    "these sublattices are usually regarded as mo and @xmath3 ones . however , according to the electronic structure point of view , the _ spin _ coupling between these two sublattices should be ferromagnetic,@xcite being actually consistent with the experimental data for gd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite the controversies can be reconciled with each other if the local magnetic moment at the nd / sm sites has a large orbital counterpart , which is larger than the spin one .",
    "the afm orientation of the spin and orbital moments at the nd / sm sites is again the subject of the third hund s rule .",
    "then , the magnetization and neutron diffraction experiments presumably probe the afm coupling between _ spin _ magnetic moments at the mo sites and the _ orbital _ magnetic moments at the nd / sm sites .",
    "gd@xmath249 has no orbital moment , and therefore the experimental data for this compound indicate at the conventional fm coupling between two spin sublattices . then , the sharp decrease of the magnetization observed in nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 at low @xmath19,@xcite which is frequently tempted to connect with the anomaly of the hall conductivity is due to the orbital magnetic structure , not the spin one . the change of the _ orbital _ magnetic structure seems to be the right subject to concentrate at when trying to explain , for example , the temperature dependence of the ahe . in this respect , another interesting problem seems to be the behavior of _ spin and orbital _",

    "the @xmath52 and two @xmath53 orbitals have the following form : @xmath266@xmath4@xmath267@xmath103@xmath268@xmath103@xmath269 , @xmath270@xmath4@xmath271@xmath89@xmath269 , and @xmath272@xmath4@xmath273@xmath89@xmath274@xmath103@xmath268@xmath103@xmath275 .    by considering the _ nn _ hoppings between mo(@xmath52 ) orbitals in the pyrochlore lattice , @xmath276 , it is easy to show that the electronic structure for the @xmath52 states will consist of three bands ( in units of @xmath276 ) : @xmath277@xmath4@xmath89@xmath62@xmath278 , the so - called bonding and antibonding bands , and the doubly - degenerate non - bonding band @xmath279@xmath4@xmath62 , where @xmath280@xmath4@xmath281@xmath282@xmath283@xmath103@xmath284 .    in fact , there is a non - spherical ( proportional to the coulomb parameter @xmath105 ) interaction beween occupied @xmath53 and @xmath52 orbitals , which will deforms the density of the @xmath52 electrons .",
    "this interaction has an appreciable effect in the afm state .",
    "for example , for y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and @xmath7@xmath4@xmath124 ev , the occupied @xmath52 orbital at the site 1 has the form @xmath285@xmath4@xmath130@xmath103@xmath131@xmath103@xmath135 , where @xmath136@xmath121@xmath286@xmath121@xmath287 .",

    "generally , the parameters @xmath151 depend on the magnetic state in which they are calculated and there is no simple relation between @xmath151 and the total energy . on the other hand , the total energy difference calculated for a limited number of magnetic states does not necessary guarantee that these states are locally stable to be the local minima of the total energy .",

    "results of these calculations have very transparent expanation , because gd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 has half - metallic electronic structure and the fm coupling between mo and gd spins results in the additional energy gain for the @xmath83-spin mo(@xmath5 ) electrons ( see fig .

    "the standard se interaction is proportional to the ( minus ) second moment of the density of states , that actually explains the afm sign of the coupling.@xcite the @xmath83-spin @xmath52 bandwidths in y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 differ by factor two ( fig .

    "this shift can be different for the @xmath83- and @xmath84-spin electrons and also depend on the material , that presumably explains an additional difference between y@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 and nd@xmath1mo@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "note that at least in the mean - field approximation for the one - orbital model , the effects of the inter - site coulomb interactions , which are responsible for the charge disproportionation , can be included as a renormalization of the local ( on - site ) interaction , in the spirit of model hf calculations performed in this work : i.  v.  solovyev , phys .",
