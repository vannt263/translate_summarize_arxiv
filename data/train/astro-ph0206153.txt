    "dwarf elliptical galaxies ( des ) are the most common galaxy type by number in the local universe , dominating the galaxy luminosity function of nearby clusters . yet",
    "these galaxies remain among the most poorly studied galaxies due to their faint luminosities , @xmath5 , and characteristic low effective surface brightness @xmath6  mag  arcsec@xmath7 @xcite . unlike brighter , classical elliptical galaxies whose surface brightness profiles are well fit by the de  vaucouleurs @xmath8 law @xcite , des have brightness profiles that are characterized by sersic profiles @xcite with indices ranging between @xmath93 ( where @xmath9 corresponds to an exponential law and @xmath10 to an @xmath8 law ) making them appear more diffuse than classical ellipticals of the same total magnitude @xcite . in the virgo cluster ,",
    "the majority of des brighter than @xmath11 contain compact central nuclei ; fainter than @xmath12 most des show no sign of a nucleus @xcite .",
    "nuclei typically contain 5% to 20% of the total galaxy light and are slightly resolved at the distance of virgo by _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) imaging @xcite .",
    "in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , dwarf galaxies form out of small density fluctuations in the early universe and are predicted to be less spatially clustered than normal elliptical or spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , dwarf elliptical galaxies are preferentially found in dense cluster environments , more so than either ellipticals or spirals @xcite ; there are few , if any , examples of isolated des .",
    "thus , current models favor de formation from a progenitor galaxy population . the proposed progenitors of des are spiral or irregular galaxies which are morphologically transformed into des through the processes of galaxy harassment and interaction @xcite .",
    "detailed internal kinematics of des are a powerful observational tool with which to test these scenarios .    until recently ,",
    "radial velocity dispersion profiles were only available for the local group des and two of the brightest des in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "in addition , a handful of global velocity dispersion measurements existed for des in various environments outside the local group @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that des have lower mass - to - light ratios than local group dwarf spheroidals ( e.g. ,  draco , fornax ) and are flattened by velocity anisotropy rather than by rotation .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite recently presented kinematic profiles for a few des in the virgo and fornax clusters , respectively , with rotation velocities comparable to that expected for a rotationally - flattened spheroid .",
    "these rotating des are more luminous on average than the non - rotating des we have observed , and hint at a possible association between de luminosity and the presence of rotation .    the question of whether des have significant rotation compared to their velocity dispersion is particularly important in the context of de formation scenarios .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the process of galaxy harassment in cluster environments can morphologically transform a spiral galaxy into a de .",
    "although this process tends to increase the velocity dispersion in a system , it is less efficient at disrupting rotational motions and a significant fraction of the progenitor s rotation is preserved .",
    "thus , measuring the amount of internal angular momentum in des can constrain the progenitor galaxy type and/or the amount of disruption required .",
    "we present internal kinematics as a function of radius for a sample of six  de galaxies in the virgo cluster based on keck observations .",
    "these data are interpreted in conjunction with archival _ hst _ imaging .",
    "preliminary results from this study were presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ data_sec ] we present the keck spectroscopic and _ hst _ imaging observations of our target galaxies , along with an outline of data reduction procedures ; in  [ res_sec ] we present velocity and velocity dispersion profiles and describe the dynamical models that are applied to the data to derive mass - to - light ratios , constraints on orbital anisotropy , and limits on the central black hole mass ; the broader implications of the results are discussed in  [ disc_sec ] .",
    "the virgo cluster is the closest large reservoir of de galaxies beyond the local group and presents a significantly different environment in which to study such galaxies .",
    "the six de galaxies presented below were drawn from the bright end of the virgo de luminosity function and have been imaged with _",
    "these objects lie at a variety of distances from the center of the virgo cluster as shown in figure  [ vcc ] .",
    "the positions and photometric properties of the observed galaxies are listed in table  1 .",
    "foreground reddening values are taken from @xcite assuming a standard galactic extinction law with @xmath13 . throughout this paper a virgo cluster true distance modulus of @xmath14 is adopted , i.e. ,  a distance of 15.3  mpc , as determined by the _ hst _ key project on the extragalactic distance scale @xcite .",
    "six de galaxies were observed on 2001 march 2021 using the keck  ii 10-m telescope and the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations were made in the echellette mode with continuous wavelength coverage over the range @xmath15@xmath16 across 10  echelle orders with a spectral dispersion of 11.4 km  s@xmath17  pixel@xmath17 .",
    "the spectra were obtained through a @xmath18 slit , resulting in an instrumental resolution of 23 km  s@xmath17  ( gaussian sigma ) over the entire spectrum , or @xmath19 .",
    "the slit was positioned on the major axis of each galaxy , such that the galaxy s center was displaced @xmath20 from the center of the slit along its @xmath21 length .",
    "three consecutive exposures of 20  minutes were obtained for each galaxy except vcc  1577 , for which @xmath22  minutes were obtained .",
    "a summary of the observing parameters is given in table  2 .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of giant stars covering the range of spectral types g8iii to m0iii were taken with the same instrumental setup for use as templates in the kinematic profile fitting described in  [ vp ] .",
    "standards stars were observed both centered on and trailed across the slit width in order to recover an accurate estimate of the instrumental broadening for point and extended sources , respectively .",
    "the esi data were reduced using a combination of iraf echelle and long - slit spectral reduction tasks .",
    "first , the overscan and a dark frame , scaled by the exposure time , were subtracted from the data .",
    "the sum of a bright calibration star spectral exposure and a flat field spectral exposure were used to trace the ends of the slit as well as a fiducial spatial point ( the location of the bright star ) for each of the 10  curved echelle orders .",
    "this process yielded an empirical measurement of the spatial pixel scale for each order : it varies from @xmath23 in the bluest order to @xmath24 in the reddest order .",
    "scattered light was subtracted from individual frames by fitting a smooth function to the areas outside these apertures ( spaces between echelle orders ) using the apscatter task . to preserve spatial information ,",
    "the apall task was used in `` strip '' mode to extract and rectify two - dimensional rectangular strips for each echelle order by shifting and aligning each spatial column based on the aperture trace information .",
    "the rectified orders were then interpolated to a common spatial pixel scale of @xmath24 per pixel .",
    "calibration frames such as flat field , arc lamp , and template star exposures were also extracted into rectified , aligned and spatially - corrected strips using the same procedure .",
    "data reduction was carried out on these rectified strips using procedures similar to those routinely used on long - slit spectra .",
    "each strip was divided by its corresponding normalized flat - field image ( from the same echelle order ) .",
    "cosmic rays on individual exposures , identified on the basis of object sharpness and peak pixel brightness , were masked and the exposures were then combined .",
    "each order was logarithmically binned in wavelength using a two - dimensional wavelength calibration ( i.e. ,  as a function of spatial position along the slit ) determined from a combined cu / ar / hg / ne arc lamp spectrum .",
    "the rms of the residuals in the wavelength solution is @xmath25 or less in each order .",
    "the sky spectrum was determined for each combined frame from a section near the end of the slit farthest from the galaxy center ( @xmath26 ) , and subtracted from the rest of the two - dimensional spectrum .",
    "we recognize that this `` sky '' spectrum is contaminated by light from the outer parts of the target de galaxy but this is unlikely to have a significant effect on our results .",
    "we estimate that the `` sky '' spectrum is contaminated by galaxy light at the level of @xmath27 and @xmath28 relative to the de s center , with and without the nuclear contribution , respectively . in the outer parts of the de profile ( @xmath29 ) , the contamination level is higher ( 20%30% ) , but even this should not be a problem since there are no strong radial gradients in the mean velocity and velocity dispersion in the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "] bright , poorly - subtracted sky lines were masked out during the kinematic fitting discussed below .",
    "the galaxy continuum flux in each order was then individually normalized to unity using the iraf continuum task .",
    "a noise frame was created for each galaxy spectrum which kept track of uncertainties in every pixel due to read noise and poisson noise taking into account the ccd gain and number of readouts .",
    "this noise frame is used as input into the kinematic analysis of  [ vp ] as part of the formal error calculations on the velocity profile parameters .",
    "finally , the strips from the different echelle orders were combined , weighted by the noise frame , to create a single two - dimensional long - slit spectrum . due to low signal - to - noise in the reddest and bluest echelle orders",
    ", we do not include them in the analysis ; the final combined spectrum covers @xmath30 .",
    "the spectra show no evidence for gaseous emission lines at any radii .",
    "representative combined galaxy spectra are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "the seeing fwhm during each spectroscopic observation was determined by comparing the observed intensity profile along the esi slit to high spatial resolution @xmath31-band surface brightness profiles derived from _",
    "hst _ images ( as discussed in  [ sb ] ) .",
    "these brightness profiles were convolved with a gaussian seeing point spread function ( psf ) , integrated over the @xmath32 slit width and binned into @xmath24 pixels to match the esi pixel scale in the spatial direction .",
    "this was then compared to the observed intensity profile along the esi slit in the matching spectral region .",
    "the best - fit gaussian fwhm seeing estimates are given in table  2 for each galaxy .",
    "these are consistent with the less accurate estimates of the seeing fwhm determined by coadding short ( few second ) exposures taken with the esi guider camera at intervals of approximately 5  minutes during the spectroscopic observations .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion as a function of radius were determined using a pixel - fitting method first described in @xcite .",
    "these quantities were determined by comparing the observed galaxy spectrum to a stellar template convolved with a series of gaussian line profiles .",
    "the best - fitting gaussian profile was determined by @xmath33 minimization in pixel space .",
    "the free parameters in this analysis are : mean line - of - sight velocity @xmath34 , velocity dispersion @xmath35 , and a line - strength parameter @xmath36 , which measures the ratio of equivalent width in the galaxy to that of the template star and accounts for template mismatch ( e.g. ,  due to differences in effective temperature or metallicity ) .",
    "night sky absorption features ( a and b bands ) and strong sky emission lines were masked out in the fitting procedure ; masked pixels were not included in the calculation of @xmath33 .",
    "deviations from gaussian profiles @xcite were not fit as this requires higher signal - to - noise spectra than presented in this paper .",
    "in addition , an arbitrary continuum term was simultaneously fit to the data approximated by the sum of legendre polynomials . in analyzing the combined esi spectra ( @xmath37  pixels ) ,",
    "the continuum was fit with a 20th order polynomial .",
    "we have tested this method on broadened template stars to determine the minimum signal - to - noise required to accurately recover velocity dispersions and to estimate our sensitivity to template mismatch .",
    "stellar templates were broadened with gaussian kernels of varying @xmath35 and poisson noise was added .",
    "these tests suggest that for a signal - to - noise level @xmath38 per spectral pixel , a galaxy s internal velocity dispersions can be measured down to the instrumental resolution of 23  km  s@xmath17  with an accuracy of 1% and down to 18.5 km  s@xmath17  with an accuracy of 10% .",
    "we have spatially rebinned our galaxy data to achieve a signal - to - noise level of @xmath39 per pixel at all radii , while ensuring that the spatial bin size is at least as large as the fwhm of seeing during the observations ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "velocity profiles were recovered using template stars ranging in spectral type g8iii to m0iii .",
    "the best fitting template , the k1iii star hd 40460 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath41 ) , was used to recover all profiles presented here .",
    "the choice of template star did not affect the recovered profiles at a level in excess of the formal error bars .",
    "we also find no significant difference between the profiles presented here to those determined by separately recovering profiles for the eight esi echelle orders and computing a profile based on the weighted mean .      we have previously attempted to observe virgo de galaxies with keck / hires in march 1998 .",
    "the significantly higher spectral resolution of hires ( 2.1  km  s@xmath17  pixel@xmath17 ) and its lower throughput as compared to esi made these observations prohibitively difficult .",
    "the de galaxies vcc  1254 , vcc  1073 , vcc  452 and vcc  1876 were observed for 5 , 3 , 2 and 1.8  hours , respectively , through a custom - made @xmath42 slit .",
    "we were able to determine the kinematics for vcc  1254 inside @xmath43 ; however , data for the last three  galaxies did not have sufficient signal - to - noise to recover velocity profiles .",
    "although this hires spectrum does not provide additional information on vcc  1254 , it does provide an excellent reliability check on our esi observations .",
    "the esi and hires data complement each other in that the esi data have relatively high s / n but an instrumental resolution approaching the intrinsic dispersion of our target galaxies , whereas the instrumental resolution of hires is significantly higher at the price of low signal - to - noise . as shown in figure  [ hires ] , the line profile shapes and velocity profiles determined with hires match that measured by esi .",
    "the velocity profiles were calculated in the wavelength region @xmath44@xmath45 , however , we have no reason to believe that this argreement would be any less in other spectral regions .",
    "_ hst _ wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) imaging is available for each of our target galaxies .",
    "these images provide high spatial resolution surface brightness profiles needed for the dynamical modeling discussed in  [ models ] , and allowed us to measure photometric properties for our target galaxies .",
    "the data , first presented in @xcite and @xcite , consist of @xmath46-s wfpc2 images in the f555w bandpass and a single 300-s exposure in f814w .",
    "the galaxies are centered on the wf3 ccd in the _ hst _ pointings , and we use only the f555w wf3 ccd image to determine surface brightness profiles .",
    "the images were cleaned of cosmic rays and combined .",
    "the instrumental f555w magnitudes were calibrated into @xmath31-band using the transformations of @xcite , assuming @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "surface brightness profiles were determined for each galaxy using the iraf ellipse isophotal fitting routine down to a surface brightness of @xmath48 .",
    "the average ellipticity , @xmath49 , determined between @xmath50 and the total integrated apparent magnitude , determined by integrating the total flux inside a @xmath51 aperture , are given in table  1 .",
    "our apparent magnitudes agree with those determined by @xcite . unlike @xcite , we consider vcc  1577 to be a nucleated de galaxy since its bright , central star cluster is within a few tenths of an arcsecond of the galaxy s isophotal centroid position .",
    "the observed surface brightness profiles are shown in figure  [ sbprof ] .      in subsequent analysis",
    ", we differentiate between light from the central de nucleus and the underlying galaxy .",
    "we therefore fit separate analytic profiles to the inner and outer surface brightness profiles . for the underlying galaxy",
    ", a sersic profile is fit of the form : @xmath52 $ ] , where a sersic index @xmath9 represents an exponential profile and @xmath10 is a de  vaucouleurs law . the best - fit sersic profile is determined by non - linear least - squares fitting to the region @xmath50 ; in this region , contributions from the nucleus and effects of the _ hst _ wfpc2 psf should be negligible .",
    "the resulting profiles are shown in figure  [ sbprof ] , and sersic indices and half - light effective radii are listed in table  3 .",
    "best - fitting sersic indices range between @xmath53 .",
    "there is a slight trend towards smaller @xmath54 values ( more closely exponential ) at fainter magnitudes , consistent with that seen in the much larger sample of virgo de surface brightness profiles analyzed by @xcite .    at the distance of the virgo cluster , the nuclei of de galaxies",
    "are slightly extended compared to the wfpc2 psf .",
    "we have used the ishape software developed by @xcite to derive shape parameters for these nuclei .",
    "the intrinsic shape of the nuclei was modeled as a plummer profile whose projected intensity scales as @xmath55 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath56 is the scale radius of the nucleus which , for this profile , is also the half - light radius .",
    "the ishape software convolves the analytic profile with the wpfc2 f555w psf and a diffusion kernel generated by the tinytim software @xcite , and determines the best - fitting model parameters by minimizing residuals between the model and original two - dimensional image .",
    "nuclear profiles were fit inside the central @xmath57 ( 10 pixels ) and were assumed to be circularly symmetric .",
    "the free model parameters are the effective radius , @xmath56 , the profile normalization , @xmath58 , and a constant background level .",
    "although a constant background level is a good approximation for the non - nuclear component inside the fitting radius , it is more appropriate to subtract the underlying galaxy sersic profile .",
    "therefore , we use the ishape software to fit only the profile shape , @xmath56 , and determine the profile normalization , @xmath59 , such that the total nuclear magnitude equals the luminosity leftover after subtraction of the galaxy sersic profile from the total observed surface brightness profile .",
    "for the five nucleated des , the resulting nuclear profiles are plotted as dotted lines in figure  [ sbprof ] ; effective half - light radii and total nuclear magnitudes are given in table  3 .",
    "results of the kinematic analysis of  [ vp ] are shown for all galaxies in figure  [ vp_fig ] ; the derived kinematic profiles are summarized in table  4 .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion are plotted as a function of major axis radius in arcseconds ; the radius was measured relative to the peak position of the intensity profile along the esi slit .",
    "the systemic radial velocity of each de was determined from the mean of the velocity data points and subtracted from the velocity profile .",
    "the corrected heliocentric velocities are listed in table  4 and agree , within measurement errors , with previously published radial velocity measurements for vcc  917 , vcc  1073 , vcc  1254 and vcc  1876 @xcite .",
    "the velocity profiles in figure  [ vp_fig ] show no evidence for substantial rotation along the major axis of any of the six de systems observed . to quantify the maximum rotation velocity allowed by the data",
    ", we have differenced the average velocities on either side of the major axis of the galaxy and divided by two ( @xmath60 in table  4 ) .",
    "this quantity is not particularly meaningful for galaxies which do not show a coherent rotation curve ; it merely represents an upper limit on rotational motion .",
    "error bars on rotational motion were determined by adding in quadrature the error of the mean velocity on either side of the major axis .",
    "if the observed flattening of these galaxies were determined by rotational motion alone , the expected rotation velocity can be calculated directly from the tensor virial theorem , given the observed velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the maximum rotational velocity to the average velocity dispersion ( @xmath61 ) is plotted versus ellipticity in figure  [ rotation ] and compared to the ratio expected from an isotropic , rotationally - flattened body .",
    "ellipticity and average velocity dispersion are determined outside @xmath62 in order to exclude any contributions from a central nucleus and are listed in tables  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath61 determined for these galaxies are significantly smaller than expected if the observed flattenings were due to rotation .",
    "thus , from figure  [ rotation ] we conclude that these des are primarily flattened by anisotropic velocity dispersions .",
    "the low rotation velocities of this study are consistent with previous measurements of de velocity profiles in the local group @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies of de kinematics suggest that a fraction of de galaxies are rotationally supported . a rotational velocity of 15 km  s@xmath17  was measured by @xcite for fs  76 , a de in the fornax cluster , slightly below the value expected if this system is rotationally supported .",
    "@xcite found that five of their six virgo cluster des rotated with maximum velocities between 15 to 30 km  s@xmath17 , placing them on or above the relation for rotational support .",
    "the sixth galaxy presented by @xcite , ic  794 or vcc  1073 , is also in our sample .",
    "their measurement , @xmath63 km  s@xmath17 , is consistent with our observation of low rotation velocity , @xmath64 km  s@xmath17 .",
    "thus , of the 11 virgo des with measured velocity profiles , 5 have significant rotation velocities and 6 are non - rotating .",
    "we note that the average brightness of the rotating de sample ( @xmath65 , assuming ( b - v ) = 0.8 @xcite ) is slightly brighter than that of our non - rotating des ( @xmath66 ) . in  [ fp ] we find that these two populations are also slightly separated in the fundamental plane . we have recently observed a larger sample of virgo de galaxies , some of which have significant rotation velocities and some which do not",
    ". we will explore in more depth the differences between these two classes in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the mean velocity dispersions of the six de galaxies presented in figure  [ vp_fig ] lie between 20 and 55  km  s@xmath17 , and show a wide range of profile shapes .",
    "although virgo de nuclei are unresolved from the ground , the kinematics of the central nucleus appear to be distinguished from the underlying galaxy .",
    "surprisingly , the central velocity dispersion can be either larger ( vcc  1254 ) or smaller ( vcc  1073 , vcc  452 ) than the surrounding galaxy .",
    "below , we construct dynamical models for each of the observed galaxies in order to explore the range of mass - to - light ratios , velocity dispersion anisotropy and central black hole masses allowed by the observed profiles .",
    "high spatial resolution wfpc2 imaging available for all of the observed des (  [ sb ] ) allows dynamical modeling of the velocity dispersion profiles through the assumption that the stellar mass density is proportional to the luminosity density times some mass - to - light ratio at all radii . solving the spherically symmetric jeans equation ,",
    "the predicted kinematics are convolved through the observational setup , allowing a direct comparison to the observations .",
    "the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry is justified as more generalized models can not be discriminated against without additional information such as minor axis kinematics or higher order velocity profile moments .",
    "we produce spherical models in which the radius is related to the observed semimajor / semiminor axes and ellipticity of the corresponding de galaxy via the relation : @xmath67 .",
    "the square root of the product of the semi - major and minor axis is a more appropriate quantity than the semi - major axis for these elliptical systems .",
    "the models are based on dynamical software described in more detail by @xcite .",
    "the luminosity density , @xmath68 , is determined for each galaxy by abel transformation of the projected wfpc2 @xmath31-band surface brightness profile measured in  [ sb ] . to avoid noise amplification ,",
    "the observed surface brightness profiles were first fit to an arbitrary function , a generalization of the `` nuker law '' @xcite , as shown in figure  [ sbprof ] .",
    "the total luminosity density is assumed to be composed of two parts , @xmath69 , representing the central nucleus and underlying galaxy , respectively .",
    "we model the nuclear component as a plummer model with fixed scale length , @xmath56 , and total nuclear luminosity , @xmath70 in the @xmath31 band , as determined for each galaxy from the projected luminosity density in  [ sbfits ] .",

    ", we allow two distinct mass - to - light ratios as free parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , for the underlying galaxy and nuclear component .",
    "the mass density distribution of the galaxy component is then : @xmath76 .",
    "the mass density distribution of the nucleus is similarly defined as : @xmath77 .",
    "the total mass density of the system is the sum of these densities : @xmath78 . rearranging terms ,",

    "the total gravitational potential , @xmath82 , is obtained by integrating over the mass density determined by eqn .",
    "( [ rho ] ) plus an added possible contribution , @xmath83 , from a central black hole .",
    "the velocity dispersion as a function of radius , @xmath84 , is then obtained by solving the spherically - symmetric jeans equation : @xmath85 where @xmath86 describes the velocity dispersion anisotropy .",

    "the projected dispersions are convolved using monte carlo integration with a gaussian kernel to take into account the seeing fwhm ( as determined in  [ datared_sec ] ) .",

    "instead , we consider three limiting cases : ( 1 )  constant mass - to - light ratio and velocity anisotropy , ( 2 )  the same model plus a central black hole , and ( 3 )  models with separate mass - to - light ratios for the nucleus and underlying galaxy and no central black hole .",
    "we first consider models without a central black hole for which the free parameters are a single mass - to - light ratio @xmath97 ( i.e.  @xmath98 ) and velocity dispersion anisotropy , @xmath90 , both independent of radius .",
    "for each galaxy , models were run for values of the velocity dispersion anisotropy ranging between @xmath99 .",

    "best - fit models , as well as several representative @xmath90-value models are plotted over the observed data points in figure  [ aniso_models ] .",
    "although isotropic models ( @xmath101 ) do not fit the observed profiles in detail , such models do in general reproduce the dip or rise in the central dispersion observed in all six  de galaxies .",

    "this rough calculation suggests that the mass determined from the observed kinematics can be accounted for by stellar populations alone without the need for a significant dark matter component , at least inside the radius of our observations ( @xmath106 effective radius ) .",
    "this does not rule out a significant dark matter component at larger radii .",
    "accurate determination of the ages and metallicities of these galaxies requires a rigorous analysis of their line strengths and will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we next allow an additional free model parameter in the form of a central black hole with the goal of placing upper limits on the black hole mass allowed by our kinematic data . if , for example , des are the morphologically - transformed remnants of larger progenitor galaxies , limits on the central black hole mass can place potentially interesting constraints on such a progenitor population .",
    "models were run for a two - dimensional grid of velocity anisotropy versus black hole mass . for each grid point , the best fitting mass - to - light ratio is determined .",
    "contours of constant @xmath107 are shown for these two parameters in figure  [ bh_models ] .",
    "confidence intervals were assigned to @xmath107 values in a two dimensional parameter space , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "black hole masses greater than @xmath108 can be ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level . for most objects ,",
    "a zero mass black hole model is either the best fitting model , or statistically similar to the best fit at the 90% confidence level ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the galaxy vcc  1254 is the only de in which a non - zero black hole mass , @xmath110 , is a significantly better fit to the data than models without a central black hole .",
    "this does not necessarily imply the presence of a black hole , as we will show below that this profile is equally well fit by a model in which the mass - to - light ratio of the nucleus is larger than the underlying galaxy .",
    "in addition , although the upper limits on black hole mass determined in this section are robust , actual black hole mass determinations would require more complicated models which allow @xmath90 variations with radius .",
    "upper limits on central de black hole mass are compared , in figure  [ fig_sigbh ] , to the black hole mass - bulge velocity dispersion relationship , @xmath111 , derived for bulge - dominated galaxies @xcite .",
    "although this relationship may not be applicable to de galaxies , which lack a bulge component , our upper limits are still consistent with the relationship .",
    "the implication of these upper limits on possible de progenitor galaxies is discussed in  [ disc_sec ] .",
    "the kinematic profiles of the five nucleated des in figure  [ vp_fig ] show that the nuclei tend to have velocity dispersions distinct from the surrounding galaxy .",
    "in addition , photometric studies suggest that de nuclei tend to have different colors than the underlying light of the host de galaxy @xcite . motivated by these observations , we consider models allowing two distinct mass - to - light ratios , one for the nucleus , @xmath112 , and another for the underlying galaxy , @xmath74 .",
    "we explore only isotropic models ( @xmath113 ) and search for combinations of @xmath74 , @xmath75 which minimize @xmath96 . for vcc  1254 ,",
    "in which the nuclear dispersion is larger than the surrounding galaxy , the best fit nuclear mass - to - light ratio is twice that for the surrounding galaxy ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "this model fits the data equally well as the models presented in the previous two sections .",
    "however , a larger nuclear mass - to - light ratio implies an older , and therefore redder , stellar population , contrary to observations that the nucleus of vcc  1254 is bluer than the surrounding galaxy @xcite .",
    "the true dynamical state of vcc  1254 is likely to lie between the three extreme models presented in this and previous sections .",
    "for the four nucleated galaxies in which the velocity dispersion dips in the central regions ( vcc  452 , vcc  1073 , vcc  1577 , and vcc  1876 ) , a smaller nuclear mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath115 ) is only a marginally better fit to the data . in these four systems , we are not able to directly constrain the nuclear mass - to - light ratio .",
    "even the unphysical case in which the nucleus contributes no mass , isotropic models are inadequate fits to the profiles of vcc  452 and vcc  1073 , implying that these galaxies must have some degree of tangential velocity anisotropy .",
    "isotropic , single mass - to - light ratio models are adequate fits to the profiles of vcc  1577 and vcc  1876 , and variations in @xmath75 do not significantly improve the fit .",
    "this can be understood because the nuclear component does not dominate the observed spectroscopic light of these galaxies , not even in the central data point . inside @xmath116",
    ", the nucleus contributes between 5% and 25% of the total light in this region , as compared to 60% for vcc  1254 .",
    "thus , the measured central velocity dispersion is not a good estimate of the velocity dispersion of the nucleus . in order to place these nuclei on the fundamental plane ( see  [ fp_nuc ] ) , we do need an estimate of the nuclear velocity dispersions .",
    "for this , we assume a nuclear mass - to - light ratio equal to the galaxy ( @xmath117 ) and calculate the central projected velocity dispersion for a plummer model @xcite with total luminosity and scale radius as determined in ",
    "[ sbfits ] .",
    "the resulting nuclear velocity dispersions are given in table  4 .",
    "in the multivariate space defined by central velocity dispersion , @xmath118 , effective surface brightness , @xmath119 , and effective radius , @xmath120 , de galaxies occupy a region of the so - called fundamental plane distinct from classical elliptical galaxies .",
    "the separation is best demonstrated by the @xmath121-space projection of this parameter space defined by @xcite as : @xmath122 + \\log r_{\\rm eff } ) / \\sqrt2\\ ] ] @xmath123 + 2 \\log i_{\\rm eff } - \\log r_{\\rm eff})/\\sqrt6\\ ] ] @xmath124 - \\log i_{\\rm eff } - \\log r_{\\rm eff})/\\sqrt3\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is defined as @xmath126 and is the mean intensity inside the radius @xmath120 .",
    "these coordinates are related to physical quantities as follows : @xmath127 is proportional to the logarithm of mass , @xmath128 is proportional to the effective surface brightness times mass - to - light ratio and @xmath129 is proportional to the logarithm of mass - to - light ratio . to compare the location of our des in the fundamental plane to other galaxy types , we plot data compiled by @xcite for classical ellipticals , spiral bulges , previously observed des , dwarf spheroidals and globular clusters .",
    "these data have been compiled in the @xmath130-band . for comparison ,",
    "we transform our de data to the @xmath130-band assuming @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we add four of the five rotating de galaxies presented by @xcite for which photometric data is available .",
    "photometric properties for ugc  7436/vcc  543 were determined from wfpc2 imaging as in  [ sbfits ] .",
    "the properties of the remaining objects were taken from @xcite .      as seen in the edge - on , @xmath127 vs.  @xmath129 , view of the fundamental plane ( lower left panel , fig .",

    "[ fp_fig ] ) , des lie in a very different region of this plane , on a sequence perpendicular to the locus of classical ellipticals .",
    "the offset in @xmath129 was first noted by @xcite and can be interpreted as either non - homology between dwarf and classical ellipticals or as a difference in mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we have shown in figure  [ fig_ml ] that des tend to have larger mass - to - light ratios at a given absolute magnitude compared to classical ellipticals , favoring the latter interpretation of the @xmath129 offset . comparing our non - rotating des to the rotating des of @xcite",
    ", these two groups lie in slightly different regions of the fundamental plane .",
    "the rotating des lie at larger @xmath127 and @xmath129 than the non - rotating sample , suggesting that they have both higher masses and mass - to - light ratios . from the location of the rotating des in the fundamental plane , these galaxies are not part of the low luminosity extension of classical ellipticals known to be rotationally - supported @xcite .",
    "thus , des appear to have a wider range of rotational properties than previously assumed .",
    "the separation in both luminosity and fundamental plane space between these two samples suggests a correlation between rotation and another physical quantity , possibly mass . however , more data is required to establish such a correlation .      in the right panels of figure  [ fp_fig ] ,",
    "the nuclei of the five observed nucleated des are plotted . unlike the underlying de galaxies in the fundamental plane , de nuclei lie nearest to the region occupied by globular clusters .",
    "these @xmath121-space parameters were calculated using central velocity dispersions determined directly from a plummer model fit to the nucleus .",
    "this is a more accurate estimate of the nuclear velocity dispersion than the measured central velocity dispersion , but requires the assumption that the nuclear mass - to - light ratio equals that of the galaxy , as discussed in  [ nuc_vs_gal_sec ] .",
    "this assumption most strongly affects values of @xmath129 .",
    "however , for any reasonable assumed nuclear mass - to - light ratio , the de nuclei lie closest to globular clusters in the all three @xmath121 indices .",
    "the absolute luminosities of these de nuclei ( @xmath132 ) are as bright or brighter than the most luminous galactic globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the nuclear effective radii are also larger than an average galactic globular cluster , but are smaller than the largest known globulars .",
    "the resulting central luminosity densities of de nuclei , determined from the plummer models , are comparable to the average globular cluster central luminosity density .",
    "the position of the best studied de nucleus , that of the local group de ngc  205 , a well - resolved supermassive star cluster of intermediate age and absolute magnitude @xmath133 @xcite , is also plotted on the fundamental plane .",
    "this nucleus lies squarely in the region occupied by globular clusters .",
    "the offset position of the virgo de nuclei , particularly in the face - on view of the fundamental plane ( top right panel fig .",
    "[ fp_fig ] ) , relative to galactic globular clusters is most likely due to larger nuclear masses .",
    "velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are presented for the major axes of six de galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "these galaxies do not show evidence for substantial rotation ; upper limits on rotation velocities are well below that expected if these objects were rotationally flattened .",
    "dynamical models for these galaxies suggest mass - to - light ratios in the range @xmath134 .",
    "we argue that such ratios are expected for intermediate to old stellar populations and thus these des do not require significant dark matter inside an effective radius .",
    "our observations do not rule out significant dark matter in des at larger radii as demonstrated by giant elliptical galaxies which exist in massive dark halos , but are not necessarily dark matter dominated at small radii @xcite . in fundamental plane space ,",
    "we find that the virgo de galaxies , similar to previously observed des , lie in a plane parallel to , but offset from , that occupied by normal elliptical galaxies . in this space ,",
    "de nuclei lie near the region occupied by galactic globular clusters .",
    "the origin of nuclei in de galaxies remains an open question . in the present sample",
    ", there is no obvious difference between the single non - nucleated de galaxy ( vcc  917 ) and the underlying galaxies of the observed nucleated des .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio , anisotropy , and photometric parameters measured for vcc  917 are indistinguishable from those determined outside the nucleus of the other five des . however , as a population , non - nucleated de galaxies in the virgo cluster do have different properties .",
    "they are observed to be less spatially concentrated , have lower specific globular cluster frequencies , and , on average , have flatter shapes as compared to nucleated de galaxies @xcite .",
    "proposed scenarios for the origin of de nuclei include the remnant cores of larger stripped galaxies @xcite , the results of gas infall and star formation or the coalescence of several globular clusters whose orbits have decayed to the de center @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the observed de nuclei share many properties with globular clusters , suggesting similar formation processes .",
    "since de galaxies are preferentially found in dense environments , it is likely that galaxy interactions play a large role in their formation and evolution .",
    "the models of @xcite suggest that galaxy harassment in clusters can morphologically transform a spiral galaxy into a dwarf elliptical .",
    "harassment tends to increase internal velocity dispersions , but is less efficient in disrupting rotational motion and is not obviously reconciled with the low rotational velocities observed in the present de sample . if des are the morphologically - transformed remnants of larger progenitor galaxies , a constraint on such a progenitor population is provided by the central black hole mass limits determined in  [ bh_sec ] .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath4 for the observed de galaxies implies that any de progenitor must have had a bulge dispersion less then 100 km  s@xmath17 , assuming the @xmath111 relation @xcite .",
    "although this is not a stringent constraint on de galaxy formation models , higher spatial resolution kinematics , and therefore more stringent mass limits , could be a significant constraint on such models .    as the number of de galaxies with measured internal kinematics increases , their position in the fundamental plane strengthens the conclusion that dwarf and classical elliptical galaxies evolve via very different physical processes . to determine whether dwarf ellipticals",
    "as a galaxy class evolve under homogeneous conditions requires more observations",
    ". a critical question is understanding the apparent dichotomy between the anisotropy - supported des presented in this paper and the rotationally - supported des presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that rotating and non - rotating des appear to form a `` sequence '' in fundamental plane space , with the latter having somewhat lower mean luminosity , mass , and mass - to - light ratio , suggests that these are not two distinct types of de galaxies but rather are part of a continuous family .",
    "larger samples are required to establish what , if any , physical property correlates with the observed rotational velocities and what this implies for de galaxy formation .",
