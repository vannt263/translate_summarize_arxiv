    "phenomena in spin glasses represent one of the central topics of modern solid state physics ; they are of fundamental interest and also have a variety of possible applications @xcite .",
    "the spin - glass state is realized in intermetallic alloys , for instance , when ions of a magnetic metal ( like fe , mn ) are introduced in small amounts into the matrix of non - magnetic noble metals ( like au , ag , cu , pt ) .",
    "the local magnetic moments interact co - operatively with each other via the conduction electrons by the agency of the indirect ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "magnitude and sign of the interaction depend on the distance between impurities . combined with the spatial disorder",
    "this provides conditions for a spin - glass state .    among the exceptional properties of spin glasses compared to other magnetic materials",
    "is the temperature behavior of their magnetic susceptibility , which reveals a kink at a certain temperature @xmath2 ( the freezing temperature ) whose shape and position depend on the magnitude and alternation frequency of the probing field @xcite .",
    "spin glasses possess magnetic memory : the magnitude of magnetization created by an external magnetic field below @xmath2 depends on the pre - history of the system .",
    "typical for a spin - glass state are relaxational phenomena with characteristic times which at low temperatures can by far exceed the duration of the experiment . in spite of the large number of theoretical and experimental investigations , there is still no generally accepted consensus on the nature of the spin - glass state and the majority of properties of spin glasses remain not fully understood @xcite .",
    "since the rkky interaction plays a fundamental role in the physics of spin glasses , the behavior of the subsystem of free electrons should be intimately linked to the formation and stabilization of the spin - glass phase .",
    "the magnitude of the rkky interaction depends on the electronic mean free path , as was first shown by de gennes @xcite .",
    "thus , investigating the characteristics of conduction electrons gives insight into the peculiar physics of spin glasses .",
    "the most direct way to study the properties of delocalized electrons is provided by electrical transport experiments . immediately following the first works on spin glasses , the electrical resistance of `` classical '' systems like aufe , cumn , aumn , and aucr has been investigated in a detailed and systematic way as a function of temperature , magnetic field and concentration of magnetic centers @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the magnetic contribution to the electrical resistivity @xmath3 reveals a @xmath4 temperature dependence at the lowest temperatures and a @xmath5 dependence close to @xmath2 ; at elevated temperatures @xmath6 there is a broad maximum in @xmath3 which is due to a competition between kondo and rkky interactions in the subsystems of electrons and magnetic moments .",
    "existing theories encounter serious difficulties to reproduce the temperature behavior of the resistivity in broad intervals of temperatures and impurity concentrations @xcite .",
    "certain difficulties are also caused by deviations from matthiessen s rule at elevated temperatures .",
    "fundamental information on the properties of the electronic subsystem can be obtained by optical spectroscopy , which for instance allows one to extract such characteristics of free carriers as mechanisms of scattering and relaxation , energy gaps and pseudogaps in the density of states , localization and hopping parameters , size and granularity effects in thin conducting films @xcite . however , to our knowledge , there are no data published on optical spectroscopy of spin glasses . the reason may be purely technical : since these materials are highly conducting , almost like regular metals , it is practically impossible to measure their electrodynamic properties by standard spectroscopical techniques , especially in the far - infrared range and at even lower frequencies where effects of interactions of mobile electrons with localized spins and between these spins should reveal themselves . here",
    "we present the first measurements of the electrodynamic response of the spin - glass compound aufe in a broad range of frequencies with an emphasis on the thz range corresponding to energies of the radiation quanta which are close to the rkky binding energy .",
    "for the measurements we have chosen the well - studied spin - glass compound aufe . a set of films with different thicknesses and fe concentrations was prepared .",
    "the high purity metals were co - sputtered onto a high - resistive si substrate ( size @xmath7  mm@xmath8 , thickness about 0.5  mm ) . before the argon sputter gas was admitted the equipment",
    "was pumped down to uhv conditions ( @xmath9  torr ) to prevent oxidation of the films during fabrication .",
    "the films were analyzed using rutherford backscattering and electron microprobe analysis ; the thickness and composition was homogeneous . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the results obtained for an aufe film with 6 at.%  of fe and about 50 nm thickness .",
    "we also measured a pure au film of the same thickness prepared under the same conditions .    for the thz investigations",
    "a coherent source spectrometer @xcite was used which operates in the frequency range from 30 ghz up to 1.5 thz ( 1 - 50  ) .",
    "this range is covered by a set of backward - wave oscillators as powerful sources of radiation whose frequency can be continuously tuned within certain limits . in a quasioptical arrangement the complex ( amplitude and phase )",
    "transmission and reflection coefficients can be measured at temperatures from 2  k to 1000  k and in a magnetic field up to 8  tesla if required .",
    "dynamical conductivity of au and aufe films was directly determined from thz transmissivity and reflectivity spectra in a way we have used for measurements other conducting films , like heavy fermions @xcite or superconductors @xcite .    in order to complete our overall picture ,",
    "the samples were optically characterized up to the ultraviolet .",
    "the room temperature experiments were conducted on the same au and aufe films as the thz investigations . in the infrared spectral range ( @xmath10  ) ,",
    "optical reflectivity r@xmath11 measurements were performed using an infrared microscope connected to a bruker ifs 66v fourier transform spectrometer .",
    "an aluminum mirror served as reference , whose reflectivity was corrected by the literature data @xcite .",
    "a woollam vertical variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer ( vase ) equipped with a berek compensator was utilized to measure in the energy range between 5000  and 33000  with a resolution of 200  under multiple angles of incident between 65@xmath12 and 85@xmath12 . from the ellipsometric measurements we obtain the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index which then allow us to directly evaluate any optical parameter like the reflectivity @xmath13 or the conductivity @xmath14 .",
    "to analyze the frequency dependent transport , we first consider the room temperature results displayed in fig .  [ fig : opticalspectra ] .",
    "it is seen that the spectra for both au and aufe are metallic @xcite : the reflectivity reveals a characteristic plasma edge around 20000  and the conductivity @xmath14 is only weekly frequency dependent at low frequencies and quickly drops between @xmath15  and @xmath16  .",
    "the increase of the conductivity at even higher frequencies ( above @xmath17  ) is caused by electronic interband transitions . in order to extract the microscopic characteristics of charge carriers",
    ", we fitted the spectra by the drude model of conductivity @xcite : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the dc conductivity and @xmath20 the relaxation time and @xmath21 the relaxation rate of charge carriers ( c is the speed of light ) .",
    "the higher frequency interband transitions were roughly modelled by additional lorentz oscillators .",
    "the results of the fit are presented by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : opticalspectra ] , the parameters are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "as indicated by the dotted lines , both the reflectivity and conductivity spectra can be perfectly reproduced by a more advanced procedure based on the variational analysis of the optical reflectivity and conductivity spectra introduced by kuzmenko @xcite .",
    "the low - frequency conductivity is smaller and the scattering rate of carriers larger ( more than ten times ) in aufe compared to au .",
    "obviously , the differences should be ascribed to additional magnetic scattering of electrons in aufe .",
    "although the plasma frequency is not affected when fe is diluted in au , the distribution of spectral weight ( as measured by the center of gravity , for instance ) is shifted to higher energies .",
    "ccccc film & @xmath19 ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) & @xmath21 ( ) & @xmath24 ( s ) & @xmath25 ( ) + au & 350500 &  236 & @xmath26 & 70450 + aufe &  33600 & 2445 & @xmath27 & 70100 +    the temperature dependence of the transport characteristics is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperaturedependence ] .",
    "the upper panel compares the ac resistivity @xmath28 = 1/@xmath14 of the aufe ( 6 at.%  fe ) and au films to the dc resistivity of a bulk aufe ( with slightly different fe concentration of 5 at.% ) and of pure bulk au samples ( data from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "first , it is obvious that at all temperatures the resistivity of our aufe film is very close to that of the bulk material : for example , at room temperature @xmath29 cm and @xmath30 cm .",
    "the same holds for the pure au samples : @xmath31 cm and @xmath32 cm .",
    "this agreement indicates the very good quality of our thin films and that there are basically no effects on their ac electrical properties connected with a possible granular structure .",
    "the same conclusion is also drawn from the measurements of the freezing temperatures @xmath33  k of our aufe film which appears to be basically the same as those for bulk samples .",
    "furthermore , it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : temperaturedependence ] that at all temperatures the resistivity of aufe is much larger than the resistivity of au ; the difference increases when cooling down .",
    "this is a consequence of scattering of the charge carriers on magnetic impurities that prevails over phonon scattering in the entire temperature range .",
    "the resistivity @xmath3 reveals a broad feature around @xmath34  k which is ascribed to the interplay of kondo and rkky regimes @xcite . at high temperatures thermal excitations",
    "exceed the rkky energy of interacting impurities and a kondo - like scattering of electrons on independent magnetic moments dominates .",
    "this leads to a weak increase of the magnetic contribution to the resistivity @xmath35 upon cooling as demonstrated by the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperaturedependence]b where the difference @xmath36 is plotted . at low temperatures",
    "the rkky interaction between magnetic moments starts to surmount and causes a noticeable suppression of the magnetic contribution to the resistivity . assuming matthiessen s rule @xcite , the scattering rate of electrons due to magnetic interaction in aufe at @xmath37  k can be calculated as @xmath38  .    in the low temperature regime ,",
    "also the frequency dependent conductivity of aufe is distinct from the room temperature behavior as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : thzspectra ] where the thz spectra of @xmath14 for aufe are presented . above approximately 100  k , @xmath14 is basically frequency independent in accordance with the drude model which predicts a constant conductivity for frequencies much smaller than the scattering rate @xcite , as sketched in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : thzspectra ] by the solid line ; the scattering rate for aufe equals 2445  at 300  k ( table [ tab:1 ] ) , i.e. , far above the range of frequencies presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : thzspectra ] .",
    "this changes drastically for @xmath39  k , when the conductivity @xmath14 increases towards high frequencies .",
    "we associate this conductivity dispersion with a pseudogap which appears in the free electron excitations when the rkky interaction between fe centers mediated by the conduction electrons sets in . in a simple picture",
    "the electrons which participate in the rkky interaction can be regarded as being to some extent bound to ( or localized between ) the corresponding pairs of magnetic moments , as long as the thermal energy @xmath40 does not exceed this `` binding energy '' which should be of order of the rkky interaction @xmath41 .",
    "this will lead to a corresponding reduction of the dc conductivity and also of the ac conductivity for frequencies below @xmath42 . at higher frequencies , @xmath43 ,",
    "the electrons will no longer be affected ( and localized ) by the rkky interaction and hence the conductivity @xmath14 should increase around @xmath44 to approach the unperturbed value .",
    "in other words , one would expect a gap - like feature to appear in the conductivity spectrum , as depicted by the dashed line in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : thzspectra ] .",
    "the rkky energy is approximately given by the freezing temperature @xmath2 @xcite , which for aufe ( 6 at.%  of fe ) is about 25 k @xcite , yielding @xmath45  mev .",
    "for the characteristic frequency we then obtain @xmath46  ( 510 ghz ) .",
    "this falls just in the range where the dispersion of the conductivity of aufe in the spin - glass state is observed .",
    "the effect amounts to approximately 10% , meaning that about one tenth of the conduction electrons participate in the rkky interaction .",
    "according to our picture of spin - glass systems , the conduction electrons experience two effects from the rkky interaction mediated by these electrons .",
    "on one hand , a decrease of the resistivity is commonly observed while cooling below @xmath2 because the rkky correlations between magnetic moments progressively suppress the kondo - type scattering . on the other hand , a certain fraction of carriers",
    "is increasingly bound to the magnetic moments by participating in the rkky interaction and is thus taken out of the conduction channel .",
    "the competing character of the two effects is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : thzspectra ] : while cooling down , the gap - like feature appears on top of a background conductivity which increases basically at all shown frequencies . in order to verify our assumptions ,",
    "a comprehensive study is required on various spin - glass materials with different freezing temperature and consequently different @xmath47 .",
    "the optical spectra of pure gold and spin glass aufe ( 6 at.%  fe ) films have been investigated in a broad frequency range from 10  up to 33000  using three different spectroscopic techniques . at ambient temperature the microscopic charge - carrier parameters in pure gold and in aufe",
    "are determined . for the spin glass aufe the scattering rate of the carriers",
    "is significantly enlarged due to their interaction with localized magnetic moments . at reduced temperatures",
    "( @xmath39  k ) when the rkky interaction gains importance as the spin - glass state is formed , a pseudogap feature in the optical conductivity spectrum is detected of a magnitude close to the rkky energy in aufe .",
    "we associate the origin of the pseudogap with partial localization of those electrons which are involved in the rkky interaction between magnetic moments .",
