    "let us split the diagonal and the non - diagonal contributions to the overall sum over eigenstates : @xmath176 the diagonal elements of @xmath90 are always positive , and so is @xmath70 . according to the simulations , the term @xmath177 is negative such that @xmath175 is positive .",

    "[ fig : factorized ] is indeed the result of an interplay of the positive diagonal entries in @xmath70 and the mostly negative ones in @xmath177 . in 1d",
    "both terms decay logarithmically but the sum @xmath178 stays constant over a long time . in three dimensions",
    "the terms behave completely different .",
    "this shows that the presence or absence of dynamical localization is fully coded in the matrix @xmath90 , i.e. depends on the properties of eigenvectors of @xmath60 , and not so much on its spectrum .",
    "it is strongly dominated by the scalar products of eigenvectors to different eigenvalues ( which are not orthogonal since @xmath60 is not symmetric ) entering the non - diagonal terms , and in this sense indeed has to do with eigenvector localization , although the direct relation is not clear yet .",
    "in the present work we applied an algebraic approach to investigate the phenomenon of dynamical localization in the random trap model with power - law distributed mean waiting times . apart from its formal elegance , the approach works extremely well as a computational scheme , since it allows for obtaining numerically exact results for the participation ratio @xmath33 averaged over initial conditions and thermal histories in a given system s realization . only a single averaging procedure over the samples",

    "because this approach enables us to compute the relevant properties at any given time , it allows for considering longer observation times than in the direct monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the phenomenon of dynamical localization , as observed in the participation ratio , is a very peculiar property of one - dimensional trap models .",
    "its physical interpretation is that the probability , that two particles with the same starting position are found together , is surprisingly high for intermediate time scales . in this context , _ intermediate time scales _ means that full equilibration is not yet established .",
    "the fact , that the particles often meet at the same site , does not mean that they stay close to each other : the typical distance between the particles continuously grows with time until the terminal equilibration is reached .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium state , which is the strongest localized one with respect to @xmath33 , is essentially delocalized with respect to its radius of gyration and its lyapunov exponent .",
    "numerical simulations show that the later two are well - correlating localization measures for the eigenstates of the system .",
    "we have moreover shown , that the phenomenon of dynamical localization is only marginally connected with the spectral properties of the laplacian operator governing the system s dynamics , and is dominated by the properties of the eigenfunctions of @xmath60 , which outlines the direction of further investigations .",
