    "for purposes of wireless communication , the electromagnetic spectrum is typically first divided into a large number of bands by regulatory agencies such as the fcc or the european commission .",
    "these bands are typically allocated by executive fiat or auction , and for particular purposes .",
    "once allocated , these bands are usually further divided into many smaller bands that individual users have access to .",
    "this entire process has a major impact on the efficiency with which spectral resources are used , but historically appears to have been done in a mostly ad hoc manner .",
    "this paper attempts to develop a theoretical basis for bandwidth partitioning , in particular the second partitioning of an allocated band into subbands .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider a spatially distributed wireless network , representing either an ad hoc network or an unlicensed ( and uncoordinated ) spectrum system , e.g. , 802.11 .",
    "in such systems it is common to have a fixed total bandwidth , a large number of potential users , and a limit on acceptable packet loss rates .",
    "it is also typical to have a target data rate for each user , either to support a certain application or due to user expectations .",
    "this gives rise to the following basic question : given bandwidth @xmath0 and a fixed rate requirement @xmath1 for each transmitter - receiver link in the network , how many slots @xmath2 of size @xmath3 should this band be partitioned into in order to maximize the number of links ( i.e. , spatial density of transmissions ) that can achieve this rate @xmath1 at a specified outage probability ( i.e. , packet error rate ) ?",
    "for example , given 1 mhz of bandwidth and a desired rate of 1 mbps , should ( a ) each transmitter utilize the entire spectrum and thus require an sinr of 1 ( utilizing @xmath4 bits / sec ) , ( b ) the band be split into two 0.5 mhz sub - bands where each transmitter utilizes one of the sub - bands with a required sinr of 3 , or ( c ) the band be split into @xmath5 orthogonal @xmath6 mhz sub - bands where each transmitter utilizes one of the sub - bands with a required sinr of @xmath7 ?    increasing the number of sub - bands @xmath2 has two competing effects . on the positive side",
    ", it allows for parallel , non - interfering communications on different sub - bands . on the negative side ,",
    "transmitting at the same data rate over less bandwidth requires each transmission to be performed at a higher spectral efficiency ( @xmath1 bps over @xmath8 hz corresponds to a spectral efficiency of @xmath9 bps / hz ) , which translates to a higher sinr requirement and thus a larger interference - free area .",
    "the objective of this paper is understanding this tradeoff and characterizing the optimum value of @xmath2 in terms of the system parameters .      to allow for analytical tractability , we optimize the number of sub - bands for a network consisting of transmitter - receiver pairs distributed on the two - dimensional plane .",
    "more specifically , the network we consider has the following key characteristics :    * transmitter locations are a realization of a homogeneous spatial poisson process . *",
    "each transmitter communicates with a single receiver that is a distance @xmath10 meters away . *",
    "all transmissions occur at power @xmath11 and rate @xmath1 bits / sec , the noise spectral density is @xmath12 , and attenuation follows path - loss exponent @xmath13 . *",
    "the system bandwidth of @xmath0 hz is divided into @xmath2 equal sub - bands of @xmath8 hz , and each transmission occurs on a randomly chosen sub - band . *",
    "each receiver treats multi - user interference as noise , and thus a transmission is successful if and only if the received sinr is larger than a threshold determined by @xmath14 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the second to last assumption should make it clear that we are considering only an _ off - line _ optimization of the frequency band structure , and that no on - line ( e.g. , channel- and queue - based ) transmission or sub - band decisions are considered .    by considering such a network , tools from stochastic geometry",
    "can be used to characterize the distribution of received interference and thus to quantify the success probability of each transmission as a function of the transmitter density and the sinr threshold . in this context , the question at hand is determining the value of @xmath2 that maximizes success probability for a given spatial density of transmitters .",
    "rather than considering the optimization in terms of @xmath2 , it is convenient to pose the problem in terms of the _ spectral efficiency _ of each communication @xmath9 .",
    "our main result is an exact characterization of the optimal spectral efficiency in the form of a simple fixed point equation .",
    "furthermore , the optimal spectral efficiency is seen to be a function only of the path - loss exponent and the energy per information bit @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the received power , @xmath12 is the noise spectral density , and @xmath1 is the rate @xcite ) , and thus is independent of the transmitter density . in order for a network to operate optimally , @xmath2 should be increased until the spectral efficiency @xmath17 is equal to its optimal value .",
    "when thermal noise is negligible relative to the received signal power ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , the network is purely interference - limited and the optimal spectral efficiency is a function of the path loss exponent ( @xmath13 ) alone . for reasonable path loss exponents the optimal spectral efficiency lies between the low - snr and high - snr regimes . for example , the optimal is @xmath19 bps / hz ( sinr threshold of @xmath20 db ) and @xmath21 bps / hz ( sinr threshold of @xmath22 db ) for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "when thermal noise is not negligible ( i.e. , @xmath25 is small ) , the optimal spectral efficiency is shown to be the fraction @xmath26 of the maximum spectral efficiency achievable in the absence of interference .",
    "increasing @xmath2 , which corresponds to decreasing the bandwidth and increasing the area consumed by each transmission , is seen to be beneficial as long as area ( i.e. , the sinr threshold ) increases at a reasonable rate with @xmath2 .",
    "for interference - limited networks this is true until the high - snr regime is reached , at which point a huge sinr increase is required for any additional bandwidth reduction . for power - limited networks this is true until the sinr threshold approaches the interference - free snr , at which point the system becomes overly sensitive to interference .",
    "the problem studied in this work is essentially the optimization of frequency reuse in uncoordinated decentralized networks , which is a well studied problem in the context of centrally - planned cellular and other hierarchical networks ; see for example @xcite and references therein . in both settings",
    "the tradeoff is between the bandwidth utilized per cell or transmission  which is inversely proportional to the frequency reuse factor  and the achieved sinr / spectral efficiency per transmission .",
    "a key difference is that regular frequency reuse patterns can be used in cellular networks , whereas in an ad hoc or unlicensed network this is impossible .",
    "another crucial difference is in terms of analytical tractability .",
    "although there has been a tremendous amount of work on frequency reuse optimization for cellular networks , these efforts generally do not lead to clean analytical results . on the contrary , in this work we are able to derive simple analytical results for decentralized networks that cleanly show the dependence of the optimal reuse factor on basic system parameters .    a number of works have considered related problems in the context of decentralized networks , although none appear to have investigated the optimization considered here .",
    "in @xcite the time - bandwidth - area product achieved by different codes are evaluated .",
    "this metric is essentially equivalent to the inverse of transmission density in our network model , but the authors do not pursue optimization of this metric , which is the essence of our work . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors jointly optimize rate , transmitter - receiver distance ( @xmath10 ) , and density in order to maximize the transport capacity ( i.e. , product of rate and distance ) of a random - access network .",
    "this setting is very different from our framework in which we assume a fixed rate and transmitter - receive distance , and as a result conclusions differ significantly .",
    "for example , the optimum sinr threshold in @xcite for some networks is found to be orders of magnitude smaller than 0 db , whereas we find optimal values around 0 db . in @xcite",
    "a network consisting of a large number of interfering transmitter - receiver pairs is analyzed , but no spatial model is used and only fading is considered . in @xcite",
    "the issue of frequency reuse is considered in a one - dimensional , evenly spaced , multi - hop wireless network .",
    "some similar general insights are derived , but the regular spacing of interferers seems to prevent derivation of clean analytical results as is possible for the 2-d network considered here . in a recent contribution the interactions between multiple random - access networks have been considered from a game - theoretic perspective @xcite , and portions of the analysis of a single network in @xcite coincide with our initial findings reported earlier in @xcite .",
    "there has also been a good deal of work on multi - channel wireless networks , but this body of work generally deals with scheduled networks as opposed to our treatment of unscheduled networks ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps most relevant is @xcite , in which algorithms for _ dynamic _ allocation of bandwidth - area resources are proposed .",
    "we consider a set of transmitting nodes at an arbitrary snapshot in time with locations specified by a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) of intensity @xmath27 on the infinite 2-d plane .",
    "all nodes are assumed to simultaneously transmit with power @xmath11 . by the stationarity of the ppp",
    "it is sufficient to analyze the behavior of a single reference tx - rx pair ( tx 0 , rx 0 ) , separated by assumption by a distance @xmath10 .",
    "note that the receivers are not a part of the transmitter process . from the perspective of rx 0",
    ", the interferers follow the distribution of the ppp conditioned on the location of tx 0 ( referred to as the palm distribution ) .",
    "however , by slivnyak s theorem @xcite this distribution is the same as the unconditional distribution and therefore the locations of the interfering nodes form a homogeneous ppp of intensity @xmath27 .",
    "received power is modeled by path loss with exponent @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 denotes the distance of the @xmath30-th transmitting node to the reference receiver and the transmit signal of the @xmath30-th transmitter is denoted as @xmath31 , the reference received signal is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is additive gaussian noise with power @xmath34 .",
    "the resulting sinr therefore is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 indicates the point process describing the ( random ) interferer locations .",
    "if gaussian signaling is used , the received mutual information ( conditioned on interferer locations ) is @xmath37 bits / symbol . in the fixed rate setting considered here , the probability the received mutual information is smaller than the transmission rate is known to be a good approximation to packet error rate if strong channel coding is used @xcite , and thus is the primary metric in this work .",
    "a few comments in justification of our model are in order .",
    "although the model contains many simplifications to allow for tractability , it contains many of the critical elements of a real decentralized network .",
    "first , the spatial poisson distribution means that transmitting nodes are randomly and independently located ; this is reasonable in a network with indiscriminate node placement or substantial mobility assuming that no intelligent transmission scheduling is performed scheduling generally attempts to ensure that simultaneous transmissions are sufficiently separated in space , and thus can significantly change the spatial distribution of simultaneous transmissions .",
    "however , even simple scheduling protocols can incur considerable overhead and latency and thus unscheduled systems ( or systems using aloha - like protocols that make transmission decisions independent of interference conditions ) as considered here are of interest .",
    "this is particularly true when scheduling overhead begins to overtake the advantage of scheduling , as may be the case with high mobility or very bursty traffic .",
    "the assumptions of fixed tx - rx distances and no fading are often not reasonable , but as we discuss in section [ sec - fading ] our results also apply to networks with fading and/or variable distances in the interference - limited regime ( no thermal noise ) . furthermore , our results are reasonably accurate in the presence of non - negligible thermal noise when the fading and distance variation is not too large . finally , we note that fixed- rather than variable - rate communication is appropriate for some , but not necessarily all , settings , e.g. , single - hop communication with very stringent delay constraints . in other settings ( e.g. ,",
    "when delay constraints are less stringent ) variable rate communication is more appropriate ; optimizing bandwidth partitioning in this context is of interest but is outside the scope of this work .",
    "an outage occurs whenever the sinr falls below threshold @xmath38 , or equivalently whenever the received mutual information is smaller than @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the system - wide outage probability is : @xmath40 this quantity is computed over the distribution of transmitter positions and is an increasing function of the intensity @xmath27 .",
    "the sinr threshold @xmath38 and the noise power @xmath34 are treated as constants here , but are related to @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 in the following section .",
    "random variable @xmath41 is defined as the received interference raised to the power @xmath42 : @xmath43 which allows the outage probability to be written in terms of @xmath41 as : @xmath44 it is useful to write this expression in terms of a _",
    "normalized _ interferer process .",
    "if we define @xmath45 as the received interference for a process with intensity @xmath46 : @xmath47 and note that a ppp with intensity @xmath27 is equivalent to a ppp with intensity @xmath46 scaled by @xmath48 , it follows that @xmath41 and @xmath49 have the same distribution .",
    "therefore @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the cdf of random variable @xmath45 .",
    "although a closed form expression for @xmath51 is not known except for the special case of @xmath24 @xcite , this characterization of the outage probability allows us to derive an exact solution to the bandwidth partition problem .    in many scenarios , the network is subject to an outage constraint and the quantity of interest is the maximum intensity of _ attempted _ transmissions @xmath52 such that the outage probability ( for a fixed @xmath38 ) is no larger than @xmath53 .",
    "because outage probability increases monotonically with density , an expression for @xmath52 is reached by inverting ( [ eq - outage_cdf ] ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the inverse of @xmath51 .",
    "because the sinr is upper bounded by only considering the contribution of the _ nearest _ interferer , a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for successful communication is that a circle centered about the receiver of area @xmath56 be free of interferers @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ effective area _ consumed by each transmission when an outage level of @xmath53 is required is the inverse of the density @xmath52 : @xmath57 which is the interferer - free area from the necessary condition above multiplied by the constant @xmath58 .",
    "this constant factor , which increases without bound as @xmath59 and which is larger than one for all but the largest values of @xmath53 , accounts for the fact that transmitters are randomly located and can be intuitively thought of as a back - off parameter that ensures the outage constraint is met .",
    "this interpretation turns out to be useful when interpreting bandwidth partitioning in terms of bandwidth and area .",
    "we are now able to address the problem of interest , which is determining the number of sub - bands that maximize the density of transmissions such that the outage probability is no larger than @xmath53 .",
    "as made explicit at the end of this section , finding the value of @xmath2 that minimizes outage probability for a fixed total density of transmitters is the dual of this problem and has precisely the same solution .",
    "for the reader s reference , the relevant system parameters are summarized in table [ table - parameters ] .",
    ".summary of system parameters [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     if the system bandwidth is not split ( @xmath60 ) , each node utilizes the entire bandwidth of @xmath0 hz .",
    "the sinr required ( @xmath38 ) to achieve a rate of @xmath1 bps is determined by inverting the awgn capacity expression @xmath61 , which gives @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum intensity of transmissions can be determined by evaluating ( [ eq - transcap ] ) with this value of @xmath38 and @xmath63 . if the system bandwidth is split into @xmath64 orthogonal sub - bands each of width @xmath8 , and each transmitter - receiver pair uses one _ randomly selected _ sub - band",
    ", the required sinr @xmath65 is determined by inverting the rate expression : @xmath66 because each transmitter randomly chooses a sub - band , the users on each sub - band are still a ppp and are independent across bands . as a result ,",
    "the maximum intensity of transmissions _ per sub - band _ is @xmath52 as defined in ( [ eq - transcap ] ) with sinr threshold @xmath65 and noise power @xmath67 .",
    "since the @xmath2 sub - bands are statistically identical , the maximum total intensity of transmissions , denoted @xmath68 , is the per sub - band intensity @xmath52 multiplied by @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ eq - transcap ] ) we have : @xmath69 the optimal number of sub - bands @xmath70 is that which maximizes total transmission density : @xmath71 it is useful to interpret this optimization in terms of bandwidth and area . dividing ( [ eq - tc_approx1 ] ) by @xmath0 and then inverting yields : @xmath72 which is the product of the constant @xmath73 , sub - band bandwidth @xmath8 , and the required interferer - free area .",
    "total density is maximized by minimizing this quantity , i.e. , by minimizing the _ bandwidth - area product _ of each transmission .",
    "it is easily checked that the interferer - free area is a strictly increasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , as the number of sub - bands @xmath2 is increased the bandwidth consumed by each transmission decreases while the area increases , leading to a non - trivial tradeoff .    rather than solving the maximization in ( [ eq - optn ] ) with respect to @xmath2 , it is more convenient to maximize with respect to the _ operating spectral efficiency _ , which is equal to the transmission rate divided by the bandwidth of each sub - band : @xmath74 it is important to note that the operating spectral efficiency @xmath75 is a design parameter even though the per - transmission rate @xmath1 and system bandwidth @xmath0 are fixed .",
    "should be limited to integer multiples of @xmath76 ; in this case @xmath70 is either the integer floor or ceiling of @xmath77 due to the nature of the objective function . however ,",
    "if a more general scenario is considered where the sub - band structure as well as the length of transmission is being designed ( e.g. , in a packetized system ) , these two parameters allow for operation at any desired @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , arbitrary @xmath78 are considered for the remainder of the paper . ]    with this substitution the transmission density can be written as a function of @xmath75 : @xmath79 noting that the constant @xmath80 is the received energy per information bit @xcite and defining the constant @xmath81 , this can be further simplified as : @xmath82 the optimal spectral efficiency @xmath83 is therefore the solution to the following optimization : @xmath84 note that the optimal @xmath83 depends only on the path loss exponent @xmath13 and @xmath25 , and thus any dependence on power and rate is completely captured by @xmath25 . by posing the problem in terms of spectral efficiency , any direct dependence on @xmath0",
    "is removed .",
    "furthermore , the problem is completely independent of the outage constraint @xmath53 .",
    "the problem in ( [ eq - master_b ] ) is only feasible for @xmath75 satisfying @xmath85 , which corresponds to the sinr threshold @xmath86 being no larger than the interference - free snr @xmath87 .",
