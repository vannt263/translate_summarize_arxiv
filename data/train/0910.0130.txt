    "two borel measures @xmath6 on @xmath5 are said to be _ equivalent _ if @xmath7 has a density with respect to @xmath8 and vice versa .",
    "they are said to _ disjoint _ or _ mutually singular _ if there exist disjoint borel subsets @xmath9 and @xmath10 such that @xmath7 is supported by @xmath9 and @xmath8 is supported by @xmath10 ( that is , @xmath11 ) .",
    "assume @xmath12 is a group acting on @xmath5 by borel transformations ; then a borel measure @xmath4 is said to be @xmath12-_quasi - invariant _ if @xmath4 is equivalent to its transform by any element @xmath13 .    in practice , especially for measures living on `` large '' spaces , verifying the property of equivalence , disjointness or quasi - invariance , and explicit computation of densities ( radon  nikodm derivatives ) for equivalent measures can be a nontrivial task .",
    "there exist nice general results for particular classes of measures : infinite product measures ( kakutani s theorem @xcite ) , gaussian measures on infinite - dimensional spaces ( feldman  hajek s theorem and related results , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii ) ) , poisson measures ( see @xcite ) .    assume that @xmath14 is a locally compact space , take as the `` large '' space @xmath5 the space @xmath15 of locally finite point configurations on @xmath14 , and assume that the measures under consideration are probability measures on @xmath16 ; they are also called _",
    "point processes _ on @xmath14 ( for fundamentals of point processes , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "poisson measures are just the simplest yet important example of point processes .",
    "the next by complexity example is the class of _ determinantal _ measures ( processes ) .",
    "determinantal measures are specified by their correlation kernels which are functions @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "note an analogy with covariation kernels of gaussian measures which are also functions in two variables .",
    "note also that , informally , poisson measures can be viewed as a degenerate case of determinantal measures corresponding to kernels @xmath17 concentrated on the diagonal @xmath19 .",
    "many concrete examples of determinantal measures are furnished by random matrix theory and other sources , see , e.g. , the surveys @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the interest to determinantal measures especially increased in the last years .",
    "however , to the best of my knowledge , the following problem was never discussed in the literature :    [ p1 ] _ assume we are given two determinantal measures , @xmath7 and @xmath8 on a common space @xmath15 . how to test their equivalence ( or , on the contrary , disjointness ) ?",
    "is it possible to decide this by inspection of the respective correlation kernels @xmath20 and @xmath21 ? _",
    "one could imagine that equivalence @xmath22 holds if the kernels are close to each other in an appropriate sense . however , there is a subtlety here , see subsection [ 1 - 6 ] below .",
    "let @xmath12 be a group of homeomorphisms @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath12 also acts , in a natural way , on the space @xmath15 and hence on the space of probability measures on @xmath15 .",
    "observe that the latter action preserves the determinantal property : if @xmath4 is a determinantal measure on @xmath15 with correlation kernel @xmath17 , then the transformed measure @xmath24 is determinantal , too , and @xmath25 serves as its correlation kernel .",
    "thus , the question of @xmath12-quasi - invariance of @xmath4 becomes a special instance of problem [ p1 ] :    [ p2 ] _ let @xmath4 and @xmath12 be as above . how to test whether @xmath4 is @xmath12-quasi - invariant ?",
    "is it possible to decide this by comparing the correlation kernels @xmath17 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 ?",
    "i think it would be interesting to develop general methods for solving problem [ p2 ] and more general problem [ p1 ] .",
    "they seem to be nontrivial even in the case when @xmath14 is a countably infinite set with discrete topology .      in the present paper we are dealing with a concrete model of determinantal measures , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath14 is assumed to be discrete and countable ; it is convenient to identify it with the lattice @xmath27 of half  integers .",
    "then the space @xmath28 is simply the space of all subsets of @xmath29 .",
    "we consider a two - parameter family of kernels on @xmath30 .",
    "following @xcite , we denote them as @xmath31 ; here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are some continuous parameters , and @xmath34 are the arguments , which range over @xmath29 .",
    "each kernel is real - valued and symmetric .",
    "moreover , it is a projection kernel meaning that it corresponds to a projection operator in the hilbert space @xmath35 . like many examples of kernels from random matrix theory ,",
    "our kernels can be written in the so - called integrable form @xcite , @xcite @xmath36 resembling christoffel ",
    "darboux kernels associated to orthogonal polynomials . in our situation @xmath37 and @xmath38 are certain functions on the lattice @xmath29 , which are expressed through euler s @xmath3-function . for this reason we call",
    "@xmath31 the _ gamma kernel_. in @xcite we conjectured that the gamma kernel might be a universal microscopic limit of the christoffel ",
    "darboux kernels for generic discrete orthogonal polynomials , in an appropriate asymptotic regime .",
    "the gamma kernel serves as the correlation kernel for a determinantal measure on @xmath39 , called the _ gamma kernel measure _ and denoted as @xmath40 . according to the general definition of determinantal measures ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , the measure @xmath40 is characterized by its correlation functions @xmath41 which in turn are equal to principal @xmath42 minors of the kernel : @xmath43_{i , j=1}^n.\\ ] ] here @xmath44 and @xmath45 is an arbitrary @xmath46-tuple @xmath45 of pairwise distinct points from @xmath29 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the gamma kernel measure arises from several models of representation  theoretic origin , through certain limit transitions .",
    "a more detailed information about @xmath31 and @xmath40 is given in section [ 1 ] below , see also @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we take as @xmath12 the group @xmath47 of permutations of the set @xmath29 fixing all but finitely many points .",
    "such permutations are said to be _",
    "finitary_. clearly , @xmath47 is a countable group .",
    "it is generated by the elementary transpositions @xmath48 of the lattice @xmath29 : here @xmath49 and @xmath48 transposes the points @xmath50 and @xmath51 of @xmath29 .",
    "each permutation @xmath52 induces , in a natural fashion , a transformation of the space @xmath39 , which in turn results in a transformation @xmath53 of probability measures on @xmath39 .",
    "the main result of the paper says that the gamma kernel measure is quasi - invariant with respect to the action of the group @xmath47 :    * main theorem . *",
    "_ for any @xmath54 , the measures @xmath40 and @xmath55 are equivalent",
    ". moreover , the radon  nikodm derivative @xmath56 can be explicitly computed_.    this result gives a solution to the first question of problem [ p2 ] in a concrete situation . as will be shown in another paper , the quasi - invariance property established in the theorem makes it possible to construct an equilibrium markov process on @xmath39 with determinantal dynamical correlation functions and equilibrium distribution @xmath40 .",
    "this application is one of the motivations of the present work .",
    "it seems plausible that @xmath40 is _ not _ quasi - invariant with respect to the transformations of @xmath39 generated by the translations of the lattice .",
    "note that the translation @xmath57 with @xmath58 amounts to the shift @xmath59 of the parameters ( see theorem [ 1.4 ] ) .",
    "one can ask , more generally , whether any two gamma kernel measures with distinct parameters are disjoint . should be viewed as an _ unordered _ pair of parameters , because the transposition @xmath60 does not affect the measure , see theorem [ 1.4 ] . ]",
    "the proof relies on the fact that for fixed @xmath61 , the measure @xmath40 can be approximated by simpler measures which are @xmath47quasiinvariant and whose radon  nikodm derivatives ( with respect to the action of the group @xmath47 ) are readily computable .",
    "the approximating measures depend on an additional parameter @xmath62 and are denoted as @xmath63 .",
    "these are purely atomic probability measures supported by a single @xmath47orbit .",
    "they come from certain probability distributions on young diagrams , and are called the _ z  measures _ ( kerov  olshanski  vershik @xcite , borodin ",
    "olshanski @xcite ) .",
    "as @xmath64 goes to @xmath65 , the measures @xmath63 weakly converge to @xmath40 : this is simply the initial definition of @xmath40 given in @xcite .",
    "what we actually need to prove is that the convergence of the measures holds not only in the weak topology ( that is , on bounded continuous test functions ) but also in a much stronger sense : namely , @xmath66 for certain test functions @xmath67 which , like the radon  nikodm derivatives , may be unbounded and not everywhere defined . here and in the sequel the angular brackets denote the pairing between functions and measures .    to explain this point more precisely we need some preparation .",
    "first of all , it is convenient to transform all the measures in question by means of an involutive homeomorphism of the compact space @xmath68 .",
    "this homeomorphism , denoted as `` @xmath69 '' , assigns to a configuration @xmath70 its symmetric difference with the set @xmath71 .",
    "an equivalent description is the following .",
    "regard @xmath72 as a configuration of charged particles occupying some of the sites of the lattice @xmath29 , while the holes ( that is , the unoccupied sites of @xmath29 ) are interpreted as anti ",
    "particles with opposite charge .",
    "now , the new configuration @xmath73 is formed by the particles sitting to the right of 0 and the anti  particles to the left of 0 .",
    "we call `` @xmath69 '' the _ particle / hole involution _ on @xmath74 .    for instance , if @xmath75 then @xmath76 , the empty configuration .",
    "the configuration @xmath75 plays a distinguished role because the @xmath77orbit of this configuration is the support of the pre ",
    "limit measures @xmath63 .",
    "the map `` @xmath69 '' transforms this distinguished orbit into the set of all finite _ balanced _ configurations , that is , finite configurations with equally many points to the right and to the left of @xmath78 .",
    "note that the transform by `` @xmath69 '' leaves intact the action of all the elementary transpositions @xmath48 with @xmath79 , only the action of @xmath80 is perturbed .",
    "note also that if @xmath81 is a determinantal measure on @xmath39 then so is its push  forward @xmath82 , and there is a simple relation between the correlation kernels of @xmath81 and @xmath4 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) .",
    "if the kernel of @xmath81 is symmetric then that of @xmath4 has a different kind of symmetry : it is symmetric with respect to an indefinite inner product ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.3 and remark 2.4 ) ) , which reflects the presence of two kinds of particles .    instead of the measures @xmath63 and @xmath40 we will deal with their transforms by `` @xmath69 '' , denoted as @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "clearly , the transform does not affect the formulation of the theorem , only the initial action of the group @xmath47 on @xmath39 has to be conjugated by the involution : an element @xmath52 now acts as the transformation @xmath85    an advantage of the transformed measures as compared to the initial ones is that the pre  limit measures @xmath86 live on finite configurations . in a weaker form",
    ", this property is inherited by the limit measures .",
    "namely , let us say that a configuration @xmath70 is _ sparse _ if @xmath87 denote the set of all sparse configurations as @xmath88 . there is a natural embedding @xmath89 assigning to a sparse configuration @xmath72 its characteristic function multiplied by the function @xmath90 , and we equip @xmath88 with the `` @xmath91topology '' , that is , the one induced by the norm of the banach space @xmath92 . the @xmath91topology is finer than the topology induced from the ambient space @xmath39 .",
    "now we are in a position to describe the scheme of proof .",
    "[ c1 ] _ the limit measures @xmath93 are concentrated on the set of sparse configurations .",
    "_    the claim makes sense because the set @xmath88 is a borel subset in @xmath39 .    given a function @xmath94 on the lattice @xmath29 such that @xmath95",
    ", we define a function @xmath96 on the set of sparse configurations by the formula @xmath97 ( the product is convergent ) .",
    "such functions @xmath98 will be called _ multiplicative functionals _ on configurations .",
    "any multiplicative functional @xmath98 is continuous in the @xmath91topology .",
    "given a permutation @xmath52 and a measure @xmath4 on @xmath39 , we denote by @xmath99 the push  forward of @xmath4 under the transformation @xmath100 , see .",
    "let @xmath61 be fixed and @xmath64 range over @xmath101 . for any @xmath52 ,",
    "let @xmath102 be the radon  nikodm derivative of the measure @xmath103 with respect to the measure @xmath86 .",
    "that is , @xmath104 here @xmath72 belongs to the countable set of finite balanced configurations .    [ c2 ]    _ fix an arbitrary @xmath52 .",
    "_    \\(i ) the function @xmath102 has a unique extension to a continuous function on @xmath88 .",
    "\\(ii ) as @xmath105 , the extended functions obtained in this way converge pointwise to a continuous function @xmath106 on @xmath88 .",
    "\\(iii ) the limit function @xmath106 can be written as a finite linear combination of multiplicative functionals of the form .    here",
    "continuity is assumed with respect to the @xmath91topology .",
    "actually , a somewhat stronger claim holds , see proposition [ 3.1 ] and the subsequent discussion .",
    "claim [ c2 ] suggests that the limit function @xmath106 might serve as the radon  nikodm derivative for the limit measure , that is , @xmath107    this relation is indeed true .",
    "we reduce it to the following claim .",
    "[ c3 ] _ let @xmath94 be an arbitrary function on @xmath29 such that @xmath95 .",
    "then the multiplicative functional @xmath98 given by is absolutely integrable with respect to both the pre  limit and limit measures , and we have _",
    "@xmath108    this claim is stronger than the assertion about the weak convergence of measures @xmath109 which was known previously .",
    "indeed , weak convergence of measures on @xmath39 means convergence on continuous test functions , while multiplicative functionals are , generally speaking , unbounded functions on @xmath88 and thus can not be extended to continuous functions on the compact space @xmath39 .",
    "to prove claim [ c3 ] we use the well  known fact that the expectation of a multiplicative functional with respect to a determinantal measure can be expressed as a fredholm determinant involving the correlation kernel .",
    "this makes it possible to reformulate the claim in terms of the correlation operators @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( these are operators in the hilbert space @xmath35 whose matrices are the correlation kernels of the measures @xmath86 and @xmath93 , respectively ) .",
    "the reformulation is given in claim [ c4 ] below .",
    "represent the hilbert space @xmath112 as the direct sum of two subspaces @xmath113 according to the splitting @xmath114 ( positive and negative half  integers ) .",

    "let @xmath117 denote the set ( actually , algebra ) of bounded operators in @xmath115 whose two diagonal blocks are trace class operators and two off  diagonal blocks are hilbert  schmidt operators .",

    "_    note that the operator @xmath123 _ is not _ in @xmath117 , because the series @xmath124 taken over all @xmath125 is divergent .",
    "this is the source of difficulties .",
    "for instance , the assertion that @xmath121 belongs to @xmath117 is not a formal consequence of the boundedness of @xmath111 .",
    "claim [ c4 ] is the key technical result of the paper .",
    "the proof relies on explicit expressions for the correlation kernels in terms of contour integrals and requires a considerable computational work .",
    "i do not know whether the operators @xmath122 approach @xmath121 simply in the trace class norm .",
    "the point is that the diagonal blocks are hermitian nonnegative operators while the operators themselves are not . for nonnegative operators",
    ", one can use the fact that the convergence in the trace class norm is equivalent to the weak convergence together with the convergence of traces . for non  hermitian operators , dealing with the trace class norm is difficult , while the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm turns out to be much easier to handle .",
    "fortunately , for the off  diagonal blocks , the convergence in the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm already suffices .",
    "section [ 1 ] contains the basic notation and definitions related to the measures under consideration and their correlation kernels .",
    "section [ 2 ] starts with basic facts related to multiplicative functionals and their connection to fredholm determinants ; then the proof of claim [ c1 ] follows ; it is readily derived from the explicit expression for the first correlation function of the measure @xmath40 .",
    "section [ 3 ] is devoted to the proof of claim [ c2 ] . in section",
    "[ 4 ] , we formulate the main result ( theorem [ 4.1 ] )",
    ". then we reduce to it to theorem [ 4.2 ] and next to theorem [ 4.3 ] ; they correspond to claims [ c3 ] and [ c4 ] , respectively .",
    "the main technical work is done in sections [ 5 ] and [ 6 ] , where we prove theorem [ 4.3 ] ( or claim [ c4 ] ) separately for diagonal and off  diagonal blocks .",
    "i am very much indebted to alexei borodin for a number of important suggestions which helped me in dealing with asymptotics of contour integral representations .",
    "i am also grateful to leonid petrov and sergey pirogov for valuable remarks .",
    "a _ partition _ is an infinite sequence @xmath126 of nonnegative integers @xmath127 such that @xmath128 and only finitely many @xmath127 s are nonzero .",
    "we set @xmath129 .",

    "the unoccupied nodes are called _",
    "let @xmath39 denote the space of all particle configurations on @xmath29 .",
    "the space @xmath39 can be identified with the infinite product space @xmath133 and we equip it with the product topology . in this topology , @xmath39 is a totally disconnected compact space .",
    "recall ( see subsection [ 0 - 4 ] ) that the _ particle / hole involution _ on @xmath74 is the involutive map @xmath134 keeping intact particles and holes on @xmath135 and changing particles by holes and vice versa on @xmath136 .",

    "infinite point configuration @xmath139 note that among @xmath127 s some terms may repeat while the numbers @xmath140 are all pairwise distinct . clearly , the correspondence @xmath141 is one  to  one .",
    "the configuration @xmath142 is sometimes called the _ maya diagram _ of @xmath143 , see miwa  jimbo  date @xcite .",
    "for instance , the maya diagram of the zero partition @xmath144 is @xmath74 .",
    "any maya diagram can be obtained from this one by finitely many elementary moves consisting in shifting one particle to the neighboring position on the right provided that it is unoccupied .",
    "a _ finite _ configuration @xmath145 is called _ balanced _ if @xmath146 .",
    "an important fact is that `` @xmath69 '' establishes a bijective correspondence between the maya diagrams @xmath142 and the balanced configurations .",
    "we set @xmath147    an alternative interpretation of the balanced configuration @xmath148 is as follows : @xmath149 with @xmath150 ( recall that @xmath151 ) , where the positive half  integers @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the _ modified frobenius coordinates _ ( vershik  kerov @xcite ) of the young diagram @xmath143 .",
    "they differ from the conventional frobenius coordinates @xcite by the additional summand @xmath154 .",
    "a slight divergence with the conventional notation is that we arrange the coordinates in the ascending order .    a direct explanation : @xmath155 is the number of diagonal boxes in @xmath143 and @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the transposed diagram .",
    "thus , we have defined two embeddings of the countable set @xmath130 into the space @xmath39 , namely , @xmath141 and @xmath158 .",
    "these two embeddings are related to each other by the particle / hole involution on @xmath74 .",

    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are assumed to be fixed . if the third parameter @xmath64 approaches 0 , then the z ",
    "measures @xmath174 converge to the dirac measure at the zero partition : this is caused by the factor @xmath178 .",
    "a much more interesting picture arises as @xmath64 approaches 1 .",
    "then the factor @xmath179 forces each of the weights @xmath180 to tend to 0 ( note that @xmath181 ) .",

    "then we are left with the first integral together with the prefactor @xmath610 .",
    "let us make the same change of a variable as above : @xmath631 .",
    "then the integral reduces to @xmath632 the quantity @xmath633 is bounded uniformly on @xmath64 and hence may be ignored .",
    "the factor @xmath634 is inessential , too .",
    "further , using the same argument as on step 1 , we reduce our expression to the real integral @xmath635 where the upper limit arises due to the fact that @xmath636 .",
    "recall that @xmath637 .",
    "if @xmath638 then the integral is uniformly convergent , so that the whole expression grows as @xmath639 .",
    "if @xmath580 then the integral grows as @xmath640 , and so is the growth of the whole expression .",
    "if @xmath641 then the integral grows as @xmath642 and the whole expression remains bounded .",
    "in all these cases the small prefactor @xmath643 in dominates and makes the result asymptotically negligible .    [ 5.2 ] the matrix @xmath644_{m , n=0,1,2,\\dots}\\ ] ] is of trace class .",
    "we have to prove that @xmath645    since the @xmath502 blocks of @xmath111 and @xmath195 are the same , we may use formula . on the diagonal @xmath646 ,",
    "the ratio in formed by the @xmath3factors equals 1 , so that we may omit them .",
    "therefore , @xmath647 where the contours are the same as in .",
    "we have @xmath648    introduce the factor @xmath649 inside the integral and sum over @xmath650 .",
    "observe that @xmath651 thus , we have to prove that @xmath652    without the factor @xmath653 , this integral coincides with the integral with @xmath654 , whose convergence has already been verified ( see step 1 in the proof of proposition [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "let us show that the extra factor @xmath653 does not add very much .",
    "indeed , it grows only as both @xmath571 and @xmath572 go to infinity , so that we may assume that both @xmath571 and @xmath572 are far from the origin .",
    "if @xmath549 is a point on one of the contours , far from the origin , then writing @xmath655 we have @xmath656 large and @xmath657 small",
    ". then @xmath658 and consequently @xmath659 with @xmath660 as @xmath661 .",
    "this allows one to estimate the growth of the logarithm in @xmath653 . omitting unessential details",
    "we get that it behaves roughly as @xmath662 where @xmath312 can be chosen arbitrarily small .    using this bound and examining the argument of step 1 in proposition [ 5.1 ] we see that the same arguments work equally well with the extra factor @xmath653 .    in the sequel we use the notation @xmath663    [ 5.3 ] fix an arbitrary @xmath664 .",
    "if @xmath665 is large enough and @xmath558 then for all sufficiently small @xmath666 the following estimate holds @xmath667    consider the transform @xmath668 .",
    "its inverse has the form @xmath669 and sends the interior part of the circle @xmath670 to the exterior part @xmath671 of a circle @xmath672 .",
    "thus , we have to check that @xmath673 .",
    "the circle @xmath672 is symmetric relative the real axis and intersects it at the points @xmath674 corresponding to @xmath675 .",
    "let us prove that both @xmath676 and @xmath677 are on the left of @xmath678 , the leftmost point of the contour @xmath679 .",
    "we have @xmath680 and @xmath681    since @xmath682 , @xmath676 lies on the left of 0 . as for @xmath677",
    ", it lies on the left of @xmath683 because @xmath558 by the assumption .",
    "this shows that the interior part of the contour , @xmath679 lies in @xmath671 .",
    "the same also holds for the exterior part , @xmath684 , because @xmath665 can be made arbitrarily large .",
    "indeed , as seen from the above expressions for the points @xmath676 and @xmath677 , they do not run to infinity as @xmath105 , so that if @xmath665 is chosen large enough , the circle of radius @xmath665 will enclose the circle @xmath672 for any @xmath64 .",
    "[ 5.4 ] @xmath685    we will argue as in the proof of proposition [ 5.1 ] , steps 24 .",
    "the role of step 1 in that proof will be played by proposition [ 5.2 ] .",
    "first of all , observe that on the diagonal @xmath19 , the expression formed by the @xmath3factors in front of the integrals in and equals 1 .",
    "consequently , we may ignore these factors .",
    "let @xmath686 denote the integrand in the integral corresponding to @xmath646 .",
    "likewise , let @xmath687 denote the integrand in the integral with @xmath646 .",
    "we have to prove that @xmath688    we already dispose of all the necessary information to conclude that holds provided that we truncate the both contours in the left  hand side to @xmath679 . indeed ,",
    "the ratio @xmath689 is the particular case of corresponding to @xmath646 .",
    "the argument of step 3 in proposition [ 5.1 ] shows that this expression goes to 1 pointwise .",
    "moreover , its modulus is bounded uniformly on both @xmath64 and @xmath690 : to see this observe that @xmath691 and recall that @xmath692 , @xmath693 .",
    "together with the result of proposition [ 5.2 ] this implies the claim .",
    "now we have to check that the contribution of the remaining parts of the contours to the left ",
    "hand side of is asymptotically negligible .",
    "this can be done by slightly modifying the argument of step 4 in proposition [ 5.1 ] .",
    "indeed , the integrand @xmath694 can be written in the form @xmath695 compare our task with the one we had on step 4 in proposition [ 5.1 ] ( where we set @xmath654 ) .",
    "the only difference is that now we have in the integral the extra factor equal to @xmath696 by lemma [ 5.3 ] , the quantity is majorated by @xmath697 which grows as @xmath698 .",
    "such an extra factor does not affect the estimates on step 4 of proposition [ 5.1 ] .",
    "here we prove the claims of theorem [ 4.3 ] for the off  diagonal blocks . as in section [ 5 ] , we apply the symmetry relations of proposition [ 1.9 ] to reduce the case of the @xmath699 block to that of the @xmath700 block , and due to the relations of subsection [ 1 - 5 ] , we may freely switch from @xmath244 to @xmath191 .    however , to compute the hilbert ",
    "schmidt norm of the @xmath700 block we can not use anymore the basic contour integral representation as we did in section [ 5 ] , because this would lead to divergent series in the integrand .",
    "the reason of this is that the variable @xmath627 , which previously ranged over @xmath132 , will now range over @xmath74 .",
    "it turns out that we still may employ essentially the same estimates and arguments as in section [ 5 ] but beforehand we have to change the integral representation .",
    "return to the initial version of the contours @xmath508 and @xmath509 in , when they were circles slightly greater than the unit circle , and make the change of a variable @xmath701 .",
    "then the former condition @xmath514 will turn into the requirement that the second contour must lie inside the first contour .",
    "further , we deform the contours so that they take the form @xmath702 and @xmath703 , respectively , where @xmath704 and @xmath705 : these inequalities just guarantee that the contour @xmath703 lies inside @xmath702 .",
    "according to proposition [ 5.1 ] , for any fixed @xmath198 , there exists a limit @xmath707 for which we dispose of the double contour integral representation .",
    "however , now we will need a different integral representation , which is consistent with :      the @xmath3factors in and are the same , so that it suffices to prove that the integral in together with the prefactor @xmath643 converges to the integral in .",
    "we will follow the scheme of the proof of proposition [ 5.1 ] .    _ step _ 1 .",
    "let us check that that the integral is absolutely convergent .",
    "arguing as on step 1 of proposition [ 5.1 ] we reduce this claim to finiteness of the real integral @xmath710 where @xmath637 , @xmath711 , and @xmath573 is a positive constant .",
    "by symmetry we may assume @xmath712 .",
    "making the change of variables @xmath713 , @xmath714 , where @xmath715 , @xmath716 , we get the integral @xmath717 consider the interior integral in the second line : for large @xmath549 , the integrand decays as @xmath718 , which is integrable near infinity , while for @xmath549 near 0 , the integrand behaves as @xmath719 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath720 then the integral over @xmath549 converges uniformly on @xmath427 ; if @xmath580 then it grows as @xmath721 for large @xmath427 ; and if @xmath722 then it grows as @xmath723 .",
    "consequently , the double integral can be estimated by one of the three convergent integrals @xmath724    _ step _ 2 .",
    "relying on the result of step 1 , we can verify the required convergence of the integrals provided that we restrict the integration in to interior parts of the contours .",
    "this is done exactly as on step 3 of proposition [ 5.1 ] .",
    "a minor simplification is that under the change of a variable , the quantity @xmath725 is transformed simpler than @xmath515 .",
    "_ step _ 3 .",
    "finally , we have to prove that the contributions from the remaining parts of the contours is asymptotically negligible due to the prefactor @xmath610 . here",
    "we argue exactly as on step 4 of proposition [ 5.1 ] , with the only exception : in the case when @xmath518 ranges over the interior part of the contour , @xmath726 , while @xmath519 ranges over the exterior part , @xmath727 , we can not automatically discard the denominator @xmath725 .",
    "the reason is that in this special case , the two parts of the contours come close at the distance of order @xmath666 , which happens near the point @xmath728 .",
    "this difficulty can be resolved in the following way . dissect @xmath726 into two parts by a vertical line @xmath729 so that the points on the left be separated from @xmath728 while the points on the right be separated from @xmath730 .",
    "now we have two cases :      when @xmath518 ranges over the right part , the argument is different : observe that the modulus of the whole integrand in , except the denominator @xmath725 , is bounded uniformly on @xmath64 , while the quantity @xmath731 is integrable , so that the prefactor @xmath610 makes the contribution negligible . checking",
    "the integrability of @xmath731 is easy : indeed , here it is even unessential that @xmath727 does not contain a small arc around the point @xmath728 .",
    "what is important is that the singularity @xmath731 arising near the point @xmath728 is of the same kind as the singularity @xmath732 in the real @xmath733plane near the origin .",
    "although formulas and are valid for any @xmath198 , we will deal exclusively with @xmath734 and @xmath735 .",
    "below we set @xmath736 and use the notation @xmath737 here the factor @xmath738 comes from the factor @xmath739 in .          to get the squared matrix entry we multiply out two copies of the double integral representation , where in the second copy we swap @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this operation does not change the kernel , as it follows from a series expansion for the kernel ( see ( * ? ? ? * ( 3.3 ) ) ) and the fact that the functions entering this expansion depend symmetrically on @xmath32 and @xmath33 . on the other hand , after this operation the @xmath3factors in front of the integral will cancel out ( this trick is borrowed from @xcite and @xcite , see , e.g. , the proof of proposition 2.3 in @xcite ) . the resulting expression for the sum can be written in the form @xmath742 where @xmath743 , \\\\ \\{u_2\\}=\\{u'_2\\}=[+\\infty - i\\rho_2,0-,+\\infty+i\\rho_2]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and @xmath744 ( in the second line @xmath32 and @xmath33 are interchanged ) .",
    "we have @xmath746",
    "the same argument as in the proof of proposition [ 5.2 ] shows that for the latter sum there exists the upper bound of the form @xmath747 where @xmath312 can be chosen as small as is needed .",
    "substituting this estimate into the 4fold integral leads to its splitting into the product of two double integrals , one of which is @xmath748 and the other has the similar form , with @xmath32 and @xmath33 interchanged .",
    "therefore , it suffices to prove the finiteness of the integral .",
    "arguing as on step 1 of proposition [ 5.1 ] we reduce this integral to the real integral @xmath749 this integral only slightly differs from the integral examined on step 1 of proposition [ 6.1 ] , and the same argument as in proposition [ 6.1 ] shows that is finite provided that @xmath750 is chosen small enough .",
    "we know that the convergence takes place in the weak operator topology , that is , for the matrix entries ( this follows from proposition [ 5.1 ] ) .",
    "consequently , it suffices to prove the convergence of the squared hilbert ",
    "schmidt norms : @xmath753 ( recall that our matrices are real ) .      write the left  hand side in the form similar to . namely , let @xmath754 denote the integrand in , where we substitute @xmath755 and @xmath756 : @xmath757 and let @xmath758 be the similar quantity with @xmath32 and @xmath33 interchanged : @xmath759 as above , swapping @xmath32 and @xmath33 kills the @xmath3factors . in this notation ,",
    "the series in question takes the form @xmath760 where @xmath761 and @xmath704 , @xmath762 , @xmath763 , as before .",
    "first , we truncate all the contours in keeping only their interior parts @xmath764 , and then make the change of variables according to the rule , as we did before .",
    "the prefactor @xmath765 disappears , we compare the resulting integrand with that in , and check that their ratio has uniformly bounded modulus and converges pointwise to 1 .",
    "this is done exactly as in step 3 of the proof of proposition [ 5.4 ] . by virtue of proposition",
    "[ 6.3 ] , we get the desired convergence provided that the both contours in are truncated .    next , we check that the contribution from the remaining parts of the contours in is asymptotically negligible due to the prefactor @xmath765 . again",
    ", the proof goes as in the situation of proposition [ 5.4 ] .",
    "we replace the integrand by its modulus , interchange summation and integration , and evaluate the double sum over @xmath690 and @xmath46 using lemma [ 5.3 ] .",
    "this produces a factor growing like @xmath766 , which we add to our small prefactor @xmath765 . due to",
    "this bound , the 4fold integral reduces to the product of two double integrals , @xmath767 , and for at least one of them the corresponding superscript has to be `` @xmath768 '' .",

    "( b ) the growth is suppressed by the small factor @xmath643 , even if one adds the extra growing factor @xmath766 .",
