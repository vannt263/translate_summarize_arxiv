    "gluon saturation has been the focal point of important and interesting particle - physics investigations for many years .",
    "its observation would allow to access a new regime of quantum chromodynamics where high - density gluons form a coherent state . in regions of large parton densities",
    "the physics is governed by a single hard scale , @xmath1 , which increases with energy and thus allows the use of small - coupling techniques @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "gluon recombination starts to compete with the exponentially increasing gluon splitting and the gluon distribution function is expected to saturate . at the hera , some evidence for gluon saturation in the proton was found in deep inelastic @xmath2 collisions at high energy and low values of bjorken-@xmath3 , but the results are still open to interpretation @xcite .",
    "the existence of geometric scaling as predicted by the color glass theory as an approach to saturation physics was indeed confirmed , constituting the most important evidence for saturation so far @xcite .",
    "since the saturation scale is enhanced by a factor @xmath4 in heavy ions , as compared to protons , it is natural to investigate saturation in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , as has been done by many authors @xcite . here",
    "theoretical qcd - based approaches have , so far , usually concentrated on charged - hadron production and , in the central rapidity region , a reasonable understanding was achieved in the color glass condensate framework @xcite through inclusive gluon production @xcite .    in @xmath5 collisions the nuclear wave function is being probed at small @xmath3 in the forward direction and it should show saturation below a characteristic value of @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the effect of gluon condensation and quantum evolution should be measurable , as was attempted by the brahms collaboration at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) in @xmath6 + au collisions @xcite .",
    "measurements of the nuclear modification factor showed the cronin enhancement at midrapidity , but the modification factor is suppressed at forward rapidities .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the color - glass predictions @xcite .",
    "experimental heavy - ion investigations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) concentrate on the midrapidity region since alice @xcite covers rapidities up to @xmath7 = 2 .",
    "it provides measurements of lower @xmath3 values than before  down to @xmath8at an energy scale that is high enough to provide crucial tests of gluon saturation .    in the present phenomenological investigation we use the transverse momentum spectra and rapidity distributions of net baryons ( @xmath9 ) in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite as a testing ground for saturation physics",
    "a primary account of our approach was given in ref .",
    "it made use of the color - glass framework @xcite .",
    "related approaches of other authors to the net - baryon problem with respect to gluon saturation are refs .",
    "we compare with data that were obtained by scaling distributions of identified net protons at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and rhic energies , and extrapolate to lhc energies .",
    "this problem was treated with different approaches based on qcd without saturation @xcite .    in @xmath10 collisions , two distinct and symmetric peaks with respect to rapidity",
    "@xmath11 occur at sps energies @xcite and beyond .",
    "the rapidity separation between the peaks increases with energy and decreases with increasing mass number , @xmath12 , reflecting larger baryon stopping for heavier nuclei , as was investigated phenomenologically in the nonequilibrium - statistical relativistic diffusion model @xcite . in this work",
    "we show how the evolution of the peaks can be linked to saturation physics .    the net - baryon number is essentially transported by valence quarks that probe the saturation regime in the target by multiple scatterings . during the collision , the fast valence quarks in one nucleus scatter in the other nucleus by exchanging soft gluons , leading to their redistribution in rapidity space . we take advantage of the fact that the valence quark parton distribution is well known at large @xmath3 , which corresponds to the forward and backward rapidity region , to access the gluon distribution at small @xmath3 in the target nucleus .",

    "the spectra constrain our model that contains only two parameters , @xmath38 , and the overall normalization c. this investigation also provides some hints regarding the transition from a coherent gluonic state ( the color glass condensate ) at low transverse momenta to incoherent partonic ( jetlike ) interactions at high transverse momenta .",
    "the valence quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the nucleus is taken to be equal to the valence quark pdf in a nucleon times the number of participants in the nucleus . here , we focus on the forward rapidity region and interpolate to midrapidity where small-@xmath3 quarks are dominant , by matching the leading - order distributions @xcite and the regge trajectory , @xmath113 , at @xmath114 @xcite .",

    "we refer to this result as the f - model ( for fragmentation model ) . in the nf - model ( no - fragmentation ) , we assume that , on average , the energy of the parton is equal to that of the produced baryon , namely @xmath104 .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that hadronization at low @xmath14 is poorly known and it was proven @xcite that it is dominated by recombination of partons instead of fragmentation , which will imply @xmath120 .",
    "hence , there should be a competition between the two phenomena , fragmentation and recombination .",
    "namely , due to the high parton density characteristic of high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the parton showers described in the fragmentation picture can overlap .",

    "the increasing discrepancy between the data and both models toward midrapidity is expected because of the reduction of the window for saturation effects with decreasing energy and rapidity .",
    "in addition , the quark - nucleus cross section is valid in the eikonal approximation : it is meant to be applicable at forward rapidity where the valence - quark longitudinal momentum fraction is @xmath130 .",
    "another source of uncertainty can result from an additional rescattering of the valence quark in the quark - gluon plasma leading to an enhancement of the mean @xmath14 broadening , essentially at midrapidity , where medium effects are expected to be important , @xmath131 resulting in a harder spectrum at midrapidity and better agreement with the data .",
    "the integrated net - proton rapidity distributions , scaled by a factor of 2.05 @xcite to obtain the net - baryon distributions , are shown in fig .",

    "hence , the mean rapidity loss that accompanies the energy loss in the course of the slowing down of baryons provides a measure for @xmath16 and thus a test for saturation physics . the gray band in fig . [ fig10 ]",
    "reflects the uncertainty of how to place the remaining baryons that are missing in our model .",
    "we refer to them by @xmath162 , with @xmath163 .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to the case where the missing baryons sit at the mean rapidity , roughly about the peak rapidity .",
    "then the corrected mean rapidity loss is equivalent to the theoretical one , @xmath164 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to the case where they sit at the beam rapidity , @xmath165 .",
    "the full line is the mean value of the two calculations and it is in reasonable agreement with the upper limit of the data given by brahms .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "the mean rapidity loss @xmath166 as obtained from our theoretical results is plotted as a function of beam rapidity @xmath160 ( solid curve ) .",
    "the star at @xmath167 = 8.68 is our prediction for central pb + pb at lhc energies of @xmath0 = 5.52 tev with @xmath39 and @xmath141 gev@xmath122 .",
    "analysis results from ags au + au data ( e917 , e802/e866 , triangles ) @xcite , sps pb + pb data ( na49 , square ) @xcite , and rhic au + au data ( brahms , dots , with triangles as lower and upper limits ) @xcite are compared with the calculations.,width=325 ]",
    "in summary , we present a saturation model for net - baryon distributions that successfully describes net - proton rapidity distributions and their energy and mass dependence . the remarkable feature of geometric scaling predicted by the cgc is reflected in the net - baryon rapidity distribution , providing a direct test of saturation physics .",
    "in particular , we show that the peak position in net - proton or net - baryon rapidity distributions of centrally colliding heavy ions at ultrarelativistic energies obeys a scaling law involving the mass number and the beam energy .",
    "we explore the validity of that scaling law in comparisons with experimental rapidity distributions from central pb + pb and au + au collisions at sps and rhic energies and find good agreement with the na49 and brahms data on net - proton distributions that were scaled to net baryons .",
    "we simultaneously investigate net - proton transverse momentum spectra at rhic energies , as measured by the brahms collaboration , to find reasonable agreement of our model results with the data away from midrapidity .",
    "there is an increasing discrepancy toward midrapidity , which is expected because the window for saturation effects is reduced with decreasing energy and rapidity .",
    "the parameters saturation - scale exponent @xmath16 and momentum scale @xmath168 are determined from the transverse momentum spectra for au + au at 200 gev and then kept fixed at all energies ( sps , rhic , and lhc ) in the calculations for the @xmath14 spectrum at 62.4 gev , and in all calculations of rapidity distributions .",
    "the third parameter is the overall normalization constant c , which we adjust to the data .",
    "model calculations for the rapidity distribution in central pb + pb collisions at lhc energies of 5.52 tev are obtained ; we previously discussed the dependence of the position of the fragmentation peak on the gluon saturation - scale exponent @xmath16 in ref .",
    "@xcite and do not repeat it here .",
    "our analytical scaling law yields an excellent description of the mass dependence of the net - baryon distribution at sps energies in a comparison of s + s and pb + pb results .",
    "the centrality dependence of the pb + pb rapidity distribution at 17.3 gev is well reproduced , whereas discrepancies remain for au + au at rhic energies .",
    "the theoretical result for the mean rapidity loss in @xmath155 = 200 gev au + au is larger than the brahms result as derived from their data , but consistent with the experimental upper limit .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of a detailed analysis at lhc energies , where it may then be possible to determine the value of the saturation - scale exponent @xmath16 more accurately @xcite and establish the attainment of gluon saturation .    to achieve this , forward measurements of identified hadrons  and in particular , baryons",
    " for central heavy - ion collisions will be desirable .",
    "the atlas and compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detectors for @xmath169 collisions are being extended to the forward region already ; totem is a dedicated forward detector",
    ". it will be useful to exploit these capabilities for central pb + pb physics as well .",
