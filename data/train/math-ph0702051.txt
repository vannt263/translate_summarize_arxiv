    ", we present a rigorous pertubation theory in the coupling constant and the energy for the lyapunov exponent and the density of states .",
    "this leads to a new and rich scaling diagram describing these two self - averaging quantities at a band edge .",

    "thouless @xcite found a perturbative formula for the lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length ) at an energy @xmath4 in the band spectrum of @xmath1 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is one of the identically distributed and centered entries of @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes the expectation value . a rigorous proof was provided by pastur and figotin using the prfer phases , also called the dyson - schmidt variables @xcite .",
    "this amounts to justifying the so - called random phase approximation , stating that the prfer phases are distributed according to the lebesgue measure on the unit circle .",
    "a further generalization was given in @xcite .",

    "the control on the error terms in breaks down at those energies , as does the random phase approximation .",
    "the latter also happens at the band center , namely for @xmath10 ; this leads to anomalies in the perturbative formula first found by kappus and wegner @xcite , and consecutively analyzed by several authors @xcite . a perturbative formula as for the band center with a control on the error terms was proven only recently @xcite .",
    "this paper considers the band edges and shows how the @xmath11 is modified , leading to the new scaling diagram near a band edge .",
    "parts of this diagram were already given by derrida and gardner @xcite .",
    "these authors actually found the correct scaling in the parabolic regime of theorem  [ theo - scaling ] below , but the wrong prefactor ( _ cf .",
    "_ the comment at the end of section  [ sec - bandedge ] )",
    ". moreover , they could not give a better justification of their scaling ansatz than that it leads to a differential equation they could solve . our more conceptual approach shows why the scaling is natural in the situation considered in @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a far richer scaling behavior near a band edge and also allows to rigorously control the higher order corrections .",
    "moreover , if one wants to give a perturbative proof of uniform positivity of the lyapunov exponent in an energy interval around a band edge , all of the scaling behaviors considered below are needed .",
    "let us now describe the main result in more detail .",
    "we consider a one - parameter family of random jacobi matrices @xmath12 given as the sum of an @xmath13-periodic background operator @xmath14 and a random perturbation @xmath15 which is linear in the ( small ) coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , for every fixed configuration @xmath17 , the operator @xmath18 acts on @xmath19 as @xmath20 where the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constructed as described in the following : let @xmath23 be given real constants with @xmath24 for @xmath25 ; set @xmath26^{2l}$ ] so that each @xmath27 is of the form @xmath28 ; then @xmath29 is the configuration space and to each @xmath30 there are associated sequences @xmath31 which for @xmath16 sufficiently small satisfy @xmath21 ; these sequences define @xmath18 by .",
    "in order to make @xmath12 into a family of random operators , we equip @xmath32 with a probability measure @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a probability measure on @xmath35 .",
    "expectation values w.r.t . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath34 will be denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath38 .    for every fixed energy @xmath39 and coupling parameter @xmath16 ,",
    "there are two self - averaging quantities of interest , namely the integrated density of states ( ids ) @xmath40 and the lyapunov exponent ( or inverse localization length ) @xmath41 .",
    "the definitions will be recalled in section  [ sec - dynamics ] below .",
    "the periodic operator @xmath14 has a band structure and we are interested in the scaling of the ids and lyapunov exponent at one of its band edges @xmath42 ( band touching excluded ) . in order to state the precise result , we need to introduce two quantities .",
    "let @xmath43 be the random transfer matrix at energy @xmath44 over a unit cell of length @xmath13 ( see section  [ sec - normal ] for the explicit formula ) . then set @xmath45    [ theo - scaling ] let @xmath42 be a band edge ( band touching excluded ) of the periodic background operator @xmath14 of a family of random jacobi matrices @xmath12 .",
    "the perturbation is supposed to be non - trivial in the sense that @xmath46 does not vanish @xmath34-almost surely .",
    "then the scaling near the band edge is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend on @xmath50 and @xmath51 as described in the following and resumed in figure  1 .",
    "\\(i ) ( elliptic regime ) let @xmath52 and let the sign of @xmath53 be such that @xmath54 is inside the band of @xmath55 . for the case of the lyapunov exponent , we also suppose @xmath56 .",
    "then @xmath57 and @xmath58    \\(ii ) ( parabolic regime ) let @xmath59 , then @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by integrals written out explicitly in section  [ sec - bandedge ] . for @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are independent of @xmath66 , namely the result is the same as for @xmath67 .",
    "\\(iii ) ( hyperbolic regime ) let @xmath68 and let the sign of @xmath53 be such that @xmath54 is outside the band of @xmath55 .",
    "then @xmath69 and @xmath70    the result is summarized in figure  [ fig - phasediagram ] .",
    "all the error estimates , in particular , the value of @xmath71 , are controlled more explicitely and given in section  [ sec - bandedge ] .",
    "as will become more clear below , the terms elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic regimes reflect the nature of the corresponding averaged transfer matrix to lowest order in @xmath16 .",
    "let us point out that we do not provide the asymptotics for the ids in the hyperbolic regime , but only give an upper bound on it .",
    "actually the ids between the lifshitz tails and the band edge of the periodic operator is exponentially small in @xmath16 , a fact that results from a more delicate large deviation behavior .",
    "this will be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "the lifshitz tails themselves were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ theo - scaling ] begins ( in section  [ sec - normal ] ) with an adequate basis change on the transfer matrices .",
    "a band edge is characterized by the fact that the modulus of the trace of the transfer matrix is @xmath72 .",
    "if there is no band touching , the transfer matrix is then not diagonalizable and its normal form is hence a jordan block ( appendix a ) .",
    "the action of a jordan block on projective space ( in fact , identified with the prfer phases ) has exactly one fixed point , which is unstable under random pertubations induced by the randomness in the hamiltonian . in order to analyse the associated invariant distribution on projective space ,",
    "a further basis change blowing up the vicinity of the fixed point is necessary .",
    "if this is done adequately , a formal perturbative calculation typically leads to a differential equation for the invariant distribution .    instead of studying the concrete form of the random matrices obtained in section  [ sec - normal ] after the various basis changes , we rather choose to single out the more general concept of an anomaly of a family of random matrices ( _ cf .",
    "_ section  [ sec - anomalies ] ) .",
    "the term anomaly is chosen by reference to the center of band anomaly in the one - dimensional anderson model as studied by kappus and wegner @xcite .",
    "the latter is a special case which is analyzed in a prior work @xcite .",
    "the formalism to calculate the lyapunov exponents and rotation numbers at a general anomaly is built up in section  [ sec - dynamics ] .",
    "in particular , it turns out that one needs to evaluate certain birkhoff sums for the perturbative calculation of these quantities .",
    "the perturbative evaluation of these birkhoff sums directly leads to a differential operator on projective space ( propositions [ prop - ellipt ] and [ prop - dgl ] ) . in some situations this operator is of first order , and",
    "consequently the anomaly is called first order as well ( this is dealt with in section  [ sec - elliptic ] ) . however , in the more interesting cases treated in sections  [ sec - fp ] and [ sec-2nd ] , the differential operator is of second order and of the fokker - planck type .",
    "the latter operator was already used in @xcite in order to study the center of band anomaly , but here one is confronted with the supplementary difficulty that its ellipticity is destroyed at a band edge .",
    "thus a thorough analysis of the corresponding singularities is needed . section  [ sec - fp ] deals with the fokker - planck operator and its groundstate , while section  [ sec-2nd ] shows how it is used to calculate the birkhoff sums .",
    "both sections heavily depend on appendix b , where inhomogeneous singular first order ordinary differential equations are studied in detail",
    ". sections  [ sec - anomalies ] up to [ sec-2nd ] are kept slightly more general than needed for the proof of theorem  [ theo - scaling ] as completed in section  [ sec - bandedge ] , but we hope that this stresses the structural aspects of the analysis",
    ". there may possibly also be further applications .",
    "* acknowledgment : * we are thankful to andreas knauf for numerous comments and discussions .",
    "this work was support by the dfg .",
    "in this section we motivate and carry out the basis changes on the transfer matrices in the vicinity of a band edge . the final normal forms obtained in the various regimes",
    "will then motivate the definition of the term anomaly in the next section .",
    "first , one rewrites the schrdinger equation @xmath73 , with @xmath39 , @xmath19 and @xmath18 as given in , in the standard way using transfer matrices ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . due to the periodicity of @xmath55 it is convenient to introduce the transfer matrix over @xmath13 sites associated to one configuration @xmath27 of the disorder on these sites : @xmath74 note that @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 . if @xmath42 is a band edge of @xmath55 , then @xmath77 and , because there is no band touching , @xmath78 .",
    "one can show that necessarily @xmath79 has only one eigenvector ( see appendix a ) .",
    "hence one can find a basis change @xmath80 such that @xmath81 is a jordan block with eigenvalue either @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "this elementary fact was already efficiently used for the analysis of the lifshitz tails @xcite . using this basis change , one can write the full energy rescaled transfer matrix as follows : @xmath84 here the exponents @xmath85 are in @xmath86 ,",
    "are put into increasing order @xmath87 and the @xmath88 are in the lie algebra @xmath89 .",
    "hence the lowest terms are @xmath90 or @xmath91 , pending on the value of @xmath92 .",
    "let us note that @xmath93 are independent of @xmath94 unless @xmath95 . also , @xmath96 unless there is a @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",
    "each combination of the signs can occur , the one inside the exponential indicates if it is a lower ( + sign ) or an upper ( - sign ) bandedge . for sake of concreteness , we choose both signs positive .    a few further remarks on the @xmath88 will be relevant later on . because there is no band touching at @xmath42 , for @xmath99 one gets @xmath100 where the first identity follows from the definition , duhamel s formula and the cyclicity of the trace , and the second one defines @xmath101 . by the same calculation ( with @xmath67 ) @xmath102 the latter by definition of the centered random variable @xmath46 .",
    "of course this expression is centered because the perturbation is centered .",

    "it has an unstable parabolic fixed point at @xmath108 , which is being approached from the left under the dynamics without passing it though . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the dynamics is the same to lowest order @xmath110 , but the random perturbations of higher order may allow the dynamics to cross through @xmath108 .",
    "nevertheless , the angles @xmath111 are close to @xmath108 for most @xmath112 and thus their distribution is more and more concentrated in the vicinity of @xmath108 as @xmath16 tends to @xmath113 and , in fact , converges weakly to a dirac peak . in order to extract the shape of the non - trivial distribution it is necessary to rescale the neighborhood of @xmath108 with an adequate power of @xmath16",
    "this is done by conjugation with @xmath114 the conjugation has the following effect on @xmath115 matrices : @xmath116 one deduces from @xmath117 note that the powers of @xmath16 appearing in the exponential now lie in @xmath118 , but none is negative for @xmath119 .",
    "the following three contributions of low order in @xmath16 turn out to be relevant : @xmath120 where the notation reflects that @xmath121 is independent of @xmath94 . by equations and",
    ", @xmath122 has a non - vanishing constant entry only in the lower left corner unless @xmath67 .",
    "similarly by and , @xmath123 has a centered random entry in the lower left corner with positive variance , while all the other entries vanish .",
    "it is helpful to think of @xmath124 and @xmath122 as drift terms in the action , and of @xmath123 as generator of a diffusion .",
    "now we blow up the parabolic fixed point by augmenting @xmath71 until the drift @xmath124 is of same order of magnitude as either the drift @xmath122 ( then @xmath125 ) or the diffusive force ( variance ) of @xmath123 ( then @xmath126 so that @xmath127 )",
    ". hence we choose @xmath128 explicitely , for @xmath52 , one has with this choice of @xmath71 @xmath129 where @xmath130 and the specific form of @xmath131 and @xmath132 will not be of importance for the asymptotics of theorem  [ theo - scaling ] . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the second term is of lower order than the first , but as it is centered , we shall see that it does not enter into the asymptotics of the ids and the lyapunov exponent because its variance is smaller than @xmath134 . hence is an anomaly of first order in the sense of the following section . in the case",

    "the case ( v ) is identical , once the sides @xmath546 and @xmath547 are exchanged in the above argument . in case ( vi ) , one has @xmath592 ( namely , for both @xmath593 and @xmath594 ) , so that one has to construct the solution as in both for @xmath546 and @xmath547 ; hence the solution is unique . in case ( vii ) , one has @xmath595 and the homogeneous solutions on both sides vanish at @xmath531 faster than any power , so that one has a two - parameter family of solutions .    finally let us consider @xmath537 and first the case ( ii ) .",
    "hence @xmath592 so that @xmath596 .",
    "now the second limit in ( [ eq - asympt ] ) may diverge to @xmath597 , but one readily checks that @xmath598 is integrable so that @xmath323 can be defined as in for @xmath546 and @xmath547 .",
    "now the continuity is proven as above , and higher derivatives can also be treated as above because @xmath599 so that both nominator and numerator of @xmath600 converge to @xmath113 and de lhopital s rule may be applied as before .    in case ( iii ) , @xmath601 so that @xmath602 .",
    "furthermore @xmath598 is never integrable and the two - parameter family of solutions @xmath534 is defined as in .",
    "the main point to note is that @xmath603 , hence @xmath604 under the hypothesis stated in ( iii ) .",
    "thus de lhopital s rule can be invoked to calculate @xmath605 as above ( with the index @xmath112 shifted by @xmath82 ) .",
    "let us remark that in case @xmath606 , one can prove better differentiability , but only for a one - parameter family of solutions ( just as for the ode @xmath607 , @xmath608 ) ."
