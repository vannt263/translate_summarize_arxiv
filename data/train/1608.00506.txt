    "isolation of two dimensional ( 2d ) materials during the last decade seems to revolutionize the common understandings in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "graphene as the most known of these materials , besides attracting much interest from a fundamental point of view , has opened a new route to application in electronic devices @xcite . on the other hand , despite lacking intrinsic magnetic properties due to the long spin relaxation time , graphene has been suggested to be used in spintronics @xcite .",
    "very soon after graphene , the transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) with layered van der waals structure , have been exfoliated to few- and single - layer crystalline samples @xcite .",
    "they exhibit diverse electronic characteristics starting from metallic and semiconducting to more exotic phases , including superconducting and even charge density wave @xcite . as a general characteristic ,",
    "most of theses materials reveal a very large intrinsic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) which has made them very promising for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the combination of the large soi with two - valley band structure and the presence of a direct band gap , make a monolayer of tmds as a building block for valleytronics and optoelectronics .",
    "in particular , using circularly polarized light , various groups observed an optically induced valley polarization @xcite , which eventually enabled the experimental verification of the valley hall effect @xcite .",
    "various groups have studied spin dependent effects in tmds as well as their magnetic properties not only because of possible application , but also due to the fundamental interests .",
    "it has been predicted that ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida interaction between magnetic impurities consists of heisenberg , ising and dzyaloshinsky - moriya terms @xcite owing to the large spin splitting of the valence band and hexagonal symmetry of monolayer mos@xmath1 .",
    "it has been found , on the other hand , that the spin - orbit mediated spin relaxation results in spin lifetimes larger than nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "these relaxation mechanisms are consequences of the rashba spin - orbit coupling and dyakonov - perel contribution induced by interactions and impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "other studies have indicated that only the intervalley electron - phonon scattering has a significant effect on the intrinsic in - plane spin relaxation among other scattering mechanism @xcite . besides spin relaxation phenomena caused by the soi",
    ", different groups have explored the emergence of magnetic phases in tmds . in particular ,",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "calculations for mos@xmath1 have suggested that doping with either transition metals including mn , fe , co , re or vacancies and defects could make the system ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical and experimental studies have found signatures of magnetism at the edges and grain boundaries of these materials @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties of tmds monolayers ( ml ) is the large spin splitting in the valence band which originates from the soi and changes its sign between two inequivalent valleys @xcite .",
    "this property would affect the spin dependent scattering phenomena , for instance , in the presence of magnetic impurities .",
    "so motivated by this fact , we will address the magnetic impurity problem in doped tmds - ml with particular focus on the low temperatures and at the vicinity of the kondo regime .",
    "_ the kondo effect _ , in its orthodox form , is revealed as a logarithmic upturn in the low temperature resistivity of metals dilutely doped with magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "this behavior originates from the strong antiferromagnetic correlation between conduction electrons and the localized magnetic moments which are coupled to each other with a constant @xmath2 @xcite . as a first attempt",
    ", jun kondo employed the perturbation theory to obtain the @xmath3 contribution in the resistivity .",
    "his theory was able to explain the appearance of the resistance minimum at a temperature @xmath4 due to the competition between the phonon and nonmagnetic impurities contributions to that of magnetic impurities . by extensions of the perturbation approach , abrikosov summed up the leading logarithmic contributions from the higher order scattering processes which led to a divergent behavior for the resistivity at the so - called kondo temperature @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this observation was a signal indicating strong scatterings of the conduction electrons by the local magnetic moments . from the breakdown point of the perturbation , a non - analytical dependence of @xmath0 on the coupling constant @xmath2 with the form",
    "@xmath5 was found , in which @xmath6 is the density of states ( dos ) of the conduction electrons . using the more powerful methods which were developed afterwards , the exponential dependence of the kondo temperature on the inverse of coupling constant was verified and precise form of the prefactor @xmath7 was obtained .",
    "on the other hand , more satisfactory solutions of _ the kondo problem _ revealed that the local moments are gradually screened by the conduction electrons at very low temperatures @xmath8 .",
    "this picture has been confirmed during 70 s and 80 s by a variety of techniques in particular the renormalization group ( rg ) and exact methods among others @xcite .    in this paper , by exploiting the perturbation theory and poor man s renormalization method of anderson and focusing on the regime of temperatures above kondo ( @xmath9 ) , the onset of the kondo effect in tmds - ml is studied .",
    "we find that the low - order spin dependent scatterings are suppressed in the spin - split region of the band structure while they remain strong at higher doping strengths when the fermi level crosses both spin subbands . in contrast , the kondo temperature is not strongly affected even when the fermi level is inside the spin split region and crosses only one spin subband at each valley .",
    "this result is also verified using the poor man s scaling analysis which is very similar in spirit to the wilson s numerical rg method @xcite .",
    "to understand these results we notice that in the vicinity of @xmath0 there are equal probabilities for inter- and intra - valley scatterings owing to the short - range exchange interactions with magnetic impurities .",
    "subsequently the kondo characteristics in the case in which the fermi level lies inside the spin split region are more or less the same as heavily doped cases in which the fermi level is deep inside the valence or conduction band .",
    "our findings indicate some differences with the investigations of the kondo effect in other 2d systems such as graphene @xcite as well as those in the presence of the soi @xcite . besides fundamental importances",

    "we start by writing down the low - energy band structure of ml - mos@xmath1 which consists of two valleys , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are time - reversal with respect to each other . in the vicinity of each valley",

    "the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are given by @xmath23 as it will be clear in the following , the kondo temperature and related transport properties are mostly influenced by the density of states corresponding to the low - energy bands .",
    "then we use the following approximate form of the dos for each spin index , @xmath24 with constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are different basically due to the difference in the electron and hole effective masses @xcite .",
    "the other important band parameters are the semiconducting gap @xmath27 ev and the intrinsic soi strength @xmath28 mev .    in order to study the effect of dilute magnetic impurities",

    "since we are dealing with the low - energy model of tmds - ml , it is consistent to consider the hybridization between impurity and the itinerant electrons in the dirac delta function form @xmath36 .",
    "subsequently , there will be no momentum dependence in @xmath37 in the orbital basis model hamiltonian of the system .",
    "although the projection of the band basis model ( e.g. the two - band model ) might result in a momentum dependence in the hybridization , we assume a constant value for it as a reasonable approximation due to the considerably larger energy band gap of mos@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the hybridization in the lattice models when the impurity is exactly placed in a transition metal site should be constant in analogy with the case of graphene when impurities on top of carbon atoms @xcite .",
    "one should note that owing to the similar electronic structure , the magnetic impurities are energetically preferred to replace a transition metal atom of tmd .        in order to address the kondo effect and subsequently spin lifetime owing to the magnetic scattering",

    "in which the coupling constant diverges , the kondo temperature will be obtained .",
    "we already know that we can consider three different regimes for the doping of tmds depending on the position of the chemical potential , namely : @xmath109-doped , intermediate @xmath110-doped when only one of the spin split subbands is intersected , and heavily @xmath110-doped . for the sake of simplicity in the first case",
    ", only the contribution of the conduction band is taken into account while in the second and third cases , one of the valence subbands or both are considered .",
    "therefore , we always have a fictitious band over the range @xmath111 , while only a part of it has finite dos .",
    "so , there will be certain range of cutoffs for which only one edge of the fictitious band has a finite contribution .",
    "on the other hand , when the cutoff @xmath106 is made small enough under rg , both edges of the band will contribute in the kondo scattering .",
    "hence , the scaled fictitious band lies completely inside either conduction or valence band and subsequently @xmath112 becomes constant for small enough cutoffs @xmath113 .",

    "the resulting screening becomes stronger .",
    "this behavior is indicated by the decline in the denominator which equivalently leads to the shorter transport and spin lifetimes . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the slope of decrease in the valence band , especially for @xmath124 is much higher which originates from the increase in the strength of the exchange coupling coefficient ( @xmath125 ) when the fermi level is closer to the impurity level .",
    "more intriguingly , when the fermi level is in the valence or conduction band due to the thermal excitations , the function varies with temperature .",
    "in particular for the particular set of parameters considered here and assuming typical few kelvin temperatures ( @xmath126 ) , one sees that at some certain values of doping , the denominator vanishes revealing a divergence in the scattering rates as a signature of kondo criticality .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig . [ fig2](b ) where the dimensionless scattering rate @xmath127 is plotted as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "as expected inside the gap the rate is vanishing and the lifetime is infinitely large while for doped cases the exchange coupling gives rise to finite scattering rate .",
    "an apparent strange observation is the fact that scattering rate is very small for the regimes fermi level lies inside the spin split part of the valence band , while it is considerably larger in the conduction band and much stronger in valence when @xmath96 is below the lower spin subbands maxima .",
    "this unexpected behavior can be seen as a clear signature of the fact that in the spin split region in each valley only one type of spins does exist .",
    "therefore , the exchange screening is significantly weak unlike the situations that carriers with both spins from both valleys are present at the fermi level .      in this part",

    "the only exceptional case is @xmath132 with an unusually large slope of variations . in this case , the dos is smaller since the fermi level attains the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) .",

    "the kondo effect becomes more profound indicated by a higher value of the kondo temperature .",

    "these two extra contributions dominate at zero temperature and very high temperatures , respectively , and are not considered here . from our result in the vicinity of a strong kondo screening regime , which the scattering due to the exchange interaction with magnetic impurities is dominant , the total resistivity increases by lowering the temperature . on the other hand , it is known that at higher temperatures ( @xmath150 ) the electron - phonon contribution can lead to a @xmath151 dependence of the resistivity over temperature @xcite .",
    "then from the combination of these two contributions in the resistivity , one can easily expect that the appearance of the minimum resistivity at a temperature @xmath4 which is usually larger than @xmath0 . it should be noticed that in contrast to the kondo temperature , @xmath4 can be varied with the concentration of impurities and also the parameters related to the electron - phonon iterations .",
    "it is worth commenting on the relation between our results with previous investigations about the kondo effect in 2d materials , including two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , graphene , and topological surface states .",
    "first of all , in the case of 2deg due to the constancy of dos , the kondo temperature is not tunable via doping whatsoever .",
    "however , recently an enhancement of the kondo temperature with rashba soi has been predicted at constant low fillings , due to the emergence of dzyaloshinsky - moriya type exchange term @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional 2deg , theoretical investigations have suggested strong doping dependence of the kondo effect in graphene @xcite .",
    "remaining under some debates , there are also experimental evidences for the tunability of @xmath0 with chemical potential  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been shown that kondo effect in graphene can show a quantum critical behavior with power low dependence of @xmath0 on the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "such behavior mostly originates from the linear dispersion as well as the existence of dirac points in graphene @xcite .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations about kondo features in surface states of topological insulators which are doped with magnetic impurities has been carried out by various groups @xcite . in particular , it has been revealed that despite the spin - momentum locking , the magnetic impurities are kondo screened by the surface - state electrons which have dirac dispersion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to all above mentioned gapless 2d systems , tmds - ml have a dispersion relation similar to gapped dirac systems besides the spin splitting present in the valence band with different sign for the different valleys . then , as it has been discussed before , the transport properties and kondo physics at the presence of magnetic impurities are mostly governed by gapped quadratic spectrum of the tmds - ml and particularly the linear energy dependence of dos . unlike graphene and other gapless systems no quantum critical behavior is observed and irrespective of the strength of @xmath128 the system is always in the strong coupling limit revealed by the rg equations obtained from poor man s scaling . on the other hand",
    "the kondo temperature is weakly influenced by the spin splitting .",
    "in particular in the spin split regime of doping the kondo effect is slightly weakened due to the decline in dos .",
    "the origin of behavior is owing to the presence of valley degree of freedom and intervalley scatterings providing the channel for spin - flip processes and subsequently the kondo screening .    finally , regarding the possible experimental investigations , we note that in the context of graphene , the localized magnetic moments can be usually formed via the defects @xcite .",
    "hence , the kondo physics of graphene despite the various studies so far , needs to be understood more clearly by further experimental and theoretical studies . nevertheless , in tmds",
    "the magnetic adatoms as well as defects can lead to the localized magnetic moments which has been verified by _ ab initio _",
    "studies @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ionic liquid gating method provides an extreme tunability of the chemical potential in tmds - ml @xcite .",
    "therefore we can conclude that it is quite feasible to experimentally check the results obtained here for the kondo effect and minimum resistivity .",
    "in summary , we have used perturbation theory to investigate the effect of dilute magnetic impurities in the kondo characteristics and spin relaxation inside a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides .",
    "it is shown that inside the valence band , due to the large spin splitting , the transport lifetime and spin relaxation are much longer when the fermi level is in the spin split region in comparison with situations in which the chemical potential is deep inside the valence band and crosses both spin subbands . in strong contrast , although the lowest orders of spin - dependent scattering is strong only when the fermi level lies deep in the conduction or valence band , however , the kondo effect is not suppressed even in the spin - split region . such behavior , which is also checked using poor man s scaling analysis , originates from the many body character of the kondo effect and the fact that in the kondo screening , electrons can be equally scattered inside each valley or between them .",
    "we further investigate the effect of doping and impurity levels on the kondo temperature as well as the temperature dependence of the magnetic impurities contribution in the conductivity .",
    "although it is not explicitly considered here , combining the contribution of magnetic impurities with that of electron - phonon scatterings which is dominant at higher temperatures , one would expect the appearance of a minimum at the resistivity as a function of temperature .",
    "finally the possible experimental verification of the kondo effect in transition metal dichalcogenides is discussed .",

    "all of the second order @xmath56-matrix terms versus @xmath162 and @xmath163 , will contain a summation over the intermediate ( virtual ) states @xmath164 . moreover depending on the character of the virtual states as an electron or a hole ,",
    "their corresponding occupancies described by the fermi distributions will appear . replacing the summation over the momenta with integration over the energy and using the simplified notation as @xmath165 and @xmath166 ,",

    "then in order to keep the consistency of perturbation the impurity level @xmath32 and host electron energy , namely the chemical potential @xmath96 should be far from each other . therefore , without any problem we can substitute @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "one can immediately see that the last two terms in ( [ eq : q ] ) diverge when the host electrons energy hits the impurity level .",
    "but this is of course beyond the validity of the perturbative formalism . on this ground and for the sake of consistency and simplicity",
    ", we do not take these terms into account .",
    "moreover , since the initial and final state energies are equal we immediately see the relation @xmath175 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this assumption leads to an effective coupling coefficient @xmath2 instead of all coupling coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the hamiltonian ( [ exchange ] ) and is given by , @xmath176 which finally yields to the expression ( [ j ] ) in the main text ."
