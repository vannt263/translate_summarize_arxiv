    "recently , first - principles theoretical predictions of crystalline fe / mgo / fe tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) on the order of several hundred percent or more@xcite were confirmed in series of notable experiments.@xcite with optimization efforts continuing , this dramatic tmr enhancement has placed magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) devices in a unique position to revolutionize memory , magnetic sensor , and computing technologies.@xcite    the large tunneling magnetoresistance of crystalline fe / mgo / fe junctions can be understood in terms of the symmetry of the mgo crystal , which allows states with @xmath0 symmetry to transmit efficiently through the band gap of mgo while states of @xmath1 symmetry decay rapidly.@xcite near the fermi energy , the fe majority and minority states are primarily of @xmath0 and @xmath2 symmetry respectively .",
    "therefore the mgo barrier acts as a spin filter , resulting in half - metallic like conduction between @xmath0 states on opposite sides of the barrier .",
    "studies have shown that only a single crystalline fe layer adjacent to mgo is sufficient to produce most of the tmr observed in thicker fe / mgo / fe devices.@xcite recently , it was also suggested that spin torque transfer largely occurs at the fe / mgo interface.@xcite therefore it is essential that any fe / mgo / fe mtj device transport model correctly capture the physical properties of the fe / mgo interface .    from a computational perspective",
    ", the scalability of density functional theory ( dft ) in magnetic metals presents serious limitations.@xcite for example , the study of spin torque@xcite and tmr through large scale mtj cross sections interspersed with magnetic impurities and/or crystal defects @xcite would be computationally prohibitive .",
    "scalability is particularly problematic in non - collinear magnetic tunnel junction systems , where the calculation convergence time can be prodigious @xcite due to the additional spin degree of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the tendency of dft to underestimate semiconductor and insulator band gaps limits its capability to quantitatively model device transport characteristics .",
    "for example in magnetic tunnel junctions , the commonly applied local spin density approximation ( lsda)@xcite significantly underestimates the mgo band gap and therefore over estimates the tunneling current and spin - torque transfer . in light of these concerns",
    ", we are motivated to study the applicability of employing the semi - empirical pseudopotential method @xcite in the context of fe / mgo / fe magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) .",
    "the semi - empirical pseudopotential method ( herein known by the abbreviation sep ) assumes that the hartree and exchange - correlation potential interaction between electrons in a crystal lattice can be well approximated by an angular dependent or spherically symmetric potential situated at each atomic site . in its simplest form , where we assume a spherically symmetric sep , the approach is analogous to the atomic sphere approximation .",
    "@xcite the sep approximation was first applied to plane wave calculations and benchmarked with respect to the bulk properties of si and cdse.@xcite the implementation was later scaled up and applied to the study of quantum dot systems @xcite possessing a large number of atoms . by optimizing the sep parameter set one is able to correct the band gap of the modeled material while maintaining dft wavefunction accuracy.@xcite the latter feature is of utmost importance in fe / mgo / fe tunnel junctions , where wavefunction symmetry plays a pivotal role in the device transport characteristics .",
    "furthermore , this approximation removes the need for a self - consistent convergence loop and therefore allows for the study of much larger systems .",
    "the method is also appealing from a tight - binding perspective , @xcite since it offers the same computational advantages and yet is able to rapidly produce an accurate parameterization without employing sophisticated optimization algorithms.@xcite    building upon previous theoretical studies , @xcite we examine the applicability of employing semi - empirical pseudopotentials ( seps ) @xcite for the study of fe / mgo / fe tunnel junctions within a real space localized basis set calculations ( rather than plane wave calculations @xcite ) .",
    "the discussion is divided in two parts .",
    "firstly , the sep extraction method is described in detail .",
    "secondly , we evaluate the sep method with respect to bulk , interface and thin barrier parameterizations .",
    "the method is first benchmarked against bulk fe and bulk mgo lsda band structure calculations .",
    "subsequently , we show that the bulk derived seps are _ unable _ to quantitatively capture the lsda derived fe / mgo / fe interface and thin barrier tunneling characteristics .",
    "@xcite to overcome this shortcoming we therefore introduce a separate interface parameterization through the concept of _ ghost _ semi - empirical potentials localized between the fe and mgo interface atoms . with these interface corrections , we are then able to quantitatively capture dft tunneling through thin barriers .",
    "it is shown that an accurate interface parameterization is required for barrier widths in the range of 1 nm , where interface states on opposite sides of the barrier can couple strongly .",
    "we also evaluate the transferability and importance of mgo barrier band gap corrections with respect to the total barrier transmission .",
    "in general the results underscore the need for separate interface and bulk parameterization sets when modeling electron transport through thin tunnel junctions .",
    "we briefly outline our simulation method in this section in two parts .",
    "firstly , we outline the chosen local atomic orbital dft method .",
    "secondly , we discuss the real space semi - empirical pseudopotential approximation applied in this work .",
    "the self - consistent non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) dft transport method applied in this work has been discussed extensively in previous publications.@xcite      the local atomic orbital pseudopotential dft time independent hamiltonian can be expressed as , @xmath3 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the pseudopotential term , @xmath5 is the hartree term , @xmath6 is the exchange - correlation potential term and @xmath7 is the system charge density .",
    "we may expand the pseudopotential expression further into local and non - local terms following the klienman - bylander prescription,@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the atomic index and @xmath10 is a summation taken across the pseudopotentials of each atomic position .",
    "however , @xmath11 is usually long ranged ( which reduces the sparsity of the hamiltonian ) and therefore also computationally problematic .",
    "thus , we screen @xmath11 @xcite by populating the orbitals of the isolated atom and arrive at a short ranged neutral atom potential , @xmath12 , for each atomic species . the preferred local atomic orbital hamiltonian is then written as @xmath13,&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that the modified hartree term is given by @xmath14 .",

    ", the semi - empirical pseudopotential approximation @xcite assumes that all local terms may approximated by a spherically symmetric local potential around each atom .",
    "this is objective is partially accomplished by including @xmath12 but to arrive at a proper spherical potential at each atomic site we must also reduce @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that , @xmath19 \\approx \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{n } v_{\\alpha}(|{\\bf r } - { \\bf r}_{\\alpha}| ) .",

    "the full semi - empirical pseudopotential is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the approach is similar in spirit to the atomic sphere approximation applied in the muffin - tin orbital method.@xcite although not done here , angular dependence may be introduced to the sep term .",
    "this leads to a revised hamiltonian operator , @xmath22 which does not require a self - consistent loop to solve since there is no interdependence between the semi - empirical pseudopotentials and the charge density .",
    "the term  semi - empirical \" is applied because these potentials are initially derived from first - principles calculations and then fitted to experimental data if required  in this work to overcome the lsda band gap underestimation .",
    "finally , we would like to extract the sep for each atomic species from a self - consistent dft calculation .",
    "let us assume that the spherical approximation to the self - consistent hartree and exchange - correlation terms , @xmath23 , goes to zero beyond a cutoff radius of @xmath24  which is not necessarily equivalent to the cutoff radius of @xmath25 .",
    "note that the zero potential condition outside the cutoff radius may be adjusted , for example by adding a positive offset to the real space dft potential . within the cutoff radius",
    "we may define a complete orthonormal basis @xcite to represent @xmath23 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 where the potential is represented by a linear expansion of the zeroth order spherical bessel function  the eigenfunctions of an electron with no angular momentum trapped in an infinite spherical well of radius @xmath24 . note that higher order spherical bessel functions are not able to capture a non - zero system potential at the atomic origin .",

    "[ fig5 ] ) where the bulk sep pdos begins to diverge from the lsda pdos . further within the mgo barrier ( layer 11 in fig .  [ fig5 ] )",
    "the bulk sep and ghost sep parameterizations both capture the lsda calculated mgo band gap as it begins to reappear .",
    "the agreement between the sep and lsda results at layer 11 fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , clearly shows that that sharp sep fit errors located on the o atoms in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] do not influence the barrier electronic structure ( see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2.2 ] ) .    returning to the interface , we see that the layer 8 negf - lsda result ( in dashed dark blue in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) displays the characteristic fe / mgo interface pdos including the minority pdos fermi energy resonant peak.@xcite yet if we turn our attention to the bulk sep pdos layer 8 result ( shown in green in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we see a noticeable disagreement , namely the characteristic twin peak ( @xmath2 and @xmath0 as labeled in fig .  [ fig5 ] ) fe minority and majority pdos resonances are markedly distorted and in the case of the majority interface states there is a further 0.75 ev upwards shift . this upwards shift in the interface bulk sep majority interface states is due entirely to the positive nature of the interface error as shown by the green potential plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a .",
    "the @xmath0 interface state decays slowly into the mgo barrier and the @xmath2 interface state decays rapidly into the mgo barrier ( see sec .  [ sec3.2.4 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the 2 ev exchange splitting between the majority and minority carriers results in half - metallic like conduction between the slowly decaying @xmath0 interface states , which dominate the tmr and spin torque characteristics of fe / mgo / fe junctions.@xcite by first distorting the @xmath0 minority / majority interface states and then shifting the majority @xmath0 interface state by 0.75 ev , the bulk sep approximation introduces considerable error into the half - metallic properties of the the fe / mgo / fe tunneling as we show in further detail in the next section .",
    "however , the ghost seps clearly ( as shown in red in the second column of fig .  [ fig5 ] )",
    "are able to almost entirely compensate the for bulk sep pdos interface transferability errors .",
    "this quantitative result is achieved with only first order ( spherically symmetric ) ghost seps , where angular dependent interface ghost seps might be necessary for more complex heterojunction interfaces .",
    "thus far we have performed a detailed analysis of the interface potential and pdos errors ( see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) which result when bulk seps are transfered to fe / mgo / fe tunnel junctions . yet , for the purposes of electron device modeling we are most interested in the transport implications of such interface errors . in this",
    "regard , previous studies have shown resonant interface states can significantly influence the transmission@xcite and spin torque@xcite properties of mtj barriers .    the zero - bias total transmission of our fe / mgo / fe tunneling device geometry ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] )",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "the lsda transmission is shown in dashed dark blue , the bulk sep transmission in green , the ghost sep transmission in solid red , and the mgo band gap corrected transmission is shown in dotted black ( recall the dot - dashed gold correction potentials displayed in figs .  [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b ) . the zero bias parallel orientation up spin transmission is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a , the parallel orientation down spin transmission is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , and the antiparallel transmission is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6]c .",
    "an initial inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig6]a through [ fig6]c , both above and below the fermi energy where the fe / mgo interface states are more prominent , reveals sizable transmission corrections between the bulk sep result ( in solid green ) and the ghost sep result ( in solid red )  where the latter matches the ldsa transmission ( in dashed blue ) quantitatively .",
    "the fe / mgo / fe transmission characteristics are determined by the rapid decay of the @xmath59 interface state and slow decay of the @xmath60 interface state within mgo , resulting in half - metallic like tunneling between majority and minority @xmath60 fe / mgo interface states on opposite sides of the barrier ( see layer 8 in fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the half - metallic like conduction is immediately evident , where at -1 ev in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and at + 1 ev in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b we see a large rise in transmission corresponding to the onset of the majority and minority spin @xmath60 states respectively ( also shown on layer 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    the fermi energy ( set at 0 ev in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) low bias tmr for the lsda , bulk sep and ghost sep methods is calculated to be 99.85 , 59.39 , 97.47 respectively .",
    "the bulk sep approximation underestimates the fe / mgo / fe low bias tmr by 30% , and the ghost sep interface corrections are able to compensate quite accurately .",
    "this low bias error is due entirely to the @xmath60 majority interface state broadening / shift and as shown on layer 8 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig6]a where the bulk sep ( solid green ) transmission is shifted by 0.5 ev .",
    "the minority spin @xmath59 interface state is not significantly altered by the bulk sep approximation ( see layer 8 in fig .  [ fig5 ] ) resulting in little change in the half - metallic like transmission at the fermi energy of the @xmath60 interface states in the anti - parallel orientation ( see fig .  [",
    "the same holds for the parallel minority transmission although it s contribution to the low bias parallel current is negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) .    though the minority spin @xmath59 interface state transmission is not significantly altered by the bulk sep ( solid green ) transferability error , the",
    "minority spin @xmath60 interface state zero bias transmission is however drastically underestimated between 0 ev and 1 ev ( see fig .  [",
    "similarly , we can see a notable underestimation of the majority spin bulk sep ( solid green ) @xmath60 zero bias transmission between -1 ev and 0 ev as shown in fig .",
    "given the half - metallic like spin filtering property of the mgo barrier , in which tunneling between @xmath60 states dominates , these errors have a significant impact on the biased tunneling current . without the ghost",
    "sep interface corrections , the parallel tunneling current is underestimated by a factor of 2 and the antiparallel current by up to an order of magnitude within the bias window of 1 v as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]d ( compare the ghost sep solid red and bulk sep solid green results ) . furthermore , in fig .",
    "[ fig6]e the bulk sep ( solid green ) fe / mgo / fe tmr displays sizable deviations from the interface corrected ghost sep ( solid red ) tmr , lacking the characteristic smooth decay under bias.@xcite    similar , though less sizable , interface errors occur when we introduce bulk sep mgo band gap corrections to our ghost sep fe / mgo / fe hamiltonian ( see dotted black transmission plots in figs .  [ fig6]a through [ fig6]c ) .",
    "the bulk sep mgo band gap corrections are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a and figs .  [ fig2]b ( see gold dot - dashed lines read off the left axis ) .",
    "reaching up to 5 bohr , these band gap corrections extend into the fe / mgo interface and suffer the same transferability problem as the uncorrected bulk seps .",
    "however , from figs .",
    "[ fig6]a through [ fig6]c it is evident that the primary role of the band gap correction is to lower the tunneling current by an order of magnitude ( as expected ) .",
    "likewise , the band gap correct tmr ratio at 43.94 compared to the lsda tmr ratio of 99.85 , can be attributed to the reintroduced interface state errors rather than a fundamental alteration in the fe spin filtering properties of mgo.@xcite however , it may be necessary in future studies to simultaneously address the nature of fe / mgo interface states and mgo exchange - correlation corrections beyond the lsda approximation.@xcite",
    "we have detailed a straight forward method for extracting semi - empirical pseudopotentials from real space dft calculations .",
    "the method has been shown to produce accurate bulk derived spherical seps , matching self - consistent lsda band structure results to within 0.1 ev .",
    "subsequently , we examined the transferability of bulk derived mgo and fe seps to fe / mgo / fe tunnel junctions .",
    "it was shown that lsda calculated fe / mgo interface states are not adequately described by bulk seps . as a result bulk seps",
    "can significantly underestimate or overestimate of the spin dependent transmission through thin fe / mgo / fe tunnel junctions .",
    "however , the sep tight binding method allows characterization of both the system layer by layer pdos and real space potential . primarily due to the local chemical environment change experienced by interface mg atoms , where the number of nearest neighbors is reduced from six to five",
    ", an interface fit is required to overcome bulk transferability errors .",
    "therefore , we put forward the notion of ghost seps , not localized at an atomic site but within the interface , to parameterize dft calculated heterojunctions .",
    "the ghost seps interface parameterization was shown to completely recover the lsda interface pdos and fe / mgo / fe transmission characteristics .",
