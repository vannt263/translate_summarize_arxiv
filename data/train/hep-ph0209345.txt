    ", this idea has been extensively investigated by berera and co - workers @xcite .",
    "while some frictional effect is to be expected in any interacting field theory , it is by no means clear at a fundamental level that this effect can properly be represented by a local equation of motion such as ( [ localeom ] ) , and the purpose of the present paper is to study this question in some detail .",

    "dissipative effects in the equation of motion ( [ geneom ] ) can arise from the final term @xmath14 , but we concentrate here on those arising from the other expectation values , which are quadratic in the quantum fields .",
    "generically , the equation of motion is @xmath15 where @xmath16 may stand for @xmath12 , the fluctuating part of @xmath2 , for another scalar field @xmath3 or for a fermionic field @xmath4 , and has a @xmath8-dependent mass of the form ( [ masses ] ) . in general",
    ", there will be a sum of such contributions from the fields appearing in a specific model , but our considerations are substantially model - independent .    superficially , it is quite plausible that a system which remains fairly close to equilibrium can be treated by using equilibrium statistical mechanics . in section  [ etd ] ,",
    "we review the relevant dissipative mechanisms and the results for the friction coefficient @xmath17 which have been obtained on this basis ; we also indicate why this approach might be questioned , when applied to a system that is not maintained in exact thermal equilibrium .",
    "sections  [ lase]-[renorm ] develop a strategy for tackling the problem in non - equilibrium scalar field theory , exhibiting the sequence of approximations necessary to obtain a local equation of motion of the form ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "we find that this local equation of motion contains coefficients whose values must be found from the solution of auxiliary kinetic equations .",
    "the resulting set of local evolution equations is suitable for a numerical solution .",
    "however , we investigate in section  [ friction ] whether an adiabatic treatment of these evolution equations leads to a well defined friction coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "we find that it does not , and section  [ numeric ] exhibits numerical evidence that non - equilibrium effects may be quantitatively quite significant .",
    "section  [ fermions ] briefly discusses frictional effects due to fermions , showing that the formal situation is quite similar to that developed in detail for scalar fields .",
    "finally , our principal conclusions are summarized in section  [ discuss ] , where we also discuss the extent to which they depend on the methods of approximation we have utilized .",
    "roughly speaking , we can identify two mechanisms through which energy may be transferred between the classical field @xmath18 and the system of @xmath16 particles .",
    "one is the creation of new particles , which we will refer to as type - i . the other , to which we refer as type - ii , involves changing the energies of particles that are already present .",

    "this is a secondary effect , brought about by the fact that a change in @xmath49 alters the scattering and decay rates of @xmath16 particles , and hence affects the evolution of the occupation numbers @xmath45 .",

    "it is necessary to suppose that over a sufficiently long period of time , the classical field @xmath8 can be decomposed as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is constant and @xmath71 is small .",
    "correspondingly , the hamiltonian for @xmath16 will be decomposed as @xmath72 the second term being treated as a perturbation . to linear order in this perturbation ,",
    "the standard kubo formalism then yields @xmath73\\rangle^{\\mathrm{eq}}\\label{linres}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 denotes the thermal average in the equilibrium ensemble determined by @xmath75 .",
    "although @xmath75 has no explicit time dependence , it still contains interactions , and the remaining thermal averages can be computed systematically in perturbation theory . to obtain a well - defined answer for the linear response term in ( [ linres ] ) , it proves necessary to effect a partial resummation of the @xmath16 propagator , in particular identifying the thermal width @xmath76 as the imaginary part of a suitable self - energy ( as discussed in more detail below ) . as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the net result is a contribution to the equation of motion ( [ phieom ] ) of the form @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , provided that @xmath79 and that @xmath45 in ( [ etai ] ) and @xmath80 in ( [ etaii ] ) are identified as the constant equilibrium distribution associated with @xmath75 . as in the previous calculations , it is also necessary to assume that @xmath81 varies slowly on a time scale of order @xmath64 and can be approximated as @xmath82 .",
    "each of the calculations outlined above has its own deficiencies .",
    "the type - i analysis of section [ typei ] is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium , but treats interactions in an incomplete and _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "the type - ii analysis of section [ typeii ] is explicitly restricted to states very close to local equilibrium and rests on a kinetic equation which is little more than a guess .",
    "the linear response treatment of section [ lrt ] is much more systematic , insofar as the expectation value in ( [ linres ] ) can in principle be evaluated at any desired order of equilibrium perturbation theory .",
    "however , this calculation depends in an essential way on analytic properties of thermal green functions that are meaningful only in a state of exact thermal equilibrium .",
    "specifically , the wightman functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 have fourier transforms which satisfy the kms condition @xmath85 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in a state which departs even slightly from thermal equilibrium , neither the temporal fourier transform nor the kms condition",
    "has any meaning .",
    "the primary question addressed in the remainder of this paper is whether the apparently plausible result of linear response theory is recovered , for a non - equilibrium system , in the limit of slow time evolution .",
    "this will be possible , at best , only if we have a local approximation to expectation values such as @xmath86 , which are inherently nonlocal in time ( as evidenced by ( [ linres ] ) even in the linear response approximation ) , and devising such an approximation is the key feature of the analysis that follows .",
    "an important issue that is not addressed in this paper arises from the expression ( [ etaii ] ) .",
    "this contribution to the friction coefficient depends inversely on the thermal width @xmath76 , which is typically of the order of the square of a coupling constant , and appears to call into question the reliability of perturbation theory as applied to this problem .",
    "in fact , this is typical of expressions obtained in the application of linear response theory to the estimation of transport coefficients , and it is known that infinite classes of diagrams contribute at each order of perturbation theory @xcite . how the requisite resummation might be effected for a nonequilibrium system",

    "this additional time dependence modifies evolution equations in a way that may be cosmologically important . however , its net effect on , say , equations ( [ deltanueqn ] ) and ( [ deltaneqn ] ) is just that the right - hand sides of these equation contain terms proportional to @xmath307 in addition to those proportional to @xmath240 .",
    "these induce additional contributions to @xmath264 and @xmath263 , but do not affect our conclusions concerning the terms proportional to @xmath240 ."

    "<S> the methods of non - equilibrium quantum field theory are used to investigate the possibility of representing dissipation in the equation of motion for the expectation value of a scalar field by a friction term , such as is commonly included in phenomenological inflaton equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> a sequence of approximations is exhibited which reduces the non - equilibrium theory to a set of local evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the adiabatic solution to these evolution equations which is needed to obtain a local equation of motion for the expectation value is not well defined ; nor , therefore , is the friction coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a non - equilibrium treatment is essential , even for a system that remains close to thermal equilibrium , and the formalism developed here provides one means of achieving this numerically . </S>"
