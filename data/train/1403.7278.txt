    "motivated by the advent of string theory and the endeavor to solve fundamental problems in physics such as dark energy and cosmological constant problem , studying physics in higher dimensional spacetime has become a norm rather than exception .",
    "casimir effect @xcite which was proposed more than 60 years ago plays an important role in high energy physics since it is intimately related to the one - loop effective action of a quantum field @xcite .",
    "although most of the works in casimir effect were focused in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime , there have been quite a considerable amount of work on casimir effect in higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "one of the pioneering works is the work @xcite where the casimir effect of a @xmath9-dimensional rectangular cavity is studied .",
    "subsequently , casimir effect of a @xmath9-dimensional spherical cavity were also considered @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in contrast to the casimir interaction between two parallel plates considered by casimir in his pioneering work @xcite , the casimir energy of a @xmath9-dimensional rectangular or spherical cavity is a self - energy rather than interaction energy .    in the end of last century",
    ", it has gradually been realized that the casimir interaction between two objects should play a more important role since this is physically observable .",
    "partly also due to the need to compare to casimir experiments , researchers have started to research on the method to compute the casimir interactions between two objects , in particular between a sphere and a plate . in the early phase of this research ,",
    "most of the methods proposed were numerical @xcite .",
    "about eight years ago , new light has been shed on this problem by two new developments .",
    "first , gies and collaborators @xcite used worldline representation to compute the casimir interaction between two objects imposed with dirichlet boundary conditions . later a few groups of researchers @xcite independently developed some methods to compute functional representations for the casimir interaction between specific pairs of objects which all used the idea of multiple scattering in some form . in a time span of three years",
    ", a scheme has been worked out which in principle can be used to compute the casimir interactions between any two objects @xcite .",
    "motivated by the mode summation approach proposed for the cylinder - cylinder configuration @xcite , we managed to interpret the scheme proposed in @xcite from the point of view of mode summation approach @xcite . despite that we only considered examples in @xmath10-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "it is quite easy to see that the mathematical scheme we deployed in @xcite is not limited to @xmath10-dimensional spacetime .",
    "there have been quite a number of works on the casimir effect between two parallel plates in higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the case of @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime has been treated in @xcite as limiting case of rectangular cavity . as a first step to consider casimir interaction between nontrivial objects in higher dimensional spacetime , we have considered the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider two spheres with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "this scenario is more interesting since it can be used to model two spherical objects in the universe .",
    "the mathematical scheme we developed in @xcite is used to compute the casimir interaction energy . in hyper - spherical coordinates",
    ", it is easy to write down the scattering matrices of the two spheres .",
    "the most technical part of the problem is to derive the translation matrices which relate the hyper - spherical coordinate system centered at the two spheres . for this",
    ", we generalize the operator approach developed for the @xmath1 case @xcite .",
    "a major difference is that we do not use @xmath2-symbols to rewrite the translation matrices as linear combinations of spherical waves but leave it as integrals over gegenbauer polynomials .    after deriving the functional representation for the casimir interaction energy ,",
    "a natural question to ask is what we can infer from the formula .",
    "one of the most important things we want to know is the strength of the interaction .",
    "to have an idea of this , we need to compute the asymptotic expansions of the casimir interaction energy at small and large separations .",
    "the computation of the large separation asymptotic behavior is quite straightforward since it only involves a few terms which can be computed explicitly .",
    "for the small separation asymptotic expansion , the computations are more complicated and a careful order counting is needed . for @xmath1 case , such analysis have been carried out in @xcite for different configurations .",
    "our current scenario is closest to @xcite where two spheres in @xmath10-dimensional spacetime is considered .",
    "however , a major difference is that we do not have @xmath2-symbols in the formula for the casimir interaction energy .",
    "so instead of the integral representation for the @xmath2-symbols , we have to use an integral representation for the gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "it turns out that this is in fact not any more complicated .",
    "this work will shed some light on how to compute the casimir effect between two objects with nontrivial geometry in higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "it will also be interesting for researchers wanted to study quantum system of two spherical objects in higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "in this section , we consider the casimir interaction energy between two spheres in @xmath0-dimensional minkowski spacetime equipped with the standard metric @xmath11 the equation of motion of a scalar field @xmath12 is @xmath13    assume that the radii of the spheres are @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , and the centers are at @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",

    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath33 the solutions of this differential equation are parametrized by @xmath34 , with @xmath35the regular and outgoing spherical waves are @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38@xmath39 and @xmath40 are bessel functions , and @xmath41 is a gegenbauer polynomial defined by @xmath42 the gegenbauer polynomials satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath43 hence , the hyperspherical harmonics @xmath44 satisfy the orthogonality condition @xmath45 where @xmath46 the constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined by @xmath49 so that @xmath50    in @xcite , we have discussed the mathematical formalism underlying the tgtg formula for the casimir interaction energy @xmath51 between two objects .",

    "it can be applied for casimir interaction in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime .",
