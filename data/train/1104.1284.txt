    "a time step restriction is always necessary for time dependent calculations in computational fluid dynamics .",
    "currently , such restrictions are needed for mathematical stability reasons in explicit calculations of partial differential equations ( pde ) , while they are necessary for accuracy considerations in implicit calculations . the integrated physical local property at time step level @xmath0 : @xmath1 is a function of its previous values at time steps @xmath2 , @xmath3 etc .",
    ", as well as of spatial derivatives of its spatial flux densities : @xmath4 , relative to the previous time steps for explicit calculations .",
    "instead @xmath1 is a function of these quantities also for the same @xmath0 time step level for implicit calculations .    for explicit calculations of the computational flow , the courant - friedrichs - lewy condition @xcite",
    "is imposed on those hyperbolic terms representing advection in pde ( spatial derivatives of pressure or velocity ) , where the given courant number @xmath5 is generally of the order of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spatial resolution , @xmath8 is the maximum value between the local kinematic and the signal transmission velocities within the entire computational domain , and @xmath9 is the courant - friedrichs - lewy time step to be computed .",
    "explicit integration techniques are widely adopted to solve equations of the fluid dynamics both in the eulerian formalism , where time and space derivatives refer both to local derivatives of the physical properties ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , according to the adopted spatial resolution length , and in the lagrangian formalism , where the material or the convective derivative @xmath12 characterizes the flow description @xcite .",
    "although the scientific literature is quite rich as for the implicit numerical integrations of pde , implicit backward difference methods are also shown for ordinary differential equations ( ode ) working with lagrangian derivatives @xcite . in spite of such a dichotomy @xcite produced an implicit lagrangian method , based on a triangular mesh for calculations of non stationary astrophysical processes , whose results successfully compare with other lagrangian explicit calculations , although some details in the flow do not compare with those obtained via eulerian formalism . in semi - lagrangian techniques ,",
    "the basic idea is to discretize the lagrangian derivative of the solution in time instead of the eulerian derivative . despite the full lagrangian nature of the technique ,",
    "a spatial grid is necessarily considered .",
    "values of physical quantities of the system of differential equations are calculated through spatial interpolations at the grid points .",
    "explicit - implicit integration techniques involve these spatial grid points and particle positions at previous time levels .",
    "semi - lagrangian schemes @xcite have been built up based on mixed explicit - implicit schemes , increasing the time step up to a factor of @xmath13 , paying a little additional cost in the time computing , with a limited degradation in the accuracy of solutions .",
    "however , the evaluation of the maximum stable time step still remains debated because a time step lengthening of a factor of @xmath13 appears much shorter than seems necessary from considerations of accuracy @xcite .",
    "these works of the 70 s - 80 s were developed in metereology for numerical weather forecasts , where the use of a longer time step is essential for efficiency .",
    "2d and 3d applications of integrations in semi - lagrangian approach have been discussed in @xcite following a hierarchy of cases .",
    "the extension of semi - lagrangian method to the solution of viscous navier - stokes equations was done by @xcite , showing the nonlinear stability of the integration method , even as the viscosity decreases to zero , also showing an estimate of errors , later improved by @xcite .    currently , sph hydrodynamics works adopting an explicit integration technique , being sph a `` free lagrangian particle scheme '' @xcite .",
    "recently some authors @xcite developed implicit integration schemes working in sph to solve some selected problems dealing with the radiative transfer or with the heat transfer in the flow , adopting either the crank - nicolson , or the runge - kutta - fehlberg numerical integrations , or the conjugate gradient method .",
    "the adoption of such methods involves the handling of some time - expensive and memory consuming jacobian matrices .",
    "alternatively @xcite , some iterative variational techniques are also used to find zeros for the analytical equation coming out from the energy equation written in finite terms and including the diffusive terms , within an assigned tolerance error , setting the `` left '' and `` right '' boundary values for the thermal energy per unit mass @xmath14 , finding the median value using the van wijingarden - dekker - brent bisection method @xcite .",
    "however , the introduction of such mixed procedures involves deviations from the original pure particle hydrodynamics .",
    "in this paper we present a simple implicit mathematical technique able to perform semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integrations both of the euler and of the navier - stokes equations of the fluid dynamics , respecting the sph , or the sph - derived schemes , without any jacobian matrix handling .    the implicit integration procedure in our scheme is naturally based on an iterative integration scheme . however , we pay attention to the solution of the entire system of equations for all sph particles at the same time instant without using interpolation techniques like other semi - lagrangian schemes need @xcite , limiting the procedure to the implicit solution of a single advection equation even in 3d @xcite .",
    "instead , we use sph interpolations to perform implicit iterative integrations on the entire system of equations for all sph particles within the computational domain .",
    "an implicit integration scheme promises to be more efficient in some situations , for example when large bulk velocities are present , or when a system is close to hydrostatic equilibrium , or for very low mach number flows , for string diffusion , or for stiff source terms , etc .. in such cases the courant - friedrichs - lewy time step constraint that needs to be obeyed in explicit time integration schemes can be very restrictive , and may yield an explicit time step much shorter than in principle needed to follow the real dynamics of the system .",
    "the next sections of this work show how a semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit technique can be applied to sph .",
    "to do this , we briefly recall how sph works in  2 .",
    "then , we show how implicit integrations schemes work , how the lagrangian euler or navier - stokes equations have to be rewritten , how they are translated in the finite - difference schemes and how a suitable implicit time step advancement well beyond the courant - friedrichs - lewy limit is chosen (  3 ) .",
    "successful applications are here also reported for the case of 1d and 2d blast waves sph modelling , as well as for the 2d gas shockless radial viscous transport (  4 ) .",
    "finally , astrophysical applications are here also presented (  5 ) on the study of a 3d an accretion disc around a mbh in a microquasar , both adopting the implicit and the explicit integration procedures . some advantages and some disadvantages of the implicit techniques , compared with the explicit schemes",
    "are also discussed .",
    "both explicit and implicit accuracies , applied to sph , are also discussed .    in a physically viscous accretion process onto a mbh in a microquasar , the viscous conversion of mechanical energy into heat decreases the mach number to values so low that the cfl explicit time step could be too short for practical purposes .",

    "sometimes these terms are absent and sometimes they are present , according the simulation we are considering . here they are written only for universality reasons .    the sph method is a free lagrangian scheme @xcite that discretizes the fluid into moving interacting and interpolating domains called `` particles '' @xcite .",
    "all particles move according to pressure and body forces .",
    "the method makes use of a kernel @xmath29 useful to smoothing interpolate a physical quantity @xmath30 related to a gas particle at position @xmath31 according to :    @xmath32    @xmath33 , the interpolation kernel , is a continuous function - or two connecting continuously differentiable functions even at the connecting point - defined in the spatial range @xmath34 , whose limit for @xmath35 is the dirac delta distribution function .",

    ", the fluid quantity @xmath44 at the position of each sph particle could be interpreted by filtering the particle data for @xmath46 with a single windowing function whose width is @xmath47 .",
    "so doing , fluid data are considered isotropically smoothed all around each particle along a length scale @xmath47 . therefore , according to these two concepts , the sph value of the physical quantity @xmath44 is both the overlapping of extended profiles of all particles and the overlapping of the closest smooth density profiles of @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the compactness of the kernel shape gives the principal contribution to the interpolation summation to each particle by itself and by its closest neighbours .",
    "in both approaches the mass is globally conserved in so far as the total particle number is constant .    in sph formalism ,",

    "to apply either the adams - bashforth or the adams - moulton techniques , up to the wished precision , previous derivatives for the same flow elements need to be conserved .",
    "besides , a further evaluator procedure is considered at the end of the predictor - corrector integration scheme , to be a pece ( not a pec ) technique .",
    "what has been discussed is necessary to understand how it is possible to build up a semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit technique for sph . in our semi - lagrangian",
    "explicit - implicit sph integration approach , the first explicit integration scheme is necessarily the same that we currently use ( leapfrog , adams - bashforth - moulton schemes , etc . ) , without strictly taking into account of the courant - friedrichs - lewy limit for the time step .",
    "the adoption of an explicit - implicit backward and forward procedure has also been used by some others @xcite , although some recent pure implicit schemes exist @xcite , under some strict conditions .",
    "we use indifferently either a leapfrog or an adams - bashforth - moulton scheme as explicit procedure to calculate integrated values to the time level @xmath0 for all sph particles .",
    "then , we can use iteratively the expression ( 26 ) to repeat , only implicitly , integrations adopting @xmath126 and @xmath125 , without any mathematical operation of jacobian matrix inversion .",
    "the total number of implicit iterations is of course arbitrary .",
    "the first explicit integration step in the semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit technique works only once at the 1st iteration . from the 2nd iteration onward ,",
    "the entire integration process is fully implicit .",
    "however , @xmath140 or @xmath141 implicit iterations at most are usually enough to get a convergence ( even better in sph ) because the variation between the implicit solution and the previous solution in the iterative integration procedure quickly reduces toward very small relative differences @xmath142 ( being @xmath143 , avoiding any divergence in the solution @xcite .",
    "notice that these relative differences refer to relative variations of the generic integrated physical quantity @xmath144 by the progression of iterative calculations of computed integrals , not to relative errors in the implicit integrations .",
    "relative errors refer to relative discrepancies from the exact analytical solution , if it is known , or to general aspects referred to the entire flow through conservation laws .",
    "a number of implicit iterations larger than @xmath141 is of course possible , but practicable in so far as the implicit iteration technique is competitive against the current explicit integration methods . on the contrary ,",
    "not only results would be less accurate , but also the entire procedure would be more time consuming . in this sense , the semi - lagrangian schemes of @xcite , whose method works for a time lengthening up to a factor of @xmath13 , should be not convenient if implicit iterations are more than @xmath145 .",
    "a quick convergence of numerical results in sph is ensured by the fact that dissipation ( even artificial ) always works since the first explicit time step of the iterative cycle so that solutions normally relax without any oscillation or with very small damped oscillations . a larger number of iterations also produces a cumulative effect both on dissipation and on numerical errors , cycle by cycle , which is normally a not wished result .",
    "a control on the solution accuracy is normally possible in so far as only one sph equation is implicitly integrated ( as some authors do only for the energy equation ) .",
    "but , this is practically impossible when solving implicitly the entire system of equations , because how to control at the same time so many semi - lagrangian solutions as many are the scalar equations for a multitude of grid points is not treated in the mathematical literature , without any warranty for an improvement on other solutions . as an example",
    ", it could be possible that the implicit solution for the density for one sph particle satisfies the arbitrary criterion that its relative variation is limited within the assigned tolerance as @xmath146 after @xmath141 implicit iterative cycles , but at the same time that the other relative variations for @xmath147 , @xmath148 , etc .",
    "still do not because they are greater than the established tolerance .",
    "the iterative cycle could either terminate , accepting the relative variations as they are at the moment , or it could continue .",
    "but each further cycle will destroy the consistency of the solution for the density which relaxes toward its numerical value within @xmath141 cycles of implicit iterations . from the 4th implicit cycle ahead the solution for @xmath22 could loose accuracy more and more .",
    "even though normally a local instability affecting one solution ( explicit or implicit ) also affects other integrated solutions , situations where discrepancies occur in the relative variations can not be excluded .",
    "these difficulties normally increase as longer is @xmath149 compared with @xmath9 because of both error and dissipation accumulation .",
    "whenever @xmath150 , the degradation in the accuracy is normally negligible @xcite , but for larger time ratios it is not .",
    "this means that , especially for @xmath151 , the number of iterations in the implicit procedure can not be too low because the solution could be affected by the instabilities coming from the first explicit integration , but also it means at the same time that the number of iterations can not be too high because of the long time lost and because of the inaccuracy corruption on the solution . a relaxation in the sph solution normally happens .",
    "the density of energy @xmath152 or the density of enthalpy @xmath153 include all physical quantities @xmath22 , @xmath135 , @xmath14 , however , the propagation of relative discrepancies @xmath142 for both @xmath22 , @xmath14 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 can not be managed cycle by cycle .",
    "what is here discussed clearly shows that the argument of solution consistency for a system of equations is quite complex for only one particle .",
    "however each iterative cycle of implicit integrations needs to involve a multitude of sph particles at the same time .",
    "relative variation for energy or enthalpy densities for the totality of particles as @xmath157 or as @xmath158 an arbitrary tolerance ( e.g. @xmath159 ) is a valid general criterion for the evaluation of the consistency of the implicit integrated solutions at the same time level @xmath0 between two consecutive integration cycles .",
    "these global conditions do not ensure the consistency of local implicit solutions for the single particle even for explicit integrations within the cfl condition .",
    "this , in particular happens whenever free edges of the flow are considered , without any dirichlet or von neuman boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , two different sph particles could have very different values for @xmath160 or for @xmath161 , especially at the free edge of the computational domain .",
    "hence , even if this global criterion is not satisfied at the 4th iterative cycle ( @xmath26 explicit plus @xmath141 implicit ) , we decide to interrupt implicit iterations , proceeding to the next time step .",
    "thus we privilege the criterion that the integration for each implicit iteration can not exceed the 4th cycle ( the third implicit cycle ) , otherwise the whole implicit scheme would be not competitive compared with the explicit integrations , because too time consuming . since this paper is a study on the application of a semi - lagrangian integration technique to sph , even the same comparison with sph explicit integration solution should answer to the question whether the semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integration consistency of solutions is acceptable or not",
    "our semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integration technique on sph costs about @xmath162 more time for each iterative implicit cycle ( from the 2nd cycle onward ) compared with a simple leapfrog explicit scheme as used in sph .",
    "this is due to the fact that the most expensive calculation is that relative only to the sph interpolations of the two ends of each spatial stencil at time level @xmath163 on the @xmath40th particle , fortunately restricted only to the same known local neighbours .",
    "this means that it is not necessary further computational time in searching for neighbours to the @xmath40th particle . at the same time",
    ", it is also necessary a limitation of the implicit dissipation accumulation .",
    "truncation errors consist , typically , of successive higher even and odd ordered derivatives @xcite acting as a dissipation on the integrated solution . therefore , each implicit iteration yields a solution including a dissipation , involving further stability , but also a larger inaccuracy , as it is normal for implicit integration calculations .",
    "it is normal that the implicit integrations are anyway less accurate than the explicit ones .",
    "however a much shorter duration of calculations should well compensate this disadvantage if consistency of solutions is satisfactory .",
    "notice that in expression ( 26 ) while the @xmath164 subscript indicates the component of a vector determined by the orthogonal projection , the @xmath118 subscript is an index of position along a 1d spatial mesh at time ( @xmath0 ) , where sph interpolation are needed .",
    "we adopt this scheme in 3d along three arbitrary distinct orthogonal axes ( e.g. axes parallel to the @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 directions ) , assuming that the real sph particle stays at the centre of the spatial - temporal ( @xmath118 , @xmath0 ) 1d line parallel to the chosen arbitrary axis , time by time ( fig .",
    "1 ) , whose spatial grid index @xmath118 runs along it .",
    "the grid index @xmath118 identifies the ith particle along the 1d computational arbitrary spatial line ( here @xmath168 , or @xmath167 ) in 3lfi .",
    "indexes @xmath169 and @xmath170 refer to the interpolation spatial points `` ahead '' and `` behind '' the same ith sph particle along such an axis .",
    "the necessity of as many orthogonal axes as many are the dimensions of the flow is necessary to solve discontinuities in the flow whenever they are not simple linear fronts .",
    "so doing , we assume that both the eulerian and the lagrangian spatial derivatives are expressed in the same fashion in the finite differences scheme and that the correspondence between the temporal lagrangian derivative @xmath21 and its corresponding terms in the first row of eq .",

    "the reference frame is centred on the primary compact star , whose rotational period , normalized to @xmath334 , coincides with the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "this explains why in the momentum equation ( eq .",
    "2 ) , we also include the coriolis and the centrifugal accelerations .",
    "pressure , density , temperature and velocity are six unknowns to be found .",
    "therefore we solve the continuity , momentum , energy , and eos equations . in order to make our equations dimensionless",
    ", we adopt the following normalization factors : @xmath335 for masses , @xmath336 for lengths , @xmath337 for speeds , so that the orbital period is normalized to @xmath334 , @xmath338 for the density , @xmath339 for pressure , @xmath340 for thermal energy per unit mass and @xmath341 for temperature , where @xmath342 is the proton mass and @xmath343 is the boltzman constant .",
    "the adopted kernel smoothing resolution length is @xmath344 throughout .",
    "the geometric domain , including disc particles , is a sphere of radius @xmath26 , centred on the primary mbh .",
    "the rotating reference frame is centred on the compact primary and its rotational period equals the orbital one .",
    "we simulated the physical conditions at the inner and at the outer edges as follows :    \\a ) inner edge : + the free inflow condition is realized by eliminating particles flowing inside the sphere of radius @xmath345 , centred on the mbh .",
    "although disc structure and dynamics are altered near the inner edge , these alterations are relatively small because they are balanced by a high particle concentration close to the inner edge in supersonic injection models .",
    "\\b ) outer edge : + the injection of `` new '' particles from l1 toward the interior of the primary roche lobe is simulated by generating them in fixed points , called `` injectors '' , symmetrically placed within an angle having l1 as a vertex and an aperture of @xmath346 .",
    "normally , as adopted since our first paper on sph accretion disc in cb @xcite , the radial elongation of the whole group of injectors is @xmath347 .",
    "the initial injection particle velocity is radial with respect to l1 . in order to simulate a constant and smooth gas injection ,",
    "a `` new '' particle is generated in the injectors whenever `` old '' particles leave an injector free , inside a small sphere with radius @xmath47 , centred on the injector itself .",
    "particle masses are determined by the assumed local density at the inner lagrangian point l1 : @xmath348 ( as typical stellar atmospheric value for the secondary star ) , equal to @xmath349 .",
    "the adoption of supersonic mass transfer conditions from l1 is fully discussed in @xcite , where disc instabilities , responsible for disc active phases of cb are discussed in the light of local thermodynamics .",
    "whenever a relevant discrepancy exists in the mass density across the inner lagrangian point l1 between the two stellar roche lobes , a supersonic mass transfer occurs as a consequence of the momentum flux conservation . the same result can also be obtained @xcite by considering either the restricted problem of three bodies in terms of the jacobi constant or the bernoulli s theorem .",
    "moreover , and this is the most important thing , we need to compare 3d disc models where @xmath255 and @xmath256 could be significantly different . this condition is searched for since the injection conditions at l1 , favouring violent collisions among low compressibility ( @xmath326 ) particles moving around a mbh , rising up particle heating at expense of the kinetic + gravitational energies .",
    "these conditions make much smaller the thermal contribution in @xmath255 evaluation compared with the kinetic contribution throughout the disc , especially when viscous heating or other forms of heating are considered .",
    "thus when @xmath350 , a significant deviation in the implicit solutions would affect the whole result , up to compromising the numerical stability .",
    "a sensible reduction in @xmath255 even happens whenever other forms of signal transmission velocity ( e.g. the alfn speed ) are also taken into account .",
    "this makes the inner disc region , at its inner edge , quite critical for a low compressibility highly viscous accretion disc around a mbh , because all these characteristics contribute to a sharp decrease of the explicit @xmath255 . in particular a supersonic mass viscous flow transfer at l@xmath351 and a central mbh determine an initial mechanical energy large eonugh to be converted into heat with high @xmath25 to yield very low mach numbers at the disc inner edge .    the first viscosity coefficient ( eq .",
    "10 ) in the viscous disc models is related to the shakura and sunyaev parametrization @xcite as : @xmath352 , being @xmath353 the local disc thickness .",
    "the second viscosity coefficient , related to the bulk viscosity is not taken into account for the sake of simplicity .",
    "two viscous disc models are considered , whose @xmath354 and whose @xmath322 .",
    "these values are in accordance with the typical and with the maximum @xmath355 compatible with both astrophysical observations @xcite and with laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "these disc models are also compared with the non viscous disc model counterpart , taken as a reference model .",
    "figg . 8 and 9",
    "show three xy and xz plots of the injected stream from l1 at time @xmath356 for the three disc models . the greater compactness of the injected flow of particles is visible with the increase of the viscosity parameter as a result of the sticking viscous effect .",
    "the large stream geometric spread is mainly due to the low compressibility here adopted ( @xmath326 ) , while the wide initial circularization radius is explained by the high angular momentum at l1 of the injected flow .",
    "these initial kinematic conditions affect the whole disc structure and kinematics throughout the simulations .",
    "indeed , the injected gas stream yields an impenetrable boundary of the outer disc edge itself and a significant fraction of the disc s ejection flow comes from this side of the outer disc edge . besides , a wide spray of direct cold injected flow above and below the mean disc plane also plays a role .    figs .",
    "10 , 11 and 12 show a comparison of explicit and implicit sph disc structures for the non viscous and the viscous models whose @xmath354 and @xmath357 , respectively .",
    "all explicit and implicit structures impressively compare with each other , as well as their injection , ejection and accretion rates , whose values are in the order of @xmath358 , @xmath359 and @xmath360 , respectively for the inviscid disc models , of @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 , respectively for the @xmath354 viscid disc models , of @xmath364 , @xmath365 and @xmath366 , respectively for the @xmath322 viscid disc models .",
    "some limited differences appear in the comparison between the implicit to the explicit disc structures in figg .",
    "10 and 11 , due to the fact that the implicit structures suffer of a relative additional intrinsic viscosity , because of the cumulation of numerical dissipations in the implicit integration iterative procedure .",
    "these differences are reduced and become negligible in the physically more viscous disc structure of fig .",
    "12 , where both the explicit and the implicit disc structures better compare with each other . in this case",
    "the higher physical viscosity makes secondary the effect of other artificial and intrinsic numerical dissipations .",
    "the total number of disc particles are of the order of @xmath367 , @xmath368 and @xmath369 particles , respectively in steady state conditions when the mass of the disc is statistically unchanged for explicit calculations after @xmath370 , @xmath371 and @xmath372 time steps for @xmath373 , @xmath374 and @xmath357 , respectively .",
    "instead , for implicit calculations , we count @xmath375 , @xmath376 and @xmath377 particles , respectively after @xmath378 , @xmath379 and @xmath380 time steps , respectively for the same @xmath355 .",
    "as it is evident , the total number of particles compare with each other for the same @xmath355 characterizing the disc model , but the total number of time steps for implicit integrations is clearly much less than that relative to explicit integrations .",
    "the durations of each integration process for the implicit scheme is of course longer taking into account of the iterative cycles .",
    "the total number of disc particles for implicit integration schemes are about @xmath381 systematically lower than those relative to explicit integration schemes .",
    "of course these are very little difference among explicit - implicit results .",
    "this result is explained by the fact that , being the mass transfer process from l1 a discrete process simulated by a particle generation , the longer implicit time step involves a mass transfer rate about @xmath382 slower in the implicit cases .",
    "consequently , also the accretion and the ejection rates for implicit integration disc modelling are proportionally lower than those relative to the explicit integration disc models .",
    "being these differences so tiny , they are not detectable by the direct counting of particles on short or on medium size time intervals , refereed to the orbital period",
    ". however , this very little difference in the injection , ejection , accretion rates , does not involve consistent differences among the explicit - implicit disc structures and dynamics , whose azimuthal and radial profile of density look like very similar , a part some graphical contrast effects in the grey tones .    even though disc models refer to a low compressibility regime ( @xmath326 )",
    ", the primary s mbh roche lobe is large and deep enough to favour a disc consistency even in the non viscous disc model .",
    "this is a first result , different from those relative to low mass binaries , where sph models yield scarcely populated low compressibility non viscous structures @xcite .",
    "although finalized to a different strategy , a statistically significant 2d structure of the disc around a mbh were obtained by @xcite .    the collisional push exerted by the flow coming from l1 on the outer edge of the disc yields an effective perturbation generating a global disc s elliptic geometry in the viscous cases . as a consequence ,",
    "spiral density patterns characterize sph viscous disc models around mbh , as well depicted in figg .",
    "11 and 12 . instead",
    ", possible spiral patterns are not well resolved , or they do not well develop in the sph non viscous model because of the inadequacy of dissipation able to numerically resolve shock fronts in the low compressibility flow and because the stream flow from l1 is too sparse in order to exert an effective localized push at the disc s outer edge . in these two last figures in particular ,",
    "relative to the two physically viscous models , two main spiral patterns in the density are evident , even if the glimmer of the appearance of a third one is also shown .",
    "these facts are recorded in 3d modelling . on the contrary ,",
    "spiral structures around mbh , as well as spiral shocks in the disc s radial flow , are normally seen in the 2d non viscous low compressibility modelling @xcite . in the case of low mass close binaries , sph low compressibility viscous disc models are not able to show any spiral pattern because of several shortcomings in the method , especially when",
    "free edge conditions are considered @xcite .",
    "the better compactness of the entire elliptical viscous disc structure , not only yields disc s spiral density profiles , but contextually also a spiral radial flow kinematics . in these low compressibility viscous models ,",
    "this is a subsonic kinematics , as shown in figg .",
    "13 and 14 where a selection in the radial mach number is made",
    ". the tendency should be to produce spiral shocks which should appear either increasing the flow compressibility modelling ( decreasing @xmath25 ) @xcite , or altering the stellar mass ratio or the initial injection kinematics in order to simulate a mass transfer flow from l1 where the radial kinematics is more enhanced than the tangential one .",
    "the higher are the kinetic energy and the initial angular momentum , the better is the coming out of spiral structures and shocks @xcite .",
    "this is a consolidated result that has emerged for low mass binary systems .",
    "however , in the case of a microquasar , where the primary component is a mbh , a large initial angular momentum and large coriolis and centrifugal terms favour too much an initial tangential kinematics at the cost of the radial one .    a further comprehension of disc structure and kinematics is shown in figg .",
    "15 and 16 , where the radial distribution of the specific angular momentum and the radial distribution of temperature are respectively shown on a logarithmic scale for the explicit integration results only because those relative to the implicit integration process are substantially the same .",
    "two details come out from these pictures .",
    "the first one is that the inner disc regions are less populated of particles in the two viscous models .",
    "this effect , due to the enhanced radial viscous transport , makes the radial profile of these two distributions more `` flat '' compared with that relative to the non viscous distributions .",
    "the second particular that appear from these two pictures is that the slopes of the two radial distributions are lesser than @xmath383 and @xmath384 relative to the `` standard disc model '' .",
    "the temperature radial profile is even flat for a large portion of the external part of the discs .",
    "this result is a consequence of the wide geometric opening of the injected flow coming from l1 ( figg .",
    "8 - 9 ) , where colder and higher radial flow in the disc bulk mix with hotter flows transported from the disc outer edge toward the central accretor . as a consequence ,",
    "looking from the outer disc edge toward the centre of the disc , both the temperature radial increase and the specific angular momentum decrease are lower than @xmath384 and @xmath383 laws , even though the viscous heating effect in the disc bulk and in its inner regions is remarkable especially for the @xmath322 .    from the pure numerical point of view , the so tight correspondence among explicit and implicit disc structures means that the radial viscous transport mechanisms are comparable despite the higher accumulation of dissipation and error propagation during the implicit integration iterative cycles .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the integrated effect of dissipation , distributed on a @xmath149 up to @xmath385 times longer than @xmath255 accumulated on @xmath386 cycles corresponds to that relative to explicit integrations distributed on the same time interval ( @xmath387 , where @xmath388 ) .",
    "this non trivial numerical conclusion confirms that , at least for sph , the chosen criterion for the number of iterative cycles works well .",
    "from the numerical point of view , a successful semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integration numerical scheme is here applied for the sph method that is a free lagrangian scheme @xcite .",
    "comparison to results obtained working with explicit numerical schemes shows an impressive convergence of results .",
    "traditionally , numerical schemes in such explicit - implicit approaches are stable and show a convergence when the adopted implicit time step is larger than the explicit one by up to @xmath13 times @xcite . in this study , correlating our implicit time @xmath149 stepping to the explicit time stepping @xmath255 and to the kinematic time stepping @xmath256 , we report consistent and stable results both for some 1d and 2d critical tests involving shocks and shockless physically radial viscous transport , as well as for 3d low compressibility accretion disc models around a mbh in a microquasar .",
    "this choice , in particular for the viscous modelling is motivated to stress the validity of the implicit technique we described .",
    "consistency of results is recorded up to @xmath389 as shown in fig .",
    "17 for the @xmath322 physically viscous accretion disc modelling , where @xmath299 is reported as a function of time for the implicit results for the three simulated discs .",
    "this has the evident advantage that working in such an explicit - implicit scheme we can obtain meaningful results in a much shorter time than working adopting the sph explicit time stepping .",
    "in particular we yield implicit results for the @xmath354 and @xmath322 discs in two weeks of cpu time using a serial code on a system based on an amd opteron cpu instead of times of the order of 5 months on the same hardware working in explicit integration technique . compared with other implicit techniques , this technique , working with a larger time computational step than the @xmath255 ,",
    "is competitive in so far as the integrated numerical value is obtained in a few iterations , otherwise the time involved in a higher number of iterations makes the techniques not attractive .",
    "the constraint for our semi - lagrangian approach we propose is that the number of implicit iterations should be high enough to have stable solutions , but low enough to have accuracy with a moderate dissipation and not too time consuming .",
    "however , a fast convergence of the integrated numerical solution belongs to the sph philosophy because of the spatial smooth distribution of any physical property around each moving particle , where @xmath390 . at the same time ,",
    "the necessity to compute some further spatial gradients according to eqs .",
    "( 45 , 46 ) does not involve any further cpu time because these spatial gradients could be calculated contextually with other sph quantities during the explicit step described in  3.2 .",
    "on  3.2 we put an unanswered question on which implicit relaxed solution is obtained after numerous iterations especially when @xmath391 .",
    "this argument of pure numerical applied mathematics is worth to be the theme of a dedicated book on the stability and convergence of semi - lagrangian implicit numerical solutions of hyperbolic - parabolic systems of equations in fluid dynamics and is well beyond the scope of this paper , whose message is that for sph it is possible to calculate consistent semi - lagrangian implicit solutions even in the range @xmath391 working with @xmath386 iterative cycles ( the first one explicit ) .",
    "hence , these results further shift the limit of @xmath13 claimed by @xcite and still debated @xcite .    from the astrophysical point of view",
    ", a well - bound accretion disc appears in a microquasar even for a non viscous - low compressibility modelling .",
    "this is allowed because of the strong gravitational field of the central mbh prevailing on the repulsive pressure forces . in these low compressibility models",
    "the kinematic of the radial flow stays subsonic throughout even if the physical viscous contribution is also taken into account . for the physically viscous models , two main spiral patterns in the density flow clearly",
    "appear mainly as a consequence of the elliptical morphology of the entire disc structure and the disc s outer edge is better shaped .",
    "a possible third spiral profile can also appear .",
    "the radial disc structures all deviate from that of the disc standard model because of the vertical inflow of cold gas coming from l1 .",
    "the full consistency of the semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integration technique applied to free lagrangian methods is checked not only because of the technical tests here presented , but above all , because of the fully convergence of results between 3d sph explicit and explicit - implicit accretion disc modelling , where a complex of phenomenology , both viscous and inviscid , are here shown , especially when a strong gravitational field of a mbh deeply affect the local viscous thermodynamics producing a consistent difference between @xmath149 and @xmath255 .",
    "this beyond the correspondence between our disc modelling and a real existing astrophysical counterpart . around a mbh , some physics of viscous disc models is stressed so much to determine , especially at its inner edge those conditions decreasing the explicit @xmath255 to numerical values so small to stress out if a @xmath392 could yield to sph consistent solutions in a semi - lagrangian explicit - implicit integration .    a gravitational field ,",
    "even if dominant against pressure forces is necessary to check if for large @xmath249 the method correctly works .",
    "moreover , in a 3d problem , relevant gravitational forces could be dominant against pressure , viscosity ones , etc . , only along the radial direction .",
    "the opposite happens along the tangential and vertical directions .",
    "this as for the momentum equation only . in any case",
    ", the consistency of solutions should also take into account of the continuity and of the thermal energy equations not including any external field .",
    "since the complete solution must also take into account of these contributions , we deduce that the comparison of explicit and explicit - implicit solutions is a success of the new scheme .",
