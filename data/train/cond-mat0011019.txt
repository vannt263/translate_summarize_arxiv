    "the parent compounds of the high - transition - temperature ( high-@xmath8 ) copper - oxide superconductors are antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulators characterized by a simple doubling of the crystallographic unit cell in the cuo@xmath3 planes @xcite .",
    "when holes are doped into these planes , the long - range af - ordered phase is destroyed and the lamellar copper - oxide materials become metallic and superconducting .",
    "this raises the fundamental question of the role of the magnetism in the superconductivity of these materials . over the past decade ,",
    "experimental probes such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , muon spin resonance ( @xmath22sr ) , and neutron scattering have been used to address this fundamental question . in particular ,",
    "neutron scattering experiments have unambiguously shown the presence of short - range af spin correlations ( fluctuations ) in cuprate superconductors such as la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 @xcite and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite at all doping levels , @xmath6 .",
    "even so , the role of such fluctuations in the pairing mechanism and superconductivity is still a subject of controversy @xcite .    if spin fluctuations are important for the mechanism of high-@xmath8 superconductivity , they should be universal for all copper oxide systems .",
    "for the la@xmath3cuo@xmath17 family of materials , which has a single cuo@xmath3 layer per unit cell , superconductivity can be induced by the substitution of sr , ba , or ca for la or by intercalation of excess oxygen .",
    "the low - energy spin fluctuations have been observed at a quartet of incommensurate wave vectors ( fig .",
    "1 ) away from the af bragg positions , often referred to as @xmath23 , in the @xmath24 compounds @xcite .",
    "these modulated low - frequency spin fluctuations persist in both the normal and superconducting states with a suppression of their intensity below @xmath8 @xcite . as a function of the doping ,",
    "the incommensurability @xmath18 increases linearly with @xmath6 until saturating at @xmath25 for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the incommensurability depends only on the doping level and the unbound charge introduced by the dopants , and not on the method for introducing the charge @xcite . as a function of increasing frequency ,",
    "the incommensurability does not change @xcite , and no particularly sharp features have been identified @xcite . for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , which has two cuo@xmath3 planes per unit cell ( bilayer ) ,",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "early measurements @xcite have shown that the most prominent feature in the spin fluctuations spectra in the highly doped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) is a sharp peak which appears below @xmath8 at an energy of @xmath2841 mev . when scanned at fixed energy as a function of wave vector , the sharp peak",
    "is centered at @xmath29 and generally referred to as a resonance .",
    "for underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , the resonance also peaks at @xmath29 but with a reduced energy @xcite . in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath30",
    ", it occurs at 34 mev and is superposed on a continuum which is gapped at low energies @xcite .",
    "below the resonance frequency , the continuum is actually strongest at a quartet of incommensurate positions consistent with those in la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 of the same hole doping ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite .",
    "this discovery along with similar observations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath31 @xcite suggests that incommensurate spin fluctuations may be universal to all high-@xmath8 superconductors .    in this article ,",
    "we report systematic unpolarized and polarized inelastic neutron scattering studies of spin fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 . by carefully separating the magnetic signal from phonons and other spurious effects",
    ", we determine the wave vector and energy dependence of the spin dynamical susceptibility , @xmath0 , as a function of temperature and doping concentration .",
    "for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with oxygen concentrations at all doping levels addressed in this article , we observe a spin gap in the superconducting state , a commensurate resonance , and incommensurate spin fluctuations at energies below the resonance .",
    "the magnitude of the spin gap in the superconducting state ( @xmath7 ) is proportional to @xmath13 with @xmath9 .",
    "the resonance appears above @xmath8 for underdoped compounds but occurs exclusively below @xmath8 for optimal and overdoped materials .",
    "the incommensurability of the excitations below the resonance decreases with increasing energy until merging into the resonance . for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath21 ,",
    "the incommensurability is approximately proportional to @xmath8 . for oxygen concentrations @xmath6 above 0.6 ,",
    "the incommensurability is independent of hole - doping and saturates at @xmath32 . in the case of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath33 , the commensurate low - frequency normal state magnetic excitations centered around @xmath29",
    "are suppressed with the opening of a large spin gap in the superconducting state . for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath34 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath35 ,",
    "the normal state spin fluctuations are below the detection limit of current triple - axis spectroscopy , and the magnetic fluctuations in the superconducting state are dominated by the well - discussed resonance at @xmath36 mev @xcite and incommensurate spin fluctuations below the resonance .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "iiia , polarized and unpolarized neutron scattering data for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with oxygen concentrations , @xmath6 , of @xmath37 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.93 , and 0.95 are presented with a detailed description of the procedures used to extract magnetic scattering . in sec .",
    "iiib , a comparison of the results with those for la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 is presented .",
    "the issues of the doping dependence of the incommensurability , the spin gap in the superconducting state , the resonance in the normal state of underdoped materials , and resonance energy are addressed . finally , the results presented in this paper and recent magnetic field dependence measurements of the spin fluctuations are discussed with the predictions and consequences of various theoretical models .",
    "section iv gives a brief summary of the major conclusions of this work .",
    "the experiments were performed on large twined crystals of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 that were prepared by the melt - grown technique at the university of washington . as emphasized in previous publications @xcite ,",
    "these samples contain considerable amounts of y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 @xcite as an impurity .",
    "the structural and superconducting properties of these melt - grown yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 samples with different y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 concentrations have been studied in detail by gopalan _",
    "these authors found that the yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 platelet width and crack width decrease with increasing y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 content . the reduced average yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 grain width may facilitate the formation of equilibrium crystal structures at various oxygen concentrations . in a recent study of oxygen equilibration and chemical diffusion in massive yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 crystals , lindemer @xcite found that melt - grown samples containing a significant amount of y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 reached their equilibrium values of oxygen concentration in a dynamic flow of oxygen considerably faster than samples without this impurity .",
    "these results are consistent with the notion that oxygen invariant y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 , micro - cracks , and the boundaries between twin grains are important in providing oxygen pathways through these large samples of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .    for nonstoichiometric pure phase yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , lindemer and coworkers @xcite have established the thermodynamic equilibrium phase diagram of oxygen concentration versus temperature and oxygen pressure ( @xmath39-@xmath40 ) .",
    "we oxygenate yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 in a vacuum thermogravimetric apparatus ( tga ) by annealing to the equilibrium weight ( @xmath41 mg ) , equivalent to a sensitivity in @xmath42 of 0.0003 per mol , at @xmath39-@xmath40[o@xmath3 ] conditions for the desired oxygen doping following previously established models @xcite . instead of quenching the sample after annealing ,",
    "the partial pressure of oxygen in the tga was adjusted during the cooling process to maintain a constant sample mass , thus ensuring uniformity in oxygen content and an equilibrium crystal structure .",
    "seven single crystals of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 were oxygenated in this way to obtain @xmath6 of 0.45 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.93 , and 0.95 .",
    "the superconducting properties of these yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 crystals were characterized by a squid magnetometer .",
    "susceptibility measurements made on small pieces cut from these samples show superconducting transition temperatures of @xmath44 k , @xmath45 k , @xmath46 k , @xmath47 k , @xmath48 k , and @xmath49 k , for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath50 , yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath51 , yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath30 , yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath31 , yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath33 , and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the transition temperature for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath35 of 92 k is estimated from the temperature dependence of the resonance @xcite .",
    "although the widths of superconducting transition temperatures for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath52 are usually sharp ( @xmath53 k ) , the transition widths for lower doping samples are considerably broader .",
    "this appears to be the intrinsic property of the underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .    to quantitatively determine the effectiveness of this oxygenation technique and the composition of the melt - grown crystal",
    ", two pieces were cut from a 96-g sample of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath34 .",

    "sample @xmath55 weighed 14.98-g .",
    "powder diffraction measurements were performed on sample @xmath54 at room temperature using the hb-4 high - resolution powder diffractometer with an incident beam wavelength of 1.0314    at the high - flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) at oak ridge national laboratory @xcite .",
    "rietveld analysis of the powder data ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) revealed that the sample contains 83.6 mol% yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with the partial oxygen occupancies [ o(1 ) ] at @xmath58 and 16.4 mol% y@xmath3bacuo@xmath38 .",

    "sample @xmath55 was subjected to independent thermogravimetric analysis .",
    "the 14.98-g specimen ( @xmath55 ) was subjected to the de - oxygenation study in the tga .",
    "the weight change of @xmath55 relative to the room - temperature weight was measured after equilibration at 573 k and at successively higher temperatures .",
    "the results were converted to @xmath42 values and compared to the expected behavior @xcite .",
    "this analysis demonstrated that the initial oxygen content of @xmath55 was @xmath63 , thus confirming the effectiveness of our oxygenation technique .    in an unpublished work , chakoumakos and lindemer @xcite",

    "they performed rietveld analysis of the powder neutron diffraction data obtained on hb-4 for a series yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 samples and established the relationship between oxygen concentration and lattice parameters ( fig .",
    "high resolution measurements on the single crystals oxygenated in our study indicated that the lattice parameters have virtually the same value as powders . as a consequence",
    ", we used the lattice parameters established in their powder work for our single - crystal inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements were made at hfir using the hb-1 and hb-3 triple - axis spectrometers .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath64 is measured in units of @xmath65 and reciprocal space positions are specified in reciprocal lattice units ( rlu ) @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , and @xmath70 are the lattice parameters of the orthorhombic unit cell of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the magnetic neutron scattering directly measures the imaginary part of the generalized spin susceptibility @xmath0 for momentum transfer @xmath71 and energy transfer @xmath1 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the incident and final neutron wave vectors , respectively .",
    "the scattering cross - section for an isotropic system @xcite is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the lande factor ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath77 is @xmath78 cm , @xmath79 is the magnetic form factor , @xmath80=1/[1-exp(-\\hbar\\omega / k_bt)]$ ] is the bose population factor , and @xmath81 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the major difficulty in studying spin fluctuations in high-@xmath8 materials is to separate the magnetic scattering from ( single- and multi- ) phonon scattering and other spurious processes .",
    "while many spurious events such as accidental bragg scattering can be identified by performing the desired inelastic scan in the two - axis mode @xcite , two approaches are used to separate magnetic from phonon scattering .",
    "we first describe the use of neutron polarization analysis @xcite which , in principle , can unambiguously separate magnetic from non magnetic processes . for the polarized experimental setup , a crystal of @xmath82fe(si ) [ @xmath83  ] and crystals of heusler alloy cu@xmath3mnal [ @xmath84  ]",
    "were used as a monochromator and analyzer , respectively .",
    "the polarization state of the neutron beam can be changed by a spin - flipping device ( mezei coil ) that is placed in the incident beam _ before _ the sample .",
    "the combination of a @xmath82fe(si ) ( 110 ) monochromator and a heusler ( 111 ) analyzer permits spin - flip ( sf ) measurements without using the mezei coil because the polarization of the neutrons scattered by the @xmath82fe(si ) is along the applied field direction while it is opposite for the heusler crystal . for the measurements ,",
    "the final neutron energy was fixed at 30.5 mev , and a pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) filter was used before the analyzer .",
    "the polarization is usually determined by measuring the flipping ratio @xmath85 , defined as the ratio of neutrons reflected by the analyzer with the flipper ( mezei coil ) `` on '' [ which corresponds to neutron nonspin flip ( nsf ) , or @xmath86 and `` off '' [ neutron spin - flip ( sf ) or @xmath87 . assuming the flipping ratios for guide field parallel ( horizontal field or hf ) and perpendicular ( vertical field or vf ) to the wave vector @xmath88 are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively , the observed neutron cross sections for a paramagnetic system are given by @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the magnetic , @xmath93 the nuclear , @xmath94 the nuclear spin incoherent neutron cross section , and @xmath95 is the background .",
    "inspection of eq .",
    "[ 2.2 ] reveals that the most effective way to detect a magnetic signal is to measure sf scattering with hf .",
    "although such method has been successfully used to identify the magnetic origin of resonance peaks in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite , the advantage of the technique comes at a considerable cost in intensity which makes it impractical for observing small magnetic signals .    as a consequence ,",
    "most of our experiments were performed with unpolarized neutrons with be ( 002 ) or pg ( 002 ) as monochromators as specified in the figure captions . in these experiments",
    ", we also used pg(002 ) as analyzers .",
    "fast neutrons were removed from the incident beam by an in - pile sapphire filter , and pg filters were used to remove high - order neutron contaminations where appropriate .",
    "the horizontal collimations were controlled with soller slits and are specified in the figures containing the experimental data . to separate the magnetic from phonon scattering , we utilize the differences in their temperature and wave vector dependence of the cross sections . while the phonon scattering gains intensity on warming due to the thermal population factor , the magnetic signal usually becomes weaker because it spreads throughout the energy and momentum space at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , magnetic intensity should decrease at large wave vectors due to the reduction in the magnetic form factor while phonon and multi - phonon scattering are expected to increase with increasing wave vector .",
    "therefore , in an unpolarized neutron scattering measurement the net intensity gain above the multi - phonon background on cooling at appropriate wave vectors is likely to be magnetic in origin .",
    "previous experiments have utilized this method to discover incommensurate spin fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "figure 1 depicts the reciprocal lattice of the yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) directions shown in square lattice notation .",
    "our crystals are all highly twined so we can not distinguish @xmath96 from @xmath98 .",
    "because the cuo@xmath3 planes in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 actually appear in coupled bilayers that are separated by a much larger distance between the bilayer , spin fluctuations that are in - phase ( acoustic or @xmath100 ) or out - of - phase ( optical or @xmath101 ) with respect to the neighboring plane will have different spectra @xcite .",
    "it is therefore convenient to separate the magnetic response of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 into two parts @xmath102 , where @xmath103 ( 3.342  ) is the spacing between the nearest - neighbor cuo@xmath3 planes along @xmath70 . for the af insulating parent compound yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath104 , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "correspond to the acoustic and optical spin - wave excitations , respectively @xcite .",
    "because the interesting features such as the resonance and incommensurate fluctuations @xcite are only observed in the acoustic channel of spin susceptibility @xmath105 and the optical fluctuations occur at higher energies than the acoustic excitations , we focused on the temperature , frequency , and composition dependence of spin excitations in the acoustic mode which has a modulation @xmath106 along the @xmath70-axis .    for this purpose",
    ", we used several crystal orientations and scattering geometries .",
    "previous work by different groups @xcite were focused on the behavior of magnetic excitations for @xmath2 in the @xmath107 and/or @xmath108 zone . in view of the fact that the low frequency spin fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 peak at a quartet of incommensurate positions @xmath18",
    "rlu away from @xmath109 , @xmath29 , as depicted in fig",
    ". 1 @xcite , we scanned along the arrow direction in fig . 1 from @xmath110 to @xmath111 with fixed @xmath112 .",
    "to perform these scans , we first aligned the crystal with its [ 1,0,0 ] and [ 0,0,1 ] axes along the rotational axes of the lower ( @xmath113-axis ) and upper ( @xmath114-axis ) arcs of the spectrometer goniometer , respectively .",
    "the crystal was then rotated @xmath115 degrees such that after the rotation the @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath117 $ ] axes were in the horizontal scattering plane . to access the maxima of acoustic spin fluctuations ,",
    "we chose @xmath118 or 5 rlu so the @xmath119 rotation angle would be approximately 37 or 17 degrees , respectively .",
    "one advantage of performing scans in this manner is that the scan direction is along the direction of incommensurate peaks and the narrow part of the resolution ellipse . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the narrow part of the spectrometer resolution matches the separation of the incommensurate peaks . therefore , this is a favorable geometry to study the evolution of the incommensurate magnetic excitations .",
    "in addition to the new experimental geometry , we also used the conventional @xmath108 zone as specified in the figure captions .",
    "we begin this section by noting that inelastic neutron scattering experiments over the last decade @xcite have provided valuable information about the evolution of the spin dynamics in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "the key features of the spin excitations spectra include a gap in the superconducting state , a pseudogap in the normal state , the resonance peak , and the incommensurate fluctuations below the resonance .",
    "the observation of remarkable similarities in spin incommensurate structure for the bilayer yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath30 @xcite and the single - layer la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 of the same hole doping density @xcite suggests that incommensurate magnetic fluctuations may be a universal feature of the cuprate superconductors . for the la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 system ,",
    "yamada and coworkers established the sr - doping dependence of the incommensurability @xmath18 of the spin fluctuations and found a remarkable linear relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath18 @xcite . in the case of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , balatsky and bourges @xcite suggested that a similar linear relationship exists between @xmath8 and the width in momentum space ( @xmath120 ) of the `` normal '' spin fluctuations , i.e. , fluctuations at frequencies away from the resonance .",
    "the authors argued that spin excitations of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 have two components and the low - energy incommensurate fluctuations are different than the commensurate resonance .",
    "the conclusions of @xcite were reached based mostly on data where explicit incommensurability in the low - frequency spin fluctuations was not observed .",
    "therefore , it is still not clear whether the linear relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath18 is a universal feature of the cuprates .",
    "below , we present our systematic investigation of spin excitations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .      as stressed in sec .",
    "iib , it is not a trivial matter to separate the magnetic scattering from phonon and other spurious processes in metallic crystals of yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .",
    "although the use of polarized neutrons can provide an unambiguous measure of the magnetic and phonon scattering @xcite , the technique usually suffers from the limited flux available with polarized neutrons . nevertheless , polarization analysis has distinctive advantages in separating the magnetic signal from phonon and other spurious processes .",
    "as an example , we show in figure 3 the polarization analysis of the spin excitations for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath50 at temperatures above and below @xmath8 .    because magnetic fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 are centered around @xmath29 with a sinusoidal modulation along the @xmath121 direction",
    ", we oriented the crystal in the @xmath108 zone and searched for the magnetic signal with scans along @xmath122 which corresponds to the maximum intensity of the acoustic modulation . figures 3(a - c ) show the raw data of sf scattering for @xmath123 , 15 , and 24 mev at 60 and 11 k. the nsf scattering of the same scans are shown in figs .",
    "3(d - f ) . while sf scattering clearly peaks around @xmath29 , there are no similar features in the nsf scattering at the same position .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the scattering around @xmath29 in the sf scattering are magnetic in origin . to quantitatively parameterize the sf scattering data",
    ", we used a gaussian line shape on a linear background to fit the data as shown in solid lines in figs .",
    "3(a - c ) @xcite .",

    "although polarization analysis is excellent in identifying the magnetic nature of gaussian peaks around @xmath29 , the limited flux available with the technique means that detailed wave vector and energy dependence of the scattering need to be obtained with unpolarized neutrons . for this purpose",
    ", we realigned the sample in the @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath117 $ ] zone .",
    "figure 4 shows the constant-@xmath120 scans at various temperatures at @xmath29 .",
    "the spectra consist of two major peaks at @xmath130 and 31 mev .",
    "while the intensity of the @xmath130 mev mode follows the bose population factor @xmath80 $ ] consistent with phonons , the scattering at @xmath131 mev decreases with warming which is indicative of its magnetic origin . as we shall demonstrate below , phonons are also present at @xmath132 mev .",
    "however , phonon scattering in this energy range is expected to change negligibly with temperature for @xmath133 k. therefore , the difference spectra in fig .",
    "4 can be regarded as changes in the dynamical susceptibility .",
    "clearly , there are spectral weight enhancements around 30 mev with decreasing temperature above and below @xmath8 . if we define the susceptibility gain on cooling above @xmath8 at the resonance energy as the precursor of the resonance , we find that the spectral weight of the resonance increases slightly from the normal to the superconducting state [ fig .",

    "@xcite in underdoped compounds , is different from the energy independent incommensurability of the low - frequency spin fluctuations in la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 @xcite .",

    "in particular , the saturation of the incommensurability at @xmath32 for effective hole concentration @xmath189 ( fig .",
    "24 ) is puzzling . assuming that the incommensurate spin fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 at all doping levels are due to dynamic stripes composed of the hole - rich metallic regions separated by the antiphase insulating domains @xcite",

    "@xcite are consistent with the stripe formation in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 for effective hole doping below 0.1 . to truly understand the microscopic origin of the incommensurate spin fluctuations in different cuprates using a stripe model ,",
    "perhaps one needs to first explain the presence of resonance in the bilayer compounds , which takes much of the weight of the total magnetic scattering , and its absence in the single - layer materials @xcite . for highly doped materials ,",
    "the incommensurate spin fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 appears to be intimately related to the resonance as they occur only at energies very close to the resonance . from the magnetic field dependence of the spin excitations @xcite",
    ", it is clear that the resonance measures the pairing and long - range phase coherence .",
    "thus , if a stripe model can explain the resonance , it may also be able to account for the differences in the incommensurability in la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 .    alternatively , assuming that the observed incommensurate fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 come from a nested fermi surface @xcite",
    ", one may ask whether such models can predict the observed intensity and doping dependent behavior .",
    "unfortunately , there are no explicit predictions about the doping dependence of the incommensurability and its relationship with the resonance from a nested fermi surface model that can be directly compared with our experiments .",
    "therefore , it is still not clear whether the observed incommensurate fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 are consistent with the fermi - liquid description at all doping levels . in particular , the abrupt saturation of the incommensurability for yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath52",
    "suggests that the physics accounting for this behavior may have a different microscopic origin from that of the lower doping compounds .",
    "since the discovery of the resonance in highly doped and underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite , many fundamentally different microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain its origin . in the earlier theoretical studies @xcite ,",
    "the resonance is interpreted as the consequence of the @xmath103-wave gap symmetry of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "subsequent workers have noticed that @xmath103-wave superconductivity alone is insufficient to explain the resonance , and that very strong coulomb correlations among electrons must also play an important role . in some models",
    ", the band structure anomaly effects alone can produce a peak in spin susceptibility that grows with the opening of the superconducting gap @xcite , while other workers have applied a random - phase approximation ( rpa ) to treat the effects of strong coulomb correlations with the lindhard function appropriate for either a fermi liquid @xcite or a spin - charge separated metal @xcite .",
    "in particular , the resonance has been treated as a disordered magnon - like collective mode in the particle - hole channel whose energy is bound by the superconducting energy gap @xcite . using a completely different approach @xcite , the resonance is viewed as a pseudo - goldstone boson mode in the particle - particle channel instead of the more conventional particle - hole channel . in the framework of this theory , antiferromagnetism and @xmath103-wave superconductivity in copper oxides",
    "are treated in equal footing @xcite , and resonance is directly responsible for the superconducting condensation energy @xcite .    while the purpose of this article is not to review the similarities and differences among various models of the resonance , we wish to make several general remarks in light of the results described here and in recent field - dependent studies of the resonance @xcite .",
    "first , it is now clear that the incommensurability and the resonance are inseparable parts of the general features of the spin dynamics in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 at all dopings .",
    "thus any microscopic model used to describe the resonance must also be able to explain the doping and energy dependence of the incommensurate spin fluctuations .",
    "while current theoretical models do not provide explicit predictions that can be directly compared our experiments @xcite , it is hoped that the work described here will stimulate future theoretical efforts in this direction .",
    "the remarkable field dependence of the resonance @xcite indicates that it measures the superconducting pairing and phase coherence . in particular , the larger @xmath70-axis field effect is difficult to understand within the framework of the interlayer tunneling theory , according to which the resonance should be strongly affected by the in - plane field that disrupts the coherent josephson coupling along @xmath70-axis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the field data @xcite are consistent with mechanism where the dominant loss of entropy on entering the superconducting state is due to the growth of magnetic correlations in the cuo@xmath3 planes @xcite .",
    "finally , if the resonance is a magnon - like collective mode @xcite , it must not be a spin - wave in the conventional sense as the intensity of spin - wave excitations in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets should be magnetic field independent for the relatively small fields used @xcite .",
    "in this article , we have described in detail the extensive polarized and unpolarized neutron measurements of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 of superconducting yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 above and below the transition temperature @xmath8 . using a careful polarization and temperature dependence analysis",
    ", we find that the resonance and incommensurate spin fluctuations are general features of the spin dynamical behavior in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 for all oxygen doping levels .",
    "we establish the doping dependence of the incommensurability , the resonance , and the superconducting spin - gap energy . in the superconducting state , we find that the spin - gap energy is proportional to @xmath13 , but the resonance energy itself deviates from the linear behavior with @xmath13 for oxygen doping close to the optimal values .",
    "similarly , we show that the doping dependence of the incommensurability saturates to @xmath19 for oxygen doping @xmath52 . we compare the observed behaviors in the two most studied superconducting copper - oxides la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 and yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 and discuss their similarities and differences .",
    "we stress that any comprehensive theoretical understanding of the spin dynamical behavior in these two families of materials must take into account the fact that the resonance so clearly seen in the bilayer yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 is absent in the single - layer la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 . for underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , the evolution of the resonance as a function of doping",
    "is illustrated .",
    "in particular , we find the enhancement of the susceptibility at the resonance energy above @xmath8 for all underdoped compounds including yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath33 . if we define the `` resonance '' as the enhancement of the susceptibility in a small energy range of the magnetic excitations spectra as a function of decreasing temperature , it is natural to associate the susceptibility gain around the resonance energy above @xmath8 in the underdoped compounds as the precursor of the resonance .",
    "this assertion is supported by the systematic studies of the evolution of the temperature dependence of the resonance that show the progressively larger pretransitional regime above @xmath8 for more underdoped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the resonance and incommensurate fluctuations appear to be intimately connected .",
    "thus , any microscopic model for the magnetic fluctuations in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 must be able to account for both the incommensurate spin fluctuations and the resonance .",

    "<S> polarized and unpolarized neutron triple - axis spectrometry was used to study the dynamical magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 as a function of energy ( @xmath1 ) and wave vector ( @xmath2 ) in a wide temperature range for the bilayer superconductor yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with oxygen concentrations , @xmath6 , of 0.45 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.93 , and 0.95 . </S>",
    "<S> the most prominent features in the magnetic spectra include a spin gap in the superconducting state , a pseudogap in the normal state , the much - discussed resonance , and incommensurate spin fluctuations below the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we establish the doping dependence of the spin gap in the superconducting state , the resonance energy , and the incommensurability of the spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the spin gap ( @xmath7 ) up to the optimal doping is proportional to the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance , which exists exclusively below @xmath8 for highly doped yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath10 and 0.95 , appears above @xmath8 for underdoped compounds with @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance energy ( @xmath12 ) also scales with @xmath13 , but saturates at @xmath14 mev for @xmath6 close to 0.93 . </S>",
    "<S> the incommensurate spin fluctuations at energies below the resonance have structures similar to that of the single - layer superconducting la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 . however , there are also important differences . </S>",
    "<S> while the incommensurability ( @xmath18 ) of the spin fluctuations in la@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 is proportional to @xmath8 for the entire hole - doping range up to the optimal value , the incommensurability in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 increases with @xmath8 for low oxygen doping and saturates to @xmath19 for @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the incommensurability decreases with increasing energy close to the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the incommensurate spin fluctuations appear above @xmath8 in underdoped compounds with @xmath21 but for highly doped materials they are only observed below @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the procedure used for separating the magnetic scattering from phonon and other spurious effects . in the comparison of our experimental results with various microscopic theoretical models </S>",
    "<S> , particular emphasis was made to address the similarities and differences in the spin fluctuations of the two most studied superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly mention recent magnetic field dependent studies of the spin fluctuations and discuss their relevance in understanding the microscopic origin of the resonance . </S>"
