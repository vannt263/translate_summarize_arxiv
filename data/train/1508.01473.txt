    "effects in strong - field ionization of atoms attributed to the radiation pressure  @xcite have been studied recently both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that these effects are related to the photon momentum being transferred to the atomic system .",
    "hence , modifying the distributions of ionized electrons .",
    "such a phenomenon is absent in the nonrelativistic theoretical approach because of the dipole approximation applied to the laser field .    except for the ivanov s paper  @xcite , where the numerical solution of the dirac equation coupled to the 2-cycle laser pulse has been considered , in refs .",
    "@xcite different types of the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) have been applied that go beyond the dipole approximation .",
    "not surprisingly , in all cases the radiation pressure effects have become visible .",
    "the aim of this paper is to further develop the sfa approach and to analyze angular distributions of photoelectrons ionized by linearly - polarized few - cycle pulses .",
    "this is in contrast to previous works  @xcite where circularly - polarized fields were considered in order to describe multiphoton ionization .",
    "our numerical analysis concerns the multiphoton ionization of hydrogen atoms , even though we expect that similar effects should be observed for heavier atomic systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : laser ] , we will define properties of linearly - polarized and short laser pulses . for such pulses , in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we will formulate three types of sfa approaches to ionization , each in the velocity gauge . in secs .  [ sec : angle1 ] ,  [ sec : angle2 ] , and  [ sec : angle3 ] , we shall compare predictions of these approaches and investigate effects related to the radiation pressure in angular distributions of photoelectrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we will draw some conclusions and formulate prospects for further investigations .    in this paper",
    "we keep @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the fine - structure constant equals @xmath2 . in our numerical analysis",
    "we use relativistic units ( rel . units ) such that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron rest mass .",
    "furthermore , we denote the product of any two four - vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , where the einstein summation convention is used .",

    "finally , we use the light - cone variables . for a given space direction determined by a unit vector @xmath16 ( which in this paper denotes the direction of the pulse propagation ) and for an arbitrary four - vector @xmath17",
    ", we define these variables such that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the relativistic scalar product is @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "while in prior investigations of radiation pressure effects in multiphoton ionization  @xcite the circularly - polarized laser fields have been considered , in this work we consider the laser field of a linear polarization .",
    "we assume that the laser pulse lasts for time @xmath24 , which defines its fundamental frequency @xmath25 ( being the smallest frequency in the fourier decomposition of the pulse ) .",
    "we also assume that the plane - wave - fronted pulse approximation can be used , which means that the electromagnetic field is a function of the phase @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "we choose the system of coordinates such that the laser pulse propagates in the @xmath28-direction , @xmath29 , and its linear polarization vector is along the @xmath30-axis .",

    "the so - called shape function for the electromagnetic field , @xmath33 , vanishes for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and have a continuous first derivative for all real @xmath36 . in our numerical analysis ,",
    "we use the function with the sine - squared envelope , @xmath37 where @xmath38 defines the number of cycles in the pulse , and the positive real constant @xmath39 is adjusted such that the normalization condition : @xmath40 ^ 2=\\frac{1}{2}n^2_{\\mathrm{osc } } \\label{las3}\\ ] ] holds . with this normalization ,",

    "this suggests that any deviations from this symmetry can be attributed to the radiation pressure .",

    "@xcite ) . in the present investigations",
    "we choose the sfa in the velocity gauge , _ only _ because in the prior theoretical studies of the radiation pressure effects @xcite exactly this gauge ( up to the kramers - henneberger transformation ) has been considered .",
    "an extended discussion of these effects in the length gauge is going to be presented in due course .    in the following sections",
    ", we will formulate three versions of sfa in the velocity gauge . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsfa ] the nonrelativistic sfa ( nsfa ) will be presented , which then is followed by the fully relativistic sfa ( rsfa ) introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsfa ] .",
    "it is possible to reformulate the nsfa such that it accounts for the interaction of photoelectrons with their parent ions ( for instance , in terms of the complex - time trajectories , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for the rsfa",
    "it is not an easy task , although some attempts have been already undertaken  @xcite ( see , also the theoretical analysis for the klein - gordon equation  @xcite ) . for this reason",
    ", we will formulate in sec .",
    "[ sec : qrsfa ] the quasi - relativistic sfa ( qrsfa ) which computationally is not so demanding and , as being very similar to the nsfa , could be further generalized in terms of the complex - time trajectories .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to compare predictions of the qrsfa and the rsfa , and to determine for which laser pulse intensities the former approach is applicable .",
    "a general scheme for the sfa is as follows .",
    "we split the exact time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath65 into the static , @xmath66 , and the time - dependent , @xmath67 , parts .",
    "the latter accounts for the laser - matter interaction and it vanishes asymptotically ( i.e. , it vanishes in the remote past and future ) . for @xmath66 , we define the bound state @xmath68 of energy @xmath69 .",
    "then , the exact probability amplitude for the transition from the bound state @xmath68 to the scattering state @xmath70 , labeled by the asymptotic momentum @xmath59 , is equal to @xmath71 @xmath72 is the exact solution for the full hamiltonian @xmath73 which , for @xmath74 , tends to the specific scattering state with the incoming spherical waves defined for the hamiltonian @xmath66 .",
    "this state is very difficult to determine , therefore some approximations are applied .",
    "the sfa consists in replacing this exact solution by the so - called volkov solution  @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the influence of the binding potential is neglected , i.e. , the probability amplitude in the sfa becomes , @xmath75 here , the volkov solution @xmath76 fulfills the schrdinger equation , @xmath77|\\psi^{(0)}_{\\bm{p}}(t)\\rangle , \\label{sfa4}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is that part of @xmath66 which remains after neglecting the binding potential .",
    "this is equivalent to treating the exact solution @xmath70 in the lowest born approximation with respect to the binding potential .",
    "such an approximation is justified if the kinetic energy of photoelectrons is sufficiently large compared to the binding energy @xmath69 , or if the action of the laser pulse exceeds the influence of the binding potential for photoelectrons .    in the following discussion , in order to trace similarities between the nonrelativistic and relativistic approaches , we shall use the relativistic notation in both cases . for this purpose ,",
    "we rewrite eq .",

    "[ pedcone ] the ionization probability distribution in the nsfa does not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath64 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pdn4i14areiss1d20150625 ] , in which the nsfa is represented by the thick blue circle with the center located at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the results obtained in the rsfa and qrsfa are represented by the nearly identical closed curves ( almost circles in their shapes ) but with the center shifted towards the positive @xmath28-direction .",
    "this shift is the signature of the radiation pressure .",
    "we also observe that for the relativistic and quasi - relativistic sfa the results only marginally differ from each other .",
    "this means that , for the considered intensity of the laser field , it is not necessary to apply the full relativistic theory . in this case , the quasi - relativistic sfa very well describes the ionization distribution and effects related to the non - vanishing photon momentum .",
    "therefore , one wonders at which laser intensities the qrsfa fails , showing significant deviations from the rsfa . to answer this question , in fig .",
    "[ pdn4i14hreiss1d20150625 ] we compare all three approximations for much larger time - averaged intensity and a higher final kinetic energy of photoelectrons . as expected , the nsfa shows the rotational symmetry but both the qrsfa and rsfa exhibit much more complex structures , with many lobes that result from quantum interferences induced by the radiation pressure .",
    "it is also expected that the interference of probability amplitudes can enhance or suppress this effect , in the sense that the radiation pressure can either increase or decrease the photoelectron momentum along the propagation direction of the pulse . in the two figures presented in this section ,",
    "we have chosen the polar angles @xmath158 ( for a given kinetic energy of photoelectrons ) such that the averaged electron momentum parallel to the laser pulse propagation direction , i.e. , to the @xmath28-direction , is positive .",

    "if we analyze the corresponding expressions for the probability distributions we notice that for this particular direction , for which @xmath160 , they differ only by the momentum shift in the fourier transform of the bound state wavefunction , i.e. , by the retardation corrections .",
    "this suggests that the contributions to the radiation pressure effects originate mainly from the recoil corrections discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qrsfa ] . in order to account for them",
    "properly it is not sufficient ( or even not necessary ) to replace @xmath161 in the nsfa by @xmath162 , but modifications of the electron mass induced by the recoil corrections have to be considered .",
    "further improvements of the qrsfa can be achieved by accounting for higher relativistic corrections to the effective mass in the electron final state , that go beyond the original nordsieck substitution , @xmath163 in fig .",

    "a more detailed insight into the radiation pressure effects can be gained by investigating the polar - azimuthal angle distributions of photoelectrons at a given final energy . when choosing this energy one has to remember about the domain of validity of the sfa , as discussed above .",
    "note also that , for smaller laser intensities , one can not select too large energies of final electrons since the corresponding probability distributions are very small and so they contribute marginally to the overall effect .",

    "we have presented three types of the sfa developed for the velocity gauge .",
    "we have shown that , for the ti - sapphire laser pulses of intensities up to @xmath0 , the quasi - relativistic sfa predicts nearly identical effects as the full relativistic sfa for the dirac equation . in particular , we have discussed modifications related to the retardation and recoil corrections .",
    "we have shown that the dominant contribution to the radiation pressure originates from the recoil corrections to the nonrelativistic sfa .",
    "these findings create a possibility to modify the complex - time trajectory method for ionization such that it can account for the radiation pressure effects .",
    "also , we have demonstrated that , depending on photoelectrons final energies and polar angles , the radiation pressure effects can be of ` positive ' or ` negative ' types .",
    "they are more pronounced in the energy - angular distributions of ejected electrons than in the integrated , parallel ( with respect to the laser pulse propagation direction ) momentum distributions , where the overall effect is significantly suppressed .",
    "extensions of the theoretical methods considered here to the length gauge and arbitrary laser pulse polarizations are under development and are going to be presented in due course .    to summarize",
    ", we have demonstrated that , for short laser pulses of time - averaged intensities not larger than @xmath0 with the carrier frequency of @xmath183 , the radiation pressure effects in ionization can be well described by the nonrelativistic keldysh theory provided that the electron mass is replaced by the effective momentum - dependent one .",
    "the latter accounts for the recoil of electrons during the absorption of laser photons .",
    "this has been shown by analyzing differential probability distributions in the nonrelativistic and relativistic strong - field approximations in the velocity gauge , but we expect that the same conclusion is also valid for the length gauge .",
