    "such an mcp - pmt made it possible to realize @xmath9 ps of a tof counter for 4 gev / c pion beams  @xcite .",

    "the mcp - pmt having these superb properties lets us develop a new type of cherenkov ring imaging counter , a time - of - propagation ( top ) counter  @xcite , for particle identification at a planned super - kekb factory with an expected luminosity of @xmath14 /@xmath15sec , which is 50-times as intense as the achieved luminosity of the current kekb factory , and is expected to survive for more than 14 years under this situation .",
    "we here report on r&d results of a newly developed mcp - pmt , which is equipped with 4 anodes rather than a single anode , and shaped to be square , not round , from the required performance on the top counter .",
    "when setting a multi - anode structure , an additional r&d issue arises : it shows a cross - talk effect .",
    "while cross - talk basically occurs among the anodes , its influence is in most cases is harmless for measurements of the incident - particle energies or a number of tracks in terms of the pulse - height of output signals .",
    "however , for a precise time measurement , as discussed here , the cross - talk deteriorates the timing performance , and sometimes makes it ineffectual , in much the same way that occurs for a vacuum pmt , as reported  @xcite . based on our tests for various modified versions of the mcp - pmt",

    "there are then appreciable probabilities that plural sl10 s detect @xmath34 photons in an event .",
    "a primary single - photon would induce cross - talk on other anodes in the same sl10 , so that the pulse shape of the secondary arriving single - photon on the anode would be affected , and thus deteriorate the timing information .",

    "we extensively studied the cross - talk on a multi - anode 16-channel linear array vacuum pmt  @xcite , and here just also found the same phenomena for the sl10 .",

    "the anode , @xmath39 mm@xmath17 , and the last electrode of the mcp separated by a 1 mm gap , would form a capacitance of @xmath401 pf ; a short hv line from the hv bleeder network to the last electrode would yield an inductance of @xmath4150 nh ; also , individual anodes are terminated with a resistance of @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "we thought out that one way to reduce the cross - talk by disconnecting this rlc loop circuit is to make a segmentation of the mcp electrode facing to 4 anodes , and to prepare 4 separate hv networks , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the primary light is detected by ch.3 through a mask , and the divided and then delayed light is by ch.1 as shown in fig .",

    "data with open circles and open squares are those obtained by sl10-s and sl10-m , respectively , using a voltage threshold type of discriminator ; the closed squares indicate data by the sl10-m , but with constant fraction discrimination .",

    "even so , the latter resolution is worse than the @xmath51 ps attained at the incidence of sole single photons .",
    "although sl10-m successfully reduces the cross - talk , it does not recover the original time resolution of @xmath51 ps for single photons .",
    "the cross - talk effect also appears as a shift of the observed absolute time of the delayed photons , as plotted in fig .",

    "the difference , @xmath52 , between the observed time and @xmath44 behaves as expected from the cross - talk pulse ( see , fig .",
    "[ f-10 ] ) . when the base line shifts to the positive side in voltage , @xmath52 moves to a positive delay , and vise - versa .",
    "this fact indicates that the signal pulse is not broken away by the cross - talk , rather it keeps its intrinsic signal shape upon a tiny cross - talk disturbance .",
    "we replaced a leading - edge type of discriminator with a constant fractional discriminator ( cfd , kaizu - works kn381 ) , since the latter provides an output pulse at zero - crossing timing of a differentiated input pulse so that it would not be strongly affected by the cross - talk , as the former would be . the resulting @xmath32 and @xmath52 with the cross - talk are plotted by closed squares with error bars in fig .",
    "the time resolution largely improved to @xmath53 ps with no large variation in @xmath44 .",
    "the timing shift has also been reduced by a factor of 2 : @xmath54 ps . however , because its maximum shift is about the same size as the time resolution it is not a trivial matter , unless it is corrected by referring to the timing of the primary signal .",
    "we have developed a square - shaped 4-anode mcp - pmt , sl10 , to measure the precise timing of single photons .",
    "it provides a performance that satisfies the requirement on our top - counter : @xmath55 , @xmath56 ps for single photons under a 1.5 t magnetic field strength , and durable up to @xmath28 /@xmath11/s of a high photon rate .    in order to suppress the cross - talk effect on the timing measurement in the case of plural photon injection , we have taken two measures .",
    "one way is to subdivide the electrode of the last mcp - layer into 4 pieces , facing the anodes : it successfully reduces the cross - talk size to one half .",
    "the second way is to use a constant fractional discriminator , instead of the leading - edge type one .",
