    "the aries baker - nunn schmidt telescope project was initiated during 2005 to use its wide - area imaging capabilities for numerous scientific purposes with modern ccd detector .",
    "the telescope will be installed at manora peak , nainital , india ( longitude : 79@xmath2 18@xmath3 00@xmath4 e and latitude : 29@xmath2 22@xmath3 00@xmath4 n ) .",
    "scientific programs like study of variable stars , asteroids and near - earth - objects , detecting of extra - solar planets though transit method , transient objects like grbs and supernovae , and imaging of large star clusters could be suitably accomplished with this wide - field imaging telescope .",
    "the photographic palomar all - sky surveys is one of most important contribution from the 1.2-m samuel oschin schmidt , 1.2 m uk - schmidt and 1-m eso schmidt telescopes @xcite .",
    "the near - earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) project has recently instrumented the palomar samuel oschin telescope with 4080 @xmath0 4080 ccds covering of @xmath53.75 deg@xmath6 field of view @xcite .",
    "recently , quest ( quasar equatorial survey team ) collaboration uses the 1-m schmidt telescope located at the venezuelan national astronomical observatory with 16 ccds ( 2048 @xmath72048 ) arranged in a 4 @xmath0 4 mosaic covering 2.3@xmath2 @xmath0 3.5@xmath2 of the sky @xcite . the automated patrol telescope ( apt ) at siding spring observatory , australia operated by the university of new south wales ( unsw ) uses a 0.5 m telescope with 770 @xmath0 1150 ccd covering 2@xmath2 @xmath0 3@xmath2 field of view @xcite .",
    "the unsw extra - solar planet search is the major scientific project using the apt facilities @xcite , and produced several variable stars as a byproducts @xcite .",
    "the fabra - roa telescope project aims to refurbish an f/1 0.5 m baker - nunn camera ( bnc ) with 4096 @xmath0 4096 ccd covering a field of view of 4.4@xmath2 @xmath0 4.4@xmath2 for the robotic surveying purposes , this re - furbishing project is similar like the aries bn schmidt telescope project .",
    "the basic optical design of the baker - nunn camera at aries uses a three - element corrector to produce an extremely wide field of view ( 5@xmath2 @xmath0 30@xmath2 ) across a curved plane at the prime focus for photographic imaging .",
    "the transformation of the baker - nunn camera into a 50 cm schmidt telescope with ccd imaging capabilities is a process which comprises several steps in different categories .",
    "major jobs in this project are ( i ) modification of optical design for curved to flat focal plane ( ccd observations ) , ( ii ) changing the mounting system from alt - azimuthal to equatorial english mount ( mechanical re - designing ) , ( iii ) computer control of the telescope , ( iv ) optical alignment and installing new customize ccd imaging system .",
    "to accommodate ccd detectors in the focal plane , the field should be flat .",
    "the optical design of the telescope needs to be corrected for flat focal plane as wide as possible with acceptable geometric distortion .",
    "the new design for baker - nunn schmidt telescope incorporates two new optical elements , one field flattener lens and one meniscus lens , with old optical elements that include 80 cm f/1 primary mirror and 50 cm aperture 3-elements corrector lens system .",
    "the field flattener is used to flatten the curved field .",
    "the lens is 55 mm diameter double convex lens and placed inside ccd camera at distance 1.66 mm from the ccd chip to avoid from introducing unacceptable aberrations .",
    "a meniscus lens is placed between focal plane and primary mirror .",
    "the meniscus lens provides the correction for the astigmatism introduced by the field flattener .",
    "the optical layout of the bnc telescope showing new optical elements is shown in fig .",
    "1a .",
    "the optical system of the schmidt telescope consists of a 3-element air - spaced schmidt corrector lens system with an aperture of 50-cm , a spherical primary mirror of 80 cm diameter . the optical elements and their positions in the telescope including some useful parameters are listed in the table 1 .",

    "for a ccd , the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) from a point source is determined by a well - known ccd equation @xcite , which is given by ,    @xmath8    where n@xmath9 is the total photon counts from the star ( sky subtracted ) , n@xmath10 is counts from the sky .",
    "the n@xmath11 and n@xmath12 are the dark current and read out noise , and it is the characteristic of the ccd .",
    "the n@xmath13 is the total number of pixels contained within the selected aperture for the photometry , it is related to _ seeing _ of the site . here ,",
    "star images are approximately 20 -25 @xmath14 m in diameter , this spot size is a practical lower limit for the optical system . considering the image size",
    ", n@xmath13 is chosen to be @xmath5 3 pixels , corresponding to @xmath5 11 _ arcsecond _ in the sky .",
    "the _ seeing _ is @xmath5 2 -2.5 _ arcsecond _ for our site , which is far below the spot size of an image .",
    "the parameters , listed in the table 3 and 4 , are considered for estimation of the snr and shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the snr is basically related to the photometric error , @xmath15 @xmath5 _ 1.085/snr_. the predicted magnitude limit is v @xmath16 19 for a 10@xmath17 detection and an exposure time of 300 @xmath18 .",
    "a photometric precision of 1% ( @xmath19 @xmath5 0.01 ) for a v = 15.5 star with exposure time of 100 @xmath18 is estimated from photon statistics from the star and the sky background .",
    "the theoretical limit of the maximum photometric accuracy from the system is related to the linear full well capacity of the detector , the limit here is 3 _ millimagnitude_.",
    "we present here the development of aries baker - nunn telescope project , which is re - designed from a baker - nunn satellite tracking camera .",
    "the telescope will be used in a wide - field imaging mode using the custom designed ccd camera for various astronomical research programs .",
    "the optical components in the new design , like field - flatterner lens and minicus lens , are procured from the standard optical companies .",
    "the custom designed ccd camera is in the processes of the procurement from the finger lakes instrument , usa . the first - light from the telescope is expecting during the mid-2009 .",
