    "indeed , the current constraints rule out many alternative explanations , including clusters of stellar mass compact objects @xcite and fermion balls @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it remains to be conclusively demonstrated that the dark mass at the galactic center is a true black hole with an event horizon .",
    "if is not a black hole , then it must have a surface at some radius @xmath11 .",
    "although general relativistic considerations coupled with reasonable assumptions on the equation of state of matter require @xmath12 ( see , , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , alternatives to general relativity exist which allow smaller radii , despite the fact that the exterior spacetime may be arbitrarily close to that predicted by general relativity ( , scalar - tensor theories , @xcite , gravastars , @xcite , boson stars @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in principle , @xmath11 could have any value greater than @xmath13 , the horizon radius ( we restrict our analysis to non - spinning objects ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we show that current observations do not favor having such a surface .",
    "we assume that any putative surface of is in steady state in the presence of accreting gas , and that it emits the accreted energy thermally .",
    "the latter assumption is reasonable since , even for models in which the radius of the surface approaches @xmath13 , the thermalization timescale is short in comparison to the lifetime of ( or of an observer ) s at the surface . since the timescale diverges only logarithmically as measured at infinity",
    "even for extremely compact configurations ( , the gravastar ) , the thermalization time is increased by only a few orders of magnitude . ] .",
    "indeed , for surfaces contained well within the photon orbit , strong gravitational lensing significantly decreases the number of photon trajectories that escape to infinity .",
    "most outgoing rays return to be absorbed by other parts of the surface , so that the object will resemble the classical example of a blackbody : a thermal cavity with a pinhole .    if  accretes at the bondi rate from the hot gas surrounding it , the accretion rate is expected to be @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a more likely scenario is that the source accretes via a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , with a mass accretion rate in the range @xmath15 . in a riaf model , essentially all the potential energy released by the accreting gas would be radiated from the surface of ( assuming it has a surface ) , with a predicted luminosity at infinity of @xmath16 where the efficiency factor @xmath17 is the fraction of the rest mass energy of the infalling gas that is released as radiation . in the newtonian case , @xmath17 is simply @xmath18 . in general relativity , @xmath17 is given in terms of the gravitational redshift @xmath19 at the surface : @xmath20 although it is highly unlikely that  has a radiatively _ efficient _ accretion disk , even such a model requires a fairly large @xmath21 . for example",
    ", the observed bolometric luminosity of of @xmath22 implies a minimum accretion rate of @xmath23 for a radiative efficiency of 10% . to within a factor of a few ( depending on the nature of the boundary layer at the inner edge of the disk ) ,",
    "the luminosity from the surface of is again predicted to be @xmath24 with @xmath17 not very different from ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "all the above estimates are for gas accretion",
    ". when stellar capture events are considered , the average accretion rate can be as high as @xmath25 to @xmath26 , though this would be expected to be in the form of transient accretion events @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath21 estimates given here are from the point of view of a distant observer , i.e. , they represent the rate of accretion of rest mass per unit time as measured at infinity .    in   2 , we derive upper limits on @xmath21 from the observed near - infrared ( nir ) fluxes of and compare these with the various estimates of @xmath21 given above . on this basis we argue that  is unlikely to have a surface and therefore that it must be a black hole . in   3 , we present theoretical images of the riaf model discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and show that imaging experiments alone can not distinguish between a black hole and a compact object with a surface .",
    "however , by combining imaging with the argument presented in   2 , we show that one could make the case for an event horizon stronger .",
    "we conclude in   4 with a discussion . in what follows ,",
    "unless otherwise noted , we use geometrized units ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the observed flux @xmath28 at a frequency @xmath29 from a surface emitting thermal blackbody radiation is simply the blackbody spectrum multiplied by the apparent solid angle of the surface on the sky . for a thermally emitting compact spherical surface at the galactic center",
    "this is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the blackbody temperature as measured by the observer ( at infinity ) , @xmath32 is the distance to the galactic center , and the apparent size @xmath33 of the radiating surface is given in terms of its radius @xmath11 by @xmath34 equation ( 4 ) includes the general relativistic correction due to strong lensing .",
    "note that , for @xmath11 inside the photon orbit @xmath35 , the apparent size @xmath33 no longer decreases with decreasing @xmath11 .    for a given choice of radius @xmath11 and",
    "a given upper limit on the flux @xmath28 , equations ( [ fnu ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) provide an upper limit @xmath36 on the observed temperature ( at infinity ) and hence a limit on the surface luminosity as measured at infinity : @xmath37 .",
    "then , from equations ( [ lsurf ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) we obtain the following upper limit on the mass accretion rate on the surface , @xmath38 thus , for each flux measurement @xmath28 of and an assumed radius @xmath11 , we obtain an estimate of @xmath39 , the maximum accretion rate for that @xmath11 . this limit , which assumes nothing more than blackbody emission , can be compared with the mass accretion rates which are required to explain the observed luminosity and spectra of ( discussed in   1 ) .",

    "the surface is assumed to radiate as a blackbody . for reference ,",
    "the photon orbit @xmath48 is shown by the vertical dashed line .",
    "the cross - hatched area at the top corresponds to typical mass accretion rates in riaf models of , and the horizontal dashed line represents the minimum accretion rate needed to power the bolometric luminosity of ( see   1 ) . ]    in practice , the strongest limits are placed by observations in the nir , since the postulated thermal emission from the surface of peaks in this region of the spectrum .",
    "the most constraining observations are listed in table [ flux_limits ] , and the corresponding limits on @xmath49 are plotted in figure [ mdot_limits ] . note that the thermal emission from the surface peaks in the nir for @xmath50 , whereas for larger radii the surface is sufficiently cool that the observed fluxes fall in the wien regime , resulting in a weakening of the limit on @xmath36 and hence on @xmath21 .",
    "the difference in character between the limit imposed by observations at @xmath47 and the other wavelengths is due to the fact that the former passes into the rayleigh - jeans regime at a larger radius . the overall limit on @xmath21 is simply given by the lower envelope of all four curves in figure [ mdot_limits ] ;",
    "the envelope is dominated by the @xmath51 curve .",
    "recent observations at @xmath7 and @xmath8 have claimed to resolve , limiting the radius to @xmath52 at these wavelengths @xcite . as seen in figure [ mdot_limits ] , this limit on the radius , coupled with the nir flux limits , already restricts the allowed accretion rate in  to @xmath53 , if the object has a surface . since the derived limit is two orders of magnitude lower than the lowest @xmath21 allowed by the observed luminosity of ( @xmath54 ) , and more than three orders of magnitude lower than the lowest accretion rate required by riaf models ( see   1 ) , the case for  not having a surface , i.e. , for it being a black hole , is very strong .",
    "as is apparent from figure [ mdot_limits ] , observations which can further limit @xmath11 will place even stronger constraints upon @xmath55 , and further strengthen the case for a black hole .",
    "submillimeter very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) promises to provide an angular resolution on the order of @xmath56 , corresponding to a physical scale @xmath57 at the galactic center .",
    "a significant motivation for developing such a capability is the prospect of imaging the silhouette or `` shadow '' of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the shadow is due to strong lensing , and its detection would be a strong confirmation of one of the major predictions of general relativity in the limit of strong gravity",
    ". such imaging will also constrain the radius of s surface and thus strengthen the argument presented in   2 .",
    "figure [ images ] shows theoretical submillimeter vlbi images of a riaf model of for a number of assumed radii ranging from @xmath58 larger than the horizon to @xmath59 . in all cases the mass accretion rate",
    "is taken to be @xmath60 , the canonical value for riaf models and orders of magnitude above the limits placed in the preceding section .",
    "surface radii in excess of the photon orbit ( @xmath35 ) appear as enlarged silhouettes , as may be seen in the bottom panels .",
    "thus , high resolution imaging can immediately limit the size of any radiating surface in to less than @xmath35 .",
    "combined with the nir flux limits , this would strengthen the limit upon the mass accretion rate by nearly another order of magnitude , making a conclusive case for an event horizon .",
    "interestingly , we see that for radii inside of the photon orbit , the images are nearly indistinguishable from the case in which a horizon is present .",
    "this is a direct result of the relatively low temperature of the radiating surface ( @xmath61 as measured at infinity ) coupled with the fact that at submillimeter wavelengths the emission occurs deep in the rayleigh - jeans portion of the spectrum .",
    "thus , while submillimeter imaging can limit the radius of , it can not by itself prove that the object is a black hole .",
    "it is only when the imaging results are combined with the nir flux measurements in the manner discussed in ",
    "2 that a strong case can be made for the existence of a horizon .",
    "we have shown in this _ letter _ that current nir flux limits on already place a stringent upper limit upon the mass accretion rate of this compact object , assuming that the object possesses a surface .",
    "comparison of these rates to the observed submillimeter luminosity of the source , and the implied lower limit on the mass accretion rate , leads to a serious contradiction , thus providing strong evidence for the absence of a surface .",
    "this argument for being a black hole is robust ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for other evidence ) .",
    "the argument applies even when the surface is extremely compact , , as expected in gravastar models ( see , , * ? ? ?",
    "note from equations ( [ lsurf ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) that the extremely large gravitational redshift at the surface of an ultra - compact object ( @xmath62 ) does not cause a reduction in the luminosity observed at infinity . on the contrary , for a given @xmath21 , the observed luminosity is maximum when the redshift goes to infinity ( this is in contrast to * ? ? ? * in which the intrinsic luminosity measured on the surface , as opposed to the mass accretion rate measured at infinity , was assumed to be fixed ) .",
    "in addition , the blackbody assumption on which our argument is based is particularly well motivated when the redshift is large (   1 ) .    three critical assumptions underly our conclusions : ( _ i _ ) the surface is in steady state with respect to the accreting material , ( _ ii _ ) the surface radiates thermally , and ( _ iii _ ) general relativity is an appropriate description of gravity external to the surface .",
    "as mentioned briefly in   1 , the assumption of steady state is likely to be a good one , even for surfaces very near the horizon ( including those which are separated from the horizon by a planck length , the minimum scale for which a horizon will not develop ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that for a black hole the unradiated binding energy of the accreting matter contributes to an increase of the black hole s mass .",
    "thus a black hole is an explicit example of an accreting compact object which is not in steady state .    of more concern",
    "is the assumption that the surface emits thermally . for models in which large - scale correlations play a significant role ( , the gravastar )",
    "it is unclear what happens to accreting material .",
    "for instance , it is conceivable that one may obtain coherent emission with wavelengths comparable to the correlation length of the surface , which in principle could introduce large deviations from the planck spectrum .",
    "while we can not rule out such a model , we would like to emphasize that , in general , for the gravastar ( or similar ) model to remain a viable alternative to the black hole model of necessarily requires an extremely exotic emission mechanism that deviates enormously from blackbody emission .",
    "finally , some assumption regarding the description of gravity external to the surface is necessary to compute the flux due to a compact surface near a strongly gravitating object . in the absence of a well tested alternative ,",
    "general relativity is the natural choice and this is what we have selected for our calculations .",
    "while we have explicitly considered a non - rotating black hole , we expect rotation ( the most obvious extension that one would wish to consider ) to primarily broaden the thermal spectrum , changing our results by no more than factors of order unity .",
    "multi - wavelength high - resolution imaging of flares in the galactic center has been proposed as a method by which the nature of the spacetime surrounding the galactic center s black hole may be probed @xcite .    to summarize , in the absence of unknown exotic phenomena , the current nir flux measurements already conclusively imply the existence of an event horizon in the black hole candidate at the galactic center .",
    "we would like to thank avi loeb for pointing out the highly enhanced accretion rate of due to stellar capture events .",
