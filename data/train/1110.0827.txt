    "the `` corrected ''",
    "hm method derives the kinematics for that segment of the cme along the assumed circular structure that best matches the in situ spacecraft measurements at a distance of 1  au ( comparison between timing and speed ) .",

    "furthermore , we have to take into account an error owing to the uncertainty in the direction of motion when converting the elongation into radial distance .",
    "the best match between remote observations and in situ data has to fulfill the criteria that the arrival time and speed of the remotely observed cme at 1  au needs to be as close as possible to the impact time and speed of the icme as derived from in situ data .",
    "since both criteria are not fulfilled at the same time , we derive an uncertainty in the deduced direction of motion .",

    "observations of three cme / icme events tracked during their propagation from sun to 1  au are studied with respect to their kinematical evolution in ip space and effects resulting from the ambient solar wind . for future studies on the aerodynamic drag force owing to the solar wind",
    ", it is of special interest to know the distance at which the cme speed becomes adjusted to the ambient solar wind flow . to this aim",
    ", we applied the 3d mhd model enlil to simulate the steady background solar wind outflow for the inner - heliosphere and compare it with the cme speed evolution in ip space derived from stereo - a / cor and hi observations .    in general",
    ", for each of the events under study the outcome from mas+enlil and wsa+enlil models reveals differences in the resulting distribution of the solar wind speed over the sun - earth distance range , though based on the same input magnetograms ( nso / kitt peak ) . by comparing in situ measurements of the solar wind speed with the simulated solar wind speed at that location , we find that the model runs can be used to obtain a general view of the situation in ip space",
    ". for times of high solar activity both model runs give less reliable results since the occurrence of fast ejecta affecting the solar wind flow is not taken into account in the enlil background solar wind modeling .",
    "most likely we find such a situation during cr  2095 covering event  3 . in a systematic comparison between model results ( mas+enlil and wsa+enlil ) and in situ measurements of the solar wind parameters at 1  au over a time range of several months , @xcite found that the overall shape and trends of the low- and high - density structures , the low- and high - speed wind streams , as well as the magnetic sector structures are replicated well within a few days . for our purpose , differences of a few days are too large since the travel time of cmes to 1  au is of the same order ( @xmath1325 days ) .",
    "we derive the direction of motion and speed for each cme under study by exploiting the power of combining remote sensing and in situ observations , since for all events their arrival time and plasma characteristics at 1  au could be measured ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using a `` corrected '' hm method",
    "we infer the speed - distance information for that part of the cme that actually hit the spacecraft ( cf .",
    "rollett et al .",
    "2011 ; http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0300 ) . for each cme",
    "we extract the numerically calculated background solar wind speed along its trajectory and compare it to the derived cme evolution .",
    "two out of three events ( events  1 and  2 ) are slow cmes with speeds of the order of 350  km  s@xmath15 occurring during low solar activity .",
    "depending on the model used , mas+enlil or wsa+enlil , we obtain quite different distance ranges at which the cme speed gets adjusted to the ambient solar wind flow .",
    "applying results from mas+enlil for event  1 , the cme would reach the solar wind speed below 30  r@xmath0 , whereas from wsa+enlil at @xmath1370  r@xmath0 . according to the study of event  1 by @xcite",
    "there are no signatures of magnetic reconnection even during the very early phase of cme evolution close to the sun .",
    "this implies that no driving forces are acting on this particular cme and that it is pulled out by the solar wind from starting from the low corona .",
    "this interpretation is supported by observations revealing a continuous increase in cme speed within the cor1+cor2 fov matching the speed derived in the hi1 distance range .",
    "however , the inertia of the cme may cause a delay in the final adjustment .",
    "taking into account the uncertainties in the extracted solar wind speed from wsa+enlil and mas+enlil , the cme reaches the same speed as the ambient solar wind flow at a distance range 2070  r@xmath0 .    from observations within the cor1+cor2 fov , the cme speed of event  2 clearly decelerates below 30  r@xmath0",
    "this can be interpreted as evidence for a strongly acting drag force over that distance range ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "results from mas+enlil support this interpretation and the cme speed is most likely adjusted to the background solar wind before entering the hi1 fov .",
    "the increase of the cme speed at a distance of @xmath13150180  r@xmath0 seems to be related to an increase in the background solar wind speed beyond @xmath13100140  r@xmath0 revealed from both model runs ( mas+enlil and wsa+enlil ) rather than due to a propelling lorentz force .",
    "this provides further evidence that the cme is well embedded in the ambient solar wind flow during its propagation in ip space .",
    "event  3 is the first fast cme event of cycle 24 occurring during a period of enhanced solar activity .",
    "therefore it is more difficult to interpret from the observational as well as from the model side .",
    "the cme speed reveals a significant deceleration from @xmath131100  km  s@xmath15 down to @xmath13750  km  s@xmath15 within the cor2 fov and accelerates again up to @xmath131000  km  s@xmath15 at a distance of @xmath13110  r@xmath0 . to explain this behavior we propose a scenario where the cme runs into strong overlying magnetic fields acting as obstacle which drastically slows down the cme already close to the sun .",
    "taking into account the distribution of the ambient solar wind flow on a qualitative basis , enlil shows that the cme crosses a hss .",
    "most likely we observe a very weak drag in the low - density / high - speed flow of the hss where the lorentz force which is still driving the cme is more effective , leading to an increase in cme speed at large distances from the sun .",
    "as soon as the lorentz force weakens the drag force controls the further evolution of the cme . at 1  au",
    "the cme has a final speed of @xmath13800  km  s@xmath15 which is of the order of the maximum speed reported for hsss @xcite . in this particular event",
    ", the final adjustment of the cme speed to the ambient solar wind flow appears to happen beyond 1  au .",
    "the various existing conversion methods which are used to derive radial distances from elongations all have limitations , and we have to consider artifacts that might arise in the resulting cme kinematics . especially for the late propagation phase , hence for large elongations , the methods may reveal an ( artificial ) enhancement in speed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we stress that an acceleration of a slow cme far in ip space may as well be a physical effect , caused by an increase in the ambient solar wind flow ( e.g. , due to solar wind high speed streams ) . hence , the general assumption that cmes show constant speed at large distances from the sun may not be correct and depends on the characteristics of the cme and the background solar wind speed .",
    "this finding should be taken into account when using fitting routines for the conversion from elongation into radial distance which are based on the assumption of constant speed over the entire sun to 1  au range .    in combination with observations",
    ", enlil gives valuable information about the general structure of the background solar wind which enables us to interpret the observed cme kinematics over the ip space distance range .",
    "however , the uncertainty from the model outputs limits the significance of the results which would be needed for more accurate and quantitative studies ( e.g. , lorentz versus drag force studies and refined prediction of 1  au transit times ) .",
