    "far from its source , any freely propagating electromagnetic field can be considered to a good approximation as a plane wave , with its electric field lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "this simple observation is the root of the notion of polarization . at first glance",
    ", it may seem rather obvious how to translate such a concept into the realm of quantum optics .",
    "however , hurdles such as hidden polarization  @xcite , the fact that the poincar sphere is too small to accommodate states with excitation larger than one photon  @xcite , and the difficulties in defining polarization properties of two - photon entangled fields  @xcite , to cite only a few examples , show that the classical theory , mainly based on first - order polarization moments , is insufficient for quantized fields .    here",
    ", we outline a systematic method for polarization characterization of quantum fields .",
    "the method is based on a simple premise ; namely , that if we can predict the @xmath0th - order moment of the stokes operator in any direction on the poincar sphere , we know all there is to be known about the state polarization of this order  @xcite , including any correlations between the stokes operators .",
    "a tensor representation of the polarization information is based on such correlations .",
    "however , expressing the stokes moments as functions of the measurement directions gives a more compact representation and provides a natural visualization .",
    "the stokes profile representation also gives a relevant characterization for passive interferometry .",
    "our analysis below makes use of both representations .",
    "as a state s polarization properties do not require the full density matrix to be determined , it allows polarization tomography to be more easily performed than full quantum tomography @xcite . considering polarization tomography with ideal detection ,",
    "we show that the number of measurement directions can be made equal to the number of independent parameters .",
    "the remaining material of the article is organized as follows . after recalling the fundamentals on the quantum description of polarization in section  [ sec : background ] , we present our scheme for characterization of quantum polarization properties in section  [ sec : higherorder ] . in section  [ sec : tomography ] ,",
    "we consider how the necessary data can be obtained experimentally .",
    "we thus arrive at an efficient method , which is feasible for polarization tomography of few - photon states . in section  [ sec : menagerie ] , we apply our characterization to several classes of states .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the following , we consider monochromatic plane waves .",
    "such fields can be decomposed into two orthogonal transverse modes , such as the horizontally and vertically polarized modes . for highly focused beams or waves in a waveguide ,",
    "the plane - wave description is often inadequate , as the field is not longer transverse .",
    "it is our belief that the concepts discussed in this paper can also be extended to such non - plane waves , and several proposals have already appeared in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , we shall not discuss such generalizations here .    the classical theory for the polarization of plane waves",
    "was established by stokes already more than 150 years ago  @xcite .",
    "we shall build on his theory as the basis of our treatment will be the stokes operators , whose expectation values are the stokes parameters  @xcite . following the conventions used in the quantum theory of angular momentum  @xcite and in quantum optics  @xcite , we define the stokes operators as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation operators of the modes associated with horizontally and vertically oscillating fields , respectively . with this choice , the usual ordering of the stokes parameters",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 differs from that of the indices of the operators .",
    "however , as far as the theory below is concerned , we could just as well have associated any other pair of orthogonal polarization modes to these operators . that would only influence the interpretation of the theory and not the theory itself .    as the annihilation and creation operators obey the bosonic commutation relations @xmath8",
    "= \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}$ ] , for @xmath9 , the stokes operators satisfy the commutation relations of an su(2 ) algebra @xmath10 = i 2 \\ , \\varepsilon_{j k \\ell } \\hat{s}_{\\ell } \\ , , \\ ] ] where the latin indices run from 1 to 3 and @xmath11 is the fully antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "the noncommutability of these operators precludes the simultaneous exact measurement of the corresponding physical quantities .",
    "the variances @xmath12 are found to obey the uncertainty relation @xmath13 moreover , while the stokes operators are all hermitian , the noncommutability makes `` mixed , '' non - symmetric products ( such as @xmath14 ) non - hermitian , also precluding their direct measurement .",
    "the standard definition of the degree of polarization for a quantum state @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the stokes vector .",
    "note that only first - order moments of the stokes operators are used in this definition . in a more elaborated characterization ,",
    "the degree of polarization can be subdivided into excitation manifolds according to the total photon number @xmath19 .",
    "this makes physical sense because since the corresponding observable @xmath20 commutes with all the other stokes operators @xmath21 = 0 \\ , , \\ ] ] a complete set of simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath20 and any of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 does exist .",
    "in fact , the statistics of the latter three operators is usually determined by a set of wave plates , a polarizing beam splitter , and two photodetectors , giving ( in the ideal case ) information not only about @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24 , but simultaneously of @xmath20 .",
    "let us here take a quick look at excitation manifolds @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "one can readily convince oneself that any pure single - photon state @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 , i.e. , any such state is fully polarized according to the definition ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , for an arbitrary single - photon state @xmath29 , the degree of polarization is related to the purity @xmath30 according to @xmath31 however , this relation does not hold for other excitation manifolds .",
    "for example , any pure state in excitation manifold @xmath32 of the form  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are real numbers and @xmath36 , satisfies @xmath37 , which indicates that it is unpolarized .",
    "however , as we shall see below , these states have polarization structure ( they are not isotropic in the polarization sense ) and can not be regarded as unpolarized .",
    "in order to characterize the polarization properties of a state , we shall employ measurements of higher - order moments of the stokes operators .",
    "this is very close to the glauber correlation functions in quantum coherence theory  @xcite , and has common grounds with klyshko generalized coherence matrices  @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have used the central moments for higher - order polarization characterization . whereas the central moments may be preferred by some readers ,",
    "the raw moments used in the present work seem to allow for an easier and more systematic approach .",
    "as we have already discussed , one can perform a measurement of the total photon number without disturbing the measurement of any other stokes operator . in classical optics , this is tantamount to the fact that the state of polarization is independent of the intensity .",
    "this suggests that the polarization properties are given by @xmath38 .",
    "however , an ideal measurement of polarization provides some information about the total energy and vice versa .",
    "for example , an even ( odd ) measured eigenvalue of any of the observables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 implies an even ( odd ) total number of photons .",
    "also , determining the probability distribution for the total number of photons @xmath39 simultaneously sets bounds on the polarization properties in accordance with the inequalities ( [ uncertrelation ] ) .    taking these observations into account",
    ", we distinguish polarization properties for different numbers of photons , and let full polarization characterization refer to complete knowledge of the expectation values of all possible combinations of the stokes operators .",
    "the @xmath40th - order polarization information of a state @xmath15 is then given by @xmath39 and the expectation values of the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 denotes the normalized two - mode , @xmath19-photon state obtained by projecting @xmath15 onto the @xmath19th excitation manifold @xmath44 using the fock basis , the projector can thus be expressed as @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "for any given order @xmath40 and excitation manifold @xmath19 , the elements ( [ rthorderexpectationvalues ] ) form a cartesian tensor @xmath47 of rank @xmath40 . due to the hermiticity of the stokes operators , theses tensors",

    "complete polarization information of order @xmath58 is thus equivalent to complete polarization information of all orders @xmath59 .    using the relations ( [ stokop ] ) and ( [ ccrsu2 ] )",
    ", it is also straightforward to show that the polarization information carried by @xmath56 is equivalent to that contained in the set of generalized coherence matrices of orders @xmath60 ( @xmath59 ) , whose elements are of the form  @xcite @xmath61 . having complete polarization information of all orders about a state @xmath15 is therefore equivalent to knowing its block - diagonal projection  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath49 is given by ( [ rhon ] ) .",
    "this is the so called the polarization sector ( or polarization density matrix ) .",
    "the number of parameters characterizing a block - diagonal state limited to the excitation manifolds @xmath63 is @xmath64 in particular , when a state is limited to the manifolds @xmath65 , the number of parameters simplifies to @xmath66 for such a state , complete polarization information of order @xmath67 is sufficient to determine its block - diagonal projection ( [ brho ] ) .",
    "the general density matrix for a state with no more than @xmath67 photons is determined by @xmath68 independent real numbers .",
    "hence , the polarization share of this information quickly decreases with @xmath67 .",
    "we now turn to the question of how to characterize polarization properties experimentally .",
    "since our interest is limited to the information contained in the block - diagonal projection  ( [ brho ] ) , it is clear that we are not required to do full quantum state tomography  @xcite .",
    "as complete polarization information corresponds to doing quantum tomography of all @xmath19-photon hilbert spaces excited by the considered state , one can make use of the methods developed for finite - dimensional systems  @xcite . however , some recently proposed higher - order intensity measurements  @xcite seem to be closest related to the ones we present below",
    ".    we will assume ideal measurements and that the total photon number and its probability distribution @xmath39 can be determined .",
    "this is obviously a severe restriction apart from the lowest excitation manifolds .",
    "however , the situation where no information about the total photon number can be obtained is described by simply summing over the different manifolds as discussed in section  [ sec : polpropalone ] .",
    "below , we also treat the experimental determination of different moments of an observable as different measurements . in principle",
    ", each moment requires an infinite number of measurement runs in order to be determined exactly .",
    "this would also give us the full probability distribution of the eigenvalues and thus all the moments .",
    "however , for the vast majority of realistic probability distributions , a lower moment requires fewer runs to be accurately determined .",
    "the fact that the classical stokes parameters are easily determined experimentally makes them highly practical .",
    "also in quantum optics , the measurement setups corresponding to the fundamental stokes operators are simple .",
    "these setups are composed only by phase shifters , beam splitters and photon - number measurements .",
    "the effects of linear optical devices are described by su(2 ) transformations  @xcite , which can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are the euler angles . any such transformation can be easily realized using linear optics  @xcite and they are lossless , so they leave @xmath20 unaffected .",
    "let us now introduce the stokes operator in an arbitrary direction characterized by the unit vector @xmath73 as @xmath74 the effect of an arbitrary su(2 ) transformation on @xmath75 , can then be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the matrix describing a rotation of @xmath78 around the @xmath79-axis , e.g. @xmath80 .\\ ] ] hence , any su(2 ) transformation corresponds to a proper rotation in @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath24 , which gives the photon - number difference , is transformed according to @xmath82 that is , @xmath83 is the standard displacement on the sphere and the transformation parameters @xmath71 and @xmath70 equal the spherical coordinates of the vector @xmath84 characterizing the transformed stokes operator .",
    "we see that any @xmath75 is related to @xmath24 by an su(2 ) transformation corresponding to a polarization rotation of @xmath85 followed by a differential phase shift of @xmath86 .",
    "expectation values of the form @xmath87 can thus be straightforwardly determined experimentally .",
    "ideally , we can simultaneously measure the total photon number @xmath19 , so that also expectation values of the form @xmath88 can be determined .",
    "the tensor @xmath50 gives any expectation value of the form @xmath89 when all vectors are the same , ( [ generalsumovert ] ) simplifies considerably . for a given state , the relation between @xmath88 and the direction @xmath84 will be referred to as the @xmath19-photon stokes moment profile of order @xmath40 .",
    "these profiles can be expressed as @xmath90 where the moment component @xmath91 is the sum of all tensor elements of the form @xmath92 that have @xmath93 ones and @xmath94 twos as subscripts . due to ( [ rthorderexpectationvalues ] ) ,",
    "every moment component is thus the expectation value of the hermitian operator formed by the sum of the stokes - operator products corresponding to its tensor elements .",
    "the number of such elements is given by the trinomial coefficient @xmath95 for example , we have @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the sum of all tensor elements of order @xmath40 in excitation manifold @xmath19 can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "since the polarization tensor satisfies the hermiticity condition ( [ tensorhermiticity ] ) , the moment components are real , and consequently the real part of @xmath50 is sufficient to determine @xmath88 in any direction @xmath84 . naturally , knowing the stokes moment profile ( [ snrmean ] ) is equivalent to knowing the @xmath99 moment components @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , using the commutation relation ( [ ccrsu2 ] ) , it is possible to determine the differences between the tensor elements belonging to the same moment component @xmath91 from @xmath55 .",
    "since every element of @xmath50 belongs to such a moment component , it thus follows that @xmath55 together with all @xmath91 determine @xmath50 .",
    "let us now introduce a standard ordering of the stokes operators according to @xmath100 making repeated use of the commutation relation ( [ ccrsu2 ] ) , the moment components can then be expressed as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a sum over stokes - operator products of orders smaller than @xmath40 .",

    "using the basis @xmath114 , the density matrix of a general two - photon state can be written as @xmath115 the first- and second - order stokes moment profiles can then be expressed as @xmath116 + 2 \\ , ( 2 \\pi_1 +    \\pi_2 - 1 ) n_3 , \\\\    & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it is possible to determine all third - order moment components .",

    "however , the so - called hidden polarization of the @xmath188 states appears in the even - order stokes profiles . as @xmath197 , these profiles have common features with rotated ones for @xmath198 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that more elaborate measurements than those considered here are required to achieve heisenberg resolution when employing the @xmath188 states @xcite .      using the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion",
    ", one can straightforwardly generate two - mode squeezed vacuum states .",
    "these have thermal photon - pair distributions and take the form @xmath199 where @xmath182 denotes the average number of photons . from ( [ sumn ] ) , ( [ s2 mm ] ) and ( [ s4 mm ] ) , we thus get @xmath200     for the @xmath19-photon noon states with @xmath201 .",
    "dark and light surfaces indicate the directions for which @xmath202 takes positive and negative values , respectively . ]      finally , let us consider the noon states @xmath203 , where @xmath175 .",
    "these are in some sense optimal for interferometry  @xcite .",
    "their stokes moment profiles are found to be @xmath204 , & r \\ \\mathrm{even . }",
    "\\end{array } \\right .\\ ] ] we note that when @xmath40 is even and @xmath19 is odd , the effect of the second term within square brackets vanishes . for each of the first six noon states , we have plotted the stokes moment profile @xmath205 in figure  [ fig : noonplots ] . in the horizontal plane @xmath206",
    ", we have @xmath207 where the polynomial @xcite @xmath208 satisfies @xmath209 and the recurrence relation @xmath210 .",
    "hence , the de broglie wavelength of the noon states , which scales as @xmath211 and is the reason for their superiority  @xcite , can be seen in these measurements .",
    "let us now return to the pure two - photon states that satisfy @xmath129 .",
    "these are given in ( [ 2phunpol ] ) and are found to be related to the two - photon noon state by appropriate su(2 ) transformations according to @xmath212 hence , any stokes moment profile of the state @xmath213 is related to the corresponding noon profile by simple rotations . since @xmath214 , @xmath215 is obtained from @xmath216 in figure  [ fig : noonplots ] by applying a rotation of @xmath217 around @xmath218 followed by a rotation of @xmath35 around @xmath165 . since @xmath219 is independent of @xmath84 , the states @xmath220 lack first - order polarization structure .",
    "however , they do all have a second - order polarization structure .",
    "using expectation values of stokes - operator products , we have developed a systematic scheme for characterizing higher - order polarization properties of two - mode quantized fields .",
    "polarization tensors and stokes moment profiles were introduced as two representations of the polarization information .",
    "the latter show how passive interferometry affects the moments of photon difference .",
    "this viewpoint was taken as polarization properties of different states were compared .",
    "other possible representations of the polarization information include central moments @xcite , quasi - probability distributions @xcite and excitation - specific generalized coherence matrices .",
    "complete polarization characterization requires the excitation manifolds to be addressed separately . for situations where",
    "this can not be achieved , our characterization coincide with the one provided by klyshko s generalized coherence matrices @xcite .    assuming ideal photon - number resolving detectors",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to efficiently collect the data through stokes moment measurements in different directions . in an experiment",
    ", it may be more practical to use more measurement directions than the minimum required , but our method should serve as a guide . in particular , we expect the introduced moment components to be useful .",
    "another advantage of the described method is that it treats the stokes moments order by order .",
    "hence , if only the first few polarization orders are of interest , it makes the measurements easier .",
    "since the different excitation manifolds are treated separately , losses have drastic consequences in that higher excitation manifolds then contribute to the lower ones . furthermore , whereas linear losses often model imperfections of single - photon detectors well , photon - number resolving detectors , which are required for full polarization characterization , are more complex and may call for nonlinear modeling .    on the other hand , the separation of data into excitation manifolds and moment orders may be useful when developing methods for efficient determination of polarization characteristics . for example , one can take into account that all state projections @xmath49 in the different excitation manifolds must be physical states .",
    "in this way , it should be possible to develop efficient maximum likelihood methods similar to those regularly employed in common quantum tomography .    financial support from the swedish foundation for international cooperation in research and higher education ( stint ) , the swedish research council ( vr ) through its linnus center of excellence adopt and contract no .  621 - 2011 - 4575 , the conacyt ( grant no .",
