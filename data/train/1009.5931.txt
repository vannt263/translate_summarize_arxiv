    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the interplay between local ( two- and three - body ) and non - local interactions in low dimensional systems of ultracold dipolar bosons .",
    "we focus on a one dimensional geometry , and find that the phase diagram of such systems strongly resembles that of the spin-1 heisenberg model with ising - like and single ion anisotropy  @xcite , or @xmath0 model , extensively studied in the past in the contest of one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "we present numerical results on the phase diagram , which exhibits ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and hidden order phases , and finally discuss the stability of these phases in presence of a trapping potential and density fluctuations , as naturally present in cold atomic and molecular setups .",
    "several of the magnetic phases discussed do not require strong dipolar interactions , and can thus be observed even with magnetic atoms , where dipolar interaction is usually much smaller than any other relevant energy scale@xcite .",

    "dipolar bosons confined in a one dimensional geometry and subject to a deep optical lattice are generally described by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath2 here , @xmath3 are bosonic creation , annihilation and number operator at site @xmath4 , the first line describes the standard bose - hubbard model , where @xmath5 is the hopping term between nearest neighbor sites and @xmath6 the onsite interaction , and the last line includes trapping and long - distance dipolar potentials .",
    "the hopping coefficient @xmath5 varies with the depth of the underlying optical lattice , whereas @xmath7 can be tuned by varying the applied ec electric field ; finally , the onsite interaction @xmath6 depends on the short - distance details of the interparticle interaction@xcite and , for magnetic atoms , can be controlled by using feshbach resonances@xcite .",

    "however , the attractive regime @xmath11 has so far been neglected .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that losses given by strong three - body recombination are enhanced in this regime , thus making a time - dependent description of the system more suitable in order to take into account dissipative effects@xcite",
    ". the situation can be though strongly simplified when the decay rate @xmath12@xcite associated with three - body loss processes is much larger than the typical tunneling rate , i.e. @xmath13 : in this regime , a mechanism analogous to the quantum zeno effect gives rise to an effective strong three - body repulsion , which can be implemented in the hamiltonian with the additional condition @xmath14@xcite .",
    "the opportunity to engineer strong three - body repulsion has then two striking effects : _",
    "i ) _ the system is in general stable regardless of the sign of the couplings @xmath15 and _ ii ) _ the onsite hilbert space is reduced to @xmath16 , thus resembling a spin-1 system .",
    "this correspondence is further clarified after introducing spin-1 operators @xmath17 and performing the following mapping : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are fixed by commutation relations , as described in appendix [ app_map ] . from now on",

    "( [ hamspin ] ) is a generalization of the so called @xmath0 model@xcite , extensively studied over the last two decades both from analytical and numerical points of view .",
    "the spin-@xmath26 @xmath0 model presents a rich phase diagram : in addition to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases , in a broad region of the parameter space competition between local and non - local interactions favors the so - called _ haldane phase _ ( as expected for integer spin chains@xcite ) , which displays a gap in the energy spectrum , a unique ground state ( at least in the thermodynamic limit , whereas it is four - fold degenerate for chains of finite size ) , a finite correlation length , and thus no long - range order even if it is possible to define suitable string correlation functions that measure a hidden topological order .",
    "the spin liquid picture introduced by tasaki@xcite provides a intuitive understanding of the haldane phase : let us assign the presence of an effective spin-@xmath27 particle with spin pointing up ( down ) if at the @xmath4-th lattice site @xmath28 and no particles if @xmath29 .",
    "the haldane phase is then interpreted as a liquid in which these effective particles carry no positional order along the chain but still retain antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order in their effective spins .",
    "the positional disorder is associated with the absence of long - range order in the usual spin-1 correlation functions @xmath30 whereas the spin-@xmath27 magnetic order that we would get if all the sites with @xmath31 were taken off from the chain is measured by the asymptotic value of the string order parameters ( sop)@xcite : @xmath32 as shown thoroughly by kennedy and tasaki @xcite the @xmath0 model possesses an hidden ( non - local ) @xmath33 symmetry , and the non - vanishing values of the sop can be understood as the breaking of such a symmetry .",
