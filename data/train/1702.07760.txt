    "the breaking waves facilitate oil break - up and mixing throughout the water column , reaching the seabed .",
    "there is no denying about the importance of studying oil dispersion under breaking waves , such as understanding the ecological impact of oil spills , and supporting decision making .",
    "there are several challenges when simulating oil dispersion under breaking waves by a numerical model .",
    "one is that the model has to be able to consider multi - phase interactions involving interfacial surface tension effect .",
    "the other is that the numerical model should be able to robustly simulate the complicated 3d breaking waves .",
    "this work addresses this issue by using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) model gpusph , which has proven effective for simulating breaking waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and it has been recently improved to consider multi - phase interaction .    in terms of multi - phase sph models , there are several methods available in literature to preserve the multi - phase interface , where the density discontinuity and viscosity discontinuity exist .",
    "hu and adams @xcite proposed a multi - phase sph method from a particle smoothing function in which the neighboring particles only contribute to the specific volume but not density .",
    "their method is able to handle density discontinuity and also capable of considering multi - viscosity , multi - surface tension interaction .",
    "after their work , the specific volume approach for multi - phase modeling has been followed by several works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however , based on the experience of the authors of this study , it is tedious to implement the specific volume approach together with a moving boundary in a two - phase sph model .",
    "another straightforward approach is to directly solve the density as an unknown for multiple phases ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , this method is limited to a relatively small density ratio , and special attention is needed when the simulation involves a free surface boundary .    in this study , we analyze the behavior of oil under breaking waves by simulating a laboratory experiment conducted by li & katz  @xcite at johns hopkins university , by using a two - phase sph model . the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the governing equations of the two - phase sph method are introduced in section  [ governing_equations ] .",

    "the laboratory experimental setup of oil dispersion under breaking waves and the corresponding numerical setup are introduced in section  [ lab_model ] .",

    "monaghan  @xcite suggested to use a reduced speed of sound , which satisfies @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the maximum velocity in the simulation ) to avoid unphysical density fluctuation .      considering a single phase in the domain , the equation of continuity ( [ eq : cn ] ) is discretized by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the index of the particle of interest ; @xmath20 is the index of the neighboring particle of particle @xmath19 ; @xmath21 is the total number of neighboring particles of particle @xmath19 ; @xmath22 is the particle mass ; the velocity difference vector is defined by @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 is the gradient of the kernel function @xmath25 at particle @xmath19 .",

    "( [ eq : ct_dist_3 ] ) is necessary for simulations involving a free surface , otherwise , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ct_dist_2 ] ) is enough for handling a two - phase problem .",
    "the current two - phase formulation discretizes the pressure term in a symmetric way : @xmath30    the above discretization conserves both linear and angular momentums .    in the single - phase implementation of gpusph",
    ", the viscosity term is discretized by following lo and shao @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the laminar kinematic viscosity ; @xmath33 is a small number introduced to keep the denominator non - zero and usually equal to 0.1@xmath34 ( @xmath34 is the smoothing length ) .    for multiple phases",
    ", the viscous term can be discretized in two ways , depending on the used viscosity types .",
    "when the kinematic viscosity ( @xmath35 ) is used , one has @xmath36 on the other hand , discretization with the dynamic viscosity reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are viscosities in the form of the harmonic mean @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 for a single phase the harmonic mean viscosity recovers the single phase viscosity , and then eqs .

    "it should be noted that this study includes two types of fluids ( i.e. , water and oil ) , but only the property of water is assigned to the dynamic boundary particles , since our simulation does not involve the interaction between oil and the water tank wall .",

    "although there is a slight difference regarding the initial shape change between the oil cube and the oil sphere , eventually the initially cubic oil drop also becomes a similar flat - pan oil slick , as observed in the initially spherical oil drop case .",
    "it should be pointed out that although the two numerical experiments show that gpusph is able to predict realistic shape changes of oil drops rising through still water under the effect of buoyancy force , our future effort will be made to validate the capability of the model by comparing with laboratory measurements or analytical solutions .",

    "a 10 @xmath65 1 inch ( 25.4 @xmath65 2.54  cm ) oil slick was placed in the water surface by an oil confinement system just before the touch - down of the breaking wave .",
    "the center of the oil slick is about @xmath43 = 1.5  m and @xmath54 = 0.15  m , and the thickness of the oil slick is only about 0.5  mm .",
    "the measured interfacial surface tension coefficient of the crude oil is about 0.019  n / m . in the laboratory experiments ,",
    "the oil dispersion under a breaking wave was recorded by three cameras , which are denoted as 1 , 2 , and 3 from left to right in this study . in the following section , the numerical prediction of the two - phase model",
    "is compared with their laboratory images .    in gpusph ,",
    "the 6  m long tank length was fully reproduced , but the tank width ( 0.3 m ) was narrowed and a cross - tank periodic boundary condition was used to save computation cost .",
    "two particle sizes of 1  mm and 5  mm were used to discretize the wave tank , and there are four types of particles : the tank wall , the piston wavemaker , fluid ( water ) , and fluid ( oil ) . for the numerical wall boundary condition ,",
    "the dynamic boundary condition of dalrymple and knio @xcite was also used .",
    "the numerical simulations were carried out by running gpusph on 6 nvidia tesla c2050 gpus at the graphics processing lab cluster of johns hopkins university .",
    "two seconds physical time was considered ; the total number of particles ranges from 0.5 million to 20 million , and it took about several hours / several days to finish the simulations .",
    "[ fig : waveform ] shows the comparison of non - breaking wave form with the laboratory images for all three cameras . camera  1 is the nearest one to the wave maker , and",
    "camera  3 is the furthest one . for camera  1 , the first two frames ( @xmath2 = 0.4 and 0.6  s )",
    "show the comparison of the incoming wave before breaking , and the last frame ( @xmath2 = 1.0  s ) shows the comparison about the lee side of the broken wave . for camera  2 , the first frame ( @xmath2 = 0.8  s ) shows comparison of the arrival of wave , and the last two frames ( @xmath2 = 1.4 and 1.7  s ) show comparison of the passing of the broken wave .",

    "it is seen that gpusph accurately predicts the pre - breaking and post - breaking wave profiles as recorded by all three cameras in the laboratory .",
    "however , there are also discrepancies observed between the numerical prediction and the laboratory record . for the oil distribution , although good agreements are obtained before the wave breaks ( e.g. , the first two frames of camera  1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : waveform ] ) , there is a clear mismatch of the submerged oil dispersion after the wave breaks ( e.g. , the last two frames in both cameras  2 and 3 as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : wavebreaking ] shows the comparison of the breaking wave profiles and the corresponding oil distribution in cameras  2 and 3 .",
    "it is seen that the breaking portion of the wave in the laboratory is not the same as produced by gpusph nor is the distribution of oil within the water column .",
    "there are several possible causes for the mismatch of the simulated oil distribution with that recorded in the laboratory .",
    "one is related to the numerical setup . due to the relatively thin oil slick in the laboratory",
    ", the numerical model has to use a fine particle size ; however , a particle size such as 1  mm is still much larger than the oil droplet size after the oil break - up .",
    "furthermore , the wave breaking is a 3d process in the laboratory , but the high computation cost caused by the fine particle size in the numerical simulation prevents the model to consider the full width of the tank , therefore , the breaking wave profile might not be correctly captured by the numerical model .",
    "last but not the least , the oil distribution is significantly influenced by the breaking wave , but the breaking wave is a chaotic process in nature .",
    "[ fig : lab_wave ] shows the comparison of recorded breaking waves and oil dispersion at the same instant among 3 runs with the same initial laboratory setup , it is seen that the breaking wave and oil dispersion could not even be reproduced in the laboratory .",
    "similarly it is not likely that our numerical prediction ( even with a fully resolved oil slick thickness by using a very fine particle size in the simulation ) could match the breaking wave and the recorded oil dispersion perfectly .",
    "therefore , we can only expect a qualitatively similar result at best .",
    "the study has developed a two - phase sph model based on a single - phase sph model gpusph , and further applied it to investigate oil dispersion under breaking waves .",
    "major work and findings include :    * the two - phase sph model solves one set of governing equations for both phases .",
    "particles only contribute their volumes in the continuity equation , and renormalization is conducted to preserve density near a free surface .",
    "a numerical surface tension model was implemented to take into account the interfacial surface tension effect between two phases ; * two numerical examples were carried out to evaluate the model s capability of modeling oil - water interaction .",
    "numerical predictions show realistic shape changes as oil drops rising through still water .",
    "however , further model validations with laboratory experiments are needed ; * the two - phase sph model was then applied to replicate a laboratory experiment on oil dispersion under breaking waves .",
    "it is seen that it is able to reproduce well the pre- & post - breaking wave as recorded in the laboratory ; * oil dispersion predicted by the two - phase sph model only matches part of the laboratory observation .",
    "several factors ( e.g. , 3d & chaotic nature of breaking waves , numerical setup ) cause the discrepancy .",
