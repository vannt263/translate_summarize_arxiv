    "quantum entanglement is one of the potential sources of quantum theory .",
    "it plays a vital role and works as a major resource for quantum communication and computation @xcite .",
    "unveiling various aspects of quantum entanglement has been a strenuous exercise for the last few decades .",
    "it is frequently used in constructing many protocols , such as teleportation of unknown states @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . completely isolating a quantum system from its environment",
    "is plainly an impossible task .",
    "it is , thus , necessary to investigate the behavior of initial state entanglement in the presence of environmental effects .",
    "the inevitable coupling between an environment and a quantum system leads to the phenomenon of decoherence and it gives rise to an irreversible transfer of information from the system to the environment @xcite .",
    "yu and eberly @xcite showed that entanglement loss occurs in a finite time under the action of pure vacuum noise in a bipartite state of qubits .",
    "they found that , even though it takes infinite time to complete decoherence locally , the global entanglement may be lost in finite time .",
    "this phenomenon of sudden loss of entanglement has been named as `` entanglement sudden death '' ( esd ) .",
    "the finite time loss of entanglement definitely limits the application of entangled states in quantum information processing .",
    "the phenomenon of esd is not limited only to two qubit entangled states , it is investigated in systems of larger spaces such as qutrits and qudits @xcite .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the effect of esd is given in ref .",
    "the experimental evidences of the phenomenon of esd have been reported for optical setups @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "quantum states are grouped into separable and entangled states for qubit - qubit and qubit - qutrit system by using peres - horodecki criterion peres , horodecki1 , nevertheless , such characterization for higher dimensional bipartite states is difficult @xcite . according to this criterion , the partial transpose of a separable density matrix must have non - negative eigenvalues . for a nonseparable state , the degree of entanglement is quantified by the negativity , which is given by the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix .",
    "in this paper i study the behavior of entanglement of a hybrid qubit - qutrit system in the presence of depolarizing noise . the individual qubit and qutrit states of the system , i consider , are incoherent but the composite system may still possess coherence and entanglement . for detailed study of the properties of such systems ,",
    "i refer the readers to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors showed the existence of esd in such composite systems under the influence of dephasing noise .",
    "i consider various coupling of the system and environment in which the system is influenced by global , collective , local , or multilocal depolarizing noise .",
    "i show that although esd occurs only in certain states under particular situations for various coupling of the system and environment , however , it can be controlled and completely avoided if certain measurement are taken .",
    "for example , under the action of multilocal and global noise , all the states avoid esd if one or the other environment is controlled .",
    "furthermore , i show that the degree of entanglement regrows for all states in the range of large values of decoherence parameters .      i consider a composite system of a qubit a and a qutrit b that are coupled to a noisy environment both collectively and individually .",
    "the collective coupling refers to the situation when both the qubit and qutrit are influenced by the same environment , whereas the local and multilocal coupling describes the situation when the qubit and qutrit are independently influenced by its own environment .",
    "the system is said to be coupled to a global environment when it is influenced by both collective and multilocal noises at the same time .",
    "let the bases of hilbert space of the qubit be denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 and that of the qutrit by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the kraus operators for a single qutrit depolarizing noise are given as @xcite@xmath7with    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the identity matrix of order @xmath11 .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath12 $ ] is the decoherence parameter .",
    "the lower and upper limits of @xmath13 stand , respectively , for undecohered and fully decohered cases of the noisy environment .",
    "the kraus operators for both qubit and qutrit satisfy the completeness relation @xmath14 .",
    "the evolution of the initial density matrix of the system when it is influenced by the global depolarizing noise is given in the kraus operators formalism as follow@xmath15where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the kraus operators of the multilocal coupling of qubit and qutrit individually and @xmath18 are the kraus operators of the collective coupling that are formed from the tensor product of the kraus operators of a single qubit and a single qutrit depolarizing noise in the form @xmath19 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath20 , and @xmath21 stand for a single qubit and a single qutrit kraus operators of a depolarizing noise .",
    "the initial density matrix @xmath22 of the composite system is given by the following one parameter family of matrices@xmath23where @xmath24 .",
    "for this range of values of @xmath25 , all the eigenvalues are positive and the matrix is a well - defined density matrix .",
    "the partial transpose criterion for this matrix shows that in the specified range of @xmath25 , it is entangled ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using initial density matrix of eq . (",
    "[ 4 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and taking the partial transpose over the qubit , it is easy to find the eigenvalues . let the decoherence parameters for local noise of the qubit and qutrit and collective noise of the composite system be @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath13 respectively . then , the eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the final density matrix when only the qubit is coupled to the noisy environment are given by@xmath28    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the behavior of negativity as a function of @xmath13 for various values of @xmath25 is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the figure that esd can be completely avoided under the action of global environment for the chosen values of multilocal decoherence parameters .",
    "however , this is not true for all values of multilocal decoherence parameters .",
    "for example , for @xmath29 , some density matrices in the range of large values of @xmath25 exhibit esd .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath30 , the negativity becomes independent of @xmath25 and all the state respond equally to @xmath13 .",
    "i study the dynamics of entanglement for certain hybrid qubit - qutrit states under global , collective , local and multilocal depolarizing noise .",
    "i show that unlike the case of dephasing noise @xcite , the influence of depolarizing noise is different for different coupling of the system and the environment . using partial transpose criterion for quantifying entanglement",
    ", it is shown that not all but only certain initially entangled density matrices exhibit esd in depolarizing noise in the range of lower values of decoherence parameter under particular coupling .",
    "no esd in any density matrix occurs when only the qubit is coupled to its local environment .",
    "the only density matrices that corresponds to higher values of @xmath25 exhibit esd when only the qutrit is coupled to its local environment .",
    "the conjecture made in ref .",
    "@xcite that esd is a generic phenomenon to occur in all bipartite quantum system is not correct . for every density matrix that undergoes esd at a particular value of decoherence parameter ,",
    "the re - birth of entanglement occurs at values higher than that particular value of decoherence parameter .",
    "the degree of entanglement increases for large values of decoherence parameter for all states under every possible coupling of the system and the environment considered here . a critical point , at which all the states has equal degree of entanglement , is observed .",
    "it is shown that in the case of only qutrit - environment s coupling the decrease in negativity occurs faster in certain density matrices as compared to only the qubit - environment s coupling .",
    "the entanglement sudden death happens only in the intermediate values of @xmath25 under the action of collective noise .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the esd can be completely avoided under certain situations when the system is under the action of multilocal and global noise ."
