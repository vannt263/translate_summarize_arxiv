    "qed in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions exhibits both dynamical mass generation  @xcite and confinement  @xcite .",
    "this makes it an interesting theory to study these nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "furthermore , these phenomena in qed@xmath0 are relevant for applications in condensed matter physics , in particular in connection with high-@xmath1 superconductivity  @xcite . here , we focus on the question of chiral symmetry breaking in qed@xmath0 .",
    "we use staggered fermions , and perform simulations with explicit dynamical fermions in the chiral limit . simulations with explicit fermions could improve our understanding of the microscopic behavior of ( chiral ) fermions in lattice simulations .",
    "we apply a recently developed method  @xcite , called the `` zone method '' , to reduce the fermion sign problem in our simulation .",
    "preliminary results for the chiral condensate in qed@xmath0 are in agreement with other methods .",
    "qed@xmath0 is a superrenormalizable theory , with a dimensionful coupling : @xmath2 has dimensions of mass .",
    "this dimensionful parameter plays a role similar to @xmath3 in qcd . in the chiral limit",
    ", it sets the energy scale .",
    "we use 4-component spinors , such that the fermion mass term is even under parity . with one massless fermion ,",
    "the hamiltonian exhibits a global @xmath4 `` chiral '' symmetry .",
    "a fermion mass term breaks this symmetry to a @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the question is : is this chiral symmetry broken dynamically ?",
    "the order parameter for this symmetry breaking is the chiral condensate .",
    "there are extensive studies using the dyson ",
    "schwinger equations  @xcite suggesting that there is dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qed@xmath0 if the number of fermion flavors is smaller than some critical number @xmath6 . however , the scale of this symmetry breaking ( i.e. the magnitude of the condensate ) is rather small .      following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the lattice hamiltonian in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the usual plaquette operator .",
    "we use a dimensionless mass parameter @xmath13 and a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the continuum limit corresponds to @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "we use staggered fermions , corresponding to one 4-component fermion flavor in the continuum limit  @xcite . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the lattice breaks the `` chiral '' @xmath4 symmetry to a discrete symmetry generated by a shift of one lattice spacing .",
    "a nonzero mass term breaks this discrete symmetry . to study chiral symmetry breaking on the lattice",
    ", we calculate the lattice condensate @xmath19 in the chiral limit as function of the lattice coupling @xmath20 .",
    "it is related to the continuum condensate @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "we use a finite spatial grid , @xmath23 , and calculate observables @xmath24 by dividing the euclidean time variable @xmath25 in @xmath26 slices , and inserting a complete set of states between the time slices .",
    "we choose a tensor product basis of gauge and fermion states .",
    "we use a standard metropolis algorithm to update the gauge field configurations .    for the fermions we use the worldline formalism  @xcite , in combination with the loop algorithm  @xcite to update the fermion configurations .",
    "as initial / final states we choose the strong coupling ( @xmath27 ) ground state .",
    "the initial and final fermion states are identical , up to permutations of fermions .",
    "numerically , these permutations of course give rise to the fermion sign problem . with the worldline formalism",
    "we can keep track of the permutations , and we use the newly developed _ zone method _",
    "@xcite to reduce the sign problem .",
    "the basic idea  @xcite is to introduce an @xmath28 spatial sub - lattice ( with @xmath29 ) , which we call a _",
    "zone _ , for the fermion simulations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : zone ] .",
    "next , we allow for permutations of initial and final state fermions _ inside this zone _ only .",
    "illustration of the zone method : an @xmath30 spatial lattice with a @xmath31 zone .",
    "the size of this zone is 17 , as characterized by the number of links inside the sub - lattice.,width=207 ]    we do not allow for any configuration with fermion permutations outside the @xmath28 spatial sub - lattice .",
    "note that at intermediate time slices the fermions are still allowed to wander through the entire @xmath23 lattice . in order to further reduce the fermion sign problem , we also use a larger value of the coupling @xmath32 and a larger value of the fermion mass @xmath33 when the fermions are outside this zone .",
    "it turns out that observables scale linearly in the zone size , provided that this zone size is larger than the characteristic `` fermion wandering length '' @xcite . for any finite values of the coupling @xmath20 and of the time variable @xmath25",
    ", this wandering length is finite , even for massless fermions .",
    "thus one can extrapolate the results from relatively small zones to the entire lattice .",
    "there are different ways to define the size of a zone : by number of lattice points or by the number of links inside the zone . for large lattices",
    "it does not matter which one one chooses .",
    "however , for the relatively small lattices we have used sofar , it turns out that the best way to characterize the zone size is the _ number of links _ inside the zone .     numerical results for different zone sizes within a @xmath34 lattice , for fixed values of @xmath35 , @xmath18 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the total number of links in the lattice is 72 , where the three linear fits meet ( within error bars).,width=283 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] we show that , within error bars , the chiral condensate indeed behaves linearly in the number of links inside the fermion zone , even for the smallest zones ( at least for these parameter values ) .",
    "thus we can use a linear extrapolation to obtain the lattice condensate for the entire lattice , using three or four different zone sizes .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] we show our results for a range of values of the coupling @xmath20 .",
    "these results are obtained on lattices up to @xmath38 using several different zone sizes and for finite values of @xmath25 .",
    "the error bars are statistical error bars only .",
    "we expect the finite size effects due to the spatial lattice to be smaller than these error bars ; however , preliminary results indicate the @xmath39 extrapolation could lead to a reduction by about 10% .",
    "we are currently working on estimating the finite size effects in more detail  @xcite .    for @xmath40 these results",
    "agree quite well with the strong coupling expansion  @xcite , whereas the strong decrease with increasing @xmath20 for @xmath41 is in good agreement with euclidean monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear yet whether or not the condensate obtained this way is small or exactly zero in the continuum limit , @xmath16 .",
