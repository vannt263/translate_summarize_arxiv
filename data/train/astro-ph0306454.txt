    "of the reactions involved the solar combustion , namely d + p @xmath0 + @xmath1 , + @xmath0 2p + @xmath2 , and + @xmath2 @xmath0 + @xmath1 , we have focused on the cross section measurement of the + reaction at an effective energy of e@xmath3=30 - 50 kev . among many experimental works , the only experiment which has been conducted in or lower than the gamow energy is the + @xmath0 2p + @xmath2 reaction at the luna in gran sasso laboratory @xcite .",
    "the latter was performed near the gamow energy without measurement at e@xmath3=25 - 45 kev due to accelerator limitations that lower voltage could not be applied with a high voltage static accelerator while higher voltage more than 50 kv could be impossible at the luna . for a wider energy range e@xmath3=17.9 to 342.5 kev , the experiments done by krauss et al slightly extended the data over this energy gap @xcite . for the nuclear astrophysics discussion , in particular ,",
    "standard solar model or nucleo - systhesis continuous data down to low energy is crucial to deduce the astrophysical s - factor , s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , successive and precise data from around 50 kev to 20 kev center of mass energy are needed . for this purpose",
    ", we have constructed a low energy and compact accelerator facility which provides doubly charged ions for the measurement in the region between 50 kev to 25 kev and also singly charged ions in the region less than 25 kev center of mass energy .",
    "this is the first report of a series experiments done at our low - energy high current accelerator facility , ocean .",
    "we obtained precise results from 45.3 to 31.2 kev in center of mass energy for the + @xmath02p+@xmath2 reaction with a doubly charged incident beam .",
    "it has the substantial advantage of eliminating the molecular interference in the proton spectra by the + d reaction caused by the incident hd@xmath5 beam .",
    "the experimental apparatus , ocean ( osaka university cosmological experimental apparatus for nuclear physics ) consists of : ( 1 ) a powerful ion source that provides an intense current of more than 1 ma for @xmath6 ions at incident energies of 30 - 50 kev , or 200 @xmath7a for @xmath8 at incident energies of 90.6 to 62.4 kev .",
    "( 2 ) low energy beam transport with good transmission , ( 3 ) a windowless gas target and recirculation / purification system , ( 4 ) a reliable calorimeter , ( 5 ) detectors for reaction identification , and ( 6 ) an electronics and data acquisition system based on camac .",
    "the layout of the ocean is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "an intense ion source that can produce @xmath8 ions is essential for the present study .",
    "the nanogun@xmath9 , which was obtained from pantech , confines high - temperature electrons produced by the electron cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) and is assembled into an ecr ion source with 10 ghz , 200 watt rf generator ( model vzx-6383g5 , cpi ) .",
    "the original nanogun ecr ion source made by pantech can provide 40 @xmath7a for @xmath10 at 20 kv extraction voltage with an rf power of 60 w. from these data we could easily foresee the possibilities of obtaining @xmath6 or @xmath8 ion beams of more than 100 @xmath7a , although an applied potential to the extraction is not enough to use this ion source for astrophysical applications in a wider enery range . for this purpose , we redesigned the ion source extraction system to meet the ion optical condition for the present window - less gas target .",
    "leroy et al . reported an improvement for the analyzed current and beam emittance of @xmath6 beam by the a system called multielectrodes extraction for caprice - type ecr ion source .",
    "it supplied with an analysed current of 2.3 ma of @xmath6 giving a transmission of more than 75 % in the beam line @xcite .",
    "did you also do this ) . based on several experimental studies and computer simulations we designed and applied a two - electrode extraction system for the nanogun ecr ion source @xcite",
    "this improves the beam emittance under the influence of a strong space charge force , and secondly , it moderates the electric field gradient ascribed to high operational voltage .",
    "the optimization process for applying a suitable voltage to the intermediate electrode progressed considerably during experiments measured at each center of mass energy .",
    "for the present experiment between 45 kev and 31.2 kev center of mass energy , around 100 @xmath7a of double charged beam could pass through the three stages collimators to the gas target .",
    "a specially designed ceramic insulator ( sumikin ceramic co - ltd ) with two folds on the surface could support up to 50 kv potential without any surface discharge at a distance of 170 mm from the surface .",
    "we fabricated conic type and straight type extraction electrodes .",
    "it consists of a beam forming electrode which has a long straight part similar to the original nanogun s design and a conic structure for the beam forming electrode nearly parallel to the end surface of the plasma chamber .",
    "the performance and design have been described in previous papers @xcite .",
    "the low energy beam transport system between the ecr ion source and the gas target achieved a high beam intensity and other desirable beam qualities , thereby allowing for precision measurements of the present + @xmath02p+@xmath2 experiment .",
    "generally , it is known that there a strong space charge effect in the beam transport at ion currents of more than 1 ma .",
    "it is essential that this effect is accounted for when calculating the beam optics .",
    "we used a gios code developed by wollnick et al . for incorporating this effect @xcite .",
    "we adopted the d ( dipole , 90-degree deflection angle ) + q + q transport scheme for our system since it is easier to operate fewer elements . in this calculation",
    "we assumed a beam source of 100 @xmath11 mm mrad and 5 mm in diameter . despite the variance in total potential of the beam , a nearly invariant beam form",
    "could be realized at the source exit using the extraction system stated before . to maintain the minimum slit aperture",
    ", we calculated the dimension of the beam at the target position by varying the various parameters of elements and drift lengths so as to achieve smaller @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "very attractive results such as a constant @xmath12 and @xmath13 and a nearly parallel beam form are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gios ] .",
    "the beam transmission efficiency from the ion source through the target is about 30 % ( table [ tab : is2target ] ) .",
    "the window - less gas target for the study of the + reaction consists of a differential pumping and gas circulation / purification system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circulation ] .    in order to maintain a pressure of 1 mbar in the chamber of the gas target without window .",
    "the pumping system should be composed of several stages between the target chamber and beam transport system .",
    "thus we prepared a helical groove vacuum pump ( model ts-440 , osaka vacuum co.ltd ts-440 ) as the main pump for evacuating the gas flow at the viscose region as well as at the higher vacuum region .",
    "the sizes of collimators at every stage were estimated by calculation in order to maintain a pressure of about 0.3 torr in the target chamber . during the experiment , the pressure in the target chamber was maintained at 3.1(@xmath140.1 ) torr for about four days .",
    "the recirculation system consists of a helium tight pump , an oil free diaphragm membrane compressor , reserver vessels , compound gauges , ultra fine regulated valves and a quadruple mass spectrometer as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circulation ] . since all evacuation pumps connected to the helical pump , a gas dosing system has been employed in order to maintain a constant target pressure to evacuate the input gas amount at the ion source . because during experiments , gas injection into the ecr ion source had the effect of gradually increasing the target pressure .",
    "thus , a constant target pressure was maintained by controlling the signal from the capacitance manometer ( barocel-655 ) located at the target chamber with a gas dosing apparatus ( model evr 116 and rvc 300 controller ) .",
    "the new purification system developed for the present experiment is quite different from the usual method .",
    "it exploits a cryo - pump ( model u-140w , daikin ) as a purifier without a special absorbent and liquid nitrogen , although high heat input could be expected at the high operating pressure",
    ". this has been overcome by adding another oil free turbo - molecular pump ( model a30fc , anelva ) between the cryo - pump and the target chamber . as pointed out by a. krauss et al .",
    "@xcite , the deuterium contamination both in the target and the beam , resulting from the water vapor , is a crucial problem for obtaining low energy data , since the d + reaction cross section is six orders of magnitude higher than that of the + reaction . in the case of @xmath8 beam",
    "( e / m=2/3 ) , we can avoid molecular interference of the hd@xmath5 beam ( e / m=1/3 ) , with analyzer magnet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] ) contaminating the incident @xmath6 ( e / m=1/3 ) beam , whereas this could not be avoided if we had employed a single charged beam ( e / m=1/3 ) , we have measured the deuterium contamination in commercial gas by detecting hd@xmath5 separately via accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) .",
    "the experiment was carried out using the rcnp k=140 avf cyclotron .",
    "the cyclotron accelerator and the neomafios ecr ( neomafios ) ion source were operated only for the experiment on the beam injection line at an anex leading to the post accelerator ( rcnp ring cyclotron ) .",
    "the present result is hd@xmath5/ = ( 3.82@xmath140.69)@xmath1510@xmath16 .",
    "it is noticed that even if an ecr ion source uses electrons with higher energy than that of a duo - plasmatron ion source there is a considerable amount of hd@xmath5 production from the surface of the ion source and from the bottle of gas .",
    "deuteron contamination in the target was also estimated during operation of the recirculation and purification system .",
    "then the pressure at the target chamber was 1.2@xmath1510@xmath17 torr , and 7.6@xmath1510@xmath18 torr at the helical pump .",
    "the h@xmath19o component in the residual gas was measured by means of a quadrupole mass spectrometer , to be about 20 % .",
    "assuming that the amount of h@xmath19o at the target gas is the same as the residual gas , and the deuteron abundance is the same as the natural abundance ( 0.014 % ) , we can deduce that the deuteron contamination ( d@xmath19o ) is in the order of ppm .",
    "this is satisfactory for the present measurement as will discussed later .",
    "in addition , the amount of deuterium contamination in the target gas was also evaluated by means of the + experiment , by detecting the 14.7 mev proton , and was found to be about 0.1 ppm .",
    "a calorimetric device has been developed to measure the projectile flux in the present experiment , since the conventional method of charge integrating to determine the number of incident particles is not applicable due to the neutralization of the incident charged particles with the gaseous target .",
    "many types of calorimeters have been developed @xcite .",
    "there are two types of calorimeters .",
    "one type measures the temperature difference between two parts thermally isolated with large heat resistance material .",
    "the other type measures the power needed to stabilize the temperature of water used to cool the calorimeter cup which is bombarded with energetic particles .",
    "we developed the calorimeter by using a heat flux sensor with an accuracy of better than 5 % in the dynamical range of 1 - 30 watts @xcite .",
    "the structure of calorimeter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calorimeter ] .",
    "it consists of a solid copper heat sink ( 100 mm length , 38 mm diameter ) with water channels , and a faraday cup ( 140 mm length , 38 mm diameter , 1.5 mm wall thickness ) in front of the heat sink .",
    "the faraday cup is supported by a pyrex glass insulator as well as a metal flange with a teflon gasket .",
    "this organic gasket served as a vacuum seal as well as an electric insulator .",
    "therefore , this calorimeter can also measure the number of incident particles , when the target chamber is in vacuum , by an electrical method . at the entrance of the cup ,",
    "a secondary electron suppressor is installed . around 100 volt",
    "was applied to the suppressor for the current measurement .    after passing through the window - less gas target ,",
    "the incident @xmath6 and @xmath8 beam is neutralized and captured in a faraday cup and calorimeter . in order to be applicable to a wide current range , a heat flux sensor ( hfs ) ( omega hfs-3 ) was used to measure the heat transfer from the hot part to the cold part .",
    "the hfs is a thermister bolometer which can measure the heat flux to or from a surface with minimum disturbance of the exiting heat flow . in this method ,",
    "a self - generating thermopile is arranged around a thin thermal barrier to produce a voltage that is a function of the thermal energy passing through the sensor .",
    "the response of the sensor to the thermal energy input is 1.10 to 1.11 mv / w / m@xmath20 . for precise measurements of the heat transfer ,",
    "we made use of the following procedures : 1 ) in vacuum , the current of the ion beam can be measured by standard charge integration where the calorimeter cup serves as a faraday cup .",
    "2 ) to reduce the conduction and convection losses , the heat capacity of the calorimeter should be reduced by as much as possible in order to get a better time response . with the present heat flux sensor , temperature differences of less than 0.001",
    "@xmath21c can be detected easily .",
    "therefore , the temperature of the heat sink of the calorimeter should be stabilized to better than 0.1 @xmath21c with heat exchange . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calorimeter ] , between the copper base and the thin plate of the calorimeter , two heat flux sensors are sandwiched with thermister temperature sensors .",
    "these are originally insulated electrically .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calorimeter ] , termister temperature sensors are also located to measure the temperature of the ambient or faraday cup base and the cooled heat sink .",
    "these are installed in a stainless steel pipe ( 40 mm length , 10.5 cm diameter ) , which can be evacuated by a small turbo - molecular pump .",
    "the calorimeter was tested by using a @xmath8 beam of energy of 40 kv .",
    "the relation between beam current(i ) and heat flux(h ) can be written as , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the temperature of the calorimeter and @xmath24 is the heat capacitance .",
    "the term @xmath25 shows that the temperature of the calorimeter depends on the incident beam current .",
    "thus , if the intensity i is changed , the converted heat is used to heat the calorimeter and is also transferred to the cold base .     since the transferred heat may approximated to be proportinal to the temperature difference between the the front and cold base , the second term in equation [ eq : a ] @xmath26 can be rewritten as @xmath27 .",
    "thus , equation ( 1 ) can be written as , @xmath28    in order to determine the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 , an experiment was carried out with a @xmath8 beam of 40 kev ( e@xmath3 ) .",
    "the beam current was calculated from the hfs output by comparison with the faraday cup measurements .",
    "the hfs output was measured by a keythley 2000 multimeter .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 were determined as follows : + 1 ) parameter @xmath29 : if the system is stable , that is , incident beam @xmath31 and temperature @xmath23 are stable , the second term of eq .",

    "+ 2 ) parameter @xmath30 : this papameter can be determined once parameter @xmath29 is known , as seen in eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "the term @xmath32 was measured for averaged time scales of 3 , 7 , 15 , and 30 s. it was found that the scale of 30 s was appropriate .",
    "[ fig : k2](b ) shows @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "+ 3 ) comparison with beam current : fig . [",
    "fig : fandh ] shows the beam current as a function of time measured using a faraday cup , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 with different beam conditions , i.e. , stable , slowly increasing , and decreasing beam current .",
    "the calculated currents measured with the hfs reproduce the measurements with the faraday cup as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fandh](a ) to [ fig : fandh](c ) . on the other hand , if the beam current is suddenly changed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fandh](d ) , the calculated currents from the hfs output overestimate the value measured by the hfs . further improvements of this system are necessary .",
    "fortunately , this case should not be a fatal problem for an astrophysical experiment with long term measurement times of typically one day or one month , since this occurs rarely , at most one or two times in a day .",
    "thus , in the experiment , the error caused by this overestimate can be neglected .",
    "the reproducibility of the beam current determined from the hfs output was verified for several beam energies .",
    "measurements were carried out on @xmath8 beam at incident kinetic energies of 35 , 30 , 25 , and 20 kev .",
    "the beam currents were calibrated using the parameters determined with the 40 kev beam .",
    "[ fig : accu-4 ] shows the accuracy of the calculated beam current in the form of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the beam currents measured by the hfs and the faraday cup ( fc ) , respectively .",
    "the accuracy was better than 2 % for the measured energies .",
    "the heat transferred through hfs can be calculated from the calibration parameter of hfs ( omega hfs3 : 1.10 @xmath39 1.11 @xmath7v / w / m@xmath40 at 70 @xmath21f ) . also",
    "the kinetic energy of incident particles can be calculated from the charge integration .",
    "table [ tab : heattrs ] shows the results of these calculations .",
    "it was found that in the equilibrium state most of the heat is transferred through the hfs .",
    "because of the different vacuum conditions during the calibration ( @xmath3910@xmath41 torr ) and during the experiment ( 0.1 torr ) , the effects of convection heat losses by the flowing gas in the target chamber have to be estimated .",
    "the heat transmission by convection was measured by comparing the transferred heat through the hfs for the two conditions of vacuum ( 10@xmath41 torr and 0.1 torr ) in the target chamber .",
    "the temperature of cool base was 30 @xmath21c .",
    "the difference of hfs output was 0.04 w corresponding to about 1.7 % for a 35 kev 100 @xmath7a beam .      in order to ensure a large detection efficiency and a clear discrimination of real events , we exploit four de - e counter telescopes by using semiconductor detectors for the measurement of the ( , 2p ) reaction .",
    "these detectors are installed into the target chamber filled with gas and are capable of identifying the + reaction ( q = 12.86 mev ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] .",
    "the reaction generates two protons which have kinetic energies of 0 to 10.7 mev , and an alpha particle which has kinetic energies of 0 to 4.3 mev .",
    "the de and e detectors in each telescope have an active area 2500 mm@xmath20 , the de detector has a thickness of 140 @xmath7 m and the e detector has a thickness of 1500 @xmath7 m ( micron ltd . ) .    to stop the generated alpha , photons and elastically scattered from the beam ,",
    "an aluminized mylar films with thickness of 25 @xmath7 m are located in front of all de counters .",
    "the distance between the de - counter or e counter and the beam axis is 32.5 mm and 37.1 mm , respectively .",
    "these detectors are fixed to a cylindrical and four faced base of oxygen free high conductive copper ( ofhc ) .",
    "it is helpful to avoid microphonic noise and natural background .",
    "analog signals from each detector are fed into preamplifiers ( model 142ih , ortec , for de counters model 142b , ortec , for e - counter ) with inorganic coaxial cables ( cu - s5ess-05 dipsol chemical co.,ltd . ) .",
    "since a shorter distance between the detector and preamplifier is desirable to reduce electrical noise , the distance is 45 cm .",
    "the signals from the preamplifiers are amplified by both spectroscopy amplifiers ( samp , model 472 ortec ) and timing filter amplifiers ( tfa , model 454 , ortec ) .",
    "the signals from the samp are led to a camac peak sensitive analog - digital - converter system ( adc , model ad811 , ortec ) while the signal from the tfa s are sent to a system of constant fraction discriminators ( cfd , model 935 , ortec ) where the thresholds are set above the noise level of the detectors .",
    "the logic output of the cfd is fed into a logic fan - in / fan - out ( fan - i / o , model 429a , ortec ) delivering a gate signal for the camac adcs with a gate width of 400 nsec .",
    "the logic output provides a start signal for a time spectrum via a camac time - digital - converter system ( tdc , model 2228a , lecroy ) .",
    "the stop signal of the tdc s is provided by the cfd with a 100 nsec delay .",
    "the signals from the adc and tdc systems are contlolled by a camac crate controller ( model cc7700 , toyo ) .",
    "the data from the crate controller is transferred to linux station ( model l400c , dell ) , via a camac bus , and stored on hard disk . a schematic diagram of the present data acquisition system is shown in fig .",

    "the typical counting rate of the measurement of the + reaction , which includes the background events caused by + d reaction , cosmic ray , and electrical noise is usually about 3 counts / sec .",

    "for the extended geometry in the present gas target experiment , the reaction energy distribution due to the energy loss of the ion beam along the beam path should be estimated precisely as possible . in low energy experiments",
    "this might raise the ambiguity for the electron screening potential ; we had to take care of experimental conditions such as target pressure or its difference along the beam axis . in this series experiments for energies",

    "although the greatest part of the energy loss occurs by collisions with electrons , low - energy ions lose their energy by collisions not only with electrons but with nuclei .",
    "since it is impossible to deduce stopping powers data near the zero energy , using present - day technology , we have to use updated compilations with an accuracy of ranges between 2 % and 10 % @xcite . therefore to calculate the energy loss in the target , we used the stopping power values estimated by the srim computer code @xcite , which gives results which are consistent with the experimental energy losses to within a 10 % difference at most .",

    "we employ the full target length of @xmath57 = 30 cm as the distance between the entrance of the target just after the collimator and the entrance of the beam calorimeter .",
    "since the rapid reduction of the cross section is about 11.2 % at e@xmath58()=90 kev over the target thickness when we assumed a constant @xmath59 factor , the effective energy loss is evaluated to be ( 500@xmath1450 ) ev .",

    "[ fig : beam - curr ] .",
    "there are several factors which affect the target density @xmath64 such as the gas temperature and a pressure gradient in the target chamber .",
    "we measured the target gas temperature with a termister ( 103at-2 ) inside the chamber which was likely to be different from that of the laboratory room since the target gas was heated by the beam and cooled by the circulated gas for the purification system .",
    "as the target pressure could not be measured directly at the beam - target interaction region during the experiment , the pressure was measured at the top of the target chamber as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : target - chamber ] . the pressure distribution caused by the geometry of detector holder , collimators and gas circulation was measured by extending the stainless tube directly from the capacitance manometer set downstream of the target chamber .",
    "the capacitance manometer , which is usually installed at the top of the target chamber , was removed to the end of the chamber only at this measurement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : target - chamber ] .",
    "simultaneously , we used another gauge just before the inlet to the chamber for a normalization .",
    "the difference between the target gas pressure at the top of the chamber and that measured at the interaction region was rather small , which might be a shorter mean - free path at gas pressure of the order of 0.1 torr .",
    "the absolute pressure at the target should be corrected by 5 % less than that measured at the top of the chamber .",
    "owing to these corrections , the target density can be determined to an accuracy of 1.3 % , considering the accuracy of 0.16 % from the target gas pressure , 1 % from the correction due to the gas temperature , and 0.8 % from the correction due to the measurement position .",
    "the measured and corrected target gas pressure at the every interval of 1.5 seconds is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : target - press ] .",
    "in order to find an optimum detector setup for a high efficiency and background free measurement , we exploit the monte carlo simulation program based on geant3 . it was used to calculate the interaction between the ejectiles and the detectors .",
    "also , the genbod code was used to generate the ejectiles .",
    "thus the program takes into account the following aspects : 1 ) the detector geometry , 2 ) the energy loss and energy straggling of the ejectiles in both the target gas and i the thin foil in front of the detector , 3 ) kinematic effects on the energy of the ejectiles in the target , 4 ) yield dependence of the ejectiles over the passage of the target , and 5 ) the non - uniform depletion thickness for the e counter .      to verify the validity of the simulation program , that is to estimate the systematic error , the experimental results of the d ( , p ) reaction ( q=18.4 mev )",
    "are compared with those of simulations .",
    "the comparison to this reaction has several advantages : 1 ) the generated protons from the + d reaction have a definite energy of 14.7 mev .",
    "2 ) the energy of the protons from this reaction is almost the same as that from the + reaction .",
    "3 ) the cross section of the + d reaction is six orders of magnitude larger than that of + reaction .",
    "the d(,p ) reaction was performed by using 90 kev ( e@xmath3=45 kev ) beam at the ocean facility .",
    "the target pressure of the deuterium gas was maintained around 1.0@xmath1510@xmath65 torr .",
    "[ fig : hed - dee - exp ] shows observed and simulated energy spectra obtained with the de - e are compared .",
    "the broad energy spectra for e = 5@xmath3914 mev at @xmath66e = 1 mev arise from an insufficient depletion depth for protons incident on the surface at angle near 90 degree .",
    "we applied a bias voltage of 180 v to the e - counter , which corresponds to the depletion depth of 900 @xmath7 m , to avoid a discharge in the gas target thicker depth needs more voltage .",
    "the other two structures arise from kinematics effects in combination with protons which are incident at angular ranges of 135@xmath21@xmath39180@xmath21 and 0@xmath21@xmath3945@xmath21 .",
    "these three remarkable features are well simulated in the energy spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hed - dee - exp ] ( b ) .",
    "it is crucial for the present measurement of the ( , 2p ) reaction to identify the background origin and to discriminate the true events from the fake events .",
    "as already stated , deuterium contamination in the target are the most serious .",
    "the number of deuterons in the gas target was determined from the data during the measurement of the ( , 2p ) reaction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rough - cut ] . for this estimate ,",
    "the value of the cross section for the d(,p ) reaction was taken from ref .",
    "we conclude that the deuterium contamination is 0.2 ppm in the target gas , and that such a level could make background events at least 0.1 % of the observed events of the ( , 2p ) reaction at the energy of e@xmath3=45 kev .",
    "another source of background events arises from electrical noise and cosmic rays .",
    "these are observed during the measurement without beam for 38 days of operation of ocean as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] . the contribution from this background to the window of the (",
    ", 2p)@xmath2 reaction is 3.6 counts / day . of these",
    ", the cosmic muon events are located around de = 70 kev and e = 450 kev because of the minimum ionization loss of 2 mev cm@xmath20/g .",
    "we attempted to reject these events by applying the veto - counter upper and lower places for the target chamber .",
    "finally the expected rate of the present reaction at lower energy is around a few events per day or less , and a typical single background rate of silicon detectors is one event per hour or more . in order to remove such accidental events , two proton coincidence",
    "should inevitably be required for the identification of the present reaction near the gamow peak ( next series of ocean experiment ) .",
    "we developed a reasonable method to determine the acceptable area for the real events of the ( , 2p ) reaction in the de - e scatter plot without a redundant and ambiguous procedure .",
    "four types of data such as observed events of the reaction , simulated events for the ( , 2p ) reaction and for the d(,p ) reaction , and observed background events are summarized for the analysis of each experimental run .",

    "[ fig : cut - point](a ) , without subtraction of any background events as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : hehe - area ] .    experimental results are as follows ; 3344 counts are observed in the acceptable region , while the contribution from the + d events to the region is 20.9 counts , and that from the other background component is 2.46 counts . after subtracting the number of these background events from the number of observed events in the acceptable region , the number of true events for the + reaction is 3337.4 , with a statistical error of 1.8 % . according to this procedure",
    ", the detection efficiency @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 to 16000 , @xmath71 is the number of counts for the simulated distribution , and @xmath72 is the parameter of the boundary cut point for the accepted events .",
    "the accepted event have been derived as @xmath73 where , @xmath74 refers to accepted events for the ( , 2p ) reaction , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the number of counts for the observed events , for the d(,p ) and for other background events , respectively .",
    "finally the ratio of @xmath78 corresponding to the cross section of the ( , 2p ) reaction can be obtained .",
    "the ratio slightly depends on the boundary parameter @xmath72 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaitest - accu ] .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the simulated energy distribution in a scatter plot should be derived from the fluctuation of this ratio .",
    "when we include the geometrical uncertainty of the counter telescope , i.e. , 0.5 % uncertainty of the detection efficiency simulated with monte carlo program , the systematical error of the detection efficiency is evaluated to be 3 % .",
    "the experimental results for the cross section and s - factors obtained for the first series of ocean experiments as from the year 2000 , together with the experimental conditions such as the live time , beam current , the target gas pressure , and the target temperature are shown in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "the observed events for the ( , 2p ) reaction and the background events from various sources are also shown in the same table [ tab : result ] .    the cross section for the ( , 2p ) reaction has been derived from the following equation , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the number of counts for ( , 2p ) reaction , @xmath46 is the target density , @xmath47 is the beam intensity , @xmath52 is the effective reaction energy , @xmath81 is the absolute detection efficiency , and @xmath82 is the stopping power .",

    "our present data between e@xmath3= 45 kev to 31 kev of s(e ) are in good agreement with the results of existing data of krauss et al @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of both statistical and the systematical data of the present measurement is better than that in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the last two decades , studies of the ( , 2p )",
    "reaction have been carried out over a wide range of energies ( bacher and tombrello @xcite , dwarakanath and winkler @xcite , krauss et al @xcite , and luna @xcite ) .",
    "of the previous studies , experiments between 17.9 to 342.5 kev center of mass energy by krauss et al cover a wider energy range than others since they used two accelerators of 350 kv accelerator in munster university and 100 kv facility at bochum university .",
    "recently the luna group in the lngs has presented data down to 16.50 kev center of mass energy , although the data was obtained with two separate experimental set - ups , namely at the 450 kv accelerator at bochum and also 50 kv at lngs .",
    "there remains unaccesible region of energy between 45.82 kev and 24.80 kev .",
    "the data in this energy region has been supplied by krauss et al .    in these previous experiments",
    "there were many efforts to obtain the true scarce events from the contaminated background events , such as deuterium contamination both in the incident beam and in the target gas , cosmic rays ( mainly muon ) or heavy particles , and electric noise .",
    "there have been several solutions for these difficulties ; krauss et al .",
    ", pointed out in 1987 the purity of the ion beam and of the target were of special interest and they estimated that at 350 kev the mass-3 beam contamination hd@xmath5 was of the order of 10@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "also they applied proton - proton coincidences to discriminate the real events from intruded events for the d(,p ) reaction .",
    "they surrounded the target chamber with ne102a plastic scintillator in order to identify for cosmic events . in this way",
    "the unidentified cosmic background coincidence event rate was estimated to be less than 1 event/200h in the measurements at e@xmath3 @xmath89 50 kev .",
    "another source of background events due to occasional discharges of the accelerator high voltage could be avoided by amplifier filter or noise filter . in spite of these efforts",
    ", they still consider the contribution of the events caused by the high energy protons from the ( d , p ) reaction ( e.g. 2.5 % contribution at e@xmath3=25 kev ) .",
    "they also evaluated that the background contribution to the + region is 0.40 % of the observed counts of the d- events .",
    "the measurements at the dtl showed that cosmic rays produced events within the de - e region of the ( , 2p ) reaction amounts to 3.5@xmath1510@xmath65 events / s , while in the latter place at lngs this rate was observed to be reduced by at least a factor 200 , that is , 1.8@xmath1510@xmath41 .",
    "it will be negligibly small for the low energy measurement less than 30 kev center of mass energy .",
    "we now argue that the ocean facility could overcome these difficulties by applying the following , while there still exist the possibilities of background due to the target gas :    \\1 ) only ocean exploits doubly charged he-3 ions produced with an ecr ion source and it could avoid the background events due to d ( beam ) + .",
    "krauss et al performed a p - p coincidence experiment to discriminate the true event , but it could not be applied for the center of mass energy less than 25 kev .",
    "\\2 ) our facility ocean has been located in an experimental area of the cyclotron and shielded with 5 m of thick concrete .",
    "we have observed the background events arising from cosmic rays in 38 days and also observed the effect from the induced events due to the high energy particles by using veto - counters composed of plastic scintillators located up and down the target chamber . by this condition of the ocean sight",
    "we still have a sufficient signal to noise ratio of 10 times larger than unknown fake events as listed in table [ tab : result ] .",
    "generally , there are still many discussions for the screening potential which enhance the cross section remarkably for low energy fusion reactions .",
    "a recent result of the ( , 2p ) reaction data assumed for electron screening with u@xmath90 = 330 ev and adopted a polynomial function for @xmath59 factor , namely @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 value is close to the recommended value of ad98 ( 5.4 + 0.4 mev b ) . in a review article concerning synthesis of the elements in stars @xcite",
    ", it cited luna data as @xmath93 mev b. it still includes a @xmath94 value which suggests that the effective value of @xmath94 may be larger than the adiabatic limit .",
    "furthermore , it is mentioned that improved data should be obtained at energies from e = 25 kev to 60 kev to confirm or reject the possibility of a relatively larger systematic error in the @xmath59 data around these energies .",
    "the present experiment with ocean has proved to reinforce the compilation data for nuclear astrophysics in solar fusion rates .",
    "high current and low background system could measure the cross section in the center of mass energy range from 50 to 30 kev . as a second series of experiments , we have started to measure at energies less than 30 kev , and these results",
    "will be reported in the near future .",
    "better results with respect to reduced stematic and statistical errors compared to existing data are expected .",
    "when we apply a beam intensity of 1 ma for the @xmath8 beam at e@xmath3 = 20 to 30 kev and a target gas pressure of 0.1 torr , we can expect 70 @xmath39 2 events per day for real events , while the fake event will be 6 @xmath39 1.8 events per day .",
