    "quantum physics differs in many aspects from our conventional intuition .",
    "one of such intriguing difference is the celebrated notion of nonlocality , which arises from the debate of the early 20th century among scientists .",
    "one line of the debate originated with einstein , podolsky , and rosen , who proposed the thought experiment known as epr paradox and the so - called  spooky - action - at - a - distance \" @xcite .",
    "their predictions of quantum mechanics are , in sharp contrast to the conventional view , that physical processes should obey the principle of locality .",
    "nonlocality of quantum physics has been studied from different points of view , such as by bell inequality and entanglement .",
    "the bell - type inequalities @xcite are derived by the local hidden variable theory , and may be violated by the quantum measurement outcomes realizable experimentally @xcite .",
    "the violation of bell inequalities implies the existence of entanglement in a system @xcite , however , this is not always true for the opposite case , as there exist mixed states that are entangled but do not violate any bell - type inequalities @xcite .",
    "other studies further consolidate that there is also nonlocality without entanglement @xcite , or nonlocality without quantum correlations other than entanglement @xcite .",
    "so nonlocality seems can be quantified reasonably by different measures .",
    "nowadays , we realized that nonlocality is not only a central concept of quantum mechanics , but may also be used to improve the efficiency of many quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it is also interrelated with other foundational theory of quantum mechanics such as uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "these delicate and intriguing features of nonlocality prompted a huge surge of people s interest from the quantum physics community , with notable progresses being achieved in the past few years @xcite .",
    "apart from the traditional line for quantum nonlocality related to entanglement or bell inequalities , it is also significant to investigate it from other perspectives",
    ". recently , luo and fu @xcite presented a new measure of nonlocality which they termed as measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) motivated by the definition of quantum discord @xcite .",
    "as the name itself indicates , the min characterizes nonlocality from a measurement perspective , and thus is different from other nonlocality measures .",
    "it is a manifestation of the global disturbance to the overall state of a system caused by the locally non - disturbing measurement on one subsystem , and can also be considered as one kind of nonclassical correlation measure different from entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "the min has been one of current research focuses for years @xcite",
    ". however , its quantification based on the hilbert - schmidt norm ( we call it conventional min for brevity ) , while intuitively appealing and conceptually significant , has certain discouraging properties . to see this explicitly , we recall its definition , which reads @xcite @xmath1 for a bipartite state @xmath2 in @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath4 denotes the hilbert - schmidt norm , and the maximum is taken over the full set of local projective measurements @xmath5 that keep the reduced state @xmath6 invariant , namely , @xmath7 .",
    "an analytical formula of the conventional min for any @xmath0 dimensional state @xmath2 can be obtained @xcite . here",
    ", we argue that the conventional min in eq . , despite being favored for its convenience of calculation , may has certain undesirable properties . more specifically , we will show that it can increase or decrease under trivial local reversible operations on the unmeasured subsystem @xmath8 of @xmath2 .",
    "consider , for instance , a channel @xmath9 acting as @xmath10 ( i.e. , it introduces a local ancilla to @xmath8 ) , then by making use of the multiplicativity of the schatten @xmath11-norm ( which reduces to the hilbert - schmidt norm when @xmath12 ) under tensor products , we obtain @xmath13 this equality means that @xmath14 as the purity of a state is no larger than one , @xmath15 . particularly , if @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the @xmath18-dimensional identity operator , we obtain @xmath19",
    ". then @xmath20 will approach zero when @xmath18 takes the limit of infinity .",
    "this behavior differs completely from our intuition that the nonlocal properties of a system should not be affected by trivially adding or removing an uncorrelated local ancillary state .",
    "we remark here that the above perplexity is reminiscent of the phenomena encountered for the geometric measure of quantum discord ( gqd ) @xcite . in that case ,",
    "several well - defined measures of gqd have been introduced to remedy this problem @xcite .",
    "motivated by the proposition for modifying gqd via trace norm @xcite , we propose to define the min for a bipartite state @xmath2 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 denotes still the projective measurements that satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "we call @xmath25 the trace min hereafter",
    ". the physical interpretation of this new nonlocality measure can still be presented as the maximal global effect , or more explicitly , the maximal trace distance that the postmeasurement state @xmath26 departs from its premeasurement state @xmath2 , caused by locally invariant measurements .",
    "the nonlocality measure defined above can circumvent the problem occurred for the conventional min as implied by eq . .",
    "explicitly , let us repeat the analysis by adding an uncorrelated ancilla when the new definition is used , then @xmath27 due to the normalization condition @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 does not increase under the action of @xmath9 , namely , it is unaffected by adding or removing a factorized local ancilla on the unmeasured party . here , we further show a more general and powerful result related to the trace min in eq . .",
    "_ theorem 1 .",
    "_ the trace min @xmath25 defined in eq . is nonincreasing under the action of any completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) channel @xmath29 on the unmeasured party @xmath8 , i.e. , we always have @xmath30.\\ ] ] _ proof .",
    "_ let @xmath29 be an arbitrary cptp channel acting on party @xmath8 of @xmath2 , and @xmath31 be the optimal projection - valued measurement on party @xmath32 that maximizes the trace norm on the right - hand side of eq . for @xmath33 $ ] , namely , @xmath34",
    "= ||\\mathcal { e}_b(\\rho_{ab } )                                   -\\tilde{\\pi}^a[\\mathcal{e}_b(\\rho_{ab})]||_1,\\ ] ] then , by noting that any local channel on party @xmath8 and the measurement made on party @xmath32 commute , we obtain @xmath35=\\mathcal{e}_b [ \\tilde{\\pi}^a ( \\rho_{ab})]$ ] , and therefore , by denoting @xmath36 ( note that @xmath37 in general ) the optimal measurement for obtaining @xmath25 , we have @xmath38||_1 \\nonumber\\\\                 & = & n_1[\\mathcal { e}_b(\\rho_{ab})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first inequality comes from the fact that @xmath39 is not necessarily the optimal state to @xmath2 , and the second inequality is due to the contractivity of the trace norm under cptp map ( theorem 9.2 of ref .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the above theorem means that no physical process on @xmath8 can increase the maximum trace distance between a state @xmath2 and its postmeasurement state @xmath26 obtained after the locally invariant measurements on party @xmath32 , and therefore it circumvents successfully the problem occurred for the conventional min .",
    "we now list some other basic properties of the trace min .",
    "( i ) @xmath40 for all the product states @xmath41 , and the classical - quantum states @xmath42 with nondegenerate @xmath43 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath25 is invariant under locally unitary operation @xmath44 on @xmath2 , namely , @xmath45 , which is obvious as the trace norm is preserved under unitary transformations @xcite .",
    "the proposed trace min can be used to detect the effect of a locally invariant measurement on the overall state of a system , and the zero trace min implies that the state of the system can not be disturbed by any locally invariant measurement , namely , the measurement of one subsystem can not determine the corresponding result of a measurement of the other , and therefore this system obeys the principle of locality . moreover , from the basic properties listed above , one can note that while any entangled or discordant state possess nonvanishing trace min , there also exist states with nonvanishing trace min but do not produce correlations of entanglement or discord .",
    "therefore , the trace min is an important complementary to , but different from , entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "the maximization in eq . over the full set of locally invariant measurements on party @xmath32 can be obtained for certain family of states , and in turn the trace min can be evaluated analytically .",
    "we present them via the following theorems .",
    "_ theorem 2 . _ for any @xmath0 dimensional pure state @xmath46 with the schmidt decomposition @xmath47 _ proof .",
    "_ we denote @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for simplicity , then if @xmath50 is nondegenerate , the optimal measurement @xmath51 , and we have @xmath52 therefore @xmath53 the singular values of which can be obtained as @xmath54 , and thus @xmath55 if @xmath50 is degenerate ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) , assuming the optimal locally invariant measurement to be @xmath57 , with @xmath58 then as one can always find a unitary operator @xmath59 such that @xmath60 is locally unitary invariant , we obtain @xmath61 after a similar analysis as that performed for the nondegenerate case , and this completes our proof .    as the entanglement of formation ( eof ) for @xmath46",
    "was given by @xmath62 @xcite , the above theorem implies that @xmath63 constitutes an entanglement monotone .",
    "but this is not the case for general states .",
    "moreover , one can derive @xmath64 , which means that for this special case , both @xmath63 and @xmath65 give qualitatively the same characterizations of nonlocality .    for general @xmath66 dimensional pure state in the schmidt expression @xmath67 , and @xmath68",
    ", we have @xmath69 when @xmath70 is nondegenerate , but a closed form of its singular values can not be derived for @xmath71 , and in turn it is difficult to obtain an analytical formula of @xmath72 . for the degenerate @xmath73 , an analysis similar as that for @xmath74 yields @xmath75 .",
    "now , we calculate the trace min for a general two - qubit state @xmath76 , which has been proved to be locally unitary equivalent to @xmath2 of the following form @xcite @xmath77 where the vectors @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are the three pauli operators .",
    "the local unitary invariance of the trace min enables @xmath84 , and therefore it suffices to consider the representative family of states @xmath2 in eq . ,",
    "for which @xmath25 can be evaluated analytically .",
    "_ theorem 3 .",
    "_ for any two - qubit state of the form of eq .",

    "therefore @xmath100 if @xmath93 is degenerate , i.e. , @xmath101 , then by adopting the similar lines as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can obtain @xmath102 with @xmath103 being a unit vector in @xmath104 . by further ordering the singular values of the correlation tensor",
    "@xmath105 as @xmath106 , we have @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are given by @xmath110,\\nonumber\\\\   & & h = a(\\theta)\\sin^4\\phi+b(\\theta)\\sin^2\\phi+c(\\theta),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + with the @xmath111-dependent functions @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 ( note that there is a misprint in @xcite , @xmath115 in the expression for @xmath114 should be @xmath116 ) being given by @xmath117,\\nonumber\\\\   & & c(\\theta)=[c_+^2-c_0 ^ 2-\\sin^2\\theta(c_+^2-c_-^2)]^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by combining eqs . and , one can note that both @xmath108 and @xmath109 reach their maxima when @xmath118 , for which @xmath119 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we have @xmath120 , and thus @xmath121 this completes our proof .",
    "we would like to point out here that for the two - qubit @xmath2 with nondegenerate @xmath93 , the calculation of the trace min can also be performed in a similar manner as that for the degenerate case .",
    "but now the expression for @xmath122 in eq . is more complicated ( see eq . [ 31 ] in ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ) , and therefore we adopted the procedure listed above as the optimal @xmath123 can be written explicitly for this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) , we presented an exemplified plot of the level surfaces of @xmath124 for the bell - diagonal states @xmath125 [ i.e. , @xmath101 and @xmath126 in eq . ] .",
    "as physical @xmath127 belongs to a tetrahedron @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and @xmath129 , the surfaces of constant trace min correspond to the cross sections of the six surfaces of a cube @xmath130 of side length @xmath131 with @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath132 , the surfaces of @xmath130 are also the surfaces of constant trace min , while for @xmath133 , partial of them are cut by the four surfaces of @xmath128 .    by denoting @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 the maximum , intermediate , and minimum values of @xmath137 , respectively , one can derive a relation between @xmath131 and @xmath138 for the bell - diagonal states @xmath125 as @xmath139 this implies that the two different min measures may impose different orderings of nonlocality , as when @xmath140 keeps unchanged , @xmath131 also keeps unchanged , while @xmath141 increases ( decreases ) with the increasing ( decreasing ) value of @xmath135 in the region of @xmath142 .",
    "thus there is no one - to - one correspondence between the well - defined trace min and the conventional min in general , and we hope this simple example may provide some intuition about the subtle issue concerning the appropriateness of using the hilbert - schmidt norm as a distance for quantifying nonlocality , just as the appropriateness of using it for defining gqd @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also worthwhile to point out that when @xmath143 being subject to the @xmath144 channel ( with @xmath145 representing respectively , the bit flip , bit - phase flip , and phase flip channels ) , we have @xmath146 , and @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , where @xmath149 for the one - sided channel @xmath150 or @xmath151 , and @xmath152 for the two - sided channel @xmath153 , with @xmath154 being the decay rate . as a consequence ,",
    "if @xmath155 at the initial time , we obtain @xmath156=|c_i(0)|$ ] by eq . , which is not destroyed by the @xmath144 noise during the whole time region",
    "this is in sharp contrast to other nonclassical correlation measures which remain constant only for a finite time interval @xcite .",
    "this unique and novel characteristic of the trace min is not only conceptually significant , but is also appealing for potential quantum algorithms relying on it .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) plots the valid regions of @xmath127 for which @xmath131 can evade the detrimental effects of the phase flip channel .",
    "they belong to two hexahedra with vertices @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath157 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "the results for the bit ( bit - phase ) flip channel is similar , with @xmath162 replacing @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "so far we have obtained analytical formulas of the trace min for any @xmath0 dimensional pure state and a general two - qubit state , and discussed several interesting implications of them .",
    "we now turn to consider two high - dimensional states with symmetry .",
    "the analytical expressions of some quantum correlation measures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) for them have already been obtained @xcite .",
    "consider first the celebrated werner state on @xmath165 @xcite , which can be written as @xmath166,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which admits the local unitary invariance , i.e. , @xmath167 for any local unitary operation @xmath168 , and therefore one can choose the optimal measurement basis to be @xmath169 , which yields @xmath170 as @xmath171 constitutes a permutation matrix ( a binary matrix with exactly one entry 1 in each row and each column and zeros elsewhere ) , the singular values of @xmath172 can be evaluated directly as @xmath173 with multiplicity @xmath174 .",
    "then , by the definition we obtain @xmath175 therefore @xmath176 vanishes only when @xmath177 , and it implies that for the present case , the trace min disappears only when @xmath178 reduces to the maximally mixed one .",
    "meanwhile , the conventional min for @xmath179 had also been derived analytically @xcite , from which we obtain @xmath180 this means that both @xmath181 and @xmath182 give qualitatively the same descriptions of nonlocality for @xmath178 with finite @xmath183 .",
    "but it should be note that their asymptotic behaviors are different because @xmath184 , and @xmath185 .",
    "the second high - dimensional state we want to consider is the @xmath186 dimensional isotropic state expressed as follows @xmath187,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath188 , and @xmath189 denotes the computational basis on @xmath190 .",
    "for this state , let @xmath191 be the measurement basis that maximizes the trace norm in eq .",
    ", then due to the symmetry of @xmath192 , one can always find local unitary operation @xmath168 such that @xmath193 , and the local unitary invariance of @xmath181 enables @xmath194 $ ] .",
    "therefore , by denoting @xmath195 , we obtain @xmath196 the singular values of which can be evaluated analytically as @xmath197 with multiplicity @xmath198 and @xmath199 with multiplicity @xmath200 , and this yields @xmath201 here , the trace min @xmath202 only when @xmath203 , namely , when @xmath204 comes to be maximally mixed . moreover , the analytical expression for the conventional min can be obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite , by combining of which we obtain @xmath205 their asymptotic values are given by @xmath206 , and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "it implies that the two min measures still give qualitatively the same characterizations of nonlocality for the isotropic state .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that for the special case @xmath208 , i.e. , when @xmath204 reduces to the maximally entangled state , we have @xmath209 , which is just twice that of the conventional min .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a well - defined measure of nonlocality by making using of the trace norm .",
    "it can remedy the undesirable property of the conventional min which can be changed arbitrarily and reversibly by trivial local action on the subsystem .",
    "we proved explicitly that the proposed trace min is nonincreasing under the action of general cptp quantum channels on the unmeasured subsystem .",
    "this property has by itself a conceptual significance , as it has already been proved that the schatten 1-norm ( trace norm ) is the only @xmath11-norm that can be used to give a well - defined quantum correlation measure @xcite . here",
    ", the fascinating properties of the trace min show again the ubiquitousness and intrinsic significance of the schatten 1-norm for defining min .",
    "we hope this may shed some new light on the issue concerning the characterization and quantification of nonlocality from a measurement perspective .",
    "we have also presented analytical formulas of the trace min for any @xmath0 dimensional pure state , two - qubit state , as well as the werner states and the isotropic states on @xmath165 which possess high symmetry .",
    "we revealed through these results that the trace min captures the nonlocal property of a system more intrinsically than that of the conventional min .",
    "moreover , we revealed a unique and appealing characteristic of this new proposed nonlocality measure , namely , it can evade the detrimental effects of certain noisy channels during the whole time region for elaborately designed initial states .",
    "this may have potential applications in qip for its coherence protecting property .",
    "we remark that the entropic measure of min based on the von neumann entropy @xcite , or its equivalent form based on the relative entropy @xcite , is also monotonically decreasing due to the monotonicity of the quantum mutual information under channels on @xmath8 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed proof ) .",
    "moreover , it has already been pointed out that one can remedy the min via the square root of the considered density matrix @xcite . here",
    ", we mention that it is also natural to define the min as @xmath210}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] via the bures distance @xcite , with @xmath23 being the locally invariant measurement and @xmath211 ^ 2 $ ] denotes the uhlmann fidelity . by using the monotonicity of the bures distance @xcite and after a similar analysis as that for proving theorem 1",
    ", one can show directly that @xmath212 is also nonincreasing under general cptp channels .",
    "but its evaluation may be intractable and further investigation is needed . thus the measure presented in this paper",
    "may be widely used for its concise and simple form .    the significance for this computable measure of the trace min in qip",
    "can be studied parallel as that of quantum entanglement and quantum discord , see reviews @xcite .",
    "additionally , it may be applied as a new technique to various models to study physical phenomena such as quantum phase transitions , topologies of those systems , similar as the applications of entanglement , see for example @xcite . moreover , as nonlocality is quantitatively related with heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite , which provides the basis for the security of quantum cryptography @xcite , the obvious physical significance of the trace min and its convenience of calculation is also hoped to play a role in these related issues .",
