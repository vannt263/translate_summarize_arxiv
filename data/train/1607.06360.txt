    "the nontrivial @xmath1 dependence is related to the breaking of the axial @xmath16 symmetry and related issues of the hadronic phenomenology  @xcite , such as the @xmath17 mass .",
    "moreover , it is related to the axion physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) , put forward to provide a solution of the strong cp problem @xcite , i.e. to explain the fact that the experimental value of @xmath1 is compatible with zero , with a very small bound @xmath18 from neutron electric dipole measurements @xcite .",
    "axions are also natural dark matter candidates @xcite and , given the absence of susy signals from accelerator experiments , this is becoming one of the most theoretically appealing possibility .",
    "the ground - state energy density of 4d @xmath3 gauge theories is an even function of @xmath1 .",
    "it is expected to be analytic at @xmath5 , thus it can be expanded in the form @xmath19 where @xmath7 is the topological susceptibility , and the dimensionless coefficients @xmath8 parametrize the non - quadratic part of the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "they are related to the cumulants of the topological charge distribution at @xmath5 ; in particular @xmath8 quantify the deviations from a simple gaussian distribution .",
    "standard large-@xmath0 arguments predict the large-@xmath0 behavior  @xcite @xmath20 since @xmath7 and @xmath8 can not be computed analytically , these large-@xmath0 scaling relations can be only tested numerically .",
    "earlier studies have mainly focused on the investigation of the large-@xmath0 scaling of the topological susceptibility , reporting a good agreement with the corresponding large-@xmath0 expectations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the numerical determination of the higher - order coefficients of the @xmath1 expansion turns out to be a difficult numerical challenge .",

    "@xcite , presenting a first attempt to investigate the large-@xmath0 scaling of @xmath22 ; the numerical precision that could be reached was however quite limited , with a signal for @xmath23 at two standard deviation from zero and only an upper bound for @xmath24 .    in order to further support the evidence of the large-@xmath0 scaling scenario beyond the quadratic term of the expansion of the ground - state energy dentity ( [ thdep ] )",
    ", we investigate the scaling of the higher - order terms , in particular those associated with @xmath22 and @xmath25 . from the computational point of view , the most convenient method to perform such an investigation exploits monte carlo simulations of @xmath3 gauge theories in the presence of an imaginary @xmath1 angle , which are not plagued by the sign problem .",
    "their analysis allows us to obtain accurate estimates of the coefficients of the expansion around @xmath5 .",
    "analogous methods based on computations at imaginary values of @xmath1 have been already employed in some numerical studies of the @xmath21 gauge theory  @xcite and @xmath4 models @xcite .",
    "2d @xmath4 models share with 4d @xmath3 gauge theories many physically interesting properties , like asymptotic freedom , dynamical mass generation , confinement , instantons and @xmath1 dependence ; moreover their large-@xmath0 expansion can be studied by analytical methods  @xcite .",

    "an expansion of the form eq .   applies also to the @xmath1 dependence of 2d @xmath4 models . similarly to 4d @xmath3 gauge theories , large-@xmath0 scaling arguments predict the large-@xmath0 behavior @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these large-@xmath0 scaling behaviors are confirmed by explicit analytical computations , see  @xcite . in this paper , following the approach introduced in @xcite , we present a systematic and easily automated way of computing the leading large-@xmath0 terms of @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sun ] we present the results obtained for the case of the 4d @xmath3 gauge theories : first we discuss the numerical setup used and the reasons for some specific algorithmic choices adopted , then we present the physical results obtained . in section  [ sec : cpn ] the case of the 2d @xmath4 models is discussed and a determination of the leading order large-@xmath0 expansion for the coefficients @xmath8 is presented . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we draw our conclusions . in appendices some technical details",
    "are examined regarding a comparison between smoothing algorithms in @xmath24 ( app .  [ sec : cgf ] ) and an attempt to reduce the autocorrelation time using a parallel tempering algorithm ( app .",

    "the traditional procedure that has been used in past to compute the coefficients entering eq .   consists in relating them to the fluctuations of the topological charge @xmath28 at @xmath5 .",
    "the first few coefficients of the expansion can indeed be written as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath29_{\\theta=0}}{360 \\langle q^2\\rangle_{\\theta=0 } } , \\label{b4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] etc . , where @xmath30 is the 4d volume and all the averages are computed using the action with @xmath5 . while this method is obviously correct from the theoretical point of view , it is numerically inefficient for the determination of the @xmath8 coefficients .",
    "indeed fluctuation observables are not self - averaging @xcite and , in order to keep a constant signal to noise ratio , one has to dramatically increase the statistics of the simulations when increasing the volume ( see e.g. @xcite for a numerical example ) . as a consequence",
    "it is extremely difficult to keep finite size effects under control and to extract the infinite - volume limit .    to avoid this problem",
    ", one can introduce a source term in the action , which allows us to better investigate the response of the system .",
    "this can be achieved by performing numerical simulations at imaginary values of the @xmath1 angle , @xmath31 , in order to maintain the positivity of the path integral measure and avoid a sign problem , and study for example the behaviour of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "it is indeed easy to verify that @xcite @xmath34 also higher cumulants of the topological charge distribution ( for which relations analogous to eq .",
    "exist ) can be used for this purpose , however the numerical precision quickly degrades for higher cumulants .",
    "nevertheless , since the computation of these higher cumulants does not require any additional cpu time , the optimal strategy seems to be to perform a common fit to a few of the lowest cumulants of the topological charge @xcite ( of course by taking into account the correlation between them ) .",
    "after this general introduction to motivate the computational strategy adopted , we describe the details of the discretization setup . for the @xmath21 case we use results already reported in the literature , while new simulations are performed for the @xmath23 and @xmath24 cases .",

    "we adopt the discretization @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the plaquette , @xmath40 coincides with the usual levi - civita tensor for positive entries and it is extended to negative ones by @xmath41 and complete antisymmetry . the discretization eq",
    ".   of the topological charge density makes the total action in eq .",
    "linear in each gauge link , thus enabling the adoption of standard efficient update algorithms , like heat - bath and overrelaxation , a fact of paramount importance , since we have to deal with the strong critical slowing down of the topological modes  @xcite .",
    "a practical complication is due to the fact that the discretization of the topological charge density induces a finite renormalization of @xmath14  @xcite and thus of @xmath1 . denoting this renormalization constant by @xmath42",
    ", we thus have @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the numerical value that is used in the actual simulation .",
    "two different strategies can be used to cope with this complication : in one case @xmath42 is computed separately and eq .",
    "can then be directly used ( see @xcite for more details ) . another possibility",
    "consists in rewriting eq .  , and the analogous equations for the higher cumulants , directly in term of @xmath44 , in such a way that by performing a common fit to the cumulants it is possible to evaluate both @xmath42 and the parameters appearing in eq .",
    "( see @xcite for more details ) . in our numerical work",
    "we adopt the second strategy , that turn out to be slightly more efficient from the numerical point of view .",
    "all results that we present are obtained by analyzing the @xmath33 dependence of the first four cumulants of the topological charge distribution .    in order to avoid the appearance of further renormalization factors ,",
    "the topological charge is measured on smoothed configurations .",
    "the smoothing procedure adopted uses the standard cooling technique  @xcite , which is the computationally cheapest procedure ( especially for large values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "cooling is implemented _  la _ cabbibbo - marinari , using the @xmath45 diagonal @xmath46 subgroups of @xmath3 , and we follow @xcite in defining the measured topological charge @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the integer closest to @xmath50 and the coefficient @xmath51 is the value that minimize @xmath52\\right)^2\\right\\rangle \\ .\\ ] ] this procedure is introduced in order to avoid the necessity for prolongated cooling , and in fact we observe no significant differences in the results obtained by using a number of cooling steps between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , while more than @xmath55 cooling steps would be needed to reach a plateaux using just @xmath56 instead of the @xmath47 defined by eq .  .",
    "at finite lattice spacing , the two definitions ( rounded vs. non - rounded ) can lead to different results corresponding to different lattice artefacts , however it has been shown that the same continuum limit is reached in the two cases  @xcite . the results that we present in the following are obtained using @xmath57 cooling steps and the definition of @xmath47 in eq .  .",

    "we verify that this range of values is large enough to give a clear signal , but not so large to introduce systematic errors .",
    "the results of all tests performed using a smaller interval of @xmath44 values give perfectly compatible results .    for the update we use a combination of standard heat - bath @xcite and overrelaxation @xcite algorithms , implemented _  la _ cabibbo - marinari @xcite using all the @xmath45 diagonal @xmath46 subgroups of @xmath3 .",
    "the topological charge is evaluated every 10 update steps , one update step being composed of a heath - bath and five overrelaxation updates for all the links of the lattice , updated in a mixed checkerboard and lexicographic order .",
    "the total statistic acquired for each coupling value is typically of @xmath63 measures .      in order to apply the analytic continuation method in an actual computation ,",
    "it is necessary to truncate the expansion in eq .",
    "( or , which is the same , in eq .  ) in order to fit the numerical data .",
    "we actually perform a global fit to the first four cumulants which , when rewritten in terms of @xmath44 , read @xmath64 an example of such global fit , with a truncation including up to @xmath65 terms in the ground state energy density ( i.e. setting @xmath66 ) , is reported in fig .",

    "for example this occurs in the high - temperature regime of 4d @xmath3 gauge theories : for high temperatures the dilute instanton - gas approximation is expected to provide reliable results and one gets ( see e.g. @xcite ) the result @xmath163 for any @xmath0 value .",
    "while the diga approximation is a priori expected to be valid only at asymptotically high temperatures , the switch from the large @xmath0 behavior to the instanton gas behavior occurs at the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation method that we used to compute the @xmath1 dependence can be also exploited in finite - temperature simulation , where it is typically even more efficient term increases the critical temperature @xcite . ] . as an example of its application in finite - temperature runs , fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] presents an updating of the results presented in @xcite regarding the change of @xmath1 dependence across the deconfinement transition .",
    "while the results for @xmath165 were precise enough also in the original publication , the region below deconfinement is much more difficult ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . by combining the result for @xmath21 obtained in @xcite and the present ones for @xmath24 , in the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig : b2 t ] we can now display the continuum extrapolated zero temperature value of @xmath22 for @xmath24 and much more precise results for the finite temperature values of @xmath22 .",
    "these results confirm the results of @xcite to an higher accuracy : in the low - temperature phase the large-@xmath0 scaling holds true ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 being almost temperature independent ) , an abrupt change of the @xmath1 dependence of the free energy happens at deconfinement and the @xmath8 values do not depend on @xmath0 in the high - temperature phase .",
    "finally , this paper also reports a study of the large-@xmath0 @xmath1 dependence of the 2d @xmath4 models , whose leading behavior can be computed analytically .",
    "the results confirm the predicted large-@xmath0 scaling behavior @xmath166 for the coefficients of the expansion of the ground - state energy around @xmath5 .     across the deconfinement transition for @xmath21 and @xmath24 ( @xmath167 is the reduced temperature defined by @xmath168 ) .",
    "the horizontal bands denote the zero temperature values .",
    "updated version of the figure originally presented in @xcite . ]",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with francesco bigazzi and haris panagopoulos .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed on the galileo machine at cineca ( under infn project npqcd ) , on the csn4 cluster of the scientific computing center at infn - pisa and on grid resources provided by infn .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that cooling and the gradient flow with wilson action give identical results for the topological charge when the number of cooling steps @xmath169 is related to the dimensionless flow time @xmath170 by the relation @xmath171 .",
    "this relation was explicitly verified by simulation in @xmath21 gauge theory and it was later extended to improved gauge actions @xcite . during the early stages of this work we numerically verified on a subsample of configurations that , as theoretically expected , the same relation holds true also in the @xmath24 case .",

    "parallel tempering @xcite , also know as replica exchange monte carlo , is the most widely used variant of the simulated tempering algorithm @xcite and was originally introduced to speed up simulations of spin glasses . in this appendix",
    "we report the results of some tests performed to investigate the effectiveness of parallel tempering to reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge in @xmath24 .",
    "parallel tempering is typically used in systems with complicated energy landscapes to reduce the autocorrelation times .",
    "the original idea is to perform standard simulations at various temperatures ( with higher temperatures decorrelating faster than the lower ones ) and once in a while try to exchange the configurations at different temperatures with a metropolis - like step , that guarantees the detailed balance and hence the stochastic exactness of the algorithms . in this way",
    "the quickly decorrelating runs `` feed '' the slow ones and autocorrelations are drastically reduced .    for the case of gauge theories the first natural choice would be to use parallel tempering between runs at different @xmath172 values , with the runs at large values of @xmath172 playing the role of the slowly decorrelating ones .",
    "although from a theoretical point of view this should work , one is faced with an efficiency problem : in order for the exchanges to be accepted with reasonable probability the @xmath172 values have to be close to each other , in fact closer and closer as the volume is increased , thus making the algorithm not convenient apart from extreme cases .",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for applications to the 2d @xmath4 models .",
    "this is the reason why alternative procedures have been proposed to work with different @xmath172 values , that are closer in spirit to the idea of multi - level simulations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an exchange was proposed every 4 measures , while in @xmath173 it was proposed every 40 measures . ]    since we are using simulations at nonvanishing values of the @xmath1 angle , an alternative possibility is to perform the switch step of the parallel tempering between runs at different @xmath44 values @xcite . in this case",
    "there are no `` fast '' and `` slow '' runs , but since the mean values of the topological charge are different for different @xmath44 values , the switch step characteristic of the parallel tempering is expected to effectively increase the tunneling rate of the topological charge .    as a testbed for the parallel tempering in @xmath44 we used @xmath24 with coupling @xmath174 and @xmath44 values from @xmath175 to @xmath176 with @xmath60 . using the standard algorithm described in sec .",
    "[ sec : numset ] the autocorrelation time of the square of the topological charge is around @xmath55 measures ( with 1 measure every 10 updates ) and we tried two different exchange frequencies in the parallel tempering : in the run denoted by @xmath177 an exchange was proposed every 4 measures , while in @xmath173 it was proposed every 40 measures ; in both the cases the proposed switch was accepted with a probability of about @xmath178 .",

    "this reduction of @xmath181 is however not sufficient to compensate for the cpu time required to perform the update of the 11 replicas used in the parallel tempering , since simulations at nonvanishing @xmath44 values are about 2.5 more time consuming than simulation at @xmath58 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the idea of the method of analytic continuation in @xmath1 for computing the @xmath8 coefficients is exactly to use several @xmath44 values anyway , so that one can still hope to have an efficiency gain .",

    "if this interpretation is correct , then the observed reduction of the autocorrelation times at fixed @xmath44 is just a consequence of the reshuffling of the configurations induced by the exchanges , which are very frequent due to the largest uv fluctuations of @xmath56 .",
    "the update of the global information contained in the time histories at different @xmath44 values , which is the one used in the global fit , suffers instead from the usual autocorrelation problems .",

    "@xcite ; this would require to abandon the heatbath and overrelaxation algorithms in favour of an hybrid monte carlo approach  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear a priori whether that would result in an improvement of the global decorrelation properties , i.e. in a final net gain , or rather in a deterioration of the autocorrelation time for the single trajectory at fixed @xmath44 , because of the rarer configuration reshuffling .",
