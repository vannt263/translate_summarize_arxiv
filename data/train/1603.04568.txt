    "with the recent discovery of the higgs boson , the last `` missing piece '' of the standard model ( sm ) was finally found .",
    "however , the long - standing mystery , that the higgs couplings ( mass matrices ) appear to be rather arbitrary , remains to be resolved .",
    "a commonly held view posits that the sm is but an effective theory originating from some other theory valid at high energies , and that more regularity can be found there . to bridge these two energy regimes ,",
    "one makes use of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "such rges for the mass matrices have been around for a long time ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "they are relatively simple when written in terms of the mass matrices themselves .",
    "however , these matrices contain a large number of unphysical degrees of freedom , which must be stripped away to reveal the values of the physical variables , viz .",
    ", the masses and the mixing matrices .",
    "the procedure is by no means easy , and it is hard to correlate the variables in the two energy regions .",
    "for this reason a lot of efforts have gone into recasting the rges into equations containing only physical variables @xcite . with these equations",
    "the physical variables at different energies can be directly related .",
    "thus , for instance , one may test possible scenarios for mass patterns at high energies , using the rge to see if they could evolve into the existing low - energy values .",
    "the challenge here comes from the complexity of the rges , which are lengthy , nonlinear , partial differential equations , so that the relations of variables at different energy scales are often obscure , and one can have only a partial view with the use of various approximation schemes .",
    "this difficulty , one would hope , can be mitigated to some extent by a judicious choice of the physical variables .",
    "indeed , in this paper we propose to cast the one - loop quark rges in terms of a set of rephasing - invariant variables introduced earlier @xcite .",
    "it is found that these rges can be written in a compact form .",
    "in addition , they exhibit manifest symmetries which , as a consequence of the permutation properties of the chosen variables , give these equations a very simple structure . as it turns out , this set of equations is still too complicated to be solved analytically .",
    "however , under reasonable assumptions ( hierarchy , degeneracy , etc . ) , approximate solutions are available .",
    "these will be presented in this paper . as more properties are found about these equations",
    ", one may hope that they will help in the search for a viable high - energy theory .",
    "it is well known that physical observables are independent of rephasing transformations on the mixing matrices of quantum - mechanical states .",
    "thus , instead of individual elements of the mixing matrix , only rephasing - invariant combinations thereof are physical .",
    "whereas there is nothing wrong with using these elements in intermediate steps of a calculation , at the end of the day , they must form rephasing - invariant combinations in physical quantities .",
    "this situation is similar to that in gauge theory , where one often resorts to a particular gauge choice for certain problems .",
    "the final results , however , must be gauge invariant . in this paper",
    ", we propose to use , from the outset , parameters that are rephasing invariant . as we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "iii , in terms of these , the quark rges become quite simple in structure , making it easier to analyze the properties of their solutions .",
