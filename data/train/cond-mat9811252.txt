    "proteins are known to fold into a unique native state that is biologically active @xcite . despite their complexity and frustrated character ,",
    "their folding rate is fast and the folding times vary from milliseconds to seconds . however , these times are long compared to the usual collapse time of a homopolymer ( a few microseconds ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the diversity of the aminoacids and the resulting frustration play a crucial role in the slowing down .",
    "the main picture that has emerged to describe this type of dynamics is that of a `` funnel - like '' phase space @xcite : the folding pathway of a protein in phase space is along a unique but rough funnel towards its ground state .",
    "however , so far , this picture is not based on microscopic models .",
    "numerical simulations that have been dealing with lattice models of short disordered polymers tend to support this funnel picture .",
    "a number of these simulations seem to show that `` good folders '' ( sequences that fold rapidly to their ground state , and are thus good candidates to represent real proteins ) indeed follow a `` funnel '' in the energy landscape , whereas `` bad folders '' possess a large number of energetic traps along the dynamical path that slow down the folding process @xcite .",
    "several studies have tried to relate the foldability of model proteins with their energy gap .",
    "it has been argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that model proteins which have a large energy gap between the native state and the first conformationally different ( compact ) state fold rapidly .",
    "on the other hand , other studies @xcite have shown that the parameter which governs the rapidity of folding is the distance of the folding temperature to the collapse temperature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the situation is not so simple , and that in particular , the folding rate depends very much on the dynamics used for the simulations .",
    "in particular , we show that for certain transition rates , a large gap accelerates the folding , whereas for other models , it may slow it down .",
    "many models have stressed the analogy between protein folding and the thermodynamics of heteropolymers @xcite . in a mean field approach ,",
    "some models of quenched disordered polymers are similar to a random energy model ( rem ) @xcite ; the low lying states of the protein are identified with the low - lying states of the rem , which are responsible for the slow dynamics . although this analogy is questionable as far as real proteins are concerned @xcite , we will adopt this framework for the dynamical models studied in the following .    for the rem as well as for the sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that i ) all low lying states have the same extensive energy and ii ) the distribution of the corrections to extensivity of their free energies is exponential ( bound at high energy but not at low energy ) .    for proteins ,",
    "the energies are bound below by that of the native state and above by that of a swollen coil . in addition , the energy landscape is known to be very rugged and the number of misfolded states ( at fixed energy @xmath0 ) is known to grow very rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus natural , by analogy with many disordered systems , to assume an exponential distribution for the energies of the lowest lying misfolded states and to isolate the native state below the continuum of energies .    in our model",
    ", we describe the phase space of the protein as consisting of @xmath1 misfolded states @xmath2 with @xmath3 and one native state @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution of energies of the misfolded states is continuous , given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a parameter ( related to the glass transition temperature of the rem ) and @xmath7 is the energy of the highest state .    more precisely , the energy levels are such that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the energy of the first misfolded state . therefore , boltzmann weights @xmath10 vary between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to account for the native state",
    ", we include an additional state with energy @xmath13 and boltzmann weight @xmath14 .    the energy gap @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "the main consequence of the truncation of the energy distribution is that the system will never spend a very large time in one of the energy traps , and that @xmath17 will always relax towards its equilibrium value @xmath18 with a finite relaxation time at large times .",
    "slow dynamics features such as aging wo nt appear either ; this is in contrast with the case when the distribution is not truncated , which has been studied extensively recently @xcite .",
    "the calculations are made by taking first the limit @xmath19 before taking the limit of large times .",
    "this is justified if the number of metastable conformations is large enough .",
    "the dynamics is based on the master equation :    @xmath20    where @xmath17 is the probability of occupation of the energy level @xmath21 at time @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the transition rate from the energy level @xmath24 to the energy level @xmath25 . in all the cases we have studied ,",
    "detailed balance is satisfied : @xmath26    when solving the master equation , the quantities that are usually calculated are averages over the distribution of disorder @xmath27 .",
    "this is justified in the case of a macroscopic system with short range interactions , but not in the case of a protein , which is too small an object for self - averageness to hold .",
    "this is why , in contrast with other studies , we have calculated quantities which are not averaged over the distribution of disorder .",
    "we considered three cases , depending on the choice of transition rates between energy levels .",
    "we find that if the transitions rates depend only on the final state , the relaxation is accelerated by a large gap whereas if they only depend on the initial state , the dynamics is slowed down ; in the intermediate case , the situation is more complex .",
    "in this section , we present the results of the calculations , which will be detailed elsewhere .    studies as the ones presented below have already been made for a non truncated distribution of energies : disorder - averaged quantities show stretched exponential or power law behavior at large times @xcite .",
    "the same models have been used in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of heteropolymer folding .",
    "if @xmath13 and a gap are included in the analysis , the master equation can easily be solved , leading to an exponential behavior , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . since @xmath31 ( the bar denotes the average over the distribution of energies ) , where @xmath32 , the relaxation time is @xmath33 .",
    "let us compare the dynamics of two protein sequences that differ only by their native energies @xmath13 keeping @xmath9 ( or @xmath34 ) constant . as seen above , the relaxation time @xmath35 decreases when the gap @xmath36 increases .",
    "indeed , in such a dynamical scheme , jumps towards the native state are enhanced and the lower its energy , the faster it is populated .",
    "the dynamics is illustrated by fig.[1 ] where the probability of occupation of the native state @xmath37 is plotted for different values of the gap .",
    "on fig.[2 ] , we show the relaxation time as a function of the gap .",
    "0.5 cm      as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to the case of a unique barrier at energy @xmath39 , through which the system must pass in order to make a transition from state @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "calculations can be made in both cases where the initial conditions are uniform ( all states are equally populated ) or delta - like ( the initial probability of occupation of a specific state is one ) .",
    "they lead to the same conclusions concerning the relaxation times , and we give here the results for the case of uniform initial conditions . at short times , the probability of occupation of states follows a power - law : @xmath42 at longer times , the relaxation is exponential . for a non - native state @xmath43 ,    @xmath44 and for the native state ,",
    "@xmath45 these expressions involve two time constants : @xmath46 , which is the relaxation time of the energy level @xmath47 in the absence of a gap , and @xmath48 .",
    "this last relaxation time is the one that governs the long time dynamics of the native state .",
    "contrarily to the previous case , keeping @xmath9 ( or @xmath34 ) fixed , @xmath49 now increases as @xmath36 increases . in this scheme",
    ", the energy landscape can be viewed as a collection of energy traps ; as the energy @xmath4 decreases , it becomes more difficult to escape from this state ; low energy states are populated quite rapidly , and the system remains trapped in the native state ; as a result , the relaxation to the boltzmann distribution is slowed down .",
    "this effect is more pronounced as the energy gap gets bigger ( see fig.[3 ] and [ 4 ] ) .",
    "0.5 cm      in this case , the transition rates depend both on the initial and final state through the above formula , where @xmath51 is a parameter between 0 and 1 .",
    "relaxation to the native state is described by a new relaxation time @xmath49 :    @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath54 on the gap is now slightly more complicated .",
    "one can distinguish two regimes :    1 .",
    "if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath54 decreases as @xmath57 increases ( see fig .",
    "[ 5 ] and [ 6 ] ) , and the relaxation is accelerated . on the other end , if @xmath58 , @xmath54 increases with @xmath15 for @xmath59 and decreases with @xmath36 for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath62 , @xmath54 is an increasing function of @xmath36 for @xmath59 and a decreasing function of @xmath57 for @xmath60 , where @xmath63 .",
    "it seems difficult to compare our results with experiments in real proteins , since no systematic study of the gap of given sequences has been carried out experimentally .",
    "however , there has been a number of lattice simulations that lead to a variety of results and interpretations . klimov and thirumalai @xcite",
    "claim that there seems to be no direct correlation between the gap and the folding dynamics .    on the other hand , sali , shakhnovich and karplus @xcite have shown that the `` best '' folders are those with the largest energy gap . in all cases ,",
    "the simulations are performed on very short chains ( 27 monomers at best ) and the interactions between monomers are random with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the energy of a configuration is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 if monomers @xmath66 and @xmath67 are neighbors on the lattice and @xmath68 with a negative parameter @xmath14 in order to mimic the hydrophobic character of the solvent .",
    "these previous studies are applicable only to very short proteins",
    ". for longer chains , there are no results indicating how a protein will find its folding path through its complicated energy landscape .",
    "some attempts have been made to understand analytically the dynamics of random heteropolymers @xcite @xcite ; and at present , the debate regarding the interpretation of the simulations @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite is still open .    our phenomenological approach based on a rem energy landscape ,",
    "although far from realistic , might capture the long time relaxation laws of random chains .",
    "the finiteness of objects such as proteins is taken into account by truncating the energy spectrum .",
    "moreover , we show that the dynamics depends on the whole energy landscape , rather that only on one parameter , such as the gap .",
    "according to the type of transition rates used in the dynamics , one can obtain different behaviors for the relaxation as a function of the gap .",
    "it seems difficult to decide which one is more realistic .",
    "it would be interesting to have systematic results on the dynamics of synthesized sequences , generated for example through mutation experiments @xcite ."
