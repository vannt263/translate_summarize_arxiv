    "with recent progresses in various quantum systems , such as ion - trap systems  @xcite and solid - state quantum circuits  @xcite , it is now possible to discuss how to establish more efficient quantum networks or so - called quantum internet  @xcite .",
    "the existing studies about quantum communication  @xcite and quantum cryptography  @xcite have shown that quantum network has great advantages to transfer classical or quantum information . however",
    ", how to best transfer information via quantum networks is still an open problem  @xcite .",
    "to transfer quantum information over a large - scale quantum network , a question is : can we allow different pairs of users , who want to transmit information , to share the same channel  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been widely discussed in the field of classical communication  @xcite . in classical communication systems ,",
    "such kind of methods are called channel - access methods or multiple - access methods",
    ". there are mainly four different kinds of multiple - access methods  @xcite : the frequency - division multiple access ( fdma ) methods , the time - division multiple access ( tdma ) methods , the code - division multiple access ( cdma ) methods , and the orthogonal - frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) methods . in fdma methods ,",
    "different frequency bands are assigned to different data streams , while in tdma methods the users split their signals into pieces and transmitted them at different time slots to share the same channel .",
    "tdma and fdma work equally well and are the key techniques for the first generation ( analog ) and the second generation ( digital ) mobile networks . in cdma methods ,",
    "each pair of users shares the same channel and distinguishes with each other by their own unique codes .",
    "it can be shown that cdma can accommodate more bits per channel use , compared with tdma and fdma  @xcite , and thus is used in third - generation mobile communication systems .",
    "however , the interference between different data streams will deteriorate the information rate of cdma .",
    "other competitive approaches are proposed including orthogonal frequency - division multiple - access ( ofdma ) , in which the available subcarriers are divided into several mutually orthogonal subchannels which are assigned to distinct users for simultaneous transmission .",
    "the ofdma is capable of avoiding the interference problem and thus provide better performance in classical _ digital _ communication .",
    "although the multiple - access problem has been widely studied in classical communication , it is considered in quantum communication only recently due to the development of techniques for scalable quantum network . to our knowledge , fdma , or equivalently ,",
    "the so - called wavelength - division multiple access ( wdma ) , has been used for quantum key distribution ( qkd )  @xcite , in which classical information is transmitted over quantum network , and tdma has been used to generate large entangled cluster states  @xcite . however",
    ", whether more popular classical communication technique such as cdma  @xcite and ofdma  @xcite can be applied to quantum communication systems is still an interesting problem yet to be solved .",
    "recently , various protocols are proposed to extend cdma to the quantum case  @xcite and there is evidence showing that cdma can provide higher information rates for quantum communication compared with fdma  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , particular chaotic phase shifts , which work as the unique code in cdma , are introduced to spread the information - bearing quantum signals in the frequency regime .",
    "since the chaotic phase shifts introduced for different users are uncorrelated , the cryptographic quantum signals from different users are orthogonal and thus can be distinguished even when we transmit them via the same channel .",
    "the cryptographic quantum signals can be decoded by introducing reversed chaotic phase shifts at the receiver side , by which the transmitted quantum information can be recovered coherently .",
    "the physical media used in ref .",
    "@xcite to transmit quantum information are single - photon lights  @xcite .",
    "different from the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead of single - photon lights , we use bright coherent lights  @xcite to transmit quantum information over quantum cdma network , which are easier to be realized in experiments .",
    "we find that quantum entanglement can be controllably distributed between two pairs of users sharing a single quantum channel .",
    "we also present the particular design of the chaotic phase shifters used in our proposals by introducing electro - optic modulators ( eoms ) and chaotic colpitts oscillator circuits  @xcite which is not clearly discussed in ref .",
    "the pecora - carrol synchronization technique  @xcite is introduced to generate the reverse chaotic phase shifts at the receiver side .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] , we present the general description of the quantum cdma network , we use to transmit quantum information . in sec .  [ s3 ] , we state how to distribute maximally - entangled quantum states over proposed quantum cdma network mediated by bright coherent lights . in sec .",

    "the main purpose of our work is to generate two maximally - entangled states between two pairs of nodes ( one pair of nodes are node @xmath0 and node @xmath1 and the second pair of nodes are node @xmath2 and node @xmath3 ) via a single quantum channel ( see fig .",

    "the recovered quantum signals are then sent to the two receiver nodes .     and",

    "it can be shown that @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) leads to phase - shift factor @xmath17 @xmath18 $ ] for the optical field . at the receiver side ,",
    "the chaotic phase shifter @xmath19 ( @xmath8 ) induces an opposite hamiltonian @xmath20 @xmath21 $ ] by which a reversed phase - shift factor @xmath22 @xmath23 $ ] is introduced to decode the information - bear signal masked by the chaotic phase shift .",
    "here @xmath24 , @xmath25 . to assure that the chaotic phase shift at the sender side and that at the receiver side can be exactly cancelled , an auxiliary classical channel between node @xmath0 ( node @xmath2 ) and node @xmath1 ( node @xmath3 ) is introduced to synchronize the two chaotic phase shifters @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig of the schematic diagram of quantum multiple access network ] ) .",
    "the whole information transmission process can be represented by the input - output relationship of the whole quantum network from @xmath26 , @xmath27 to @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( see fig .",

    "( [ input - output relationship of the chaotic phase shifters]-[input - output relationship of bs2 ] ) , we can obtain the input - output relationship of the whole quantum network    @xmath36    for the chaotic phase shifts @xmath37 , we should take average over these broadband  random \" phases  @xcite , by which we have : @xmath38  @xcite , where @xmath39.\\ ] ] @xmath40 is the power spectrum density of the signal @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the  lower \" and  upper \" bounds of the frequency band of @xmath41 , respectively . equation  ( [ input - output relationship between the senders and receivers ] ) can then be reduced to @xmath44 the correction factor @xmath45 may become extremely small when @xmath41 is induced by a chaotic signal which has a broadband frequency spectrum .",
    "thus we have @xmath46 , @xmath47 , which means that the quantum signal transmitted from node @xmath0 to node @xmath1 and the quantum signal transmitted from node @xmath2 to node @xmath3 can be totally decoupled from each other although they are transmitted simultaneously on the same quantum channel .",
    "the mechanism of such a quantum multiple access network is that the information bearing fields transmitted on the quantum channel are broadened by the chaotic phase shifters in the frequency regime , which can not be detected unless we can reduce the chaotic phase shifts and sharpen the quantum signal by chaotic synchronization .",
    "this idea is quite similar to the classical cdma communication . that is why we call it quantum cdma network in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the case where the quantum fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 are in the coherent states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the field @xmath50 is in a vacuum state .",

    "( [ input - output relationship between the senders and receiver : reduction ] ) that the output fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the quantum network are in the coherent states @xmath51",

    "it is known that the refractive index of the electro - optic crystal in eom can be varied by changing the voltage @xmath63 acting on it ( see fig .",
    "[ a transverse electro - optical modulator and schematic diagram of the chaotic signal generantion and synchronization device](a ) ) . based on this effect",

    "<S> we present a method for quantum entanglement distribution over a so - called code - division - multiple - access network , in which two pairs of users share the same quantum channel to transmit information . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of this method is to use different broad - band chaotic phase shifts , generated by electro - optic modulators ( eoms ) and chaotic colpitts circuits , to encode the information - bearing quantum signals coming from different users , and then recover the masked quantum signals at the receiver side by imposing opposite chaotic phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic phase shifts given to different pairs of users are almost uncorrelated due to the randomness of chaos and thus the quantum signals from different pair of users can be distinguished even when they are sent via the same quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that two maximally - entangled states can be generated between two pairs of users by our method mediated by bright coherent lights , which can be more easily implemented in experiments compared with single - photon lights . </S>",
    "<S> our method is robust under the channel noises if only the decay rates of the information - bearing fields induced by the channel noises are not quite high . </S>",
    "<S> our study opens up new perspectives for addressing and transmitting quantum information in future quantum networks . </S>"
