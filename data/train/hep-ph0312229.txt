    "@xcite predicted a narrow pentaquark @xmath11 baryon at a mass of 1.53 gev , which forms the baryon antidecuplet with the exotic @xmath14 particle .",
    "such states are also anticipated in su(3 ) skyrme models , which allow all possible su(3 ) representation of baryons @xcite .",
    "although there is no quark degrees of freedom in soliton models , the positive strangeness of the @xmath11 implies the existence of a strange anti - quark in its wavefunction and hence the @xmath11 is interpreted as a pentaquark state in the quark model description .",
    "exotic hadrons have been a challenge for hadron models and they are expected to widen our understanding of the hadron structure @xcite .",
    "viewing pentaquark baryons containing four quarks and one anti - quark , one finds that such baryons can form singlet , octet , decuplet , antidecuplet , 27-plet , and 35-plet , namely , @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : penta ] , where the numbers in parentheses are the number of multiplicity . then the @xmath8 baryon that carries hypercharge @xmath16 can be a member of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 .",

    "thus , the isospin measurement can answer the question in which multiplet the @xmath0 resides . in this respect ,",
    "the saphir experiment @xcite and the hermes experiment @xcite , which report no evidence for a signal of the @xmath27 in the @xmath28 invariant mass distribution in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 reactions , strongly support that the @xmath0 is an isosinglet and hence it belongs to antidecuplet , which is also supported by the @xmath31 scattering data analyses of ref .",
    "the low mass of the exotic @xmath14 states @xcite also seems to support the antidecuplet nature of the @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",

    ", they also considered the mixing of the pentaquark antidecuplet with the pentaquark octet , which makes it different from the su(3 ) soliton models where the octet describes the normal baryon octet . assuming that the nucleon and @xmath36 analogues are in the ideal mixing of the octet and antidecuplet , the nucleon analogue",
    "is then identified as the roper resonance @xmath37 .",
    "can not be a _ pure antidecuplet state _ due to su(3 ) symmetric interactions and @xmath38-spin conservation .",
    "the antidecuplet can not couple to decuplet and meson octet while @xmath39 has a large branching ratio into the @xmath40 channel .",
    "therefore , mixing with other multiplets is required to identify the @xmath39 as a pentaquark crypto - exotic state .",
    "however recent studies on the ideal mixing of antidecuplet with pentaquark octet show that the ideally mixed state still has vanishing coupling with the @xmath40 channel @xcite . ] in these correlated quark configurations , the color - flavor - spin wavefunction analyses favor the even - parity of the @xmath0 , which is consistent with the soliton model prediction .",

    "the parity quantum number is one of the important issues to be settled .",
    "if one assumes that all the quarks of the @xmath11 are in the @xmath43 wave ground state , it is natural to expect the odd - parity for @xmath11 @xcite . however , if the quarks are strongly correlated , the @xmath44 wave state is expected to have a lower energy so that the observed @xmath11 has even - parity @xcite , which is consistent with the soliton model prediction @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the quark potential model calculations @xcite , where the flavor - spin interaction plays an important role to give a lower mass to the @xmath44 wave state . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to recall the models for heavy pentaquarks , where an issue is whether the non - strange heavy pentaquarks like @xmath45 and @xmath46 are stable against strong decays @xcite . in the bound state model of skyrmion @xcite ,",
    "such heavy pentaquarks are described as soliton ",
    "heavy - meson bound states .",
    "although the @xmath11 can not be a bound state of @xmath31 @xcite , a system like @xmath47 or @xmath48 can form bound states due to the heavy mass of @xmath49 and @xmath50 mesons .",

    "the @xmath5 production is dominantly in forward angles while for the @xmath4 , the production is peaked near the 45 degrees .",

    "[ fig : trx ] .",
    "these asymmetries for the proton targets , in particular , are very sensitive to the parity of the @xmath11 , as their dependence on the @xmath12 interaction is relatively weak because of the absence of @xmath5 exchange in @xmath65-channel . in order to understand the behavior of those asymmetries ,",
    "let us consider the helicity amplitudes in the @xmath65-channel @xmath4 exchange .",
    "the amplitudes contain @xmath175 where @xmath176 s are the pauli spinors and @xmath177 and @xmath178 are some functions of the mandelstam variables .",
    "then in the c.m .",
    "frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cm ] ) , @xmath179 , and at @xmath180 so that @xmath181 , we have @xmath182 \\chi_\\theta^\\dagger \\sigma_3 \\chi_n^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\left [ a_1(s , t , u ) + a_2(s , t , u ) \\right ] m_i^ { } \\delta_{m_i^{},m_f^ { } } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\bar{u}_\\theta^{}(p',m_f^ { } ) u_n^{}(p , m_i^ { } ) & \\propto & \\left [ b_1 ( s , t , u ) + b_2(s , t , u ) \\right ] \\chi_\\theta^\\dagger \\chi_n^ { } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left [ b_1 ( s , t , u ) + b_2(s , t , u ) \\right ] \\delta_{m_i^{},m_f^{}}. \\label{limit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , since @xmath183 in the form of @xmath184 , where the sum over the other helicities is understood , and using eq .",
    "( [ limit ] ) at @xmath185 , we can find that @xmath9 has different sign depending on the parity of the @xmath11 and @xmath186 at @xmath180 .",
    "this conclusion holds also at @xmath187 .",
    "thus the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trx ] can be understood in this kinematic region .",
    "of course , these results should be modified to some extent by including @xmath154 interactions , but the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : trx ] show that it does not change so much for the case of the proton targets at least in the forward scattering region . however , for the neutron targets , the interference between the two interactions is large so that the results are dependent on the @xmath100 coupling constant .",
    "although the target - recoil double asymmetries are very sensitive to the parity of the @xmath11 , experimental measurements of those asymmetries would be very hard because of the difficulties with identifying the helicity of @xmath11 .",
    "we now consider the parity asymmetry @xmath188 and the photon asymmetry @xmath189 in @xmath140 .",
    "these asymmetries can be measured by observing the decay angular distribution of the @xmath190 vector meson produced by linearly polarized photon beams @xcite .",
    "if we define @xmath191 and @xmath192 as the cross sections for symmetric decay particle pairs , i.e. , kaon and pion pairs , produced parallel and normal to the photon polarization plane respectively , the photon polarization asymmetry @xmath189 is defined by @xmath193 which can be related to the density matrix elements of the @xmath5 vector meson ( when produced by linearly polarized photon beam ) as @xmath194 the definitions for the density matrix @xmath195 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another interesting quantity is the parity asymmetry @xmath188 .",
    "this can be defined by decomposing the helicity amplitudes as @xmath196 or @xmath197 this decomposition is from the observation that if only natural parity [ @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the parity and spin of the exchanged particle ] or only unnatural parity [ @xmath201 exchange in the @xmath65-channel contributes , one has an additional symmetry to leading order in the incoming photon energy @xcite , @xmath202 where the upper ( lower ) sign applies to natural ( unnatural ) parity exchange",
    ". then one can decompose the cross sections due to natural and unnatural parity exchanges , i.e. , signature of the exchanged particle , and the parity asymmetry is defined as @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are the contributions of natural and unnatural parity exchanges to the cross section , and we have written @xmath188 in terms of the density matrix elements .",
    "so when we have natural parity exchange ( like @xmath5 exchange ) only , we get @xmath206 and we expect @xmath207 for unnatural parity exchange ( like @xmath4 exchange ) only .",
    "note also that the relation ( [ addsym ] ) is exact in large energy limit and that there can be some modifications at low energies .",
    "nevertheless , this quantity can give some information on the dominant @xmath65-channel exchange process .",
    "in helicity conserving processes , the two asymmetries , @xmath189 and @xmath188 , have similar values as in our case .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pol ] are our predictions for the asymmetries @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "since they are very sensitive to the spin - parity of the exchanged particle , we can extract informations on the nature of the production mechanisms .",
    "for example , if we turn off @xmath12 interaction by setting @xmath151 , we have only @xmath65-channel @xmath4 exchange .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath207 in this case for both @xmath208 and @xmath29 reactions .",
    "when @xmath209 , we get @xmath65-channel @xmath5 exchange in the @xmath150 reaction , which is , however , not allowed in the @xmath210 reaction . in both cases , of course , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channel diagrams can make @xmath188 deviate from @xmath211 , which however does not change the sign of @xmath188 in the forward scattering angles .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath188 varies between @xmath212 and @xmath173 depending on the relative size of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 exchanges in the @xmath150 reaction , while @xmath188 is close to @xmath212 in the @xmath29 reaction at the forward scattering angles .",
    "so measuring @xmath188 for the @xmath150 reaction can give an information on the size of the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "if it is close to @xmath173 , the @xmath12 coupling would be large and @xmath5 exchange is the dominant process in @xmath150 reaction . if it is close to @xmath212 , however , it implies small value of @xmath213 .",
    "therefore , measurement of this quantity can test the quark model predictions on @xmath214 that has very different values depending on the parity of @xmath11 .",
    "the recently observed @xmath0 is believed to be a member of the baryon antidecuplet , but its spin and parity are not confirmed yet .",
    "careful analyses on various @xmath11 production processes are thus expected to give informations on the properties of the @xmath0 and test various models for hadron structure . as a continuation of our efforts to understand the @xmath11 production processes @xcite",
    ", we have investigated cross sections and spin asymmetries of the @xmath140 reaction in this paper as a complementary process of @xmath215 . in this calculation , the spin of the @xmath0 is assumed to be 1/2 and the results are obtained for different assumptions for the parity of the @xmath11 . the obtained cross sections for @xmath140 are found to be comparable to those for @xmath215 .",
    "our results also show that the cross sections for even - parity @xmath11 is much larger than those for odd - parity @xmath11 at least by an order of magnitude .",
    "more solid information for the parity of the observed @xmath0 could be obtained from the measurements of spin asymmetries .",
    "indeed , within the uncertainties due to the model - dependence of the production mechanisms and the lack of information on several coupling constants , we found that some target - recoil double asymmetries are sensitive to the parity of the @xmath11 at forward scattering angles .",
    "but it would be very hard to be measured experimentally because of the difficulties in identifying the nucleon polarization in @xmath11 decay distribution , which is needed to know the helicity of the @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the spin asymmetries depend not only on the parity of @xmath11 but also on the dynamics of the production mechanisms",
    ". thus it would be necessary to measure various spin asymmetries on the proton and neutron targets in order to study the production mechanisms and the parity of @xmath11 . among various spin asymmetries ,",
    "the parity asymmetry @xmath188 in the @xmath150 reaction can give a robust information for the dominant @xmath65-channel exchange and can be a clean signal for the @xmath12 interaction .",
    "once we know the strength of the @xmath12 interaction at least qualitatively , we can then learn more about the production processes and the parity of @xmath11 by measuring other spin asymmetries such as single asymmetries and beam - target double asymmetries . when combined with the quark model predictions which lead to @xmath216 ( @xmath212 ) for positive ( negative ) parity @xmath11 in @xmath150 reaction , estimation of the @xmath154 interaction",
    "may also give a clue for the parity of @xmath11 .",
    "such experiments should be possible at current experimental facilities .",
