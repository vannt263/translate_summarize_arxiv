    "the comprehensive investigation of the `` @xmath17 '' atomistic model for heat flow carried out by aoki and kusnezov @xcite showed that this model behaves `` normally '' , even in one space dimension .",
    "heat flows through a chain of @xmath17 particles according to fourier s law @xcite , @xmath18 .",
    "thus this model can provide good test cases for the logarithmic oscillator thermostat .",
    "the model we investigate here is a periodic chain of 20 one - dimensional particles .",
    "two are `` log - thermostat '' particles , characterized by their individual specified `` thermostat temperatures '' @xmath19 , and interacting with their lattice sites @xmath20 with a logarithmic potential : @xmath21 the remaining eighteen are @xmath17 particles , tethered to their lattice sites @xmath20 with a _",
    "quartic _ potential : @xmath22 in addition to these two types of lattice - site potentials all 20 nearest - neighbor pairs interact with a hookes - law potential , @xmath23 because the log - thermostat model is imagined to be `` weakly coupled '' to the chain we considered a model with a much smaller force constant @xmath24 linking the two thermostat particles to their four neighbors in the chain .",
    "experiments with @xmath25 showed no tendency at all towards equilibration with simulations of @xmath15 time steps . with initial velocities",
    "@xmath26 alternating along the chain the longtime averaged temperatures along the chain reflect the initial conditions rather than the thermostat temperatures , ending up with all the time - averaged kinetic temperatures near @xmath27 .",
    "the log - thermostats are apparently unable to absorb much energy in a reasonable time @xcite .",
    "equilibrium simulations with alternating initial velocities @xmath28 along the chain and with both specified thermostat temperatures equal to @xmath29 were more nearly successful . figure [ eq ] shows that the time - averaged kinetic temperatures along the chain are within 8% of the specified temperature @xmath29 after a simulation of @xmath15 time steps , corresponding to a time of one million in reduced units .",
    "evidently , under propitious conditions log - thermostat temperature control _ can _ approach equilibrium on a sufficiently long timescale .",
    "we next carried out a similar , but _",
    "nonequilibrium _ simulation , with the same initial conditions but with different specified thermostat temperatures : @xmath30 for thermostat particle 5 and @xmath31 for thermostat particle 15 .",
    "the temperature profile which resulted ( again with @xmath15 fourth - order runge - kutta time steps ) was scarcely different to the equilibrium one ( see figure [ neq ] ) .",
    "the log - thermostats were _ unable _ to provide a nonequilibrium temperature profile .",
    "but why do logarithmic thermostats fail ?",
    "apart from the large time intervals mentioned above @xcite , there is another more fundamental reason for their failure in _ nonequilibrium _ problems , traceable to their hamiltonian heritage @xcite : deterministic nonequilibrium heat - flow problems generate _ fractal _ phase - space distributions , with a vanishing phase volume .",
    "a hamiltonian system obeying liouville s theorem in phase space , @xmath32 , simply _ can not _",
    "produce a fractal .",
    "aoki and kusnezov showed that heat flow through a @xmath17 chain generates fractal phase - space distributions , with a dimensionality reduced from the equilibrium gibbs distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that similar fractals result using seven different thermostat types ( none of which obeys the equilibrium version of liouville s theorem ) .",
    "even the original one - dimensional simulations proposed by campisi _",
    "et alii _ for a couple of particles turn out to imply very long simulation times .",
    "we carried out simulations with one and two particles setting the mass of the logarithmic oscillator equal to ten particle masses .",
    "a classic fourth - order runge - kutta integrator took @xmath33 time steps to generate a reasonable reproduction of the energy histogram presented in @xcite ( see figure [ densities ] ) .    in their discussion of a three - dimensional simulation , campisi _",
    "et alii _ pointed out that an increase in the number of particles led to a very significant departure from the predicted velocity distribution .",
    "the solution suggested was simply to increase the total energy of the system by @xmath34 .",
    "this solution , however , leads to the exponential increase in the typical lengths and times for the logarithmic oscillator that we have already explained above .",
    "our investigations reveal that unless the initial conditions and the problem are carefully `` tuned '' the thermostat is ineffective at equilibrium , even for extraordinarily long simulation times .",
    "the situation away from equilibrium is worse yet , as the thermostat fails to act rapidly enough to affect change .",
    "we conclude that log - thermostats are not useful in most practical applications , whether simulations or experiments .",
    "we would like to thank campisi _",
    "et alii _ for correcting a mistake in the previous version of this article @xcite .",
    "our comment was published in physical review letters on the 11@xmath35 january 2013 @xcite , followed by a reply @xcite where campisi and his colleagues proposed a new experimental arrangement for the logarithmic oscillator , without the unreasonable time or length scales that we had described .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom in the original experiment was reduced to one third by forcing the neutral atoms and logarithmic oscillator ion to move along a single dimension .",
    "table [ campisi - table ] , taken from the reply , illustrates the exponential growth of mean free times @xmath36 and box lengths @xmath0 as the required precision @xmath37 or the number of particles @xmath7 increase .",
    "campisi _ et alii _ claimed that this version of the experiment could be implemented with present day cold - atom technology @xcite . having no prior experience with cold - atom physics",
    ", we contacted prof . i. bloch , who kindly lent us some of his time and confirmed that such a precise one - dimensional setup , though `` challenging '' , should be feasible in principle .",
    "we are grateful for his helpful comments .",
    "although the magnitudes shown in the table are correct , they are slightly misleading because they assume that the system of interest begins at ( or very near ) the `` thermostat temperature '' .",
    "however , if we assume that the initial temperature is off by @xmath38 degrees , then the logarithmic oscillator will have to absorb at least @xmath39 units of energy . for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "for example , the energy absorbed must be about @xmath42 .",
    "compare this value to those in the table , where the total energy of system plus oscillator never exceeds @xmath43 .",
    ".total energy , box lengths and mean free times for the logarithmic oscillator experiment as a function of the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath7 , and the required precision , @xmath37 , measured as a kolmogorov - smirnov distance ( from campisi _ et alii _",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      logarithmic oscillators indeed `` possess an infinite heat capacity '' , but this statement is easily misunderstood .",
    "the logarithmic oscillator s mean kinetic temperature is not a function of its energy ( if one considers time averages with intervals that are very large compared to the period of oscillation ) . in practice , though , a logarithmic oscillator _ can not _ absorb an arbitrary amount of heat because any physical potential will lack a singularity at the origin and the size of the experiment , @xmath0 , will limit the amount of energy that the oscillator may absorb , so that @xmath44 which is an extremely slowly growing function of @xmath0 .",
    "our comment pointed out that applying _ two _ logarithmic oscillators , with different temperatures , to a chaotic hamiltonian system failed to create the expected linear temperature gradient . in their reply ,",
    "campisi _ et alii _ disregarded this observation , arguing that their letter suggested temperatures that varied in time and not in space , so that our simulations were not relevant to their work .",
    "this conclusion strikes us as ill - conceived . unless they can somehow explain how to change a system s temperature _ homogeneously _",
