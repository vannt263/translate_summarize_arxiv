    "is unique among globular clusters in the milky way in that its member stars exhibit a wide spread in metallicity @xcite .",
    "this has led to the general belief that  was chemically self - enriched , while the other clusters were not ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) . in this context , it is often noted that  is the most massive globular cluster in the milky way and thus possibly the most capable of retaining its own stellar ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the globular cluster g1 in the halo of the andromeda galaxy has similar properties ; it appears to be self - enriched and is also one of the most massive clusters in its host galaxy @xcite .",
    "has several other intriguing and potentially related properties .",
    "the metal - rich stellar population is more centrally concentrated and has a lower velocity dispersion than the metal - poor population @xcite .",
    "moreover , the metal - rich population has no detectable rotation , while the metal - poor population rotates relatively rapidly ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) , consistent with the apparent flattening of the cluster , which is among the highest of all globular clusters in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the metal - rich stellar population also appears to be younger than the metal - poor population , consistent with the idea of self - enrichment over a period @xmath2 gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is supported by the large enhancement in s - process elements in the metal - rich population relative to that in globular clusters with similar metallicities @xcite .",
    "these properties have led to the suggestion that  managed to retain the ejecta from the first generation of stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , which then formed a centrally concentrated , metal - enriched , younger generation of stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that  is not special in the ability to retain its own stellar ejecta .",
    "the escape speed in is not the highest among the galactic globular clusters .",
    "we find that more than half of the clusters could retain at least 20% of their agb winds .",
    "it is therefore surprising that  is the only globular cluster in the milky way to show signs of self - enrichment .",
    "we conclude that this cluster could not have evolved in isolation on its present orbit in the galaxy and that it must have been substantially different in the past .",
    "we discuss other models suggested previously , including the idea that  is the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that lost its outer envelop by tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "to compute the escape velocities of galactic globular clusters , we use the photometric data from the catalog by @xcite . out of 147 clusters in the catalog ,",
    "we choose 141 for which the data are available on the distance , integrated magnitude , core radius , and concentration parameter .",
    "all clusters are fit by single - mass isotropic king models with a constant mass - to - light ratio , @xmath3 in solar units .",
    "first , we check that the photometric models are consistent with the directly measured central velocity dispersions for a sample of 56 clusters from @xcite , their table 2 .",
    "the most reliable estimates of the dispersion are based on individual stellar radial velocities , but these estimates depend on the position of stars relative to the cluster center .",
    "the core velocity dispersion of  is 17 km s@xmath1 @xcite , with the indication that it rises in the center up to 25 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we thus avoid a direct comparison and show instead in figure 1 two separate histograms of the central velocity dispersions as inferred from the photometric models and as measured directly .",
    "the distributions are qualitatively similar . also , the photometric model of  predicts a central velocity dispersion of about 17 km s@xmath1 , the same as the observed value",
    ".    1 distribution of the central line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the galactic globular clusters , as inferred from the photometric models ( left panel ) and observed spectroscopically ( right panel ) .",
    "the arrows point to the velocity dispersion of .",
    "1.1    [ fig : histo ]    we note that in the past 20 years there has been only one study @xcite providing homogeneous velocity dispersion measurements for a significant number of clusters .",
    "now , with the availability of large - field survey spectrographs such data should be easier to obtain and would provide a very useful constraint on the mass models of globular clusters .",
    "having calibrated the photometric models , we can use them to determine the escape velocity .",
    "this is calculated using the reduced gravitational potential , @xmath4 , in the center ( giving the maximum escape velocity ) and at the half - mass radius ( providing a threshold for most stars ) . here ,",
    "the tidal potential @xmath5 accounts for truncation at the tidal radius .    figures 2 and 3 demonstrate that  is not special in its escape velocity .",
    "there are 11 clusters with higher @xmath6 and 8 clusters with higher @xmath7 .",
    "we also find that the ratio of the central escape velocity to the central velocity dispersion can be fit by a simple relation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the concentration of the king models .",
    "the fit is accurate to 3% in the range @xmath10 .",
    "we now calculate the fraction of agb winds retained by a cluster as a function of the wind velocity @xmath11 .",
    "we integrate the distribution function of stars , @xmath12 , over the phase space volume within which the total velocity of the wind particles is below the escape speed at the star s position : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a solid angle of the wind velocity @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a unit step function .    2 central escape velocity for 141 galactic globular clusters vs their mass @xmath17 .",

    "the escape velocity is calculated from the photometric single - mass king models with @xmath3 .",

    "is denoted by an asterisk .",
    "3.3    [ fig : vesch ]    figure 4 shows the result for clusters of various concentration parameters , from @xmath18 to 2.4 .",
    "the fraction @xmath19 declines gradually and even the clusters with @xmath20 can retain 10 to 20% of their winds . since according to @xcite the characteristic terminal velocity of agb winds is @xmath21 km s@xmath1 (",
    "although a velocity as high as 90 km s@xmath1 has been measured for a field red giant by @xcite ) , more than half of the galactic clusters should be able to retain a sizable fraction of their winds .    4 fraction of agb winds retained by clusters of concentration @xmath9 ( marked by numbers ) as a function of the wind velocity in units of the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the top solid line shows the model with the highest binding energy ( @xmath22 ) , the dotted ( @xmath18 ) and dashed ( @xmath23 ) curves give the lower bounds .",
    "all models with intermediate concentrations fall between the plotted lines . for all concentrations ,",
    "the fraction can be fit reasonably accurately by @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "the question now is : could  ( and other clusters ) retain the wind material throughout their evolution in the galaxy ? the oldest stars in the galactic disk",
    "are dated to be at least @xmath25 gyr old @xcite .",
    "the age of the universe is determined fortuitously well from the coincidental cmb correlation @xcite to be @xmath26 gyr .",
    "thus , it is quite possible that the dense gaseous disk was already assembled when the universe was about 4 gyr old , equal to the age spread of stars in . if this was the case , ram pressure of the disk would strip any gas left in , as we show below .",
    "the current galactocentric velocity of  from the recently measured proper motion @xcite is relatively low : @xmath27 km s@xmath1 , @xmath28 km s@xmath1 , @xmath29 km s@xmath1 , with the uncertainty @xmath30 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the speed of only 70 km s@xmath1 makes the cluster strongly bound and thus , its present position at 6.3 kpc from the galactic center is likely to be close to the orbital apocenter .",
    "indeed , calculations of @xcite give the pericenter distance @xmath31 kpc and the apocenter distance @xmath32 kpc .",
    "therefore  remains close enough to the galactic center to pass through the disk twice in each orbital period , which is relatively short , @xmath33 yr .",
    "we calculate the amount of gas that might have been present in as follows .",
    "the total mass - loss rate of agb stars depends on the slope of the imf between 1 and 8 @xmath34 , @xmath35 , on the mass of the white dwarf remnant , @xmath36 , and on the main sequence lifetimes of stars , @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inversion of the function @xmath40 .",
    "we consider two cases , @xmath41 ( following @xcite ) and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "using the code of @xcite , we calculate @xmath40 for the oldest stars in , with the metallicity @xmath43=-1.7 $ ] , and find that in the mass range of interest it is well fit by @xmath44 yr .",
    "the masses of stellar remnants have been determined observationally in the nearby star clusters @xcite , and the result can be accurately fit by @xmath45 . combining all these expressions , we find the mass - loss rate at the age of 4 gyr : @xmath46 gyr@xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the present mass of the cluster .",
    "( interestingly , the mass - loss rate is almost the same for both values @xmath41 and @xmath42 . ) thus , in half the orbital period the cluster would accumulate @xmath48 of gas .    we integrate the orbit of  backward in time using an accurate galactic potential that fits most observational constraints of the milky way ( model @xmath49 of @xcite ) .",
    "we model the evolution of the galaxy starting with a spherical halo 14 gyr ago , compress the baryons into the disk and the bulge over an exponential timescale of 3 gyr and then turn them into stars over the next 3 gyr .",
    "the bulge is gradually converted into the present flattened shape .",
    "we find the locations where the cluster crosses the plane of the disk and then compare the ram pressure of the disk gas with the restoring gravitational force per unit area at the half - mass radius of . in many passages @xmath50 and",
    "therefore the agb ejecta should be stripped from the cluster .",
    "also , the current mass of  is too small for dynamical friction to affect the orbit .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that if ( 1 )  had formed in isolation with its present mass , and ( 2 ) the galactic disk was in place prior to the formation of the metal - rich stars , then the cluster would encounter the disk gas in its orbital motion and lose the gas accumulated from the enriched agb winds .",
    "the same argument applies to all globular clusters within 10 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "they could not have formed stars from the material enriched by s - process elements .",
    "alternatively , if all the stars in the oldest globular clusters form prior to the assembly of the galactic disk , then  must be unrealistically special .",
    "why did it retain its enriched gas and formed new populations of stars over 4 gyr whereas a few dozen other clusters , capable of doing so , did not . as we have shown , even though  is the most massive cluster its potential well is similar to many others .",
    "so we are left again with the puzzle of why  is different from all other galactic globular clusters .",
    "_ we conclude that it is highly unlikely that  formed and evolved in isolation and enriched itself with heavy elements of the agb winds . _",
    "in light of the unusual properties of , it is becoming a popular scenario that the cluster may be the core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the attraction is that a continuous infall of gas to the center of the dwarf galaxy may lead to a variable star formation history .",
    "@xcite has shown that dwarf galaxies split on the plot of the central surface brightness vs core radius into dense de galaxies ( like m32 ) with the central velocity dispersion @xmath51 in excess of 50 km s@xmath1 , and diffuse dsph galaxies ( like draco ) with @xmath52 km s@xmath1 .",
    "tidal stripping of the outer envelope would decrease the total luminosity of the dwarf galaxy but would not significantly change its core properties , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the cores of de would have too high a velocity dispersion and the cores of dsph would have too low density to count as globular clusters .",
    "the counter - examples to this rule are nucleated dsph galaxies , sometimes classified as de , n @xcite .",
    "ngc 205 @xcite has a core velocity dispersion of 30 km s@xmath1 , dropping to 15 km s@xmath1 in the bright compact nucleus @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered sagittarius galaxy apparently has a globular cluster m54 positioned at its center @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite detected five ultra - compact dwarf galaxies in the fornax cluster of galaxies , which are brighter than globular clusters but almost as compact .",
    "they could be the result of mergers of young star clusters , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if the nuclei of these galaxies , when stripped of their envelopes , would have similar kinematic and chemical properties to .",
    "also , detailed orbital calculations are necessary to determine if the cluster can be brought in to its present location near the galactic center ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the uniqueness of  among the galactic globular clusters still poses unanswered questions . in the hierarchical formation scenario",
    "we expect a few dozen progenitor galaxies to make up the milky way .",
    "if  did in fact form at the center of one of them , why did not other almost as massive clusters form in the other progenitors and have similar chemical enrichment ?",
    "were they entirely disrupted or was the history of  completely different ?",
    "we intend to address these issues in forthcoming work .",
