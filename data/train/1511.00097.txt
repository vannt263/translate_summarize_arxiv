    "another example , which will be the main subject of this paper , is a modification of the well - known potential @xmath4 in @xmath5 obtained by adding a rotationally symmetric negative component which becomes stronger with the growing radius , see below . recall that without the negative component this potential and its modifications serves to demonstrate the possibility of a purely discrete spectrum in the situation when the classically a !",
    "llowed volume of the phase space is infinite @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the spectral transition comes from the balance between the negative part of the potential and the positive contribution to the energy coming from the transverse confinement to a channel narrowing towards infinity .",
    "this means that the behavior of the two potential components at large distances from the origin must be properly correlated . in our case",
    "this is achieved by considering the following class of operators , @xmath6 on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 in @xmath5 are the cartesian coordinates @xmath8 in @xmath5 and the non - negative parameter @xmath3 in the second term of the potential will serve to control the transition . note that @xmath9 , and consequently , the operator ( [ operator ] ) is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath10 by faris - lavine theorem ",
