    "to construct physically viable sources of the gamma in order to investigate their behavior `` at the boundary of the no - hair theorem '' one needs to chose a matter model and then integrate the coupled einstein+matter field equations .",
    "however , this proved by now to be impossible in the non - spherical case ( also in the case of the schwarzschild field few exact interior solutions are known ) .",
    "we thus need a simplifying assumption which however should restrain as little as possible the physical significance of the results .",
    "there is , in fact , the famous argument known as `` synge trick '' which proposes to `` guess '' the metric from general considerations and then to evaluate the matter content from einstein equations ; however , usually such `` synge solutions '' have nothing to do with physics .",
    "the idea we follow here traces back to work by hernandez @xcite and it is based on deformations of physically valid spherically symmetric solutions . we interpret here these deformations as actual changes in the shape of the objects , i.e. we use @xmath90 as the deformation parameter . +",
    "as far as we are aware the unique known examples of interior solution for the gamma are that given by stewart et al . @xcite .",
    "one of this solution is based on the schwarzschild constant density interior solution as a `` seed '' , but the resulting density is not strictly decreasing from the center at higher orders and therefore the solution can not be stable with respect to radial perturbations .",
    "the second one is based on the adler interior solution .",
    "+ in order to construct a new interior solution we take here a different point of view . rather than searching for a solution generated by a `` seed '' to lowest order",
    ", we consider a `` variation of the mass '' of the gamma metric , namely , that family of interior solutions which is obtained by ( a priori ) any inhomogeneous distribution of mass which generates the vacuum gamma field at a fixed boundary .",
    "it is obvious , that not all the mass distributions will be physically viable , and indeed we shall see that the space of allowed functions is severely restricted by physical conditions . + it is well known that an interior solution generating the schwarzschild field can be obtained from the vacuum metric putting @xmath91 .",
    "the einstein tensor then becomes : @xmath92 so that the matching , regularity and energy conditions @xmath93 can easily be satisfied , for instance , by a matter distribution of the form @xmath94 note that the energy condition @xmath95 holds identically for all @xmath96 .",
    "+ we now apply the same reasoning to the gamma . considering @xmath97 to first order in @xmath90",
    "the vacuum metric becomes : @xmath98 so that taking the schwarzschild interior solution as the order zero interior solution is possible to build an interior of the form @xmath99 matching conditions require @xmath100 while regularity conditions for @xmath101 require @xmath102 now the energy conditions have to be imposed .",
    "it turns out that a suitable solution which satisfies the weak energy conditions can be found only for @xmath63 , i.e. for oblate sources .",
    "+ the first energy condition , namely @xmath103 , is satisfied automatically for all @xmath104 if the corresponding condition for schwarzschild is satisfied . in @xmath105",
    "the order zero condition vanishes and so @xmath106_{r = r_{b}}\\geq 0 $ ] must be imposed . from this",
    "follows : @xmath107 in the same way conditions @xmath108 and @xmath109 are satisfied automatically for all @xmath110 and so only @xmath111_{r=0}\\geq 0 $ ] and @xmath112_{r=0}\\geq 0 $ ] must be imposed .",
    "the first is however satisfied by means of the regularity condition for @xmath113 while the second leads to @xmath114 finally the condition that must be satisfied for every @xmath96 and @xmath74 is @xmath115 it is easy to check that the latter is satisfied in @xmath116 and @xmath105 if the previous conditions are satisfied and so , by continuity it must be satisfied in a neighborhood of those two points . taking an appropriate function @xmath117 so that @xmath118 and @xmath119 are small compared to @xmath120 for all @xmath74 satisfies the condition everywhere .",
    "explicit examples of choices of @xmath121 and @xmath117 satisfying the conditions are given in the appendix .",
    "however we show in the figures the behavior of the energy density and the critical energy condition for one of such examples describing a compact object with @xmath122 and @xmath123 .     and",
    "( b ) the condition @xmath124 ( in the adimensional unit obtained multiplying by @xmath125 ) for a fixed value of @xmath126 in dependence of @xmath74 and the adimensional radial variable @xmath127_. ]     and ( b ) the condition @xmath124 ( in the adimensional unit obtained multiplying by @xmath125 ) for a fixed value of @xmath126 in dependence of @xmath74 and the adimensional radial variable @xmath127_. ]    discussion and conclusions[sec : n ]    general relativity is in principle the `` final theory '' for the description of macroscopic gravitating objects .",
    "it is therefore odd enough that after nearly a century from its invention we do not have even one sound model of a star within the theory .",
    "in fact no solution of stationary axially symmetric einstein field equation in matter is known , which is able to represent a finite non singular rotating object . even in the simpler case of",
    "static , but not spherical , gravitating objects very little is known .",
    "of course this case is the non rotating limit of the previous one , since it is only in the case of the perfect fluid that the static object must be spherical , and rotating stars are not to be expected to be made out of perfect fluids .",
    "for instance it is very well known that anisotropy plays a relevant role @xcite in the structure of compact objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "+ so motivated we investigated here a simple static but not spherically symmetric model of a compact object , showing the existence of physically valid solutions of einstein field equations describing it .",
    "+ this model should allow for studying the dynamic behavior of the compact object close to the surface @xmath128 .",
    "this may be done , either by considering the dynamic equation just after the system leaves the equilibrium @xcite or by calculating the active gravitational ( tolman ) mass as the system leaves the equilibrium @xcite . in either case",
    "the bifurcation between the exactly spherically symmetric case and the gamma solution , should appear even for very small values of @xmath36 , if @xmath129 is sufficiently close to @xmath130 .",
    "+ however , observe that specific constraints appear in our model on the value of @xmath129 . indeed",
    ", the central radial pressure is given by @xmath131 which is consistent with the small departure from spherical symmetry approximation if @xmath132 since both @xmath133 and @xmath134 diverge as @xmath135 , the pressure blows up in that limit .",
    "we must therefore consider an upper limit in the surface gravitational potential for which the model is acceptable .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied to the `` arbitrary '' positive constant @xmath86 .",
    "in fact once the scale given by @xmath90 is fixed the value of @xmath86 must not exceed a limit value for which the approximation holds .",
    "+ given the fact that @xmath136 maybe it is better to say that once we fix the value of @xmath129 ( and so @xmath137 ) the possible values of @xmath90 become fixed as well .",
    "so that for @xmath135 we must have @xmath138 , and the more we depart from spherical symmetry the less the value allowed for @xmath129 becomes .",

    "<S> this problem has an interesting theoretical counterpart which is unsolved as well . </S>",
    "<S> it is the problem of finding sources for the rotating blackhole solution under conditions of physical reasonableness . besides its obvious intrinsic interest , </S>",
    "<S> finding this kind of solutions would allow physicist to investigate those interesting phenomena which can be expected to occur `` at the boundary '' between the singularity theorems and the blackhole no - hair theorem . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we do not know anything about those processes which should produce the progressive `` cuts of the hairs '' required to bring a non - vacuum , non singular rotating and collapsing configuration to settle down to a kerr state before ( naked ) singularity formation . </S>",
    "<S> of course the same question arises in the problem of collapse of a non - rotating source of a schwarzschild black hole , which according to the israel theorem @xcite is the only static asymptotically flat vacuum solution to the einstein s equations with a regular horizon . in order to delve deeper into these questions , we present here an interior solution which satisfies all physically relevant requirements and matches smoothly on the boundary surface to one of the static axially symmetric vacuum solutions @xcite known as the gamma metric @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this metric belongs to the family of weyl s solutions , and is continuously linked to the schwarzschild space - time through one of its parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for this choice stems from the fact that the exterior gamma metric corresponds to a solution of the laplace equation ( in cylindrical coordinates ) with the same singularity structure as the schwarzschild solution ( a line segment ) . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the gamma metric appears as the `` natural '' generalization of schwarzschild space - time to the axisymmetric case . </S>",
    "<S> this new interior adds to the few other known sources of the gamma metric @xcite and would allow to study the behavior of very compact self - gravitating systems , which according to the israel theorem are very sensitive to small fluctuations of spherical symmetry .    </S>",

    "<S> + thus , if we are considering vacuum gravitational fields ( so that ricci is zero ) or if the matter source satisfies to @xmath6 then one can make use of the so called _ weyl gauge_. this consists in changing variables @xmath7 where @xmath8 is harmonic and @xmath9 is its harmonic conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the metric can be written as follows : @xmath10+\\varrho^2e^{-2\\lambda}d\\varphi^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 in the present section we shall consider only metrics satisfying the weyl gauge ( the physical content of this condition will be discussed in next section ) . </S>",

    "<S> . there is , therefore , a one to one correspondence between solutions of the laplace equation on flat two dimensional space and vacuum , static , axially symmetric spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic flatness requires vanishing of @xmath24 at space infinity , and the general solution of laplace equation is thus of the form @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are legendre s polynomials . </S>",

    "<S> + as we have seen the gamma metric is originated - formally - by the solution of the laplace equation for a line bar of constant density . </S>",
