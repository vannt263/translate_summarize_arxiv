    "artificial materials known as metamaterials can exhibit a range of unique electromagnetic properties that are not observed in naturally occuring materials .",
    "obtaining a negative index of refraction is particularly desirable , as negative - index materials ( nim ) have many potential applications including imaging beyond the diffraction limit and optical cloaking .",
    "although nim were characterized by veselago @xcite many years ago , it is only recently that we have seen a sudden burst in interest in nim design and applications .",
    "pendry @xcite showed that perfect subwavelength imaging or superlensing would be possible with a nim of refractive index @xmath2 .",
    "the exciting idea here is that imaging would be limited not by the wavelength of light , but by the quality of the lense .",
    "double negative materials and nim were shortly thereafter experimentally realized in the work of smith and coworkers @xcite .",
    "in addition , the functional range of nim has been driven to visible frequencies by shalaev by incorporating the visible - range electromagnetic resonances of metallic nanoparticles into nim design @xcite . in practice ,",
    "sufficient conditions to yield a negative refractive index come in the form of @xmath3 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the relative permittivity and permeability of the material , respectively .",
    "materials having simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity are known as double negative materials .",
    "note , however , that these conditions are sufficient but not necessary to achieve a negative index .",
    "necessary conditions require only that @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "several classes of nim have been realized experimentally with a few standard designs emerging that yield negative indices in a wide range of frequencies .",
    "photonic crystals @xcite have been shown to exhibit a negative index in the near - ir range , but their utility as imaging devices is limited by the internal structure of the crystal , which has dimensions on the order of the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "split - ring resonators ( srr ) @xcite can exhibit negative index at telecommunication wavelengths . in general , the srr provides a negative permeability that , when combined with the negative permitivity of a metallic component , results in a negative real component of the refractive index .",
    "the operating frequencies of the srr can be shifted toward the visible rangle by miniaturization . the first class of nim to reach the visible spectrum is perhaps the simplest and in that sense the most versatile .",
    "a pair of nanowires separated by some dielectric has been shown theoretically and experimentally give a negative refractive index in the near ir and visible range @xcite .",
    "there also exist s - shaped variations on the wire - pair structure in the spirit of the srr known as s - shaped resonators @xcite .",
    "the behavior of double s - shaped resonators can be mimicked by a single pair of asymmetric parallel nanowires @xcite , which bear strong resemblence to the simple metal - dielectric - metal sandwich described above .    clearly there",
    "exist many possibilities for high quality nim , and characterizing the refractive index theoretically can aid the design of such materials , circumventing the need for expensive experimental optimizations of metamaterial geometeries .",
    "refractive index retreival methods based on scattering- or s - parameters @xcite are the most direct and robust methods for relating refractive index to theoretically and experimentally tractable parameters such as complex transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "the extraction procedures work reasonably well in most cases , but , occasionally , severe branching ambiguities muddle the procedure and introduce an element of subjectivity into the index assignments . in this paper , we suggest a simple and powerful method for automatically selecting the correct branches in the extraction procedure by invoking the concept of causality . the well - known kramers - kronig relations automatically guide the extraction procedure and in some cases allow us to predict a structure to be a nim that would otherwise be difficult to characterize .",
    "s - parameter retrieval procedures begin with the assumption that the metamaterial may be approximated by a homogeneous slab with a well - defined thickness , @xmath5 . the complex transmission and reflection coefficients are given by @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance from the center of the slab to the evaluation planes above and below the sample .",
    "the reflected and transmitted fields are normalized by the incident light , @xmath9 at the reflection evalulation plane . the refractive index for a homogeneous nim in vacuum ( or on a substrate with refractive index equal to unity ) is given by @xmath10 the sign in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : refind ] ) is uniquely determined by requiring that im(n ) be positive .",
    "however , the real portion of the inverse cosine function is prone to branching ambiguities , where seemingly valid solutions exist for all integers , @xmath11 .",
    "the s - parameter retrieval is based in the assumption that the metamaterial may be treated as a homogeneous material , and as such , the macroscopic refractive index should be independent of the thickness of the nim , d. to maximize the separation of the branches , the extraction procedure should be performed on as thin a slab as possible , and even then , one should perform more than one analysis with differing values for d. the true branches should reveal themselves in their insensitivty to the choice of d. unfortunately , metamaterial properties are very sensitive to geometric parameters , and it is virtually impossible to alter d in such a way as to maintain a constant refractive index . choosing branches becomes a more subjective process wherein one selects parameters as a continuous function of frequency @xcite .",
    "we will show that this process is still flawed , as the solution can be skewed by specious discontinuities in the refractive index as a function of frequency .",
    "the ambiguities in the extraction procedure are ultimately rooted in ( and may ultimately be circumvented by ) the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : refind ] ) is insufficient to guarantee that the obtained refractive indices are causal ; that is , do the real and imaginary components reflect the analytical properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ? the well - known kramers - kronig ( kk ) relations @xcite guarantee that knowledge of the imaginary component of the refractive index over all frequencies implies knowledge of the real component by the integration @xmath12 similarly , knowledge of the real component over all frequencies can be mapped to the imaginary component : @xmath13 regardless of the extent to which branching issues complicate the extraction procedure , the kk relationship between the real and imaginary components of the refractive index must hold at all wavelengths .",
    "the correct form of im(n ) is easy to obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : refind ] ) ; one simply selects the sign such that the imaginary component is positive .",
    "we can verify the validity of the similarly obtained real components by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : kk_real ] ) over frequencies that effectively span the range 0 to @xmath14 . in practice , very accurate values for re(n ) may be obtained by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqn : kk_real ] ) over a very wide , finite range of frequencies . the infinite - frequency limit of the refractive index , @xmath15 , is given by the extraction procedure in the limit of very small wavelength .",
    "in the limit of @xmath16 , all branches in the inverse cosine function converge and all ambiguities are removed .",
    "it should be noted that we have used kramers - kronig relations concerning @xmath17 .",
    "somewhat less convenient for our purposes , but more fundamental , kk relations exist for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of our kk relations requires that @xmath18 be analytic in the upper half of the complex plane , @xmath19 as @xmath16 , and no conductivity at @xmath20 .",
    "these conditions in relation to metamaterials were discussed by skaar @xcite . in particular , the metamaterial must be a passive medium , with no gain .",
    "however , it has also been pointed out that @xmath21 has the same analytical properties as @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately , and therefore a kk relation for @xmath21 would be appropriate in the case of gain @xcite .",
    "we have verified numerically that the computed @xmath22 and @xmath23 from our approach discussed below satisfy this other kk relation . in future work",
    ", it may be interesting to consider the use of this relation directly .",
