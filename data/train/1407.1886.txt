    "nonlinearity and complexity are common features of a large number of systems studied in modern science @xcite-@xcite . in many cases , researchers have detected the existence of power laws , for different characteristic quantities of such complex systems .",
    "these interesting contributions , at the interfaces of various disciplines , are often tied to various technical questions or are limited to the analysis of distribution functions , themselves considered to be the first to look at for characteristics of complex systems , but without conveying questions tied to self - organizations @xcite or external constraints @xcite .",
    "in particular , ranking analysis has received much attention , since zipf @xcite observed that a large number of size distributions , @xmath0 can be approximated by a simple _ scaling ( power ) law _",
    "@xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ranking parameter , with @xmath3 , ( and obviously @xmath4 ) .",
    "zipf idea has led to a flurry of log - log diagrams showing a straight line through the displayed data such that `` any '' size distribution , more generally called @xmath5 , reads @xmath6 i.e. , the so called rank - size scaling law .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath7 is considered to indicate whether the size distribution @xmath5 is close or not to some optimum ( equilibrium ) state @xcite , i.e. when @xmath8 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 can be estimated from the normalization condition .",
    "indeed , the pure power - law distribution , for a @xmath10 variable , known as the @xmath11-distribution @xcite , or discrete pareto distribution , reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability of observing the value @xmath14 , a positive integer , @xmath15 is the power - law exponent , and @xmath16 @xmath17@xmath18 is the riemann zeta function ; note that @xmath15 , in eq.([eq0 ] ) must be greater than 1 for the riemann @xmath11-function to be finite .",
    "therefore , for the discrete distribution , eq.([zipfeq ] ) , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the largest value of @xmath14 .    this might be the case in sport competition ranking , though the number of scales is obviously finite .",
    "here below , an analysis of data from a specific nonlinear complex system , i.e. the union of european football associations ( uefa ) team ranking , as a specific modern society interesting example , is discussed .",
    "the data is described and its analysis performed in sect .",
    "[ uefadata ] through simple empirical laws in order to introduce possible fits .",
    "the classical rank - size , hyperbolic , eq.([zipfeq ] ) , relationship is not found for uefa teams . on the contrary , after many data statistical tests ( not reported ) , classes emerge , best seen through the use of a 3-parameter , thus generalized , lavalette function .",
    "a top , a middle and a low class of teams appear .",
    "several remarks serve as conclusions , in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "warning : it should be obvious that the ranking of a team may change from a year to another , after some season ; see appendix .",
    "there is @xmath21 further consideration here on the time evolution of a team through the ranking .",
    "no doubt that the time dependence of the ranks should be of interest as well , but , due to likely economic conditions , beside sport ones , such a subject is left for dynamic evolution studies , including evolution modeling , outside the present aims .",
    "note , in concluding this introduction , that the literature on @xmath22 ranking is very large , in particular tied to economics questions , as in @xcite .",
    "thus , we mention a few publications where soccer and ranking from direct measures ( win , draw , loss ) have been considered :    * stefani 1997 pioneering survey of the major world sports rating systems , including soccer through fifa , 53 of them being in the uefa . ]",
    "rules , is first to be noted @xcite ; * kern and paulusma 2001 paper discussing fifa rules complexity for competition outcomes , leading to @xmath23 ranking @xcite , from where * macmillan and smith , explaining @xmath24 ranking in 2007 @xcite ; such a theme being reconsidered by * ausloos et al .",
    "@xcite comparing the fifa country ranking , based on games between national squads , to the uefa ranking , based on @xmath23 game results , and * constantinou and fenton @xcite determining the level of `` ability '' of ( five english premier league seasons ) soccer teams based on the relative discrepancies in scores between adversaries .",
    "usually , the ranking represents the overall performance over the period of 5 consecutive seasons @xcite , after averaging points obtained in various competitions , at the end of each year ( more exactly season ) , only for teams having participated in the uefa champions league and the uefa europa league .",
    "thus , e.g. the 2009/10 coefficient results from games having taken place in 2005/06 @xmath25 , 2009/10",
    ". the rules are more complicated than a `` win - draw - loss '' rating .",
    "they depend on the success at some competition level , and differ according to the competition .",
    "a uefa coefficient table is freely available and is updated regularly depending on the competition timing .",
    "here below , 5 different consecutive seasons data are examined : 2009/10 , @xmath25 , 2013/14 ( till may 2014 ) .",
    "the number of concerned teams ranges from 424 to 453 according to the season . in statistical physics terms , this is an open system , with birth and death processes .",
    "however such events mainly occur for the `` not too top '' teams .",
    "the statistical characteristics of the ranking distributions for the various years are given in table [ table0914stat ] .",
    "it can be noticed that the mean is increasing rather slowly , as do the skewness and kurtosis , indicating a widening of the distributions , and a kind of moving average effect , but @xmath26 is rather stable indicating some shuffling mainly among the top teams .",
