    "astronomers are understandably enthusiastic about the prospect of detecting jovian - type planets transiting bright ( @xmath15 ) chromospherically quiet late - type stars .",
    "a bright parent star allows highly accurate orbital parameters to be deduced from doppler rv measurements , while the transit phenomenon affords direct measurements of the planetary parameters .    indeed , the celebrated occultations of hd 209458 ( v=7.65 ) ( charbonneau et al . 2000 , henry et al .",
    "2000 ) have provided a scientific bonanza .",
    "the identification of this transit allowed detailed follow - up measurements , including direct and accurate measurements of the planet s radius ( @xmath16 [ brown et al .",
    "2001 ] ; @xmath17 [ cody & sasselov 2002 ] ) , mass ( @xmath18 ; [ mazeh et al . 2000 ] ) , and even the presence of sodium in its atmosphere ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 ) .    following the discovery of 51 peg ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , theoretical models of jovian - mass planets subject to strong irradiation were computed ( guillot et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these models predicted that short - period jovian planets with equilibrium temperatures of 13001400 k at ages of several gyr would be significantly larger than jupiter .",
    "the discovery that hd 209458b has a large radius initially seemed to be a strong confirmation of these models ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ) .    while the large observed size of hd 209458b certainly suggests that it is a gas - giant composed primarily of hydrogen , recent work by guillot & showman ( 2002 ) indicates that a serious gap exists in our understanding of irradiated giant planets .",
    "they show that standard evolutionary models can recover the observed radius of hd 209458b only if the deep atmosphere is unrealistically hot .",
    "a more nearly correct treatment of radiative heating leads to more rapid and efficient planetary contraction , and predicted radii which are 0.20.3 @xmath19 too small , that is , in the range @xmath20 at an age of 5 gyr .",
    "the results of bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , based on similar assumptions , also produce radii which are too small .    two resolutions to this problem",
    "have been suggested .",
    "bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that hd 209458b might be receiving interior tidal heating through ongoing orbital circularization , whereas guillot & showman ( 2002 ) propose that strong insolation - driven weather patterns on the planet are leading to some conversion of kinetic wind energy into thermal energy at pressures of tens of bars . at the time the work of bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) was done , the eccentricity of hd 209458 was thought to be consistent with zero , thus no obvious source of tidal heating was present .",
    "however , as we discuss below , the continued accumulation of rv measurements of hd 209458b will allow for much tighter constraints on the planetary eccentricity and the possible presence of a second planetary companion .",
    "although there are a number of studies of the evolution of giant planets ( for reviews see hubbard et al .",
    "2002 ; burrows et al . 2001 ) , at present there are no published grids of models for planets with equilibrium temperatures in the 5001000 k regime that are intermediate between jupiter ( @xmath21 k ) and hd 209458b ( @xmath22 k ) . as we discuss below",
    ", we expect that transiting planets with intermediate periods ( @xmath23 ) will soon be found .",
    "one of the major intents of this paper is to provide predictions for the radii of such planets .",
    "indeed , an accurate size and mass determination for even a single intermediate - period planet will help resolve the size discrepancy observed for hd 209458b .",
    "a planet with intermediate period will not be experiencing significant internal tidal dissipation , but would still be irradiated to an extent sufficient to produce a significant amount of kinetic heating from the mechanism suggested by guillot & showman ( 2002 ) .",
    "we therefore also wish to show that within certain limits such observations can ( 1 ) distinguish between planets with and without a solid core , and ( 2 ) show whether or not the kinetic heating mechanism is operating .",
    "one possible consequence of such a comparison could be that the kinetic heating mechanism is not effective and that therefore hd 209458b s radius can only be explained by tidal dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "if newly - discovered radii were found to be consistent with kinetic heating , constraints could be placed on the ( still not - well understood ) tidal heating mechanism .",
    "intermediate - period planets are also interesting because they can harbor dynamically stable large satellites .",
    "indeed , all satellites larger than @xmath24 orbiting a @xmath25 jovian planet are removed over 5 gyr . however , mars - mass moons can last for 5 gyr in the hill sphere of a 1 @xmath0 planet orbiting a 1 @xmath26 star in a 27 day ( 0.18 au ) orbit , whereas in a 54 day ( 0.28 au ) orbit , earth - mass moons are dynamically stable ( barnes & obrien 2002 , evonuk et al .",
    "brown et al . ( 2001 ) report that with hst , detections of satellites as small as 1 @xmath27 are feasible .",
    "therefore , the discovery of the transit of an intermediate - period planet could be followed up to search for large moons , and , additionally , planetary rings .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that a planet transits its parent star as seen from the line of sight to earth is given by , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the radii of the star and planet , respectively , @xmath32 is the orbital eccentricity , and @xmath33 is the argument of periastron referenced to the plane of the sky . in order to obtain an accurate mass for a transiting planet , one requires a good set of rv measurements so that an orbit can be fit .",
    "accurate rv measurements are best obtained for bright parent stars , so it is therefore useful to estimate the number of transiting planets that are likely to be available for accurate mass and radius determinations . if one examines the parameters of the current rv planet catalog , one finds that among the 16 known planets with periods @xmath34 , there are @xmath35 expected transits , and indeed , within this group , a transiting case ( hd 209458b ) is known .",
    "twelve of the planets with @xmath34 have firm non - detections ( including hd 68988b and hd 217107b , whose properties are discussed in more detail below ) . of the remaining three planets with @xmath34 , one , hd 76700b ( @xmath36 )",
    "is currently under surveillance , and two others , hd 162020b ( @xmath37 ) , and hd 168746 ( @xmath11 ) will be evaluated during spring 2003 .    within the aggregate of 23 known planets having periods in the range @xmath38 ,",
    "the expected number of transiting planets is @xmath39 .",
    "very few of the parent stars in this group , however , have been exhaustively monitored for transits .",
    "these stars therefore represent excellent targets for a distributed network of small telescopes .",
    "we also note that among the 60 known planets with @xmath40 , one expects @xmath41 additional transiting planets .",
    "because of the less well - determined orbits for most of these long - period planets , and because of the infrequent occultations , these stars will remain difficult targets to follow up .",
    "in addition to the current census , more planets with periods suitable for the discovery of transits will soon be emerging from the rv surveys . to see this , consider figure 1 , which plots the periods of 98 known extrasolar planets versus the julian dates on which their discoveries were announced .",
    "the magnitudes of the parent stars are color - coded to range from red ( @xmath42 ) to black ( @xmath43 ) , while the radii of the circles marking each planet are proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "this diagram shows that the pace of discovery of extrasolar planets with @xmath45 is proceeding at a steady rate , while the rate of discovery of planets with @xmath34 has begun to peak .",
    "currently , within the @xmath38 range , there are five known planets orbiting stars with @xmath46 , seven orbiting stars with @xmath47 , six orbiting stars with @xmath48 , and two planets each in the @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ranges . if we assume that every available chromospherically quiet main sequence dwarf with @xmath46 has been adequately surveyed for @xmath45 planets , and that each magnitude bin of unit width contains 1.8 times as many stars as available for bin @xmath51 , then we expect that roughly @xmath52 detectable planets with @xmath23 exist in orbit around stars with @xmath53 , indicating that more than 100 additional planets in this category can be detected using current rv techniques for bright stars .",
    "statistically , this implies that 3 intermediate - period rv - detectable transiting planets orbit bright nearby stars .",
    "application of the same argument to planets with @xmath54 indicates that 4 short - period transiting planets are to be expected in orbit around bright stars .    in summary",
    ", we can expect to obtain highly accurate radii and masses for only a limited number of planets .",
    "this collection will serve as the major observational basis for our understanding of the structure of giant planets .",
    "the ten or so transiting planets that we can expect to find will likely span two orders of magnitude in mass ( @xmath55 ) , and a wide range in temperature ( @xmath56 ) . in order to interpret this data ,",
    "it is useful to compute a grid of models spanning mass and equilibrium temperature at the age of a typical planet - bearing star ( 5 gyr ) .",
    "models for the evolution of giant planets of various masses have been computed with a descendant of the berkeley stellar evolution code ( henyey , forbes , & gould 1964 ) .",
    "this computer program has received a number of modifications and improvements to the input physics during its forty years of existence .",
    "it calculates the evolution and mass accretion rate of the gaseous envelope , under the assumption that the planet is spherical , and that the standard equations of stellar structure apply .",
    "it has been used to calculate the formation phase of planets in the solar system ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) and of extrasolar planets by bodenheimer , hubickyj , & lissauer ( 2000 ) .",
    "the physical assumptions employed in the calculations are described in those papers .",
    "energy transport occurs either by radiation or convection , according to the schwarzschild criterion for convection .",
    "energy sources include ( 1 ) gravitational contraction , ( 2 ) cooling of the interior , and ( 3 ) in some cases energy deposition in the atmosphere , at pressures in the range 1 bar to 100 bars , caused by stellar heating ( guillot & showman 2002 ) . in the outer envelope of the planet , where radiation is likely to be the energy transport mechanism ,",
    "dust grains are assumed to have settled into the interior and evaporated , so that they contribute negligibly to the opacity .",
    "the assumed absence of grains in the envelopes of low - mass objects is consistent with studies of the detailed observed spectra of t - dwarfs ( tsuji 2002 ) .",
    "pure molecular opacities in the temperature range 70 - 4000 k were obtained from r. freedman ( private communication ) for a near - solar composition . above 4000",
    "k the table from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) was used ; however for such temperatures the models are always convective , so the details of the opacity are unimportant . in convection zones , which always include most of the mass of the planet , the temperature gradient is assumed to take the adiabatic value .",
    "the equation of state of saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) was employed , slightly softened as suggested by burrows et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . at the surface ,",
    "the luminosity is composed of two components : the internal luminosity generated by the planet ( @xmath57 ) , and the energy absorbed from the stellar radiation flux and re - radiated ( ` insolation ' ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the rosseland mean photosphere are @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total luminosity , @xmath61 is the equilibrium temperature defined below in equation ( 8) , @xmath62 is the mean opacity at the photosphere , @xmath63 is the pressure at the photosphere , and @xmath64 is the surface gravity .",
    "since the details of the atmosphere , including frequency - dependent effects ( chabier & baraffe 2000 ) , are not taken into account , the radii derived by this procedure should be regarded as preliminary .    in the case of extrasolar planets",
    ", it is not known whether or not a central solid / liquid rock / ice core is present ; however its presence or absence could be an important clue to the formation mechanism .",
    "the composition , density , and mass of the core would depend on the formation and migration history of the planet . in the case of the solar system",
    "giant planets it is likely that cores exist ; however , the available constraints from observations and modeling still allow a considerable range in their properties ( wuchterl , guillot , & lissauer 2000 ) . in the case of jupiter ,",
    "the range of possible core masses is 0 to 10 m@xmath65 , and for saturn it is 515 m@xmath65 .",
    "however these planets also have heavy element abundances in excess of solar abundance ratios in their gaseous envelopes . the total heavy element abundance in jupiter is thought to be about 30 m@xmath65 , or 10% of the total mass , while in saturn it is thought to be about 25% of the total mass .",
    "the division of the heavy elements between envelope and core is uncertain mainly because of uncertainties in the saumon - chabrier - van horn equation of state . with these considerations in mind , we made calculations for each mass and temperature both with a core and without a core .",
    "the core mass , which is designed to represent approximately the total excess in heavy elements over solar abundance , is taken to be 40 m@xmath65 in the case of the more massive planets ( 0.69 m@xmath66 and above ) and 20 m@xmath65 for lower masses .",
    "two cases with a 20 m@xmath65 core for 0.69 m@xmath66 were also calculated .",
    "models without cores are assumed to have solar composition ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) . in the models with cores ,",
    "the core density is assumed to have a constant value of 5.5 g @xmath70 , except for the highest mass ( @xmath71 ) , where the high pressures in the center require a higher core density , which we take to be 10.5 g @xmath70 .",
    "the composition of the envelopes of the models with cores is assumed to be solar .",
    "for the case of 1 m@xmath66 , calculations were also made with a core density of 10.5 g @xmath70 ; in an example of a current jupiter model , marley ( 1999 ) indicates that the range of densities in the core is about 9 to 23 g @xmath70 .",
    "however , much of the heavy - element material in jupiter is in the envelope at much lower pressures . for the lower masses , a core density of 5.5 g @xmath70",
    "is thought to be reasonable ; marley s ( 1999 ) saturn model has a density of 67 g @xmath70 in much of the core .",
    "a giant planet with enhanced heavy - element abundance can have a significantly smaller radius than one of the same mass with solar abundance .",
    "the initial condition is a planet of @xmath72 at an age of a few myr .",
    "the planet is assumed to have migrated to its final orbit during the formation phase , thus the assumed equilibrium temperature is constant in time . a calibration run with @xmath73 with a core and with insolation appropriate to jupiter at 5 au ( @xmath21 k ) contracted to a final radius of @xmath74 after an evolution time of 4.5 gyr . at the final time , the temperature at 1 bar pressure in the atmosphere atmosphere was about 160 k , in good agreement with observations of jupiter .    for each value assumed for the planet mass ( 0.11 , 0.23 , 0.69 , 1.00 , and @xmath75 )",
    ", the models in table 1 illustrate how the presence of a solid core , as well as the assumed value of @xmath76 , affects the planetary radius ( given in r@xmath66 ) . in this table , as well as in table 2 ,",
    "the core densities are 5.5 g @xmath70 for all cases except @xmath75 , where it is 10.5 g @xmath70 .",
    "table 2 presents an exactly analogous sequence of models which also include an energy source term ( in addition to the direct radiative heating of the atmosphere ) , applied as described by guillot & showman ( 2002 ) .",
    "this source term deposits 1.7% of the incoming stellar flux in the regions of the planetary envelope where the pressure is tens of bars .",
    "the energy deposition fraction of 1.7% was obtained through calibration runs in which the fraction was varied until the radius of hd 209458 was reproduced . specifically , with that fraction , for the case of 0.69 m@xmath66 , without a core and with @xmath77 , a radius of 1.37 r@xmath66 was obtained at an age of 4.5 gyr . for all other models ,",
    "the same fraction of the incident stellar radiation was assumed to be converted to heat at pressure levels from the surface down to @xmath78 bar , with an exponential fall - off of heating with depth .",
    "the incident stellar radiation is of course proportional to the projected area of the planet s star - facing hemisphere ; this effect was taken into account during the contraction .",
    "the radii of these models show in many cases observably large variations as the underlying physical parameters ( i.e. presence of a core or energy deposition via kinetic heating ) are varied .",
    "it is therefore likely that the discovery of several more transiting extrasolar planets will make it clear whether giant planets have solid cores , and whether they generally have access to an interior energy source such as the kinetic heating described by guillot & showman ( 2002 ) .",
    "we note that the delineation between individual modes is especially clear for both the hotter and the lower - mass planets . for a low - mass relatively short - period planet such as hd 168746b with @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath80 k , and p = 6.4 days , the two models without kinetic heating have final radii of 0.90 and 1.07 r@xmath66 for cases with a core and without a core , respectively , and the two corresponding models with kinetic heating have radii of 1.34 and 1.53 r@xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the four possibilities should be cleanly separable observationally , as the observational uncertainly is about 0.1 r@xmath66 . in the case of a planet with 0.11 m@xmath66 ( cf .",
    "hd 49674 ) , the effect becomes even larger , with observationally separable differences among the four cases out to @xmath81 k ( about 0.4 au for a solar - type star ) . in the case with a core , this model is intermediate between a saturn - type and a neptune - type planet , with an envelope mass of 15 m@xmath65 and a core mass of 20 m@xmath65 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that for a planet as massive as 3 m@xmath66 it is not possible to observationally distinguish between these various cases , except that at very short periods with @xmath82 or 2000 k , it may be possible to determine whether or not kinetic heating is occurring . for 1",
    "m@xmath66 it is in general not possible to distinguish between planets with or without cores ; for the calculations without kinetic heating the difference is only about 5% .",
    "it is , however , possible to distinguish between planets with or without kinetic heating if the equilibrium temperature is above about 1200 k. models with 1 m@xmath66 have also been calculated with a core density of 10.5 g @xmath70 .",
    "their radii are close to 3% smaller in all cases ( with or without kinetic heating ) than in the case with a density of 5.5 g @xmath70 , making the difference in radius between a planet with and without a core marginally detectable in some cases . in the case of 0.69 m@xmath66 ,",
    "planets with or without cores are only marginally separable , while planets with or without kinetic heating are cleanly separable down to @xmath80 k. calculations were also made for 0.69 m@xmath66 with a core of 20 m@xmath65 , with and without kinetic heating and with @xmath83 k. the radii turned out to be 1.06 and 1.22 r@xmath66 , respectively , intermediate between the values for the case without a core and for the case with a core of 40 m@xmath65 .",
    "in this situation the presence of a core could not be detected , but the effect of kinetic heating could still be clearly discerned .",
    "while additional transiting planets will certainly be of immense importance in clarifying the structural theory of extrasolar giant planets , there is interesting information which can be gleaned from the current census of extrasolar planets .",
    "we now use the planet models which were described in the previous section to examine a number of interesting individual cases .      as table 1",
    "shows , a standard model for @xmath84 without a core at @xmath85 has a radius of only 1.12 @xmath19 ; the model with a core is even smaller .",
    "bodenheimer , lin & mardling ( 2001 ) suggest that internal dissipation of tidal energy arising from orbital circularization is responsible for the large observed size of hd 209458b .",
    "if hd 209458b is unperturbed by a third body , then tidal dissipation will circularize its orbit on a timescale ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the planet s mean motion , @xmath88 is the stellar mass , and @xmath89 is the tidal quality factor .",
    "@xmath89 is associated with substantial uncertainty . based on the jupiter - io interaction ,",
    "@xmath90 is estimated to lie in the range @xmath91 ( yoder & peale 1981 ) .",
    "onset of tidal circularization among main - sequence binaries suggests that the q - value for stars is of order @xmath92 ( terquem et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath89 values for extrasolar planets are likely to be strong functions of planetary mass , temperature , and composition .",
    "as more planets are found with periods , @xmath93 , the range of @xmath89 values appropriate to moderately irradiated planets of a range of masses will become better determined .",
    "the rate of internal energy dissipation is given by , @xmath94 which for hd 209458b is @xmath95 to estimate this rate for particular choices of @xmath89 , we need to estimate the orbital eccentricity for hd 209458b .    to date",
    ", the uc - keck planet search has obtained rv measurements of hd 209458 which fall in 33 distinct 2-hour time bins .",

    "radial velocity measurements taken during transit are seriously affected by asymmetric distortions in the stellar line profiles arising from the planet occulting a rotating star ( bundy & marcy 2000 , queloz et al .",

    "therefore , if the best - fit eccentricity is secure , and if hd 209458b contains no core , the observed radius can be explained by tidal dissipation if @xmath118 , well within the range derived for jupiter . the required dissipation is higher than that quoted by bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) because of changes in the equation of state and opacity since that time .",
    "also , for a model with a core , internal heating of @xmath119 is required to maintain the same radius .",
    "this amount of heating would require , for the same value of @xmath89 , an eccentricity @xmath120 , a value which appears to be incompatible with the rv data set .",

    "1992 ) periodogram of the rv residuals after the rv contribution due to our 1-planet ( e=0.033 ) fit has been subtracted .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram is optimized to detect periodicities in unevenly sampled data , and is described in detail by scargle ( 1982 ) . in our periodogram , modest peaks remain at 365 and 80 day periodicities .",
    "the 365 day periodicity is certainly an aliasing peak arising from the 1-year observing cycle .",
    "if we make the hypothesis that the 80 day peak arises from a second companion , we estimate the @xmath99 of this second planet to be @xmath124 , in order to model the @xmath125 scatter which is unaccounted for by the rms instrumental error of @xmath126 and an assumed stellar jitter of @xmath127 .",
    "this estimate for stellar jitter is based on values reported for several similarly old , chromospherically quiet g stars ( saar , butler , & marcy 1998 ) , and could be significantly larger .",
    "we have performed four self - consistent 2-planet fits to the velocities ( see laughlin & chambers 2001 ) . in the first three fits , we constrain the parameters of the hypothetical second planet `` c '' by fixing the argument of periastron @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , and assuming eccentricity values ( i ) @xmath130 , ( ii ) @xmath131 , and ( iii ) @xmath132 .",

    "it is important to stress that these fits illustrate only the existence of models that provide a consistent explanation of the stellar rv variations .",
    "they by no means constitute the detection of a second planetary companion .",
    "we next examine the dynamical consequences arising from the presence of a second planet in the hd 209458 system . for concreteness",
    ", we use our fit in which the eccentricity of the hypothetical second planet is fixed at @xmath132 .",
    "inclusion of this second planet causes the fitted eccentricity of hd 209458b to decline to @xmath139 .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have noted that the inclusion of a second planet into a rv fit generally causes the fitted eccentricity of the first planet to decline .    in order to examine the degree of eccentricity exchange between planet `` b '' and the hypothetical planet `` c '' ,",
    "we start with the osculating orbital elements reported in table 3 for the trial self - consistent 2-planet fit having @xmath132 , and integrate the system forward in time using the burlirsch - stoer method .",
    "we note that in the absence of relativistic advance of the perihelion of planet hd 209458b , the laplace - lagrange secular exchange of angular momentum ( e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) is quite strong ",
    "the eccentricity of planet `` b '' oscillates between 0.018 and 0.14 with a period of @xmath140 years .",
    "relativistic apse precession , however , detunes the secular exchange and reduces the time - averaged @xmath141 to 0.03 ( see also mardling & lin 2002 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the two planets experience an apsidal lock when relativistic apse precession is included , but this lock is not required for the secular eccentricity exchange to occur .",
    "note that while the ratio of the total angular momenta @xmath142 is not far from unity , the larger eccentricity excursions for planet `` b '' occur because its eccentricity is smaller .",
    "that is , given that the orbital angular momentum of a planet is @xmath143 and that the total angular momentum @xmath144 is conserved , the @xmath145 dependence in the above equation demands larger eccentricity variations for the planet with smaller eccentricity .",
    "as discussed above , our evolutionary models show that @xmath146 for @xmath147 produces sufficient heating in the planet to account for the observed radius in the event that the planet contains no core and @xmath148 .",
    "the rms rv measurement errors for hd 209458b are @xmath149 , and so as more rvs are obtained for this star , the presence of a second companion of the type described here should be confirmed or ruled out .",
    "the potential detectability of the perturbing companion `` c '' is aided by the requirement that its period should be less than the current @xmath150 day duration of the rv data set .",
    "hd 209458 shows a rv trend of only @xmath151 .",
    "trial calculations of secular eccentricity exchange indicate that an exterior planet producing a linear @xmath152 velocity trend is not large enough to maintain a significant time - averaged eccentricity for planet hd 209458b .",
    "hence the perturbing companion , if it exists , has a period short enough to average out a residual trend over a 4-year time frame .",
    "the hypothetical @xmath153 planets considered above easily fulfill this condition .",
    "the current keck planet search rv data set for hd 209458b contains only 33 binned rvs , which means that a significant improvement of the system characterization can be obtained over the next several years if frequent additional measurements are made .",
    "because individual high - precision rv measurements are expensive , it is therefore useful to examine how the detectability of a hypothetical hd 209458 `` c '' improves as more rv measurements are taken .    to do this",
    ", we have taken the hypothetical 2-planet system shown in fit 3 of table 3 , and integrated it forward through jd",
    "2453266 ( september 2004 ) .",
    "we then generated a simulated campaign of 120 additional rv measurements over the next 1.5 observing seasons for hd 209458 ( ra=22:03 , dec=+18:53 ) .",
    "our simulated campaign includes 11 individual rv measurements cadenced according to typical observing runs on the keck telescope and 109 rv measurements accumulated over 6 dedicated nights on a smaller instrument such as the lick observatory 3-meter telescope .",
    "this combination of intensive and sporadic monitoring is intended to improve phase coverage of both planets , while expending a reasonable amount of telescope time .",
    "we then sample the integrated reflex velocity of the star in response to the two planets at each of the 120 epochs in the simulated observing campaign .",
    "gaussian scatter consistent with instrumental error ( 4.8 m / s ) and stellar jitter ( 4.0 m / s ) is added to the sampled stellar reflex velocities .",
    "this results in a synthetic data set which includes the 30 real plus 120 simulated rv points .",
    "we then perform 1-planet and 2-planet fits to all 150 points . the best 2-planet fit results in a total rms scatter of 6.79 m / s , while the best 1-planet fit results in a scatter of 7.41 m / s , suggesting that a moderately intensive campaign on hd 209458b will result in a slow , but nevertheless feasible discrimination between the 1 and 2planet hypotheses . additional monte - carlo simulations of this type can be used to further refine the observing strategy . if the eccentricity of the hypothetical planet `` c '' is larger , as in the fourth fit of table 3",
    ", then the planet will be easier to detect , due to the comparatively larger reflex velocity of the star during the peri - astron passage .",
    "we also note that the time @xmath154 between successive transits for hd 209458b varies by @xmath155 over the course of a single 84 day period of the hypothetical companion . while the average period of hd 209458b can be determined very accurately by spanning a large number of periods ( welsh et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is difficult to obtain 1 s accuracy for the duration of a single orbit . it might be possible , however , to measure precession - induced secular changes in the period of hd 209458b arising from perturbations caused by a second companion ( see miralda - escud 2002 ) .",
    "the period range between 3 and 10 days is now populated by 16 planets covering a wide range of masses and equilibrium temperatures . equation ( 4 ) indicates that if @xmath156 , then planets with periods of order 1 week should be in the process of actively circularizing .",
    "the circularization timescale , however , depends sensitively on the planetary radius ( @xmath157 ) , and so among planets with periods of about a week there should be a wide range of non - zero eccentricities , even in the absence of companions capable of forcing eccentricity .",
    "there are two additional uncertainties .",
    "tidal dissipation within the host star can also contribute to the evolution of the planet s eccentricity , although it is smaller than that due to planetary dissipation ( dobbs - dixon et al 2003 ) .",
    "past tidal inflation instability can also lead to the circularization of planets with @xmath158 ( gu et al .",
    "this effect is not important for systems with finite eccentricity .",
    "as more planets are discovered in the @xmath159 period range , all of the parameters in equation ( 4 ) will begin to become overconstrained , eventually allowing @xmath160 and @xmath161 to be observationally determined .",
    "in order to see how the discovery of additional planets with periods of order 1 week will lead to a better determination for @xmath89 as a function of planetary mass and temperature , consider table 4 , which lists relevant planetary and stellar information for hd 68988b ( vogt et al .",
    "2002 ) , hd 168746b ( pepe et al . 2002 ) , and hd 217107 ( fischer et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this table ,",
    "stellar masses , radii and effective temperatures are taken from allende prieto & lambert ( 1999 ) .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of the planets is calculated as @xmath162 } ^{1/4 } , \\eqno(8)\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath163 is the time - averaged distance between the planet and the star for a keplerian orbit of semi - major axis @xmath29 and eccentricity @xmath32 , and @xmath164 is the bond albedo for the planet .",
    "we adopt @xmath165 when computing the values for @xmath61 listed in table 4 .",
    "the last eight rows of table 4 show our predictions for the planetary radii and circularization e - folding times .",
    "the radii are computed via linear interpolation between the relevant models of tables 1 and 2 , and are coded according to the presence or absence of a core ( c / nc ) and the presence or absence of kinetic heating ( k / nk ) .",
    "circularization times in each case are computed assuming a fiducial value @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "note that @xmath168 is linearly dependent on @xmath89 .    with these assumptions",
    ", we find that for hd 68988b and hd 217107b , the observationally well - established eccentricities of @xmath169 for both planets are consistent with computed circularization timescales that comfortably exceed the estimated stellar ages .",
    "in particular , we note that the non - zero observed eccentricity for hd 68988b is no longer in disagreement with the circularization timescale .",
    "a disagreement was noted previously by vogt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who computed a @xmath170 based on a radius estimate for hd 68988b of @xmath171 , motivated by the observed radius for hd 209458b .",
    "we also note that @xmath172 and @xmath173 erg s@xmath116 for hd 68988b and hd 217107b respectively .",
    "in contrast , the assumed kinetic energy deposition rate ( 1% of the irradiation flux ) is @xmath174erg s@xmath116 for both planets .",
    "even with a modest q - value ( @xmath175 ) , @xmath176 is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath177 so that tidal dissipation is unlikely to enlarge these planets by a noticeable amount .    for hd 168746 ,",
    "however , the situation is more interesting . because the planet mass is likely to be small , @xmath178",
    ", there is a large range in the predicted planetary radii depending on the presence of a core and/or kinetic heating , and hence the estimates for @xmath168 vary widely , from @xmath179 for a core - free model with kinetic heating , to @xmath180 for a model with a core and no kinetic heating .",
    "pepe et al . ( 2002 ) estimate that the star hd 168746 is at least several gyr old , and report an observed eccentricity of @xmath181 . using the 154 rvs",
    "posted at cds in conjunction with the pepe et al .",
    "( 2002 ) paper , we confirm that a best - fit @xmath182 is obtained for @xmath183 , but this value increases to only @xmath184 for @xmath185 , indicating that a circular orbit for hd 168746b is still tenable .",
    "improvement of the orbital elements will certainly result as further rv measurements are accumulated .    for this low - mass planet , @xmath186erg s@xmath116 .",
    "we computed two sets ( with and without a core of 20 @xmath1 ) of self - consistent models in which uniform tidal dissipation ( in accordance with an eccentricity @xmath183 ) is applied to the planetary interior , with @xmath187 , in addition to the surface irradiation ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "since the radius as a function of time is not known in advance , we iterate the solution until @xmath176 at the end of the calculation matches the computed model luminosity . for models with and without cores ,",
    "@xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively .",
    "these tidal models fall between the dissipationless and _ ad hoc _ kinetic energy dissipation models in the cases both with and without cores .",
    "although the coreless tidal dissipation model gives the same value for @xmath190 as the core - structure model with kinetic energy input , the observational determination of @xmath32 will remove the degeneracy .    finally",
    ", we remark on the recently reported planet ogle - tr-56b , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 k ( konacki et al . 2003 ) . in comparison with the results in table 1 ,",
    "the observationally measured @xmath194 is slightly larger than that determined for the irradiated planet with or without a core .",
    "but the results in table 2 indicate that kinetic heating at the rate of @xmath195 of the surface irradiative flux induces the planet , with or without a core , to have @xmath190 larger than the observed value .",
    "thus , kinetic heating , if it occurs below the surface of a short - period planet , is less efficient than assumed by guillot & showman ( 2002 ) .",
    "we also note that in order to prevent tidal dissipation from expanding @xmath190 beyond its observed value , the eccentricity of ogle - tr-56b must be less than @xmath196 , depending on its @xmath89 value .",
    "if the observed parameters are confirmed , the eccentricity damping time scale of the planet @xmath197 myr would be much shorter than the main sequence life span of the host star .",
    "our evolutionary models for giant planets indicate that the planetary radius is sensitively dependent on both the presence or absence of a core and on the amount of energy that is deposited within the interior of the planet .",
    "this dependence is strongest for hot low - mass ( i.e. @xmath198 ) planets , while being quite weak for planets with large mass ( i.e. @xmath199 ) regardless of the equilibrium surface temperature . the discovery of additional extrasolar planets which transit bright parent stars will impart a great deal of information on the structure and evolution of giant planets in general . the number of such planets , however , will be quite limited .",
    "the parent star of hd 209458b has @xmath200 , yet photometric measurements with hst are photon - limited to a cadence that resolves the critical ingress and egress periods into 80 second time bins ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , and a large number of additional rv measurements will be required in order to determine whether the eccentricity of hd 209458b is being forced by a second companion .",
    "a similar follow - up effort will be required for additional transiting planets as they are found .",
    "the number of available transiting planets with @xmath201 is severely limited by transit probabilities that are generally less than 10% .",
    "information on the interior properties of short - period planets can nonetheless be obtained by examining which of the planetary orbits have been tidally circularized .",
    "circularization times scale as the fifth power of the planetary radius . as a large aggregate of planets",
    "is built up , increasingly stringent limits can be placed on the unknown tidal quality factor @xmath202 and the planetary radii .",
    "finally , we note that the discovery of intermediate - period transiting planets is a challenging observational task .",
    "the most cost - effective way to find these transiting planets is to harness a network of small independent telescopes to obtain multiple ( i.e. 3 - 5 separate observers ) differential- photometric time - series of known planet - bearing stars during the well - defined time windows in which transits are expected to occur .",
    "we are currently pursuing this strategy using a network of amateur observers and small - college observatories .",
