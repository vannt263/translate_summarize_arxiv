    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) massless dirac fermions have been observed in graphene and on the surface of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis).@xcite recently , much attention has been attracted to the dirac semimetal which represents a new state of quantum matter , can support 3d dirac fermions with the linear dispersion in all three momentum directions .",
    "the stable dirac semimetals have been realized experimentally in two crystalline materials , na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 compounds.@xcite the stability of the 3d dirac points in these materials requires additional crystalline symmetries other than the time - reversal symmetry and inversion symmetry.@xcite dirac semimetals show many interesting physics properties , such as spin polarized double fermi arc surface states and chiral anomaly in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields.@xcite    finite size effect plays an important role in the system with size comparable to the quasiparticle wavelength . in 2dtis , the states on the opposite edges can couple with each other to open a gap in the gapless edge energy spectrum due to finite size effect.@xcite while for the thin film of 3dtis , depending on the thickness , it may become a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator or a trivial band insulator.@xcite similar properties are also proposed in dirac semimetal materials na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 , in which the quantum confinement effect can induce a periodically modulated gap at dirac node.@xcite whether a finite size gap is inverted or not is determined by the thickness of dirac semimetal thin film .",
    "thus , dirac semimetals na@xmath0bi and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 should cross over between trivial and nontrivial 2d insulators oscillatorily as a function of dirac semimetal thin film thickness.@xcite    it is well known that disorder has a major impact upon the transport properties of low - dimensional electronic systems.@xcite in 2009 , li _ et al_. reported that the on - site anderson type disorder can trigger a phase transition from topologically trivial phase to qsh phase with quantized edge conductance.@xcite this disorder - induced topological insulator was named as topological anderson insulator ( tai).@xcite this tai was quickly confirmed by the numerical simulations and born approximation analysis in which the disorder - induced topological phase transition can be understood by the renormalization of dirac mass and chemical potential.@xcite tai has been investigated in more related models , such as haldane model , kane - mele model and 3dti model.@xcite it is indicated that tai is dependent on the type of disorder , for example , tai phase is absent for the magnetic disorder and spatially correlated disorder.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate the interplay of disorder and quantum confinement in dirac semimetal thin film .",
    "it is found that the anderson disorder can induce a topological phase transition in this system .",
    "topological anderson insulating phase emerges by tuning the strength of disorder . by combining numerical simulation based on the recursive green s function and born approximation with the model parameters of dirac semimetal na@xmath0bi , we show that when the on - site disorder is introduced to the insulating phase of dirac semimetal with spin chern number @xmath2 , the tai phase with a quantized conductance plateau ( @xmath3 ) appears in a certain range of disorder strength .",
    "inspection of the nonequilibrium local current distribution further confirms that this quantized conductance plateau arises from the helical edge states induced by disorder .",
    "we start with a generic low - energy effective model derived from first principles results of dirac semimetals a@xmath0bi(a = na , k , rb ) and cd@xmath0as@xmath1.@xcite in the basis of @xmath4 , the hamiltonian of effective model can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the conduction @xmath7 state and @xmath8 are the heavy - hole @xmath9 state , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "now let us consider a thin film of dirac semimetal confined along @xmath26 direction with thickness @xmath27 .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) is similar to the bhz model hamiltonian describing the qsh system in hgte / cdte quantum wells.@xcite     ( blue solid line with red dots ) and the spin chern number @xmath31 ( green dashed line ) versus thin film thickness @xmath27 .",

    "when the thickness of this system is small ( @xmath37 ) , the spin chern number keeps zero , indicating that the system is actually a normal insulator .",
    "while if the thickness exceeds a critical value ( @xmath38 ) , the energy gap closes and reopens , and a nonzero spin chern number @xmath39 is obtained , which means that a topological phase transition from the normal insulator to the qsh state has happened . with further increasing @xmath27 , this system shows more than one kramer s pair of helical edge states , characterized by higher spin chern numbers with @xmath40 .",
    "the spin chern number is exactly equal to the number of the pair of one - way helical edge states .",
    "the odd spin chern number corresponds to the qsh phase , while the even spin chern number corresponds to the normal insulator .",
    "thus this system crosses over between trivial and nontrivial 2d insulators oscillatorily as a function of thin film thickness .",
    "the result given by the spin chern number is consistent with the previous results.@xcite    to better understand the different phase in dirac semimetal thin film tuned by finite size effect , we plot the energy band spectrum for thickness @xmath41 and @xmath42 in fig . [ fig2](a ) and ( d ) , which correspond to the qsh state and normal insulating state , respectively . for the case of @xmath42 , since all the subbands are trivial , there is no edge state on the side surfaces of dirac semimetal .",

    "the conductance plateau collapses when the disorder is strong enough .",
    "the quantized conductance plateau manifests the robustness of helical edge states to the weak disorder .",
    "such observation agrees with the previous result in the literatures . @xcite while intriguing phenomena emerge in the normal state ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "initially , the conductance is zero since there is no electronic state inside the band gap for a normal insulator . with the increasing of the disorder strength ,",
    "the conductance becomes finite and reaches to a quantized value ( @xmath3 ) , then the conductance maintains at this value for a certain range before eventually decreases .",
    "the absence of fluctuation in the quantized conductance plateau denotes that the quantized conductance is contributed by the helical edge states , indicating the topological nature of the tai phenomena .",
