    "it has been known for more than 60 years that adding polymers into turbulent wall - bounded flows can reduce the friction drag significantly ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this effect of polymer additives on mass transport has been studied extensively during the past 60 or so years . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of polymers additives on heat transport is much less studied .",
    "recently , an experimental study reported  @xcite that for turbulent rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convection of water , confined within a cylindrical cell heated below and cooled on top , adding polymers to the flow reduces the heat transport . in turbulent rb convection within a container of given shape ,",
    "the flow state is characterized by two dimensionless parameters : the rayleigh number ( ra ) and the prandtl number ( pr ) , where ra measures the size of the thermal forcing and pr is the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity of the fluid .",
    "moreover , there is an exact balance  @xcite between the heat transport and the energy and thermal dissipation rates .",
    "the energy and thermal dissipation rates can be decomposed as sums of contributions from the bulk of the flow and from the boundary layers near the top and bottom plates  @xcite .",
    "the experimental study reported  @xcite was conducted at a ra of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "at such a moderate ra , the energy and thermal dissipation rates are mostly due to the contribution from the boundary layers  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the observed reduction in heat transport is likely to be an effect of the polymers interacting with the boundary layer flow in turbulent rb convection .",
    "experimental measurements  @xcite indicated that the average velocity and temperature boundary layer profiles in turbulent rb convection at moderate ra could be described by those profiles in the steady - state prandtl - blasius boundary layer flow  @xcite above a slightly heated flat plate .",
    "motivated by these experimental observations , we study a steady - state prandtl - blasius boundary layer flow with polymers near a slightly heated plate and focussed particularly on the possible effect of the polymer additives on the heat transport .",
    "physically , we can think of this boundary layer flow as the flow near the bottom plate of the convection cell in turbulent rb convection .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ problem ]",
    ", we formulate the problem and set up the equations of motion for the system .",
    "we discuss how the set of equations can be solved numerically by an iterative scheme in section  [ cal ] . after solving the problem using such a scheme ,",
    "our results show that the effect of the polymers is equivalent to producing a space - dependent effective viscosity that first increases from the zero - shear value at the plate then decreases rapidly back to the zero - shear value far from the plate .",
    "we further show that such an effective viscosity would lead to an enhancement in the friction drag and a reduction in heat transport .",
    "we shall present and discuss our results in section  [ result ] .",
    "finally , we shall summarize and conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "for the prandtl - blasius boundary layer flow above a large flat plate , the velocity equation is : @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the direction along the plate , @xmath3 denotes the direction away from the plate , and @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath6 vanish at the plate and @xmath5 merges with the uniform mainstream velocity @xmath7 far away from the plate .",
    "the crucial point about eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) is that the viscous term is balanced against the nonlinear advection term and that the flow changes more rapidly away from the plate than along the plate such that @xmath8 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied for flows with large reynolds number .    introducing the variable @xmath9 and the stream function @xmath10 such that @xmath11 we obtain the famous blasius equation  @xcite @xmath12 showing that the velocity profile is self - similar in the dimensionless variable @xmath13 at different position @xmath2 along the plate . here",
    "@xmath14 denotes @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath16 as @xmath17 when it is far away from the plate .",
    "the plate is slightly heated at a temperature @xmath18 above the ambient temperature @xmath19 far away from the plate .",
    "writing the temperature field as @xmath20 [ relating to turbulent rb convection , @xmath19 can be taken as the temperature at the center of the cell and thus the total temperature difference across the cell is @xmath21 .",
    "then @xmath22 satisfies the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the thermal diffusivity of the fluid , and the boundary conditions are : @xmath26    we want to investigate the effect of polymers on heat transport in this laminar prandtl - blasius flow .",
    "the polymers produces an additional stress in the momentum equation of the fluid .",
    "this polymer stress @xmath27 depends on the amount of stretching of the polymers and is thus a function of the dimensionless conformation tensor @xmath28 of the polymers .",
    "let the vector @xmath29 denote the polymer end - to - end distance and @xmath30 be the polymer radius in the unstretched regime , then @xmath28 represents the average over many ( @xmath31 ) polymers in a small region around the point @xmath32 of the product @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 . in the simplest oldroyd - b model of polymers",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the polymer contribution to the viscosity of the solution at zero shear and @xmath37 is the relaxation time of the polymers .",
    "thus in the presence of polymers , the equation of motion for the velocity field is modified by an additional stress that depends on @xmath28 . by employing the same ideas leading to the blasius equation [ eq .  ( [ pb ] ) ] we have @xmath38 \\ ] ]",
    "it has been shown that the relaxation time of the polymers can be significantly increased by the stretching of the polymers  @xcite . to model this effect ,",
    "we let @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the bare zimm relaxation time , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is a parameter . when there is no stretching , @xmath43 and @xmath37 reduces back to @xmath40 . when there is stretching , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in the presence of polymers ,",
    "the transformation using @xmath13 does not lead to a similarity solution in general in that explicit appearance of @xmath2 remains in the equation for @xmath46 .",
    "this is known in the literature .",
    "similarity solution has been obtained in some special cases with certain velocity or temperature boundary conditions  @xcite that might not have direct physical relevance . here to circumvent this difficulty , we recall that the prandtl - blasius flow is meant to be applicable when @xmath2 is large ( such that @xmath8 ) . thus we make the following approximations : @xmath47 by putting @xmath48 , the length of the ( long ) plate , and replacing @xmath4 in @xmath13 [ eq .",
