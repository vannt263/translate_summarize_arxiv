    "the many - body effects of electron  hole systems in semiconductors generated by the intense laser field have long been attractive subjects @xcite .",
    "one of the most outstanding characteristics of the system is that the electron - hole density and the macroscopic quantum state can easily be controlled by changing the frequency and the intensity of excitation light .",
    "recent developments in the experimental techniques make it possible to observe the remarkable phenomena suggesting the optically induced macroscopic quantum states . in particular , the anomalous exciton transport observed in cu@xmath0o ( ref .  ) and bii@xmath1 ( ref .  ) are the typical examples of them .",
    "these phenomena become more significant with increasing the electron - hole densities , and are in a marked contrast to the simple ballistic exciton propagation or the conventional diffusive exciton transport .    in order to understand the nature of the macroscopic quantum state of electron - hole systems , conventional approaches based either on the weak interacting boson model @xcite or on the bcs - like mean - field theory @xcite are inappropriate .",
    "this is because the mean interparticle distance in the highly photoexcited system is often of the same order as the radius of the bound electron - hole pairs , and the system is in the intermediate state between the excitonic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and the electron - hole bcs state .",
    "the nature of the system is characterized by two kinds of order : the @xmath2he - like order associated with the center - of mass motion of electron - hole pairs and the bcs - like order associated with the electron - hole pair formation . in order to investigate the physical properties of the system",
    ", we have to incorporate the state - filling effect , which reflects the pauli principle , and the center - of - mass motion of electron - hole pairs on the same footing .    in our previous work@xcite",
    ", we have presented a theory of luminescence spectra for electron - hole systems in highly excited semiconductors ; this theory gives the correct description of the luminescence spectra in the crossover regime between the low - density excitonic bec states and the high - density electron - hole bcs states .",
    "the analysis is based on the generalized random - phase approximation @xcite combined with the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite .",
    "this approach enables us to incorporate the strong electron - hole pair correlation and the quantum fluctuation effect associated with the center - of - mass motion of electron - hole pairs .",
    "we have shown that the crossover from the excitonic bec state to the electron - hole bcs state manifests itself in the luminescence spectra .",
    "in particular , it is found that the broad emission band , arising from the pair recombination in the electron - hole bcs state , splits into the p and p@xmath3 emission bands @xcite with decreasing the electron - hole density .",
    "these results are closely related to the recent noteworthy experiment for zno , in which the room temperature ultraviolet laser emission is observed @xcite .    the purpose of the present work is to clarify the properties of the high - density electron - hole systems subject to the intense light by analyzing the pump - probe spectrum . to our knowledge ,",

    ", they found that the electron - hole pair correlations are considerably enhanced by the pump - light intensity ( `` light enhanced excitons '' ) . their calculated spectra exhibit the transparent region between the stimulated emission and the absorption components , which is the manifestation of the bcs - like gap formation . whereas their theory takes into account the pair correlation in a self - consistent manner",
    ", they neglected the screening effct of the coulomb interaction and the multiple coulomb interaction between electron - hole pairs . as a result",
    ", the excitonic sharp spectral components do not reproduce in the low electron - hole densities .",
    "the discussion was further extended to take into account the screening effect of the coulomb interaction and the finite temperature effect by iida _",
    "@xcite they considered the screening effect by the quasi - static rpa due to haug and schmitt - rink @xcite , and found that the bistable behavior arises from the band - gap renormalization . however , their analysis is based on the simple bcs - like mean field theory , so it can not properly describe the excitonic structure in the low particle densities .    in the present article",
    ", we give a unified theory of the pump - probe spectra for highly excited semiconductors , which can be applied throughout the whole density range including the high - density electron - hole bcs state and the low - density excitonic bec states .",
    "we consistently solve the combined equations of the bcs - like gap equation and the bs equation for retarded electron - hole pair green function , which first enables us to consider the state - filling effect , the band - gap renormalization , and the weak / strong pair correlation in a unified manner .",
    "this analysis is closely related to that in ref .  , where the absorption - gain spectra for condensed exciton systems are calculated for various electron - hole densities and temperatures by properly taking into account the ladder diagram for vertex function . in the present article",
    ", we calculate the pump - probe spectra for various excitation conditions and systematically analyze the dependence of the spectra on the pump - light intensity and on the pump - light frequency .    as a result",
    ", we find that the electron - hole bcs state is noticeably enhanced by the intense pump - light ; this result strongly suggests that the macroscopic quantum state can be observed under the strong photoexcitations .",
    "moreover , in the high - density state generated by the small off - resonant excitation , the calculated spectrum shows a pair of sharp peaked structures at the edge of the broad absorption and stimulated emission bands .",
    "in contrast to this , we find a series of sharp exciton lines in the low density regime generated by the large off - resonant excitation . in the intermediate density generated by the strong photoexcitation ,",
    "the calculated spectra considerably deviate from results obtained by the bcs - like mean - field analysis and those by the simple bs equation without pair correlation .",
    "in particular , we find the sharp spectral components originating from the excitation of the collective phase fluctuation mode of electron - hole bcs state ( similar to the anderson mode in superconductivity ) , which change to the exciton series with decreasing carrier density .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this result strongly suggests that the macroscopic quantum phenomena , such as excitonic superfluidity , can be observed under the strong photoexcitation .    with increasing the pump - light intensity , we find that those new sharp emission and absorption lines ( @xmath149- and @xmath150-lines ) split from the broad emission and absorption components , respectively .",
    "these new lines originate from the optical transition accompanied by the collective phase fluctuation mode in the electron - hole bcs state , which corresponds to the anderson mode in superconductivity @xcite .",
    "finally , we analyze the dependence of the calculated spectra on the pump - light frequency under the strong photoexcitation , and show that the collective phase fluctuation mode continuously changes to the exciton mode as the pump - light frequency decreases .",

    "<S> we present a unified theory for pump - probe spectra in highly excited semiconductors , which is applicable throughout the whole density regime including the high - density electron - hole bcs state and the low - density excitonic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is based on the bcs - like pairing theory combined with the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation , which first enables us to incorporate the state - filling effect , the band - gap renormalization and the strong / weak electron - hole pair correlations in a unified manner . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the electron - hole bcs state is distinctly stabilized by the intense pump - light , and this result strongly suggests that the macroscopic quantum state can be observed under the strong photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectra considerably deviate from results given by the bcs - like mean field theory and the simple bs equation without electron - hole pair correlation especially in the intermediate density states between the electron - hole bcs state and the excitonic bec state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find the sharp stimulated emission and absorption lines which originate from the optical transition accompanied by the collective phase fluctuation mode in the electron - hole bcs state . from the pump - probe spectral viewpoint , we show that this fluctuation mode changes to the exciton mode with decreasing carrier density . </S>"
