    "very large multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) or `` massive mimo '' systems @xcite are widely considered as a promising technology for future cellular networks . given perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the base station ( bs ) ,",
    "the array gain has been shown to grow unboundedly with the number of antennas at the bs so that both multiuser interference and thermal noise can be eliminated @xcite . however , if the csi is to be estimated using pilot signals , then the interference rejection capability is limited , even if the number of bs antennas is infinite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ pilot contamination _ @xcite .",
    "several promising approaches have recently emerged to mitigate pilot contamination @xcite .",
    "the schemes in @xcite exploit a specific structure of the channels in the spatial domain while @xcite propose a singular value decomposition ( svd ) based blind channel estimation scheme which projects the received signals onto an ( almost ) interference - free subspace to overcome pilot contamination .",
    "recently , however , in @xcite a the data - aided scheme , which jointly estimates the channels and data , was shown to be more effective then the schemes in @xcite .",
    "hence , it is of great interest to study the best possible performance of massive mimo systems employing joint channel - and - data ( jcd ) estimation .    to address this issue , unlike other jcd estimation schemes based on suboptimal criteria @xcite",
    ", we use bayes - optimal inference for jcd estimation as this approach provides the minimal mean - square - error ( mse ) with respect to ( w.r.t . ) the channels and the payload data .",
    "however , an implementation of the bayes - optimal jcd estimator appears extremely challenging not to mention analysing the resulting performance . in this paper , using the replica method from statistical physics , we are able to provide analytical results for the mses w.r.t .  the channels and the payload data for the bayes - optimal jcd estimator .",
    "the quest for a practical implementation of the estimator is left for future study .",
    "nevertheless , the computed mse constitutes a useful lower bound for any suboptimal estimation scheme .",
    "the mathematical framework we use herein is similar to that for solving the matrix factorization problem in @xcite but the adopted tools and derivations are adapted to the massive mimo context .",
    "several key observations are made from the analysis :    1 .   with the bayes - optimal estimator , data can be estimated reliably even with negligible pilot information and the interference from adjacent cells can be separated from the received signals without pilot information .",
    "2 .   the mses w.r.t .",
    "the data symbols and the channels decrease with the number of receive antennas @xmath0 and the number of data symbols @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in addition , residual interference terms tend to zero as @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   since @xmath1 is limited by the channel coherence time , a non - zero mse w.r.t .",
    "the channel matrix remains as @xmath3 .",
    "we consider an uplink wireless communication system with @xmath4 cells , where each cell contains a bs and there are @xmath5 user equipments ( ues ) in cell @xmath6 .",
    "each bs has @xmath0 antennas and each ue has one antenna .",
    "we assume that the channel is constant for some discrete time interval @xmath1 ( in symbols ) .",
    "for ease of exposition , we let the first cell be the cell of interest .",
    "the transmit symbols in the @xmath6th cell can be represented by matrix @xmath7 , and the corresponding channel vector between the ues in the @xmath6th cell and the target bs is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the received signals within one block of @xmath1 symbols at the target bs can be written in matrix form as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the temporally and spatially white gaussian noise with zero mean and element - wise variance @xmath11 . also , in ( [ eq : sys ] ) , we have defined @xmath12^{\\dag } \\in { { \\mathbb c}}^{k \\times t}$ ] and @xmath13 \\in { { \\mathbb c}}^{n \\times k}$ ] with @xmath14 . here",
    ", @xmath15 denotes the hermitian conjugate operation .",
    "since @xmath16 is not known to the receiver , a pilot - aided transmission is adopted .",
    "in particular , within one block of @xmath1 symbols , all ues in the @xmath4 cells simultaneously transmit _ different _ pilot sequences of length @xmath17 symbols for channel estimation , and the remaining @xmath18 symbols are used for data transmission .",
    "the training and data phases , referred to as @xmath19-phase and @xmath20-phase , respectively , are equivalent to partitioning @xmath21 as @xmath22 $ ] with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "random variables @xmath31 generated from a probability distribution @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the transmit powers during @xmath19-phase and @xmath20-phase are denoted by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "we assume that neither the ues nor the bs have csi . only the statistical properties of the channel and the transmit symbols as well as",
    "the pilot symbols are assumed known at the target bs .",
    "the objective of the bs receiver is to estimate both @xmath46 and @xmath47 from @xmath25 given @xmath48 .",

    "similarly , the bayes - optimal estimate of @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , the objective of the bayes - optimal estimator is to approximate the received signal matrix @xmath25 by a rank @xmath67 product @xmath68 , where @xmath16 is a tall matrix and @xmath52 is a wide matrix with the constraint on its upper left ( corner ) submatrix being @xmath48 .",
    "defining @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70^{\\dag } $ ] , we can rewrite ( [ eq : sys ] ) as @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "since the pilot information of the inter - cell interference is not available , it is only possible for the estimator to obtain @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is any nonsingular matrix .",
    "fortunately , this ambiguity does not change @xmath77 .",
    "thus , with the bayes - optimal estimator , @xmath78 can be separated from @xmath25 without pilot information .",
    "on the other hand , the pilot information @xmath48 can be used to eliminate the ambiguity regarding @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "_ remark 1 : _ the bayes - optimal estimator is closely related to the principle component analysis ( pca )",
    ". however , the bayes - optimal estimator can exploit additional structural information ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) about the principal eigenvectors . in this context , let us investigate the relation between the bayes - optimal estimator and the svd - based blind channel estimation scheme @xcite which is also closely related to pca . in the svd - based scheme ,",
    "the interfering signal @xmath78 is mitigated by projecting @xmath25 onto an ( almost ) interference - free subspace , obtained from the svd of @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath0 is very large and there is a certain power margin between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the first @xmath81 columns of the left singular vectors of @xmath25 are highly correlated with @xmath46 and also almost orthogonal to @xmath82 . however ,",
    "the pilot information @xmath48 is not exploited by the svd - based scheme at this stage .",
    "hence , a power margin between @xmath79 and @xmath83 is needed to separate the signal subspace from the interference subspace .",
    "in contrast , the bayes - optimal estimator does not have such limitation as it incorporates the knowledge of @xmath48 .    in this paper ,",

    "although an analytical expression for the mse for the scalar channel is available , the task of developing the corresponding result for the massive mimo channel ( [ eq : sys ] ) appears challenging .",

    "@xmath16 under the bayes - optimal approach ( i.e. , the mmse estimates ) can be obtained from proposition [ pro_mse ] .",
    "in fact , the analysis is the same as that in example 1 but the roles of @xmath16 and @xmath134 are exchanged .",
    "specifically , in the @xmath19-phase , i.e. , @xmath137 , the pilot matrix @xmath134 is known .",

    "in addition , we have exploited the fact that each entry of @xmath16 is drawn from the complex gaussian distribution .",

    "note that negligible pilot information does not imply that no pilot symbols are needed . as mentioned in section ii - b , pilot information ( though almost negligible )",
