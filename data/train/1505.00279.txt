    "tensor network ( tn ) techniques have recently revealed their potential to study lattice gauge theories ( lgt ) .",
    "numerical studies have demonstrated that matrix product states ( mps ) can accurately describe ground state and low excited levels of the schwinger model @xcite and of related quantum link models @xcite , and tensor renormalization group methods have been used to evaluate the path integral @xcite . more generally , a framework has been proposed to construct gauge invariant tn states in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "the tn ansatz can also be used to describe thermal equilibrium states .",
    "non - zero temperature studies have played a major role in lattice qcd computations , establishing a crossover behavior of qcd in the early universe @xcite .",
    "such calculations will be very important in the future for understanding qcd matter , see @xcite .",
    "different from most lgt calculations , tensor network methods work in the hamiltonian formalism . in this approach , it is in principle possible to follow the complete thermal evolution of the system .",
    "thus , employing hamiltonian calculations could allow us to map out the temperature dependence of many physical quantities over a much broader temperature regime and in a more precise way than conventional markov chain monte carlo methods .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the matrix product operator ( mpo ) ansatz can accurately describe the thermal equilibrium states of the schwinger model . to this end",
    ", we investigate the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate in the continuum limit for the massless case , for which analytical results were provided in @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with the analytical prediction at all ( dimensionless ) inverse temperatures @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "our lattice calculation using mpo requires a series of consecutive extrapolations .",
    "we describe how to carry out these steps and demonstrate that all systematic errors inherent to the method can be controlled and systematically improved .",
    "thus , the procedure yields reliable continuum values and is applicable also when the exact value is completely unknown .",
    "we use gauss law to integrate out the gauge degrees of freedom and apply tn states to describe the fermionic degrees of freedom in the exact physical subspace , as in @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that this approach , initially presented in @xcite , is also suitable for thermal states .",
    "alternatively , one could include both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom and impose gauge symmetry on the tensors , as in @xcite , but in that case the gauge degrees of freedom need to be truncated , which introduces an additional extrapolation in the procedure , which also has to be taken into account in the systematic errors .",
    "the schwinger model @xcite or qed in @xmath1 dimensions , is frequently used as a testbench for lattice calculations . in order to apply tn methods , we work in the hamiltonian formalism ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which implies we have to impose gauss law as a constraint on physical states . the kogut - susskind hamiltonian @xcite can be mapped to a spin system by a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite . using gauss law ,",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom can be eliminated @xcite , since the electric flux on a link is completely determined by the spin content and the background field , so that the model can be written : @xmath2+\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^{n-1 } \\left [ 1 + ( -1)^n \\sigma_n^z \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{n=0}^{n-2 } \\left [ \\ell + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=0}^n ( ( -1)^k+\\sigma_k^{z})\\right ] ^2 , \\label{eq : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the boundary electric field ( on the leftmost link ) , which can describe the background field , and the parameters of the model are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , in terms of the lattice spacing , @xmath6 , the fermion mass , @xmath7 , and the coupling , @xmath8 .",
    "it is then possible to use a basis @xmath9 to describe the physical space . for finite systems ,",
    "the value of @xmath3 is conserved . in the following",
    ", we will consider the case @xmath10 and omit it from the basis .",
    "we focus on the temperature dependence of the chiral condensate , @xmath11 , which is the order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking , and which in terms of spin operators reads @xmath12 .",
    "an mps for a system of @xmath13 sites with internal dimension @xmath14 and individual basis @xmath15 is a state of the form @xmath16 where each @xmath17 is a @xmath18-dimensional matrix , and the bond dimension , @xmath18 , determines the number of free parameters in the ansatz @xcite .",
    "mps are known to provide good approximations to ground states of local hamiltonians in the gapped phase @xcite and have also been successfully used for more general situations @xcite .",
    "the analogous ansatz in the space of operators @xcite is called matrix product operators ( mpo ) , and can be used to efficiently approximate thermal states of local hamiltonians @xcite .    to find an mpo approximation to the gibbs state , @xmath19 ,",
    "a suzuki - trotter decomposition is applied to the exponential , with the hamiltonian split into several terms whose exponentials are easily written or approximated as mpo . in the case of hamiltonian , it is convenient to split @xmath20 , where @xmath21 contains the @xmath22 terms for even ( odd ) @xmath23 , and @xmath24 contains the mass terms and the long range @xmath25 interactions .",
    "the exponentials of @xmath21 can be easily written as exact mpo @xcite . for @xmath24 , instead , the exponential can only be approximated . adopting a 2nd - order trotter expansion and , for @xmath24 , a 1st - order taylor expansion",
    ", we can write : ( ) ^m , [ eq : e^deltah ] where @xmath26 is the step width , and the final error for fixed @xmath27 will be @xmath28 , dominated by the taylor expansion .    starting from the identity operator , which corresponds to infinite temperature , @xmath29 , we apply successive euclidean evolution steps . after each of them",
    "a truncation is carried out to find an mpo approximation to the result .",
    "to this end , using a choi isomorphism , the mpo is mapped to an mps with local physical dimension @xmath30 , and an alternating least squares procedure is applied to minimize the euclidean distance between the vectorized mpo for the new and evolved states . since the truncation does not preserve the positivity of the whole state , it is more convenient to compute @xmath31 , where the trotter expansion explained above is used for each factor .",
    "to compute the chiral condensate in the infinite volume and continuum limits , we approximate the thermal state at each @xmath32 $ ] over a range of values of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "for each value , we consider various system sizes , with @xmath34 $ ] to ensure consistent physical volumes , and for each of them , different step widths , @xmath35 , and bond dimensions . we thus need to control effects of successively extrapolating in @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath13 and @xmath36 .    the limited bond dimension , @xmath18 , used for each fixed set of values ( @xmath36 , @xmath13 , @xmath35 ) induces a systematic truncation error . the mps family being complete , the results converge to the exact value for the given problem in the limit of very large @xmath18 ( of the order of the dimension of the operator space ) @xcite . from our finite @xmath18 results ,",
    "we estimate the final value of @xmath37 as the one obtained for the largest achieved bond dimension , @xmath38 , and the error as the difference between this value and the one obtained from @xmath39 , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : danddelta ] .",
    "a second source of systematic error is the finite step width , @xmath35 .",
    "although we use a second order suzuki - trotter expansion , the taylor approximation in induces linear corrections , @xmath28 .",
    "we can thus extrapolate linearly to obtain the value as @xmath40 , as illustrated by the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : danddelta ] for selected examples .",
    "furthermore , the taylor approximation requires that the value of @xmath35 employed in the calculation is below a certain threshold , to ensure convergence of the expansion .",
    "we find that values @xmath41-@xmath42 are sufficiently small for the considered values of @xmath36 and @xmath13 .",
    "the previous steps yield a result for each pair ( @xmath36 , @xmath13 ) . as in @xcite",
    ", we then find the thermodynamic limit by fitting the results to a linear function in @xmath43 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nandx ] shows how accurately this extrapolation fits our results for the considered values of @xmath36 .    from the infinite volume results for each lattice spacing at fixed @xmath44",
    ", we can perform the continuum extrapolation . as we showed in @xcite ,",
    "the condensate exhibits logarithmic corrections @xmath45 .",
    "hence we try two fitting functions , which additionally include linear or linear and quadratic corrections in @xmath6 , @xmath46 to include the uncertainty from the choice of the functional form of the fitting ansatz , we finally take as central value the result from the fit to @xmath47 , and as systematic error the difference between both . fig .",
    "[ fig : x ] demonstrates these fits for two very different temperatures , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and shows that quadratic corrections will only be significant at lower temperatures .",
    "higher order corrections do not provide any significant improvement for the fitting range @xmath33 $ ] .    after performing for each value of @xmath44 all the steps described above ,",
    "we obtain for the chiral condensate the temperature dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] . comparing to the analytical result in @xcite",
    ", we find excellent agreement for all @xmath50 .",
    "although the central values lie very close to the exact results , the errors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final ] seem relatively large because they include the propagated errors from the extrapolations in @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath13 and @xmath36 , as well as the systematic error from the form of the fitting ansatz for the continuum extrapolation .",
    "our approach makes it possible to fully control all sources of uncertainties .",
    "this rigorous account of errors is crucial to ensure that the technique can be used in a general situation , for which no analytical results are available .",
    "different kinds of errors contribute distinctly at different temperatures . for small @xmath44 , cut - off effects are enhanced , and systematic errors from the choice of the fitting ansatz can be an order of magnitude larger than other errors . lowering the temperature ,",
    "the effect becomes smaller , while other errors grow , in particular the propagated error from the @xmath51 extrapolation .",
    "interestingly , at intermediate values , @xmath52 , the slope of the @xmath53 extrapolations changes sign ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nandx ] ) .",
    "moreover , for this region of temperatures , the continuum limit extrapolations from @xmath47 and @xmath54 are very close . for larger @xmath44 ,",
    "all errors grow , but the increase is faster for @xmath18 and @xmath35 extrapolations so that at the end of our @xmath44 range they are an order of magnitude larger than the systematic error from the choice of the fitting ansatz .",
    "the approach is systematically improvable , because it is clear how to reduce each uncertainty . for the present analysis",
    ", the relatively most important error comes from the extrapolation in @xmath18 .",
    "we chose a rather conservative criterion to estimate this error and it is natural to expect that much more accurate results can be obtained by checking the convergence in bond dimension with larger values of @xmath18 .",
    "the cost of the computation scales with @xmath55 , which makes the scan over a rather broad range of @xmath18 feasible .",
    "it is nevertheless remarkable that the very accurate results presented here were obtained with a relatively small @xmath56 .",
    "this shows how adequate the mpo ansatz is for thermal states in this gauge theory .    for the region of",
    "very small @xmath57 , we find a significant deviation from the analytical results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : final ] ) , although the individual points at finite @xmath36 are accurate enough , because much smaller lattice spacings are required in order to correctly capture the asymptotic behavior . using the procedure described above , it is possible to reach larger values of @xmath36 , by incurring a higher computational cost , since the required system size grows as @xmath58 to maintain a consistent physical volume , and correspondingly the threshold @xmath35 that ensures convergence decreases .    using an alternative approximation for the exponential of @xmath24 that avoids the taylor expansion , it is however possible to explore the region of larger @xmath36 at a lower computational cost .",
    "indeed , @xmath59 can be written exactly as an mpo of bond dimension @xmath60 . for systems of several hundreds of sites",
    "this is unpractical , but this exponential can be approximated by projecting out those spin configurations that correspond to an electric flux larger than a certain cutoff , @xmath61 , on any of the links .",
    "this results in an mpo with bond dimension @xmath62 .",
    "notice that this truncation is equivalent to limiting the maximum occupation number for the bosonic degrees of freedom , as done in @xcite for pure states .",
    "however , the latter results in twice as large system sizes , since bosonic degrees of freedom are kept explicitly , and , in principle , in local dimensions that scale as @xmath63 for the additional sites in the mpo .     although the cost of applying the mpo for the projected exponential is higher than that of the taylor approximation , the step width error is now @xmath64 , determined by the second order trotter expansion , and there is no threshold value for @xmath35 , which allows us to reach the same @xmath44 with fewer steps . to explore the small @xmath44 region",
    ", we study the range @xmath65 $ ] . for each value of @xmath36",
    ", we compute different system sizes , step widths and @xmath61 values , and for each of them bond dimensions up to @xmath66 .",
    "as described above , we successively extrapolate @xmath67 ( as before ) , @xmath68 ( linear in @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] ( left ) . to account for the additional systematic error due to the cutoff parameter",
    ", we can also extrapolate in @xmath61 .",
    "however , comparing the results for @xmath71 $ ] , we observe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] ) that the effect is very small , and results for @xmath72 are compatible within our numerical precision ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] right ) , so here we present the results for @xmath73 and leave the detailed analysis of the cutoff effects to a more technical work  @xcite .",
    "this relatively small @xmath61 allows us to study the lattice effects for the smallest @xmath44 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : truncation ] , @xmath74 requires @xmath75 or larger to obtain an accurate continuum extrapolation .",
    "we observe that higher order corrections are present and adopt as central value the result of the fit @xmath76 , we use @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , @xmath77 , and for larger @xmath44 , @xmath79 .",
    "] and we estimate the error from using different fitting ranges . notice that to properly deal with the uncertainty due to the fit , we could run a statistical analysis as was done in  @xcite , but the simple estimate used here allows us to appreciate the relevance of reaching large @xmath36 values .",

    "we can indeed write @xmath24 as a sum of mutually commuting _ local _ terms , @xmath99 , where , for @xmath100 , h_n= + l_n^2 , and @xmath101 $ ] , @xmath102 being the electric flux on each link .",
    "the exponential of @xmath24 is diagonal in the @xmath103 spin basis , and its value on a basis vector can be written as a product of the exponentials of each of these terms for the corresponding state . since the value of @xmath102 , by virtue of gauss law , is completely determined by the spin content on sites @xmath104 , the factor corresponding to a given link can be determined from the total magnetization , @xmath105 , to the left of the corresponding site .",

    "such exact expression produces an mpo with bond dimension @xmath60 , which is not practical for the long chains involved in our study .",
    "thus , it is convenient to truncate the mpo by allowing @xmath102 , i.e. the virtual index , to assume only bounded values @xmath110 , so that the maximum bond dimension is @xmath111 .",
    "this corresponds to a truncation of the physical space to only those spin configurations for which all links have small enough electric flux , since the rest will be projected out when multiplying by the truncated exponential .",
    "another , more economical approximation to the exponential of @xmath24 can be achieved by a 1st - order taylor expansion , which can be written as an mpo with bond dimension @xmath112 . in this approach , the whole physical space is kept , so that no extrapolation in the @xmath61 parameter is required . in our calculation , we use both approaches .",
