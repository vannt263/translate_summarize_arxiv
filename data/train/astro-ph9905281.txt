    "body simulations have become the basic tool to study the non  linear stages of structure formation and evolution in the universe . in the least few years",
    ", the use of parallel computers has allowed simulations with an increasingly wide dynamical range and it is now possible to simulate boxes , with side up to hundreds mpc s , with distance and mass resolutions well below the galaxy cluster scale .    in this paper",
    "we shall report the results of three n  body simulations , in a box of side 360@xmath15mpc ( @xmath18 is the hubble parameters in units of 100 km@xmath19 ) , aimed to study the properties of galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , we shall concentrate on mixed models , which , up to now , were sometimes disregarded in large parallel simulations .",
    "two of the models tested are therefore mixed models , both with 2 massive neutrino ( @xmath4 ) species ; @xmath4 masses are @xmath20ev and 1.63@xmath21ev , to yield @xmath0 and 0.14 , respectively .",
    "( more details on the models are given below ; see , in particular , table i. ) models were selected , first of all , to approach observational data . in this work , however , we wish to quantify a peculiar behaviour of the cluster mass function , that we expect to occur for mixed models . within this context , the third model , a tilted cdm , was mostly selected for the sake of comparison .    clusters of galaxies are the largest bound systems in the universe and are also fairly rare objects . they have been systematically studied in the recent years , using both optical and x  ray data . in principle , this allows to use them to provide stringent constraints to cosmological models .",
    "the behaviour of their mass function , in particular , is a critical test .",
    "mass function data are given and/or discussed in several recent papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "for any cosmological model , the press @xmath22 schechter ( ps ) approach provides a semi  analytical estimate of such mass function and model simulations already showed a basic agreement with such estimates .",
    "some discrepancies were however outlined at the low and high mass ends , which will be also confirmed by our analysis .",
    "there is however a well defined point that we wish to explore in this work .",
    "we shall show that the presence of a hot component may substantially widen the gap between expected and observable mass functions .",
    "the qualitative reasons of this effect can be explained soon , but the extent and the mass dependence of the gap can only be numerically explored .",
    "as is known , fluctuations in the different components of mixed models evolve differently . on the scales where hot fluctuations were initially erased ,",
    "@xmath4 s can be trapped again later on , as they become slower , by fluctuations which survived in cdm ( and baryons ) .",
    "eventually , in most reasonable models , at @xmath23 , the transfer functions of the three massive components are again almost equal . at the non  linear level , instead , @xmath4 s can be distributed differently from cdm and baryons , even at @xmath23 .",
    "several simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) showed their final distribution , which follows the shape of non  linear structures , but with a tendency to stay away from structure knots , rather inhabiting peripheral regions .",
    "such behaviour can be more or less pronounced , according to the scale considered .    in the real world , baryons are the main mass tracer .",
    "galaxies emit because of their presence and diffuse gas emits radiation because of the electrons accompanying them .",
    "locating baryons in a simulation with no hydrodynamics may be hard .",
    "e.g. , in a recent work , valdarnini , ghizzardi @xmath22 bonometto ( 1999 ) have shown that using cdm instead of baryons , to study the global cluster structure , may be misleading and surely changes the scores of various cosmological models , when compared with x  ray data .",
    "the question exists also for simulations involving no hot component , but the presence of a hot component might complicate the answer .    in principle",
    ", however , the outcome would be simple .",
    "when initial conditions for the simulation are set at @xmath24 , we use separate transfer functions for hdm , cdm and baryons . the latter two components , however , have almost identical transfer functions , as baryon infall in potential wells , set by cdm at the end of recombination , is already complete .",
    "at @xmath24 , instead , hdm is still differently distributed .",
    "moreover , @xmath4 s keep average velocities @xmath25 , of thermal origin .",
    "simulations are then performed with two kinds of particles , conventionally called cdm and hdm .",
    "cdm particles , however , account both for baryons and actual cdm .",
    "hdm particles , instead , account for @xmath4 behaviour and , since the beginning of the simulation , have quite a different treatment , according to their peculiar properties , including their large average velocity @xmath26 .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that , in a dissipationless simulation , we should seek baryons where we put them , @xmath27 with cdm _",
    "particles_.    previous authors , however , distinguished between galaxy and gas setting , even in dissipationless simulations .",
    "e.g. , kofman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who performed a pm simulation of mdm with 2 @xmath4 s of mass @xmath28ev and @xmath29 , in a box of @xmath30mpc ( @xmath31 ) , using @xmath32 particles and a force resolution @xmath33kpc ( hence a greater mass resolution and a slightly worse force resolution in a much smaller box , if compared with simulations described in this work ) , stated that distribution and motion of galaxies are primarily signatures of cdm particles .",
    "however , to try to spot x  ray emitting gas , they set it in hydrostatic equilibrium , assuming a spherically symmetric static gravitational potential given by a king  like profile , while the temperature profile was worked out using data on the x  ray surface brightness of the abell cluster a2256 , which is a rich , spherically symmetric , almost relaxed cluster , quite similar to coma .",
    "this kind of prescriptions are however almost useless if simulations are compared with galaxy data ; cdm and galaxy distributions can be assumed to be similar on the scales resolved in this work .",
    "therefore : ( i ) even in mixed models , to compare simulations with data , we define clusters using cdm particles only .",
    "( ii ) in order to evaluate cluster masses to fit data , we estimate them through the velocity distribution of cdm particles only .",
    "observational estimates , of course , are performed along a complex pattern .",
    "we shall be using recent results provided by girardi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , obtained using enacs data , and previous results of the same group ( biviano et al .",
    "1993 ) . in principle we should work out a mock catalog from our simulation and use it , so to reproduce all biases that data may have and use all prescriptions followed to try to overcome them .",
    "we plan to do so in a forthcoming work .",
    "meanwhile , however , it is clear that cluster masses are to be determined through velocity distributions .",
    "the procedure to work out such _ virial _ masses , aiming to approach what is done in observations , will be better described below .",
    "week gravitational lensing , instead , depends on the whole mass , carried either by cdm or hdm particles , through the potential it produces .",
    "we shall make no comparison here with masses obtained through lensing data . just notice that , according to our arguments , in mixed models , they may be grater than _ virial _",
    "masses by a factor which exceeds unity by more than @xmath34 .",
    "if we associate these points to the fact that cdm and hdm are distributed differently and expected to have different velocity distributions , it is clear that significant discrepancies from ps expectations can be present in mixed models .",
    "let us examine which could be their trend .",
    "first of all , cdm and hdm distributions are more and more alike as we go to greater scales . henceforth , above a suitable scale",
    ", the peculiarity of mixed models might become negligible .",
    "it is however hard to give an analytical estimate of such scale , if it exists .",
    "then , ps mass functions are worked out from transfer functions .",
    "if they are equal for the three components at low @xmath35 , we can expect that ps predictions hold if clusters are defined using both cold and hot particles .",
    "this expectation is however to be numerically verified . assuming that this is the case",
    ", the smoother distribution expected for @xmath4 s , in respect to cdm , may lead to a decrease of the amplitude of the actual cluster mass function .",
    "in particular , we shall see some examples where @xmath4 clouds around smaller cdm condensations create bridges among them . in similar cases , clusters defined using all particles turn into multiple systems of smaller objects , when only cdm particles are considered .",
    "but , quite in general , hdm is mostly periferal and helps to extend the volume where cdm particles are attributed to the cluster .",
    "forgetting hdm particles , therefore , leads to a decrease of the very cdm particles belonging to most clusters .",
    "this causes a decrease of cluster masses which may exceed the decrease due to neglecting hdm .",
    "its extent , however , is to be numerically tested .    however , besides using cdm particles only , we must recall that real mass measurements are not based on counts of particle _ numbers _ ; obviously , this can be done only in simulations .",
    "optical and @xmath36ray data , instead , are essentially obtained through velocities .",
    "if hdm particles tend to stay farther from the main condensations , preferring regions where the potential well is shallower , we can expect that cdm particles , in average , take an extra share of the overall kinetic energy , that will depend on detailed @xmath4 parameters .",
    "if their kinetic energy is used to test the cluster mass , we can expect a systematic overestimate .",
    "once again , a quantitative evaluation of the effect can hardly be obtained without numerical means .",
    "these are the main physical points that we wish to explore through our simulations .",
    "as we shall see , such effects do exist and are quantitatively relevant .",
    "exploring the world of mixed models can be particularly expensive , from the numerical point of view .",
    "in a given standard cdm ( scdm ) simulation , a change of normalization can be interpreted as a change of the time when @xmath23 ; furthermore , scdm can be turned into @xmath37cdm ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) by rescaling the box and the shape parameter @xmath38 , which , in the transfer function of @xmath37cdm models , always appears in the combination @xmath39 .",
    "( see section 3 for a discussion on the meaning of @xmath40 . )",
    "such multiple interpretations of a single simulation do not exist for mixed models .",
    "even apart of the @xmath37cdm variant , a change of normalization should be accompanied by a shift of the velocities of hot particles at the simulation start .    besides the restriction `` one model ",
    "one simulation '' , mixed models need at least 3 particles instead of 1 , to obtain the same level of resolution obtainable with pure cdm .",
    "in fact cdm and hdm components need different particles and the latter ones must be double in number , to account for thermal velocities , without introducing a spurious non  zero linear momentum density .",
    "further families of models which can be simulated using one kind of particles only are @xmath41cdm and models with total density parameter @xmath42 ( ocdm ) .",
    "the importance of @xmath41cdm models has greatly increased after an improved analyses of snia data ( @xcite ) indicated an accelerating cosmic expansion .",
    "ocdm models , instead , seem favoured by the presence of high redshift large scale matter condensations ( @xcite ) and by the statistics of arclets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter conclusions , however , might have to be partially reconsidered on the light of some results of this analysis .",
    "this work was made possible by our implementation of a parallel n ",
    "body code , based upon the serial public ap3 m code of couchman ( 1991 ) , extended in order to treat variable mass particle sets and used varying the time ",
    "steps , when needed .",
    "our simulation , dealing with a 360@xmath15mpc cubic box , needed either 180@xmath43 ( for pure cdm ) or @xmath44 ( for mdm ) particles .",
    "the force resolution is set by a plummer  equivalent smoothing parameter @xmath45kpc .",
    "our comoving force and mass resolutions approach the limits of the computational resources of the machine we used ( the hp exemplar spp2000 x class processor of the cilea consortium at segrate ",
    "such resolutions are close to the ones of the four simulations for pure cdm with different initial conditions described by colberg et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , or cole et al .",
    "see also gross et al .",
    "more details on the simulations are given on section 3 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss first the linear features of the models treated . in section 3",
    "we give all technical details concerning our simulations .",
    "their outputs are then used to show the evolution of the spectra ; the final spectrum , at @xmath23 , will then be compared with apm data and current approximated expressions , finding discrepancies which characterize mixed models ( section 4 ) . in section 5 , five different algorithms ,",
    "used to select clusters , are briefly discussed .",
    "an extended comparison among their outputs is outside the scope of this work ; our basic issues are contained in section 6 , where the effects of the presence of a hot component , on the cluster mass function , will be suitably summarized .",
    "section 7 is devoted to a final discussion .",
    "quite in general , to define a model we require : background metric , substance mix and primeval spectrum .",
    "the background metric is fixed by the hubble parameter @xmath46 and the overall density parameter @xmath47 ( @xmath48 : present average density , @xmath49 : critical density ) .",
    "substance is fixed by partial density parameters .",
    "e.g. , @xmath50 or @xmath51 , which are the ratios between baryon or cold  dark  matter ( cdm ) and critical densities .",
    "hot  dark  matter ( hdm ) is fixed by two of input data : besides of @xmath52 , we must give its number of spin degrees of freedom @xmath53 . in this paper , instead , @xmath54 .",
    "further quantities to be specified are the present cbr temperature and the effective number of massless@xmath4 spin degrees of freedom ( @xmath55 )",
    ". finally , early deviations from homogeneity are parametrized by the amplitude @xmath56 and the spectral index @xmath57 of the initial fluctuation spectrum @xmath58 ( here : @xmath59 is the comoving horizon distance ; @xmath60 is the wave  number related to the comoving length scale @xmath61 and mass scale @xmath62 ) .    in this section , we report predictions on large scale structure ( lss ) obtainable from the linear theory , for the models we simulated . in all our models @xmath63 and the hubble parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the other model parameters are shown in table i , together with the above mentioned predictions , worked out from transfer functions .",
    "transfer functions are obtained by solving numerically a large set of coupled differential equations .",
    "the set is particularly wide for mixed models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that a wide parameter space exists , for which mixed models are consistent with lss features that we can estimate within linear theory .    assuming the presence of scalar fluctuation modes only , in @xmath63 models , the angular fluctuation spectrum of cbr , for small @xmath64 values , can be approximated with its sachs & wolfe expression ( see , @xmath65 , @xcite ) : @xmath66 ( @xmath67 are bessel fuctions ) .",
    "as @xmath68 ( see , @xmath65 , @xcite ) the spectral amplitude @xmath56 is obtainable from data for @xmath69 .",

    ", there is the contribution of primeval gravitational waves to the observed @xmath69 value . as a working solution , in order to leave room for such signals , without spoiling the fit with cobe data , we decided to work out @xmath56 values from lower 3@xmath72 limits on @xmath69 .    to our knowledge ,",
    "simulations of mixed models with @xmath73 were never performed before , for any box size and dynamical range , except by lucchin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who however considered a model with @xmath74 and a single @xmath4 family , normalized to the central cobe value , and therefore significantly violating some linear constraints ( e.g. , @xmath75 , see below ) .",

    "for @xmath79 and 25 mpc , we evaluate @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which allow to work out @xmath82 the connection between this general definition and some current approximated expressions , like @xmath83 , can be found in @xcite .",

    "values of @xmath75 , obtained within the ps approach , are given in table i , for different models .",
    "an observational range is @xmath90 ( @xcite ) , but this result is still subject to a number of uncertainties and values within a factor 2 from upper and lower limits can not be safely rejected .",
    "however , even with such extra freedom , our mdm1 model would appear out of the observational range .",
    "we must however bear in mind that ps estimates are based on the transfer function at @xmath23 , which are almost identical for all dark matter and baryon components . as we shall see , non linear effects lead to greater condensations in cdm ( and baryons ) than in hdm , at all @xmath35 s .",
    "testing the consequences of such effects is one of the aims of this work . taking them into account , for reasons",
    "widely discussed below , @xmath75 may become substantially smaller and even mdm1 will be found compatible with data .",
    "further severe tests for tilted or mixed models concern the formation of structures at high @xmath35 . among them ,",
    "one of the most stringent is the amount of gas expected in damped lyman@xmath91 systems , which can be expressed through the parameter @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath91 is an efficiency parameter ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "let then @xmath94 be the mass variance , worked out from the transfer function @xmath95 , for the mass  scale @xmath14 at redshift @xmath35 . using its value , @xmath96~. \\eqno ( 2.7)\\ ] ] is easily obtained .",
    "accordingly , we evaluate @xmath97 , taking @xmath98 and @xmath99 in @xmath100 , @xmath101 and a top  hat window function ( see , however , @xcite ) .",

    "altogether , therefore , our models can be said to predict linear features consistent with most current linear observational constraints .",
    "the simulations start from the redshift @xmath104 .",
    "the particle sampling of the density field is obtained applying the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ) starting from a regular grid . for mdm models , the prescriptions of jing @xmath22 fang ( 1994 ) or borgani et al .",
    "( 1997 ) were followed ( see also the seminal paper by @xcite ) we adopt the same random phases in all simulated models .",
    "particular care is taken to treat the hdm component , sampled by couples of particles initially set in identical positions , with opposite thermal velocities , in order not to have a spurious linear momentum .",
    "henceforth , the simulation will contain a double number of hdm particles compared to cdm . in the definition of initial mode amplitudes ,",
    "the same random numbers were adopted for cold and hot components .",
    "this allows a fair fit of numerical and analitical amplitude growings , at the initial stages .",
    "as already mentioned , our simulations study a periodic cubic box of side @xmath105mpc .",
    "cdm+baryons are represented by @xmath106 particles , whose individual mass is @xmath107 for tcdm , @xmath108 for mdm1 and @xmath109 for mdm2 ; the mass of the @xmath110 hdm particles is @xmath111 for mdm1 and @xmath112 for mdm2 .",
    "outputs of the simulations are preserved at 20 intermediate redshifts @xmath113 set at constant time intervals @xmath114yr .",
    "the comoving force resolution is given by the softening length , @xmath115kpc .",
    "the force @xmath116 is evaluated considering each particle as a smoothed distribution of mass , with shape @xmath117 for @xmath118 ( this is the so  called s2 shape , @xcite ) .",
    "it behaves as @xmath119 when @xmath120 .",
    "since the softening of the force is usually referred to a plummer shape , @xmath121 , we used a least @xmath122 test to estabilish the best approximation between the forces generated by the two different shapes .",
    "the minimum @xmath122 occurs when @xmath123 . in our case",
    ", this corresponds to a plummer equivalent softening @xmath124kpc ; we will use this latter value of the softening as our nominal force resolution .    for the sake of comparison , the numerical simulations of colberg et al .",

    "gross et al . ( 1998 ) using a parallelized standard pm code simulated a mixed model and various cdm variants in a box containing @xmath131 particles and @xmath132 grid points .",
    "they performed simulations both at high and low resolution in boxes @xmath133 and @xmath134mpc wide which correspond grid sizes of @xmath135 and @xmath136kpc .",
    "the claimed softening is @xmath137 times the grid size .",
    "the program used to compute the evolution of particles , under the action of gravitational forces , is a parallel code developed starting from the public ap3 m serial code of couchman ( 1991 ) .",
    "such code divides the interparticle forces in long range and short range ones .",
    "the long range forces are accounted for by the pm ( _ particle mesh _ )",
    "part , which solves the equations of gravitation in the fourier space , where they are essentially algebric , making use of fft to transfer results from coordinate to momentum space and _ viceversa_. the resolution of pm calculations is set by the number of grid cells , that we fixed at @xmath138 .",
    "further resolution , in our case down to 0.08@xmath139 , is attained by direct summation between neighbour particles in the pp ( _ particle particle _ ) part . however , where the particle density attains or exceeds @xmath140 times the mean value , the evaluation of the short range forces is performed by repeating the above scheme ( refinement ) , therefore furtherly subdividing the forces in long and short range ones , and treating them with a pm and pp calculation respectively .",
    "the boundary conditions for the refinements are therefore not periodic .",
    "if the refinement volumes still contain high  density regions , the refinement process can continue to deeper levels .",
    "the parallelization of the code was made taking into account the technical characteristics of the hp exemplar spp2000 x class processor of the cilea consortium ( segrate  milan ) we employed . the machine architecture",
    "is shared  memory .",
    "this architecture allows to parallelize the calculation without explicitly managing the data distribution .",
    "the spp2000 of cilea is composed by two hypernodes , each with 16 hp pa  risc 8000 processors and a total memory of 4@xmath21gbyte .",
    "the code worked on a hypernode of the machine , using 8 of its processors .",
    "this is due to system  specific requirements .",
    "the memory resources we used were up to @xmath141 and @xmath142gbyte ( out of @xmath143gbyte of shared memory available ) for tcdm and mdm , respectively .",
    "approximately half required memory is spent to store particle coordinates , momenta and masses .",
    "the rest of ram is then needed for all other calculation purposes ( density field storage , fft overhead storage , etc . ) .",
    "the main effort to parallelize the program was concentrated on pp , both at level 0 and refinements .",
    "once the pm part is executed , pp calculations at level 0 are shared among available processors , as the linked ",
    "list mechanism of the code automatically divides consequently the different volumes where the pp calculation is being performed .",
    "when the threshold for refinement is attained , the related operations are executed by a single processor .",
    "further refinements are assigned to another processor , etc . ; this allows to execute , with the setup we used , up to 8 refinements simultaneously .    as is usual ,",
    "let us define the speed ",
    "up @xmath144 as the ratio of the cpu time used for serial execution versus the solar time spent for parallel execution on @xmath145 processors .",
    "our program speed ",
    "up is @xmath146 for the pp part at the first steps , but , as is expected , @xmath147 slows down to @xmath148 at the last steps , due to unbalancing .",
    "as far as refinements are concerned , we reach a value @xmath149 at the last steps .",
    "the pm part , instead , has no substantial advantage from using system parallel fft . altogether , the speedup remains roughly constant along the simulations , because of the increasing computational weight of the short range calculus , as clustering develops and , in average , never overtakes a value @xmath150 .",
    "the number of steps made was different for the 3 simulations .",
    "1000 equal @xmath145time steps were used for tcdm ( the time parameter @xmath151 ; at these late redshifts , the expansion is nearly matter  dominated , also in the presence of the hdm component , and equal @xmath145 intervals yield equal time intervals ) .",
    "mdm1 , instead , was run splitting each of the first 100 above steps into two equal parts .",
    "hence it used 1100 time steps .",
    "the time step choice for mdm2 was more complex .",
    "with reference to the 1000 equal time steps ( as used for tcdm ) , we give a succession of number pairs ; the former one indicates the step numbers out of 1000 , the latter one the step numbers they have became ( in order to fulfill the criteria outlined herebelow ) : [ 2,10 ]  [ 23,92 ]  [ 50,100 ]  [ 125,125 ]  [ 800,400 ] .",
    "such step choices were dictated by two criteria : ( i ) energy conservation . according to layzer irvine equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it had an overall violation @xmath152 for tcdm and mdm2 and @xmath153 for mdm1 .",
    "( ii ) cole et al .",
    "( 1997 ) requirements , that the rms displacement of particles in a step is @xmath154 and the fastest particle has a displacement @xmath155 were never violated .",
    "in fact , for mdm1 , the ( ii ) criterion would have been violated in the first 100 of 1000 equal time  steps , because of the residual thermal velocity of @xmath4 s .",
    "the problem was even more serious for mdm2 .",
    "this led to the subdivision of the initial part of the runs .",
    "however , we also performed the initial 10@xmath156 of mdm1 in 100 time  steps , thus violating the cole criterion .",
    "final particle positions are displaced up to 1.6@xmath157 , although the average displacement can hardly be distinguished from computational noise .",
    "( similar displacements are found when the same program is run on two different machines . ) accordingly , no discrepancy is present in spectra .",
    "we should therefore conclude that the ( ii ) criterion is perhaps too restrictive .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show 3 slices ( one for each simulation ) , @xmath158mpc@xmath43 wide , of the simulation volume at @xmath23 , projected along their shortest side . approximately half of cdm particles are showed .",

    "( ii ) mdm1,2 show more pronounced features on a greater scale , in respect to tcdm .",
    "this should be ascribed to the lack of power on intermediate scales ( 100500@xmath15mpc ) , which is one of the characteristics ( and problems ) of tilted models ; the shape of the spectra of the two models at @xmath23 can be seen in fig .",

    "the two intermediate redshifts correspond to fractions 0.1 and 0.3 of the total time of non  linear evolution @xmath174 .",
    "a further comment concerns the evolution of the spectrum of the hot component in mdm .",
    "its high@xmath175 rise at @xmath176 is a well  known feature , appearing in mixed simulations , and originates from shot noise , as hot particles cover distances greater than cell sizes , because of thermal motions .",
    "several attempts are reported , in the literature , to reduce such effect ( an obvious way amounts to increasing the total number of particles used to simulate the hot component ) and to evaluate how far it can affect final results . in this work",

    "elsewhere , we plan to discuss such effect in more detail , stressing a peculiar feature , which is to be overcame and however risks to cause unphysical differences among simulations of the same model with different numbers of hot particles , unless suitable cautions are taken .",

    "one of the main aims of the simulations is that of obtaining a large set of model clusters for each cosmological model , at various redshifts . this will enable us to study cluster evolution and to create mock cluster catalogs .",
    "it is not clear , instead , how far the global cluster morphology can be understood within the frame of non dissipative simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we shall report some basic results and general properties of the clusters selected in the simulation outputs .",

    "let us now describe our so procedure implementation .",
    "as a first step , candidate clusters are located using a standard fof algorithm , with linking length @xmath187 ( here @xmath188 is the average particle  particle separation ) , giving as outputs groups with more than @xmath189 particles .",
    "we then perform the following operations : ( i ) we find the center  of  mass @xmath190 of each group and ( ii ) we determine the radius @xmath191 , inside which the density contrast is @xmath192 ( all particles are to be included , not only those initially found by fof ) . in general , the new center  of",

    ", it may happen that the same particle is a potential member of two particle groups . in this case",
    "the procedure assigns it to the more massive one . as a matter of fact",
    ", this has the consequence that , sometimes , more massive groups swallow smaller ones .",
    "a consequence of this choice is a slight decrease of the total number of clusters , over all mass scales , and this is confirmed by some preliminary comparisons described below .",
    "in fact , before using this procedure on our simulations , we performed a number of checks on test simulations of the same cosmological models , with a smaller mass resolution ( @xmath193 64 ^ 3 $ ] particles , in the same volume ) .",
    "clusters found by our so procedure were compared with those found by other standard public cluster identification algorithms , namely : fof ( @xcite , http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/fof ) itself , hop ( @xcite ; http://www.sns.ias.edu/~ eisenste / hop / hop.html ) and denmax / skid ( http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/skid ) .",
    "we confirm a good agreement between the cumulative cluster mass functions @xmath184 obtained using group masses from fof ( @xmath194 ) and hop ( suitably tuning its parameters ) , and that most massive hop clusters show a systematic offset towards greater masses ( @xcite ) . the mass function found by denmax (",
    "again suitably tuned ) finds a slightly smaller @xmath184 , while the so mass function mostly lays slightly below all of them .",
    "discrepancies are however small , in spite of being enhanced by the reduced mass resolution in the test simulations",
    ". the results of a detailed comparison among different cluster finders , applied to higher resolution simulations , will be presented elsewhere , stressing also morphological differences .",

    "two features can be easily seen even by eye : ( i ) the location of clusters is similar in the three simulations , as is to be expected , as they are started with the same random numbers .",
    "( ii ) in average , mdm1 clusters are more massive than tcdm , but not so numerous .",
    "qualitative differences between mdm2 and tcdm are not so striking .    in fig .",

    "can be fairly easily understood and are really minor effects , when one considers how complex is the problem that the theoretical ps expression tries to face .",
    "discrepancies can be expressed through the dependence of @xmath6 on scales and models .",
    "for all models @xmath6 decreases when passing from smaller to greater scales .",
    "however , while for mdm1 it starts from values exceeding 1.8 , at scales @xmath198 , for mdm2 , 1.8 is never exceeded and , for tcdm , the start occurs for @xmath199 . from @xmath200 to @xmath201 , @xmath6 approximately decreases by 0.1 ( some irregularity seems however present in mdm2 ) . at even greater scales",
    "a further excess is met , leading to values @xmath6 up to @xmath202 , for tcdm .",
    "although the final @xmath6 is smaller for mdm1 and mdm2 , the excess of large mass clusters met in mdm1 is greater .",

    "the scale dependence is thought to arise because of deviations from spherical isolated growth",
    ". the smaller number of clusters we find in mixed simulations , instead , can be attributed to a slower gravitational growth , caused by the enhanced thermal velocities in one of the matter components .    however , when mixed model predictions are to be compared with optical observations , the above analysis is unsuitable , as already argued in the introduction . with the resolution allowed by our simulations ,",
    "hydrodynamical effects are expected to be negligible .",
    "baryons emitting light are therefore to be sought where they are initially set , when cdm _ particles _ were distributed at @xmath24 , using the ( already coincident ) transfer functions of cdm and baryons and granting them an overall density parameter @xmath203 .",
    "only hydrodynamics could separate cdm from baryons .",
    "let us remind that , instead , hdm particles were initially distributed according to a ( still ) different transfer function , their evolution permanently resented initial thermal velocities , which baryons certainly do not have , and they have a @xmath23 spatial distribution different from cdm particles , namely in those sites where non  linearity forced cdm to evolve so rapidly that hdm could not overcome its pace and reach it . in the introduction we reported on attempts by previous authors to locate baryons in non  hydro mixed simulations .",
    "suitable prescriptions were suggested to disentangle gas from cdm , in simulations with higher resolution than ours ; however , even with such greater resolution , no doubt was cast on the fact that galaxies are cdm tracers .    at @xmath173 ,",

    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , where 2dimensional projections of 4 clusters from mdm1 and mdm2 simulations are shown , such differences are evident . in fact , an eye inspection of cdm and hdm distributions shows that dense knots are mostly populated by cdm particles , while the hdm particle distribution is significantly smoother .",
    "e.g. , the second cluster in fig .  [ fig8 ] has a triple structure in cdm , which is almost absent in hdm .",
    "a similar situation holds for the third one , whose double structure is erased at the hdm particle level .",
    "the last two clusters are lighter ones , but it is still visible how central knots are essentially made by cdm particles .",
    "similar features are visible ( and perhaps stronger , probably because hdm particles are even lighter ) for mdm2 .",
    "multiple features and knots , present in cdm distributions , are attenuated or vanish in hdm .",
    "similar properties can be observed in broedbeck et al .",

    "accordingly , their cluster sample is 40 times less numerous than ours .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that multiple clusters , such as those shown in the second and third panels of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , are , in a sense , survivors . in most cases ,",
    "cdm bridges are not adequate to unify the smaller condensations .",
    "then we identify several smaller clusters instead of a big single one .",
    "but , more often , some of the smaller condensations pass below the lower mass threshold and do not contribute to the cluster mass function .",
    "these effects are unique to identifying clusters with cdm particles only in mixed simulations ; if we use all particles , we find a consistent extra number of multiple clusters like the ones shown in fig .",

    "we conclude that most features expected in mixed model simulations are indeed present .",
    "let us now quantify them .",
    "in order to pass from cluster masses as sums of particle masses , to cluster masses comparable with optical data , two operations are to be performed .",

    "the difference becomes gradually smaller for greater and greater mass scales .",
    "the behaviour , however , depends on the matter mix and it may be premature to give an expression for cluster abundance reduction , on various mass scales . moreover , the method used to select particles belonging to a cluster , which has already an impact in defining masses according to the ( ii ) criterion , bears an even greater effect on the ( iii ) criterion : here , adding or subtracting a few high  speed particles may significantly change @xmath205 ; the operational assumption of spherical symmetry in the so and similar procedures , in principle , might cause significant @xmath207 shifts , for intrinsically non  spherical clusters .",
    "( let us mention that procedures allowing non ",

    "the difference between mdm1 and mdm2 is to be ascribed to the different amounts of hdm .",

    "in particular we found that the actual number of clusters _ produced _ by a mixed model is significantly smaller than the amount predicted by ps estimates . on a scale @xmath231 ,",
    "as the one usually adopted to test models using their transfer function , the reduction factor is @xmath2320.8 .",
    "simulations were actually compared with optical observational data ( biviano et al .",
    "1993 , girardi et al .",
    "the latter data are obtained from a much wider sample , but most discrepancies arise just from the treatment of observational biases .",
    "the mass function obtained from simulations directly excludes some of such biases , e.g. , the presence of interlopers . some other corrections might however be needed before the comparison is safe , which might cause a further decrease of estimated cluster masses . accordingly , although mdm2 seems quite consistent with observations and provides an excellent fit of data at various mass scales , also mdm1 can not be safely excluded .",
    "ps estimates are to be decreased by a suitable ( smaller ) factor , also for cdm , in accordance with previous findings of cen ( 1997 ) .    in this work",
    "we did not pursue a comparison of simulations with x  ray data on cluster abundance ( see , e.g. eke et al .",
    "they are known to be in fair agreement with optical data for @xmath233@xmath234 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "9a in @xcite ) . at lower masses",
    "various problems are to be solved , both concerning the completeness of real cluster samples and the dynamics of gas in simulated clusters .",
    "one of our findings is the significant reduction of optical cluster masses , when external layers , connected by hdm bridges , are no longer included in the mass computation . in the analysis of real cluster samples , galaxies belonging to such layers",
    "would appear as interlopers and an eye analysis of fig .",
    "7 of @xcite seems to confirm that including ( at least some of ) the interlopers might rise the cluster mass function , approaching ps estimates .",
    "this point was not deepened in this analysis , as the natural approach is through the use of mock catalogs , as we plan to do in a forthcoming work .",
    "cen ( 1997 ) analysis of the relation between virial mass estimates @xmath207 and real masses @xmath14 is widened here to mixed models .",
    "we find that the @xmath235 ratios depend on the cluster mass scale .",
    "in general , the relation between cluster virial mass estimates and real cluster masses , is likely to depend on dark matter nature .",
    "the hypothesis of isothermal distribution of particles , inside clusters , is also found to yield masses ( slightly ) smaller than real , in pure cdm simulations . in mixed simulations",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath207 and cold particle masses is smaller than in pure cdm . on the contrary , taking into account also hdm particles , the gap is substantially greater and shows a significant scale dependence , although the detailed trend depends on the substance of the model .",
    "let us finally outline that , at variance with what tends to happen for galactic mass systems , the abundance of early clusters , in mixed models , tends to exceed cdm . in our volume of 360@xmath15mpc , 2 clusters with mass @xmath236 ( with @xmath237 )",
    "were found in the mdm1 simulation .",
    "also mdm2 provides a cluster abundance compatible with donahue et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observational findings .",
    "such numbers , however , are too small , both on the observational and on the simulation sides , to provide real confirms of models .",
    "we thank the consortium cilea for allowing us to run a former trial simulation free of charge and a particular thank is due to giampaolo bottoni of cilea , for his expert technical assistance .",
    "elena donghia , who gave us useful suggestions for the parallelization of the pp part of the code , is also to be gratefully thanked .",
    "hugh couchman is to be thanked for making public his ap3 m serial code and for some private communications .",
    "anatoly klypin is also to be thanked for accurate discussions of several points of this work .",

    "<S> we argue that , in our non  hydro simulations , where cdm particles describe both actual cdm and baryons , the galaxy distribution traces cdm particles . therefore , we use them to define clusters and their velocities to work out cluster masses . as cdm particles </S>",

    "<S> such predictions agree with simulations if both hdm and cdm are used to define clusters . </S>",
    "<S> if this criterion is adopted , however , we see that : ( i ) mdm corresponds @xmath6 values slightly but systematically greater than cdm ; ( ii ) such @xmath6 exhibit a scale dependence : on scales @xmath7 , we find @xmath6@xmath8 or 1.8 for cdm or mdm , respectively ; at greater scales the required @xmath6 decreases and a substantial cluster excess is found , at the large mass end ( @xmath9 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> clusters defined through cdm in mdm models , instead , are less numerous than ps estimates , by a factor @xmath10 , at the low mass end ; the factor becomes @xmath110.8 , depending on the mix , on intermediate mass scales ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) and almost vanishes on the high mass end . </S>",
    "<S> therefore : ( i ) mdm models expected to overproduce clusters over intermediate scales are viable ; ( ii ) the greater reduction factor at small scales agrees with the observational data dependence on the cluster mass @xmath14 ( which , however , may be partially due to sample incompleteness ) ; ( iii ) the higher spectral normalization is felt at large scales , where mdm models produce more objects ( hence , large clusters ) than cdm . </S>",
