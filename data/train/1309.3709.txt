    "since half a century ago , the hubbard model has been widely studied as a simple model accounting for several nontrivial phenomena in electronic systems , such as the mott insulator , ( anti)ferromagnetism , and novel superconductivity@xcite .",
    "its bosonic version , the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model , has been appreciably investigated for more than two decades@xcite .",
    "the bh model not only aptly describes the many - body behavior of bosons in lattices , but also serves as a good and simple example for understanding how competition between two common mechanisms , localization and itineracy , can drive matter toward extremely different phases , namely mott - insulator ( mi ) or superfluid .",
    "the mi phase , characterized by commensurate occupations , gapped excitations and incompressibility , undergoes a transition to a superfluid , characterized by bose - einstein condensation , gapless excitations and finite compressibility , as the ratio of tunneling to interaction energy increases beyond a density - dependent critical value .",
    "differently from the fermionic case , the bosonic nature allows the bh phase diagram of multiple mi regions for all possible integer occupations , surrounded by the superfluid region .",
    "various realizations of the bh model have been early suggested in granular systems with an embedded condensate , such as a josephson junction array@xcite or liquid helium in porous media@xcite , and later in lattice bosons , such as bosonic atoms in optical lattices@xcite or exciton - polaritons in an array of microcavities@xcite .",
    "recent achievements in cold - atom experiments have successfully created inhomogeneous bh systems and realized the mi - superfluid transition@xcite as well as a spatially separated structure of multiple mis@xcite .",
    "these multiple applications have stimulated a broad interest in the bh physics and lead to an active study of a great variety of bh models @xcite .",
    "recently , a theoretical investigation we carried out on imbalanced fermionic superfluids in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of coupled tubes@xcite [ a setup which has been experimentally realized@xcite in the search for the elusive fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state@xcite ] has shown an exotic compressible - incompressible quantum phase transition of the tube occupation of unpaired majority fermions ( umfs ) in the system .",
    "the phase diagram obtained from the microscopic model of fermions exhibits similarities and contrasts to the structure as a bh phase diagram . on the one hand",
    "there is a phase with well defined umf occupation numbers in each tube . on the other hand , the occupations of the incompressible ( mi ) regions are either all even or all odd .",
    "the similarities reflect the competition between the ontube energy and cross - tube kinetics of the umfs and hence suggests an effective description of the ( projected ) system by a 2d bh model , while the contrasts suggest the need for an additional term in the effective model that `` orients '' the occupation parities ( see sec .",

    "motivated by this previous work ,",
    "we study an extended bh model having a ferromagneticlike coupling between occupation parities of nearest - neighbor sites . this proposed coupling can be pictured as domain - wall energies between nearest - neighbor sites of opposite occupation parities , reminiscent of local magnetization kinks in the ferromagnetic ising model@xcite , resulting in a ground state that favors all the sites having the same occupation parity .",
    "the parity coupling shows interesting interplays with the other two original bh ingredients , single - particle tunneling and onsite repulsion .",
    "first , it is antagonistic toward the single - particle tunneling process , during which two involved neighbor sites flip the parity and form domain walls between themselves and the surrounding sites [ see illustration in figs .  [",
    "fig : f01](a ) and [ fig : f01](b ) ] .",
    "second , it is different from the onsite repulsion in that it drives the system to accept additional doping as pairs rather than single particles , to avoid the domain wall energy , while the onsite repulsion does the opposite as a way to reduce the interaction energy [ see fig .",

    "we will suggest two possible experimental realizations for exploring the model in cold atomic and condensed matter systems . we shall find a rich phase diagram for the uniform case in the zero - tunneling limit , reflecting different doping preferences driven by the parity coupling and onsite repulsion .",
    "for the finite - tunneling case , we apply two commonly used treatments , quantum monte carlo@xcite ( qmc ) and gutzwiller mean - field@xcite ( gmf ) methods , on trapped systems , thus successfully describing the state of the system as the parity coupling increases for finite tunneling . in the large - tunneling regime , we identify an exotic pair superfluid state , which emerges with a different mechanism from previously studied ones@xcite .",

    "the extended bh model with occupation - parity couplings between nearest - neighbor sites is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a bosonic operator on site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number operator , @xmath10 is the number - parity operator , @xmath11 is the local chemical potential and @xmath12 denotes a pair of neighboring sites .",
    "the non - negative parameters @xmath13 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 give the strength of nearest - neighbor tunneling , ferromagnetic - like nearest - neighbor parity coupling and onsite repulsion , respectively .",

    "the presence of @xmath1 terms can be regarded as an energy cost of domain walls between two neighboring sites with different number parities . from this point of view",

    "the system has the geometry of a 2d array composed of one - dimensional ( 1d ) tubes that has been realized in experiments@xcite .",
    "in such a system it is the behavior of spin imbalance per tube , or the fillings of umfs , that undergoes a transition from a compressible state ( umf move easily across tubes ) to a mi ( umfs are localized on each tube ) , yielding a similar phase diagram to the regular bh one except the filling numbers of the mi phases are either all even or all odd while they can be any integer in the regular case . regarding the projection of this anisotropic three - dimensional fermionic system to an effective 2d lattice model described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ham0 ] ) , we find the tunneling @xmath13 and on - site interaction @xmath0 as a result from the interplay of the lattice geometry , on - tube interaction , and on - tube pairing order .",
    "the occupation - parity coupling @xmath1 comes from the domain - wall energy between two neighboring tubes having different spatial parities of the oscillatory superconducting order parameter , which is directly related to the occupation parity of umfs . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : dbh ] , we present a detailed derivation showing how the physics of umfs is effectively described by eq .",

    "the three coupling fields @xmath0 , @xmath154 , and @xmath157 are introduced after employing a bogoliubove  de gennes ( bdg ) treatment@xcite on the original hamiltonian of a quartic form ; which includes , besides the single - particle hamiltonian , a two - body point - contact interaction and ( possible ) pair tunneling .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath158 can be solved in a quasiparticle basis , resulting in a set of @xmath159 that self - consistently describes the equilibrium state of the system ( see detailed discussions in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] as well as a wide application of this treatment on similar systems  @xcite ) .",
    "the self - consistent solutions show that in the presence of spin imbalance , the system can accommodate an oscillatory pairing order @xmath154 along the tube axis ( the fflo state@xcite ) . for a single tube or uncoupled tubes",
    ", each umf is localized around a node of the pairing order parameter such that the total numbers of nodes and umfs are equal .",
    "given the spatially symmetric confinement along the tube axis , e.g. , a harmonic trap , a tube with odd ( even ) imbalance has a pairing node ( antinode ) at the tube center .",
    "in particular , the localized umfs can be regarded as occupied andreev bound states@xcite , resulting in an imbalance profile like separated solitons@xcite if the spatial distribution of the pairing nodes is relatively sparse or like a ripple@xcite if it is dense .",
    "( the same signatures have also been found in isotropic three - dimensional hubbard lattices@xcite or coupled hubbard chains@xcite . )",
    "both configurations arise from the same effect of localization and can be characterized as the spatial concurrence of imbalance peaks and pairing nodes .",
    "the localization of umfs suppresses the degrees of freedom in the @xmath146 direction and hence allows us to construct an effective 2d lattice model describing the physics of umfs with only the @xmath160 degree of freedom .",
    "we remark that even if umfs localize along the @xmath146 direction , they can still be mobile in the@xmath160 direction , constituting the physics of interests as discussed below .",
    "in such a 2d model the state in the @xmath146 direction is taken as a hidden degree of freedom of a lattice site .",
    "( this idea has also been applied on bosonic gases in tubular lattices@xcite , in which the multiorbital wave functions in the tube direction are incorporated into on - site degrees of freedom for an effective 2d model across the tubes . ) the hidden degrees of freedom here can be directly related in one - to - one correspondence to the site occupation number , and since more than single occupation per site are possible , this suggests a bosonic description for the modeling .",
    "formally , one can still keep the anticommutation relation in the @xmath160 direction by using a combined operator @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a bosonic operator accounting for occupation - related physics and @xmath163 is a majorana fermion operator carrying the statistical property of the original fermions . based on this decoupling ,",
    "we build our model step by step below .",
    "first , for coupled tubes , the pairing nodes tend to line up at the same @xmath37 positions on each tube@xcite .",
    "the leading kinetics across the tubes is the transverse tunneling of an umf from a pairing node in a tube to the corresponding one in the nearest neighbor .",
    "the one - particle tunneling of minority fermions is suppressed provided they are all paired ( at low temperature ) . because a node is surrounded by other nodes where the pairing is zero",
    ", the tunneling field reduces to a free particle tunneling strength@xcite , @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , considering the order - parameter configuration in @xmath153 that limits the kinetics in @xmath155 to be only for the umfs , we obtain the tunneling term in the model as @xmath165    second , if the coupling between the tubes is weak enough , the on - site energy is mainly contributed by the on - tube kinetics , hartree energy , pairing energy , and chemical potentials , all of which are determined once the on - site filling ( of umfs ) is given . the self - consistent calculation in ref .",
    "[ ] shows that the on - site energy is nonlinear and can be fitted by a repulsive interaction @xmath0 plus a chemical potential @xmath151 . as a result ,",
    "the on - tube energies @xmath150 and @xmath153 effectively become the on - site terms of our model as @xmath166 where @xmath167 .",
    "third , the bdg calculations show that the system energy rises if two nearest - neighbor tubes have different spatial parities of the oscillatory pairing order parameter .",
    "such energy increase comes from a drastic mismatch in the order parameters and can be regarded as a cost of domain - wall formation , exhibiting similar physics to that in superconducting @xmath168 junctions@xcite or weakly imbalanced cold atomic gases@xcite .",
    "because the spatial parity of the order parameter is equal to the occupation parity of the umfs , one can describe the domain - wall physics with the occupation - parity coupling between nearest - neighbor sites in the bh model , @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the onsite parity operator and @xmath1 is the unit - length energy of domain walls .    finally , by collecting all terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : ham2a])([eqn : ham2c ] ) we obtain an effective hamiltonian , @xmath171 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum\\limits_{\\bf{r } } { \\left [ { \\frac{u}{2}{{\\hat n}_{\\bf{r}}}({{\\hat n}_{\\bf{r } } } - 1 ) - \\mu { { \\hat n}_{\\bf{r } } } } \\right]}.\\label{eqn : ham2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the physical quantities of interest to be addressed here can be expressed as local static ( or equal - time ) correlations of the ground state , not involving the exchange of particles , the statistics ( majorana sector ) factors out .",
    "therefore , by replacing @xmath172 with @xmath173 ( and allowing the chemical potential to vary in space ) , we arrive at the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ham0 ] ) . considering a typical experimental setup@xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath174 , @xmath175@xmath176 in the range of optical lattice depth being 123@xmath177 , and @xmath178 ( regime of the wedding - cake structure of even - filling mis ) , where @xmath179 is the binding energy of a pair of fermions and @xmath177 is the recoil energy .",
    "one can also expect a high tunability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 via the tuning of the feshbach - resonant@xcite interactions and the overall trapping potential used in the experiments .",

    "<S> we study a bose - hubbard model having on - site repulsion , nearest - neighbor tunneling , and ferromagneticlike coupling between occupation parities of nearest - neighbor sites . for a uniform system in any dimension at zero tunneling </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an exact phase diagram characterized by mott - insulator ( mi ) and pair liquid phases and regions of phase separation of two mis . for a general trapped system in one and two dimensions with finite tunneling , we perform quantum monte carlo and gutzwiller mean - field calculations , both of which show the evolution of the system , as the parity coupling increases , from a superfluid to wedding - cake - structure mis with their occupations jumping by 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify an exotic pair superfluid at relatively large tunneling strength . </S>",
    "<S> our model ought to effectively describe recent findings in imbalanced fermi gases in two - dimensional optical lattices and also potentially apply to an anisotropic version of bilinear - biquadratic spin systems . </S>"
