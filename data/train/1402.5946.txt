    "in many situations , geometric objects come parametrized by the elements of an affine space @xmath2 over a field @xmath3 or @xmath4 ; the elements of @xmath2 can usually be divided into `` generic '' and `` singular '' ( what exactly we call `` singular '' depends on the particular example we are considering ) .",
    "the subset @xmath5 of @xmath2 formed by the singular elements is called a ( generalized ) _ discriminant_. to give an example , one can take the space of polynomials of some fixed degree over @xmath6 as @xmath2 , and the subset of @xmath2 formed by the polynomials having a multiple root in @xmath6 as @xmath5 .",
    "notice that in this example @xmath5 is the zero locus of a polynomial in the coefficients of @xmath7 ; this polynomial is called the discriminant , which maybe justifies the use of the term `` discriminant '' in a more general situation .",
    "more examples will be considered below .    due to the alexander duality",
    "@xmath8 computing ( additively ) the cohomology of @xmath9 is equivalent to computing the borel - moore homology groups of @xmath5 .",
    "( recall that the borel - moore homology groups @xmath10 of a locally compact topological space @xmath11 can be defined either as the homology of the one - point compactification of @xmath11 modulo the `` infinity '' or as the homology groups of the complex of locally finite singular chains ; the latter definition generalizes to arbitrary local systems in an obvious way . )",
    "if one is interested in the borel - moore homology groups , one can often replace @xmath5 with a much more tractable space @xmath12 called a _ resolution _ of @xmath5 .",
    "the resolution @xmath12 comes with a natural filtration such that the difference of two consecutive terms is a fiber bundle over a `` nice '' space . in some examples",
    "this reduces the computation of @xmath10 to ( possibly lengthy ) but elementary manipulations . in the case when the elements of @xmath5 can have only discrete singular loci ,",
    "such resolutions are called _ simplicial _ ; they were first constructed by v. a. vassiliev in @xcite , although one can trace the idea ( as well as in fact , a large part of homological algebra ) all the way back to euler s `` inclusion - exclusion '' formula ) .",
    "conical resolutions were introduced by v. a. vassiliev in @xcite as a generalization of simplicial resolutions for the case of non - discrete singular sets ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite v.",
    "a.  vassiliev applied conical resolutions to compute the rational cohomology of the spaces of nonsingular degree @xmath13 hypersurfaces in @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in order to overcome some difficulties involved in extending the computations performed in @xcite to other examples , the author gave in @xcite a modified construction of conical resolutions based on the inclusion relations between the singular loci , rather than between the corresponding linear systems .",
    "this modified construction was presented from the viewpoint of cubical schemes by o. tommasi @xcite .",
    "the approach of o. tommasi enables one to recover the mixed hodge structures on the borel - moore homology groups of the discriminant .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the constructions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the point of generalizing can be explained as follows .",
    "natural filtrations on the conical resolutions of @xcite typically contain a lot of terms corresponding to `` fake '' singular loci .",
    "this does not present a problem in @xcite , since a vast majority of these terms makes no contribution ( over @xmath17 ) to the spectral sequence corresponding to the filtration .",
    "however , if we consider other examples ( and in particular , the spaces of nodal hypersurfaces we shall be interested in in this paper ) , the situation turns out to be different . while it is still true that most columns of term @xmath18 of the spectral sequence are zero , many of the corresponding columns of @xmath19 are not ( even rationally ) .",
    "we address the problem by putting together some parasitic terms of the filtration that are destined to kill each other in the end .",
    "this procedure may be seen as an adaptation of v.  a.  vassiliev s construction of reduced conical resolutions @xcite to the context of  @xcite .",
    "we apply our method to compute the rational cohomology ( together with the mixed hodge structures ) of the spaces of equations of nodal cubics in @xmath20 , and of the space of nodal quartics in @xmath0 .",
    "mixed hodge structures can be encoded as follows . for a complex algebraic variety @xmath11",
    ", we define the _ mixed hodge polynomial _ of @xmath11 to be @xmath21 by setting in this expression @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 , we get the poincar - serre polynomial , respectively , the poincar polynomial , of @xmath2 .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the space of homogeneous degree @xmath13 complex polynomials in @xmath25 variables , and we set @xmath26 to be the subvariety of @xmath24 formed by all @xmath27 such that the kernel of the hessian matrix of @xmath27 at a nonzero point @xmath28 contains a 2-plane @xmath29 ( or , equivalently , the hypersurface defined by @xmath27 has a singularity other than a simple node ) .",
    "[ mhcubp2 ] we have @xmath30    [ mhquartp2 ] we have @xmath31    [ mhcubp3 ] we have @xmath32    we use theorems [ mhquartp2 ] and [ mhcubp3 ] to compute the mixed hodge polynomials of the corresponding moduli spaces .",
    "[ mhqmod ] we have @xmath33    [ mhcmod ] we have @xmath34    let us note that the moduli space @xmath35 of nodal cubic surfaces was studied in @xcite from the viewpoint of complex hyperbolic geometry ; in particular , it was shown there that this space is the quotient of the complex hyperbolic 4-space by a certain discrete group @xmath36 acting with finite stabilizers .",
    "this means that @xmath35 is a `` rational @xmath37 '' , i.e. , the rational cohomology of @xmath36 is canonically isomorphic to the rational cohomology of @xmath35 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ conres ] we construct conical resolutions of discriminants . in section [ nod ]",
    "we show how the method of section [ conres ] applies to the equation spaces of nodal hypersurfaces and prove theorem [ mhcubp2 ] .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ mhquartp2 ] and [ mhqmod ] are given in section [ quartics ] .",
    "finally , in section [ cubics ] we prove theorems [ mhcubp3 ] and [ mhcmod ] .    in the following table",

    "the verification of condition [ five ] is now straightforward @xmath45 .",
    "now we apply theorem [ thconical ] to construct a conical resolution @xmath12 of @xmath5 and a filtration @xmath46 theorem [ mhquartp2 ] follows immediately from    [ spseqqvector ] let @xmath47 be the spectral sequence over @xmath17 corresponding to this filtration",
