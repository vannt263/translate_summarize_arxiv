    "recently hoava proposed a power - counting renormalizable theory of gravity  @xcite , which has attracted much attention over the past year . in hoava",
    "s theory , lorentz symmetry is broken and it exhibits a lifshitz - like anisotropic scaling in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , @xmath6 , with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "( for this reason the theory is called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity . )",
    "it is then natural to expect that the uv behavior of the theory would give rise to new scenarios of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "earlier works have indeed revealed some interesting aspects of hl cosmology such as dark matter as integration constant  @xcite , the generation of chiral gravitational waves from inflation  @xcite , scale - invariant fluctuations without inflation  @xcite , and possible dark energy scenario @xcite .",
    "there are also some discussion closely related to observational cosmology and astrophysics such as cosmological perturbation  @xcite , observational constraints  @xcite , primordial magnetic field without inflation  @xcite , and a relativistic star  @xcite .",
    "though the viability of hl gravity is still under intense debate @xcite , we give the theory the benefit of the doubt and will furthermore pursue consequences of hoava s intriguing idea .    here",
    "we focus on the dynamics of friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe in hl gravity , which may provide us new aspect of the early universe .",
    "we study the flrw spacetime with _ non - zero _ spatial curvature in the context of hl gravity .",
    "the non - trivial cosmological evolution is brought by the various terms in the potential which are constructed from the spatial curvature @xmath8 . in particular , we find non - singular behavior in high curvature region , which may lead to avoidance of a big bang initial singularity @xcite .",
    "consequently , many studies on the dynamics of the flrw universe in hl gravity come out within the last few years @xcite .    in the original hl gravity , the so - called detailed balance condition is assumed .",
    "however , this condition can be loosened to have arbitrary coupling constants @xcite .",
    "hence both models have been so far discussed in the analysis of the flrw universe . as for matter components ,",
    "a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath9 and a scalar field have been discussed . as a result",
    ", we can classify the analyzed models into four types : ( 1 ) the model with the detailed balance condition and with a perfect fluid  @xcite , ( 2 ) the model with the detailed balance condition and with a scalar field  @xcite ( 3 ) the model without the detailed balance condition and with a perfect fluid  @xcite , and ( 4 ) the model without the detailed balance condition and with a scalar field  @xcite .",
    "so far many works have been done assuming the detailed balance condition , and they reveal the possibility of singularity avoidance such as a bounce universe @xcite and an oscillating spacetime @xcite .",
    "the initial singularity is avoided because of  dark \" radiation , which is a negative @xmath10 term .",
    "it comes from higher curvature terms .",
    "the  dark \" radiation was first introduced in the context of a brane world  @xcite .",
    "although such an effect is very interesting and important , the  dark \" radiation term may fail to avoid a singularity if one include radiation or massless field .",
    "the conventional radiation behaves as @xmath10 with positive coefficient .",
    "if we have a sufficient amount of real radiation , the universe will inevitably collapse to a big - crunch singularity . furthermore , if we assume that radiation field has also the same scaling law as gravity in the uv limit , the energy density of radiation field changes as @xmath11@xcite , which is the same scaling law of stiff matter in the conventional theory .",
    "inclusion of the positive @xmath12 term will kill the possibility of singularity avoidance by  dark \" radiation . in order to save the present mechanism for singularity avoidance",
    ", one needs a negative @xmath12 term , which may be obtained in the generalized hl gravity model @xcite .",
    "recently some papers have discussed the case without the detailed balance and studied a singularity avoidance ( a bounce universe or an oscillating behavior ) : one is by use of a phase space analysis @xcite , and the other is the case with perfect fluid with time - evolving equation of state  @xcite .",
    "the former analysis was not properly performed because they introduce the dynamical variables more than the degrees of freedom . in the latter case , although they discuss some interesting transitions , the assumption of the equation of state is not so clear .    in the present paper ,",
    "since there has so far not been a systematic and substantial analysis in cosmology based on this most general potential without the detailed balance condition , we provide a complete classification of the cosmological dynamics .",
    "we do not include any matter fields not only for simplicity but also to avoid unclear assumption .",
    "it is just straightforward to include perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath13 ( @xmath14=constant ) .",
    "in particular , our analysis includes matter fluid with radiation and stiff matter as it is .",
    "we clarify which conditions should be satisfied for singularity avoidance .",
    "we also propose some possible scenario for a cyclic universe , i.e. , the oscillating spacetime will transit by quantum tunneling to an inflationary phase , resulting in a cyclic universe after reheating .    the paper is organized as follows . after giving the generalized model of hoava - lifshitz gravity in  .[horava - lifshitz ] , we study the isotropic and homogeneous vacuum spacetime in ",
    "we find a variety of phase structures including a bounce universe and an oscillating universe .",
    "we then invoke a more realistic cosmological model which may lead to a macroscopic cyclic universe via quantum tunneling from an oscillating universe .",
    "the basic variables in hl gravity are the lapse function , @xmath15 , the shift vector , @xmath16 , and the spatial metric , @xmath17 .",
    "these variables are subject to the action  @xcite @xmath18 \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and the kinetic term is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 being the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the potential term @xmath22 will be defined shortly . in general relativity",
    "we have @xmath23 , only for which the kinetic term is invariant under general coordinate transformations . in hl gravity , however , lorentz symmetry is broken in exchange for renormalizability and the symmetry of the theory is invariance under the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism transformations , @xmath24    as implied by the symmetry ( @xmath25 ) it is most natural to consider the projectable version of hl gravity , for which the lapse function is dependent only on @xmath26 : @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian constraint is derived from the variation with respect to the lapse function , in the projectable version of the theory the resultant constraint equation is not imposed locally at each point in space , but rather is an integration over the whole space . in the cosmological",
    "setting , the projectability condition results in an additional dust - like component in the friedmann equation [ see eq .",
    "( [ friedmann_eq ] ) below ]  @xcite .",
    "the most general form of the potential @xmath22 is given by  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath1 is a cosmological constant , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ricci and scalar curvatures of the 3-metric @xmath17 , respectively , and @xmath31 s ( @xmath32 ) are the dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "( see appendix a for some conditions on these coupling constants . )    in the original proposal  @xcite hoava assumed the detailed balance condition , by which the potential term  ( [ potential ] ) is simplified to some extent .",
    "the potential under the detailed balance condition is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cotton tensor , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants .",
    "the potential  ( [ db - pot ] ) is therefore reproduced by identifying @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in the detailed balance case @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "are two free parameters .    in what follows",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath40 for brevity .",
    "we discuss an isotropic and homogeneous vacuum universe in hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "note that such a vacuum spacetime is not realized in general relativity .",
    "we will extend our analysis to anisotropic spacetime ( bianchi cosmology ) in the separate paper .    assuming a flrw spacetime , which metric is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "we find the friedmann equation as    @xmath44 \\label{friedmann_eq } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 a constant @xmath47 may appear from the projectability condition and could be  dark matter\"@xcite .",
    "for a flat universe ( @xmath42 ) , the higher curvature terms do not give any contribution , and then the dynamics is almost trivial .",
    "hence , in this paper , we discuss only non - flat universe ( @xmath48 ) .    if @xmath23 , we find a usual friedmann equation for an isotropic and homogeneous universe in gr with a cosmological constant , dust , radiation and stiff matter .",
    "if @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are non - negative , such a spacetime gives a conventional flrw universe model .",
    "however , since those coefficients come from higher curvature terms , their positivity is not guaranteed .",
    "rather some of them could be negative . as a result",
    ", we find an unconventional cosmological scenario , which we shall discuss here . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that @xmath51 , but do not fix it to be unity .    in this paper , we assume @xmath52 just for simplicity .",

    "note that in the case with the detailed balance condition , we have @xmath59 it is some special case of our analysis , although its dynamics will be completely different from generic cases because @xmath50 vanishes .",

    "after tunneling , the potential of the scalar field will behaves as a cosmological constant in a slow - rolling period .",
    "we will find an exponential expansion of the universe after tunneling .",
    "however , inflation will eventually end and the energy of the scalar field is converted to that of conventional matter fluid via a reheating of the universe .",
    "we find a big bang universe .",
    "since the universe is closed , but the scale factor has lower bound because of negative  stiff matter \" , we will find a macroscopically large cyclic universe after all . to confirm such a scenario",

    "the dispersion relation for the longitudinal mode turns out to be  @xcite @xmath321 we see that the sound speed squared is negative in the ir if @xmath322 and @xmath323 , which implies that the longitudinal graviton is unstable in the ir  @xcite .",
    "however , this fact itself does not necessarily mean that the theory suffers from pathologies , because whether or not an instability really causes a trouble depends upon its time scale  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is an attempt to improve the behavior of the longitudinal graviton by promoting @xmath15 to an @xmath324-dependent function and adding terms constructed from the 3-vector @xmath325 in the lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the non - projectable hoava gravity thus extended appropriately does not plagued with instabilities of the longitudinal gravitons  @xcite . in light of these subtleties , we do not consider the stability of the longitudinal sector furthermore , while we do require the stability for the usual helicity-2 polarizations of the graviton .",
