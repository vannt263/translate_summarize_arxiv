    "clusters of galaxies have been widely used to provide useful constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , henry & arnaud 1991 ; bahcall & fan 1998 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ; borgani et al .  2001 ) .",
    "this is in part possible because there is a well - developed theoretical framework which allows one to predict the mass function ( mf ) of clusters of galaxies and its evolution as a function of the cosmology . here",
    ", the mf is defined as the number density of clusters as a function of their mass .",
    "one standard method for predicting the mf is to use press - schechter formalism , originally developed by press & schechter ( 1974 , hereafter ps ) , and developed in more detail by bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , among others , in combination with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model . in hierarchical structure formation models like cdm , more massive halos form from the merger of smaller halos .",
    "values of cosmological parameters can be estimated by comparing theoretical models for the mf of clusters with observations .",
    "this technique places the strongest constraints on @xmath0 , the rms mass fluctuations on a scale of @xmath10 mpc where @xmath11 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath12 km / sec / mpc , and on @xmath13 , the ratio of the current mean matter density to the critical density @xmath14 at the current epoch ( e.g. , henry & arnaud 1991 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ; eke et al .",
    "1998 ; borgani et al .  2001 ; ikebe et al .  2002 ) . roughly speaking",
    ", the present - day abundance of clusters determines the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath15 , while the evolution of clustering with redshift breaks this degeneracy , although reiprich & bhringer ( 2001 ) have been able to constrain @xmath15 using only a local cluster sample by assuming a cdm spectrum of perturbations whose shape parameter depends on @xmath15 . in these determinations ,",
    "the most massive clusters have the greatest leverage .",
    "massive clusters are rare objects , and the abundance of the most massive clusters is very sensitive to the cosmological parameters .    unfortunately , the mf of clusters of galaxies can not be directly observed ( save by gravitational lensing in a relatively small number of cases ) .",
    "generally , it is inferred from the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) or temperature function ( tf ) , using empirical or semi - empirical relations between the masses of clusters and their temperatures ( @xmath16 ) or x - ray luminosities ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these scaling relations are usually applied under the assumption that the clusters are dynamically relaxed , although in reality this can not always be true since in the cdm model larger clusters are continually forming via mergers of smaller clusters .",
    "simulations have shown that if two clusters of comparable mass merge to form a larger cluster , there is a temporary increase in the cluster s x - ray luminosity and temperature ( ricker & sarazin 2001 ; ritchie & thomas 2002 ) . if the cluster is observed during this period of boosted luminosity and temperature , the inferred mass will be larger than the actual mass of the cluster .",
    "in fact , such objects will be preferentially detected in x - ray flux - limited samples because they are intrinsically more luminous than equal mass clusters which are not currently experiencing a merger .",
    "this will be particularly true for x - ray selected , high redshift clusters . as a possible examples of this , one of the most distant x - ray selected clusters observed to date , rxj1053.7 + 5735 , has a morphology which may indicate an ongoing merger ( hashimoto et al .",
    "2002 ) , as does the most luminous x - ray selected cluster found to date , rxj1347.5 - 1145 ( allen , schmidt , & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "if this x - ray luminosity - temperature ( hereafter l - t ) boost effect is sufficiently large , and if mergers occur frequently enough , then the observed xlf and tf , and hence the inferred mf , will be different from what they would be if all clusters were dynamically relaxed .",
    "one would expect that merger boosts would affect most strongly the high luminosity and temperature ends of the xlf and tf .",
    "since the massive clusters which have very high values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 are rare , a small contribution of lower mass clusters with l - t boosts could strongly affect the statistics . as we noted above",
    ", the abundance of the hottest and most luminous clusters ( which are usually assumed to be the most massive clusters ) has a strong influence on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , if merger boosts artificially increase the abundance of hot , luminous clusters at high redshift , the real value of @xmath15 will be underestimated . since observations of the numbers of high temperature and luminosity clusters at moderate and high redshifts have been used to infer that @xmath15 is low ( e.g. , bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; borgani et al .",
    "2001 ) , this effect could be important .",
    "in this paper we attempt to quantify the effect of mergers on the observed xlf and tf , and to determine how the x - ray l - t boost associated with mergers alters the values of @xmath0 and @xmath15 inferred from observations .",
    "we consider three possible cosmologies : an `` open '' model ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , a `` flat '' model ( @xmath20 ) , and an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) model ( @xmath21 , @xmath19 ) . here , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the cosmological constant .",
    "we use extended press - schechter ( eps ) theory (   [ sec : basic_ps ] ) and a monte carlo technique to build a collection of merger histories of clusters ( `` merger trees , '' ",
    "[ sec : trees ] ) for a variety of cosmologies .",
    "we then build two sets of xlfs and tfs from the mf given by the merger trees for each cosmology by averaging together many merger trees (   [ sec : xlf+tf ] ) .",
    "one set assumes that clusters are always relaxed when transforming from mass to temperature or luminosity (    [ sec : m - t+m - l ] , [ sec : no_boosts ] ) , while the other set includes the l - t boost effect (   [ sec : with_boosts ] ) .",
    "we ignore such non - gravitational effects as preheating since such effects are mainly important for lower mass clusters and groups ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) , whereas we choose to focus on massive clusters where the effects of merger boosts are most important .",
    "we also ignore cooling flows at the centers of clusters , which may be disrupted by mergers .",
    "the disruption of cooling flows may increase the effect of mergers on x - ray temperatures , but decrease their effect on x - ray luminosities .",
    "the strength and duration of the l - t boost is estimated for arbitrary merging masses and impact parameters by interpolating and extrapolating from the results of a series of n - body / hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers (   [ sec : hydro ] and appendix  b ) .",
    "the angular momenta or impact parameters for the mergers are drawn from a distribution based on linear theory (   [ sec : impact_param ] ) .",
    "the boosted xlfs and tfs are presented in ",
    "[ sec : xlf+tf ] at a variety of redshifts , and are compared to unboosted results .",
    "the boosted and unboosted xlfs and tfs at several redshifts are fitted using a ps mass function and equilibrium relations between the mass and temperature or x - ray luminosity (   [ sec : tree_fit ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters , specifically @xmath0 and @xmath15 , are compared to the `` actual '' parameters used to build the trees .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   [",
    "sec : discuss ] .",
    "the quantity which is given most directly by theory is the mf of clusters , @xmath24 , which is defined such that @xmath25 gives the number of clusters per unit comoving volume with masses in the range @xmath26 .",
    "the mf of clusters at various redshifts and for various cosmologies can be derived from numerical simulations of clustering , or from semi - analytic techniques .",
    "since we wish to compare the effects of merger boosts on the properties of an otherwise identical ensemble of clusters in several cosmologies , it is easier to use the semi - analytical techniques .",
    "a simple expression for the mass function of clusters is given by ps formalism .",
    "comparisons to observations of clusters and to numerical simulations show that ps provides a good representation of the statistical properties of clusters , if the ps parameters are carefully selected ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) . based on large n - body simulations ,",
    "some authors have suggested other forms for the mass function of dark matter halos which differ somewhat from the ps predictions ( e.g. , sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et al .",
    "since we are mainly interested in determining the relative effects of merger boosts on the xlf and tf , the exact form of the distribution function we assume should be unimportant , just so long as the same model is used both when including the effects of merger boosts and when ignoring them .",
    "ps formalism assumes that galaxies and clusters grow by the gravitational instability of initially small amplitude gaussian density fluctuations generated by some process in the early universe .",
    "the fluctuation spectrum is assumed to have larger amplitudes on smaller scales .",
    "thus , galaxies and clusters form hierarchically , with lower mass objects ( galaxies and groups of galaxies ) forming before larger clusters .",
    "these smaller objects then merge to form clusters .    according to ps",

    "the initial spectrum of fluctuations can be calculated for various cosmologies ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . over the range of scales covered by clusters ,",
    "it is generally sufficient to consider a power - law spectrum of density perturbations , which is consistent with these cdm models : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the present day rms density fluctuation on a scale of 8 @xmath35 mpc , and @xmath36 is the mass contained in a sphere of radius 8 @xmath35 mpc .",
    "the exponent @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 , where the power spectrum of fluctuations varies with wavenumber @xmath39 as @xmath40 ; following bahcall & fan ( 1998 ) , we assume @xmath41 , which leads to @xmath42 throughout .",
    "the normalization of the power spectrum and overall present - day abundance of clusters is set by @xmath0 .",
    "the observed present - day abundance of clusters leads to @xmath43 ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "we determine the value of @xmath0 by requiring that our models reproduce the observed local number density of clusters with temperature @xmath44 kev , which we take to be @xmath45 mpc@xmath46 kev@xmath7 ( henry & arnaud 1991 ) , although some more recent observations suggest a slightly smaller value for the local number density of clusters at @xmath44 kev ( ikebe et al .",
    "we assume a value of @xmath47 km / sec / mpc , since the results scale in a simple way with the hubble constant .",
    "we find @xmath48 for the open , flat , and eds models , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the density of clusters is encapsulated in the critical over - density @xmath31 in equation  ( [ eq : psdensity ] ) .",
    "the expressions used for @xmath49 for the three cosmologies under consideration are given in appendix  [ ap : delta ] .",
    "one can determine the merger histories of clusters either moving forward in time ( starting at high redshift and following the merger history of a set of subclusters ) or moving backward in time ( starting at present with a set of clusters , and de - merging them into subclusters ) .",
    "we follow the latter approach .",
    "this has several advantages .",
    "first of all , the initial populations of clusters is set at the present time , where we have the best observational data on the population of clusters .",
    "secondly , one can start with rich clusters at present , and we do nt need to follow the evolution of low mass systems .",
    "if the merger histories are computed going forward in time , one needs to follow the histories of a large ensemble of small systems , most of which never merge into rich clusters .",
    "since rich clusters are rare objects , this is quite inefficient .    to generate our merger trees ,",
    "we follow the eps method outlined by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) .",
    "we begin by writing down the conditional probability that a `` parent '' cluster of mass @xmath50 at a time @xmath51 had a progenitor of mass in the range @xmath52 at some earlier time @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 dm_1 \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with similar definitions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "details of the eps theory and derivations of equation  ( [ eq : eps_prob ] ) are given elsewhere ( see lacey & cole 1993 ; cohn , bagla , & white 2001 ) .",
    "as noted by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , the eps expressions are simplified if we replace the mass @xmath30 and time @xmath61 ( or redshift @xmath32 ) with the variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note that @xmath64 decreases as the mass @xmath30 increases , and that @xmath65 decreases with increasing cosmic time @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the probability that a cluster had a progenitor with a mass corresponding to a change in @xmath64 of @xmath67 in the range @xmath68 at an earlier time corresponding to @xmath69 .",
    "then , equation  ( [ eq : eps_prob ] ) becomes @xmath70 d \\delta s \\ , .\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "as the mass of the progenitors is decreased ( @xmath72 ) , the total number of progenitors diverges . on the other hand ,",
    "the total mass associated with these progenitors converges ( equation  [ eq : eps_prob ] ) .",
    "thus , it is useful to consider only progenitors with masses exceeding some minimum value @xmath73",
    ". mergers involving smaller masses are considered to be part of a continuous accretion process . in our merger trees , the masses of clusters",
    "increase continuously with cosmic time as a result of this accretion process ( or decrease as we run the merger trees backwards in time ) .",
    "however , we do not follow the individual histories of subclusters with masses @xmath74 .",
    "we chose the value of @xmath75 .",
    "we employ a monte carlo technique to construct merger trees .",
    "each tree starts with a cluster with an initial mass @xmath76 .",
    "we step each cluster back in time , using a small but finite time step corresponding to a positive increase @xmath77 .",
    "we adaptively change the step size of @xmath77 as we run the trees backward in time by satisfying the criterion specified by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) that @xmath78 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the cluster at the current time step and @xmath79 is the smallest subcluster we wish to resolve individually .",
    "specifically , at every step we choose a step size equal to half this maximum value .",
    "we found that using a smaller timestep equal to 1/10 of this maximum value did not significantly alter our results .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution of subcluster masses is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the complementary error function .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution is defined such that @xmath82 as @xmath83 . to draw a @xmath84 from this probability distribution , we select a uniformly - distributed random number @xmath85 between 0 and 1 , and determine the corresponding value of @xmath84 by solving numerically the equation @xmath86 .",
    "the value of @xmath87 of the progenitor is then @xmath88 . the mass of one of the progenitors is given by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is given by equation  ( [ eq : sigma ] ) .",
    "the mass of the other progenitor is @xmath91 .",
    "let @xmath92 and @xmath93 . if @xmath94 , we consider the change in mass to @xmath50 to be due to accretion ( i.e. , to a very small merger or mergers ) .",
    "the transitory effects of such a small merger or mergers are assumed to be small .",
    "we reduce the mass of the cluster to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 becomes the new value of @xmath50 for the next timestep in the merger tree .",
    "we do not follow the smaller mass @xmath97 as a separate subcluster . however , if @xmath98 , we say that a merger has occurred and we follow both of the merging subclusters of masses @xmath99 and @xmath100 separately",
    ". we continue this process until either the branch we are following drops below a mass of @xmath73 or we reach the maximum redshift @xmath101 we wish to study .",
    "we choose to run each tree back to a fixed mass limit , as opposed to a limit expressed as some fraction of the final mass @xmath76 , so that the mass completeness limit of the cluster sample at all redshifts can be readily determined .",
    "an example of a merger tree generated in this way is shown in figure [ fig : merger_tree ] .    as pointed out by somerville & kolatt ( 1999 , hereafter sk )",
    ", there are some inherent problems with generating merger trees in this way .",
    "first of all , this technique allows for binary mergers only , while in reality multiple nearly simultaneous mergers are possible .",
    "sk showed that allowing for multiple mergers improves the agreement between monte carlo merger trees and ps theory predictions for the mass function .",
    "however , such multiple mergers mainly affect the relatively low mass halos at rather high redshifts @xmath102",
    ". since we are mainly interested in massive clusters and will only follow the merger trees out to @xmath103 , this is not such a significant problem here .    another related problem with the binary merger tree method ,",
    "also pointed out by sk , is that while we draw one merging halo mass @xmath100 from equation  ( [ eq : int_prob ] ) , the mass of the other merging halo @xmath99 is simply taken to be the mass of the progenitor @xmath50 minus @xmath100 .",
    "while this approach ensures mass conservation , it distorts the distribution function we are actually drawing halo masses from in a complicated way , such that the effective distribution is no longer described by equation  ( [ eq : int_prob ] ) .",
    "the solution is to continue to draw merging halo masses from equation  ( [ eq : int_prob ] ) with the restriction that the sum of the halo masses does not exceed the mass of the progenitor ( see sk ) .",
    "this requires that we allow multiple merger events .",
    "the main reason we have not implemented this n - branch tree method developed by sk is that it is unclear how to determine the luminosity and temperature boosts associated with a multiple merger event given the simulation data available (   [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "however , it is likely that the effects of multiple mergers with smaller subclusters will be less important than major binary merger events with @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , we find that the predictions of our binary merger tree method agree reasonably well with ps theory over the range of redshifts and halo masses we are interested in ( see   [ sec : tests ] ) .",
    "the previous section describes how we determine the merger history of a cluster with a given mass @xmath76 at the present time . in order to describe the statistical properties of mergers",
    ", we construct an ensemble of such merger trees for a set of present day masses , @xmath105 . in principle , the simplest way to select such initial masses would be to draw them from the ps distribution at the present time , @xmath106 ( equation  [ eq : psdensity ] ) .",
    "then , the properties of the cluster ensemble at any redshift could be derived simply by averaging over all of the clusters in the set of merger trees . however",
    ", the ps mass function diverges at low masses ( although the mass contained in the clusters converges ) .",
    "this means that most of the merger trees selected in this way would follow the histories of rather small clusters . in order to have enough statistics to sample the larger clusters adequately",
    ", one would require a very large number of merger trees .    in order to increase",
    "the efficiency and still have adequate statistics on large clusters , we select the initial ( present day ) cluster masses according to a different distribution function which gives a greater weight to higher mass systems . we draw the values of @xmath105 from the distribution function @xmath107 , which is defined such that @xmath108 is the number of merger trees with initial masses in the range @xmath109 . in practice , we take the initial masses to have logarithmically spaced masses , which corresponds to @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the largest cluster mass considered , and @xmath112 is the total number of trees run .",
    "we construct three separate ensembles of merger trees for the three cosmologies under consideration ( the open , flat , and eds models ) . in each case",
    "we choose @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and a lower limit on the present day mass of clusters considered @xmath115 .",
    "since the method of generating merger trees described above is based on the eps theory , we expect that the mass function produced by the merger trees will agree with the ps function ( equation  [ eq : psdensity ] ) for the same cosmological parameters .",
    "of course , the tree - generated mass functions will be underestimated for masses smaller than @xmath116 , the smallest initial mass for a merger tree . the properly - weighted mass function from our ensemble of merger trees",

    "we could use empirical relations , but these are generally not available at all redshifts .",
    "we prefer relations which have the correct dependence on redshift and on cosmological parameters , since we consider a range of redshifts and a variety of cosmological models . moreover , we prefer a theoretical dependence on the cluster mass rather than an empirical one , since the empirical relations may already be biased by the effects of merger boosts .",
    "it has been shown that the empirical relationship between cluster mass , luminosity , and temperature is somewhat different from what one would expect from theoretical arguments and numerical simulations where only gravitational heating is considered , even at the relatively high temperatures and luminosities we consider in this paper ( e.g. , arnaud & evrard 1999 ; allen , schmidt , & fabian 2001 ; finoguenov , reiprich , & bhringer 2001 ) . at present , the detailed physics and redshift dependence of these non - gravitational effects are not well understood .",
    "as a result we did not include such effects in our simulations .",
    "while it is true that preheating and other non - gravitational effects may slightly dilute the effect of merger boosts since the fractional increase in x - ray luminosity and temperature due to mergers will be smaller if non - gravitational heating is considered , the effect will be most important for low mass clusters ( ponman et al .",

    "once a cluster is virialized , its properties ( including the temperature and luminosity ) are assumed to remain constant within these equilibrium relations .",

    "we assume the relationships given by equations  ( [ eq : m_l ] ) and ( [ eq : m_t ] ) throughout .",
    "however , if a cluster has recently experienced a major merger , it will be in a non - equilibrium state , and we expect its temperature and luminosity to exceed that of a relaxed cluster of equal mass at the same redshift .",

    "in general , this distribution is somewhat skewed ( e.g. kitayama & suto 1996 ) so that convolving it with the ps distribution may produce a different tf from the one obtained if an average formation epoch is assumed .",

    "however , at larger temperatures and luminosities , the boosted xlfs and tfs rise above the unboosted curves .",
    "this is due to the fact that majors mergers with large boosts are relatively rare events .",
    "thus , they do not affect the statistics of clusters unless the virialized clusters with the same temperature and luminosity are themselves extremely rare .",
    "there is an exponential drop - off in the expected number of the most massive clusters ( equation  [ eq : psdensity ] ) , which have the largest virialized temperatures and luminosities .",
    "thus , relatively rare major mergers of smaller and more common clusters can compete with the numbers of these most massive clusters .",
    "table  [ tab : boosts ] gives the fractional increase in the _ cumulative _ luminosity and temperature functions at @xmath237 due to merger boosts for the three cosmologies we consider .",
    "for example , in the flat model at @xmath4 , merger boosts cause the number of clusters with temperatures @xmath5 kev to increase by a factor of 9.49 , and the number of clusters with luminosities @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 is increased by a factor of 8.9 .",
    "the same factors for the eds model at a redshift of @xmath9 are 37.7 and 24.1 for the cumulative temperature and luminosity functions respectively .",
    "we note that the increase in the boosted xlfs and tfs over the unboosted values is largest in the eds model , weakest in the open model , and intermediate in the flat model .",
    "this is to be expected since the evolution of cluster abundance is relatively rapid in the eds model , less rapid in the flat model , and least rapid in the open model .",
    "this means that at low redshifts , the merger rate must be highest in the eds model and lowest in the open model .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the cluster abundance is so rapid in the eds model that the higher temperature and luminosity clusters have essentially disappeared by a redshift of one . for this reason ,",
    "we adapt lower temperature and luminosity limits for the eds model at @xmath4 in table  [ tab : boosts ] .",
    "it should be noted that at the highest temperatures and luminosities the merger tree predictions are uncertain for non - zero redshifts since there are fewer and fewer hot luminous clusters at larger and larger redshifts , so that the statistics in the high end bins are poor .",
    "this effect is most noticeable in the eds model where cluster abundance evolution occurs most rapidly so that high mass , high redshift objects are especially rare .",
    "for example , the large discrepancy at @xmath238 kev and @xmath4 between the boosted and unboosted tfs for the eds model seen in figure  [ fig : dndt_tree ] is not a real effect but an artifact of the lack of high temperature clusters at this redshift .",
    "note that merger boosts cause @xmath239 kev clusters at @xmath240 in an eds model to be almost as common as in the flat model .",
    "thus , if all of the cosmological parameters other than @xmath1 were known from other measurements , and the abundance of very hot or very x - ray luminous clusters at high redshift were used to determine @xmath1 , the value would be substantially underestimated .",
    "we now treat the binned xlfs and tfs generated from the merger trees as we would observational data , fitting the data with equations  ( [ eq : dndt ] ) and ( [ eq : dndl ] ) and treating @xmath1 and @xmath0 as free parameters of the fit .",
    "the models are fit using least squares fitting , where we choose to minimize the square of the difference of the logs of the ps and merger tree tfs and xlfs so that more weight is given to hot , luminous clusters .",
    "if we only consider observations at one redshift , there is a degeneracy between the fitting parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , such that @xmath241 ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ) . one way to break this degeneracy is to simultaneously fit data at two or more redshifts . for each of the three cosmologies under consideration",
    ", we have simultaneously fit the tfs and xlfs at @xmath8 and at either @xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "this corresponds to the typical procedure of using observations of a low redshift cluster sample to determine the local tf or xlf ( and possibly infer the mass function ) , and then comparing to a higher redshift sample .",
    "the merger boosted tfs and xlfs for the models are shown in figures  [ fig : dndt_fit ] and  [ fig : dldt_fit ] along with best - fit ps models .",
    "the best - fit parameters found in fitting equations  ( [ eq : dndt ] ) & ( [ eq : dndl ] ) to the boosted and unboosted temperature and luminosity functions of the merger trees are given in tables  [ tab : temp_fit ] & [ tab : lum_fit ] .",
    "for comparison , the actual values of the parameters used to build the merger trees are also given in these tables .",
    "if we compare the values given for @xmath0 from the boosted tfs and xlfs to those given by the unboosted functions we see that , in general , merger boosts cause @xmath0 to be overestimated by about 20% ( except for the open model xlf , which only shows a 5% increase ) .",
    "similarly , if we compare the values of @xmath0 from the unboosted tfs to the values actually used to construct the trees , we find that they are about 10% larger .",
    "the same comparison for the xlf results also show that @xmath0 is larger than the original values used to build the merger trees , but there is a lot of scatter in the magnitude of the increase .",
    "the unboosted @xmath0 values are systematically higher than the original values because the merger tree tfs and xlfs lie slightly above the curves given by equations  ( [ eq : dndt ] ) & ( [ eq : dndl ] ) with the original values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : no_boosts ] , this has to do with the fact that the formation times must be estimated when using equation  ( [ eq : dndt ] ) , whereas for the merger trees we have a record of the formation time for each cluster .",
    "a similar set of comparisons shows that , in the case of the tfs , merger boosts cause @xmath1 to be underestimated by about 20% , while the unboosted values for @xmath1 are smaller than the actual values used to build the merger trees by about 15% .",
    "the xlf results for @xmath1 show large variations and no systematic trends .",
    "thus , while the results from the tfs suggest that merger boosts can cause @xmath1 to be underestimated by about 20% , the results from the xlfs are less conclusive .    it should be noted that the effect of merger boosts on @xmath0 and @xmath1 depends somewhat on the detailed method used to determine the tfs and xlfs and the criteria used to fit them .",
    "thus , the results given here should be viewed as an illustration .",
    "since the merger boost effect is greatest for the highest temperatures and luminosities , the effect on @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be greatest for samples of hot , luminous clusters , or for fitting techniques that weight these clusters more highly .    while much of the work done to date on using the xlf and tf of clusters to constrain both @xmath1 and @xmath0 has used the evolution of these functions to break the degeneracy between them , it should be noted that some recent studies simultaneously determine these two parameters using only the shape of the local mass function of clusters ( e.g. , reiprich & bhringer 2001 ) .",
    "this study relies on the predicted variation of the fluctuation spectrum with @xmath1 in cdm models .",
    "since we assume a power - law fluctuation spectrum , we can not compare directly to the results of reiprich & bhringer ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , we did perform a series of fits using only the local @xmath8 data from the merger trees to determine the relative effects of merger boosts on the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "the results are consistent with the results obtained by simultaneously fitting local and higher redshift merger tree data as discussed above .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers have shown that mergers can temporarily boost the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the merged cluster beyond their virial equilibrium values .",
    "these merger boosts can alter the observed tfs and xlfs of clusters , particularly at the high ends .",
    "even a few `` extra '' clusters with high luminosities and temperatures can have a significant impact due to the relative rarity of massive clusters .",
    "the mass function of clusters is commonly inferred from the observed tf or xlf , assuming virial equilibrium .",
    "the inferred mass function is often used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , merger boosts can affect the inferred cosmological parameters .",
    "we tested the amplitude of the merger boost effect by using eps theory and a monte carlo technique to numerically reconstruct the merger histories ( trees ) of a population of clusters . at each merger",
    ", we quantified the strength of the merger boost by extrapolating or interpolating from a set of hydrodynamical simulations of cluster mergers .",
    "we then built tfs and xlfs from the merger trees , averaging together our sets of merger histories so that the sample cluster population was representative of the observed present day population .",
    "our results show that merger boosts do indeed affect the apparent number of high mass clusters .",
    "for example , in the flat model at @xmath4 merger boosts cause the number of clusters with temperatures @xmath5 kev to increase by a factor of 9.5 , and the number of clusters with luminosities @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 is increased by a factor of 8.9 .",
    "the effect is strongest for an eds model , since clusters evolve more rapidly in this model than in the open and flat models . in the eds model at a redshift of @xmath9 , the number of clusters with temperatures @xmath5 kev is increased by a factor of 38 , and the number with luminosities @xmath244 erg s@xmath7 by a factor of 24 . at first",
    "this might appear contradictory with the fact that the x - ray luminosity receives a larger boost from mergers than the x - ray temperature ( see figure  [ fig : lttt ] ) .",
    "however , the range of x - ray luminosities is larger than the range of x - ray temperatures ; another way of saying this is that the x - ray luminosity - temperature relationship is much steeper than linear . at a result ,",
    "the overall effect of luminosity boosts on the xlf is not as strong as the effect of temperature boosts on the tf .    comparing the boosted and unboosted",
    "differential tf for the eds and flat models at @xmath4 shows that merger boosts cause @xmath239 kev clusters to be almost as common in the eds model as in the flat model .",
    "this means that if all cosmological parameters other than @xmath1 were known from other measurements , and the abundance of very hot or very x - ray luminous clusters at high redshift were used to determine @xmath1 , the value would be substantially underestimated .",
    "we fit ps distributions to our simulated tfs and xlfs .",
    "we did this by considering two samples : a low redshift , local sample ( @xmath245 ) , and a moderate or high redshift sample ( @xmath246 or @xmath240 ) .",
    "the two samples are fit simultaneously to determine the best - fit values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and these values were compared to the actual values used to construct the merger trees .",
    "merger boosts can cause @xmath0 to be overestimated by about 20% .",
    "merger boosts may also cause @xmath1 to be underestimated by about 20% , although the results from the xlf fits do not show a clear trend .",
    "the effect of merger boosts on the inferred value of @xmath1 is much smaller in these fits than might have been expected from the overall increase in the number of hot clusters at high redshifts produced by merger boosts .",
    "much of the effect of merger boost is `` renormalized '' away by the joint fit of low and high redshift sample .",
    "one way to think of this is that merger boosts increase the numbers of hot clusters , both at low redshift and high redshift .",
    "determining @xmath0 from the low redshift sample or from a joint fit removes much of the boost effect , and the change in @xmath1 is smaller than one might have expected .",
    "studies of the abundance of hot or luminous clusters at high redshift have been used to argue that we live in a low density universe ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ; borgani et al .",
    "it would appear that merger boosts do not invalidate this conclusion , although the error bars should be increased significantly to include the systematic uncertainties associated with merger boosts .",
    "on the other hand , merger boosts do affect the value of @xmath0 .",
    "as noted before , the number of the hottest and most luminous clusters are affected quite strongly .",
    "thus , any comparison between cluster tfs and xlfs and cosmological parameters derived from other objects ( from cosmic microwave background radiation fluctuations , or from the brightness of distant supernovae ) is likely to be inconsistent and may lead to errors in the deduced cosmological parameters . at the least ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties are likely to be much larger than might be inferred from the statistics of clusters alone .",
    "obviously , the effect of merger boosts could be avoided entirely if the mass function could be determined directly from gravitational lensing observations .",
    "radio detections of the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect can also provide a measure of the number of luminous and hot clusters , particularly at high redshift ( e.g. , holder et al .",
