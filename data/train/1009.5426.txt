    "a substantial literature has been developed over the last forty years that recognizes the simplifications that arise in the analysis of queueing systems in the presence of `` heavy traffic . ''",
    "the earliest such `` heavy traffic '' approximation was that obtained by @xcite ( @xcite ) for the steady - state waiting time @xmath0 for the g / g/1 queue .",
    "in particular , let @xmath4 be the waiting time ( exclusive of service ) of the @xmath5th customer for a first - in first - out ( fifo ) single - server queue ( with an infinite capacity waiting room ) fed by a renewal arrival process [ with i.i.d .",
    "inter - arrival times @xmath6 and an independent stream of i.i.d .",
    "processing times @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , then @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath0 can be approximated via @xmath11 when @xmath1 is close to 1 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is an exponential r.v . with mean one and",
    "@xmath13 denotes `` has approximately the same distribution as . ''",
    "a precise statement of the limit theorem supporting the heavy traffic approximation ( [ eq : htrafficapprox ] ) is given by ( [ eq : htrafficconvergence ] ) below .",
    "the term `` heavy traffic '' arises as a consequence of the fact that long queues tend to form when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are roughly balanced .",
    "the modern approach to justifying ( [ eq : htrafficapprox ] ) involves first showing that @xmath16 can be approximated in heavy traffic by a one - dimensional reflecting brownian motion ( rbm ) [ see , e.g. , @xcite ( @xcite ) ] and then verifying that the steady - state r.v . @xmath0 can be approximated by that of the rbm [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "similar methods apply , in significant generality , to multi - station queueing networks .",
    "for example , @xcite proves a functional limit theorem that justifies approximating a single class multi - station queueing network by multi - dimensional rbm .",
    "recent work of @xcite establishes the associated steady - state convergence . @xcite",
    "analyze the multi - dimensional rbm and show that it has exponential tails .",
    "on the other hand , if the processing times are heavy - tailed ( e.g. , regularly varying ) , there is a significant literature that establishes , for various models , that the associated queueing system possesses a heavy - tailed steady - state . a representative result of this type states that when @xmath17 for the g / g/1 fifo queue described above ( with regularly varying processing times ) , we have @xmath18 as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "corresponding heavy - tailed steady - state asymptotics also exist in the context of queueing networks [ see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ] .    at first",
    ", it may seem contradictory that the heavy - traffic theory typically predicts exponential tails for the steady - state distribution , whereas regularly varying heavy - tailed asymptotics predict power - law decay in the steady - state tail . of course , the key is to note that the two families of results involve different types of limits , one as @xmath21 ( heavy traffic ) and the other as @xmath19 ( heavy tails ) .",
    "the interesting mathematical issue here is therefore to send @xmath1 to 1 and @xmath19 simultaneously , and to determine the @xmath22-value ( as a function of @xmath1 ) at which the steady - state distribution begins to `` feel '' the presence of the heavy tails in the processing times . in particular",
    ", this paper develops a very explicit description , in the setting of the m / g/1 queue ( in which the arrival process is assumed poisson ) , of where the transition from the exponential heavy - traffic approximation ( [ eq : htrafficapprox ] ) to the heavy - tailed approximation ( [ eq : htailapprox ] ) occurs . as a corollary to our main results ( corollary [ c.threshold2 ] )",
    "we find that when the processing times are regularly varying , then the tail probability @xmath23 sharply transitions at @xmath24 from the approximation ( [ eq : htrafficapprox ] ) to the approximation ( [ eq : htailapprox ] ) ( where @xmath25 is the tail index of the regularly varying @xmath26 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , to the left of @xmath27 , ( [ eq : htrafficapprox ] ) is valid whereas to the right of @xmath27 , ( [ eq : htailapprox ] ) is appropriate . a companion paper [ olvera - cravioto and glynn ( @xcite ) ] provides uniform approximations for @xmath28 in the general subexponential case , and shows how in the setting of weibullian tails one can identify an intermediate zone in which neither the heavy - traffic asymptotic nor the heavy - tailed asymptotic hold .",
    "this result ties together two significant queueing theory literatures , namely heavy traffic theory and heavy - tailed approximations . as the first such result describing the transition from the heavy traffic regime to the heavy - tailed asymptotic",
    ", it suggests the possibility of similar such results for more complex systems and networks .",
    "furthermore , one of our main results , theorem [ t.sumsapprox ] , provides an approximation for the tail probability @xmath29 that is uniform across all values of @xmath1 , and that in numerical experiments seems to perform very well .",
    "this new uniform approximation , which takes advantage of the pollaczek  khintchine formula for the m / g/1 queue , provides a significant numerical improvement over the existing heavy - traffic and heavy - tail approximations that are commonly used to approximate the tail of the r.v . @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the waiting time sequence for an m / g/1 fifo queue that is fed by a poisson arrival process having arrival rate @xmath31 and independent i.i.d .",
    "processing times @xmath7 .",
    "we assume throughout the remainder of this paper ( unless otherwise noted ) that @xmath26 has a regularly varying distribution with tail index @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 as @xmath19 , where @xmath34 is slowly varying [ see page 412 of @xcite ] .    if @xmath17 , @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where the pollaczek  khintchine formula [ see , e.g. , page 237 of @xcite ] guarantees that @xmath37 here , @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 ) , where the @xmath40 s are i.i.d . with common density @xmath41 .",
    "the heavy - tail result ( [ eq : htailapprox ] ) translates , in the m / g/1 setting , into the asymptotic @xmath42 as @xmath19 .",
    "it is straightforward [ see , e.g. , page 404 of @xcite ] to show that ( [ eq : htailasymptotic ] ) in turn implies that @xmath43 as @xmath19 .",
    "turning next to the heavy traffic limit theorem for @xmath44 [ due to @xcite ] , its precise statement ( in our m / g/1 setting ) is that @xmath45 as @xmath46 , providing theoretical support for the approximation @xmath47 when @xmath1 is close to 1 . to get a sense of the point @xmath48 at which the heavy traffic approximation ( [ eq : htrafficapprox1 ] ) transitions into the heavy - tail approximation ( [ eq : htailasymptotic2 ] ) ,",
    "note that the point @xmath27 at which the exponential ( [ eq : htrafficapprox1 ] ) crosses the power law tail ( [ eq : htailasymptotic2 ] ) must satisfy @xmath49 this implies that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .    to make the above heuristic rigorous we look more closely at the pollaczek  khintchine formula .",
    "first we note that the heavy - tail asymptotic ( [ eq : htailasymptotic ] ) can be obtained by simply substituting @xmath52 by @xmath53 , that is , by using the so - called subexponential asymptotic for @xmath54 .",
    "such asymptotics are typically stated for fixed values of @xmath5 , but can be shown to hold for @xmath10 provided @xmath5 grows slowly enough compared to @xmath22 [ see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ] . in other words , we can obtain the heavy - tail asymptotic from the first terms of ( [ eq : pollkhin ] ) , @xmath55 for some appropriately defined @xmath56 .",
    "this raises the question of whether we can also obtain the heavy - traffic asymptotic directly from ( [ eq : pollkhin ] ) , and the answer is yes . for large @xmath5 ,",
    "say @xmath57 , @xmath58 , so by simply replacing @xmath54 by one we obtain @xmath59}^\\infty ( 1-\\rho)\\rho^n p(s_n > x ) \\approx\\sum_{n= [ x / ex_1]}^\\infty ( 1-\\rho)\\rho^n = \\rho^{[x / ex_1 ] } .\\ ] ] since as @xmath46 , @xmath60 } \\sim e^{-(1-\\rho)x/ ex_1 } = e^{-2(1-\\rho)ev_1 x / ev_1 ^ 2}$ ] , we can recover the heavy - traffic asymptotic from the last terms of ( [ eq : pollkhin ] ) .",
    "this reasoning leads us to the observation that the transition of @xmath29 occurs at the level of the partial sums @xmath54 .",
    "for the regularly varying case , the transition from the subexponential asymptotic @xmath61 to the clt approximation @xmath62 [ or its stable law counterpart when @xmath63 occurs smoothly , which allows us to approximate the pollaczek  khintchine formula directly and obtain an expression that does not require @xmath1 to be close to one .",
    "theorem [ t.sumsapprox ] below describes this ( uniform in @xmath1 ) approximation , and theorem [ t.newmain1 ] gives an equivalent formulation in terms of more familiar asymptotic expressions . as corollaries",
    ", we obtain the result regarding the transition from heavy - traffic to heavy - tail of @xmath29 , both in terms of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath22 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we also point out that similar versions of our results should also hold for the gi / gi/1 case .",
    "the added difficulty lies in the fact that although @xmath44 still has a representation of the form @xmath64 where the @xmath65 s i.i.d regularly varying random variables [ see @xcite , chapter  x.9 ] , the distribution of the @xmath65 s and the geometric parameter @xmath66 are not explicitly known . in particular , both of them depend on @xmath1 , so a uniform in @xmath1 version of theorem [ origbor ] and an asymptotic expression for @xmath67 are required .",
    "such uniform in @xmath1 results have been recently developed in @xcite .",
    "proof techniques very similar to those given here can then be used to obtain the gi / gi/1 equivalents of our results .",

    "<S> two of the most popular approximations for the distribution of the steady - state waiting time , @xmath0 , of the m / g/1 queue are the so - called heavy - traffic approximation and heavy - tailed asymptotic , respectively . if the traffic intensity , @xmath1 , is close to 1 and the processing times have finite variance , the heavy - traffic approximation states that the distribution of @xmath0 is roughly exponential at scale @xmath2 , while the heavy tailed asymptotic describes power law decay in the tail of the distribution of @xmath0 for a fixed traffic intensity . in this paper , we assume a regularly varying processing time distribution and obtain a sharp threshold in terms of the tail value , or equivalently in terms of @xmath3 , that describes the point at which the tail behavior transitions from the heavy - traffic regime to the heavy - tailed asymptotic . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide new approximations that are either uniform in the traffic intensity , or uniform on the positive axis , that avoid the need to use different expressions on the two regions defined by the threshold .    ,    .    </S>"
