    "in this paper we have constructed polynomial chaos expansions to act as surrogate models to a cmg commercial solver used to estimate peak and cumulative gas extraction from a coal seam gas well .",
    "each pce propagates uncertainty in four input variables and builds a surrogate five dimensional response surface .",
    "the polynomial expansion delivers fast evaluations across the entire parameter space . for instance",
    "a pce completes 3000 evaluations in under a second ( on an intel(r ) core(tm ) i7 - 4770 cpu at 3.40ghz ) whereas the commercial solver requires around five minutes per single evaluation .",
    "being able to cheaply evaluate many points across the parameter space provides uncertainty quantification through the generation of summary statistics and empirical probability and cumulative density functions .",
    "in addition analytic global sensitivity analyses can be formulated from pce at negligible additional computational cost .",
    "the success of this process is demonstrated by the low discrepency between the surrogates and original models .",
    "the constructed pces of order six approximate the commercial solver peak gas extraction rate with relative root mean square error of less than @xmath0 and the cumulative gas extraction with a relative root mean square error less than @xmath1 .",
