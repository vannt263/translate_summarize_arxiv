    "a milestone in the theory of the quantum hall effect is the result obtained by thouless _",
    "@xcite concerning the hall conductivity @xmath1 for free electrons in a periodic potential .",
    "their proof showed that @xmath1 is a multiple integer of @xmath0 , if the chemical potential lies in a gap of the hofstadter spectrum @xcite ( gap condition ) .",
    "the result is rather striking , since the coefficient varies strongly with the number of filled bands and with the commensurability factor @xmath2 , which gives the flux of the magnetic field through the periodicity cell @xmath3 .",
    "subsequent works @xcite have shown the generality of the result by evidencing the topological nature of the hall conductivity .",
    "moreover the result has been shown to be valid also in presence of many - body interaction , provided the ground state is not degenerate @xcite    the proof by thouless _",
    "_ makes use of the linear response approximation ( kubo formula ) . to our knowledge all works devoted to this problem use the linear approximation or , equivalently , the adiabatic approximation .",
    "there are few reasons that make the case of _ finite _ electric field an interesting problem .",
    "first , from the experimental point of view it may be interesting to observe the phenomenon when the electric field varies @xcite .",
    "second , the limit of weak periodic potential is in conflict with the limit of small electric field .",
    "it is important to investigate the intermediate situation where the potential is weak in comparison to the landau splitting and comparable to the electrostatic potential .    the present work deals with the problem without using the linear response approximation .",
    "we consider a galilei transformation in order to have the time dependence of the hamiltonian only in the external periodic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian , being periodic both under magnetic and time translations , allows an analysis in terms of bloch functions and floquet eigenstates @xcite .",
    "thus the dynamical problem consists in finding the quasi - periodic solutions of the schrdinger equation ( floquet states ) and their quasi - energies ( floquet energies ) .",
    "it is shown that there is a simple relation between the hall conductivity and the floquet energies associated to the periodic hamiltonian .",
    "floquet energies can be easily obtained by diagonalization the time evolution operator . the average in time over a period of the expectation value of the hamiltonian over floquet states turns out to be a convenient quantity in order to define _ sub - bands _ on the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "a strong electric field complicates the construction of a stationary state , since it induces transitions to energies above the chemical potential .",
    "in fact a spectrum of energy , which satisfies the gap condition in the adiabatic approximation , might appear partially unresolved for finite values of the electric field .",
    "if the gap condition is satisfied , then the hall conductivity is an integer and moreover it is ruled by a diofantine equation @xcite .",
    "these results are valid as sum rules , i.e. in the case where a group of sub - bands cross with each other .    in the adiabatic approximation",
    "there is a simple relation between floquet energies and berry phases .",

    "<S> sub - bands can be introduced by the time average of the expectation value of the hamiltonian on the floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we prove previous results in form of sum rules as , for instance : the topological character of the hall conductivity ( being an integer multiple of @xmath0 ) , the diofantine equation which constrains the hall conductivity by the rational number which measures the flux of the magnetic field through the periodicity cell . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation fixes in a natural way the phase of the wave function over the reduced brillouin zone : thus the topological invariant providing the hall conductivity can be evaluated numerically without ambiguity .    </S>",
