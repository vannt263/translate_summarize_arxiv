    "one of the standard predictions of nonlinear hierarchical structure formation models is the abundance of virialized structures @xcite .",
    "simulations show that this abundance depends on the large scale environment : the ratio of massive to low mass objects is larger in dense regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent measurements in galaxy surveys appear to bear this out : the virial radii of objects in underdense regions are smaller , consistent with their having smaller masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is motivated by the fact that there are currently in the literature three methods for estimating how the mass function of virialized halos depends on the environment which surrounds them .",
    "the first , and perhaps easist to implement , is based on the excursion set approach @xcite .",
    "the second argues that halos which form in , say , voids should be thought of as forming in a less dense background cosmology , so the mass function is that in a universe with @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the third is similar , but notes that to correctly estimate the background cosmology , one must account not only for the lower density in a void , but for the fact the effective hubble constant of the void cosmology is larger than in the background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one way of thinking about the effective hubble constant is that it ensures that the effective cosmology has the same age as the background cosmology .",
    "( the cosmological constant is , of course , constant , but when expressed in units of the critical density in the effective model , it is modified because the critical density depends on the effective hubble constant . ) in section  [ equivalence ] , we use the spherical evolution model to show that the first and third methods are equivalent ( although * ? ? ?",
    "* state otherwise ) , and that both are incompatible with the second method ( which incorrectly ignored the change to the hubble constant ) .",
    "there has been recent interest in the fact that the formation histories of halos of fixed mass depend on their environment @xcite , an effect which is not predicted by the simplest excursion set methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so one might have wondered if this is where the difference between the excursion set approach and one based on the effective cosmology is manifest . in section  [ evolution ]",
    "we show that in this case also , the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "a final section summarizes our results , and speculates that the equivalence we have shown will not survive in models models where the force law has been modified from an inverse square .",
    "the main point of the following calculation is to show explicitly that , at least for cosmologies with no cosmological constant , the environmental dependence of halo abundances can be described using the excursion set approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "namely , one need not worry about the details of the effective cosmology associated with the region surrounding the perturbation ( as do * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is enough to compute an effective growth factor using the spherical collapse model .",
    "although we have phrased our discussion in terms of an @xmath1 background cosmology , it is obviously applicable to arbitrary values of @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis suggests that this remains true when the background cosmology has @xmath3 .    for what follows , it is useful to recall that the age - redshift relation in an @xmath1 cosmology is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hubble constant . in an open universe ,",
    "this relation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 with the convention that @xmath8 , so @xmath9 , and @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "the spherical evolution model describes the evolution of the size @xmath15 of a spherical region in an expanding universe : @xmath16 it provides a parametric relation between the density contrast predicted by linear theory @xmath17 , the nonlinear overdensity @xmath18 , and the infall speeds @xmath19 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath20 is the linear theory growth factor at time @xmath21 , and we will often use the shorthand , @xmath22 .    if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 where @xmath25 where the first expression in each pair is for initially overdense perturbations and the second is for underdense ones .",
    "overdense perturbations eventually collapse , the final collapse being associated with the value @xmath26 , at which time the linear theory density is @xmath27 . in this section ,",
    "we use the subscript 1 to indicate that this value is associated with @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath12 , then only perturbations above some density @xmath28 will collapse , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the hubble constant , and @xmath32 complete collapse is again associated with @xmath26 , and we will write the critical linear density required for collapse as @xmath33.\\ ] ] it happens that @xmath34 depends only weakly on @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath35 , then @xmath36 , and @xmath37 when @xmath38 .",
    "the parametric solution is rather cumbersome .",
    "it happens that the relation between @xmath39 and @xmath18 is rather well approximated by @xmath40 similarly , it is also useful to have an approximation to the exact solution for the linear theory growth factor .",
    "when @xmath41 , then the linear theory growth factor is well approximated by @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 denotes the expansion factor at time @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is given by equation  ( [ omegat ] ) .",
    "this expression is normalized so that @xmath46 if @xmath1 .",
    "suppose we consider the evolution of a spherical underdense region in an @xmath1 universe .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the density in this region .",
    "if we wish to think of this region as being an underdense universe , then the effective value of @xmath48 in this region is smaller than unity for two reasons : first , because the density is lower by a factor of @xmath49 , and second because the region is expanding faster than the background , so it has an effective hubble constant @xmath50 which is larger .    to see what equation  ( [ scmodel ] ) implies for the evolution ,",
    "let @xmath51 denote the density of a small patch respect to the background density ( the subscript unity denotes the fact that this is the overdensity with respect to a background which has critical density : @xmath1 ) .",
    "now , suppose that this patch is surrounded by a region @xmath52 within which the average density is @xmath49 with respect to the true background .",
    "then the smaller patch has overdensity @xmath53 with respect to its local background . if we wish to describe the local environment as has having its own effective cosmological parameters",
    ", then the local value of the hubble constant @xmath50 differs from the global one @xmath54 : @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the expressions in equation  ( [ scmodel ] ) are really the statements that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the peculiar velocity of the shell @xmath52 with respect to the background , had the mass within @xmath52 been smoothly distributed ( we know it is not because the central region has density @xmath51 ) .",
    "now , the local value of @xmath58 within @xmath52 differs from the global value @xmath1",
    "both because @xmath59 and because the different expansion rate means that the local value of the critical density is different : @xmath60 where we have used the fact that @xmath1 .",
    "notice that this relation between @xmath58 and @xmath61 is the same as equation  ( [ uomega ] ) .",
    "in other words , we get the same description for the evolution of the small scale patch if we treat it as having overdensity @xmath51 with respect to the @xmath1 background within which the hubble constant is @xmath54 , as if we describe it with respect to the local cosmological model @xmath58 and @xmath50 , and we rescale our definitions of density and peculiar velocity accordingly .",
    "in addition , using the exact expression for the age of the universe given above , we can see that these definitions also guarantee that @xmath21 is the same in the both the background and the local cosmological model .",
    "if we write the linear theory overdensity associated with @xmath49 as @xmath62 then @xmath63\\nonumber   =   { \\delta_{\\rm c\\omega}\\over \\delta_{\\rm c1 } - \\delta_\\omega }       \\bigl[h(\\theta ) - \\delta_\\omega\\bigr].\\ ] ] the term in square brackets is simply the difference in linear theory values for the background cosmology .",
    "if we think of this as an effective linear theory overdensity in the effective cosmology , then the prefactor is the effective linear theory growth factor .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that , indeed , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the growth factor in the background cosmology , and @xmath66 is the growth factor in the patch , _ at time @xmath21_. this last point is important , as the expansion factor @xmath67 in the patch cosmology is not equal to the expansion factor in the background cosmology . in particular , we know that @xmath68 . for completeness , we note that @xmath69 ( recall that we are in an underdense region ) .    in the following ,",
    "take @xmath70 , so @xmath71 .",
    "the approximate solution  ( [ approx ] ) of the spherical evolution model shows similar behaviour : @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the linear theory value associated with the nonlinear density @xmath74 for @xmath1 .",
    "the final approximation follows from recalling that @xmath75 depends only weakly on cosmology .",
    "comparison with equation  ( [ approx ] ) shows explicitly that the relevant linear theory quantity is the difference between the @xmath1 values for the perturbation and the environment , and this difference must be multiplied by the linear growth factor @xmath66 in the effective cosmology .",
    "now , to estimate the mass function of virialized objects , we are interested in the case when @xmath26 .",
    "the analysis above shows that @xmath76 ; the objects which form in a region of nonlinear density @xmath49 with respect to the background , with corresponding linear overdensity @xmath77 , can either be thought of as forming in an effective @xmath58 cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or as forming in the true @xmath2 background cosmology but with an effective linear theory overdensity which is offset by @xmath77 to account for the surrounding overdensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second description is easier to implement , and follows naturally from the excursion set description . in particular",
    ", the analysis above shows that approaches which do not correctly compute @xmath58 ( e.g. , gottlber et al .",
    "2003 ignore the fact that @xmath78 ) are incompatible with the excursion set approach . in any case , the analysis above suggests that such approaches are ill - motivated .",
    "the previous section showed that the excursion set approach results in the same expressions for the environmental dependence of the present day linear theory growth factor as one derives from thinking of the environment as defining an effective cosmology .",
    "so the question arises as to whether or not the two approaches predict the same evolution .",
    "for example , one might have wondered if the formation histories of objects are the same in these two approaches .    to see that they are",
    ", it will be convenient to modify our notation slightly .",
    "we showed that @xmath79 where the subscripts 0 mean the present time .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 is what we previously called @xmath77 ; it is the value of the initial overdensity extrapolated using linear theory ( of the background cosmology ) to the time at which the nonlinear density is @xmath81 . also , we previously had set the growth factor in the background universe at the present time to unity : @xmath82 .",
    "we have written it explicitly here to show that , had we chosen to perform the calculation for some earlier time , then we would have found @xmath83 where the subscript 1 denotes the earlier time .",
    "i.e. , @xmath84 is the effective cosmology associated with the overdensity @xmath74 , which itself is related to @xmath81 by the spherical evolution model ( the region that is @xmath81 today was a different volume in the past , but its mass was the same . ) and , analogously to the previous expression , @xmath85 is the initial overdensity extrapolated using linear theory to the ( earlier ) time at which the nonlinear density was @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath74 is closer to 0 than is @xmath74 , @xmath85 is also closer to 0 than is @xmath86 .",
    "if one were to apply the excursion set approach to study formation histories in the effective cosmology , one would be interested in the difference between equations  ( [ highz ] ) and  ( [ lowz ] ) : @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the quantity in square brackets is @xmath88 \\ ,",
    "d_0^{-1 } = 0,\\ ] ] because @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the same quantity ( the initial overdensity ) , evolved using linear theory to two different times .",
    "in particular , @xmath85 is closer to 0 than is @xmath86 by @xmath89 .",
    "thus , @xmath90 \\ , d_0^{-1 } .\\ ] ] note that the expression on the right has _ no _ dependence on the effective cosmology .",
    "moreover , it is exactly the same as the expression that one obtains when using the excursion set approach to study formation histories in the background cosmology .",
    "it is in this sense that the formation histories of objects are independent of the effective cosmology of the environment ; the excursion set approach is a simple self - consistent way of exploiting this fact .",
    "the excursion set description provides a simple , self - consistent way of estimating the effect of environment on structure formation and evolution . in particular , it is equivalent to using the fact that the large scale environment can be thought of as providing an effective background cosmology of the same age ( section  [ equivalence ] ) . estimating the parameters of the effective cosmology is slightly more involved , but useful for running simulations which mimic the formation of structure in different environments .",
    "in essence , the equivalence between the excursion set and effective cosmology descriptions is a consequence of birkhoff s theorem : the evolution of a perturbation does not depend on its surroundings .",
    "there has been recent interest in models with modified gravitational force laws ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since birkhoff s theorem does not apply in such models @xcite , it will be interesting to see if this equivalence survives . if not , the enviromental dependence of clustering may be added as another constraint on such models .",
    "rks thanks bepi tormen for asking about this equivalence on more than one occasion , and the participants of the meeting on cosmological voids held in december 2006 at the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences .",
    "we also thank e. neistein for insisting that the excursion set and effective cosmology approaches could not be reconciled with one another .",
