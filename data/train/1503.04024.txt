    "three - body recombination is the principal source of loss of atoms in a trapped cold atomic gas .",
    "the loss rates are directly measurable as functions of the tunable interaction parameters .",
    "a number of recent experiments have provided results for various combinations of alkali atoms  @xcite .",
    "the recombination reaction can conclude with either a shallow  weakly bound  dimer , or with a deep  strongly bound  dimer .",
    "the recombination rates into shallow dimers in cold atomic gases with large scattering length exhibit the well - known universal behavior  the rates , as function of the scattering length , show the fourth power trend with the characteristic log - periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is universal  it can be described by a zero - range theory with only one parameter , the scattering length .",
    "the universal behavior is the consequence of the fact that for cold atoms with large scattering lengths both the three - body dynamics and the shallow dimers depend only on the long distance properties of the atomic interaction which is largely determined by the scattering length alone .    the deep dimers , on the contrary , can not be described by a zero - range  a long distance  theory as their properties depend on the short distance physics . for a long distance theory",
    "the recombination into deep dimers , which takes place at short distances , looks simply like a sink of probability at short distances .",
    "therefore in zero - range theories the recombination into deep dimers can be described phenomenologically by introducing one extra parameter which creates shuch a sink of probability  @xcite .",
    "we shall follow this philosophy  to introduce an extra phenomenological parameter to account for the loss of probability at short distances  and calculate the recombination rates as function of scattering length within a hyper - spherical adiabatic zero - range theory .",
    "what distinguishes us from previous investigations is that we derive a closed analytic expression which works for both one- and two - species cold gases .",
    "within the zero - range hyper - spherical adiabatic approximation  @xcite the wave - function of the three - body system is written as @xmath0 where the hyper - radius @xmath1 and the hyper - angles @xmath2 are defined in appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "the hyper - radial function @xmath3 is normalized to one in hyper - angles and for large @xmath1 loses its dependence on @xmath1 and turns into a hyper - spherical harmonic .",
    "its exact form is of no importance in the present context .",
    "the hyper - radial function @xmath4 satisfies the hyper - radial equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass - scale from the definition  ( [ eq : a : j ] ) of the hyper - radial coordinates , @xmath7 is the energy of the three - body system , and @xmath8 is the angular eigenvalue given by the lowest root of the angular eigenvalue equation .",
    "the latter depends on the scattering lengths and masses of the particles .    for a system of three identical particles",
    " which corresponds to a _",
    "one - species cold gas _  the eigenvalue - equation is given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scattering length and @xmath11 is dimensionless reduced mass from the definition  ( [ eq : a : j ] ) of the hyper - spherical coordinates and , consequently , @xmath12 . ] .",
    "for a _ two - species cold gas _ we shall consider the common situation with one light particle with mass @xmath13 and two identical heavy particles with masses @xmath14 .",
    "we shall assume that only the scattering lengths between the light and the heavy particles , @xmath15 , are large and that the scattering length @xmath16 between the heavy particles is , in comparison , negligibly small .",
    "in this case the angular eigenvalue equation is given as @xmath17   = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_1}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{-a_1}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\nu \\pi}{2}\\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath18    the shape of the effective potential in the hyper - radial equation  ( [ eq : hr ] ) for one- and two - species systems is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : it features an attractive pocket at short distances followed by a repulsive barrier at long distances  an archetypal shape , conducive to narrow resonances behind a barrier .",
    ", in the hyper - radial equation  ( [ eq : hr ] ) for one- and two - species systems . ]",
    "the dividing point , @xmath19 , between the two regions is located where the effective potential is equal zero , that is , given by the solution to the equation @xmath20 .",
    "for the one - species system @xmath21 for two - species systems we find the following numerical approximation to @xmath19 as function of the heavy - to - light mass ratio @xmath22 in the practically relevant region of mass ratios , @xmath23 the quality of the approximation is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : r0 ] .     to equation @xmath24 for two - species system as function of the heavy - to - light mass ratio @xmath22 together with a phenomenological fit . ]      in the long - distance region , @xmath25 , the solution to eigenvalue - equations for both one- and two - species systems is @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to an asymptotic equation with a ( half - integer ) centrifugal barrier , @xmath27 with the solution @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the regular and irregular bessel functions , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the phase - shift determined by the physics at short distances .    in the short - distance region , @xmath33 , the eigenvalue - equation  ( [ eq : a ] ) for the one - species system reduces to @xmath34 which has an imaginary root @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : a2c ] ) for two - species system in the short - distance region @xmath33 reduces to @xmath37   = 0 \\,,\\ ] ] which also has an imaginary root @xmath35 . however , the parameter @xmath38 now depends on the heavy - to - light mass ratio @xmath22 as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : s2c ] : increasing mass ratio increases @xmath38 , and thus the attraction at short distances .",
    ", of the solution to the short - distance eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : s2c ] ) for two - species system as function of the heavy - to - light mass ratio @xmath22 , together with a phenomenological fit . ]",
    "thus for both one- and two - species systems the hyper - radial equation at short distances acquires a super - attractive effective potential , @xmath39 where we have assumed that the energy is much smaller than the potential .",
    "the equation has two linearly independent solutions , @xmath40 or , equivalently , @xmath41 the three - body system with zero - range potentials must be regularized  @xcite at some short - range scale @xmath42 .",
    "the regularized wave - function at @xmath33 thus takes the form @xmath43      a qualitative solution to the hyper - radial equation can be obtained analytically by assuming that the two asymptotic solutions  being exact correspondingly at @xmath25 and @xmath44  are qualitatively correct also in the region @xmath45 .",
    "the phase - shift @xmath32 can then be obtained by matching the two asymptotic solutions at @xmath19 where attraction turns into repulsion .    at @xmath46",
    "the short - distance function  ( [ eq : sr ] ) arrives with the logarithmic derivative @xmath47 where the factor @xmath48 is given as @xmath49 this boundary condition causes the known log - periodic behavior of certain observables  as function of scattering length  in three - body systems with large scattering lengths .",
    "matching the short - range and the long - range solutions at @xmath46 gives the equation to determine the phase - shift @xmath32 , @xmath50 where the prime denotes the derivative of the bessel function with respect to its argument .    in the following",
    "we shall only be interested in the recombination rate at zero temperature , that is , at vanishing energies , @xmath51 . in this regime",
    "the bessel functions can be expanded as @xmath52 and then the phase - shift in the low - energy limit is given as @xmath53",
    "the long - distance hyper - radial solution  ( [ eq : asi ] ) in the limit @xmath54 becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a real number and @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath32 is a real number then @xmath58 and the hyper - radial flux density , @xmath59 vanishes  there is no loss of probability if the phase - shift @xmath32 is real .",
    "however , a complex phase shift , @xmath60 , leads to a missing flux density , @xmath61    where @xmath62    the total missing flux is obtained by integrating over the hyper - sphere .",
    "the integration element can be obtained from the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the three - dimensional volume element and @xmath65 . besides this mass factors",
    "we also need to collect the ( square of the ) factor in front of @xmath66 from the hyper - spherical expansion of the three - body plane - wave , normalized to unity within three - dimensional volume @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "collecting all factors gives the following expression for the probability loss @xmath71 per unit time  or recombination rate  within volume @xmath67 , @xmath72 the factor @xmath73 , often referred to as recombination constant @xmath74 , can be written in terms of the three - body energy @xmath75 as @xmath76 directly determines the recombination coefficients in the density balance equations for cold gases .",
    "in the zero - range model , where deep dimers are absent , the description of recombination into deep dimers , unlike recombination into shallow dimer , requires one extra parameter to make the phase - shift @xmath32 complex .",
    "this must be a short - range parameter as , indeed , to recombine into deep dimers all three atoms need to be at short - distances from each other  inside the range of their short - range potentials .",
    "this is also the region where the regularization of the zero - range three - body model takes place .",
    "therefore the recombination range should be close to the regularization range @xmath42 .",
    "the loss of probability  absorption  at short distances can be described by adding an imaginary part to the boundary condition at the regularization range . the easiest way to achieve",
    "this is to make the regularization parameter @xmath42 complex , @xmath77 the absorption parameter @xmath78 determines the extent of the absorption .    inserting the complex regularization radius  ( [ eq : reps ] ) into the expression for the phase - shift  ( [ eq : d ] ) , then the phase - shift into expression  ( [ eq:1-s2 ] ) for @xmath79 , and the latter , finally , into the recombination rate  ( [ eq : v2j ] ) gives the following expression for the recombination rate into deep dimers in our complex - boundary - condition zero - range model , @xmath80 the expression has two phenomenological parameters  the regularization range @xmath42 and the absorption intensity at short distances @xmath78 .",
    "these parameters can not be determined within the zero - range model and should be obtained by fitting the expression to experimental data .    for one - species system the shapes of recombination rates as function of scattering length for different absorption parameters",
    "are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for small absorption parameter",
    "the log - periodic peaks caused by the term @xmath81 factor are well formed .",
    "increasing the absorption smears the peaks out until they eventually disappear completely .",
    "( [ eq : v2je ] ) into deep dimers at zero temperature as function of scattering length @xmath82 for different values of the absorption parameter  @xmath78 for one - species system . ]",
    "two - species systems show similar smearing out of the log - periodic peaks with increasing the absorption parameter .",
    "however , the shape of the rate is also influenced by the heavy - to - light mass ratio , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : r2c ] :    ( [ eq : v2je ] ) into deep dimers at zero temperature as function of scattering length @xmath82 for @xmath83 and different values of the heavy - to - light mass ratio parameter  @xmath22 for two - species systems . ]",
    "increasing the mass ratio decreases the distance between the peaks and also increases the overall scale of the rate .",
    "we have investigated universal properties of the three - body recombination reaction rates into deep dimers within the zero - range hyper - spherical adiabatic approximation .",
    "although a zero - range model can not describe the deep dimers , it can still account for this reaction by introducing one extra parameter , which describes short - range absorption  or loss of probability  in the hyper - radial equation .",
    "we have used a qualitative analytic solution of the hyper - radial equation comprised of the short- and long - range asymptotic solutions matched at the middle .",
    "this resulted in an analytic expression for the recombination rate as function of scattering length and the absorption parameter .",
    "we have given the expressions for both one- and two - species cold gases , the latter with one light and two identical heavy particles .",
    "for weak absorption the recombination rate as function of scattering length shows characteristic log - periodic peaks .",
    "increasing the absorption broadens the peaks until they are eventually smeared out .    for a meaningful comparison with experimental data",
    "the effects from the scattering length between the heavy particles need to be included  @xcite .",
    "the third scattering length modifies both the @xmath38 and @xmath84 parameters in the expression for the recombination rate in a non - trivial way through significant modification of the eigenvalue equaition .",
