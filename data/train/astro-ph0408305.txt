    "from the era of the @xmath14 observatory , it was known through x - ray imaging that there is unresolved and apparently extended x - ray emission in the central region of m  31 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon was later confirmed with @xmath15 , and it has become generally believed that the emission is contributed not only by faint discrete sources but also by diffuse hot plasmas @xcite .",
    "in addition to these soft x - ray imaging studies , detailed wide - band x - ray spectral studies of m  31 have been enabled with the @xmath16 satellite ; @xcite showed that the integrated spectrum of the whole galaxy in the hard 220 kev energy band can not be represented by a power - law or a bremsstrahlung model , but can be reproduced successfully by a physical model developed for galactic high - luminosity low - mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter lmxbs ) .",
    "this model consists of a disk black - body ( dbb ) and a black - body ( bb ) component , which represent emission from an optically - thick accretion disk and a central neutron star , respectively @xcite ; we hereafter refer to this model as the lmxb model .",
    "this result confirms that bright lmxbs are dominant above the 2 kev energy range , with the 220 kev luminosity integrated over the whole m  31 reaching @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "based on these @xmath16 results , @xcite , hereafter paper  1 , analyzed the 0.610 kev @xmath18 spectra integrated over the central 12@xmath19 ( 2.4 kpc ) radius region of m  31 .",
    "this study revealed a clear spectral excess below @xmath20 1 kev when the @xmath16 spectral model mentioned above is extrapolated into the soft energy band .",
    "this excess has been represented successfully with emission from two optically - thin thermal plasmas , of which the temperatures are @xmath20 0.9 kev and @xmath20 0.3 kev .",
    "these components are spatially extended at least over the central 2.4 kpc radius , reinforcing the inference from the @xmath14 and @xmath15 images that some form of apparently diffuse hot plasma is distributed in the central region of m  31 .",
    "the spectral soft excess discovered with @xmath18 is also confirmed with @xmath21 @xcite . however , these results have been subject to a possibility that some fraction , if not all , of these thermal soft x - rays are associated with faint discrete sources rather than emitted by truly diffuse large - scale plasmas .    with the advent of the @xmath13 and @xmath0-@xmath1 satellites , it has become possible to study the extended x - ray emission after excluding point sources down to limiting luminosities of @xmath22 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "* hereafter sea01 ) actually conducted such an analysis on the @xmath0-@xmath1 spectra integrated over a central 5@xmath9 region of m  31 , first by excluding bright point sources using the x - ray image , and then modeling the contribution from unresolved faint discrete sources by scaling the average spectrum of the bright sources .",
    "they found only one optically - thin thermal plasma , of which the temperature is @xmath20 0.35 kev .",
    "this result was apparently reconfirmed by @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data thus reveal only one thermal component , while we have found two through the @xmath18 spectroscopy ( paper  1 ) .",
    "then , what causes this difference ?    at first glance , our method employed in paper  1 may appear much less reliable than the other one , in which all the bright point sources are removed through high - resolution imagery .",
    "nevertheless , we are concerned about the way employed by sea01 to estimate the faint source contribution to the residual spectrum .",
    "they estimated this contribution by scaling down a template power - law model , which was determined by fitting a summed spectrum of the removed bright sources .",
    "in reality , this bright - source spectrum is likely to be contaminated by the diffuse component , because of the limited angular resolution of @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , a power - law model is known to poorly reproduce the spectra of luminous lmxbs , as pointed out by @xcite and paper  1 . for these reasons",
    ", we expect that the analyses of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data can be improved ; this has motivated the present paper .",
    "in the present paper , we analyze archival data of the m  31 central region obtained by @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 . although these datasets have already been analyzed for diffuse emission by other authors ( garcia et al .",
    "2000 ; primini et al .",
    "2000 ; sea01 ; dosaj et al .  2002 ) , there still remains room for improved analyses as described in @xmath23  1 , especially in comparison with paper  1 and employing more appropriate modeling of the point - source spectra .",
    "here we describe the observation and data screening .      among the @xmath0-@xmath1 archival data ,",
    "there are four observations of the central region of m  31 ( observation i d = 0109270101 , 0112570101 , 0112570401 and 0112570601 ) , all with the same pointing direction .",
    "while sea01 analyzed the 0112570401 dataset as the proprietors , we here analyze the 0112570101 dataset , which has the longest exposure of the four .",
    "the 0112570101 dataset is characterized in table  [ tab : obs ] , and its field of view is shown over an optical image in figure  [ fig : m31_image ] together with that used for our previous @xmath18 results ( paper  1 ) .",
    "the x - ray images obtained by the mos1 , mos2 and pn detectors are superposed in figure  [ fig : m31_ximage]a .",
    "as already reported ( sea01 ) , the image clearly reveals the extended , apparently diffuse x - ray emission in the central region .",
    "we performed sas standard data screening for the mos1 , mos2 and pn data . in this observation",
    ", a small background flare occurred only in pn , and the pn events during the flare were discarded ; the achieved exposure is 60 ks with each mos detector , and 49 ks with the pn . over the @xmath24 radius field of view",
    ", we detected 212 point sources by the ciao source detection method ( wavdetect ) with a detection limit of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ; point spread functions have no effect on the actual source detection , but they are used in the estimation of the source properties , such as extent or flux and so on , which the wavdetect routine reports ( from the ciao detect manual ) . around each source , we then excluded a circular region of radius @xmath25@xmath26 , as specified by the wavdetect routine referring to the source image size , the source intensity over the surrounding background level , and the off - axis angle . according to the @xmath0-@xmath1 users handbook ,",
    "@xmath20 85% of photons from each point source can be excluded by using these radii . in order to study the extended emission ,",
    "the remaining events were accumulated over a circular region centered on the nucleus with a radius of 6@xmath9 .",
    "then , we constructed energy spectra of individual detectors in the 0.47 kev energy band .    while our primary objective is to study the unresolved diffuse emission , it is of similar importance to examine the average spectra of bright point sources .",
    "we have therefore accumulated the events of 92 point sources falling within the 6@xmath9 radius , which were once removed in the previous step , and constructed another set of 0.410 kev spectra . to extract the events , we here employed event extraction radii twice as small as those used in deriving the above diffuse spectra",
    "; now @xmath20 60% of events from each point source are extracted .",
    "these events are dominated by the discrete - source photons , but are contaminated to some extent by the unresolved emission .    to analyze the extended - emission spectra , we generated response matrices ( one for each detector ) by sas taking the weighted means of place - by - place responses in reference to the brightness distribution of the extended emission . to fit the summed point - source spectra , we similarly generated responses as weighted means of those of the individual point sources . in order to take into account possible uncertainties introduced by these averaging processes , we assign 5% systematic errors over 0.42 kev to both sets of spectra .",
    "background spectra for both the unresolved and point - source emission were constructed from the corresponding detector regions of blank - sky observation datasets ( exposure 350 ks with the pn and 1000 ks with each mos ) provided by @xcite . in the energy range above 12 kev , the count rate of the derived pn background spectra",
    "coincide , within @xmath20 2% , with those of the on - source spectra , in agreement with the report by @xcite that the epic background fluctuates by no more than 8% ( at 1 @xmath27 level ) from observation to observation .",
    "similarly , the 712 kev mos1 and mos2 background spectra have been confirmed to agree within 5% with the extended - emission spectra from the corresponding detectors .",
    "( such a comparison is difficult for the summed point - source spectra because of the signal detection up to @xmath20 12 kev . )",
    "thus , the uncertainties associated with the subtraction of the detector backgrounds are estimated to be significantly smaller than photon counting errors .",
    "we must in addition consider systematic uncertainties in the sky - background subtraction , including in particular the @xmath20 35% non - uniformity in the soft x - ray sky brightness @xcite .",
    "however , this is again negligible in the relevant soft x - ray range , where the signals ( both extended emission and summed point sources ) exceed the background by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "there are already many archival @xmath13 datasets of the central region of m31 , with repeated pointings . because we need energy spectra especially in the low energy band , we here select the archived acis - s data with the longest exposure ( observation i d = 1575 ; table  [ tab : obs ] ) , which allows us to utilize a larger effective area in energies below @xmath20 5 kev than the acis - i data ; in contrast , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the acis - i data .",
    "in the present analysis , we use only the data from the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "its field of view and x - ray image are presented in figure  [ fig : m31_image ] and figure  [ fig : m31_ximage]b , respectively .",
    "we screened the data in the standard manner , and further discarded the data acquired during small background flares which occurred in the observation .",
    "the usable exposure amounts to 29 ks .",
    "we also removed the events on the columns along the readout streak of the brightest source .",
    "using the same ciao wavdetect routine as the @xmath0-@xmath1 data , 90 point sources were detected over the @xmath28 acis - s3 field of view , with the limiting luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath3 for a typical source spectrum .",
    "this limit is much lower than those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who used short ( 510 ks ) exposure datasets , and comparable to that of @xcite who combined 8 separate acis - i observations to achieve a total exposure of @xmath20 40 ks .",
    "we then discarded circular regions of radii @xmath30@xmath31 ( depending on the source image size , the intensity , and the position from the aim point , like in the @xmath0-@xmath1 case ) around the individual sources .",
    "simulations using the chart software predict that @xmath20 94% events from the detected point sources are thus excluded . using the remaining events , we constructed an energy spectrum covering a circular region centered on the nucleus within a radius of 3@xmath9 . because the acis - s3 field of view is limited to @xmath28 and its aim point",
    "is not located at the center of the chip , the full 6@xmath9 radius region is unavailable .",
    "even the 3@xmath9 region falls outside the field of view by 6% at the western edge .",
    "we generated the response matrix by a ciao weighted averaging method similar to the @xmath0-@xmath1 case , and applied a correction for the degradation in the low - energy quantum efficiency of the acis chips since the launch .",
    "the background spectrum was collected from the corresponding s3 region of blank - sky observation datasets ( exposure 450 ks ) provided by the acis calibration team .",
    "it is known that the background rates of blank - sky data vary , from observation to observation , by up to @xmath20 40% in energies below 5 kev . however",
    ", this uncertainty can be ignored in the 0.452 kev energy band , because the observed count rate is an order of magnitude higher than the background level . in the 25 kev band where the background systematics are more severe , we confirmed that the blank - sky subtracted spectrum obtained in this way agrees , within 6% , with that obtained by subtracting another background acquired with the other back - illuminated s1 chip ( excluding two point sources ) during the same on - source observation ; the s1 and s3 backgrounds are generally known to coincide with each other within 3% in this energy band ( http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~maxim/axaf/acisbg/data/readme ) .",
    "therefore , we here analyze the energy spectrum over the total 0.457 kev energy band , after subtracting the blank - sky background spectrum . because of relatively poor statistics",
    ", we do not utilize these @xmath13 data to quantify the spectra of the detected sources .",
    "although sea01 already analyzed the summed spectra of the detected point sources with a single power - law ( pl for short ) model , we here repeat the analysis for consistency , by considering a small amount of flux contribution from the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : lmxb ] shows the mos and pn spectra obtained in @xmath23  2.1 , as a sum over the 92 sources detected within @xmath4 . as described in @xmath23  2 , they have been collected from regions of which the summed area amounts to @xmath20 10% of the total @xmath4 radius region . according to the spectral decomposition in paper  1 ,",
    "more than half the overall flux of m  31 below @xmath32 kev comes from the diffuse component . from these two facts ,",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is expected to contribute @xmath33% to the spectra of figure  [ fig : lmxb ] . with this in mind , we analyzed the 0.410 kev portion of the mos and pn spectra of figure  [ fig : lmxb ] .",
    "we first fitted the spectra above 2 kev , where point sources are dominant ( paper  1 ) , employing the physical lmxb model ( a dbb plus a bb ) to represent luminous point sources in m  31 ( @xmath23  1 ) .",
    "we allowed the photoelectric absorption column density to vary freely , but constrained it to be higher than @xmath34 @xmath35 which corresponds to the galactic value along the line of sight toward m  31 ( from einline and w3nh ) .",
    "this lmxb model has successfully reproduced the spectra ( figure  [ fig : lmxb]a and table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) , and the obtained temperatures are consistent with those ( the innermost disk temperature of @xmath36 1 kev and the blackbody temperature of @xmath37 2 kev ) in @xcite and paper  1 . the obtained total luminosity ( here and hereafter ,",
    "we quote luminosities in the 0.510 kev range ) , @xmath38 erg s@xmath3 , is also consistent with that of the spectral hard component in paper  1 , @xmath39 erg s@xmath3 ; the difference can be explained by a flux leakage ( @xmath40% ) outside the event accumulation regions around the point sources , and an additional contribution to the @xmath18 spectra by sources below the present detection threshold [ estimated to be @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 using the log @xmath42log @xmath43 relation by @xcite ] . moreover , our luminosity integrated over the @xmath4 radius compares reasonably with the 220 kev value of the whole m  31 derived with @xmath16 , @xmath44 erg s@xmath3 @xcite . following these consistent results among the three satellites , we hereafter fix @xmath45 at 2 kev , to prevent the value from becoming unconstrained when the soft energy band with much higher statistics is included . when we re - fitted the 210 kev mos and pn spectra by replacing the lmxb model with a pl ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) , the model was too flat to reproduce the spectra in the hard energy band as mentioned in paper  1 .    when the successful lmxb fit determined in the 210 kev band is extrapolated down to the same lower energy bound of 0.6 kev as employed in the @xmath18 analyses , the data exhibit excess above the model prediction ( figure  [ fig : lmxb]a ) .",
    "if we re - adjust the model parameters except @xmath45 fixed at 2 kev , the fit is improved but still remains unacceptable ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) . restoring the pl model , which was once rejected , gives consistent parameters as obtained by sea01 [ the photon index of @xmath46 and the absorption column density @xmath47 @xmath35 ] , but the fit is again unacceptable ( figure  [ fig : lmxb]b and table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) .",
    "moreover , essentially the same problem is also seen in the discrete - source spectra analyzed by sea01 ; the data deviate from the model at 1 kev , like in our figure  [ fig : lmxb]b .",
    "since we expect that the above fit failures are caused by a small amount of diffuse flux which leaked into the regions around the point sources , we have added two thin - thermal plasma emission components to the lmxb fit after the @xmath18 results ( paper  1 ) .",
    "as the plasma emission code , we use the mekal model ( mkl for short ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the improved fe - l modeling , instead of the raymond - smith code ( rs for short ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) employed in paper  1 .",
    "the absorption within m  31 is thought to be rather low , so we here and hereafter fix the absorption of thin - thermal plasmas at the galactic value [ @xmath47 @xmath35 ] .",
    "for the moment , we constrain for simplicity the plasma abundances at 1 solar in addition .",
    "this model , denoted lmxb+2mkl model , has successfully reproduced the spectra above 0.6 kev ( figure  [ fig : lmxb]c ) , and the measured lmxb and two mkl temperatures are consistent with those in paper  1 ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) .",
    "thus , the lmxb model , when softer mkl contributions are included , can successfully reproduce the entire 0.610 kev spectra of the summed point sources .",
    "although thus successful in energies above 0.6 kev , the lmxb+2mkl model again falls below the observed spectra , when extrapolated toward lower energies .",
    "this can be attributed to yet another diffuse component of a still lower temperature leaking into the spectra , as identified later in @xmath23  3.3 using the diffuse - emission spectra .      in order to quantify the diffuse x - ray emission using the @xmath0-@xmath1 data",
    ", we jointly analyzed the residual mos and pn spectra of the central 6@xmath9 region , obtained by removing the point sources as described in @xmath23  2 .",
    "the spectra , shown in figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev ] , are considerably softer than those for bright point sources ( figure  [ fig : lmxb ] ) , and bear a clear hump over 0.71.0 kev due to the fe - l complex indicative of the dominance of soft thermal emission .",
    "moreover , the spectra extend significantly toward higher energies than would be expected for the softer thermal emission .",
    "this is mainly considered to have two origins .",
    "one is the @xmath49 spill - over of photons from the detected bright point sources out of the accumulation regions ; this is estimated to contribute @xmath50 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the other is contribution from discrete sources below our detection limit , which is estimated to be @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 based on the log @xmath42log @xmath43 relation of @xcite .",
    "since the former dominates , we model the hard component in the `` diffuse '' spectra ( figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev ] ) by the lmxb model in contrast to sea01 who used a pl modeling , which is ruled out in our analyses ( @xmath23  3.1 ) .",
    "because the absorption column density of the summed point - source spectra is consistent with the galactic value ( table  [ tab : lmxb ] ) , we here and hereafter apply the galactic @xmath51 to the lmxb component , as well as to the thin - thermal plasma components ( @xmath23  3.1 ) .",
    "the abundances of elements are allowed to vary freely , but their relative values are constrained to follow the solar ratios .",
    "we tentatively limited the fit energy band to 0.67 kev , to compare with the @xmath18 results ( paper  1 ) . the si - k energy band ( 1.681.80 kev ) of both mos detectors",
    "was excluded , because the background contribution and uncertainty are rather large there @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev]a shows the simplest model , i.e. , one lmxb plus one - temperature mkl model ( lmxb+1mkl model ) , fitted simultaneously to the mos and pn spectra over the 0.67 kev range .",
    "the obtained parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "thus , an mkl component with the temperature 0.30.4 kev roughly accounts for the softer part of the spectrum , but there remains excess around 0.9 kev , which makes the fit statistically unacceptable .",
    "if we use the same model as sea01 , namely one pl plus one mkl model ( pl+1mkl ) , the pl photon index ( @xmath52 ) and the mkl temperature ( @xmath53 kev ) become close to their results ( figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev]b and table  [ tab : fit ] ) , but the excess remains as well .",
    "since this energy band is dominated by the fe - l line complex which is rather sensitive to the temperature , the failure of the lmxb+1mkl ( or pl+1mkl ) model suggests , as we expected , that the thin thermal plasma distributed in the central @xmath20 1.2 kpc region of m  31 can not be described by a single temperature .    to improve the model",
    ", we added another mkl component .",
    "this model , lmxb+2mkl model , is essentially the same as that used in paper  1 , except the plasma codes .",
    "as presented in figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev]c and table  [ tab : fit ] , this model has successfully reproduced the 0.67 kev spectra , yielding two temperatures of @xmath6 kev and @xmath7 kev . these results reconfirm the conclusion of paper  1 that two sub - kev temperatures are needed to reproduce the 0.610 kev @xmath18 over a 12@xmath9 radius region around the m  31 nucleus .",
    "although the temperature of the hotter plasma ( @xmath6 kev ) obtained in this way is a little lower than that in paper  1 ( 0.9 kev ) , the disagreement can be attributed to the difference of the plasma models .",
    "actually , it becomes 0.8 kev ( figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev]d and table  [ tab : fit ] ) , in good agreement with paper  1 , when we restore the rs models ( lmxb+2rs model ) instead of the mkl ( lmxb+2mkl ) .",
    "we tentatively identify the present 0.6 kev component with the 0.9 kev one found with @xmath18 .",
    "incidentally , the rs model gives a worse @xmath54 , due to a residual structure around 1 kev which probably arises from an insufficient modeling of the fe - l complex .",
    "when the lmxb+2mkl model determined in the 0.67 kev band is extrapolated toward lower energies , the model prediction falls significantly short of the actual data ( figure  [ fig:0.6 - 7kev]c ) . as a result ,",
    "the lmxb+2mkl fit actually becomes unacceptable when the 0.40.6 kev band is included .",
    "the fit is improved by re - adjusting the model parameters except @xmath51 and @xmath45 . nevertheless , the temperature of the cooler mkl component becomes lower than that obtained in @xmath23  3.2 , and the abundances are too low .",
    "when the temperature and abundances are fixed even at 0.25 kev and the 0.1 solar values , respectively , the fit becomes unacceptable ( @xmath54/d.o.f .",
    "= 819/706 ) .",
    "in short , the lmxb+2mkl modeling does not give a reasonable account of the 0.47 kev spectra .",
    "this in turn suggests the presence of a forth , and the softest , emission component , which was not detected with @xmath18 ( paper  1 ) , because of the limited soft x - ray sensitivity .",
    "the softest component may be contributed by o - k lines appearing in the 0.50.6 kev range .",
    "we therefore added one more mkl component to jointly fit the total - band ( 0.47 kev ) mos / pn spectra . here and hereafter",
    ", we allow the nitrogen abundance to vary freely , without obeying the solar ratio , because its k - lines appear at the softest end of the spectra , where the instrumental uncertainty is rather large @xcite and yet the data statistics are very high .",
    "we do not address the obtained nitrogen abundance , because it does not deviate much from 1 solar .",
    "this model , denoted as lmxb+3mkl model , has indeed decreased @xmath55 , as shown in figure  [ fig:0.4 - 7kev ] and table  [ tab : fit ] , and has made the fit acceptable . according to an @xmath56-test ,",
    "the @xmath55 difference is significant at a @xmath57 99% confidence level .",
    "the obtained parameters are also consistent with those in @xmath23  3.2 .",
    "thus , the diffuse x - ray emission from the central region of m  31 can be understood as a sum of the three components with the temperatures of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 kev .",
    "below , we assess the credibility of this interpretation from several aspects .",
    "we have so far fixed the absorption column density of the lmxb model at the galactic value .",
    "however , some point sources may suffer excess absorption within m  31 .",
    "in order to examine such a possibility , we analyzed the 0.410 kev spectra of the 7 brightest point sources within the 6@xmath9 radius regions ( blue circled in figure  [ fig : m31_ximage]a ) , of which the summed flux accounts for @xmath20 50% of that analyzed here .",
    "the lmxb model successfully reproduced their spectra in general , yielding the absorption column densities in the range ( 16 ) @xmath58 @xmath35 with a typical uncertainty of @xmath59 @xmath35 .",
    "as another examination , we tentatively constrained the lmxb absorption at the three times larger or smaller values ( @xmath60 @xmath35 or @xmath61 @xmath35 ) while retaining those of the mkl components at the galactic value .",
    "however , the lmxb+3mkl fits did not change significantly ( @xmath54/d.o.f .",
    "= 772/702 and 769/702 , respectively ) , and the overall model parameters remained unchanged within @xmath62 10% .",
    "this result is easily understandable , because the observed diffuse signal below @xmath20 1 kev is comparable to that from the summed point sources ( @xmath23  3.1 ) , and hence is @xmath20 4 times higher than that estimated from the spill - over of the excluded point sources . in short ,",
    "we are thus justified in fixing the absorption of the lmxb component at the galactic value .",
    "the derived mkl abundances are rather low at their face values . however ,",
    "fixing them at 0.3 solar worsen the fit only slightly , to @xmath54/d.o.f .",
    "= 792/703 , without significant changes in the other parameters . considering the complexity of our final spectral model , we hence put reservations on the metallicity of our thermal components .    at @xmath63 south - east of the nucleus ( indicated with a black circle in figure  [ fig : m31_ximage]a ) ,",
    "a super soft source ( sss ) has been detected @xcite . in our data ,",
    "it is luminous ( absorbed luminosity @xmath64 erg s@xmath3 in 0.32 kev ) , and its spectrum can be reproduced by the same modeling as that used by @xcite , namely the sum of a bb ( temperature @xmath65 ev ) and a pl ( photon index fixed at 2.0 ) with the absorption column density @xmath66 @xmath35 .",
    "although we excluded this sss , the @xmath49 spill - over of its counts may be contributing to the softest component , because the spectral shape of the sss is totally different from that of the bright lmxbs and its contribution can not be accounted for by the lmxb model .",
    "accordingly , we repeated the lmxb+3mkl fit , but further adding an absorbed ( @xmath51 = @xmath67 @xmath35 ) bb of which the temperature is fixed at 53 ev and the normalization is constrained at 15% of the sss spectrum .",
    "the pl component of the sss is negligible . as a result ,",
    "the luminosity of each mkl component has decreased by only 24@xmath68 , and the other parameters have remained unchanged within the errors .",
    "therefore , we ignore the sss spill - over .",
    "in order to confirm our @xmath0-@xmath1 results under a more stringent point - source elimination , we have analyzed the 0.457 kev @xmath13 spectrum of the central 3@xmath9 region , obtained after removing the point sources as described in @xmath23  2.2 .",
    "the total area removed by this process is similar between @xmath13 and @xmath0-@xmath1 , because the larger areas of the @xmath0-@xmath1 data around individual sources are approximately compensated by the smaller number of detected point sources in the crowded region around the nucleus .",
    "the derived acis spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:0.45 - 7kev ] .",
    "the spectral fitting was executed in the same way as those of @xmath0-@xmath1 , namely the lmxb plus a few mkl models with the galactic absorption , because the @xmath20 6% spill - over of the excluded point sources is still dominant over the sum of undetected faint sources .",
    "the former is estimated to be @xmath69 erg s@xmath3 , by multiplying the 0.510 kev total luminosity of the detected point sources ( @xmath70 erg s@xmath3 ; converted from the observed count rates output by the wavdetect routine in @xmath23  2.2 ) , with the spill - over ratio of the @xmath13 x - ray mirror ( @xmath71 ) , while the latter is estimated as @xmath72 erg s@xmath3 , by extrapolating the luminosity function obtained by @xcite",
    ".    table  [ tab : fit2 ] lists the results of fitting the 0.457 kev acis - s spectrum with four trial models .",
    "while the single lmxb model is far from being acceptable , the addition of one mkl component drastically improve the fit , reconfirming the dominance of thermal x - rays in this `` diffuse '' spectrum .",
    "the @xmath54 decreases introduced by the 2nd and 3rd mkl components are also significant at @xmath57 99 % confidence levels according to the @xmath56-test .",
    "the obtained temperatures of the three mkl plasmas are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 kev with the @xmath20 0.3 solar abundance , in good agreement with the @xmath0-@xmath1 results ( @xmath23  3.3 ) .",
    "thus , it is confirmed that the @xmath13 spectrum within the central 3@xmath9 ( @xmath20 0.6 kpc ) region also contains the three thin - thermal plasma components .",
    "to confirm the reality and the nature of the four spectroscopic components constituting the lmxb+3mkl model , we next study their radial brightness distributions .",
    "accordingly , we again produced the @xmath0-@xmath1 spectra ( together with the blank - sky backgrounds and response matrices ) of the extended emission in the same way as in @xmath23  2.1 , but using 6 annular regions of 1@xmath9 width each , from the nucleus to a radius of 6@xmath9 .",
    "these spectra have actually been well ( @xmath54/d.o.f .  = 1.091.16 ) reproduced by the same lmxb+3mkl model under the same conditions as used in @xmath23  3.4 and 4 , except that the metal abundances other than nitrogen are fixed at 0.3 solar units .",
    "similarly , the @xmath13/acis - s3 spectra derived from the same annular regions were fitted successfully ( @xmath54/d.o.f .",
    "= 0.991.26 ) by the same lmxb+3mkl model . in these fits to the epic and acis spectra using the different annuli , the three mkl temperatures have always been found at @xmath20 0.6 , @xmath20 0.3 and @xmath20 0.1 kev as shown in figure  [ fig : temperature ] , although we sometimes had to fix some mkl temperatures at their canonical values because of poor statistics .",
    "the surface brightness of the four components from these fits is plotted in figure  [ fig : luminosity ] as a function of the radius .",
    "the results on the three diffuse x - ray components thus agree approximately within errors between the two satellites , even though the contribution from point sources is different ; the `` diffuse '' spectra obtained with @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 are contributed by @xmath49 and @xmath71 from luminous ( @xmath73 erg s@xmath3 ) sources , respectively .",
    "the slight disagreement between them , seen in the innermost annulus , may be attributed to a much heavier point - source elimination from the @xmath0-@xmath1 image .    in figure",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] , all the mkl components exhibit gradually decreasing radial brightness profiles .",
    "if we fit them with an exponential function as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the projected radial distance from the nucleus and @xmath76 is the scale height , we obtain @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , for the 0.6 , 0.3 and 0.1 kev components , respectively . thus , the 0.6 kev component is considerably more centrally peaked than the other two , of which the profiles are not significantly different .",
    "the integrated @xmath0-@xmath1 luminosities of the three mkl components within @xmath4 become @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath11 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath12 erg s@xmath3 in the order of decreasing temperature .",
    "the former two values are consistent with the @xmath18 results ( paper  1 ) within errors , where we identify the 0.9 kev rs component detected by @xmath18 with the 0.6 kev mkl plasma here .",
    "using the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data , we have confirmed that the spectra of the central regions of m  31 , obtained after removing point sources above @xmath73 erg s@xmath3 , can be described by a sum of the four spectral components : the hard component which is mainly contributed by the photons which spill over from the excluded point sources , and the 0.6 , 0.3 and 0.1 kev mkl components .",
    "the softer three thermal components have been quantified in a consistent manner by the three satellites ( @xmath0-@xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "all the thermal components are radially extended to a typical scale of @xmath20 1@xmath9.5 ( 0.3 kpc ) , in agreement with the repeated detections of unresolved , possibly diffuse , soft x - ray emission ( trinchieri and fabbiano 1991 ; primini et al .  1993 ; supper et al .",

    "these results agree with the main achievement of @xcite using @xmath16 and paper  1 using @xmath18 .    for a further confirmation of self - consistency",
    ", we attempted to reproduce the summed point - source spectra over the entire 0.410 kev ( rather than in the @xmath57 0.6 kev range ) by the lmxb+3mkl model , of which the mkl temperatures were constrained at 0.6 , 0.3 and 0.1 kev and the metal abundances other than nitrogen of all the three mkl components were fixed at 0.3 solar units .",
    "the result is moderately successful with @xmath54/d.o.f .",
    "= 1748/1408 , and the fit residuals are at most 10% of the data .",
    "the obtained luminosities of the 3 mkl components become @xmath80 erg s@xmath3 , @xmath81 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath82 erg s@xmath3 in the order of decreasing temperature , and correspond to @xmath20 3040% of the integrated luminosity within 6@xmath9 of each diffuse emission ( @xmath23  5 ) .",
    "this percentage is reasonable , considering that the event - collection area of the summed point - source spectra occupies @xmath20 10% of the 6@xmath9 radius region , and that the point sources concentrate around the nucleus where the diffuse emission is also bright .",
    "this result confirms that the 3 mkl components found in the summed point - source spectra are contaminations of the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the 0.510 kev luminosity of the hard component found in the @xmath0-@xmath1 data , represented by the lmxb model , becomes @xmath83 erg s@xmath3 when integrated over the @xmath4 radius .",
    "it is primarily attributable to the spill - over from the excluded point sources ( @xmath50 erg s@xmath3 ; @xmath23  3.2 ) , with a smaller contribution from unresolved faint sources ( @xmath41 erg s@xmath3 ) . after subtracting these two estimates ,",
    "we are left with an unexplained hard - component luminosity of @xmath84 erg s@xmath3 in the @xmath0-@xmath1 spectra of the diffuse emission .",

    "these facts suggests the presence of yet another , rather hot , diffuse emission in the central region of m  31 .    in a detailed examination of the @xmath0-@xmath1 diffuse spectra ( figure  [ fig:0.4 - 7kev ] )",
    ", we find a hint of excess just below 7 kev , which may correspond to fe - k lines . indeed , a single pl fit to the 37 kev portion of the @xmath0-@xmath1 spectra within 6@xmath9 , with @xmath54/d.o.f .",

    "moreover , if we add one more mkl component to the lmxb+3mkl model in @xmath23  3.3 , where the metal abundances other than nitrogen of all the four mkl components are fixed at 0.3 solar units referring to oxygen abundances of planetary nebulae in the bulge of m31 @xcite , the entire 0.47 kev @xmath0-@xmath1 spectra in the 6@xmath9 radius is reproduced better ( @xmath54/d.o.f .  decreasing to 768/701 from 792/703 ) , with insignificant changes in the parameters of the other mkl components .",
    "the temperature and luminosity of the added fourth mkl have been obtained as @xmath89 kev and @xmath90 erg s@xmath3 respectively , within the 6@xmath9 radius .",
    "the inferred luminosity of this hot mkl component agrees with the unexplained hard - component luminosity .",
    "although the @xmath13 spectrum within 3@xmath9 does not clearly reveal the fe - k line , the same analysis yields a hot mkl temperature of @xmath33 kev and a luminosity of @xmath91 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the center energy of the fe - k line , the implied temperature ( several kev ) , and the luminosity of this hot and possible extended thermal emission are similar to those of the hot component of the galactic ridge emission @xcite and the galactic bulge emission @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray ( @xmath62 2 kev ) spectra of the diffuse emission generally require more than one temperature components , even if we use relatively narrow ( 1@xmath9 @xmath20 0.2 kpc ) annular regions .",

    "therefore , we regard the three temperatures as real existences , rather than caused by temperature gradients .",
    "the larger scale radii of the softer two components than that of the 0.6 kev emission ( figure  [ fig : luminosity ] ) can explain the outward temperature decrease ( from @xmath20 0.5 kev near the nucleus to @xmath20 0.3 kev at 8@xmath9 ) , which @xcite obtained using a single - temperature approach .    the @xmath6 kev thin - thermal plasma emission is a new component which has first been detected in paper  1 , but not by other authors ( primini et al .",

    ", we have successfully detected this component in the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data . as argued in paper  1 ,",

    "( 2002 ) . in view of the agreement on this component among the three satellites ,",
    "its reality appears to be secure .",
    "as proposed in west et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and paper  1 , it can be considered as an assembly of stellar coronae , although this does not exclude other possibilities .",
    "the last diffuse x - ray plasma component , of which the temperature is @xmath8 kev , has been newly revealed in the present study .",
    "the obtained temperature and luminosity agree between the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data sets .",
    "one obvious candidate for this coolest mkl component is an assembly of hot bubbles , such as the one surrounding the solar system with a temperature @xmath8 kev @xcite . using @xmath15 , @xcite estimated the local hot bubble to have a luminosity of ( 512 ) @xmath92 erg s@xmath3 and a radius of 100200 pc .",
    "then , the measured luminosity of the 0.1 kev mkl component in m  31 within 6@xmath9 ( 1.2 kpc ) , @xmath93 erg s@xmath3 ( 0.12.4 kev ) , could be explained if similar bubbles are present in m  31 with a relatively high ( @xmath20 0.8 ) volume filling factor , assuming a disk scale height of @xmath94 pc .",
    "the local hot bubble around the solar system itself contributes little to the observed 0.1 kev mkl component .",
    "now that we have confirmed the consistency among the @xmath18 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath13 data sets , we finally examine their consistency with the @xmath15 image analysis . using the @xmath15 images , @xcite and @xcite showed that there remains apparently `` diffuse '' emission in the central 5@xmath9 radius region of m  31 , after subtracting detected point sources .",
    "its count rate was measured at 0.247 counts s@xmath3 without correction for the eliminated area around detected point sources @xcite . based on our spectral analyses ,",
    "the total luminosity of the truly diffuse emission is estimated as @xmath95 erg s@xmath3 in the corresponding region and the @xmath15 energy band ( 0.12.4 kev ) .",
    "this in turn is estimated to give @xmath20 0.28 counts s@xmath3 in the @xmath15/pspc ( from webpimms ) , in a rough agreement with the actually observed rate .",
