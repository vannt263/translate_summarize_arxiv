    "the role of phonons in high - temperature superconductors is complex . on the one hand",

    "on the other hand , a large number of studies show that certain phonons at least are coupled to the carriers , and that this coupling is unconventional @xcite .",
    "the frequencies and widths of certain phonon lines , again in the optimally - doped materials ( precisely those where the isotope effect is small ) , undergo abrupt changes at @xmath6 .",
    "this effect was first observed by infrared spectroscopy @xcite , then by raman spectroscopy @xcite , resonant neutron - absorption spectroscopy @xcite and neutron scattering @xcite .",

    "c_-axis phonon spectra of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 as we change the oxygen doping .",
    "these spectra can be separated from the weak and smooth electronic background conductivity whose intensity rises with doping from a few @xmath11 in the @xmath12 material to 450  @xmath11 in overdoped samples @xcite .",
    "the background is due to inter - cell hopping of free carriers @xcite .",
    "superimposed on this electronic background are five strong phonon lines .",
    "these five lines are also seen the in the spectra of ceramic superconductors @xcite , and have been studied by a large number of groups .",
    "the extensive literature on ceramic spectra has been summarized by feile in ref .  .",
    "however , in ceramics , effects due to the background _ ab_-plane conductivity distort the spectra , particularly the line strengths , and the _ c_-axis polarized phonons are best studied in single crystals .",
    "single crystal studies are difficult due to the small area of the available flux - grown samples .",
    "nevertheless , a number of studies have appeared , with yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 being the most studied material [ see footnote 3 and refs .  ] . in the present work single crystals with cleaved surfaces",

    "it is clear from the shell models that infrared modes , unlike raman modes , which can often be assigned to the motion of a particular ion , usually involve the motion of all the ions in the unit cell .",
    "the shell - model eigenvectors suggest that there are some exceptions .",

    ", the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "what is surprising is the excellent agreement between the measured line strengths , and those predicted by the shell - model eigenvectors . in calculating the line strengths we have used two separate approaches :",
    "the simplest is to use the formal charges of the ions in all cases .",
    "the only case where this seems to be inappropriate is for the 570  @xmath5 mode where the observed line strength is larger , and a larger effective charge on the o(4 ) would give better agreement between the model and the infrared observations .",
    "this line is also anomalous in that it develops a strong asymmetry in the oxygen - reduced materials , a sign of strong electron - phonon interaction which may enhance the polarizability of the mode by dynamic charge transfer from the o(4 ) to the planes .",
    "the second approach is to use a least - squares fit to the effective charges to the observed infrared oscillator strengths .",
    "the results are shown in column six of table  [ neutrons ] .",
    "the fitted results , as expected , agree better with the optical data . however , it is interesting to note that in order to get this better fit , the main change was the removal of charge from the o(4 ) ion , and the addition of that charge on the planar oxygen ions .",
    "the two missing lines are predicted by the shell model to be very weak . of these",
    "there is some evidence for the lower one predicted to be at 111 @xmath5 in some of our spectra , but they are near the limit of the accuracy of the experiments .    two modes not predicted by the shell model are seen : the broad band at @xmath26 @xmath5 , and weak peak at @xmath27  @xmath5 . in what follows",
    "we will argue that the 610  @xmath5 line is associated with the two - fold coordinated copper neighbor of the o(4 ) oxygen .",
    "such sites are found in oxygen - reduced material where the 610 @xmath5 line is much stronger , and its presence in our @xmath14 sample is an indication that this sample contains a small concentration of broken chain fragments with two - fold coordinated copper .",
    "overall , at room temperature at least , there is good agreement with the shell model and the observed phonon spectrum and there is no need to invoke special electronic enhancements to explain the intensities of the phonon lines , nor is there any evidence of strong screening by the electronic background .",
    "as the doping level is reduced , a number of changes in the phonon parameters take place ; these are summarized for the five fundamental phonons observed in the highly - doped material , as well as the two strong splittings associated with the 155 and 570 @xmath5 modes at 10  k observed at lower dopings , in fig .",
    "[ parms ] . to a first approximation one expects the phonon frequencies to soften with the expansion of the _ c_-axis lattice parameter .",
    "one generally expects the frequency to vary approximately as the third power of the lattice parameter @xcite . since the _ c_-axis lattice parameter increases by 0.5% between @xmath49 to @xmath50",
    ", one would expect an overall softening of the order of 1.5% as the result of the lattice expansion    in very rough agreement with this simple picture , many modes soften , but by a larger amount of 3.5% in this doping range .",
    "there are also several notable exceptions .",
    "first there is a tendency , at room temperature , for several modes to harden as the lattice expands on removal of oxygen , for example the 312 @xmath5 mode .",
    "the 155 @xmath5 mode as well as the high - frequency o(4 ) mode behave in a similar fashion : they split into two components , the higher frequency component hardens , the lower frequency one softens .",
    "as we will show below for the 570 @xmath5 mode , and its high - frequency partner the 610 @xmath5 mode the higher frequency component corresponds to the o(4 ) at the two - fold coordinated copper sites whereas the lower frequency corresponds to the o(4 ) at the four - fold coordinated copper sites .",
    "while the shell model eigenvectors suggest that the 155  @xmath5 mode also involves a large amount of o(4 ) motion , many other atoms in the unit cell participate in the motion , and the net result is a behavior that is opposite to that for the 570 @xmath5 mode : it is the high - frequency , hard component that loses oscillator strength .",
    "the mode at @xmath51 @xmath5 in the highly - doped material has split into a doublet in the @xmath52 material , and consists of at least three lines in the @xmath28 material ; the phonon lines are significantly broader than the narrow line in the @xmath14 material . fig .",
    "[ barium ] shows the evolution of the shape of this line with doping .",
    "the multi - component nature of the line and the gradual shift , with reduced doping to lower frequency components is reminiscent of the 500  @xmath5 raman line which has been shown to have many components , associated with chain disorder in underdoped samples @xcite .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath51  @xmath5 mode is also associated with the loss of o(1 ) chain oxygens .",
    "unlike the 570  @xmath5 mode , where the o(4)cu(1 ) chain - copper bond is stretched , the 155  @xmath5 mode involves the o(4)cu(2 ) bond which is also expected to change its length as the cu(1 ) changes from four- to two - fold coordination .",
    "[ phona ]    as the doping decreases to @xmath53 , the 155  @xmath5 o(4 ) mode softens and decreases in strength , while the mode at 148  @xmath5 hardens slightly , and gains strength . below @xmath53 ,",
    "it is clear that the fundamental nature of this mode has changed ; the 155 @xmath5 feature hardens dramatically , and loses almost all of its oscillator strength ; in contrast , the 148 @xmath5 mode softens , and its oscillator strength approaches the value of the 155 @xmath5 mode in the highly - doped material .",
    "the 312  @xmath5 plane - oxygen mode displays drastically different behavior at room temperature and at 10  k. at room temperature , the mode hardens from 315  @xmath5 to 320 @xmath5 and its oscillator strength remains unchanged as the doping is reduced .",
    "however , at 10  k , this mode softens dramatically with decreasing doping , furthermore , at @xmath54 this mode , at low temperature , has lost most of its considerable oscillator strength .",
    "the loss of oscillator strength at low temperature in the underdoped materials results from the transfer of their spectral weight to the 400 @xmath5 mode , which will be discussed in more detail below .    in the fully - oxygenated material",
    "the 610  @xmath5 mode can just be seen as a weak side band of the 570  @xmath5 mode , but as the doping is reduced the 610  @xmath5 grows substantially in spectral weight .",
    "the mode hardens substantially to 645  @xmath5 in the @xmath12 material , while the 570  @xmath5 mode that it is associated with is steadily losing oscillator strength with decreasing doping .",
    "this effect has been attributed by burns et al . to the shortening of the o(4)-cu(1 ) bond by 6% in the same concentration range @xcite . in rough agreement with this model the 610",
    "@xmath5 line changes its frequency by 6% as well in the same concentration range . in burns picture",
    "the 570 @xmath5 line arising from the o(4 ) at the four - fold coordinated copper , _ softens _ by 3% , a value typical of the overall _",
    "c_-axis expansion , suggesting a _ lengthening _ of that bond .",
    "if the interpretation of burns is correct we would expect a modulation of the o(4 ) position in the _ a_-direction by approximately 0.03    ( 1    @xmath55  m ) in the ortho  ii structure where there is an alternation between two- and four - fold coordinated coppers .",
    "there have been reports , by several authors @xcite , of a double peak in the cu(1)o(4 ) bond length distribution measured by xafs by as much as 0.1   .",
    "[ phonb ]    the widths of the phonons increase steadily with decreasing doping , with the exception of the 155  @xmath5 mode , which shows some signs of narrowing at low dopings .",
    "the steadily increasing widths may be a reflection of the o(1)-site disorder at low dopings .",
    "however , if there is some long - range ordering of the o(1 ) sites at low dopings , as is expected in the ortho  ii phase , then there should be some narrowing observed in the lines .",
    "while there is some evidence of this in the 155  @xmath5 mode , the 279 @xmath5 mode shows no signs of narrowing at low - oxygen dopings .",
    "the oscillator strengths are a convenient guide by which to follow the effects of the removal of oxygen from the o(1 ) sites .",
    "in particular , this is true for the 279  @xmath5 mode , which is almost exclusively an o(1)-oxygen vibration . in the @xmath12 material , we expect that the o(1 ) sites should be half empty . at 295  k ,",
    "the effective - plasma frequency of this mode decreases from @xmath56 @xmath5 to @xmath57 @xmath5 in the @xmath12 material ; taking the nave view that the ratio of the oscillator strengths ( @xmath58 ) of 0.44 should be a reflection of the half - empty occupancy of the o(1 ) sites , we find good agreement .",
    "the asymmetric line shapes of the 570 and 610  @xmath5 modes require that they be fitted using a rotated lorentzian .",
    "while this line shape generally satisfies oscillator sum rules for small rotations , it has been pointed out that for large rotations ( @xmath59 rad ) this is no longer true .",
    "the values for @xmath60 may generally have increasingly large errors associated with them for large rotations .",

    "the sharpness of the phonons in the highly - doped phase , especially at the low frequency modes at 155 and 279 @xmath5 , where anharmonic contribution to the width is small , is a sign of good crystal quality . in previous single crystal work with polished samples",

    "the most striking change at room temperature with doping , is the growth of the 610  @xmath5 mode at the expense of the 570  @xmath5 mode .",
    "this 610  @xmath5 feature has been observed in other work and has been the subject of some controversy , since there is lack of agreement in the raman community on the presence of the corresponding raman mode at 600 @xmath5 @xcite . in the tetrahedral yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath62 material , which lacks the o(1 ) oxygen chains , there is an infrared active @xmath79 mode that is observed at @xmath80  @xmath5 which , like the 573 @xmath5 mode in the orthorhombic phase , has been identified with the o(4 ) oxygen @xcite . in removing the chain oxygens ,",
    "the four - fold coordinated cu(1 ) `` squares '' become two - fold coordinated `` sticks '' @xcite .",
    "the change in coordination number is accompanied by a decrease in the cu(1)o(4 ) distance , and a resulting hardening of the mode causing it to move from 570 to 610 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the feature at @xmath27 @xmath5 therefore appears to be an @xmath79 mode native to the tetrahedral phase involving the o(4)cu(1)o(4 ) sticks .    in accord with this picture",
    "we find that the oscillator strength of the two modes , at 570 and 610  @xmath5 , are nearly identical in the @xmath81 material .",
    "one expects the ideal ortho  ii structure to occur at @xmath50 where there are an equal number of two and four - fold coordinated coppers with every other chain complete and every other chain empty .",
    "also , the temperature dependence of the various mode parameters seen in fig .  [ phonb ] , is nearly identical for the two modes confirming that they are located on nearly identical structural units .",
    "some recent raman work does show intensity variation with doping that parallels our work with weakening of the 500  @xmath5 line as the 600 @xmath5 line grows .",
    "the two lines reach lines of equal strength at 500 and 600 @xmath5 in the oxygen reduced , @xmath82 material .",
    "surprisingly , this is observed for the @xmath83 polarization .",
    "neutron measurements , too , find a mode in oxygen - reduced material @xmath84 at @xmath85 at the frequency that is consistent with burns model of a high frequency mode for two - fold coordinated cu(1 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that the neutron density of states determined by incoherent scattering shows a high frequency band of modes in the @xmath86 phase centered at 650 @xmath5 , whereas the fully - doped material has its highest branch at @xmath87 @xmath5 @xcite , in accord with the notion of a set of high - frequency modes associated with the oxygen - reduced material .",
    "another trend with decreasing doping is the appearance and growth of a broad band at @xmath7 @xmath5 at low temperature .",
    "the band also shifts to lower frequencies as the doping is reduced . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma10 ] and in fig .",
    "[ lump ] , this unusual feature increases in strength in the normal state as the temperature is lowered , but does not show anomalous behavior at @xmath6 . at very low dopings , ( @xmath88 ) where this band is quite strong , it appears to gain oscillator strength at the expense of the 312 , 570 , and 610 @xmath5 phonons . at room temperature where the phonons are sharp and well defined , the total spectral weight of the in the @xmath89  @xmath5 range , is equal to the total spectral weight , including the 400 @xmath5 mode , at low temperature .",
    "this conservation of spectral weight is consistent with the idea that the broad peak at @xmath7 @xmath5 is indeed a phonon .",
    "the broad , weak mode at @xmath90 @xmath5 has been observed in ceramic spectra of samples that appear to have been oxygen reduced @xcite , but this mode does not correspond to any of the calculated @xmath4 normal modes @xcite .",
    "a similar mode is seen in yba@xmath0cu@xmath91o@xmath92 @xcite as well as in pb@xmath0sr@xmath0rcu@xmath1o@xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the common element in the three compounds is the third copper layer with two - fold coordinated oxygen bonds . in all three systems the mode appears at low temperature , growing in strength at the expense of both in - plane mode at 312 @xmath5 as well as the two apical - oxygen modes .",
    "this behavior suggests that an unusual transition is taking place that involves several atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the transition may be related to the zone - boundary mode reported on by reichardt et al .",
    "@xcite ; located at approximately 400 @xmath5 , it was found to be anomalously broad and involved the `` breathing '' motions of the ions around the planar copper .",
    "this mode is not normally infrared active , but could become so as a result of some symmetry - breaking process .",
    "the mode involves the _",
    "c_-axis motion of the o(4 ) , but not the in - plane motion of the planar oxygens .",
    "its invocation would explain only half of our observations , namely the loss of o(4 ) spectral weight to the new mode through an electron - phonon process of the type discussed in connection with organic molecules by rice @xcite .",
    "in such a process a symmetry - breaking transformation allows totally - symmetric vibrations ( here the zone - boundary breathing mode ) to become optically active .",
    "a necessary ingredient of the process is the presence of low - lying charge - transfer bands .",
    "the excess spectral weight and the asymmetric shape of the o(4 ) bands suggests that charge is being pumped at the o(4 ) frequency between chains and planes .",
    "this process is already active at high temperature above the formation temperature of the pseudogap .",
    "it would then not be unreasonable to anticipate that when the symmetry - breaking transition sets in at 150 k in the oxygen - reduced materials , that some of this phonon - driven charge is transferred from the o(4 ) and plane modes , to the newly activated breathing mode .",
    "the difficulty with this argument is that it is does not apply to the other two compounds where this mode is observed @xcite .",
    "possibly related to this unusual phonon , polarized in the c - direction , is the phenomenon in the _",
    "ab_-plane conductivity reported on by reedyk and timusk where , in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath47 the _",
    "c_-axis longitudinal modes interacted strongly with the _ ab_-plane conductivity @xcite .",
    "the strongest of these was a broad phonon with the longitudinal frequency of 440 @xmath5 .",
    "the structural transition giving rise to the phonon at @xmath7 @xmath5 band appears to be related to the pseudogap seen at @xmath93 @xmath5 in underdoped materials .",
    "it is strong in underdoped materials where the pseudogap is also well developed . in zn - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath91o@xmath92 , both the pseudogap and",
    "the 400  @xmath5 mode disappear at a 1.7% doping level .",
    "however , there are some differences . whereas the pseudogap appears gradually , in case of the @xmath16 material at a temperature well above 300  k , the 400  @xmath5 band forms quite suddenly at @xmath8  k , as shown by the sudden loss of o(4 ) spectral weight below this temperature .    in summary , at this stage",
    "we have only the vaguest understanding of the nature of the phonons giving rise to the band at 400  @xmath5 , it is a feature that appears at low temperature in oxygen - reduced materials only , and gets its oscillator strength from plane - buckling and the o(4 ) modes .",
    "its frequency coincides with the anomalous broad mode seen in neutron scattering , and a broad minimum in the _ ab_-plane conductivity .",
    "zn doping of yba@xmath0cu@xmath91o@xmath94 seems to interfere with the formation of this mode .",
    "it should be noted that it is not the result of a simple structural transition , since the _ frequencies _ of the modes involved change little ; there is no soft - mode behavior .",
    "it appears that the transition is electronic in nature , the main result being the shift of effective charges of the phonons , not their frequencies .",
    "the phonons in the oxygen - reduced systems provide a richly detailed structure . at high dopings , there are five strong @xmath4 modes . at low dopings ( @xmath95 ) , many of the lines split into a number of different components . in particular , the high - frequency apical - oxygen mode splits into two components ; the low - frequency component is associated with the four - fold coordinated copper atom , and the high - frequency component with the two - fold coordinated copper .",
    "what is most unusual is the development of a broad feature , centered at @xmath7  @xmath5 .",
    "this feature , attributed to a ( unknown ) phonon , becomes more pronounced as oxygen is removed from the system ; it grows in strength as the temperature is lowered , appearing to draw oscillator strength from the vibrations at @xmath96 , 570 and 610  @xmath5 with decreasing temperature .",
    "this behavior develops well above @xmath6 , and other phonon anomalies are seen in the @xmath28 material at @xmath8  k.    since these massive shifts of spectral weight to the 400  @xmath5 mode are not seen in other high - temperature superconductors , such as la@xmath97sr@xmath98cuo@xmath91 and bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath99 @xcite , they may be related to some special structural property of materials with a third copper layer in the charge reservoir area of the unit cell , and not a fundamental property of the cuprates .",
