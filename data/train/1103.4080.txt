    "in recent years pedestrian dynamics has gained more importance and a lot of attention due to continuously growing urban population and cities combined with an increase of mass events .",
    "this sets new challenges to architects , urban planners and organizers of mass events .",
    "one of the main goals is an effective use of the designed facility , for instance by minimizing jams thereby optimizing the traffic flow . in this context pedestrian simulations",
    "are already used , e.g. for escape route design @xcite .",
    "however the approaches used in these simulations are only the first step to model the manifold influences on human beings during an evacuation process .",
    "major issues in this area include orientation and way finding : given a set of possible routes , which criteria influence pedestrians choice for a particular route ?",
    "this is essential for reproducing route choice in computer models and is difficult due to the many underlying subjective influences on this choice .",
    "the manner by which pedestrians choose their way has a direct influence not only on the overall evacuation time but also on the average time pedestrians spend in a jam . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case where pedestrians all have the same motivation , to leave the facility .    the approaches of modelling pedestrians motion fall into two main groups : microscopic and macroscopic models .",
    "microscopic models are further categorized in spatially discrete ( e.g. cellular automata @xcite ) and spatially continuous models ( e.g. social force model @xcite , generalized centrifugal force model @xcite ) . for a detailed overview",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "ca models use floor fields ( static and/or dynamic ) to direct pedestrians to a destination point .",
    "route choice in continuous models can be achieved by means of a network which consists of a set of destination points .",
    "this type of way finding is known as graph - based routing @xcite .",
    "the destination points can be pre - determined ( exits for instance ) or adjustable ( crossings , turning point at the end of a corridor for instance ) .",
    "the minimal network is usually a a visibility graph ( see @xcite for more details ) which ensures that any location on the facility is within the visibility range of at least one node .",
    "the initial network can be refined by adding more adjustable points converging to ca @xcite .",
    "this graph can be extended to a navigation graph by adding more adjustable points .",
    "the generation of such graph is a complex process , some efficient methods are presented in @xcite .",
    "once built the shortest path is usually determined using well established algorithms such as dijkstra @xcite or floyd warshall @xcite .",
    "such networks are widely spread in motion planning by robots as well .",
    "the intrinsic behaviour of humans in the case of an evacuation is generally to follow the seemingly ( self estimated ) quickest path .",
    "this is indeed a subjective notion as it depends on some prerequisites , e.g. whether or not the pedestrian is familiar with the facility .",
    "the modelling of the quickest path is achieved by systematically avoiding congestions . in ca",
    "this is achieved by means of dynamic floor fields @xcite where pedestrians moving increase the probability of using that path thereby making it more attractive for other pedestrians .",
    "this implicitly leads to congestion avoidance .",
    "the density in front of the moving pedestrians within their sight range is also considered @xcite as well as the payload at exits @xcite ; other approaches include navigation fields @xcite .",
    "continuous models usually optimize the travel time in the constructed network . in @xcite , pedestrians minimize their travel time by solving the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation yielding to the optimal pedestrians path at each time step .",
    "a combination of a graph - based routing with ca is presented in @xcite where the fastest path for pedestrians is computed using a heuristic @xmath0 algorithm @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "an event driven way finding in a graph - based structure is introduced .",
    "the approach is based on an observation principle , pedestrians observe their environment and take their final decision based on the obtained data . with this observation",
    "the quickest path is achieved .",
    "the modelled strategies are the local shortest path ( lsp ) , the global shortest path ( gsp ) , the local shortest combined with the quickest path ( lsq ) and finally the global shortest combined with the quickest path ( gsq ) .",
    "an important point less discussed is given by the criticality of an evacuation process , first and foremost the meaning of criticality for an evacuation process .",
    "evaluation criteria like the building itself , the population size and the initial distribution of the evacuees , the evacuation time are discussed in @xcite .",
    "more individual criteria like the individual travel time and waiting time are investigated in @xcite .",
    "the most used criteria are the overall evacuation time and a visualisation of the evacuation process at specific times . in this paper",
    "we elaborate other criteria to address the criticality of an evacuation simulation .",
    "the analysed criteria are the individual time spent in jam , the jam size evolution over time and the total jam size defined as the area under the jam size evolution .",
    "we give a special credit to the time pedestrians spend in jam as well as the jam size .",
    "this is of particular importance . in the case of the hermes project @xcite , there are congestions that vary ( in place and size ) depending on the type of people attending the events .",
    "we try to reproduce this observed phenomenon for the forecast of the evacuation dynamic . in order to achieve this",
    ", route choice has to be individually modelled .",
    "those events involve pedestrians familiar and unfamiliar with the facility .",
    "the four previously mentioned strategies are proposed to reproduce their route choice .",
    "their influences on the previous mentioned criteria are investigated .",
    "the modelling approaches are presented in the second section .",
    "the third section describes the evacuation assessment criteria .",
    "the analysis of the results including simulation , distribution of the evacuation time and distribution of the individual times spent in jam using different initial conditions are discussed in the fourth section .",
    "the framework used for describing pedestrian traffic can be divided in a three - tiers structure .",
    "one distinguishes between the strategic , the tactical and the operational level @xcite . in our model the operational level of the pedestrian walking is described by the generalized centrifugal force model @xcite which operates in continuous space . in this model pedestrians are described by ellipses .",
    "the semi - axes of the ellipses are velocity dependent , faster ellipses need more space in the moving direction .",
    "the fundamental diagram is reproduced by the model at corridors making it adequate for the analysis presented here . in this paper",
    "we focus on the strategic level only , i.e. the pedestrians are solely given the next destination point , which is the next intermediate destination for the self estimated optimal route .",
    "this is also the direction of the driven force .",
    "we simulate pedestrians that are familiar with the facility and pedestrians unfamiliar with the facility .",
    "for those two groups we identify criteria to reproduce their route choice .",
    "those criteria are the local / global shortest path and the quickest path .",
    "the dynamic change of the strategies is modelled .",
    "this emulates the internal state of the pedestrians and the strategies are subject to change during the evacuation process .",
    "in addition one of the challenges consists of finding a good balance between the number of parameters and the numbers of criteria .",
    "the model should be as simple as possible with the parameter space kept as small as possible while considering as many criteria as required .",
    "this is important for model understanding and stability .    in the framework",
    "used here , pedestrians move from one decision area to the next one .",
    "the decision areas are connected with nodes , which will be interchangeable with destination points .",
    "a decision area is a place where the pedestrian decides which way to go or change their current destination . in this work",
    "a decision area is an abstraction for rooms and corridors , in addition we restrict ourselves to the case where the destination points are exits and corridors end .",
    "[ fig : decision_area ] illustrates this principle and is a mapping of the facility presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : reference_selection ] .",
    "the pedestrians will be moving from the decision area 1 to the decision area 2 .",
    "the two areas are connected with one node @xmath1 .",
    "the network is automatically generated from the facility based on the inter - visibility of the exits .",
    "the euclidean distance between the nodes is used as weights .",
    "the most straight - forward routing approach is the local shortest path .",
    "once a node in the network is reached , the local nearest node is chosen as next destination .",
    "the global shortest path is determined by running the floyd warshall algorithm with path reconstruction @xcite on the built graph network .",
    "the runtime of @xmath2 is not an issue since we only have a small amount of nodes . from every node on the graph",
    ", the global shortest path to reach the outside can be determined .",
    "pedestrians familiar with the facility have the global map i.e. the constructed network and may approximate the global shortest path to their final destination independently of their current location .",
    "they have a better analysis possibility of the current situation .",
    "other pedestrians without any global information choose the local shortest path .",
    "in contrast to the shortest path , the quickest path is dynamic and changes with time throughout the simulation .",
    "the business logic of the routing algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quickest_path ] .",
    "the main events used in this routing algorithm to redirect pedestrians are the entering a new room and the identification of a jam situation .",

    "the key elements of a quickest path routing approach are the estimation of the travel time , the estimation of the gain and an assessment of this gain .",

    "<S> this paper presents an event - driven way finding algorithm for pedestrians in an evacuation scenario , which operates on a graph - based structure . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility . </S>",
    "<S> the events used to redirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or identification of a better route than the current . </S>",
    "<S> this study considers two types of pedestrians : familiar and unfamiliar with the facility . </S>",
    "<S> four strategies are modelled to cover those groups . </S>",
    "<S> the modelled strategies are the shortest path ( local and global ) ; they are combined with a quickest path approach , which is based on an observation principle . in the quickest path approach , </S>",
    "<S> pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment and are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit analysis function . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamic modelling of route choice with different strategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of influences which appears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an evacuation process . to address this question criteria </S>",
    "<S> are elaborated . </S>",
    "<S> the criteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time , the individual times spent in jam , the jam size evolution and the overall jam size itself . </S>",
    "<S> the influences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the sensibility of the system to disturbances ( e.g. broken escape route ) is also analysed .    </S>",
