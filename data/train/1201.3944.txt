    "recently , antihydrogen ( @xmath0 ) atoms were trapped in the alpha apparatus at cern @xcite .",
    "the ability to discriminate between trapped antihydrogen and incidentally trapped antiprotons was crucial to proving that antihydrogen was actually trapped @xcite .",
    "the antihydrogen was trapped in a magnetic minimum @xcite created by an octupole magnet which produced fields of @xmath1 at the trap wall at @xmath2 , and two mirror coils which produced fields of @xmath3 at their centers at @xmath4 .",
    "the relative orientation of these coils and the trap boundaries are shown in figure  [ apparatus ] .",
    "these fields were superimposed on a uniform axial field of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fields thus increased from about @xmath5 at the trap center ( @xmath6 ) , to @xmath7 at the trap axial ends ( @xmath8 , @xmath4 ) , and to @xmath9 on the trap wall at ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "is field from the mirrors at @xmath11 . ]",
    "antihydrogen was trapped in this minimum because of the interaction of its magnetic moment with the inhomogeneous field .",
    "ground state antihydrogen with a properly aligned spin is a low field seeker ; as its motion is slow enough that its spin does not flip , the antihydrogen is pushed back towards the trap center by a force @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total magnetic field , and @xmath14 is the antihydrogen magnetic moment .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetic moment for ground state antihydrogen is small ; the trap depth in the alpha apparatus is only @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is used as an energy unit .    .",
    "the components are not drawn to scale.,width=240 ]    trapped antihydrogen was identified by quickly turning off the superconducting octupole and mirror magnetic field coils .",
    "any antihydrogen present in the trap was then released onto the trap walls , where it annihilated .",
    "the temporal and spatial coordinates of such annihilations were recorded by a vertex imaging particle detector @xcite .",
    "the detector is sensitive only to the charged particles produced by antiproton annihilations ; it can not detect the gamma rays from positron annihilations .",
    "thus , it can not directly discriminate between antihydrogen and any bare antiprotons that might also be trapped .",
    "we must use additional means to prove that a candidate observation ( event ) results from an antihydrogen annihilation .",
    "bare antiprotons can be trapped by the octupole and mirror fields because they may be reflected , or mirrored @xcite , by the increasing field as they propagate away from the trap center .",
    "antiprotons obey the lorentz force , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unit charge , @xmath19 is the antiproton velocity , and @xmath20 is the electric field , if any , present in the trap . in our circumstances ,",
    "the antiprotons generally satisfy the guiding center approximation requirements @xcite . temporarily ignoring @xmath20 ,",
    "the force law for the antiprotons reduces to one similar to that for antihydrogen , ( [ restoreforcehbar ] ) , @xmath21 with the antiproton perpendicular magnetic moment @xmath22 replacing @xmath14 in ( [ restoreforcehbar ] ) , and with the additional constraint that the antiprotons follow the magnetic field lines , slowly progressing between lines as dictated by the other guiding center drifts . here , @xmath23 , @xmath22 is aligned antiparallel to @xmath13 , and @xmath24 is the antiproton kinetic energy perpendicular to @xmath13 .",
    "because @xmath25 is adiabatically conserved , antiprotons can be trapped if their parallel energy is exhausted as they propagate outwards from the trap center .",
    "the trapping condition comes from the well - known magnetic mirror equation , @xmath26 which defines the largest total magnetic field @xmath27 to which an antiproton that starts at the trap center can propagate .",
    "here , @xmath28 is the total magnetic field magnitude at the trap center , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the antiproton s kinetic energies perpendicular and parallel to the total magnetic field at the trap center . using ( [ mirrorfield ] ) , we can readily define the critical antiproton trapping energy ratio @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the smallest total magnetic field magnitude on the region of the trap wall accessible from the trap center .",
    "is the lesser of the total magnetic field at the trap wall or the total magnetic field on the trap axis directly underneath the mirror . in our case , the former is lower . ]",
    "an antiproton will be trapped if its ratio of @xmath33 exceeds @xmath34 , i.e. , if its perpendicular energy is large compared to its parallel energy .    a typical antihydrogen synthesis cycle @xcite starts with 15,00030,000 antiprotons trapped in an electrostatic well , and several million positrons trapped in a nearby electrostatic well of opposite curvature .",
    "this configuration is called a double well penning - malmberg trap ; the electrostatic wells provide axial confinement , and the aforementioned axial magnetic field provides radial confinement .",
    "the antiprotons come from cern s antiproton decelerator ( ad ) @xcite , and the positrons from a surko - style @xcite positron accumulator .",
    "the reader is referred elsewhere @xcite for the details of the trap operation ; we will here discuss only those aspects of the trap operation relevant to discriminating between antiprotons and antihydrogen .",
    "about one third of the antiprotons convert to antihydrogen on mixing with positrons @xcite .",
    "some of these antihydrogen atoms hit the trap wall and annihilate .",
    "others are ionized by collisions with the remaining positrons or antiprotons @xcite , or by the strong electric fields present in mixing region @xcite , and turn back into bare antiprotons ( and positrons ) .",
    "only a very few antiatoms are trapped at the end of the mixing cycle , and confined with these few are approximately 10,00020,000 bare antiprotons .",
    "if these antiprotons were isotropically distributed in velocity , it is easy to show by integrating over the distribution that the fraction that would be trapped by the octupole and mirror fields alone once the electrostatic fields are turned off is : @xmath35 since @xmath36 for our magnet system , 65% , of an isotropically distributed population of antiprotons would be trapped . , is greater for antiprotons that originate elsewhere , so , for such antiprotons , the trapping fraction would be less . ]",
    "the actual distribution of the bare antiprotons is unknown and likely not isotropic .",
    "nevertheless , if any fraction of these antiprotons were actually present in the trap when the magnets are shut off , the signal from these antiprotons would overwhelm the signal from any trapped antihydrogen .",
    "thus , our goal is two - fold : ( 1 ) in the experiment , to eliminate the trapped antiprotons if possible , and ( 2 ) in the analysis , to be able to discriminate between trapped antihydrogen and any mirror - trapped antiprotons that might have survived the elimination procedures .    in section  [ simulations ] of this paper",
    ", we describe the numeric simulations that we used to investigate these issues . in section  [ pbarclearing ]",
    ", we describe how we apply large electric fields which clear all antiprotons with kinetic energy less than about @xmath37 . in section  [ pbargeneration ]",
    "we consider the various mechanisms that could result in mirror - trapped antiprotons with this much energy and conclude that few , if any , antiprotons are trapped . in section  [ benchmarking ]",
    "we describe experiments which benchmark the antiproton simulations , and in section  [ hbardist ] we discuss the postulated antiproton energy distribution .",
    "finally , in section  [ trappingexperiments ] , we employ simulations to show that if any mirror - trapped antiprotons were to survive the clearing processes , they would annihilate with very different temporal and spatial characteristics than do minimum - b trapped antihydrogen atoms .",
    "in this section , we first describe how we calculate the electric and magnetic fields present in the apparatus , including the effects of eddy currents while the magnets are being turned off ( shutdown ) .",
    "then we describe the simulation codes that use these fields to determine the antiproton and antihydrogen trajectories .",
    "electric fields are generated in the trap by imposing different potentials on the trap electrodes ( see figure  [ apparatus ] ) . in the simulations ,",
    "these fields are determined by finite difference methods .",
    "two independent calculations were undertaken .",
    "the first , and the one used in the majority of the simulations , was hand coded and used a slightly simplified model of the electrode mechanical structure ; the second was obtained using the comsol multiphysics package @xcite and an exact model of the electrode mechanical structure . when the calculations were compared , the largest differences in the potentials were near the gaps between the electrodes at the trap wall .",
    "these differences reflected the handling of the computational grid near the electrode gaps .",
    "the largest potential energy differences were more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the antiproton energy scale .",
    "away from the electrode gaps , these differences were more than four orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the annihilation location statistics that result from the two finite difference calculations agree within @xmath38 fluctuations .",
    "four magnetic field coils , a solenoid , two mirrors and an octupole , produce the fields modeled in the simulations .",
    "( a fifth coil present in the experiment , a solenoid which boosts the magnetic field during the antiproton catching phase , is not energized during the times studied in the simulations . )",
    "no simple analytic expressions for the field from these coils exist because their windings possess an appreciable cross - sectional area and are of finite length .",
    "consequently , we use the biot - savart numeric integrator found in the tosca / opera3d field solver package @xcite to generate a three - dimensional magnetic field map @xcite .",
    "granulation issues make the direct use of this map problematic in our particle stepper , so we use the map to find the parameters of an analytic model of the vector magnetic potential , @xmath39 , from which we then derive the field .",
    "using this analytic expression for @xmath39 is computationally efficient , requires little memory , and eliminates the granulation issues . over most of the particle - accessible space",
    "the fields derived from @xmath39 are an excellent match to the numeric fields ; the deviation between the numeric and analytic fields is never greater than about 2% , and is this large only near the axial ends of the octupole where particles rarely reach .",
    "however , while the fields derived from @xmath39 satisfy @xmath40 exactly , they do not quite satisfy @xmath41 , and require the existence of unphysical currents , principally near the mirror coils .",
    "these currents are very small ; over the majority of the trap , the unphysical current densities are more than four orders of magnitude lower than the typical current densities in the mirror coils . even near the wall under the mirror coils where the unphysical current densities are largest , they are still more than two orders of magnitude lower than the typical current densities in the mirror coils . to further test the validity of this analytic calculation of @xmath13",
    ", we studied the distribution of annihilation locations with a computationally slower , but more accurate @xmath13 found via the biot - savart line integral methodology .",
    "since none of these studies showed statistically significant differences in the antiproton annihilation location distributions , we used the faster analytic calculation of @xmath42 throughout this paper .",
    "routines to calculate @xmath39 and @xmath13 were implemented independently in two different computer languages .",
    "the results of the two implementations were each checked against the numeric field map and against each other .",
    "the details of the calculation of @xmath39 are given in [ magneticfield ] .",
    "an important advantage of the vector magnetic potential formulation is that it makes it trivial to calculate the electric field induced by the decaying magnetic field during the magnet shutdowns .",
    "this electric field , given by @xmath43 , plays a key role in antiproton dynamics as it is responsible for conserving the third ( area ) adiabatic invariant @xcite .",
    "the steady - state coil currents are measured to 1% accuracy , and this sets the accuracy to which the fields are known . during the magnet shutdown ,",
    "the coil currents decay in a near exponential fashion with measured time constants near @xmath44 .",
    "( in the simulations , we use the measured coil current decays to capture the small deviations from exponential decay .",
    ") however , the changing magnetic field induces currents in the trap electrodes which retard the decay of the field .",
    "we have found these decay currents using the comsol multiphysics package @xcite and a precise model of the electrode mechanical structure .",
    "the eddy currents depend on the resistivity of the 6082 aluminum from which the electrodes are fabricated .",
    "this resistivity is @xmath45 at room temperature , and is reduced , at cryogenic temperatures , by the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) , which we measured to be 3.06 .",
    "we find that the eddy currents delay the decay of the magnetic field in a manner well - modeled by passing the coil - created magnetic field through a single - pole low pass filter ; the filter time constants are @xmath46 for the mirror coils and @xmath47 for the octupole field .",
    "the eddy currents have more influence on the mirror fields than the octupole fields because the breaks between the electrodes do not interrupt the largely azimuthal currents induced by the mirrors , but do interrupt the largely axial currents induced by the octupole .",
    "the simulations employ these filters to model the effects of the eddy currents .",
    "the antiproton simulations push particles in response to the lorentz force ( [ lorentzequation ] ) using the fields of section  [ fields ] .",
    "two codes were developed .",
    "the first and primary code propagates the full lorentz force equations for the position @xmath48 and velocity @xmath19 using the boris method @xcite @xmath49\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\mathbf{v}(t+\\delta t)+\\mathbf{v}(t)}{2 } \\times\\mathbf{b}[\\mathbf{r}(t+\\frac{\\delta t}{2 } ) , t+\\frac{\\delta t}{2}]\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the antiproton position .",
    "this algorithm is an order @xmath50 method for a single timestep @xmath51 .",
    "it conserves the perpendicular energy exactly in a uniform , static field ; this is particularly important as the simulations must conserve @xmath25 adiabatically .",
    "the second code uses guiding center approximations , including @xmath52 , curvature , and grad - b drifts , and propagates particles using an adaptive runge - kutta stepper .",
    "the results of the two codes were compared , and no significant differences were observed .",
    "typical antiproton trajectories are described in [ pbarorbits ] .",
    "the antihydrogen simulations pushed particles in response to ( [ restoreforcehbar ] ) in the fields of section  [ fields ] .",
    "two adaptive runge - kutta stepper codes were developed independently and the results compared .",
    "no significant differences were observed .",
    "in addition , the usual convergence tests of the simulation results as a function of the time step were satisfactorily performed .",
    "similar tests were also performed for the antiproton simulations .",
    "typical antihydrogen atom trajectories are described in [ hbarorbits ] .",
    "immediately after a mixing cycle , we axially `` dump '' the antiprotons and positrons onto beamstops where they annihilate .",
    "the dumps use a series of electric field pulses , and are designed to facilitate counting of the charged particles .",
    "they employ relatively weak electric fields .",
    "( we switched from an `` original '' dump sequence to an `` improved , '' more efficient , dump sequence midway through the runs reported in this paper . ) after the dumps , all the electrodes are grounded ; any antiprotons that still remain in the trap must be trapped by the mirror and octupole fields alone .",
    "the magnitude of the mirror fields is plotted in figure  [ pseudopotgraph]a .",
    "next , we attempt to `` clear '' any such mirror - trapped antiprotons with a series of four clearing cycles .",
    "these clearing cycles use much larger electric fields than the dump pulses ; there are two initial `` weak '' clears , and two final `` strong '' clears .",
    "the electrostatic potentials used in the strong clears are graphed as @xmath53 and @xmath54 in figure  [ pseudopotgraph]a ; the weak clear fields are half as large as the strong clear fields .    , and the electrostatic potential energy of an antiproton in the strong clearing fields at times @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "b ) the pseudopotential ( [ pseudopot ] ) for antiprotons with perpendicular energy @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . a well exists in the pseudopotential only for @xmath60 . ]",
    "a mirror - trapped antiproton can be thought to move in a pseudopotential @xmath61 which combines the electrostatic potential with an effective potential which derives from the invariance of @xmath25 , @xmath62 for simplicity , we consider @xmath61 on the @xmath63 axis only",
    ". figure  [ pseudopotgraph]b plots the pseudopotential for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath59 .",
    "for an antiproton to be trapped , a well must exist in the pseudopotential .",
    "this condition , which is a function of the perpendicular energy @xmath29 only , replaces the prior trapping condition , @xmath66 in the presence of an electric field . for our parameters , a well only develops for antiprotons with @xmath60 .",
    "any antiproton with @xmath67 will necessarily be expelled from the system by the strong clear field even if it has @xmath68 .",
    "it might appear that antiprotons with @xmath69 would be trapped .",
    "but figure  [ pseudopotgraph]b shows the static pseudopotential ; in the experiment , the clearing field swings from the potential shown in figure  [ pseudopotgraph]a at time @xmath55 to the potential at time @xmath56 and back eight times ( the first four swings , during the weak clears , are at half voltage ) .",
    "each of these eight stages lasts @xmath70 .",
    "extensive computer simulation studies show that these swings expel all antiprotons with @xmath71 .",
    "two such studies are shown in figure  [ eperpsurvive ] .",
    "the simulations are initiated with a postulated antiproton distribution before the clears .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know this distribution experimentally ( see section  [ pbargeneration ] ) , so we use two trial distributions that cover the plausible possibilities : both distributions assume a spatially uniform antiproton density throughout the trap region but differ in their velocity distribution .",
    "distribution  1 has a velocity distribution that is isotropic and flat up to a total energy of @xmath72 , while distribution  2 has a velocity distribution that is isotropic and thermal with a temperature of @xmath73 .",
    "note that these distributions are intended to reveal the properties of antiprotons that could survive the clears .",
    "they are not intended to be representative of ( and , in fact , are thought to be far more extreme than ) the actual antiprotons in the trap .    for both distributions ,",
    "less than 2% of the antiprotons survive the clearing cycles and remain in the trap , and all that survive have @xmath74 .",
    "further , those with @xmath74 are only trapped if they have very little @xmath75 , as not much parallel energy is needed for them to surmount the relatively shallow pseudopotential wells .",
    "for example , in figure  [ pseudopotgraph]b , the potential well for antiprotons with @xmath76 is only about @xmath77 deep .",
    "the improved efficacy of the time - dependent clearing cycles over the static clearing potential comes from two factors : 1 ) the repeated voltage swings accelerate the antiprotons , in some cases non - adiabatically .",
    "this often gives them sufficient parallel energy to escape .",
    "2 ) the potentials depicted in figure  [ pseudopotgraph]a are generated by voltages impressed on 21 electrodes .",
    "four central electrodes have a significantly slower temporal response than the outer electrodes ; this creates a momentary well that lifts and eventually dumps antiprotons with increased parallel energy , again raising the likelihood that they escape .",
    "we monitor the antiproton losses in our experiments during the clearing cycles ( see table  [ clearsurvivetable ] . ) with the original dumps , a substantial number of antiprotons escape in the first clear . a few antiprotons escape during the second and third clears , but , to the statistical significance of the measurement , none escape in the last clear . with the improved dumps ,",
    "far fewer escape in the first clear , a few , perhaps , in the second and third , and none in the last .",
    "it is telling that there is no upwards jump in the number that escape between the second and third clears ( between the last weak and the first strong clear ) , as this lack suggests that there is no continuous distribution of antiprotons with a significant population with energies between @xmath78 , which are cleared by the weak clears alone , and @xmath76 , which are cleared by the strong clears .",
    "thus , in conjunction with the simulations , we conclude that it is not likely that antiprotons with perpendicular energy less than @xmath59 survive the clears and , therefore , none are likely present during the magnet shutdowns .",

    "in this section we will describe three scenarios that could result in the creation of mirror - trapped antiprotons : creation during the initial capture and cooling of antiprotons from the ad ; creation during the mixing of antiprotons into the positrons ; and creation by the ionization of antihydrogen .",
    "we will show that none of these mechanisms are likely to produce mirror - trapped antiprotons with @xmath24 exceeding @xmath37 .",
    "however , the calculations are sufficiently uncertain that they can not guarantee that none are created .",
    "instead , we rely on two other arguments : ( 1 ) as will be discussed in section  [ trappingexperiments ] , the temporal - spatial characteristics of the candidate events are not compatible with mirror - trapped antiprotons .",
    "( 2 ) by heating the positron plasma , we can shut off the production of antihydrogen @xcite .",
    "when we do this , we observe essentially no trapped antihydrogen candidates ( one candidate in 246 trials , as opposed to 38 candidates in 335 trials in @xcite ) . the temperature",
    "to which we heat the positrons , approximately @xmath80 , is negligible compared to the energy scales discussed in this section , and would have no effect on any mirror - trapped antiprotons created .",
    "these experiments are described in @xcite and will not be further discussed here . taken together , these arguments allow us to conclude that few , if any , mirror - trapped antiprotons survive to the magnet shutdown stage where they could confound our antihydrogen signal .",
    "the ad @xcite delivers a short pulse of @xmath81 antiprotons to the alpha apparatus .",
    "these antiprotons are passed through a thin metal foil degrader , resulting in a broad antiproton energy distribution .",
    "the slowest of these antiprotons are then captured in a @xmath82 solenoidal field ( eventually reduced to @xmath3 ) by the fast manipulation of the potentials of a @xmath83 electrostatic well @xcite . once captured , about 50% of the antiprotons are cooled to several hundred kelvin by collisions with the electrons in a pure - electron plasma that had been previously loaded into the same well @xcite .",
    "the electrons themselves cool by emitting cyclotron radiation .",
    "the remaining 50% of the antiprotons do not cool : they are trapped on field lines at radii greater than the outer radius of the electron plasma and , thus , do not suffer collisions with the electrons .",
    "these uncooled antiprotons are removed from the trap by decreasing the trap depth to , ultimately , about @xmath84 on the trap axis , corresponding to @xmath85 at the trap wall .",
    "( the trap depth on the axis is less than at the wall because of the finite length to radius ratio , @xmath86 , of the trap electrodes . )",
    "as all of these preparatory steps occur before the neutral trapping fields are erected , any antiproton with @xmath75 exceeding @xmath87 will escape before the neutral trap fields are erected and , thus , will not be mirror trapped .    in principle , there is a remote possibility that a high perpendicular energy ( @xmath74 ) antiproton might be largely outside the electron plasma , so that it is not strongly cooled , but would have a parallel energy sufficiently low [ @xmath88 that it could be trapped in the electrostatic well .",
    "certainly , as shown by srim @xcite calculations , a few antiprotons leave the degrader with such skewed energies . however",
    ", the antiprotons must surmount a @xmath89 blocking barrier to enter the well .",
    "an antiproton could be mirror trapped only if ( 1 ) it possessed a high initial @xmath24 and a high enough @xmath75 so that it could pass over this barrier , and then ( 2 ) underwent one or more collisions that reduced its @xmath75 to less than @xmath87 while leaving its @xmath24 above @xmath59 .",
    "such an evolution is unlikely to result from collisions with electrons as the antiproton - electron mass ratio requires multiple collisions to effect a significant change to the antiproton energy , and such a collision sequence does not favor a skewed distribution .",
    "furthermore , we know experimentally that those antiprotons that do not cool quickly essentially never cool ; lengthening the cooling time beyond some tens of seconds does not significantly increase the fraction of antiprotons that are cooled .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that an antiproton would cool just enough to leave it in a state that could be mirror trapped , but not so much that it cools entirely .    alternatively , the collisions required to leave a mirror - trapped antiproton might be with another antiproton or with a background neutral gas molecule .",
    "the density of these necessarily high radius antiprotons is low , and , if they are to be mirror trapped , their perpendicular and hence total energy is high . the exact parameters to use in an antiproton - antiproton collision calculation are unknown , but , under any scenario , only a few antiproton - antiproton collisions will take place during the @xmath90 cooling time",
    ". for example , for a plausible density of energetic antiprotons of about @xmath91 , the probability that one @xmath92 antiproton would suffer one collision in @xmath90 is approximately @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , only a small fraction of these collisions would leave the antiprotons with the required skewed energy distribution .",
    "the neutral gas density can be estimated from the antiproton annihilation rate , and is on the order of @xmath94 , if , as is likely , the background gas in our cryogenic trap is @xmath95 . and he freeze out ; monatomic h is rare , and there is no source of he . ]",
    "while this yields an antiproton - neutral collision rate that is higher than that for antiproton - antiproton collisions , the collision rate calculated by extensions of the methods in @xcite and @xcite is on the order of a few tens of microhertz per antiproton , making it unlikely ( few @xmath96 ) that an individual antiproton will suffer a collision that will leave it with the energies required to be trapped .",
    "individual antiprotons do not suffer multiple collisions with neutrals on the relevant time scale .",
    "antihydrogen is generated by mixing antiproton and positron plasmas after the neutral trapping fields are erected . by this point in the experimental cycle ,",
    "the two species are cold ; the antiprotons are at temperatures of less than two hundred kelvin , and the positrons are at temperatures less than one hundred kelvin @xcite .",
    "the expected number of antiprotons with an energy exceeding @xmath97 in a thermalized plasma of @xmath98 particles and temperature @xmath99 is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this number is completely negligible for the relevant temperatures .",
    "the antiproton temperature would have to be approximately 200 times greater ( @xmath102 ) for there to be an expected value of one or more antiprotons with energy greater than @xmath37 amongst the @xmath10330,000 antiprotons present in one mixing cycle .",
    "thus , there is no chance that thermalization of the initial antiproton plasma could produce mirror - trapped antiprotons .    during the mixing cycle",
    ", the axial motion of the antiprotons is autoresonantly excited @xcite to ease them out of their electrostatic well and into the positron plasma ( see figure  [ mixingwells]a  b ) ; the antiprotons phase - lock to a weak , downward - frequency - sweeping oscillating potential applied to a nearby electrode .",
    "the autoresonant drive has a maximum potential drop of @xmath104 on the trap axis ( @xmath105 at the wall ) , and there are approximately @xmath106 drive cycles . naively , one might think that there are enough cycles that the drive could excite antiprotons up to the maximum confining potential of @xmath107 on the trap wall .",
    "in reality , the antiprotons phase - lock at near @xmath108 such that the impulse conveyed to the antiprotons on each cycle is small @xcite .",
    "the typical antiproton gains just enough energy to enter the positrons : about @xmath109 on the trap axis when plasma self - fields are included . if , as occasionally happens , an antiproton loses phase - lock , it will gain a limited amount of additional energy stochastically in rough proportion to @xmath110 . further , this is axial energy ; if the antiproton were to somehow gain more than @xmath111 it would be lost immediately unless it had also experienced a sufficient number of collisions to posses substantial perpendicular energy . under no scenario",
    "can the antiproton gain energy close to @xmath37 of perpendicular energy directly from the autoresonant drive .",
    "the autoresonant process injects most of the antiprotons into the positrons , but some are left in the original side well with axial energies up to the electrostatic well depth of about @xmath109 near the trap axis . as mixing progresses , antiproton - antiproton collisions cause additional antiprotons to fall into this side well and into the electrostatic well on the other side of the positron plasma ( see figure  [ mixingwells]c ) . as there is no direct mechanism to transport these antiprotons radially outward @xcite , most will remain at or near their original radius ( between @xmath112 and @xmath113 depending on the details of the procedures in use at the time . )",
    "approximately 50% of the particles eventually fall into the two side wells , so the number of antiprotons in the side wells eventually approaches the un - mixed antiproton number .",
    "measurements on similar plasmas show that they thermalize in times on the order of the one second that the mixing continues @xcite .",
    "( unlike in section  [ pbargeneration_capture ] , the density of these near - axis antiprotons is relatively high . )",
    "measurements also show that evaporative cooling will set their temperature to several times less than the well depth @xcite .",
    "thus , the near - axis antiproton temperature in the side wells is considerably less than @xmath114 .",
    "the expected number of antiprotons in such a plasma having a perpendicular energy greater than @xmath37 is negligible .",
    "antihydrogen in the alpha experiment is believed formed largely by three body recombination .",
    "this process creates the atoms in highly excited states that can be ionized by sufficiently strong electric fields @xcite .",
    "the strongest electric fields in our trap are found close to the trap wall at the electrode boundaries , and can be as large as @xmath115 .. however , any antiproton born close enough to corners to feel this enhancement will almost surely hit the wall immediately . ]",
    "a newly ionized antiproton will be accelerated by these fields , and can pick up perpendicular energy .",
    "however , a careful map of the electric and magnetic fields over the entire trap shows that the perpendicular energy gain can not exceed more than @xmath116 before the antiproton settles into its @xmath52 motion , so this process can not lead to mirror - trapped antiprotons .",
    "the arguments in the two previous subsections strongly suggest that antihydrogen can not be born with substantial center - of - mass kinetic energy under our experimental conditions .",
    "if an antihydrogen atom were , nonetheless , somehow born with high kinetic energy , this energy would be conveyed to the antiproton upon ionization . naively , this could lead to a mirror - trapped antiproton .",
    "however , there is an upper limit to the amount of energy an antiproton could possess after ionization .",
    "the limit comes from the lorentz force equation ( [ lorentzequation ] ) .",
    "a particle moving at velocity @xmath117 perpendicular to a magnetic field @xmath13 feels a force that is equivalent to that from an electric field of magnitude @xmath118 .",
    "this magnetic force @xmath119 can ionize an antiproton just as can an electric force @xmath120 .",
    "thus , if an antihydrogen atom is sufficiently excited that it can be ionized by the large electric field of strength @xmath121 or less near the trap wall , it will always be ionized by passage through the magnetic field at the center of the trap where it is created if it is moving faster than approximately @xmath122 .",
    "this sets a rough upper limit on the maximum kinetic energy that a high radius , newly ionized antiproton can have of less than @xmath123 .",
    "if an antihydrogen atom has more kinetic energy , it will either : 1 ) be in a relatively low excited state such that it will not be ionized at all , and will hit the trap wall and annihilate promptly . or ( 2 ) be in an ionizable state and be ionized close to the trap axis by the magnetic force , where it will be thermalized and cooled by the abundant population of antiprotons and positrons found there . a more exact calculation , given in [ bstrip ] , lowers this bound substantially for most antiatoms .",
    "the side wells near the trap wall are as deep as @xmath107 .",
    "an antiproton that fell into one of these side wells , either indirectly by ionization or directly by some unknown process during mixing , could pick up substantial parallel energy .",
    "however , the density of antiprotons is very low at large radii , and antiproton - antiproton collisions proportionally infrequent .",
    "multiple collisions would be required to transform the maximum parallel energy of @xmath124 into perpendicular energy of more than @xmath37 .",
    "collisions with neutrals , of course , can only lower the antiproton energy .",
    "thus , we can conclude the parallel energy possessed by an antiproton can not be converted into sufficient perpendicular energy to lead to mirror trapping .",
    "the arguments in the previous sections suggest that there are few , if any , mirror - trapped antiprotons .",
    "this tentative conclusion relies on information gleaned from the simulations of the efficacy of the clearing cycles . ultimately , though , we rule out the existence of mirror - trapped antiprotons by comparing their simulated post magnet shutdown dynamics to our experimental observations .",
    "a direct , independent test of the simulations powerfully buttresses our conclusions .",
    "we performed such a test by deliberately creating a population of mirror - trapped antiprotons .",
    "we began by capturing approximately 70,000 antiprotons from the ad .",
    "these antiprotons were injected over a potential barrier into a deep well , giving them a parallel energy @xmath75 of approximately @xmath125 .",
    "then the antiprotons were held for @xmath126 , during which time collisions partially thermalized the populations , transferring parallel energy into perpendicular energy @xmath24 .",
    "the mean antiproton orbit radius also expanded during this time to approximately @xmath127 .",
    "initial , intermediate , and final @xmath75 distributions are shown in figure  [ mirtrapdist ] .",
    "we have no independent measure of the @xmath24 distribution .",
    "distribution of the deliberately - created mirror - trapped antiprotons , shown just after the antiprotons were dropped over the @xmath128 potential barrier , at @xmath129 post drop , and when thermalization was ended at @xmath126 post drop .",
    "these distributions were obtained by slowly lowering one of the confining electrostatic barriers , and measuring the number of escaping antiprotons as a function of the barrier height . ]    after the thermalization period , the octupole and mirror coils were energized , followed by the removal of the electrostatic well that had been confining the antiprotons .",
    "once this well was removed , the antiprotons remaining in the system must have been mirror trapped . however , many of these antiprotons were not deeply mirror trapped ( @xmath71 ) , and , as can be seen in `` benchmarking '' grouping in table  [ clearsurvivetable ] , many were expelled during the clears .    after the clears , the magnets were turned off , and the annihilation times @xmath130 and positions @xmath131 of the remaining antiprotons were recorded .",
    "the results of 27 of these cycles are shown in figure  [ benchmarkplot]a . during most of these cycles , a bias electric field ( see figure  [ qwp_potentials ] ) was applied during the magnet shutdown whose intent was to aid the discrimination between bare antiprotons and antihydrogen ; the charged antiprotons should be pushed by the bias field so that they preferentially annihilate on the right side ( right bias ) or on the left side ( left bias ) of the trap , while the uncharged antihydrogen atoms should be unaffected by the bias field .",
    "in addition , the bias fields make the pseudopotential wells shallower , so the antiprotons escape and annihilate sooner than when no bias is applied . figure  [ benchmarkplot]b shows the effect of delaying the octupole shutdown onset by about @xmath132 relative to the mirror shutdown onset .",

    "b ) compares the `` no bias '' dataset in a ) with normal shutdown timing , to a no bias dataset in which the octupole decay onset was slowed by about @xmath132 ( purple squares and purple dots ) relative to the mirror decay onset .",
    "the annihilations near @xmath133 , and @xmath134 are at radial steps in the trap wall .",

    "the localization is preserved as the magnets lose strength during the magnet shutdown . ]",
    "also plotted in figure  [ benchmarkplot ] are the results of simulating 3364 post - clear survivors . since we can only characterize the pre - clear and magnet shutdown antiprotons imperfectly ( see figure  [ mirtrapdist ] ) , we must make an estimate for the distribution to use in the simulation .",
    "we believe distribution  2 , defined in section  [ pbarclearing ] , is most appropriate as it has a plausible temperature and no strict upper bound on @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ benchmarkplot ] shows that simulations match the experimental data well .",
    "thus , we can confidently use the antiproton simulations as a tool to aid in the discrimination between mirror - trapped antiprotons and antihydrogen .",
    "these tests also confirm that the bias fields work as expected .",
    "the antihydrogen simulation uses the same magnetic field model as the antiproton simulation , so we have benchmarked the field component of the antihydrogen simulation as well .",
    "as described in section  [ pbargeneration_mixing ] , antihydrogen atoms are created by mixing antiprotons with positrons . initially , the antiprotons have more kinetic energy than the positrons , but we estimate that the antiprotons come into thermal equilibrium with the positrons before the recombination occurs . the positron density is @xmath139 and the positron temperature is @xmath140 @xcite .",
    "we use @xcite to compute a slowing rate of @xmath141 . from @xcite ,",
    "the three body recombination rate is approximately @xmath142 , but this is the steady state rate to reach a binding of @xmath143 . because antihydrogen atoms that have a binding energy of @xmath144 will mostly survive the fields of our trap , the recombination rate will be approximately ten times higher .",
    "this is in approximate agreement with our measurements .",
    "consequently , we expect that the antiprotons cool to the positron temperature before forming antihydrogen .",
    "because the positron mass is negligible compared to the antiproton mass , a newly formed antihydrogen atom inherits its center - of - mass kinetic energy from the antiproton from which it is formed .",
    "thus , we expect that the antihydrogen itself is in thermal equilibrium with the positrons , and possesses the same distribution function  except that the trapped antihydrogen distribution function is truncated at the energy of the neutral trap depth , @xmath15 .",
    "the positron temperature is much greater than this energy .",
    "consequently , we expect that the velocity space distribution function @xmath145 is essentially flat over the relevant energy range for the trapped antihydrogen atoms , and the number of atoms in some velocity range @xmath146 is @xmath147",
    ". the number of atoms trapped should be proportional to @xmath148 . note that because @xmath145 is essentially flat in the relevant region , the antihydrogen distribution @xmath149 , once normalized , does not depend in any significant way on the temperature of the positrons .",
    "however , for concreteness , we did our principal antihydrogen simulations with a temperature of @xmath150 .",
    "the simulations reveal that the energy distribution is not strictly truncated at the trapping depth ( see figure  [ energydist]a ) @xcite .",
    "there exist `` quasi - trapped '' stable trajectories with energies up to about @xmath151 ; similar trajectories exist in neutron traps @xcite .",
    "quasi - trapped trajectories exist because the antiatom motion is three dimensional .",
    "rarely is all of the antiatom s motion parallel to the gradient of @xmath152 at the orbit reflection points at high @xmath152 .",
    "any motion perpendicular to @xmath153 , and the kinetic energy associated with this perpendicular motion , is not available to help penetrate through the reflection point .",
    "hence , the antiatom may be confined even if its energy exceeds the maximum trapping depth .",
    "being only quasi - trapped , these antiatoms are more susceptible to perturbations than antiatoms trapped below the trapping depth .",

    "the reduction in the number of antiatoms that can be trapped from this effect is less than @xmath156 .",

    "however , as is evident from comparing figure  [ benchmarkplot]a and figure  [ trappingannihilations]d , the differences between the annihilation locations for these two distributions are minor ; principally , some of the higher energy antiprotons in distribution  2 annihilate closer to the center of the trap than the antiprotons in distribution  1 .        in general , the agreement between the observed events and the antihydrogen simulations is excellent ; in contrast , the vast majority of observed events are incompatible with the antiproton simulations . as expected , the locations of the observed events are independent of the bias electric fields , as they are in the antihydrogen simulations .",
    "the simulations show , however , that the annihilation locations of postulated antiprotons are strongly dependent on the bias fields .",
    "other simulations , not shown here , show that these conclusions remain true in the face of antiproton energies up to several @xmath159 and gross magnetic field errors .    in  @xcite we limited our analysis to annihilations which occur within @xmath160 of the beginning of the magnet shutdown .",
    "this criterion was based on the observation that , in the simulations , 99% of the antihydrogen atoms annihilated by @xmath160 . here ,",

    "these events also appear to be incompatible with the antiproton simulations .",
    "while we have no definitive explanation of these events , there are several possibilities : 1 ) even if all 309 events were genuinely due to antihydrogen , we would expect 1% of the events to be improperly excluded because of the @xmath130 criterion ; the total number of events thereby improperly excluded would be expected to be three .",

    "this allows the antiprotons to find the `` hole '' in the trap center , and causes the antiproton annihilations to be concentrated there in the no bias case ( see figure  [ benchmarkplot ] ) . when a bias is applied , the center of the pseudopotential moves to the side ( figure  [ qwp_potentials ] ) , and the annihilation center follows .",

    "such a positron will be bound only by a negligible binding energy , and the antiatom will almost instantly be destroyed by either collisions with another positron ( inside the positron plasma ) or by a weak axial electric field ( just outside the plasma ) .",
