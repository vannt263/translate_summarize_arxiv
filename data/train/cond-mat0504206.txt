    "the creation , detection , and study of exciton condensates in semiconductors constitute interesting problems in condensed matter physics.@xcite exciton populations are usually created by photo - exciting a semiconductor , so that the electron - hole pairs consist of conduction band electrons and valence band holes .",
    "then , optical techniques are employed to detect and study the excitonic system.@xcite recently , there has also been interest in the possibility of _ electrical detection _ , and the realization _ without photoexcitation _ , of such exotic states in a bilayer quantum hall system , where the excitons result from the pairing of electrons in one quantum hall layer with holes in the neighboring layer.@xcite this report examines a hybrid scenario where _ photoexcitation _ serves to create inter - landau level , instead of inter - band , excitations in a quantum hall system , as _ electrical detection _ is employed to detect the system response.@xcite in particular , we study _ transport _ in a semiconductor single - layer two - dimensional electron system , where _ microwave photo - excitation _ produces a steady state density of inter - landau level excitations ( `` excitons '' ) .",
    "surprisingly , such a system exhibits novel zero - resistance states without concomitant hall quantization , at low temperatures , @xmath3 , about magnetic fields , @xmath4 = @xmath5 and @xmath4 = @xmath6 , where @xmath7 = @xmath8 , @xmath9 is an effective mass , @xmath10 is the electron charge , and @xmath11 is the radiation frequency.@xcite the experimental observations have led to a broad theoretical study of this situation.@xcite    at the present , it is uncertain whether the observed zero - resistance states should be viewed as a novel condensate with a role for excitons , although we had suggested this possibility.@xcite theoretical studies have realized radiation - induced magneto - resistivity oscillations through various approaches.@xcite the observed zero - resistance states have then been attributed to a negative resistivity instability , and current - domain formation.@xcite as there remain many open questions from both the experimental and theoretical perspectives , we examine here just the experimental situation , and refer the reader to the literature for further theory .",
    "experiments were carried out on standard devices fabricated from gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "the best material was typically characterized by an electron density , @xmath12(4.2 k ) @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 , and an electron mobility , @xmath18 , up to @xmath19 @xmath15 @xmath20 @xmath21/vs .",
    "standard four - terminal lock - in based electrical measurements were performed with the sample mounted inside a waveguide and immersed in pumped liquid he-3 or he-4 .",
    "electromagnetic ( em ) waves in the microwave part of the spectrum were generated using tunable sources .",
    "the em waves were directed to the sample through the waveguide .",
    "further details appear elsewhere.@xcite    the data of fig .",
    "1(a ) illustrate the radiation - induced effect on the diagonal ( @xmath22 ) and hall resistances ( @xmath23 ) , when the specimen is excited with microwaves at @xmath11 = 108 ghz . in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the application of microwaves induces giant oscillations in @xmath22 , which are characterized by the property that the @xmath22 under photoexcitation drops below the dark @xmath22 over wide @xmath4 intervals .",
    "thus , at approximately @xmath24 = @xmath25 and @xmath24 = @xmath26 , with @xmath25 = 1,2,3 ... , the @xmath22 under photoexcitation is equal to the dark @xmath22 . for @xmath27 , the photo - excited @xmath22",
    "is reduced with respect to the dark @xmath22 . on the other hand , for @xmath28 , the irradiated @xmath22",
    "is enhanced with respect to the dark @xmath22 .",
    "a remarkable feature in the data are the zero - resistance states which are manifested about @xmath29 , i.e. , in the vicinity of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these @xmath22 minima exhibit activated transport vs. the temperature , which is suggestive , from the experimental perspective , of a possible radiation - induced gap in the electronic spectrum.@xcite    the data of fig .",
    "1a also illustrate the influence of radiation on the hall effect . here",
    ", a comparison of the dark @xmath23 with the photo - excited @xmath23 reveals subtle microwave induced oscillations , which are period commensurate with the radiation induced @xmath22 oscillations.@xcite yet , there do not occur microwave - induced plateaus in the hall effect that coincide with the radiation - induced vanishing @xmath22 in the vicinity of b = @xmath5 and @xmath32 . in order to highlight these radiation - induced changes in @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath33 is shown along with @xmath22 in fig .",
    "1(b ) . a comparison of fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "1(b ) shows clearly that @xmath23 is reduced in magnitude over the b - intervals , where @xmath22 is enhanced by the radiation . on the other hand , as the diagonal resistance vanishes upon microwave excitation , as in the vicinity of @xmath30 , for example , the correction @xmath34 also vanishes .    as the period of the radiation induced oscillations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) are mostly sensitive to the @xmath4-component that is perpendicular to the plane of the 2des , they tend to span a wider @xmath4-interval , at a finite tilt angle of the specimen .",
    "thus , under tilt , the characteristic field scale becomes @xmath35 , and the dark @xmath22 intercepts the photo - excited @xmath22 in the vicinity of @xmath36/j$ ] and @xmath36/(j+1/2)$ ] , with @xmath25 = 1,2,3 ... these features can be detected in fig . 2    the phase of the radiation induced @xmath22 oscillations is an important parameter because it can be used to compare experiment to theory.@xcite to determine this observable , @xmath22 maxima and minima of 182 ghz data ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are initially labelled by integers and half - integers , respectively , assuming a cosine waveform .",
    "the extrema labels , denoted by the index @xmath37 in fig . 3 ,",
    "are then plotted vs. extremal values of @xmath38 , and a linear fit , @xmath39 , is applied to determine the slope , @xmath40 = @xmath7 , and the ordinate intercept . in fig .",
    "3 , the ordinate intercept for the fit of extremal data points at 1/4 demonstrates a 1/4-cycle phase shift of the extrema with respect to the assumed ( cosine ) waveform.@xcite thus , the plot ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) demonstrates that the phase is broadly consistent with a lineshape @xmath41 , i.e. , resistance minima about @xmath42 , and resistance maxima about @xmath43 .",
    "a similar analysis of the nodes or fixed points suggests that they are characterized by @xmath44 , or @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "3 .    in prior work",
    ", we have shown that the radiation induced resistance _ minima _ exhibit activated transport , i.e. , @xmath46.@xcite as a supplement to that previous report , we examine the @xmath3-dependence of the resistance _ maxima _ in fig .",
    "thus , the inset in fig .",
    "4 shows @xmath22 under microwave excitation , with a pair of marked maxima , whose @xmath3-evolution is followed in the main part of the figure .",
    "4 shows that the @xmath22 maxima increase rapidly with decreasing temperature , and the variation can be empirically represented by an exponential function .",
    "the @xmath3-variation of the maxima have been attributed by dmitriev et al .",
    ", to the @xmath3-dependence of the inelastic scattering rate.@xcite    measurements examining possible reflection / emission and transmission characteristics of the high mobility 2des under microwave excitation are illustrated in fig .",
    "5 and fig .",
    "6 . for these experiments",
    "[ see inset , figs . 5 and 6 ] , a resistance sensor was placed immediately above or below the sample.@xcite    fig .",
    "5 exhibits the dark , and irradiated at 30 ghz , @xmath22 , along with the sensor @xmath47 response under photoexcitation . the irradiated @xmath22 shows giant microwave - induced oscillations .",
    "note that , in this low-@xmath11 case , the irradiated @xmath22 crosses the dark @xmath22 also near @xmath48 . also shown in the figure",
    "is @xmath49 , which serves to bring out weak features in the @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath47 signal shows a pair of significant features between @xmath7 and 2@xmath7 . here , the largest feature might originate from a two - photon process . in the derivative signal ,",
    "there is a very weak feature near -@xmath7 ( but not at + @xmath7 ) , which could signify electrically detected cyclotron resonance .",
    "the origin of other structure in the sensor signal is not fully understood .",
    "some transmission measurements are shown in fig .",
    ", the optimal radiation induced @xmath22 response was observed in the vicinity of -9 db . a further increase of the radiation intensity ( db @xmath50 0 ) produced a reduction in the peak height along with an increase in the resistance at the minima ( see fig .",
    "6(a ) ) . at the same time , the transmission sensor ( see fig .",
    "6(b ) ) indicated structure at @xmath4 @xmath51 @xmath7 , which correlated with a strong radiation - induced decrease in @xmath22 just above 0.3 tesla .",
    "observed oscillations in @xmath22 below @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) were imperceptible , however , in the detector response ( see fig .",
    "6(b ) ) .",
    "it is also interesting to examine the effect of simultaneous excitation of the specimen at two different microwave frequencies.@xcite thus , fig .",
    "7 exhibits measurements with excitation of the specimen at 15 ghz only , and at 50 ghz only . here , at 50 ghz",
    ", there occur a number of radiation - induced oscillations and one broad zero - resistance state about @xmath52 . on the other hand , at 15 ghz , the radiation seems to produce a non - monotonic variation in @xmath22 , mostly above @xmath7 .",
    "simultaneous excitation at two - frequencies produces a @xmath22 trace that looks very much like the trace at the higher @xmath11 , i.e. , 50 ghz . an interesting feature is observed here by comparing the @xmath53 and @xmath54 signals at @xmath4 @xmath13 0.07 t and @xmath4 @xmath13 0.14 t. at both these @xmath4 , the peak amplitude of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 signal is reduced with respect to the @xmath54 signal . yet",
    ", one observes that in the @xmath4 @xmath13 0.07 t case , only @xmath53 produces an enhancement , while in the @xmath4 @xmath13 0.14 t case , it produces a resistance suppression , with respect to the dark signal .",
    "thus , perhaps , one should attribute the small decrease in the amplitude of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 signal to a `` breakdown '' type heating effect , due to the increased radiation intensity resulting from the combined excitation .",
    "in summary , radiation induced zero - resistance states and associated oscillations in the high mobility 2des exhibit a rich phenomenology . here , we have shown that ( a ) @xmath22 exhibits saturation at zero - resistance under microwave excitation in the vicinity of @xmath55 b_{f}$ ] , with concomitant vanishing hall resistance correction , @xmath56 , see fig . 1 , ( b ) the period of the radiation induced oscillations are mostly sensitive of the normal component of the magnetic field , see fig .",
    "2 , ( c ) the oscillatory minima are shifted by 1/4 cycle with respect to the @xmath57 = @xmath25 condition , see fig . 3 , ( d ) the oscillatory resistance maxima increase strongly with decreasing temperature , see fig . 4 , ( e ) a response is observable in the transmission and reflection signals , mostly above @xmath7 , see figs . 5 and 6 , and ( e ) simultaneous photoexcitation at two radiation frequencies seems not to produce simple superposition , see fig . 7 .",
