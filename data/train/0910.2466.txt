    "all magnetars have characteristic ages @xmath1 , and their persistent soft x - ray luminosities @xmath2 ( although some are transients , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are likely of thermal origin , are systematically higher by factors of @xmath3 than the power available from rotation @xcite , cooling , or accretion @xcite .",
    "taken together , these observations suggest that magnetars magnetic fields decay and thereby induce heating in the stellar interiors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "sustaining the persistent thermal emission requires an interior energy reservoir @xmath4 comparing this to the magnetar s total internal magnetic energy @xmath5 gives @xmath6 .",
    "however , these values are likely flagrant underestimations : first , a magnetar emits most of its thermal energy as neutrinos .",
    "indeed , @xcite argue that , to avoid severe neutrino losses , the heat source powering the thermal emission must be located at or near the outer crust , i.e. , within the magnetar s outermost @xmath7 . if the thermal emission originates from magnetic energy contained only within the outer crust , then @xmath8 .",
    "second , a magnetar s magnetic field powers other phenomena as well , such as giant flares ; the 2004 december 27 giant flare from sgr 180620 released @xmath9 , which implies @xmath8 ( assuming giant flares are recurrent ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "that the magnetic field s strength is much greater in the crust than at the surface implies that a substantial @xmath10 gradient exists .",
    "therefore , if the crustal field geometry is primarily nonradial , magnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity .",
    "we argue in  [ s.fielddecayecaptures ] that the crust loses magnetic pressure support as @xmath10 decays and compensates with an increase in electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "the accompanying increase in the electron fermi energy induces exothermic electron captures that heat the crust .",
    "we calculate the total energy released via field - decay electron captures in  [ s.crustalheating ] and compare it to joule heating in  [ s.jouleheatingcomparison ] .",
    "we discuss our results and speculate on other consequences of field - decay electron captures in  [ s.discussion ] .",
    "we construct a simple model of the hydrostatic structure of a neutron star s strongly magnetized outer crust to illustrate the process by which magnetic field decay induces electron captures .",
    "we ignore the inner crust both for simplicity and because most of the thermal energy released there escapes as neutrinos .",
    "consider a neutron star of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 .",
    "the outer crust s scale height ( @xmath7 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much less than @xmath12 ; therefore , we adopt a plane - parallel geometry and set the gravitational acceleration @xmath13 to be constant throughout the layer .",
    "furthermore , we make three assumptions regarding the crustal magnetic field : ( 1 ) its nonradial ( e.g. , toroidal ) component is large relative to its radial component , ( 2 ) the field strength in the crust is greater than that at the stellar surface , and ( 3 ) the field decays with time .",
    "these assumptions are likely satisfied in magnetars @xcite .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in the electron magnetohydrodynamic limit is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the density , @xmath16 is the pressure , and @xmath17 is the magnetic field .",
    "we ignore the magnetic field s affect on @xmath16 ( see appendix ) .",
    "setting the radial component of @xmath17 equal to zero by assumption ( 1 ) for simplicity , the equation of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium becomes @xmath18 invoking the plane - parallel geometry and rewriting equation ( [ e.verthydroeq ] ) in terms of the lagrangian coordinate @xmath19 , the column depth as measured from the surface ( such that @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 finally , integrating equation ( [ e.verthydroeq2 ] ) from the surface , we get @xmath22,\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath23 at the surface , where @xmath24 , and included the explicit time and spatial dependences of @xmath16 and @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ e.verthydroeq3 ] ) shows that electron degeneracy pressure and the magnetic field together support the column of matter @xmath19 against gravity .",
    "consider a matter element at column depth @xmath19 containing a nucleus of mass @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass number and @xmath27 is the proton number , as @xmath10 decays with time .",
    "the column gradually loses magnetic pressure support ; to compensate , @xmath16 , and thereby the electron fermi energy @xmath28 , increases with time . when @xmath29 , electron capture onto the nucleus becomes energetically favorable .",
    "the nuclear species at a given @xmath19 is a function of @xmath28 ( or equivalently , @xmath16 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so even when the crust is initially at equilibrium , electron captures will occur : any nucleus that is stable at a given @xmath28 is unstable to capture at a sufficiently larger @xmath28 .",
    "the loss of magnetic pressure support due to field decay forces nuclei out of their initial equilibrium and into a new equilibrium configuration .",
    "electron captures can be exothermic in two mutually inclusive ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : ( 1 ) an electron captures into an exited state of the daughter nucleus if , for example , the daughter nucleus s ground state is forbidden .",
    "the daughter nucleus then radiatively deexcites and thereby heats the crust .",
    "( 2 ) if the parent nucleus is even - even , then @xmath30 due to the nuclear pairing energy , and a second , nonequilibrium electron capture immediately ensues and releases heat .",
    "this process resembles the well - known deep crustal heating in accreting neutron stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : in that context , @xmath16 alone supports the matter column against gravity , so @xmath31 .",
    "the accretion - driven advection of a matter element to higher pressures , and thereby higher @xmath28 , induces electron captures that heat the crust . in magnetars , however , it is not accretion , but magnetic field decay , that induces electron captures of a matter element and thus induces electron captures as well , although it is unimportant for sgrs and axps because they rotate slowly .",
    "this effect is similar to rotochemical heating in neutron star cores @xcite . ] .",
    "we now estimate the total thermal energy released in the outer crust via field - decay electron captures . consider a neutron star crust with an initial magnetic field @xmath32 and that contains an ion species with an electron capture threshold energy @xmath33 , such that electrons capture when @xmath34 . after a period of time ,",
    "the crustal magnetic field decays ( via unspecified means ) to @xmath35 . for relativistic , degenerate electrons , @xmath36 ; we define @xmath37 to be the pressure at which @xmath38 .",
    "we now determine the column of matter within which electrons capture as the field decays from @xmath32 to @xmath39 .",
    "the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium equations for columns of matter at the electron capture pressure @xmath37 before and after field decay are ( equation ( [ e.verthydroeq3 ] ) ) @xmath40,\\label{e.hydroeqinit}\\\\ g { \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ec , f}}}&= &   { p_{\\mathrm{ec}}}+ \\frac{1}{8\\pi } [ { b_{\\mathrm{f}}}^{2 } ( { \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ec , f } } } )   - { b_{\\mathrm{f}}}^{2 } ( 0)]\\label{e.hydroeqfin},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electron capture column depths . subtracting equation ( [ e.hydroeqfin ] ) from ( [ e.hydroeqinit ] ) and noting that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 by assumptions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) gives the total column of matter available as nuclear fuel , @xmath46 see figure [ f.schematic ] for a schematic diagram .    assuming spherical symmetry , the total energy released via electron captures @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the energy per nucleon released via electron capture and @xmath49 is the mean nucleon mass .",
    "in general , a nucleus will undergo several electron captures in the outer crust as the field decays , but for most reactions @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "captures that release the most heat occur near neutron drip ( where @xmath51 ) , i.e. , those that induce neutron emissions ; @xcite find @xmath52 . from equations ( [ e.deltasigma ] ) and ( [ e.energyrelease1 ] ) , and normalizing to conditions at neutron drip , @xmath53",
    "the usual explanation for magnetars persistent thermal emission is joule heating in the crust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the crust s electrical resistivity is nonzero , so currents generating the internal magnetic field decay in time , converting some of the magnetic energy to thermal energy and thereby heating the crust . in this section , we compare heating via field - decay electron captures to joule heating .    from equation ( [ e.deltasigma ] ) and",
    "the expression for the capture pressure scale height for relativistic , degenerate electrons @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the mean molecular weight per electron , equation ( [ e.energyrelease1 ] ) becomes @xmath56 the term @xmath57 , the total magnetic energy contained in a crust of scale height @xmath58 ; the ratio of the total nuclear energy released via field - decay electron captures to the total magnetic energy @xmath59 nuclear heating and joule heating are comparable if all of the magnetic energy converts to thermal energy .",
    "however , unlike electron captures , the crustal magnetic field powers phenomena other than the thermal emission , such as the hard ( @xmath60 ) nonthermal x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , x - ray bursts , and giant flares .",
    "the fraction of magnetic energy that contributes to the thermal emission is unknown .",
    "therefore , we conclude that heating via field - decay electron captures is a considerable , if not the primary , source of the persistent soft x - ray luminosity from magnetars",
    ".    however , we stress that equations ( [ e.energyrelease2]-[e.energyratio ] ) are upper limits with respect to our assumed magnetic field configuration .",
    "if the field were instead predominantly radial or force - free , for example , field decay would induce little nuclear heating .",
    "in this work , we identified a new , strong heat source in magnetar crusts .",
    "magnetic pressure partially supports the crust against gravity .",
    "the electron degeneracy pressure increases as the crust loses magnetic pressure support during field decay , and the concomitant increase in @xmath28 induces exothermic electron captures .",
    "the total heat released via field - decay electron captures is of order the crust s total magnetic energy .",
    "field - decay electron captures are important to neutron stars magneto - thermal evolution and should be included in future calculations . at a minimum",
    ", field - decay electron captures supplement joule heating and lessen the interior magnetic field strength required to power magnetar phenomena ; however , since only a fraction of the crust s magnetic energy , but essentially all of the nuclear energy , converts to thermal energy , field - decay electron captures may in fact dominate magnetars persistent soft x - ray emission .",
    "we now outline other potential ramifications of this work :    \\(1 ) although we neglected both the inner crust and outermost envelope for simplicity , field - decay - induced nuclear reactions can occur there as well .",
    "in addition to electron captures in the inner crust , the loss of magnetic pressure support may trigger light - element fusion reactions in the envelope or pycnonuclear reactions in the inner crust , since @xmath15 increases at a fixed @xmath19 during field decay .",
    "\\(2 ) the crust s electrical resistivity decreases with @xmath15 and increases with @xmath61 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so magnetic field decay via hall - drift - enhanced ohmic dissipation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is most efficient at low densities and high temperatures .",
    "magnetic pressure support lowers @xmath15 at a given @xmath19 relative to the nonmagnetic case , and field - decay electron captures heat the crust ; both effects accelerate ohmic dissipation .",
    "\\(3 ) although it is the dominant mechanism , field decay is not required to induce electron captures .",
    "for example , rearrangement of the crustal magnetic field via hall drift , which is nondissipative , can induce captures : altering magnetic pressure gradients alone can either raise or lower the electron pressure , and thereby @xmath28 , of a matter parcel past an electron capture threshold . raising @xmath28 past a capture threshold triggers exothermic",
    "electron captures , but lowering @xmath28 past a threshold does nothing , since exothermic captures are effectively irreversible .",
    "this may further enhance the heating rate , and hence the ohmic dissipation rate , in the crust .",
    "\\(4 ) asymmetries in the internal magnetic field relative to the stellar rotation axis produce distortions in a young , rapidly rotating magnetar that may generate gravitational waves .",
    "a nascent misalignment between the rotation and magnetic axes is secularly unstable and grows with time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the distorting magnetic field is predominantly nonradial and within the crust , the resulting field evolution causes electron captures , which can generate asymmetric density variations that intensify gravitational wave emission ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* who proposed a similar mechanism for weakly magnetic , accreting neutron stars ) .",
    "\\(5 ) we neglected the crust s elasticity in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( [ e.hydroeq ] ) .",
    "elasticity partially compensates local magnetic stresses and thereby delays electron captures ; conversely , sudden pressure increases that offset fracture - induced elasticity losses during catastrophic events like sgr bursts and giant flares may trigger electron captures . while unlikely to contribute to the burst s emission itself , captures triggered by crust fracture may contribute to the subsequent transient cooling ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
