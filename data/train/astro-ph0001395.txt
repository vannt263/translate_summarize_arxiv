    "starbursts , episodes of intense star formation lasting @xmath6 years , are now one of the cornerstones of the modern view of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "starbursts touch on almost all aspects of extra - galactic astronomy , from the processes of primeval galaxy formation at high redshift to being a significant mode of star formation even in the present epoch , and covering systems of all sizes from dwarf galaxies to the dust - enshrouded starbursts in ultraluminous merging galaxies ( see heckman 1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "an inescapable consequence of a starburst is the driving of a powerful galactic wind ( total energy @xmath7 , velocity @xmath8 ) from the host galaxy into the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) due to the return of energy and metal - enriched gas into the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) from the large numbers of massive stars formed during the burst ( chevalier & clegg 1985 , hereafter cc ; mccarthy , heckman & van breugel 1987 ) .",
    "the best developed theoretical model for starburst - driven galactic winds , elaborated over the years by various workers ( see the review by heckman , lehnert & armus 1993 . see also tomisaka & bregman 1993 ; suchkov 1994 ) , is of outflows of supernova - ejecta and swept - up ism driven by the the mechanical energy of multiple type ii supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars .",
    "this paradigm is very successful at explaining almost all of the observed properties of galactic winds , and can reproduce quantitatively what is known of the kinematics and energetics of observed local starburst - driven outflows .",
    "galactic winds are unambiguously detected in many local edge - on starburst galaxies ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) , and their presence can even be inferred in starbursts at high redshift ( pettini 1999 ) .",
    "filamentary optical emission line gas , soft thermal x - ray emission and non - thermal radio emission , all extended preferentially along the minor axis of the galaxy and emanating in a loosely collimated flow from a nuclear starburst , are all classic signatures of a galactic wind . in the closest and brightest",
    "edge - on starburst galaxies the outflow can be seen in all phases of the ism , from cold molecular gas to hot x - ray emitting plasma ( dahlem 1997 ) .",
    "galactic winds are of cosmological importance in several ways :    1 .",
    "the transport of metal - enriched gas out of galaxies by such winds affects the chemical evolution of galaxies and the igm .",
    "this effect may be extremely important in understanding the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies where metal ejection efficiencies are expected to be higher ( dekel & silk 1986 ; bradamante , matteucci & dercole 1998 ) .",
    "2 .   galactic winds may also be responsible for reheating the igm , evidence of which is seen in the entropy profiles of gas in the inter - cluster medium ( icm ) of groups and clusters ( ponman , cannon & navarro 1999 )",
    ". a substantial fraction of the metals now in the icm were probably transported out of the source galaxies by early galactic winds ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "3 .   galactic winds are an extreme mode of the `` feedback '' between star formation and the ism .",
    "this feedback is a necessary , indeed vital , ingredient of the recipes for galaxy formation employed in todays cosmological n - body and semi - analytical models of galaxy formation .",
    "an aspect of feedback where galactic winds will have an important effect , and where the existing prescriptions for feedback need updating with less ad hoc models , is in the escape of hot gas from haloes of galaxies , in particular low mass galaxies .",
    "this directly affects the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function in semi - analytical galaxy formation models ( kauffman , guiderdoni & white 1994 ; cole 1994 ; somerville & primack 1999 ) , as recently discussed by martin ( 1999 ) .",
    "assessing the importance of starburst - driven winds quantitatively requires going beyond what is currently known of their properties .",
    "it is necessary to make more quantitative measurements of parameters such as mass loss rates , energy content and chemical abundances , and how these relate to the properties of the underlying starburst and host galaxy .",
    "this in turn requires a deeper understanding the basic physics of such outflows , and the mechanisms underlying the multi - wavelength emission we see .",
    "in particular , the origin of the soft x - ray emission seen in galactic winds is currently uncertain , with several different models currently being advanced ( as we shall discuss below ) .",
    "this uncertainty in what we are actually observing makes estimating the total mass and energy content of these winds difficult .",
    "recent theoretical and hydrodynamical models ( de young & heckman 1994 ; mac low & ferrara 1999 ; dercole & brighenti 1999 ) suggest that starburst - driven winds are in general not efficient at ejecting significant amounts of the host galaxy s ism , in the single burst scenarios that have been explored until now .",
    "more complex star formation histories have yet to be explored numerically , but qualitative arguments suggest mass loss rates will be even lower than in single burst scenarios ( strickland & stevens 1999 ) .",
    "this is beginning to overturn the popular concept of catastrophic mass loss in dwarf galaxies due to galactic winds advanced by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) and vader ( 1986 ) .    despite the sophistication of these and other recent models",
    ", it has not been shown that these simulations reproduce the observed kinematics , energetics and emission properties of any real starburst - driven outflow .",
    "a very wide range of model parameters can produce a bipolar outflow , and only a relatively small number of models have been run which explore only a limited parameter space .",
    "more rigorous tests and comparisons of the _ observable _ properties of the different theoretical models against the available observational data are now required to judge the relative successes and failures of the current theory .",
    "observational attempts to directly measure the mass and energy content of galactic winds , using optical or x - ray observations ( martin 1999 ; read , ponman & strickland 1997 ; strickland , ponman & stevens 1997 ) have been made .",
    "unfortunately these may only be accurate to an order of magnitude , given that the volume filling factors of the cool @xmath9 and hot @xmath10 gas phases that are probed by these observations are unknown .",
    "this uncertainty in filling factor affects all observational studies of the hot gas in starburst galaxies , such as wang ( 1995 ) , dahlem ( 1996 ) , della ceca , griffiths & heckman ( 1997 ) to name only a few .",
    "the soft x - ray emission from galactic winds and starburst galaxies is well fit by thermal plasma models of one or more components with temperatures in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12 ( read 1997 ; ptak 1997 ; dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 among many others ) .",
    "a variety of models have been put forward to explain the soft x - ray emission from galactic winds .",
    "currently the origin and physical state of the emitting gas is not clear , either observationally or theoretically .",
    "there is little disagreement that the diffuse soft x - ray emission comes from some form of hot gas .",
    "the main uncertainties lie in the filling factor and thermal distribution of this gas .",
    "these in turn affect the degree to which soft x - ray observations provide a good probe of the important properties of galactic winds that we need to measure  the mass and energy content and the chemical composition .",
    "different models for the origin of the soft x - ray emission from galactic winds range from shock - heated clouds ( of low volume filling factor ) embedded in a more tenuous wind ( cc ) , through conductive interfaces between hot and cold gas ( dercole & brighenti 1999 ) , to emission from a volume - filling hot gas where the wind density has been increased by the hydrodynamical disruption of clouds overrun by the wind ( suchkov 1996 ) .    in m82",
    "the x - ray emission occupies a similar area in projection to both the emission line filaments ( watson , stanger & griffiths 1984 , shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) and to the radio emission ( seaquist & odegard 1991 ) .",
    "although existing x - ray observations of m82 and other galactic winds do not have the spatial resolution necessary to constrain the exact relationship between the emission line gas and the hot gas , the general similarity in the two spatial distributions have prompted models where the soft x - ray emission comes from shock - heated clouds ( watson 1984 ; cc ) . in this hypothesis both the optical line emission and",
    "the soft x - ray emission come from clouds shocked by a fast tenuous , and presumably hotter , wind that the clouds are embedded in .",
    "the wind drives fast shocks into less tenuous clouds causing soft thermal x - ray emission , and slower shocks into denser clouds causing optical emission .",
    "the clouds occupy very little of the total volume , but dominate the total emission .",
    "the distribution of clouds within the wind hence determines both the observed distribution of optical and x - ray emission .",
    "the temperature of the x - ray - emitting gas is determined by the speed of the shock waves driven into them , which is then determined by the density of the clouds and the density and velocity of the wind running into them .",
    "two dimensional hydrodynamical models of galactic winds ( tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; tomisaka & bregman ( 1993 ) ; suchkov 1994 , here after ti , tb and s94 respectively ) strongly favor interpretations of the x - ray emission coming from shock - heated ism overrun by the wind .",
    "in this model we do not see the `` wind '' itself , as it is too tenuous to emit efficiently enough to be detected . if this model is correct , then x - ray observations do not directly probe the heavy element - enriched wind fluid that drives the outflow and contains most of the total energy .",
    "dercole & brighenti ( 1999 ) suggest that s94 s conclusion , that the majority of soft x - ray emission in their hydrodynamical simulations arise from shocked disk and halo gas , was incorrect .",
    "they point out that the numerically unresolved interfaces between cold and hot gas have the correct temperature and density to produce large amounts of soft x - ray emission .",
    "such regions are almost inevitable in hydrodynamical simulations , and would be very difficult to distinguish from regions of cold disk gas shock - heated by the surrounding hot wind material .",
    "in reality thermal conduction can lead to physically broadened interface regions , which could be a significant source of soft thermal x - ray emission in galactic winds .",
    "such conductive interfaces are believed to dominate the x - ray emission in wind - blown bubbles ( weaver 1977 ) , which are very similar to the superbubbles young starbursts blow .",
    "fabbiano ( 1988 ) and bregman , schulman & tomisaka ( 1995 ) explicitly interpret the x - ray emission from m82 in terms of it being from an adiabatically expanding hot wind , in contrast to shock - heated clouds model above .",
    "the temperature and density of the gas in such a model of a volume - filling x - ray emitting wind is determined by the energy and mass injection rates within the starburst , and also by the outflow geometry which controls the degree of adiabatic expansion and cooling the wind experiences .",
    "if this model is correct then soft x - ray observations provide a good probe of the hot gas driving the outflow , and hence of the metal abundance , mass and energy content of starburst - driven winds .",
    "cc had explicitly rejected the wind itself being the source of the x - ray emission seen in m82 by watson ( 1984 ) .",
    "the problem is that , for reasonable estimates of the wind s mass and energy injection rate based on m82 s supernova ( sn ) rate , the outflow has a very low density .",
    "as the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the density , the resulting x - ray luminosity is extremely low .",
    "for example , for a sn rate of @xmath13 with a resultant wind mass injection rate of @xmath14 , and a starburst region of radius @xmath15 , the resulting total @xmath16  @xmath17 x - ray luminosity from within a radius @xmath18 is only @xmath19 , about 60 per cent of which comes from within the starburst region itself .",
    "this is a factor @xmath20 times the starburst s wind energy injection rate , and considerably less than the observed @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 luminosity of m82 s wind of @xmath21 ( strickland 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible to rescue the concept of a volume filling wind fluid being responsible for the observed x - ray luminosity if the wind has been strongly mass loaded ( additional mass has been efficiently mixed into the wind )  a theoretical model presented by suchkov ( 1996 , here after s96 ) and subsequently explored further by hartquist , dyson & williams ( 1997 ) .",
    "increasing the mass injection rate into the wind by a factor @xmath22 increases the wind density by @xmath23 and emissivity by a factor @xmath24 , as not only is there more mass in the wind but its outflow velocity is lower .",
    "bregman ( 1985 ) used _ rosat _ hri observations of m82 to argue that the observed x - ray surface brightness distribution was consistent with a well - collimated adiabatically expanding hot gas .",
    "however , analysis of the spectral properties of a set of regions along m82 s wind using _ rosat _ pspc data by strickland ( 1997 ) shows that the entropy of the soft x - ray emitting gas increases with distance from the plane of the galaxy , which is inconsistent with an adiabatic outflow model .    a conservative assessment",
    "would be that x - ray observations do not strongly constrain the origin of the soft x - ray emission in galactic winds beyond that it is from a hot thermal plasma .",
    "the existing observations are broadly consistent with any of the models advanced above : shocked clouds , thermal conduction or mass - loading .    even assessing theoretically the relative importance of processes such as mass - loading",
    "as compared to shock - heating or thermal conduction has not been possible up until now .",
    "s96 argued that m82 s wind must be mass - loaded to produce the required soft x - ray luminosity and temperatures .",
    "however , their mass loaded wind simulations did not include the interaction of the wind with the ambient ism , which s94 had showed was capable of providing the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "uncertainties in the filling factor are not the only problems affecting the interpretation of soft x - ray data on galactic winds .",
    "understanding the temperature distribution of the x - ray emitting gas is also an important , if relatively unexplored , theoretical aspect of galactic winds . deriving plasma properties from x - ray spectra requires fitting a spectral model that is a good approximation to the true emission process .",
    "failure to do so can lead to models that fit the data well but give meaningless results .",
    "a good example of this is x - ray derived metal abundances , where many _ rosat _ and _ asca _ studies of starburst galaxies report extremely low metal abundances , between @xmath25 to @xmath26 times solar ( ptak 1997 , ptak 1997 , tsuru 1997 , read 1997 ) for the soft thermal plasma components .",
    "we believe this to be primarily an artefact of using overly simplistic spectral models to fit the limited - quality data available from these missions .",
    "consistent with the idea that the x - ray emission comes from a complex range of temperatures , dahlem ( 1998 ) have shown that , when using multiple hot plasma components to represent the soft thermal emission from galactic winds , most of the galaxies in their sample could be fit using solar element abundances .",
    "strickland & stevens ( 1998 ) , using simulated _ rosat _ pspc observations of wind - blown bubbles ( physically very similar to superbubbles and the early stages of galactic winds ) , show that under - modeling the x - ray spectra leads to severely underestimating the metal abundance .",
    "failure to correctly fit one parameter such as the metal abundance can also severely bias other plasma properties .",
    "for example , the derived emission measure ( proportional to the density squared integrated over the volume ) is approximately inversely proportional to the fitted metal abundance for gas in the temperature range @xmath27 to @xmath28 . underestimating the metal abundance then leads to overestimates of the gas density , and hence gas mass and energy content .    in an effort to address many of the issues described above ,",
    "we have performed the most detailed hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds to date .",
    "we investigate a larger volume of model parameter space than any previous numerical study , inspired by the latest observational studies of the archetypal starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "we study the variation in the properties of these galactic winds due to the starburst star formation history and intensity , the host galaxy ism distribution and the presence and distribution of mass - loading of the wind by dense clouds .",
    "our aim in this series of papers is to go beyond the previous hydrodynamical simulations of galactic winds , and to :    1 .",
    "explore in a more systematic manner the available model parameter space , focusing on m82 ( the best - studied starburst with a galactic wind ) , using 2-d hydrodynamical simulations run at high numerical resolution .",
    "investigate several important aspects of galactic winds that are currently uncertain or have previously not been devoted much attention : * the origin and filling factor of the soft x - ray emitting gas , along with the temperature distribution of this gas . * the wind energy budget and energy transport efficiency , and the degree to which the energy content can be probed by soft x - ray observations . *",
    "wind collimation . producing the observed properties of well collimated winds with narrow bases seems to be a problem for the simulations of ti , tb and s94 , as has been pointed out by tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun ( 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "3 .   assess the effect of finite numerical resolution and other numerical artefacts on the results of these simulations .",
    "4 .   directly compare the observable properties of these models ( primarily concentrating on their soft x - ray emission ) to the available observational data for m82 and other local starburst galaxies .",
    "in paper ii we discuss the _ observable _ x - ray properties of the winds in these simulations . focusing on artificial _ rosat _",
    "pspc x - ray images and spectra ( the pspc has been the best x - ray instrument for the study of superbubbles and galactic winds due to it s superior sensitivity to diffuse soft thermal emission over other instruments such as the _ rosat _ hri or the imaging spectrometers upon _ asca _ ) we consider ( a ) the success of these models at reproducing the observed x - ray properties of m82 , and ( b ) the extent to which such x - ray observations and standard analysis techniques can allow us to derive the true properties of the hot plasma in these outflows .    in common with the previous simulations of ti , tb ,",
    "s94 and s96 we shall base our models largely on the nearby ( @xmath29 , freedman 1994 ) starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "m82 is the best studied starburst galaxy , and after ngc 253 and ngc 1569 , it is the closest starburst with a galactic wind . as the observational constraints on m82 s starburst and galactic wind are the best available for any starburst galaxy , we choose to concentrate on models aiming to reproduce m82 s galactic wind .",
    "the primary variables that will affect the growth and evolution of a superbubble and the eventual galactic wind in a starburst galaxy are the ism density distribution , the strength and star - formation history of the starburst , and the presence , if any , of additional interchange processes between the hot and cold phases of the ism , such as hydrodynamical or conductive mass loading .    as a detailed exploration of such a multidimensional parameter space for all possible galactic winds",
    "would be prohibitively expensive computationally , we choose to focus on simulations of m82 s galactic wind , given that is the best studied starburst galaxy . our aim",
    "to to attempt to roughly bracket the range of possible ism distributions , starburst histories and mass - loading occurring in m82 , in a series of ten simulations based on recent observational studies of this fascinating galaxy .",
    "two further simulations explore the degree to which finite numerical resolution affects our computational results .",
    "the majority of this section explores our choice of model parameters , preceded by information on the hydrodynamical code and analysis methods we use .      our simulations of starburst - driven galactic winds",
    "have been performed using virginia hydrodynamics-1 ( vh-1 ) , a high resolution multidimensional astrophysical hydrodynamics code developed by john blondin and co - workers ( see blondin 1994 ; blondin 1990 ; stevens , blondin & pollock 1992 ) .",
    "vh-1 is based on the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of collela and woodward ( 1984 ) , a third - order accurate extension of godunov s ( 1959 ) method .",
    "vh-1 is a ppm with lagrangian remap ( ppmlr ) code , in that as it sweeps through the multi - dimensional computational grid of fluid variables it remaps the fixed eulerian grid onto a lagrangian grid , solves the riemann problem at the cell interfaces , and then remaps the updated fluid variables back onto the original eulerian grid . moving to a lagrangian frame simplifies solving the riemann problem , and results in a net increase in performance over ppm codes using only an eulerian grid .",
    "for the purposes of these simulations vh-1 is run in 2-d , assuming cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and azimuthal symmetry around the @xmath31-axis .",
    "radiative cooling , mass and energy injection from the starburst region , and mass deposition due to the hydrodynamical ablation of dense unresolved clouds are incorporated using standard operator splitting techniques . as in the previous simulations of ti , tb and s94 only one quadrant of the flow is calculated , symmetry in the @xmath31 and @xmath30-axes",
    "is assumed and determines the boundary conditions that operate along these edges of the computational grid .",
    "material is allowed to flow in or out along the remaining two grid boundaries .    although dependent on the exact model parameters , we have generally us a computational grid formed of a rectangular grid of 400 uniform zone along the @xmath30-axis , covering a physical region @xmath33 long , by 800 equal - sized zones along the @xmath31-axis covering @xmath34 .",
    "simulations are run until the outermost shock of the galactic wind flows off the computational grid , typically at @xmath35  @xmath36 after the start of the starburst .",
    "our results are based on the analysis of data files of the fluid variables @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 that vh-1 produces at @xmath40 intervals .",
    "we make a distinction between the intrinsic properties of the wind ( the `` true '' gas temperatures , densities , masses , energy content and luminosities , which are described in this paper ) and the observable x - ray properties ( covered in the forthcoming companion paper ) .",
    "the observed properties need not necessarily directly reflect the true , intrinsic , wind properties due to the complications of projection , instrumental limitations and the systematic and statistical errors inherent in real observations .",
    "we analyse only the material within the wind , swept - up disk and halo ism along with enriched starburst ejecta .",
    "the undisturbed ism is ignored .",
    "quantitatively the wind is distinguished from the undisturbed ism by the shock that marks its outer boundary .",
    "the 2-d fluid variables are converted into a 3-d dataset covering both poles of the wind by making use of the assumed symmetries around the @xmath31-axis and in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the value of the fluid variables are assumed to be constant within each computational cell for the purposes of all the data analysis performed on these simulations .",
    "we do not use the parabolic interpolation used by vh-1 s hydrodynamic scheme to reconstruct the variation of the fluid variables within each cell from the cell averaged values in our data analysis . numerically summing the appropriate quantities , over those cells within the 3-d dataset that are within the region defined as being the galactic wind , gives the total integrated wind properties such as mass , volume , energy content and x - ray luminosity .",
    "x - ray properties such as emissivities or instrument - specific count rates are obtained assuming a mean mass per particle of @xmath41 and collisional ionisation equilibrium , using either the mekal hot plasma code ( mewe , kaastra & liedahl 1995 ) or an updated version of the raymond - smith plasma code ( raymond & smith 1977 ) , along with published instrument effective areas and the morrison & mccammmon ( 1983 ) absorption coefficients .",
    "in addition to studying the total integrated values of wind volume , mass , emission measure , and similar properties , we can investigate how these values are distributed as a function of gas temperature , density or velocity within the wind .",
    "many of the `` classic '' starburst galaxies with clear galactic winds such as m82 , ngc 253 , ngc 3628 and ngc 3079 are almost edge - on , allowing the low surface brightness optical and x - ray emission from the wind to be seen above the sky background .",
    "had these galaxies been face on ( the starburst galaxy m83 ) it would have been much more difficult to distinguish emission from the wind from the x - ray and optically bright disks of these galaxies .",
    "previous simulations such as tb and s94 have only considered the total properties of galactic winds integrated over the entire volume of the outflow .",
    "we feel it is important to distinguish between the properties of the gas associated with the galactic wind within the disk of the host galaxy , and the gas clearly above the disk ( in what would be observationally identified as the wind in an edge - on starburst ) .",
    "a more ambitious study might divide the wind up into several different sections , as done in strickland ( 1997 ) , but for now we will only consider two separate regions : disk or halo .",
    "the same techniques of analysis used on the entire wind described above are applied to gas within the plane or disk of the galaxy ( defined as being the region with @xmath42 ) and gas above the plane in the halo ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this allows us to study the spatial variation of the wind properties in a simple but meaningful manner .",
    "we adopt the philosophy of tb and s94 in setting up an initial ism distribution of a cool disk and hot halo , in rotating hydrostatic equilibrium under the applied gravitational field .",
    "although the ism in starburst galaxies is not static or in equilibrium , we choose a static solution to prevent the dynamics of an arbitrary non - static ism distribution from affecting the wind dynamics .",
    "the ism modeled in these 2-d numerical simulations and in ti , tb & s94 is essentially a single - phase volume filling gas .",
    "although in reality the ism of late - type galaxies is clearly multi - phase we make the assumption that the most important phase , with respect to the ism s interaction with the starburst - driven wind , is that ism component that occupies the majority of the volume . in the disk",
    "this might be cool @xmath44 gas and coronal gas in the halo .",
    "mass - loaded simulations such as s96 treat the interaction of the wind with dense , low volume filling factor clouds .",
    "although the majority of the mass in the ism is in molecular clouds these occupy only a small fraction of the total volume , even within a starburst region such as the centre of m82 .",
    "lugten ( 1986 ) find that the molecular gas within the nuclear region of m82 is comprised of small clouds , thin filaments or sheets with a total volume filling factor @xmath45 .    to investigate the effect of the ism on the collimation and confinement of the wind , and how this alters the observable x - ray properties of the galactic wind , we study two different ism distributions .",
    "we adopt tb s ism distribution as representative of a thick disk with dense cool gas high above the plane of the galaxy , which provides substantial wind collimation .",
    "the gravitational potentials used by tb and s94 do not reproduce m82 s observed rotation curve , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] .",
    "the maximal rotational velocity in tb and s94 s models is a factor two lower than that observed in m82 .",
    "consequently , with less enclosed mass , the gravitational force felt by the wind in s94 and tb s simulations is too low . for our thin disk model",
    "we remedy this by adding the potential due to a miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) disk to the stellar spheroid used in tb .",
    "the resulting disk using this combined potential is significantly thinner than that of tb .",
    "the large scale ism distribution in m82 is very poorly known , and the majority of investigations into the ism in m82 have focussed on the wind or the conditions deep within the starburst region .",
    "the current ism distribution in m82 may not be representative of the initial ism distribution prevailing at the time of the birth of the starburst .",
    "we do not claim these ism distributions used in our simulations correspond to the true ism in a starburst galaxy such as m82 , but they capture essential features which we wish to investigate , namely the effect of collimation on the wind dynamics and the resulting x - ray emission .    the initial static ism distribution is computed as a solution to the steady state momentum equation @xmath46 where @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath47 are the gas velocity , density , pressure and total gravitational potential respectively .",
    "we assume the ism is supported predominantly by rotation in the plane of the galaxy , so the rotational velocity @xmath48 ( azimuthal component of velocity ) in the plane of the galaxy is given by @xmath49 if the disk were entirely supported by rotation then @xmath50 . in these simulations",
    "a small fraction of the gravitational force in the plane is supported by the turbulent and thermal pressure of the ism . for the thick disk",
    "we choose @xmath51 , and for the thin disk @xmath52 .    to reduce the rotational velocity of the gas above the plane ( as seen in ngc 891 by swaters , sancisi & van der hulst [ 1997 ] for example ) , and have a non - rotating galactic halo we assume a simple model where the rotational support ( and hence @xmath48 ) drops off exponentially with increasing height @xmath31 above the plane of the galaxy @xmath53 where the scale height for this reduction in rotational velocity @xmath54 as used in tb .",
    "in 2-d numerical simulations such as these which assume cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath31-axis ( azimuthally symmetric ) only the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of the fluid variables @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are calculated .",

    "similarly the force required to hold the disk in equilibrium against the pressure gradient in these 2-d simulations is not just the true gravitational force @xmath57 but the effective gravitational force @xmath58 .",
    "the gravitational potential used in our thick disk model is identical to that used by tb , a single spherically symmetric component identified with the central stellar spheroid .",

    "gas is prevented from cooling below @xmath166 to prevent the artificially hot disk from cooling and collapsing .",
    "we restrict the cooling rate at unresolved interfaces between hot diffuse gas and cold dense gas , as the finite width of sharp features on the computational grid can lead to anomalously high cooling rates . at any unresolved density gradients we use the minimum volume cooling rate in the immediate vicinity ,",

    "2 .   assuming conservatively that the escape velocity @xmath215 from m82 is @xmath216 ( see for example the arguments in heckman 1999 , and m82 s rotation curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] ) , then only gas above and the right of the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbn1b_vt_mass ] _ currently _ has sufficient total energy to escape the galaxy .",
    "this gas is only 8.0 per cent ( @xmath217 ) of the total mass associated with the wind .",
    "interactions between the hot , energetic sn - ejecta phases of the wind and the ambient ism has swept - up and accelerated @xmath218 of cool gas ( @xmath219 ) up to velocities in the range @xmath220 .",
    "the concentration of mass at @xmath221 is due to minimum temperature allowed in these simulations .",
    "the distribution and dynamics of mass at temperatures lower than this limit is unknown , so the results above may overestimate the mass of gas with energy sufficient to escape . note that even these high resolution simulations ( @xmath222 ) do not have the numerical resolution necessary to resolve the structure and dynamics of gas cooler than this limit ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : results_shellthick ] ) , so there is little point in simulations with lower temperature limits that do not have significantly enhanced numerical resolution .",
    "5 .   using the temperature of the x - ray - emitting gas in starbursts to assess",
    "if this gas can escape the host galaxy ( the so - called `` escape temperature , '' wang 1995 ; martin 1999 ) will underestimate the mass of gas that can escape , as it neglects the motion of the hot gas . as discussed in section  [ sec : results_energy_budget ] , the majority of the energy in a galactic wind is in the kinetic energy of hot gas .",
    "assessing what mass of gas can escape a galaxy in the long term , based on some measure of gas energy or velocity at a particular epoch , seems extremely difficult . as the wind evolves the hot energetic gas within it will continue to entrain and accelerate cold gas .",
    "a major unknown is the effect of any halo medium ( as assumed in these simulations ) , which acts to impeded and decelerate the wind s expansion . given a dense enough halo environment none of the material in a galactic wind might escape into the igm .",
    "treating this problem numerically is challenging , given it requires high numerical resolution to resolve the interaction between cloud and wind , as well as including the physics important to wind / cloud interactions ( hydrodynamic stripping of clouds , thermal conduction , maybe even magnetic fields ? ) .    to summarise : ( a ) the mass of gas that can escape the galaxy in a starburst - driven wind is low ( perhaps a few times @xmath223 in a moderate starburst such as m82 s ) , and ( b ) winds are inefficient at transporting the ism out of galaxies .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with those of mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) or dercole & brighenti ( 1999 ) , although the outflows we have considered are 2.0  3.5 orders of magnitude more powerful than the winds of those authors .",
    "a very important aspect of any numerical hydrodynamical simulation is the degree to which the finite amount of physics included and numerical limitations ( in particular finite resolution ) influence the results .",
    "understanding these effects is difficult for even the specialist , let alone for the general astronomer .",
    "we think it is important for readers to understand the basic problems that can and do affect these and other hydrodynamical simulations . without an understanding the limitations of a simulation",
    "it is difficult to judge what results are real and what are not .",
    "we shall discuss qualitatively the effect and importance of some of the physics that is not included in these simulations .",
    "numerical artefacts , in particular related to resolution and numerical diffusion , are then discussed in some detail .",
    "finally we present a comparison between three models designed to study how the simulated properties of the hot gas in galactic winds varies as we increase the numerical resolution .        the use of an effective potential @xmath56 and the resulting effective gravity @xmath224 to maintain the ism in hydrostatic equilibrium are artefacts of a 2-d approach .",
    "a 3-dimensional code would incorporate the azimuthal velocity component without altering the gravitational field .",
    "3-d simulations would require significant increases in terms of computation resources and code development , and are difficult to justify given that the potential scientific return of 2-d simulations has barely been tapped .",
    "the use of a centrifugal potential means that the gravitational force felt by material within the galactic wind will be different from the true gravitational force it should feel . put another way ,",
    "the effective gravitational force in these simulations has been tuned to hold the ism in its initial distribution given the assumption that at any position ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) its rotational velocity @xmath48 around the @xmath31-axis and hence angular momentum is known a priori .",
    "the problem is how to treat the material within the galactic wind , given that it is a mixture of material flowing outward from the central starburst region and ambient ism swept - up and entrained into the flow .",
    "hot gas from the starburst region itself can be presumed to have almost zero angular momentum , given its origin at the centre of the galaxy and the violent dynamics of the gas .",
    "as it flows radially and vertically outward in these 2-d simulations it feels the effective , modified by assumed rotation , gravitational force , whereas it should feel only the true gravitational force",
    ".    what effect does this have on the dynamics of the material within the wind ?",
    "the effect on the very energetic free wind or shocked wind gas is negligible , as the terminal velocity of this gas is @xmath225 , so it hardly feels the gravitational field of the galaxy . the main area where problems may arise is that the dynamics and long term evolution ( over 100s of myr ) of the dense disk material dragged out of the disk and entrained into the flow ( and which is assumed to be associated with the optical emission lines observed in local starbursts such as m82 ) may well be distorted , given that typical velocities for this gas are only several hundred kilometres per second .    as a very rough estimate of the magnitude of the force required to significantly affect the dynamics of material within the galactic wind , a final velocity of @xmath226 ( a velocity slightly greater than the escape velocity and also significant in terms of the dynamics and morphology of the denser gas within the wind ) after @xmath104 of constant acceleration requires an acceleration of @xmath227 . as the difference between the true and effective gravitational fields for the thick disk ism model is typically a tenth of this value",
    ", we can conclude that the use of an effective gravitational field does not lead to a major distortion of the wind dynamics over the time - scales of the simulations we are interested in .",
    "the hot plasma emissivities used to calculate the radiative cooling and x - ray emission from these models assume the gas is in collisional ionisation equilibrium ( cie ) .    for a suddenly heated plasma ,",
    "the time required to reach ionisation equilibrium is approximately @xmath228 ( masai 1994 ) for a range of the important elements .",
    "the density and temperature structure within the wind are complex , but typical electron densities in the gas dominating the x - ray emission are of order @xmath229 , implying an ionisation time - scale of @xmath230 .",
    "although much shorter than the typical age of the wind , @xmath231 , the complex dynamical state within the wind probably means it is rare that the conditions of any parcel of gas remain unchanged for this amount of time .",
    "for example , gas returned to the ism by a sn in the starburst region is shocked within the starburst region to @xmath232 , then flows out of the starburst region in a @xmath233 wind which rapidly adiabatically cools , before passing through the reverse shock after @xmath234 and being reheated to @xmath232 .",
    "much of the soft x - ray emission within a galactic wind will be due to initially cool gas incorporated into the wind , swept up and shock heated ism , cool gas mixed into the hot wind by conduction or mass - loading and instabilities ( see section  [ sec : results_physorigin ] ) .",
    "the ionisation state of this gas will lag behind its temperature rise , as discussed by weaver ( 1977 ) .",
    "metal ions that in cie contribute significantly to the x - ray emission of plasmas with @xmath235 will in practice be under - ionised . in general",
    "then the true x - ray luminosity will be less than that obtained assuming cie .",
    "for a rapidly cooling plasma , for example the adiabatically expanding free wind or some similar region of expansion , the gas will be over - ionised with respect to its thermal temperature .",
    "the emissivity of this gas will be less than that of a gas in cie .    as a result of the complex ionisation histories of the gas within the wind",
    ", it is difficult to quantify how non - ionisation equilibrium ( nie ) effects would alter the properties of the wind from the cie case we assume .",
    "calculating the ionisation state of the gas in these simulations would require tracking the history of individual parcels of gas , and would be prohibitively expensive computationally .",
    "given that the majority of observational analysis of real x - ray spectra assumes cie in using the raymond - smith or mekal plasma codes , assuming cie in creating artificial x - ray spectra does not seem too unrealistic .",
    "systematic biases in standard x - ray spectral fitting discovered in studying the artificial x - ray observations of these wind simulations will only underestimate the true biases of fitting complex , nie x - ray spectra with simple cie spectral models .",
    "these simulations , along with the previous work of ti , tb , s94 , s96 & tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun ( 1997 ) , ignore both cosmic rays and magnetic fields , instead focusing on a totally hydrodynamic model of galactic winds .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to see if such pressure - driven winds can reproduce the observed properties ( primarily based on x - ray observations ) of the best studied galactic wind in m82 .",
    "magnetic fields and cosmic rays are known be present within the wind , but studying them is difficult and the results somewhat uncertain .",
    "magnetic fields may be important in galactic winds over large and/or small scales .",
    "large scale fields ( over 100s to 1000s of parsecs ) could potentially alter the general dynamics and expansion of the wind , for example confining its expansion in the plane of the galaxy or maybe acting to collimate it ( see sections  [ sec : results_collimation ] & [ sec : results_confinement ] ) .",
    "even if magnetic fields are not important on such large scales , any smaller scale fields associated with the clouds and clumps of ambient ism entrained into these winds could well be important .",
    "such small scale fields might alter or inhibit the hydrodynamical stripping or conductive evaporation of these clouds , and hence affect the x - ray emission from galactic winds .",
    "we can qualitatively assess the importance of large scale magnetic fields and of cosmic rays , relative to purely hydrodynamical processes , through comparison between the gas properties in our simulations and the existing observational data ( summarised below ) :    1 .",
    "seaquist & odegard ( 1991 ) estimate the total energy injection rate into the halo in the form of relativistic particles is @xmath236 .",
    "compared to the mechanical energy injection rate from the starburst in these simulations of typically @xmath237 , cosmic rays are energetically unimportant in the halo .",
    "cosmic rays also are unlikely to be an important source of non - thermal x - ray emission from the halo ( but might be important within the starburst region itself , moran & lehnert 1997 ) .",
    "2 .   klein ( 1988 ) estimate a magnetic field strength of @xmath238 within the central @xmath239 starburst region , based on the assumption of equipartition .",
    "3 .   a rotation measure analysis by reuter ( 1994 ) gives a more direct estimate of the field strength @xmath240 ( modulo uncertainties in the column density of ionised gas ) , at one position at the periphery of the main  emission , about @xmath241 to the south west of the nucleus .",
    "are fields of this range in strength dynamically important ? could such high field strengths in the starburst region constrict and confine the expansion of the wind in the plane of the galaxy ? comparing magnetic pressure ( @xmath242 ) to thermal and ram pressures within the wind provides a simple basis for comparison .",
    "a magnetic field strength of @xmath243 corresponds to @xmath244 , a field of @xmath245 to @xmath246 .    in the plane of the galaxy , where confinement of the wind s expansion is such a problem , typical thermal and ram pressures are @xmath247 and @xmath248 for the powerful starbursts we have simulated ( tbn1b , mnd_3 ) . at a height of @xmath249 above the plane of the galaxy pressures",
    "are typically lower ( @xmath250 , @xmath251 ) , but in some locations ram pressures can reach exceedingly high values ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "drawing some tentative conclusions from this , it appears that :    1 .   the estimated magnetic field strength of @xmath238 within m82 s starburst region , although high by the standards of normal galactic magnetic fields , is still somewhat lower than that required to make the magnetic field dynamically important in confining the expansion of the wind within the plane of the galaxy .",
    "2 .   if large scale field strengths are typically @xmath253 within the wind , then they are dynamically unimportant .",
    "however , if stronger large scale fields , of order @xmath238 , exist throughout the entire wind then the energy in such magnetic fields would be comparable to , or greater than , the thermal and kinetic energy of the hot gas .",
    "hence it does not appear that large scale magnetic fields are dynamically important for understanding this class of galactic - scale outflows .",
    "the question of the influence and importance of smaller scale fields in the interaction between the wind and clouds embedded within it remains open .      in common with most previous simulations we ignore thermal conduction , as it difficult to include in multidimensional hydrodynamic schemes and computationally expensive . in the standard wind - blown bubble model of weaver ( 1977 ) evaporation of the cold bubble shell by thermal conduction",
    "is the dominant source of mass in the hot bubble interior , increasing its density by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "as a result , the effects of thermal conduction on the x - ray emission from wind - blown bubbles and superbubbles are very important .    in galactic winds thermal conduction",
    "is expected to be important in regions where there are reservoirs of dense cool gas in close proximity to hot gas , such as the interface between the shocked wind and the disk within the plane of the galaxy , or in the vicinity of superbubble shell fragments within the halo .",
    "one effect of thermal conduction is to increase the density of the hot x - ray - emitting gas , in a similar manner to mass loading .",
    "indeed , mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) add additional mass into their simulations of very weak winds in dwarf galaxies to approximate the effects of conduction in a manner similar to our method of central mass loading .",
    "our mass - loading can be considered as a rough approximation to the effects of both hydrodynamical mass - loading and thermal conduction , although a rigorous treatment of thermal conduction is beyond the scope of this work .    thermal conduction , unless inhibited in some manner , might also totally evaporate the cool dense clumps and clouds seen in our simulations . as described in ferrara & shchekinov ( 1993 ) , clouds smaller than the field length ( field 1965 ) will suffer rapid conduction - driven evaporation , loosing a very substantial fraction of their mass before achieving a semi - stable configuration . for the range of temperatures and densities found in the hot gas filling",
    "the majority of the wind s volume in our simulations , the field length ranges from several hundred parsecs to several kiloparsecs , so all of the clumps seen in our simulations should suffer conductive evaporation .",
    "the net effect of conduction is difficult even to describe qualitatively .",
    "the addition of mass to the hot phases of a galactic wind will increase the x - ray emission from the wind itself , but if conduction destroys clouds totally then the net effect might be a reduction in total x - ray luminosity , given that cloud / wind interfaces appear to be such strong sources of x - ray emission in these simulations .",
    "very recently dercole & brighenti ( 1999 ) have performed a 2-d simulation of a starburst - driven wind in a dwarf galaxy ( based approximately on the dwarf starburst ngc 1569 ) that includes thermal conduction .",
    "interestingly , thermal conduction leads to an increase in the soft x - ray luminosity of this particular model by a factor of between 1 and 3 from the non - conductive case .",
    "these simulations assume all material within the wind is optically thin to its own radiation , there is no absorption intrinsic to the wind .",
    "this assumption is necessary to carry out these simulations , as coupled multidimensional radiation - hydrodynamic problems are exceedingly challenging to solve .    for emission from , and propagating through , the hot tenuous material of the wind ( free wind , shocked wind and shocked halo regions ) this assumption is reasonable .",
    "typical columns densities of the highly ionised material that would be encountered by radiation traversing the wind are in the range @xmath254  @xmath255 .    in the vicinity of cool dense clouds and the walls of the outflow within the disk , column densities become more significant .",
    "typical column densities traversing a single clump range from @xmath256  @xmath257 , depending on whether the line of sight crosses the tail or head of a clump and what the angle of incidence is .",
    "the environment around these cool dense regions is the source of the majority of soft x - ray emission ( and uv emission , which we have not discussed ) from galactic winds .",
    "photoionisation of these clouds by the energetic radiation produced through various cloud / wind interactions may well have dynamical and observational consequences .",
    "this could lead to further evaporation of the clouds , as well as to alter their ionisation state further from the collision ionisation equilibrium assumed in these calculations and in most x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "another important consequence of this will be a reduction in the x - ray emission escaping the wind , due to the absorption of a substantial fraction of the softest x - ray emission , produced at cloud / wind interfaces , by the clouds themselves .",
    "a column of @xmath255 ( assuming solar abundances , at it is the metals such as carbon , nitrogen and oxygen that dominate the photoelectric absorption cross - section ) is optically thick to radiation of energy below @xmath258 .",
    "the densest clouds , with individual columns of @xmath259 are optically thick to x - rays with energy less than @xmath260 .",
    "such a reduction in the `` escaping '' x - ray luminosity from the wind will bring the soft x - ray luminosities of our simulations into closer agreement with the observed soft x - ray luminosities of galactic winds ( section  [ sec : results_softlx ] ) .      for a structured cartesian grid as employed in these simulations the resolution is proportional to the cell size used .",
    "the properties of an unresolved structure , the cold dense superbubble shell , will be averaged out over the computational cell , as the finite volume scheme employed ensures total mass and energy within the cell are conserved correctly . for the example of a unresolved superbubble shell , the density and thickness of the shell in the simulation will respectively be less than and greater than the true values .",
    "in addition to affecting the absolute values of the fluid variables , finite numerical resolution can affect the dynamics of the fluid in other ways .",
    "consider for example the fragmentation of the superbubble shell by rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities ( s94 ) .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability time - scale is @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the wavelength .",
    "the perturbations that eventually disrupt the shell have wavelengths similar to the shell thickness , so unresolved shells are artificially stable against the rt instability , and eventually fragment into artificially large pieces .",
    "this directly effects the dynamics and properties of the coolest gas in these simulations .",
    "[ fig : res_lnum ] shows images of the logarithm of the gas number density in models tbn_1 , tbn1a ( which has cells half the size of those in model tbn_1 ) & tbn1b ( cells one third the size of those in model tbn_1 ) .",
    "it is immediately clear that the coolest densest gas in models tbn1a & tbn1b is far more structured than that in model tbn_1 , and that there are many more superbubble shell fragments being dragged out with the wind .",
    "the limitations of a finite cell size are worst for the densest , coolest gas , as it is typically found in the smallest structures .",
    "the hotter , tenuous gas , such as the thick shell of shocked halo gas or regions of shocked wind material , is on the other hand most likely to be well resolved , as it occurs in structures much larger than the cell size .",
    "nevertheless , poor numerical resolution of cool dense gas can affect the properties of the hot x - ray emitting gas we are primarily interested in .",
    "the main problems here are the artificial broadening of contact discontinuities between cool dense gas and hot tenuous gas , which creates regions of intermediate density warm gas that will produce significant amounts of soft x - ray emission , and numerical diffusion which further acts to increasingly broaden contact discontinuities and spread material over more cells with time .",
    "it is important to understand that the true resolution of a hydrodynamic simulation is not equal to the size of a single cell , but to the number of cells over which the code used can represent abrupt changes in the fluid variables such as shocks or contact discontinuities .",
    "one of the great advantages of the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) used by vh-1 it that it spreads out shocks over only two cells , a major advantage over many other numerical scheme which spread shocks out over 4  5 cells .",
    "shocks are an integral part of galactic winds , as can be seen from the many shocks visible in the gas number density images shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tbn_1_lnum ]  [ fig : mnd_4_lnum ] .    as a rough estimate of",
    "how well the densest structures in our simulations are resolved we compare the cell size to analytical estimates of the thickness of the superbubble shell before rt instabilities fragment it . a simple method of estimating the shell thickness is to use the weaver ( 1977 ) model of a constant mechanical luminosity wind blowing into a constant density medium . using the analytical solutions presented by weaver",
    ", we can calculate the total mass in the shell and its pressure , as a function of time . assuming the shell cools to the minimum temperature we allow on our computational grid , @xmath96 , the density of the shell follows directly from the pressure .",
    "given the total mass of the shell and its surface area , the shell thickness follows trivially . using the appropriate conditions that the superbubble experiences before blowout at @xmath203 in the thick disk models , the shell thickness is typically @xmath263 . comparing this to the cell size in model tbn_1 ( @xmath264 ) , model tbn1a ( @xmath265 ) and model",
    "tbn1b ( @xmath222 ) shows that the superbubble shell is under - resolved , although not drastically so .",
    "hence the shell fragmentation process and the number and size of superbubble fragments is controlled by the resolution of these simulations .",
    "note that this also means that without dramatic increases in resolution there is no point in allowing gas temperatures below the minimum gas temperature of @xmath96 we impose ( see section  [ sec : ism_distribution ] ) .",
    "a superbubble shell of temperature equivalent to the optical emission line gas observed in winds like m82 s of @xmath9 would be @xmath266 thick , and hence totally unresolved .",
    "as we have mentioned , numerical broadening of contact discontinuities will affect the properties of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "in reality physical processes such as thermal conduction and turbulent mixing layers will also create layers of intermediate temperature and density gas between cool dense gas and hot tenuous wind material .",
    "the problem with numerically broadened contact discontinuities is that their width and structure ( and hence the properties of any artificial x - ray emitting region ) is determined directly by the numerical scheme employed , and not by real physical processes .    as discussed in fryxell ( 1991 )",
    ", contact discontinuities continue to spread diffusively without limit in many eulerian hydrodynamical codes , as the contact region moves over the computational grid .",
    "they show that of a series of numerical methods ppm is the best at retaining sharp contact discontinuities . with the additional use of an contact discontinuity steepener algorithm , ppm spreads and maintains such discontinuities over a width on only two cells .",
    "vh-1 does not use such a contact discontinuity steepener , although the lagrangian remap scheme used in vh-1 is believed to be better than the eulerian ppm scheme studied by fryxell ( 1991 ) at maintaining sharp contact discontinuities without the use of a steepener ( blondin 1994 ) .",
    "we also employ a scheme similar to that used by stone & norman ( 1993 ) to reduce cooling in the region of contact discontinuities to reduce the unphysical cooling from the broadened discontinuity .",
    "although the efficient shock and discontinuity capturing within ppm mitigate the effects of finite numerical resolution , we can not totally remove such effects .      to investigate how sensitively our results depend on the numerical resolution of our models we ran three simulations using almost the same starburst and ism parameters but successively increasing the resolution .",
    "models tbn_1 and tbn1a differ only in the cell size .",
    "each computation cell in model tbn_1 representing a region @xmath267 in size , compared to cells of @xmath268 in model tbn1a .",
    "model tbn1b has triple the resolution of model tbn_1 , with cells of @xmath269 , but differs from the other thick disk models in using a cylindrical rather than spherical starburst region .",
    "the most dramatic differences between the three simulations is in the amount of structure visible in the densest coolest gas .",
    "for example , the number of superbubble shell fragments visible at @xmath213 increases significantly and their size decreases as the resolution increases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : res_lnum ] ) , for the reasons explained in section .",
    "[ sec : results_cellsize ] .",
    "otherwise the overall morphology of the wind is very similar between the different simulations , barring some minor differences in overall volume occupied by the wind .",
    "the properties of the x - ray emitting gas , whether measured in terms of the distribution of volume , average density , emission measure or emitted x - ray flux as a function of temperature , are all very similar between the three models when measured at the same epoch ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : res_tkev ] and table  [ tab : main_results ] ) .",
    "concentrating on the properties most important observationally , the emission measure and _ rosat _ pspc count rates , the agreement between the different models is excellent at gas temperatures above @xmath270 . for gas with temperatures below this ,",
    "the higher resolution models predict systematically less emitting material and less x - ray flux .",
    "this is consistent with a picture of some , although not necessarily all , of the x - ray emission from gas at these lower temperatures being due to numerically broadened contact discontinuities .",
    "the only other significant difference between these models we have found is in the filling factors of the x - ray dominant gas ( table  [ tab : ffactors ] ) , where model tbn_1 has a much lower filling factor than models tbn1a & tbn1b .",
    "we do not believe the filling factors of the most of the other models are as dependent on numerical resolution as model tbn_1 .",
    "in particular , in the thin disk models the x - ray emission is not purely from such interface regions ( where numerically broadened contact discontinuities are such a problem ) , so increased numerical resolution should not lead to order of magnitude increases in the filling factor of the x - ray dominant gas .",
    "the models where the properties of the x - ray dominant gas are most likely to be affected by resolution effects are models tbn_1 , tbn_2 , tbn_7 and mnd_6 .",
    "this is based on the number of computational cells the most x - ray luminous gas covers ( the gas contributing 90 per cent of the soft x - ray counts in the _ rosat _ band ) , which is much lower in these models than in any of the other models .    comparing the intrinsic x - ray luminosities in the _ rosat _ @xmath16  @xmath17 energy band",
    "as a function of time between the three models also shows progressively lower x - ray luminosity accompanies higher numerical resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_lx ] ) .",
    "this figure probably exaggerates the importance of the variation in x - ray luminosity with resolution , as what can be measured in reality will be the count rate of the attenuated emission , where the influence of the low temperature gas so affected by numerical effects is significantly reduced .",
    "there will be much less difference between the `` observable '' x - ray properties of these models than in their intrinsic x - ray luminosities .",
    "the coolest gas in these simulations is not resolved , and would require quite substantial further increases in numerical resolution to resolve if it were allowed to cool to @xmath9 . the dramatic increase in the complexity of the structures associated with the coolest gas with increasing resolution",
    "does suggest to us that the complex filamentary structure of the optical emission line gas observed in galactic winds ( mckeith 1995 ; lehnert & heckman 1996 ; shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) will be produced as a natural consequence of these models , once they achieve the necessary resolution .",
    "the level of variation found between these three simulations implies that in these simulations , including the other thick and thin disk models , the emission properties of the low filling factor warm gas responsible for the majority of the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath271 ) are partially controlled by unresolved , numerically broadened , warm gas interfaces between cool dense gas and hotter wind material .",
    "nevertheless , the important finding that the x - ray dominant gas has low filling factor ( @xmath272 per cent ) , is likely to be robust .",
    "hotter gas within these winds ( @xmath273 ) , in particular volume filling components , seems well resolved , even in our lowest resolution simulations and therefore its properties are reasonably quantitatively correct .",
    "we have performed an extensive parameter study of starburst - driven galactic winds using a high resolution 2-d hydrodynamical code , focusing on the best studied galactic wind in m82 .",
    "these simulations allow us to study how the properties of galactic winds vary depending on the influence of the host galaxy s ism distribution , starburst strength and star formation history , and the presence or absence of additional mass - loading from clouds enveloped in the wind .    in this paper",
    "we have used this sample of twelve simulations to investigate several aspects of galactic winds that are uncertain or have previously received little attention : the origin and filling factor of the gas responsible for the observed soft x - ray emission ; wind energetics and energy transport efficiencies and wind collimation and growth .",
    "in addition we have explored in detail the influence of finite numerical resolution on the results of these simulations .        1 .",
    "thick ism disks are required to reproduce the well collimated wind observed in m82 .",
    "thin disk models ( suchkov 1994 ) have wind opening angles that are too large , @xmath274 .",
    "thick disk models , such as that used by tomisaka & bregman ( 1993 ) , are much better collimated , with typical opening angles @xmath275 , much closer to the observed value of @xmath276 .",
    "2 .   all the simulations , regardless of ism distribution or star formation history , fail to confine the size of the wind in the plane of the galaxy to the observed size of roughly the size of the starburst region ( @xmath277 in m82 ) .",
    "the radius of the wind in the plane of the galaxy grows to between 1  2 kpc over the 10 myr period covered by these simulations .",
    "the confinement of galactic winds within the plane of the galaxy remains a problem , as initially pointed out by tenorio - tagle & muoz - tun ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is clearly something interesting happening in the central regions of starburst galaxies , perhaps related to the existing circum - nuclear molecular rings , that must be able confine the base of the wind over time - scales of @xmath278 .      1 .",
    "the gas responsible for the majority of the soft x - ray emission detectable by _ rosat _ comes from very low filling factor ( @xmath279 to @xmath280 per cent ) gas that contains very little of the total mass or energy of the wind . as a result x - ray observations with _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ or _ xmm _ will only give lower limits on the mass and energy content of galactic winds .",
    "2 .   the winds in these models contain gas at a wide range of temperatures and densities . in terms of a phase description",
    "there is a phase continuum of states rather than any particular well defined characteristic temperatures or densities .",
    "the majority of the wind volume in almost all of these models is filled with hot gas , covering the temperature range @xmath281 to @xmath282 .",
    "this gas is only a weak source of soft x - ray emission due to its low density .",
    "the soft x - ray emission in these models does not come from any single well - defined temperature gas , but from a very wide range of temperatures from @xmath0 to @xmath283 .",
    "fitting the resulting complex x - ray spectra with standard simple spectral models is likely to give misleading results",
    ". 5 .   in all of our models , regions of interaction between the hot wind and cooler denser material ( originally part of the ambient ism ) give rise to a large fraction of the soft x - ray emission . in these simulations",
    "this x - ray emission can be from shock - heated ambient gas , and from the numerically broadened interfaces between cool dense and hot tenuous gas , although it is very difficult to discriminate between the two cases . in some of the models , in particular the mass - loaded models",
    ", the starburst region itself or the free wind region can be significant sources of soft x - ray emission . in the thin disk models shock - heated halo gas is also an important source of x - ray emission .",
    "the primary variable affecting the soft x - ray luminosity of the galactic winds in these models is the density and distribution of the ambient , volume - filling , component of the ism .",
    "the energy injection rate from the starburst , and mass - loading from dense clouds , do have a significant but secondary effect on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "mass - loading of the wind , either within the starburst region itself , or from clouds distributed more generally throughout the ism , is not necessary to produce galactic winds of m82 s luminosity or characteristic soft x - ray temperature .",
    "hard x - ray emission from galactic winds is dominated by the starburst region itself .",
    "the ratio of hard x - ray to soft x - ray luminosity is typically @xmath284 .",
    "we confirm s94 s conclusion that the hard x - ray emission from starburst galaxies is _ not _ due to thermal emission associated with the starburst - driven wind .",
    "1 .   galactic winds are efficient at transporting the energy supplied by the starburst out of the plane of the galaxy . as radiative losses are low , galactic winds seem likely to be good sources of heating for the igm and icm .",
    "this is in contrast to their low efficiency at moving mass out of the disk of starburst galaxies . 2 .",
    "the energy within galactic winds is predominantly ( @xmath285 per cent ) kinetic energy of hot gas ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "this is significantly different from the standard superbubble , where the majority of the energy is in the thermal energy of the hot bubble interior .",
    "the change from thermally - dominated to kinetically - dominated energetics occurs when the superbubble breaks out of the disk .",
    "hot gas also contains the majority ( @xmath285 per cent ) of the total thermal energy content of these winds .",
    "exceptions to this rule are models with strong centralised mass - loading , where warm gas ( @xmath287 ) dominates the thermal energy content .",
    "the total energy content of galactic winds appears extremely difficult to measure directly : soft x - ray observations probe only denser low filling factor gas containing relatively little ( @xmath3 per cent ) of either the total thermal or kinetic energy .",
    "measuring the kinetic energy of the warm and hot phases is also hampered by the lack of any direct measurements of this gas s velocity .",
    "our findings have major implications for the ultimate aim behind the study of galactic winds : measuring quantitatively the transport of mass , metal - enriched gas and energy out of star - forming galaxies .",
    "these simulations measure , for the first time , the observationally important filling factor of the x - ray emitting gas . in all models , even those including different forms of mass - loading , we find that the soft x - ray emission from galactic winds comes from low filling factor ( @xmath2 per cent ) gas .",
    "this gas contains only a small fraction of the mass and energy of the wind .",
    "the majority of the thermal and kinetic energy of these outflows is in a hot , volume filling , component , which is extremely difficult to probe observationally due to its low density and hence low emissivity .",
    "we also find that galactic winds are efficient at transporting energy out of the host galaxy , primarily in the form of the kinetic energy of hot , @xmath288 to @xmath282 , gas .",
    "this is an important finding , as it suggests that starburst - driven winds are a good mechanism for reheating the igm and icm , as required by recent observations .    in paper",
    "ii we shall present a direct comparison between the spectral properties and spatial distribution of the soft x - ray emission in these models and the existing x - ray data on m82 , along with a discussion of which of these models best reproduces m82 s observed properties .",
