    "the natural question is then : how robust are those results , i.e. , the  0.5 \" plateau in the conductance , in the presence of the coulomb repulsion in the dot ?",
    "in particular , how is the conductance plateau produced solely by a majorana mode in the noninteracting dot of our earlier work modified by the coulomb interaction in the dot , especially in the kondo regime ?",
    "recent studies have addressed the kondo regime of a quantum dot coupled to a topological wire and to normal fermi liquid leads@xcite and to luttinger leads.@xcite an important distinction among these studies is whether the topological superconducting wire is grounded or `` floating''.@xcite our present work and that of lee _ et al_. in ref .   consider a floating wire and , with the majorana mode coupled to the qd spin down degree of freedom , obtain @xmath22 and @xmath23 , giving a total conductance of @xmath24 in the kondo - majorana regime . in ref .",

    "the robust pinning @xmath26 that we find in the present work for the interacting case corroborates the results of our previous work@xcite and establishes their validity in the interacting case .",
    "none of the previous studies have focused on the pinning at `` 0.5 '' of the qd conductance as the signature of the leaked majorana mode in the interacting dot or on the the influence of gate voltages and external magnetic fields on the majorana - kondo physics .",
    "these are the central goals of our present work .",
    "to address the questions in the previous paragraphs , in this paper we perform a thorough study of the normal - lead  qd  quantum wire system shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) .",
    "we start off with a realistic model for the wire that explicitly accounts for the rashba spin ",
    "orbit interaction , proximity @xmath17-wave superconductivity , and a zeeman term used to drive the wire from its trivial to its topological phase .",
    "we study this model with a recursive green s function method , using a decoupling procedure known as hubbard i approximation.@xcite this scheme allows us to describe the behavior of the qd for a wide range of parameters in both the trivial and topological phases of the wire .",
    "however , the hubbard i approximation is known to fail when describing the low ",
    "temperature regime,@xcite hence a nonperturbative treatment is needed .",
    "for this purpose we employ the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) . because treating the full quantum wire within the nrg is inviable",
    ", we adopt a low  energy effective hamiltonian,@xcite in which the realistic wire in its topological phase is replaced by only two majorana end modes .",
    "we find that in the interacting case , within the hubbard i approximation , the pinning of the majorana peak persists for a wide range of gate voltages as long as the dot is empty .",
    "however , in the single ",
    "occupancy regime of the dot , our mean  field calculations predict that the pinning will be suppressed by coulomb blockade when the spin up / down states are degenerate . by applying a large zeeman field in the qd",
    ", we drive it into a spinless regime in which coulomb blockade does not take place and the non  interacting character of the dot is restored with the pinning appearing for both occupied and unoccupied dot as described by our results in fig .",
    "1(g ) of ref .  .    at low temperatures ,",
    "in the absence of external zeeman splitting in the dot , our nrg results show that the majorana peak in fact appears also in the single ",
    "occupancy regime , in agreement with previous nrg studies.@xcite the `` leaked '' majorana mode coexists with the kondo effect for a qd at the particle ",
    "hole symmetric point , giving a total zero  bias conductance of @xmath24.@xcite in this situation , we also find that the majorana ",
    "qd coupling strongly enhances the kondo temperature .",
    "in contrast , detuning from the particle ",
    "hole symmetric point strongly suppresses the kondo peak because of an effective zeeman splitting induced in the qd by the majorana mode.@xcite however , the `` 0.5 '' majorana signature is immune to the zeeman splitting in the qd , so , far from the particle - hole symmetric point the `` 0.5 '' conductance plateau is restored .",
    "further , the kondo effect can be progressively quenched ( even at the particle ",
    "hole symmetric point ) by an external magnetic field . in this case",
    "the resulting zero  bias conductance _ versus _ zeeman energy follows a well  known universal curve .",
    "this universal behavior of the conductance for low magnetic fields and the persistent @xmath27 zero  bias conductance at large magnetic fields are unique pieces of evidence of the majorana ",
