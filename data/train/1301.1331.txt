    "debris disks were discovered by _ iras _ as infrared excess emission arising from systems of particles analogous to enhanced kuiper belts .",
    "they are tenuous dusty disks sustained by cometary activity and planetesimal collisions , which initiate cascades of further collisions that break bodies down into fine dust @xcite .",
    "the dust is lost relatively quickly through photon pressure , poynting - robertson ( p - r ) or stellar - wind drag forces , generally in a time scale much shorter than 10@xmath6 yr .",
    "thus , a debris - disk - generated infrared excess requires the presence of colliding planetesimals , and a larger object ( can be as small as pluto - size ) to stir them , i.e. , some form of planetary system @xcite .",
    "the large emitting area of debris makes these disks detectable through infrared / sub - millimeter thermal emission or optical scattered light , providing insights into the nature of unseen parent - body populations and massive perturbers around other stars .",
    "the dust around a host star absorbs stellar radiation and re - emits in the infrared at equilibrium temperatures , balanced between absorption and emission .",
    "consequently , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the infrared excesses and its relation to the dust temperatures can be used to infer the number of emitting grains and their distances from the heating star .",
    "for example , excesses in the near - infrared near 2 @xmath0  should be dominated by dust at @xmath11500 k , excesses in the mid - infrared near 24 @xmath0  should be dominated by dust at @xmath1120150 k , while excesses in the far - infrared are mostly from dust at @xmath150 k. furthermore , excess emission at shorter wavelengths also contributes excess at longer wavelengths as rayleigh - jeans ( a steep function of wavelengths ) .    identifying excess emission around a star requires a good knowledge of stellar photospheric properties and extrapolation to long wavelengths .",
    "positive identifications of excesses at long wavelengths are easier than at shorter wavelengths where the host star dominates , unless the signal of the star can be filtered out through interferometric techniques .",
    "there is also a concern whether excesses at mid - infrared and far - infrared are tracing separate components since the majority of debris disks are unresolved . for nearby systems , modern facilities like _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ have sufficient resolution to resolve the detailed structures of the disk and reveal the complexity in disk structures in a few cases .",
    "the identification of a warm excess in these resolved systems requires precise subtraction of the stellar photosphere in the resolved images , which has been done for the fomalhaut @xcite , @xmath2 eri @xcite , and hr 8799 @xcite systems .",
    "ironically , some of the nearby resolved systems are saturated in the mid - infrared , making the recognition of such a component very challenging .    in this paper , we present mid - infrared spectroscopic studies centered at the two nearby a - type stars vega and fomalhaut obtained with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) instrument and we identify warm excess emission in the vicinity of the star , clearly separated from the much brighter cold planetesimal belts that dominate the far - infrared emission .",
    "we suggest the presence of a planetesimal belt near the water - frost line of the vega system for the first time .",
    "we compare its properties with the warm excess around fomalhaut @xcite .",
    "we discuss the properties of the warm excesses complemented with resolved infrared and submillimeter images of both systems .",
    "two other spatially resolved debris systems , @xmath2 eri @xcite and hr 8799 @xcite , are also known to possess a similar warm belt that is fainter and clearly separated from the more prominent cold belt using a similar approach .",
    "these warm components may be analogous to our asteroid belt , but of far greater mass .",
    "we discuss the implications and origins of this two - belt configuration in light of the similarity in dust temperature distribution found around unresolved debris systems between solar - like and early - type stars by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 , including both _",
    "irs spectroscopy and _ herschel _ pacs imaging .",
    "photospheric determination using ancillary data is given in section 3.1 where we conclude that no significant excess is found from 2.2 to 8 @xmath0  for both systems .",
    "using the pacs 70 and 160 @xmath0  images , we estimate the excess flux of the unresolved source centered at the star position for vega in section 3.2 and section 3.3 for fomalhaut .",
    "we construct the seds of the unresolved excess components along with other mid - infrared and submillimeter measurements , and suggest that they arise from a planetesimal belt placed near the water - frost line in section 4 . in section 5 , we discuss the implication of the two - belt systems on the underlying planetary configuration , and provide a possible explanation for the 2 @xmath0  excess in the vega system .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "to avoid saturation , we only used data taken in the irs high - resolution ( r@xmath1600 ) modules ( short - high ( sh ) : 9.919.6 @xmath0  and long - high ( lh ) : 18.737.2 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the sizes of the slits are 47@xmath7113 and 111@xmath7223 for the sh and lh modules , respectively ; a significant fraction of the light from a point source is outside the slit .",
    "standard slit loss correction for a point source was applied to the extracted spectra ; therefore , the part of the spectrum where a point source dominates the emission has the correct spectral shape .",
    "[ irs_vega ]    irs sh and lh spectral mapping data centered at the position of vega have been obtained through irs calibration programs ( pid 1406 , 1409 , 1411 , and 1413 ) in 2004 . here",
    "we present six sets of observations where the slit was placed on the vega position based on pcrs pointing information ( no irs peakup ) .",
    "these data were taken in the spectral mapping mode with two positions parallel to the slit ( 747 step@xmath8 ) and three positions perpendicular to the slit direction ( 1step@xmath8 ) ; we only used the ones taken at the center perpendicular position ( two positions along the slit center ) .",
    "we used the smart software ( v.8.2.5 ; @xcite ) to reduce the bcd products from the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) pipeline version of s18.18 .",
    "each of the spectra was extracted with the full - slit mode without sky subtraction , flux calibrated to a point source using the s18.18 calibration , and shown in figure [ irs_vega ] .",
    "we then pinned all the sh spectra to 35.03 jy at 10.6 @xmath0  according to the absolute calibration scale defined in @xcite , and shifted the corresponding lh spectra ( a scale factor of 0.975 ) to join smoothly with the sh ones .",
    "the final spectrum was obtained as a weighted average of these six aors ( black dashed line in figure [ irs_vega ] ) .",
    "[ irs_vega_fom ]    the fomalhaut system was observed with the _ spitzer _ irs instrument in program pid 90 in 2004 june and november .",
    "again , we only report here the observations with the irs sh and lh modules , due to saturation of the signal in the low - resolution modules . in irs sh",
    ", we obtained a standard staring - mode nodded observation , with on - target integration time of 503 s. this observation was preceded by a high - accuracy pointing peakup on a nearby star with no infrared excess , hd 216922 , using the irs blue ( 1319 @xmath0 ) peakup camera . with irs",
    "lh we obtained spectral - mapping observations with a strip of nine slit positions separated in the dispersion direction by 48  and centered on fomalhaut .",
    "the integration time per slit position was 122 s. the spectral mapping exercise was preceded by a moderate - accuracy irs pointing peakup using the red ( 1926 @xmath0 ) camera and hd 216922 .",
    "spectra at the extremes of the spectral map indicated that sky emission is negligible compared to that by fomalhaut , so no sky subtraction was performed on the center - position spectrum we discuss here .",
    "data reduction began with basic calibrated data products of the irs data pipeline , version s11 . from these data we removed , by interpolation in the spectral direction , permanently bad and `` rogue '' pixels identified in the irs dark - current data for all observing campaigns up to and including the one in which each fomalhaut spectrum was taken .",
    "again we used smart for full - slit extractions of spectra from the two - dimensional data .",
    "similar observations were made of @xmath9 lac ( a1 v ) in irs sh and @xmath10 dra ( k1 iii ) .",
    "along with template spectra for these stars provided by m. cohen ( 2004 , private communication ) , we used these observations to construct relative spectral response functions ( rsrfs ) for each spectrometer , and in turn used these rsrfs to calibrate the fomalhaut spectra .",
    "we estimate the resulting spectrophotometric accuracy to be approximately 5% .    the final combined , smoothed spectra for both systems are shown in figure [ irs_vega_fom ] .",
    "for comparison , the stellar photospheric models ( details see section [ stellar ] ) are also shown .",
    "given the geometry of the outer cold rings ( radius of 20  in the fomalhaut system @xcite and radius of 11  in the vega system @xcite ) and the sizes of point spread functions ( psfs ) in the irs wavelengths , the spectral flux beyond @xmath130 @xmath0  is partially contaminated by the cold ring .",
    "the spectral shape and flux level shortward of @xmath130 @xmath0  are mostly from the star and any unresolved inner warm component .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the observed spectrum between 10 and 13 @xmath0  agrees well with the expected stellar photosphere . the excess spectrum ( after stellar photospheric subtraction )",
    "is also shown in the lower panel for both systems in figure [ irs_vega_fom ] .",
    "_ herschel _ pacs 70 and 160 @xmath0  data for vega and fomalhaut were obtained by the gt program and published in an early reduction by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we retrieved the archival data and reduced them with the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe , v9.0 user release , @xcite ) .",
    "we applied the standard processing steps up to the level 1 stage . during this process",
    "we applied 2nd level deglitching to remove outliers with `` timeordered '' option and 20@xmath11 threshold .",
    "this is very effective for data with high levels of coverage . after producing level 1 data",
    ", we selected the science frames from the time - line by applying spacecraft - speed selection criteria ( between 8s@xmath8 and 12s@xmath8 for the slow scan , and 18s@xmath8 and 22s@xmath8for the median scan ) .",
    "the final level 2 mosaics were generated using highpass filtering with the script `` photproject '' and a pixel scale of 1  at 70 @xmath0  and 2  at 160 @xmath0 . to avoid flux loss in the highpass filtering process",
    ", we applied a circular mask of 60  radius centered on the position of the target .",
    "since the pacs data on vega and fomalhaut were obtained with different scan rates ( 10s@xmath8 and 20s@xmath8 , respectively ) , psf observations matched to the observing parameters should be used for comparison .",
    "we used pacs data on @xmath9 boo ( obsid 1342247634 and 1342247635 ) and @xmath9 tau ( obsid 1342214211 and 1342214212 ) as our psf reference and reduced them using the same reduction procedure including the masking radius .",
    "these two stars are ones of the pacs primary calibrators where their fluxes and psf behaviors are characterized by @xcite .",
    "we have made sure these psf stars have the consistent encircled energy fraction as a function of circular aperture radius derived by the pacs point - source calibration @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the major features seen in the pacs images , we show the final 70 @xmath0  mosaics of vega and fomalhaut in figure [ pacs70_images ] along with the comparison psfs .",
    "in this section , we first review all ancillary photometry to establish the fidelity of photospheric spectrum for vega and fomalhaut .",
    "we then assess whether the excess emission detected in the irs spectrum is also detected in the resolved _ herschel _ pacs 70 and 160 @xmath0  images .",
    "since the stellar photospheres dominate the emission in the central part of the resolved images at 70 @xmath0  where the systems are best resolved , cares must be taken in estimating the contribution of a central dust component without involving any further assumption of modeling .",
    "we do this in two ways : ( 1 ) with photometry using small apertures that exclude spatially extended emission and ( 2 ) with psf subtraction using reference stars to minimize the residuals at the star position .",
    "the first approach provides an estimate of the maximum error on the central component due to contamination from other dust emission located in a more spatially extended distribution .",
    "the second approach provides a more accurate estimate of the flux of an unresolved source . in both systems ,",
    "the pacs 160 @xmath0  images provide only upper limits because the lower angular resolution at this longer wavelength makes it difficult to spatially differentiate the components .",
    "[ pacs70_images ]      the emission of the stellar photosphere from optical to mid - ir ( @xmath18 @xmath0 ) was determined in a number of steps .",
    "most infrared photometry measurements ( like _ spitzer_/irac and _ akari _ ) are referred to vega , although vega is unsatisfactory as a standard ( i.e. , fast - rotating , infrared excess ) .",
    "however , these missions also measured sirius using the same technique , so we have taken the measurements with nominal uncertainties of 0.01 mag directly compared to sirius in terms of magnitude differences .",
    "sirius ( a1v ) is very similar in spectral type to vega ( a0v ) and fomalhaut ( a4v ) , and is well behaved in the infrared with no evidence for an infrared excess @xcite .",
    "all three stars are severely saturated in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data .",
    "therefore , for accurate measurements at 2.2 @xmath0 , we used data from the dirbe instrument on _ cobe_. the reduction of these data is described by @xcite for analyzing stellar variability . due to the large dirbe beam ( 42@xmath742 ) , the contribution from stars in the field surrounding the target of interest needs to be removed .",
    "we evaluated this effect using 2mass data , making sirius fainter by 0.014 mag and fomalhaut fainter by 0.003 mag while the contribution in the vega field is negligible .",
    "both vega and fomalhaut are reported to have @xmath12-band excess at 1.29%@xmath130.19% @xcite and 0.88%@xmath130.12% @xcite above the photosphere using interferometry .",
    "after accounting for these @xmath12-band excesses of vega and fomalhaut , the @xmath12-band magnitude difference for photospheres between fomalhaut and sirius is 2.35 mag , and 1.39 mag between vega and sirius . for measurements in the irac bands , we adopted the results from @xcite who used psf fitting technique to recover accurate photometry for saturated sources .",
    "the magnitude differences between fomalhaut and sirius are 2.36 mag , 2.36 mag , 2.36 mag , and 2.33 mag at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 , respectively ( to be discussed further by espinoza et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the magnitude differences between vega and sirius are 1.38 mag , 1.38 mag , 1.38 mag , and 1.35 mag at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , _ midcourse space experiment _",
    "( _ msx  _ ) also measured both vega and sirius .",
    "the measured 8 @xmath0  flux of vega is lower by 1% compared to the _ msx _ predicted flux based on the measurement of sirius @xcite .",
    "we adopt a magnitude difference of 1.36 mag at 8 @xmath0  between vega and sirius .    with the nominal uncertainty for these measurements ( 0.01 mag ) , there is no evidence for excesses from 2.2 to 8 @xmath0  ( after excluding the @xmath12-band excesses from interferometric measurements ) for both systems .",
    "we used appropriate kurucz atmospheric models for photospheric predictions in other wavelengths by normalizing the model fluxes from 2.2 to 8 @xmath0  to the measured photometry that has been transferred to the absolute calibration scale proposed by @xcite .",
    "the parameters in the kurucz model are @xmath14 k and log  @xmath154.0 for vega , and @xmath16 k and log  @xmath154.0 for fomalhaut . given the accurate _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements @xcite , the integrated luminosity is 17.45 @xmath17 for fomalhaut and 56.05 @xmath17 for vega ( viewing from pole - on ) .",
    "using these normalized kurucz models , we can then predict the photospheric level at the wavelengths of interest and determine the excess near the stars by subtracting off the stellar contribution from the irs spectra presented in section [ irsobs ] .",
    "note that the kurucz models in the infrared wavelengths are basically in the rayleigh - jeans regime .",
    "the vega system is viewed pole - on , and its disk has been resolved at various wavelengths previously @xcite . as shown in figure [ pacs70_images ] , the pacs 70 @xmath0  image appears to be centrally peaked with a smoothed , axis - symmetric extended halo .",
    "the size of the vega cold disk observed in the higher resolution _ herschel _ data @xcite agrees with the one observed in the _ spitzer _ data @xcite .",
    "the stellar photosphere is about 0.81 jy at 70 @xmath0 , consistent with the centrally peaked morphology seen at that wavelength .",
    "the fwhm of the central source is 56@xmath753 measured on a field of 21@xmath721  centered on the star , which is slightly more extended than the measured fwhm of the psf star , @xmath9 boo ( 55@xmath752 ) . to minimize the influence of the cold ring ( peaked at radius of @xmath11114 , see figure [ pacs_profile_vega ] ) in estimating the photometry of the central source , small aperture sizes with appropriate aperture corrections",
    "should be used . on the other hand ,",
    "the aperture has to be large enough to contain most of the flux and to minimize the centroid uncertainty .",
    "we tried several aperture settings from 3  to 55 ( fwhm ) with and without a sky annulus and used the psf star @xmath9 boo to derive the values of aperture correction .",
    "the resultant fluxes range from 1.00 jy to 1.62 jy with a median value of 1.01 jy ( using an aperture of 5  and sky annulus between 5and 7 ) . at 160 @xmath0 ,",
    "the beam ( fwhm ) is 116@xmath7101 ( measured from @xmath9 boo ) , making it very difficult to estimate the photometry of the central source alone without significant contamination from the flux of the cold ring .",
    "a 5  aperture without sky annulus gives a total flux of 0.56 jy , which should be considered as an upper limit since it contains some fraction of the cold ring contribution .",
    "the photosphere of vega is 0.15 jy at 160 @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the excess flux at the star position , based on small aperture photometry , is 0.2 jy at 70 @xmath0  and @xmath180.4 jy at 160 @xmath0 .",
    "[ pacs_profile_vega ]    to illustrate our psf - subtraction approach , cuts were made along pa of 120  ( corresponding to the horizontal axis of the displayed image ) of the vega system with the nw side on the negative side of the @xmath19-axis .",
    "these cuts , shown in figure [ pacs_profile_vega ] , were centered at the stellar position at 70 @xmath0 , and represented the mean value over a width of 5 pixels ( i.e. , 5  and 10  at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively ) .",
    "no significant asymmetry in disk brightness nor center offset were seen in these cuts .",
    "after subtracting a photospheric scaled @xmath9 boo psf , an additional point - like source is clearly present in the resultant cut ( blue dashed line in figure [ pacs_profile_vega ] ) at 70 @xmath0 . the maximum of the point - source contribution ( star and unresolved disk ) can be estimated by forcing the peak values ( single pixel ) matched between the vega and @xmath9 boo data . a flux density of 1.19 jy for such a psf subtraction is required and its resultant profile is shown as the thin solid blue line in figure [ pacs_profile_vega ] , suggesting a maximum brightness of @xmath180.38 jy for this unresolved disk at 70 @xmath0 . using the flux obtained with the small aperture photometry ( 0.2 jy for the unresolved disk )",
    ", the resultant profile is shown as blue dotted - dashed line in figure [ pacs_profile_vega ] , relatively flat in the central @xmath135  region as expected .",
    "therefore , the brightness of the unresolved disk in the vega system is @xmath10.2 jy with a maximum value @xmath180.38 at 70 @xmath0 . due to the uncertainty of the psf ( as much as 10% at 70 @xmath0 ; @xcite ) and that of flux calibration , we simply assume a conservative lower - bound error of 20% ( i.e. , a minimum flux of 0.16 jy at 70 @xmath0  for the central unresolved disk ) .",
    "at 160 @xmath0 , the maximum scaled psf is @xmath10.45 jy by forcing the peak value to zero , suggesting a maximum brightness of @xmath180.3 jy for this unresolved disk component .",
    "[ pacs_profile_fom ]      since the fomalhaut debris system is inclined by 67 , it is very difficult to separate the point source from the cold ring even using very small apertures .",
    "one can still estimate the maximum brightness of the unresolved component by assuming there is no contamination from other sources inside a very small aperture .",
    "for an aperture radius of 3 , the encircled flux is 0.95 jy at 70 @xmath0  and 0.77 jy at 160 @xmath0  after applying appropriate aperture corrections . taking out the contribution of the stellar photosphere ( 0.368 jy and 0.07 jy at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively , based on our stellar photospheric model )",
    ", the unresolved disk component has a maximum flux of @xmath180.58 jy and @xmath180.7 jy at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "similar to vega , cuts were made along the major - axis of the disk and shown in figure  [ pacs_profile_fom ] .",
    "these cuts were centered at the stellar position at 70 @xmath0 , and represented the mean value over a width of 4 pixels ( i.e. , 4  and 8  at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively ) .",
    "the center of the outer cold ring ( the dashed , vertical line in figure [ pacs_profile_fom ] ) was estimated by the mid - point of the two bright peaks ( marked as dotted , vertical lines for 70 @xmath0  and dot - dashed , vertical lines for 160 @xmath0  in figure [ pacs_profile_fom ] ) at both wavelengths .",
    "the 160 @xmath0  ansae peak closer to the ring center than the ones at 70 @xmath0 , which was first reported by @xcite and suggested to be due to blurring in the large psf at 160 @xmath0 . although the peak positions at 70 and 160 @xmath0  are not the same , the cold ring centers at the same position at both 70 and 160 @xmath0 .",
    "we used a psf star , @xmath9 tau , for photospheric subtraction by scaling it to match the expected photospheres ( 0.368 jy and 0.07 jy at 70 and 160 @xmath0 ) .",
    "the photosphere - subtracted cuts are shown in long - dashed lines in figure  [ pacs_profile_fom ] . at 70 @xmath0 ,",
    "it is clear that an additional source of emission is present at the center of the disk .",
    "we tried two different psf subtractions to estimate the brightness of this additional component .",
    "first , we arbitrarily increased the scaling of @xmath9 tau , fixed in the stellar photosphere position , until the central region ( from @xmath205  to @xmath215  ) has a relatively flat distribution in the cut .",
    "the resultant cut is shown as a thin solid blue line with an additional scale of 0.17 jy .",
    "second , we subtract a second @xmath9 tau psf by adjusting both the position and the scaling until the resultant cut is relatively flat ( dot - dashed line in figure [ pacs_profile_fom ] ) . the second method gives a scale of 0.165 jy for this additional source .",
    "combining both methods , we conclude that the central unresolved component is 0.17 jy at 70 @xmath0 .",
    "there is no easy way to estimate the error associated with this number since it depends on the detailed structures of various components , we simply assume a 20% error for further analysis . at 160 @xmath0 , it is not obvious that an additional source is required in the system .",
    "we estimated the upper limit of such a component by increasing the scaling factor of @xmath9 tau fixed at the star position ( any potential offset between the star and this inner component is washed out by the large beam size at 160 @xmath0 ) .",
    "an upper limit of 0.08 jy at 160 @xmath0  was inferred .    in summary ,",
    "the central unresolved disk component in the fomalhaut system is about 0.17 jy at 70 @xmath0  with upper- and lower - bound fluxes of 0.58 jy and 0.136 jy ( assuming 20% uncertainty ) , and @xmath180.08 jy at 160 @xmath0 , based on the analysis of the data only ( without invoking any assumption of modeling ) .",
    "our values are consistent with the best - fit model presented in @xcite .",
    "their model estimates that the fluxes of the central point source ( star + unresolved disk component ) are 0.54 jy ( 5% of the total flux ) and 0.124 jy ( 2% of the total flux ) at 70 and 160 @xmath0 , respectively , implying that the unresolved disk accounts for flux of 0.172 jy at 70 @xmath0  and 0.054 jy at 160 @xmath0 .",
    "the vega _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0  observation @xcite was severely saturated , making it difficult to constrain the brightness of this unresolved component without invoking some modeling assumptions .",
    "therefore , we seek other relevant measurements in the mid - infrared to validate the excess levels seen in the irs spectrum . @xcite measured a handful of nearby a - type stars at 20 @xmath0  using the irtf bolometer with a beam size of 5  to define the 20 @xmath0  magnitude system ( relative to vega ) .",

    "the maximum fraction luminosity ( @xmath34 ) for such a system can be estimated using equation ( 18 ) from @xcite where @xmath34 is on the order of ( 23)@xmath29 for both systems assuming an asteroid belt at @xmath110 au with a width of @xmath11 au and consisted of @xmath110 km ( diameter ) planetesimals in collisional cascades .",

    "the disk seds of these four systems are shown together in figure [ amazing4 ] for easy comparison .",
    "as discussed in section [ asteroid - analog ] , the dust observed in the warm components for both vega and fomalhaut is consistent with being generated in a steady - state collisional cascade in a planetesimal belt .",
    "a similar conclusion obtains for the other two systems . for hr 8799",
    ", the warm dust component has a temperature @xmath1150 k and fractional luminosity @xmath36 ( @xcite ) ; the latter is much less than the maximum fractional luminosity for steady state collisional dust production , @xmath37 , estimated for a belt at 8 au at hr 8799 s age of @xmath130 myr . for the @xmath2 eri system ,",
    "the warm component has @xmath38 and temperature of @xmath1150 k ( @xcite ) ; the latter is compatible with @xmath39 for a belt at 3 au at an age of @xmath1800 myr .",
    "based on the similarity of the observed seds and resolved disk structures , it is very likely that the warm components in these four systems originate in well - separated planetesimal belts ( remnants of planet formation ) , resembling the configuration of our own solar system which has two left - over planetesimal belts : an asteroid belt near the water - frost line , between mars and jupiter , with a characteristic temperature of @xmath1170150 k , and a kuiper belt at @xmath13055 au with dust emission peaked at @xmath150 k.    there are two aspects of the two - belt systems that must be explained .",
    "the first one is related to how these two separate belts were created , and the other one addresses how the system maintains such a large gap without dust filling in it .",
    "mechanisms to explain both the formation and evolution of the two belt systems are required to fully account for the observed pattern .",
    "planetesimal belts can be expected in regions where there was not enough material or not enough time to form a planet , because once formed , a planet would scatter or accrete the surrounding planetesimals .",
    "therefore , the stable locations of left - over planetesimals are governed by where the giant planets form and their migration history , which may include strong dynamical instabilities .",
    "consequently , the location of the observed dust is not expected to show much order among systems since it greatly depends on the numbers and positions of the giant planets and their migration history .",
    "in addition , it is an observational fact that higher mass stars harbor a more massive protoplanetary disk @xcite , and more giant planets @xcite .",
    "generally , one does not expect to find similarity in planetary configurations between low - mass ( i.e. , low luminosity ) and high - mass ( i.e. , high luminosity ) stars .",
    "[ amazing4 ]    among the four systems shown in figure [ amazing4 ] , only @xmath2 eri is a solar - like star and the rest are early - type stars .",
    "the luminosity ( the dust heating power ) difference ranges roughly two orders of magnitude among them , and yet the characteristic dust temperatures of the warm and cold belts are very similar .",
    "it is interesting to note that many unresolved systems also have a similar two - belt configuration in the dust distribution based on their temperatures derived from unresolved excess emission @xcite .",
    "the fact that the temperature of the warm belts peaks at similar temperatures ( @xmath1170190 k ) between early - type and solar - like systems @xcite , however , suggests temperature - sensitive mechanisms play a major role in determining planetesimal configuration in the warm belts .",
    "giant planets are expected to form right outside the water - frost line where the amount of solid material and dynamical timescales favor the formation process @xcite .",
    "the young hr 8799 system has four giant planets @xcite separating the inner and outer dust belts @xcite .",
    "these four planets are very massive ( @xmath1710 @xmath40 ) so that they dominate the dynamics in the hr 8799 system .",
    "dust particles spiraling inwards from the cold belt under p - r drag are likely to be dynamically scattered and ejected by one of the planets before they reach the inner region .",
    "thus , the warm component in the hr 8799 system is unlikely to arise from grains generated in the cold planetesimal belt .",
    "comets , on plunging orbits originating from the cold belt could possibly cross over and then break - up or sublimate to deliver dust interior to the giant planets .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the inward flux of cometary bodies inside the orbits of the giant planets without detailed numerical simulations such as the one done by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the comet delivery scenario proposed by @xcite might work for our solar system at its current age , it is not clear that this scenario is directly applicable for younger systems ( such as the ones we discussed here ) where in - situ dust generation in the younger , more massive planetesimal belts is expected to dominate .    in the remaining three systems , fomalhaut is the only other one that harbors a directly detected planet , fomalhaut b @xcite .",
    "although the reality of fomalhaut b has been questioned because the spectrophotometry of fomalhaut b can not be reconciled with models for thermal emission from a young giant planet , a problem originally acknowledged in @xcite and further demonstrated by _ spitzer _",

    "was identified by @xcite and @xcite ; although the discovery of the inner warm dust belt ( @xmath13 au ) casts doubt on the existence of a high eccentricity planet @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent analysis of all available rv data of @xmath2 eri by @xcite found a significantly different orbital solution and suggested that the long - term rv variability is likely due to stellar activity cycles rather than a putative planet .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath2 eri b , if it exists just outside the warm belt , is a candidate to shepherd the warm dust belt @xcite .",
    "although the exact locations of the warm components in these disks are unknown ( unresolved ) , the orbital ratios ( @xmath46 ) between the outer cold belt ( mostly resolved in the submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths ) and the warm belt estimated from the dust temperature are roughly @xmath510 in all four systems,14 au and @xmath47110 au ; fomalhaut : @xmath4810 au and @xmath47140 au ; hr 8799 : @xmath4810 au and @xmath47100 au ; @xmath2 eri : @xmath483 au and @xmath4735 au . ] similar to the ratio in our own solar system ( the asteroid belt at @xmath13 au and the kuiper belt at @xmath135 au ) .",
    "a significant deficit of large grains ( best tracers for the unseen parent bodies ) in the region between the belts are evident due to the fact that high - resolution submillimeter observations do not detect such a filled - in component @xcite , although small grains can drift inward from the cold belt @xcite .",
    "the zone between the warm and cold belts that is mostly free of dust is very large .",
    "if the observed dust is being generated in both belts through collisional cascades of large parent bodies , we need a cleaning mechanism to maintain such a large dust - free zone .",
    "[ chaotic ]    the large gap between the warm and cold belts may be maintained by one or multiple planet - mass objects in the gap .",
    "if these planets have dynamical influence over the entire gap , they are likely to scatter any material that is either generated in the gap or drifts into it .",
    "the dynamical influence of a planet is given approximately by the extent of the overlap of first - order resonances which creates an unstable `` chaotic zone '' in the vicinity of a planetary perturber ( @xcite ) .",
    "applying this criterion , we find that in the vega system , the large gap could be maintained by a single hypothetical object with mass of a few 100 @xmath40 ( i.e. , a star / brown dwarf ) in a circular orbit ; for fomalhaut , a similar mass estimate of a few 100 @xmath40 obtains for a single hypothetical object in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath49 , based on the observed eccentricity of its cold dust ring ) .",
    "one can also imagine a lower mass perturber in very eccentric orbit being responsible for maintaining such a large gap ; the required eccentricity can be estimated by assuming that its pericenter and apocenter are near the locations of the warm and cold belts .",
    "we find that a large eccentricity ( @xmath500.8 ) is required , implying an object with a mass of @xmath150 @xmath40 in both cases .",
    "our simple estimates show that the gaps in both vega and fomalhaut are too large to be explained by a single circular / eccentric perturber , without contradicting the current upper limits of a few @xmath40 based on non - detections of planetary companions in the gaps .",
    "the minimum number of planets residing between the two belts is two  one inner planet outside the warm dust belt to shepherd the inner planetesimal belt , and one outer planet interior to the cold dust belt to scatter large grains that drift inwards from the cold belt .",
    "we can then estimate the mass of two equal - mass planets in this case .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ chaotic ] where we plot the orbital distances of the two equal - mass planets and their associated chaotic zone widths as a function of the mass ratio between the planet and the host star . in the case of vega ( @xmath51 and we assume @xmath52 for the hypothetical planets ) , we find that two @xmath140 @xmath40 planets are needed to maintain the dust free zone . in the case of fomalhaut ( @xmath53 and we assume @xmath49 for the hypothetical planets ) , we find that two @xmath163 @xmath40 planets are needed .",
    "although these masses are likely overestimates because the single - planet chaotic zone formulae do not account for the strong secular perturbations that can extend the unstable zones in multiple planet systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is evident that just two planets in low eccentricity orbits having mass @xmath54 are inadequate for explaining the gaps .",
    "our simplified approach , in estimating the masses for single planetary perturbers and for two equal - mass perturbers for explaining the large gaps in vega and fomalhaut , gives limits that are more than an order of magnitude higher than the @xmath1few @xmath40 planet mass limits for these systems based on non - detections of planetary companions in the gaps .",
    "it is , therefore , probable that multiple , lower mass planets are responsible for clearing the gaps .",
    "we can estimate the numbers and orbital radii of multiple , jupiter - mass planets that would clear this region , by assuming that they are separated such that their chaotic zones just fill the regions between them .",
    "we find that four or five @xmath55 mass planets are required for the large gap in vega and in fomalhaut .",
    "( this is reminiscent of the hr 8799 system in which four planets separate the two dust belts . )",

    "the radiation blow - out time scale at 0.1 au is on the order of a year , suggesting a very high dust replenishing rate .",
    "this high replenishing rate implies that this phenomenon is unlikely to be in a static state .",

    "@xcite present an analytical model to form a narrow ring due to sublimation of dust grains drifting radially inward due to p - r drag .",
    "this scenario could work in vega and fomalhaut if the dust drifting inward is refractory ; i.e. , the asteroid belt discussed in this paper being the source of the particles .",

    "the replenishing rate implies that a total mass of @xmath30 0.4 @xmath41 in the vega asteroid belt is required to retain such a rate over the age of the system ( @xmath1400 myr ) .",
    "however , the range of distances and particle sizes from this drag - in component would result a much higher excess flux in the mid - ir ( see figure 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , one would expect that the amount of hot dust should be proportional to the amount of dust in the source region , i.e. , the asteroid belt .",
    "the fact that the hot dust in both systems has a similar fractional luminosity , 5@xmath59 @xcite while the warm dust in the fomalhaut system is @xmath13 times more than that of the vega system , argues against this non - stochastic , transport hypothesis",
    ".    there may be an alternative direction for models of the hot dust component .",
    "the basic requirements are ( 1 ) a mechanism that prevents the radiation - pressure blow - out of very small dust grains at very small astrocentric distances ( @xmath110 stellar radii , i.e. , the @xmath11500 k dust that is creating the @xmath12-band excess ) ; ( 2 ) a grain composition that yields a featureless , roughly rayleigh - jeans ( or steeper than rayleigh jeans ) spectrum between 2 and 10 @xmath0  ( for consistency with the sed constraints in section [ stellar ] ) ; and ( 3 ) a mechanism for the generation grains of the appropriate composition .",
    "although a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , these requirements evoke the behavior of nano dust grains ( sizes of ten to a few tens of nm ) that are charged by the solar wind and trapped by the solar magnetic field near the sun .",
    "the underlying hypothesis is that sungrazing planetesimals deliver silicate - rich grains to the stellar neighborhood , but when the silicates break down they yield metal oxides @xcite .",

    "[ vegahotexcessmodel ]    the resulting nano grains are very refractory , for example , mgo has a melting temperature of 3100 k and boiling temperature of 3873 k , nearly as high as the sublimation temperature of carbon , 3900 k ; feo boils at 3687 k. consequently , mgo , feo , and composite grains of the same elements can survive close to the star .",
    "we use the hot excess around vega as an example to illustrate the resultant sed since the location for such a hot excess is best constrained among all the @xmath12band excess sources .",
    "we adopted the optical constants for a mixed iron / magnesium oxide , @xmath62 @xcite and computed their absorption and scattering efficiencies using mie theory .",
    "we computed a model sed ( figure [ vegahotexcessmodel ] ) for such a narrow ring between 0.18 and 0.2 au from the star , and composed of grains with radii of 520 nm ( 0.0050.02 @xmath0 ) in a size - distribution power index of @xmath203.5 using the stellar model computed by @xcite ( for dust viewed from the stellar equator ) .",
    "the dust temperatures for these gains in the region of 0.180.2 au from vega reach @xmath12400 k. with the grain density of 4.8 g @xmath63 , a total mass of 2.3@xmath710@xmath64 produces the 1.29% excess of the star at 2.2 @xmath0 . toward longer wavelengths to 10 @xmath0 ,",
    "the output falls roughly as @xmath65 , where rayleigh jeans falls as @xmath66 , that is the spectrum is somewhat steeper than rayleigh - jeans ( see figure [ vegahotexcessmodel ] ) .",
    "there is a prominent feature at @xmath118 @xmath0  in our model sed due to the crystalline form of the material used to determine the optical constants , which might not represent the actual form of material resulted from sublimation of silicate - rich planetesimals .",
    "the mass in nano dust is equivalent to about 60 halley comet nuclei .",
    "although the conversion of a comet nucleus to nano dust will not be fully efficient , it should be reasonably high since the process involves erosion of large grains and so most of the solid material ( which is believed to constitute more than half the mass of a typical comet nucleus ) may be converted into oxides .",
    "thus , it appears that a plausible number of planetesimals ( perhaps no more than a couple of hundred ) would suffice to provide the nano grain population .",
    "finally , we would like to emphyasize that the model sed shown in figure [ vegahotexcessmodel ] is one example that satisfies the requirements ( as listed previously ) in our hypothesis .",
    "our proposed scenario does not depend on the exact nature of the material as long as they meet these requirements .",
    "we now consider the magnetic trapping of these dust grains .",
    "vega has a magnetic field strength of @xmath11.2 g , with about a quarter in a dipolar component and the rest in higher order terms @xcite .",
    "to first order , this is similar to that of the sun , with a surface field of about 1 g , dominated by a dipole but with complex components due to activity .",
    "nano grains in the vicinity of vega will acquire electric charge through the photoelectric effect .",
    "this process has been modeled by @xcite , who find that a 30 nm grain illuminated by an a0 star will reach a level of about 200 @xmath67 , or charge per mass ratio ( @xmath68 ) @xmath12 @xmath710@xmath69 .",
    "smaller grains will reach higher values of @xmath68 . assuming a field similar to that of the sun , these values are in the range where trapping occurs @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the hypothesis that the 2 @xmath0  excess is emitted by nano grains trapped in the magnetic field of vega does satisfy the three conditions listed above . a better understanding of the behavior of the magnetic field of the star is required to improve our understanding of whether it is indeed the process that accounts for this emission .",
    "furthermore , this magnetically trapped , nano dust model can apply to other stars that show @xmath12-band hot excesses through interferometry as long as these stars possess some magnetic field and can charge these nano particles through photoelectric effect ( for early - type star ) or stellar wind ( for late - type stars ) .",
    "nearby debris disks , including the debris disk twins : vega and fomalhaut , have been playing an important role in our understanding of the underlying planetary architectures ( planets , and minor bodies ) since their first discovery by _ iras _ through infrared excesses .",
    "much attention has been focused on their large , cold kuiper - belt - analog rings because they contain the majority of the left - over planetesimals and fine debris that covers a large surface area , making them readily detectable through infrared and submillimeter observations .",
    "the fomalhaut debris system possesses an unresolved warm excess first suggested by the _ spitzer _ resolved image at 24 @xmath0  @xcite . using the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum centered at this warm excess along with the photometry measured at the star position from the _ herschel _ 70 @xmath0  and alma 850 @xmath0  images",
    ", we corroborate that the warm ( @xmath1170 k ) excess arises from thermal dust emission , and is very unlikely to originate from stellar wind as suggested by @xcite . through resolved images at multiple wavelengths and mid - infrared spectrum , we identified for the first time the presence of a warm ( @xmath1170 k ) unresolved component in the vega debris disk , which is clearly separated from the cold belt .",
    "similar to the one in the fomalhaut system , we suggest that this warm component also arises from thermal dust emission from a planetesimal belt located near the water - frost line , analogous to the asteroid belt in our solar system .",
    "the warm belts in both systems share many similar characteristics .",
    "no extension at both mips 24 and pacs 70 @xmath0  ( angular radius @xmath273 ) and the observed dust temperature ( @xmath1170 k ) place this warm belt at @xmath12  from vega and @xmath115 from fomalhaut for blackbody - like grains .",
    "furthermore , the stringent constraints on the excess levels from 3 to 6 @xmath0  around both stars indicate that this warm belt is not spatially associated with the 2 @xmath0  ( @xmath12-band ) excesses inferred from the interferometric observations .    including the debris disks around @xmath2 eri and hr 8799 ,",
    "the four nearby debris systems all have spatially separated warm and cold belts where the observed dust temperatures for the warm belt are at @xmath1150170 k , whereas the cold belt temperatures are @xmath145 - 50 k despite the stark differences in stellar luminosity .",
    "similar bi - modal dust temperature structure is also found in other debris disk systems .",
    "systems where the location of the cold belts is known through resolved images either in scattered light or thermal infrared / submillimeter wavelengths and the association of a separate warm belt is inferred from spectrophotometric mid - infrared excesses include the following : hd 10647 , hd 15115 , hd 107146 , and hd 139664 ( although not all of them have the warm - belt temperature at @xmath1150 k ) .",
    "bi - modal temperature distributions inferred from sed analysis for many other unresolved sources @xcite argue that the debris disk structures are , somehow , determined by temperature - sensitive processes .",
    "it is well known that the location of the water - frost line in protoplanetary disks plays an important role in the formation of planetesimals . an asteroid belt located near",
    "the frost line for these warm belts seems to imply that they are inherited from the early evolution of planetary systems .",
    "the @xmath12-band excesses have been found around roughly a dozen of nearby main - sequence stars using ground - based interferometric techniques @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "sources like low - mass companions , ionized stellar wind or stellar scattered light have been ruled out except for hot ( @xmath11500 k ) dust emission being responsible for the excess emission .",
    "recent @xmath70-body simulations done by @xcite demonstrate the difficulty to scatter enough small bodies inward by a chain of planets inside a cold outer belt to sustain the observed level of small grains in vega and @xmath71 crovi . in the case of vega , the positive detections and constraints from non - detections using different interferometric facilities and wavelengths affirm the presence of very small grains in the very close vicinity ( @xmath180.2 au ) around the star .",
    "the properties of these hot dust are very different from what we know about the particles in our own zodiacal cloud ; instead , they are more likely to arise from the phenomenon observed near the sun where nano particles trapped in the magnetic field of the star . in our proposed scenario , nano - size metal oxides originate from the sublimation of silicate - rich planetesimals , and are charged either via the photoelectric effect or the stellar wind , and then magnetically trapped in close proximity to the star .",
    "the replenishing rate of these tiny particles can be very low once they got trapped .",
    "thus , our scenario does not require a massive reservoir of left - over planetesimals ; therefore , it presumably works for stars that show hot 2 @xmath0  excess but without detectable cold dust .",
    "although the warm belts in the four systems discussed in this paper are not directly resolved , unlike the cold belts , the orbital ratios between the outer cold and inner warm belts are roughly @xmath510 based on the observed dust temperatures .",
    "the large gap between the two planetesimal belts requires a mechanism to maintain it mostly free of dust .",
    "the most plausible explanation is the existence of planetary bodies in the gaps , analogous to the hr 8799 and our own solar system . from simple chaotic zone calculations and the mass limit on fomalhaut b",
    ", we argue that multiple low - mass ( @xmath271 @xmath40 ) planets are required to maintain such a large gap .",
    "a similar argument is also supported for the vega system , suggesting that the widely separated , two - belt debris systems are signposts for the presence of multiple low - mass planets .",
    "our results are in line with the recent result by @xcite where a positive correlation is identified between the debris disk detection rate and the presence of exoplanets with mass less than saturn around 60 nearby g - type stars , and echo the recent rv and _ kepler _ results @xcite that low - mass planets are more common than the massive ones , and that multiple planet systems are rather common among exoplanetary systems .",
