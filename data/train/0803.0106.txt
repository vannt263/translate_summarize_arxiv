    "experimentally , a low - mass enhancement in @xmath11 radiative decays @xmath12 at @xmath13 gev with a clear pseudoscalar assignment was first reported by the dm2 collaboration@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the dm2 collaboration@xcite and the mark iii collaboration@xcite gave the evidence of a resonant @xmath14 production around @xmath15 gev , preferably pseudoscalar , also in @xmath16 .",
    "a fit to the @xmath14 invariant - mass spectrum gave a mass of @xmath17 mev and a width of @xmath18 mev@xcite .",
    "an angular analysis of the @xmath14 signal found it to be consistent with a @xmath19 [ @xmath20 $ ] assignment .",
    "the nature of the @xmath8 is unclear .",
    "possibilities of the nature of the @xmath8 include the second and third radial excitations of the pseudoscalar meson @xmath21 , hybrid , glueball or multiquark state .",
    "however , the large uncertainty of the width of the @xmath8 leads to that the theoretical interpretations perhaps remain open .",
    "recently , based on the @xmath22 @xmath11 events collected in the besii detector , the radiative decay @xmath10 was analyzed by the bes collaboration , and a near - threshold enhancement was found in the @xmath14 invariant mass distribution at @xmath4 gev with a statistical significance larger than @xmath23 .",
    "a partial wave analysis shows that this structure is dominated by a @xmath19 [ @xmath8 ] with a mass of @xmath9 gev and a width of @xmath25 gev , and the production branching fraction is @xmath26@xcite .",
    "the improved measurements of the @xmath8 performed by the bes collaboration maybe open a window for revealing the nature of the @xmath8 .",
    "it is very important to exhaust possible conventional @xmath27 description of the @xmath8 before resorting to more exotic interpretations such as hybrid , glueball or multiquark state as mentioned above . in the present work ,",
    "we shall focus on the possibility of the @xmath8 being the ordinary pseudoscalar @xmath27 state . from pdg2006@xcite , the @xmath28 meson nonet ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath21 and @xmath31 ) as well as the @xmath32 members [ @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been well established . in our previous work@xcite , we suggested that the @xmath36 and @xmath37 , together with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 observed by the bes collaboration@xcite , constitute the @xmath1 meson nonet .",
    "theoretically , both the second@xcite and third@xcite radial excitations of the @xmath21 are predicted to lie in the mass range of the @xmath8 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to evaluate the widths of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 states in the @xmath0 meson decay model , and then check which of these two pictures can reasonably account for the total width of the @xmath8 .",

    "the main assumption of the @xmath0 decay model is that strong decays take place via the creation of a @xmath0 quark - antiquark pair from the vacuum . the new produced quark - antiquark pair , together with the @xmath27 within the initial meson regroups into two outgoing mesons in all possible quark rearrangement ways , which corresponds to the two decay diagrams as shown in fig.1 for the meson decay process @xmath40 .    the transition operator @xmath41 of the decay @xmath42 in the @xmath0 model is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a dimensionless parameter representing the probability of the quark - antiquark pair @xmath45 with @xmath46 creation from the vacuum , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the momenta of the created quark @xmath49 and antiquark @xmath50 , respectively .",
