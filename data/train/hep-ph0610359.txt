    "over the past few years it has become evident that a promising approach towards reconciling the apparent mismatch of the fundamental scales of particle physics and gravity is to modify the short distance behavior of gravity at scales much larger than the planck length , @xmath4 .",
    "the key premise of such an approach entails that the weakness of gravity is indeed evidence of extra spatial compactified dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this is possible because standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to a 4-dimensional world ( corresponding to our apparent universe ) and only gravity spills into the higher dimensional spacetime bulk , without conflicting with experimental bounds  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if this new approach is correct , gravity is not intrinsically weak , but of course appears weak at relatively large distances of common experience because its effects are diluted by propagation in the extra dimensions .",
    "the distance at which the gravitational and electromagnetic forces might have equal strength is unknown , but a particularly interesting possibility is that it is roughly at @xmath5 , the distance at which electromagnetic and weak forces are known to unify to form the electroweak force .",
    "this would imply a fundamental d - dimensional planck mass , @xmath6  tev , considerably smaller than the macroscopic 4-dimensional value , @xmath7 .    if nature gracefully picked a sufficiently low - scale gravity , the first evidence for it would likely be the observation of microscopic black holes ( bhs ) produced in particle collisions  @xcite . according to thorne s hoop conjecture , a bh forms in a two - particle collision when and only when the impact parameter is smaller than the radius of a schwarzschild bh of mass equal to the total center - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "subsequent to formation a tev - scale bh will promptly decay via thermal hawking radiation  @xcite ( for @xmath8  tev , the lifetime of a bh of mass 10 tev is less than @xmath9 s ) into observable quanta  @xcite . although the bh production cross section , @xmath10 , is about 5 orders of magnitude smaller than qcd cross sections , @xmath11 in two well - known papers  @xcite it was proposed that such bhs could be produced copiously at the lhc , and that these spectacular events could be easily filtered out of the qcd background .",
    "this is possible by triggering on bh events with prompt charged leptons and photons , each carrying hundreds of gev of energy .",
    "cosmic ray collisions , with center - of - mass energies ranging up to @xmath12  gev , certainly produce bhs if the lhc does .",
    "the question is , can they be detected ?",
    "most cosmic rays are protons , which generally collide with hadrons in the upper atmosphere , producing cascading showers which eventually reach the earth s surface . at energies of interest , however , the cosmic ray luminosity , @xmath13  @xmath14 s@xmath15 is about 50 orders of magnitude smaller than the lhc luminosity , thus making it futile to hunt for bhs in baryonic cosmic rays . on the other hand , neutrino interaction lengths are still far larger than the earth s atmospheric depth , although they would be greatly reduced by the cross section for bh production  @xcite .",
    "cosmic neutrinos therefore would produce bhs with roughly equal probability at any point in the atmosphere . as a result",
    ", the light descendants of the bh may initiate low - altitude , quasi - horizontal showers at rates significantly higher than sm predictions  @xcite . because of these considerations the atmosphere provides a buffer against contamination by mismeasured baryons , for which the electromagnetic channel is filtered out .",
    "neutrinos that traverse the atmosphere unscathed can produce bhs through interactions in the antarctic ice - cap and be detected by the icecube neutrino telescope  @xcite .",
    "this telescope , which is currently being deployed near the amundsen - scott station , comprises a cubic - kilometer of ultra - clear ice about a mile below the south pole surface , instrumented with long strings of sensitive photon detectors which record light produced when neutrinos interact in the ice  @xcite .",
    "the in - ice array is complemented by icetop , a surface air shower detector consisting of a set of 160 frozen water tanks , which serves as a veto for atmospheric muon background . at the same time , the energy deposited by tagged muon bundles in air shower cores becomes an external source of energy calibration .",
    "altogether , the expected energy resolution of the experiment is about @xmath16 on a log@xmath17 scale .",
    "moreover , the energy reconstruction is optimized for neutrino energy @xmath18  gev , allowing sufficient precision ( @xmath19 on a log@xmath17 scale ) to separately assign the energy fraction for emergent muons in neutrino interactions .",
    "because of this , the inelasticity distribution of events becomes a unique tool for sm background rejection , providing powerful discrimination of resonant processes  @xcite . in this work",
    "we re - examine the prospects for discovering bh resonances at icecube , by tagging on `` soft '' ( relative to what one would expect from charged current sm processes ) muons escaping the electromagnetic shower bubble triggered by the bh explosion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ 2 ] we update the semi - classical bh production cross section considering a new estimate  @xcite of the energy radiated in gravitational waves by the multipole moments of the incoming shock waves .",
    "this is followed by a detailed discussion of hawking evaporation taking into account that cosmic neutrinos produce bhs with large momenta in the lab system .",
    "specifically , we derive the energy distribution of the planckian cloud which is boosted in the forward direction with a large lorentz factor .",
    "armed with this distribution , we estimate the average energy of the bh light descendants to be less than 20% the energy of the @xmath1-progenitor . the hawking",
    "radiated muons then provide a very clean signal with negligible sm background , as the production of `` soft '' leptons in charged current ( cc ) interactions occurs at a much smaller rate than bh production .",
    "our results for event rates and discovery reach are presented in sec .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this last section we also entertain the possibility of producing tev - scale near - extremal bhs in particle collisions .",
    "analytic and numerical studies have revealed that gravitational collapse takes place at sufficiently high energies and small impact parameters , as conjectured years ago by thorne  @xcite . in the case of 4-dimensional head - on collisions  @xcite , as well as those with non - zero impact parameter  @xcite , a horizon forms when and only when a mass is compacted into a hoop whose circumference in every direction is less than @xmath20 times its schwarzschild radius up to a factor of order 1 . in the d - dimensional scenario",
    "the schwarzschild radius still characterizes the maximum impact parameter for horizon formation  @xcite . in the course of collapse",
    ", a certain amount of energy is radiated in gravitational waves by the multipole moments of the incoming shock waves  @xcite , leaving a fraction @xmath21 available for hawking evaporation  @xcite . here , @xmath22 is a _ lower bound _ on the final mass of the bh and @xmath23 is the center - of - mass energy of the colliding particles , taken as partons .",
    "this ratio depends on the impact parameter of the collision , as well as on the dimensionality of space - time  @xcite .    of course , this work is purely in the framework of classical general relativity , which is valid only for sufficiently massive bhs , @xmath24 .",
    "for masses close to @xmath25 , gravity becomes strong and the classical description can no longer be trusted .",
    "hence , it is important to impose a lower cutoff on the mass of microscopic bhs for which the simple semiclassical arguments can reasonably be expected to hold . following  @xcite , we define @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the smallest bh mass for which we trust the semiclassical approximation .",
    "string theory provides a promising route for understanding the regime of strong quantum gravity and in particular for computing cross sections at energies close to the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ensuing discussion will be framed in the context of string theory . to be specific",
    "we will consider an embedding of a 10-dimensional low - energy scale gravity scenario within the context of so(32 ) type i superstring theory , where gauge and charged sm fields can be identified with open strings localized on a 3-brane and the gravitational sector consists of closed strings that propagate freely in the internal dimensions of the universe  @xcite .",
    "after compactification on @xmath28 down to four dimensions , @xmath29 is related to the string scale , @xmath30 , and the string coupling constant , @xmath31 , by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the compactification radius . within this framework ,",
    "the problem of avoiding fast baryon decay  @xcite or lepton flavor violation  @xcite is shifted to the examination of symmetries  @xcite in the underlying string theory which would suppress the appropriate non - renormalizable operators at low energies . nevertheless , it is important to stress that for @xmath34 the typical decay involves a large number of particles .",
    "therefore , though these symmetries constrain the decay of the bh , throughout this paper we ignore the constraints imposed by the few conservation laws and we assume that bhs decay with roughly equal probability into all sm particles . from now on we set @xmath35 .",
    "the inclusive production of bhs proceeds through different final states for different classical impact parameters @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "these final states are characterized by the fraction @xmath37 of the initial parton center - of - mass energy , @xmath38 , which is trapped within the horizon .",
    "here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the maximum impact parameter for collapse , where @xmath41^{1/7}\\ ] ] is the radius of a schwarzschild bh in @xmath42-dimensions  @xcite , and @xmath43 is a form factor .",
    "a bound on the inelasticity and the form factor can be obtained by studying the formation of an aparent horizon , which ( because of cosmic censorship  @xcite ) gurantees the formation of a bh event horizon  @xcite .",
    "such a study can be easily accomplished by modeling the incoming partons as two aichelburg - sexl  @xcite shock waves ( i.e , by boosting the schwarzschild solution to the speed of light at fixed energy ) . the scattering of partons is then simulated through the superposition of two shock waves coming from opposite directions , such that their union defines a closed trapped surface which provides a lower bound on @xmath44 and @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "this lower bound , however , depends on the slice used to determine the apparent horizon , and becomes larger if the apparent horizon is taken on the future light cone of the collision plane  @xcite .",
    "this is because it is possible that for a given impact parameter an apparent horizon is not yet formed on the so - called `` old slice '' , but arises by the time a later `` new slice '' is reached . in our calculations",
    "we consider the estimates of @xmath46 and @xmath43 in both the `` old ''  @xcite and `` new ''  @xcite slices .",
    "the @xmath46 dependance complicates the parton model calculation , since the production of a bh of mass @xmath44 requires that @xmath47 be @xmath48 , thus requiring the lower cutoff on parton momentum fraction to be a function of impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "because of the complexity of the final state , we assume that amplitude intereference effects can be ignored and we take the @xmath49 cross section as an impact parameter - weighted average over parton cross sections , with the lower parton fractional momentum cutoff determined by @xmath50 .",
    "this gives a lower bound @xmath51 $ ] on the parton momentum fraction @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath49 collision .",
    "all in all , the @xmath54 cross section reads  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 labels parton species , and the @xmath58 are parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the choice of the momentum transfer @xmath59 is governed by considering the time or distance scale probed by the interaction .",
    "roughly speaking , the formation of a well - defined horizon occurs when the colliding particles are at a distance @xmath60 apart .",
    "this has led to the advocacy of the choice @xmath61  @xcite , which has the advantage of a sensible limit at very high energies . however",
    ", the dual resonance picture of string theory  @xcite would suggest a choice @xmath62 .",
    "fortunately , as noted elsewhere  @xcite , the bh production cross section is largely insensitive to the details of the choice of @xmath59 . in what follows we use the cteq6d pdfs  @xcite with @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ sigmaf ] we show the bh production cross section for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "bhs produced in particle collisions have non - vanishing angular momenta determined by the impact parameter of the incoming partons .",
    "since @xmath36 is only non - zero along the brane directions , the angular momentum lies within the brane .",
    "moreover , the initial horizon is likely to be very asymmetric as only gravity spills into the compactified dimensions .",
    "therefore , the excited bh state carries additional hair corresponding to multipole moments for the distribution of gauge charges and energy momentum within the asymmetric configuration .",
    "the decay of an excited spinning bh state follows several stages . the initial configuration looses hair associated with multipole moments in a balding phase through emission of gravitational waves .",
    "in addition , gauge charges inherited from the initial state partons are discharged within this phase via schwinger emission .",
    "the subsequent spinning bh evaporates in a two - step process : a short spin - down phase in which angular momentum is shed  @xcite , followed by a long schwarzschild phase of semi - classical hawking radiation .    in the rest frame of the schwarzschild",
    "bh , both the average number  @xcite and the probability distribution of the number  @xcite of outgoing particles in each mode obey a thermal spectrum . in 10-dimensions ,",
    "the emission rate per degree of particle freedom @xmath57 of particles of spin @xmath66 with initial total energy between @xmath67 is found to be  @xcite @xmath68^{-1 } , \\label{rate}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the instantaneous hawking temperature , @xmath70}\\ ] ] is the volume of a unit @xmath71-sphere , @xmath72^{1/7}\\ ] ] is the instantaneous schwarzschild radius of mass @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the greybody absorption area due to the backscattering of part of the outgoing radiation of frequency @xmath75 into the bh ( a.k.a .",
    "the greybody factor )  @xcite . recall that sm fields live on a 3-brane ( @xmath76 ) , while gravitons inhabit the entire spacetime ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the prevalent energies of the decay quanta are of @xmath78 , resulting in s - wave dominance of the final state . indeed , as the total angular momentum number of the emitted field increases , @xmath74 rapidly gets suppressed  @xcite . in the low energy limit , @xmath79",
    "higher - order terms are suppressed by a factor of @xmath80 for fermions and by a factor of @xmath81 for gauge bosons . for an average particle energy @xmath82 of @xmath83 ,",
    "higher partial waves also get suppressed , although by a smaller factor .",
    "this strongly suggests that the bh is sensitive only to the radial coordinate and does not make use of the extra angular modes available in the internal space  @xcite .",
    "actually , a recent detailed analysis  @xcite has explicitly shown that the relative emission rate of sm particles and the 10-dimensional bulk graviton is roughly 92:5 .",
    "this implies that the power lost in the bulk is less than 15% of @xmath44 , largely favoring the dominance of visible decay .",
    "therefore , in what follows we assume the hawking evaporation process to be dominated by sm brane modes and we neglect graviton emission during the schwarzschild phase . with this in mind , the average total emission rate for particle species @xmath57 is , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of internal degrees of freedom of particle species @xmath57 , @xmath86 for bosons ( fermions ) , @xmath87^{-1 } .",

    ", we comment briefly on the bh rate of absorption .",
    "the upper limit on the cross section for the particle absorption is  @xcite @xmath95 and so the accretion rate of the bh mass becomes @xmath96 where @xmath97^{1/7}\\ ] ] is the effective bh radius for capturing particles  @xcite and @xmath98 is the nearby parton energy density .",
    "the net change of the bh mass is therefore @xmath99 now , using the greybody parameters given in table  [ t ] it is easily seen that @xmath100 the highest earthly value of energy density of partonic matter will be the one created at the lhc , @xmath101 this means that the bhs that could be produced at the south pole would evaporate much too quickly to swallow the partons nearby .",
    "contrary to collider experiments , these bhs are produced with large momentum in the lab system , and their decay products are swept forward with large lorentz factors .    to perform a lorentz transformation of the evaporating bh from its rest frame @xmath102 to the rest frame @xmath103 of the observer ( icecube ) , we make use of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath104 of the outgoing hawking radiation . in the rest frame of the bh , at a distance large with respect to the schwarzschild radius of eq .",
    "( [ schwarzins ] ) , the energy - momentum tensor of the outgoing particles with energies @xmath75 in the range @xmath105 and with directions lying in a solid angle @xmath106 is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) as the emission rate per degree of freedom @xmath57 of particles having energies @xmath75 in the range @xmath105 and spin @xmath66 . as noted earlier , we are working with @xmath109 . in spherical coordinates with the bh centered at the origin ,",
    "the 4-momentum is @xmath110 integrating the ( 0,0 ) component of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dt1 ] ) over all directions and energies , we see that @xmath111 is the rate at which the bh radiates energy per degree of freedom @xmath57 of a particle of spin @xmath66 .",
    "this requirement dictated the expression that we wrote in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dt1 ] )  @xcite .    explicitly , we have for @xmath112 in the bh s rest frame ( with @xmath113 and @xmath76 ) : @xmath114^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\sin \\theta \\,\\ , d\\theta\\,\\ , d\\phi\\,\\ , d\\omega \\,\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let the black hole move at speed @xmath115 in the @xmath116 direction relative to the rest frame @xmath103 of the observer , and take the axes of @xmath102 and @xmath103 to be parallel .",

    "similarly , we can write @xmath125 putting this into the grey body factor @xmath126 gives its dependence on the energy and direction of the emitted particle as measured in the observer s rest frame . figure  [ bs ] shows how particles tend to be emitted in the direction of motion of a moving black hole .",

    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t3 ]    the expected number of background events rises with decreasing the low - energy cutoff .",
    "for example , for @xmath127 and a beam luminosity at the aarghw level , @xmath128 to remain conservative , we adopt this energy range and require a @xmath2 excess for discovery .",

    "yields small thermal fluctuations in the emission process  @xcite .",
    "therefore , strong quantum gravity effects may be safely neglected in this `` energy regime , '' @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , gravitational effects due to brane back - reaction are expected to be insignificant for @xmath44 well beyond the brane tension , which is presumably on the order of @xmath132  @xcite . as noted in the previous section",
    ", string theory provides a more complete picture for @xmath44 close to @xmath133 in string theory , the ultimate fate of the bh is determined by the string @xmath134 bh correspondance principle : when the schwarzschild radius of the bh shrinks to the fundamental string length @xmath135 an adiabatic transition occurs to a massive superstring mode  @xcite .",
    "subsequent energy loss continues as thermal radiation at the unchanging hagedorn temperature  @xcite .",
    "the continuity of the cross section at the correspondance point , parametrically in both the energy and the string coupling , provides independent support for this picture  @xcite . in the perturbative string regime",
    ", however , the parton - parton cross section contains the chan paton factors which control the projection of the initial state onto the string spectrum . in general , this projection is not uniquely determined by the low - lying particle spectrum , yielding one or more arbitrary constants  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the parton - parton cross section derived in  @xcite from the virasoro - shapiro amplitude leads to an enhancement of the predicted bh cross section for @xmath136  @xcite .",
    "this makes it plausible to adopt the bh cross section as a lower bound of the real planckian cross section .",
    "however , it is important to stress that the proposed signal to search for bhs at icecube strongly depends on the large density of quantum mechanical states of bhs with @xmath130 , and consequently it is only valid in the semi - classical regime . the lhc signal ( hard photons and leptons in the collision rest frame ) , however , can be mantained under plausible hypotheses on the superstring decay modes . with this in mind , the lhc discovery reach for the quantum regime shown in fig .",
    "[ reach ] may be taken as a lower bound , derived on the assumption that the bh cross section provides a lower limit on the string cross section .",
    "in this work we have reviewed the possibility of searching for bhs using cosmic neutrino interactions in the antarctic ice .",
    "we have shown that the ability of icecube to accurately measure the inelasticity distribution of events provides a unique discriminator for sm background rejection  @xcite , allowing extremely sensitive probes of tev - scale bh production . in the optimistic case",
    "that the neutrino flux is at the wb level , icecube has a substantial discovery potential for bhs , well in the semi - classical regime where @xmath137 .",
    "the statistically significant @xmath2 excess extends up to @xmath138    a point worth noting at this juncture : in assessing the discovery potential of icecube we have performed a lorentz transformation of the evaporating bh from its rest frame to the lab frame , so as to obtain the boosted energy spectrum of the outgoing hawking radiation .",
    "such a spectrum is also relevant for the study of near - extremal supersymmetric bhs , which could be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "these bhs can be associated with the supermassive string modes expected to populate the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "note that in order to mantain the configuration of the initial state with `` zero supersymmetry , '' the central charge conservation would force these bhs to be pair produced with non - zero transverse momentum ( @xmath139 ) , travelling along the beam pipe .",
    "therefore , the prompt decay of the bhs would produce a startlingly clean signal that should have very few backgrounds : their decay products ( that of course may include sparticles  @xcite ) , would trigger high multiplicity fireworks with boosted spherical shape collimated into back - to - back pencil beams .",
    "a crude estimate of the event rates can be obtained from the analysis of `` @xmath140 '' subprocesses  @xcite .",
    "the results are encouraging : the production rate of bhs with large @xmath141 ( which is balanced by the momentum of an energetic parton ) would still be large enough for detection at lhc ( assuming an integrated luminosity 100  fb@xmath142 ) .",
    "of course the energy requirement for bh pair production would yield an additional suppression factor and its proper consideration requires a monte carlo simulation .",
    "therefore , we strongly recommend to include in future versions of the bh event generators charybdis  @xcite and catfish  @xcite a detailed treatment of production and evaporation of near - extremal supersymmetric bhs .    in closing ,",
    "it is important to stress that this analysis is meant to investigate the underlying principles and does not account for the details of the detector response . though the devil is generally in the details",
    ", we believe our estimate of the icecube discovery reach is conservative , as we have not included the @xmath143-channel which has the potential of nearly doubling our signal event background .",
    "specifically , @xmath143 leptons emitted by the bh may decay in flight inside the instrumented volume after escaping the electromagnetic shower bubble , thereby triggering a `` second bang  @xcite . ''",
    "the ratio of the first to second bang fractional energy provides a clean direct signal of bh production , and like the muon channel is `` independent '' of the absolute neutrino flux .",
    "the inclusion of the tau channel , however , requires a full blown monte carlo simulation to properly determine the acceptance for such events , in which the triggering probability for the second bang depends on @xmath144 and the corresponding tau decay length .    in summary , over the next few years",
    "high - statistics high - energy precision data will be collected at the lhc .",
    "in addition , the icecube neutrino telescope is coming on line with complementary information at ultra - high energies .",
    "this new arsenal of data will certainly provide an ideal testing ground for tev - scale bh production , and , at the same time , a unique opportunity to view similar physics from two different points of view .",
    "should the lhc find evidence of bhs a bit outside the range accessible for the baseline icecube design , the ideas discussed in this paper could constitute another compelling reason for pursuing hypercube  @xcite .",
