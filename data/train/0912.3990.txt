    "ultra - cold atom gases provide a unique opportunity to study basic models of strongly interacting many - body systems in a highly controlled experimental framework  @xcite . after the pioneering realization of the superfluid - to - mott insulator transition of ultra - cold bosonic atoms  @xcite ,",
    "recently different groups reported the realization of a mott - insulating state also for ultra - cold @xmath2k fermionic atoms on three - dimensional simple - cubic lattices  @xcite .",
    "a next major step would be the realization and identification of a low - temperature antiferromagnetically ordered nel state in such systems .",
    "in fact , various recent studies explored the prospects of realizing the antiferromagnetic nel state in an ultra - cold gas of fermionic atoms confined to an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "a quantity that is important in assessing the relevant temperature scale is the upper bound on the entropy allowed in order to transfer the atoms into the antiferromagnetically ordered state . for a three - dimensional fermionic hubbard model on a simple - cubic lattice at half - filling , estimates of the entropy @xmath3 as a function of temperature , as well as the ratio @xmath4 between the onsite repulsion @xmath5 and the hopping amplitude @xmath6 , were obtained within a single - site dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approach  @xcite . as reported in ref .",
    ", dmft however overestimates the nel temperature by about @xmath7 in the intermediate coupling regime , as compared to direct quantum monte carlo simulations based on systems with up to @xmath8 lattice sites  @xcite .",
    "obtaining in a similar way the entropy from direct quantum monte carlo simulations is challenging , and typically involves integration of the specific heat over an extended temperature range .",
    "however , in the limit of large @xmath4 , the spin physics of the hubbard model is well known to be described by a nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg model , with an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath9 , obtained within perturbation theory around the strong coupling limit @xmath10 .",
    "this model is accessible to large scale quantum monte carlo simulations and moreover  as shown below ",
    "it is possible to provide precise values of the entropy in this large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "in particular , one can obtain the value of the critical entropy density ( i.e. the entropy per lattice site ) @xmath11 , below which antiferromagnetic order emerges .",
    "nevertheless , thus far no systematic quantum monte carlo study concerning the entropy has been reported . on the other hand , different estimates of @xmath11 for the heisenberg antiferromagnet",
    "have been put forward recently . in ref .  , a schwinger boson approach  @xcite was employed , leading to the estimate that @xmath11 is about @xmath7 of the mean - field value @xmath12 .",
    "a more recent study  @xcite reported a value of @xmath11 obtained from a fluctuation - corrected mean - field approach , leading to a reduction in @xmath11 of only @xmath13 from the mean - field value @xmath14 .",
    "this rather large discrepancy among current estimates of @xmath11 calls for a clarification based on numerically exact simulations of the heisenberg model .",
    "( dashed lines ) and @xmath15 ( solid lines ) .",
    "error bars for the shown data are below the line thickness .",
    "vertical lines show the transition temperatures @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the antiferromagnet and the ferromagnet , respectively .",
    "green dashed - dotted curves denote fits to the algebraic low-@xmath18 scaling @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the antiferromagnet ( ferromagnet ) .",
    ", width=321 ]    here , we present an unbiased estimate of the temperature dependence of the entropy and in particular the critical entropy density by combining extended ensemble quantum monte carlo simulations with a finite - size scaling analysis based on the known critical properties of the quantum heisenberg model . for comparison , we consider in the following both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the three - dimensional simple - cubic lattice .",
    "these models are described by a hamiltonian @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a spin-1/2 degree of freedom on lattice site @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is nearest - neighbor exchange interaction , with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , for the antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) case . from previous studies , the locations of the transition temperatures to the ordered phases",
    "have been determined as @xmath27  @xcite ( nel temperature ) for the antiferromagnet , and @xmath28  @xcite ( curie temperature ) for the ferromagnet , based on quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "in order to extract the temperature dependence of the entropy , we use an optimized extended ensemble approach  @xcite , that is based on a generalization of the wang - landau  @xcite algorithm to the case of quantum monte carlo simulations  @xcite , performed within the stochastic series expansion representation  @xcite using multi - cluster deterministic loop updates  @xcite . within this approach ,",
    "one obtains monte carlo estimates of the expansion coefficients @xmath29 of the high - temperature series expansion of the partition function @xmath30 in the inverse temperature @xmath31 , @xmath32 for a given system of @xmath33 lattice sites . here , @xmath34 denotes the linear size of the simulated finite cube , and we employ periodic boundary conditions in all directions . from the expansion coefficients @xmath29 , the free energy @xmath35 the internal energy @xmath36 and the entropy @xmath37",
    "are obtained as continuous functions of the temperature @xmath18 . in practice , as discussed in ref .",
    ", we obtain the expansion coefficients up to a upper cutoff @xmath38 , that is chosen sufficiently large in order to reliably calculate the thermodynamic properties of the finite system based on the coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath39 down to a given temperature scale @xmath40 . the required @xmath38 scales linear in both @xmath40 and the system size @xmath41 . in our simulations , we consider finite systems up to @xmath42 , for which @xmath43 is required in order to obtain thermodynamic properties down to a temperature of about @xmath44 . repeated simulations with independent random streams results in statistical error bars on the thermodynamic quantities .     with the inverse linear system size @xmath45 for the spin-1/2 quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet and ferromagnet on the simple - cubic lattice .",
    "the quantum monte carlo data are shown by symbols , and the dashed lines represent fits of the finite - size data for @xmath46 to the finite - size scaling form in eq .",
    "the results for @xmath11 in the thermodynamic limit are indicated by symbols as well .",
    ", width=321 ]",
    "in fig .  1 , we present the results for the entropy from our simulations for both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic heisenberg model . for both cases ,",
    "we show data for systems with @xmath47 and @xmath15 . outside a narrow range around the transition temperature ,",
    "the entropy curves obtained for the two different system sizes compare well , and thus essentially represent the behavior of the entropy density in the thermodynamic limit . also shown in fig",
    ".  1 are fits of the numerical data to the low-@xmath18 scaling @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet , respectively .",
    "this difference in the low-@xmath18 scaling behavior relates to the linear ( quadratic ) dispersion of the magnetic spin - wave excitations in the antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) case  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to extract the critical entropy @xmath11 in the thermodynamic limit , we need to perform a finite - size scaling analysis of the finite - size data @xmath48 taken at the transition temperature . for this purpose",
    ", we use a finite - size scaling ansatz @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the critical exponent of the correlation length , and @xmath51 the dimensionality of the system . starting from @xmath52",
    ", this relation follows from the scaling behavior of the free energy @xmath53 with the correlation length @xmath54 , that scales as @xmath55 when the reduced temperature @xmath56 , by the usual finite - size scaling ansatz , that at criticality @xmath54 relates to the linear system size @xmath34 . for the current case of a three - dimensional system ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 symmetry , @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows that the finite - size data indeed fits well to the above scaling form in the range of system sizes @xmath46 . from the extrapolated values , we obtain @xmath60 for the antiferromagntic model , whereas for the ferromagnet , a larger value of @xmath61 results .",
    "we also performed an algebraic fit without biasing the exponent , which returned identical values of @xmath11 within the statistical error bars .    while the ferromagnet has a critical temperature @xmath17 that is about @xmath62 _ lower _ than @xmath16 , it orders already below an entropy that is about @xmath63 _ higher _ than the critical entropy of the antiferromagnet .",
    "the higher critical entropy directly exhibits a reduced efficiency of thermal disorder in destroying long - range magnetic order .",
    "the lower transition temperature of the ferromagnetic is due to a significantly enhanced production of entropy upon heating up the system , which follows from both fig .  1 , as well as from the mentioned difference in the low-@xmath18 behavior of the entropy .",
    "based on numerically exact quantum monte carlo simulations , we obtained the temperature dependence of the entropy for both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 heisenberg model on the simple - cubic lattice .",
    "focusing on the region close to the magnetic ordering transition , we employed a finite - size scaling analysis to extract the critical entropy density below which long - ranged magnetic order sets in . in case of the antiferromagnetic model , our result for the critical entropy is consistent with a @xmath7 reduction from the mean - field value , that was estimated recently from a schwinger boson calculation@xcite .",
    "this clarifies among the different values of the critical entropy reported previously@xcite . in comparison",
    ", we found the ferromagnet to be more robust to thermal disorder , which at criticality is about @xmath63 larger for the ferromagnet than for the antiferromagnet in terms of the critical entropy .",
    "we consider the current results for the temperature dependence of the magnetic entropy of value also for future calculations of the entropy for the full fermionic hubbard model beyond the strongly interacting regime .",
    "we thank n. blmer , a. muramatsu , and l. pollet for discussions , and acknowledge the allocation of cpu time on the hlrs stuttgart and nic jlich supercomputers .",
