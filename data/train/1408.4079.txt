    "in particular , the evolution of a fluid in a porous medium is important in the applied sciences and engineering ( see @xcite ) but also in mathematics ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the medium has important consequences and the usual equations for the conservation of momentum , _ i.e. _ the euler or navier - stokes equations , must be replaced with an empirical law : darcy s law @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath2 is the permeability of the porous medium , @xmath3 is the acceleration due to gravity , @xmath4 is the velocity of the fluid , @xmath5 is the density and @xmath6 is the pressure ( see @xcite ) . in our favourite units",
    ", we can assume @xmath7    a very important part of the theory of flow in porous media studies the coexistence of two immiscible fluids with different qualities in the same volume .",
    "the case of two immiscible and incompressible fluids is known as the muskat o muskat - leverett problem ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the density is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the interface between both phases .",
    "this interface is an unknown in the evolution . if @xmath10 , the system is in the so - called _ stable _ ( or rayleigh - taylor stable ) regime .",
    "given the depth of the porous medium , @xmath11 , we define the following dimensionless parameter ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath12    if the porous medium has infinite depth ( @xmath13 ) , the equation for the interface is @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes principal value .",

    "finally , we also mention that , using a computer assisted proof , the authors in @xcite proved that there exists curves , @xmath28 , solutions of of the confined muskat problem ( @xmath17 ) corresponding to the initial data @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 for a sufficiently small time @xmath31 ( _ i.e. _ the wave _ breaks _ ) .",

    "then , there exist @xmath31 , such that if @xmath137 the corresponding solution is global in time and the solution verifies @xmath138    the oddness assumption is related to the decay estimate .",
    "we know that the odd character of the initial data propagates , so the solution will have zero mean and then the equilibrium solution is @xmath139 .",

    "then , there exist @xmath31 , such that if @xmath145 there exists at least one global in time solution .",
    "this solution verifies @xmath146    the two main possibilities for finite time blow up seem to be    1 .   to reach the unstable regime , 2 .   a blow up of the curvature for the case @xmath105 .    to reach",
    "the unstable regime is similar to the _ turning _ singularities presents for and in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in particular we prove that , if the solution reaches the unstable case , the @xmath147 blows up first .",
    "the second source of singularity , a blow up of the curvature when the initial data reaches the boundaries may take two different forms : a corner - type singularity ( blow up of the second derivative while the first derivative is bounded ) and a cusp - type singularity ( blow up of the first and second derivatives ) .",
    "we prove that , if the second derivative blows up , then the norm @xmath148 blows up first .",
    "notice that , as a consequence of our proof , we get that if the initial data reaches the boundary , then the solution corresponding to this initial data reaches the boundary as long as it remains smooth .",
    "we collect these two results in the next proposition :    [ prop2 ] let @xmath149 be the initial data for equation and @xmath150 be an arbitrary parameter .",
    "we assume that the corresponding solution is @xmath151 .",

    "there are three main questions that remain open for this model : an existence theory for initial data in @xmath157 , a proof of finite time singularities where the curvature blows up and the existence of a geometry ( instead of a flat strip ) that enhances the similarities between the muskat problem and the model introduced in this paper .",
    "we obtain a new energy balance for .",

    "this energy balance fully exploits the diffusive character of the equation .",
    "notice also that , due to the positiveness of @xmath3 , we can not recover a smooth , periodic @xmath20 from this @xmath3 .",
    "now we define our notion of weak solution :    [ definition 1 ] @xmath162 is a global weak solution of if @xmath163,l^\\infty({\\mathbb t}))\\cap l^2([0,t],\\dot{h}^{0.5}({\\mathbb t}))\\ ] ] and holds in the sense of distributions : for any @xmath164 , periodic in space and with compact support in time , @xmath165 for every @xmath166 .",
