    "high power in a narrow frequency band ( spectral lines ) are common features of an interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detector s output .",
    "although continuous gravitational waves could show up as lines in the frequency domain , given the current sensitivity of gw detectors it is most likely that large spectral features are noise of terrestrial origin or statistical fluctuations .",
    "monochromatic signals of extraterrestrial origin are subject to a doppler modulation due to the detector s relative motion with respect to the extraterrestrial gw source , while those of terrestrial origin are not .",
    "matched filtering techniques to search for a monochromatic signal from a given direction in the sky demodulate the data based on the expected frequency modulation from a source in that particular direction .",
    "in general this demodulation procedure decreases the significance of a noise line and enhances that of a real signal .",
    "however , if the noise artifact is large enough , even after the demodulation it might still present itself as a statistically significant outlier , thus a candidate event .",
    "our idea to discriminate between an extraterrestrial signal and a noise line is based on the different effect that the demodulation procedure has on a real signal and on a spurious one .",
    "if the data actually contains a signal , the detection statistic presents a very particular pattern around the signal frequency which , in general , a random noise artifact does not .",
    "we propose here a chi - square test based on the shape of the detection statistic as a function of the signal frequency and demonstrate its safety and its efficiency .",
    "we use the @xmath0 detection statistic described in @xcite and adopt the same notation as @xcite . for applications of the @xmath0 statistic search on real data , see for example @xcite .",
    "we consider in this paper a continuous gw signal such as we would expect from an isolated non - axisymmetric rotating neutron star . following the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the parameters that describe such signal are its emission frequency @xmath3 , the position in the sky of the source @xmath4 , the amplitude of the signal @xmath5 , the inclination angle @xmath6 , the polarization angle @xmath7 and the initial phase of the signal @xmath8 .    in the absence of a signal @xmath9",
    "follows a @xmath10 distribution with four degrees of freedom ( which will be denoted by @xmath11 ) . in the presence of a signal @xmath12 follows a non - central @xmath11 distribution .    given a set of template parameters @xmath13 ,",
    "the detection statistic @xmath0 is the likelihood function maximized with respect to the parameters @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath0 is constructed by combining appropriately the complex amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 representing the complex matched filters for the two gw polarizations . and given the template parameters and the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 it is possible to derive the maximum likelihood values of @xmath17  let us refer to these as @xmath18 .",
    "it is thus possible for every value of the detection statistic to estimate the parameters of the signal that have most likely generated it .",
    "so , if we detect a large outlier in @xmath0 we can estimate the associated signal parameters : @xmath19 .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath20 the corresponding signal estimate .",
    "let @xmath21 be the original data set , and define a second data set @xmath22 if the outlier were actually due to a signal @xmath23 and if @xmath20 were a good approximation to @xmath23 , then @xmath24 constructed from @xmath25 would be @xmath11 distributed .",
    "since filters for different values of @xmath26 are not orthogonal , in the presence of a signal the detection statistic @xmath0 presents some structure also for values of search frequency that are not the actual signal frequency . for these other frequencies",
    "@xmath24 is also @xmath11 distributed if @xmath20 is a good approximation to @xmath23 .",
    "we thus construct the veto statistic @xmath27 by summing the values of @xmath28 over more frequencies .",
    "in particular we sum over all the neighbouring frequency bins that , within a certain frequency interval , are above a fixed significance threshold .",
    "we regard each such collection of frequencies as a single `` candidate event '' and assign to it the frequency of the bin that has the highest value of the detection statistic .",
    "the veto statistic is then : @xmath29    in reality , since our templates lie on a discrete grid , the parameters of a putative signal will not exactly match any templates parameters and the signal estimate @xmath20 will not be exactly correct . as a consequence @xmath25 will still contain a residual signal and @xmath30 will not exactly be @xmath11 distributed",
    ". the larger the signal , the larger the residual signal and the larger the expected value of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , our veto threshold @xmath31 will not be fixed but will depend on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we will find such @xmath0-dependent threshold for @xmath27 based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for any given value of the detection statistic can be expressed in terms of the detection statistic as @xmath32 , as per eq .",
    "( 79 ) of @xcite",
    ". therefore we will talk equivalently of an snr - dependent or @xmath0-dependent veto threshold .",
    "let us first examine the ideal case where the detector output consists of stationary random gaussian noise plus a systematic time series ( a noise line or a pulsar signal ) that produces a candidate in the detection statistic @xmath33 for some template sky position @xmath34 and at frequency @xmath26 .",
    "the question that we want to answer is : is the shape of @xmath33 around the frequency of the candidate consistent with what we would expect from a signal ?",
    "our basic observables are the four real inner products @xmath35 between the observed time series @xmath21 and the four filters @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 runs from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the inner product is defined by eq.(42 ) of @xcite .",
    "the four filters @xmath36 depend on the target frequency @xmath26 and the target sky location @xmath41 .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath42 that we would like to examine is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the detector noise and @xmath45 is the template , which in this case perfectly matches the signal . the parameters @xmath18 are the maximum likelihood estimators of @xmath46 derived from the data and the template parameters @xmath34 and @xmath26 .",
    "the definitions of the four coefficients @xmath47 are given in @xcite .",
    "given that the template parameters @xmath48 exactly match the parameters of the actual signal , then the waveform @xmath49 exactly matches the actual signal @xmath23 . in this case the four variables @xmath50 :    @xmath51    are four correlated random gaussian variables .",
    "the paper @xcite constructs the detection statistic @xmath0 from the data @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , we construct @xmath53 from the data @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is also centrally @xmath11 distributed in the presence of a signal and perfect signal - template match .",
    "we obtain the veto statistic by summing @xmath56 over the different frequencies of the event @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of the frequency bins in the event .",
    "if the value of @xmath27 is not consistent with a @xmath59 distribution , we reject the hypothesis @xmath42 .",
    "note that the degrees of freedom of the veto statistic is @xmath60 , as we use four data points to infer the four parameters @xmath61 .",
    "in the real analysis the signal parameters @xmath62 will not exactly match the values of one of our templates @xmath34 . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath18 will not match exactly the actual @xmath61 parameters and the frequency where the maximum of the detection statistic occurs , @xmath63 , will _ not _ be the actual frequency of the signal @xmath3 .",
    "however we can still set up a procedure to answer the question : is the shape of the @xmath0 statistic event consistent with what we would expect from a signal with parameters _ close to _ @xmath34 ?",
    "suppose that an event has been identified for a position template @xmath34 and for a value of the signal frequency @xmath63 .",
    "this is how the veto analysis would proceed :    1 .",
    "we determine @xmath18 and @xmath64 for each @xmath65 of the event .",
    "we generate a veto signal @xmath66 and compute the four variables @xmath67 3 .",
    "we construct the variables : + @xmath68 4 .",
    "( [ eq : nu ] ) we compute @xmath69 and then @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath70 is a good approximation to @xmath71 , then @xmath27 follows the @xmath59 distribution .",
    "as already outlined at the end of section [ s : summary ] , the veto statistic does not in general follow a @xmath59 distribution because in general the signal parameters do not exactly match the template parameters . due to this mismatch when step 3 is performed in the procedure described in the previous section ,",
    "not all the signal is removed from @xmath72 .",
    "consequently @xmath73 acquires a non - zero centrality parameter .",
    "since this scales as @xmath74 in the presence of a signal , the veto statistic threshold has to change with the snr of the candidate event in order to keep the false dismissal rate constant for a range of different signal strengths .",
    "we will thus adopt a snr - dependent veto threshold on our veto statistic @xmath27 .",
    "we will determine the threshold @xmath75 via monte - carlo simulations .",
    "an snr - dependent threshold in a similar context was first used by the tama group @xcite who performed snr-@xmath76 studies to veto out candidate events in their inspiral waves searches . see also @xcite for a detailed description of a @xmath10 time - frequency test . in a context of a resonant bar detector",
    "burst search , see @xcite .",
    "to determine the false dismissal rate , the false alarm rate and the threshold equation for the veto statistic , we have performed a set of monte carlo simulations on artificial and real noise .",
    "we have used 10 hours of fake gaussian stationary noise and of real science data from the ligo hanford 4 km interferometer .",
    "the results presented here are thus valid for a 10 hour observation time , which is the observation time of the all - sky , wide - band search that we plan to conduct on data from the second science run of the ligo detectors .",
    "we do not take into account spin down of pulsars .",
    "this may be justified for the short time length of the data . as it will be explained below",
    "we have injected both signals and spurious noise artifacts of the type that we observe in the detector output .",
    "the parameters of the gravitational waves signals which are injected into the noise are uniformly chosen at random in the following ranges : @xmath77 $ ] hz , @xmath78,\\sin\\delta_s\\in [ -1,1]$ ] , @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] . the strain @xmath82 or",
    "the amplitude of the model noise line is also randomly chosen in such a way that the resulting detection statistics value lie in the range : @xmath83 .",

    "we will thus not apply this veto technique to candidate events with @xmath85 . in this sense ,",
    "our method is designed to only discard large outliers .",

    "3 .   we search for the signal with template values @xmath34 in a small frequency range around @xmath3 .",
