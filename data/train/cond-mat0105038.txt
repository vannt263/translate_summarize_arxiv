    "the combination of an electronic interaction and a strong magnetic field in a two  dimensional electron system yields a rich variety of phases .",

    "resembles that of a fermi liquid in the absence of a magnetic field , or at small magnetic fields .",
    "this effect can be explained with a new sort of quasi - particles : at @xmath3 , each electron combines with two flux quanta of the magnetic field to form a composite fermion ; these composite fermions then move in an effective magnetic field which is zero on the average .",
    "the interpretation of many experiments supports this picture .",
    "we mention transport experiments with anti dots , in which features of the resistivity are related to closed loops of the composite fermions around the dots @xcite , and also focusing experiments @xcite .",
    "an overview over further experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "a field theoretical formulation of this composite fermion picture was first established by halperin , lee , and read ( hlr ) @xcite as well as kalmeyer and zhang @xcite .",
    "they formulated the hamiltonian in terms of chern  simons ( cs ) transformed electrons and studied within the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) many physical quantities . besides the theory of hlr there are other alternative formulations of the composite fermionic picture which are mainly based on a gauge transformation of the cs hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we used in @xcite the theory of hlr for a determination of the ground state energy of the @xmath4 system in rpa .",
    "there we found an infrared diverging landau energy .",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite by taking into account the correct normal ordering of the operators .",
    "we obtained a landau as well as a coulomb energy in rpa which is in satisfactory agreement with the exact and numerical results , respectively @xcite . in @xcite , conti and chakraborty ( cc ) improved the calculation of the coulomb energy by taking into account dynamical correlations through the formalism of singwi , tosi , land and sjlander @xcite ( stls ) , known as the singwi - sjlander theory and established first in the calculation of the structure factor of the coulomb theory .",
    "this method is a generalization of the rpa . in comparison to the rpa",
    "this method results in a coulomb energy which is a better approximation to the coulomb energy obtained earlier by numerical simulations of interacting electrons in the lowest landau level by morf and dambrumenil @xcite and by girlich @xcite .",
    "cc did not calculate the landau energy of the @xmath0 system which would also be a very interesting quantity to be compared with the rpa as well as the true result @xmath5 , the landau energy per electron .",
    "in their theory the resulting zero - frequency density - density response function vanishes as the square of the wave vector in the long wavelength limit .",
    "this is in contradiction to the rpa result where it vanishes linearly for the coulomb interaction @xcite . in their paper",
    ", cc mentioned that the behaviour of the zero - frequency response function of their theory is similar to the zero - frequency response functions of the alternative formulations of the cs theory @xcite cited above . but later on , halperin et al .",

    ", we will show that the quadratic behaviour of the zero - frequency response function in the theory of cc results from the decoupling of the equal time density - density and density - momentum correlation function . in cs - theories , this needs a careful treatment as will be shown by considering the heisenberg equation of motion for the longitudinal momentum operator . with the help of this equation",

    "it can be also learned from this procedure which relation in the decoupling approximations of density - density and density - momentum correlation functions in cs theories should be fulfilled . in the stls theory",
    "it is the heisenberg equation of motion of the wigner distribution function which is used to get the response functions of the system . in cs - theories",
    ", one has to decouple simultaneously a density - density correlation function as well as a density - momentum correlation function .",
    "we will show that the consistency relation for the decoupling of these two functions are not fulfilled in the theory of cc .",
    "this is the reason for the quadratic behaviour of the long wavelength zero - frequency density - density response function in their theory .",
    "we will suggest a stls type theory of the cs system , in which the decouplings respect the consistency condition . with the help of this decoupling , we will calculate the density - density response function , the compressibility , the dynamic structure factor , the static structure factor and the coulomb energy , as well as the landau energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we will introduce in section ii the cs - hamiltonian and calculate the heisenberg equation of motion for the longitudinal momentum",

    "since we want to study the adiabatic limit we neglect the time derivative in the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath38 we take the expectation value of this equation of motion with respect to the ground state of the system ( ground state for @xmath39 ) and get the following equation which is valid to linear order in @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 is the cumulant part of the expectation value @xmath43 where @xmath33 , @xmath44 are the operators @xmath45 or @xmath46 .    in the following",

    "we now discuss the leading terms in ( [ 70 ] ) .",
    "we begin with the third term of the right hand side of equation ( [ 70 ] ) and retransform it with the help of ( [ 10 ] ) from the cs fermions to the electrons ( cs retransformation ) . denoting the expectation value with respect to the electronic ground state by @xmath59",
    "we obtain @xmath60 @xmath61 is the electron current operator @xmath62 . here",

    "the cumulant expectation value of the second term of ( [ 90 ] ) is of order @xmath65 .",

    "the above results are rigorous consequences of the equation of motion in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "we consider this result as a consistency condition for an approximative calculation of the correlation functions : an approximative density - density correlation function and the corresponding density - momentum correlation function have to satisfy the above analysis .",

    "we add a remark concerning the hamiltonian ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 40 ] ) is truncated by keeping only terms up to second order in the quadratic density fluctuations .",
    "we can show by the same methods as above that an analysis of the full problem with the hamiltonian ( [ 20 ] ) leads to the same results .    in the next section",
    "we formulate a singwi - sjlander theory of the half - filled landau level , where we make an approximation of the momentum - density and density - density correlation function which respects the consistency condition ( [ 115 ] ) derived above .",
    "in this section , we will calculate response functions of the @xmath0 cs system which include correlations beyond the rpa . as mentioned earlier , one transforms the hamiltonian of electrons in a magnetic field to a cs - hamiltonian ( [ 40 ] ) at zero magnetic field .",

    "in the cs theory the hamiltonian ( [ 40 ] ) has in addition to the density - density vertex a density - momentum vertex .",

    "\\label{290 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the help of a numerical integration of ( [ 290 ] ) we get @xmath221 . the total landau energy per particle @xmath222 is then given by @xmath223 by doing a similar calculation for the total landau energy per particle within the rpa @xcite we get @xmath224 .",
    "the landau energy can be compared to the exact landau energy @xmath5 of the @xmath0 system .",
    "this is given by @xmath225 .",
    "thus we obtain that , in comparison with the rpa , the landau energy and the coulomb energy of the stls - type theories are in better agreement with the exact landau energy and the coulomb energy ( from numerical diagonalization ) .",
    "in this paper , we consider an approximation of the response function of the @xmath0 system which goes beyond the rpa .",
    "the method we used is the stls - theory , first established for the coulomb system @xcite .",
    "recently this theory was applied to the cs system by cc @xcite . in their theory , cc obtain a density - density response function which vanishes as the square of the wave vector in the long wavelength limit .",
    "we show in this paper that the zero - frequency density - density response function vanishes linearly in the long wavelength limit independent of any approximation .",
    "we obtain this result by considering the heisenberg equation of motion for the longitudinal momentum operator . from this equation of motion",
    ", we derive a consistency condition for a decoupling of the equal time density - density and density - momentum correlation functions .",
    "we show that this consistency condition is not fulfilled in the theory of cc and that is the reason for the quadratic behaviour of the zero - frequency long wavelength limit of the density - density response . based on the functional form of the heisenberg equation of motion of the wigner distribution function ( with external potentials ) , we suggest a decoupling of the correlation functions in this equation which respects the consistency condition .",
    "we solve the decoupled heisenberg equation of motion by numerical iterations and get the response functions of the theory .",
    "in contrast to the theory of cc , we obtain a density - density response function which vanishes linearly in the long wavelength limit for zero - frequency .",
    "we get agreement for the density - density response function with the theory of cc for momenta @xmath226 . for @xmath227",
    "we get agreement with the density - density response function of cc for frequencies @xmath228 and to the rpa for @xmath229 .",
    "further , we calculate the compressibility of the theory by using the compressibility sum rule . we obtain a coulomb correction to the compressibility not contained in the rpa . with the help of the response functions",
    ", we calculate the static structure factor , the excitation spectrum and the landau as well as the coulomb energies . as in the theory of cc",
    ", we get density excitations which are lower in their frequencies as a function of the wave vector than the excitations calculated with the help of the rpa .",
    "the obtained excitation spectrum is almost identical to the spectrum of cc .",
    "the same holds for the static structure factor .",
    "this is the reason for the agreement of the lowest landau level coulomb energy as well as the full coulomb energy with the energies calculated by cc . the lowest landau level coulomb energy fits better to the coulomb energy calculated by numerical methods @xcite ( @xmath230 of the numerical lowest landau level coulomb energy ) than the rpa .",
    "we remark that the relative part of the coulomb energy in the lowest landau level , i.e. linear in @xmath231 , is much enhanced as compared to the rpa .",
    "finally , we calculate the landau energy of the system . we obtain a much better approximation of the exact landau energy ( @xmath232 of the exact landau energy of the @xmath77 system ) than the rpa .    in summary",
    ", a consistent decoupling of the wigner function in the heisenberg equation of motion leads to results which are in a better agreement with known numerical and exact results , respectively , than the rpa .",
