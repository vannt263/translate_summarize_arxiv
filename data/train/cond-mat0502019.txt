    "<S> there are several interacting spin systems which have a gap in their spin excitation spectrum </S>",
    "<S> . the gap does not occur due to anisotropies present in the system but is quantum mechanical in origin . </S>",
    "<S> we give a brief overview on the different types of spin gap ( sg ) antiferromagnets , the models proposed to describe their physical properties and experimental realizations of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> our special focus is on exactly - solvable models and rigorous theories which provide the correct physical picture for the novel phenomena exhibited by sg systems .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : antiferromagnet , spin gap , exchange interaction , frustration , spin ladder , quantum phase transition    the last decade has witnessed an unprecedented research activity on undoped and doped quantum antiferromagnets ( afms ) in low dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> several new materials exhibiting a variety of novel phenomena have been discovered . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental effort is closely linked with theoretical ideas . </S>",
    "<S> the field of low - dimensional quantum magnetism provides a fertile ground for rigorous theory . </S>",
    "<S> powerful techniques like the bethe ansatz ( ba)@xmath0 and bosonization are available to study ground and excited state properties . </S>",
    "<S> models of interacting spin systems are known for which the ground state and in some cases the low - lying excitation spectrum are known exactly . </S>",
    "<S> theorems , furthermore , offer important insight on the nature of ground and excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge gained provides the impetus to look for real materials so that experimental confirmation of theoretical predictions can be made . in this review </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss a special class of low - dimensional afms , the so - called spin gap ( sg ) systems , to illustrate the rich interplay between theory and experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the review is not meant to be exhaustive but focuses on some broad classes of phenomena exhibited by sg systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the sg afms are characterised by a gap in the spin excitation spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the gap , @xmath1 , is measured as the difference between the energies of the lowest excited state and the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation spectrum of an afm is said to be gapless if @xmath2 in general , a gap appears in the spin excitation spectrum if some kind of anisotropy is present in the system . in sg afms , however , the gap is purely quantum mechanical in origin and can not be ascribed to any anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the basic spin - spin interactions in afms are described by the heisenberg hamiltonian    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the spin operator located at the lattice site @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the strength of the exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> real magnetic materials are three - dimensional ( 3d ) but behave effectively as low - dimensional systems if the dominant exchange interactions are intra - chain ( 1d ) or intra - planar ( 2d ) . for most materials , </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction is confined to only the nearest - neighbour ( n.n . ) spins on the lattice . also , @xmath6 s have the same magnitude @xmath7 for all the n.n . interactions . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , spin systems in which further - neighbour interactions can not be ignored and the exchange interaction strengths are inhomogeneous in character . in the next section , we discuss some possible origins of sg , the models proposed to describe such systems and experimental evidence for the different mechanisms of sg .      </S>",
    "<S> sg afms have spin - disordered ground states , i.e. , the spin - spin correlations in the ground state are short - ranged . the ground states , in the absence of long range magnetic order , can broadly be described as quantum spin liquids ( qsls ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin liquids are distinct from simple paramagnets , in certain cases one can define novel order parameters which have non - zero expectation values in the qsl states . </S>",
    "<S> formation of such states is favoured by quantum fluctuations the effect of which is prominent in low dimensions and for low values of the spin . in experiments , the presence of the gap @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is confirmed through measurement of quantities like the susceptibility , @xmath8 which goes to zero exponentially at low t as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> some well - known examples of sg afms are : spin - peierls ( sp ) systems , afm compounds consisting of weakly - coupled spin dimers , frustrated spin systems , spin ladders and haldane gap ( hg ) afms . </S>",
    "<S> the sp compounds are historically the first examples of magnetic systems exhibiting a sg . </S>",
    "<S> the sp transition was originally observed in some organic compounds . in 1993 , </S>",
    "<S> hase et al.@xmath10 obtained the first experimental evidence of the sp transition in an inorganic compound , @xmath11 the sp transition generally occurs in quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) afm spin systems with half - odd integer spins and is brought about by spin - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> below the sp transition temperature @xmath12 , a periodic deformation of the lattice sets in such that the distances between neighbouring spins are no longer uniform but alternate in magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an alternation , @xmath13and @xmath14 in the strengths of the n.n . exchange interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is dimerized in which singlet spin pairs occupy the links with enhanced exchange couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the sp ground state is spin disordered and a finite energy gap exists in the @xmath15 spin excitation spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> some afm compounds can be described as crystalline networks of spin dimers . </S>",
    "<S> well - known examples of such systems are the compounds @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in which a spin dimer arises from two antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath18ions@xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimer ground state is a spin singlet with total spin @xmath20 the excited triplet state with total spin @xmath15 is separated from the ground state by an energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation created on a particular dimer propagates through the network of dimers due to the weak inter - dimer exchange coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> * frustrated spin systems *    quantum fluctuations in a spin system are enhanced due to the presence of frustration in the system . </S>",
    "<S> frustration implies a conflict in minimising the exchange interaction energies associated with different spin pairs . </S>",
    "<S> such conflicts arise mainly due to lattice topology and the presence of competing further - neighbour interactions@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> afm systems with an odd number of bonds in the unit cell of the underlying lattice are frustrated spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> examples include the triangular , kagom , pyrochlore and fcc lattices . </S>",
    "<S> consider three ising spins located at the vertices of a triangular plaquette and interacting antiferromagnetically with each other . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of an interacting spin pair is minimised when the spins are antiparallel . </S>",
    "<S> the three interacting spin pairs can not , however , be simultaneously made antiparallel so that one pair is in the parallel spin configuraton in the lowest energy state . </S>",
    "<S> such conflicts are absent when the elementary plaquette of the lattice contains an even number of bonds as in the case of the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> determination of the ground state of the afm heisenberg exchange interaction hamiltonian ( eq.(1 ) ) on various lattices poses a formidable theoretical problem . the task becomes simpler if the spins are treated as classical vectors , i.e. , the magnitude of spins @xmath22 the energy of a triangle of spins is given by    @xmath23\\label{2}\\ ] ]    the ground state , i.e. , the minimal energy spin configurations are obtained for @xmath24 in the case of the full triangular lattice , the classical ground state has a three - sublattice order with each elementary plaquette of spins satisfying the constraint @xmath25 in the case of the kagom lattice , which is constructed out of triangular plaquettes , the classical ground state is infinitely degenerate@xmath26 . in the first case , quantum fluctuations do not fully destroy the order in the ground state but reduce the sublattice magnetization significantly from its classical value . </S>",
    "<S> recent calculations show that the @xmath27 heisenberg afm ( hafm ) hamiltonian on the triangular lattice has long range order ( lro ) in the ground state@xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> when the classical ground state is highly degenerate , i.e. , spin - disordered , thermal / quantum fluctuations may select a subset of states as ground states leading to new forms of spin order . </S>",

    "<S> another possibility is the opening up of a gap in the spin excitation spectrum . </S>",

    "<S> one might think that experimental observation of such qpts is not possible as exchange interaction strengths can not be changed at will . </S>",
    "<S> there is now reason to believe that exchange interaction strengths can be controlled . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations@xmath255 of the superfluid to mott insulator transition in a system of ultracold atoms defined in an optical lattice open up the exciting possibility of investigating phenomena associated with interacting many body systems in a controllable environment . </S>",
    "<S> the optical lattice is generated as a light - wave interference pattern using several criss - crossing laser beams . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice is equivalent to an energy landscape of mountains and valleys which can provide the confining potential to trap individual atoms in separate valleys . </S>",
    "<S> proposals for the implementation of spin hamiltonians in optical lattices have been put forward with the aim to study the exotic quantum phases of interacting spin systems@xmath256 the exchange interaction between spins belonging to atoms in neighbouring valleys can be modified by controlling the intensity , frequency and polarization of the trapping light . </S>",
    "<S> spin hamiltonians of interest can be engineered through the designing of appropriate optical lattice geometries . </S>",
    "<S> practical implementation of some of these ideas may be possible in the not too distant future . </S>",
    "<S> spin systems have recently been suggested as candidates for the realization of quantum computation and communication protocols@xmath257the spin systems considered so far include some sg afms like the mg and hg chains , the two - chain spin ladder etc.@xmath258 again , one anticipates intense research activity in the coming years on such problems . to sum up , </S>",
    "<S> the richness and vitality of the subject of sg afms are evident in the challenging problems of current research interest and also in the opening up of new avenues of research . </S>"
