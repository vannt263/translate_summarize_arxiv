    "the standard @xmath2cdm cosmological model provides a remarkably good fit to an array of precise measurements .",
    "however , there still remain some tensions between different measurements which must be resolved , and the physics responsible for the generation of primordial perturbations has yet to be delineated .",
    "this paper addresses both these issues .",
    "large - angle fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature ( @xmath3 ) are induced not only by density perturbations at the cmb surface of last scatter ( the sachs - wolfe effect ; sw ) , but also by the growth of density perturbations along the line of sight ( the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ; isw ) @xcite .",
    "although the cmb frequency spectrum is very close to a blackbody , there are small distortions , of the compton-@xmath0 type , induced by the rare scattering of cmb photons from hot electrons in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0 distortion has been mapped , as a function of position on the sky , by planck with an angular resolution of a fraction of a degree @xcite , and there are vigorous discussions of future missions , such as pixie @xcite and prism @xcite , that will map the @xmath0 distortion with far greater sensitivity and resolution .",
    "given that both the tsz and isw fluctuations are induced by density perturbations at relatively low redshifts , there should be some cross - correlation between the two @xcite , and the purpose of this paper is to calculate this cross - correlation .",
    "the motivation for this work is two - fold : first , there is some tension between the measured amplitude of @xmath0 fluctuations and the amplitude of density perturbations inferred from cmb measurements @xcite .",
    "the tension , though , is based upon theoretical models that connect the @xmath0-distortion and density - perturbation amplitudes .",
    "ingredients of these models include nonlinear evolution of primordial perturbations , gas dynamics , and feedback processes , all of which can become quite complicated .",
    "any empirical handle on this physics would therefore be useful . to quantify",
    "how well the cross - correlation can constrain these processes , we introduce a parameter , @xmath4 , which describes the peak redshift of the cross - correlation signal . if clusters were to develop a hot envelope earlier than currently expected from theory , @xmath4 would increase .",
    "we design this parameter so that it does not affect the tsz signal , merely the cross - correlation . using our formalism",
    "we quantify how well the cross - correlation breaks the degeneracy between structure formation parameters ( such as the amplitude of fluctuations , @xmath5 ) and the astrophysical processes which lead to the halo pressure profile .",
    "the second motivation involves the search for exotic early - universe physics .",
    "recent work has shown that primordial non - gaussianity may lead to a @xmath1 cross - correlation which may be used to probe scale - dependent non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "the present calculation will be used to explore whether this early - universe signal can be distinguished from late - time effects that induce a @xmath1 correlation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : calculation ] we derive expressions for the power spectra for the isw effect , the tsz effect , and their cross - correlation , and then present numerical results . in section [ sec : sz ] we evaluate the prospects to infer some information about the redshift distribution for tsz fluctuations from measurement of the tsz - isw cross - correlation . in section [ sec : ng ] we estimate the sensitivity of future measurements to the tsz - isw cross - correlation from primordial non - gaussianity . we conclude in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect describes the frequency shift of cmb photons as they traverse through time - evolving gravitational potentials .",
    "the fractional temperature fluctuation in a direction @xmath6 due to this frequency shift is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational potential at position @xmath9 and redshift @xmath10 , @xmath11 the conformal time , @xmath12 the speed of light , and @xmath13 the distance along the line of sight .",
    "the potential @xmath14 is related to the density perturbation through the poisson equation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a gradient with respect to physical position , @xmath17 newton s constant , and @xmath18 the matter density .",
    "we write @xmath19 $ ] in terms of the mean matter density @xmath20 and fractional density perturbation @xmath21 .",
    "we then use the friedmann equation to write @xmath22 in terms of the matter density @xmath23 ( in units of the critical density ) , hubble parameter @xmath24 , and scale factor @xmath25 .",
    "we further write the density perturbation @xmath26 in terms of the linear - theory growth factor @xmath27 .",
    "we can then re - write the poisson equation as @xmath28 , \\label{eqn : phik}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the gradient with respect to the comoving coordinates .    the power spectrum for isw - induced angular temperature fluctuations",
    "is then obtained using the limber approximation , which can be stated as follows : if we observe a two - dimensional projection , @xmath30 of a three - dimensional field @xmath31 , with line - of - sight - distance weight function @xmath32 , then the angular power spectrum , for multipole @xmath33 , of @xmath34 is @xmath35 ^ 2}{r^2 } p\\left(\\frac{l+1/2}{r}\\right ) , \\label{eqn : limber}\\ ] ] in terms of the three - dimensional power spectrum @xmath36 , for wavenumber @xmath37 , for @xmath31 .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : isw ] ) , ( [ eqn : phik ] ) , and ( [ eqn : limber ] ) , we find the power spectrum for isw - induced temperature fluctuations to be , @xmath38 ^ 2 p\\left(k       \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\           & = & \\left(\\frac{3 \\omega_m h_0 ^ 2}{c^3(l+1/2)^2 } \\right)^2       \\int   c\\,dz h(z ) \\left[r(z ) \\frac{d}{dz }       \\left ( \\frac{d(z)}{a(z ) } \\right ) \\right]^2 p\\left(k       \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\       & = &   \\int \\frac{c\\ , dz}{h(z ) } \\left [ \\delta^{\\rm       isw}_l(z)\\right]^2 p\\left(\\frac{l+1/2}{r}\\right ) , \\label{eqn : clisw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the matter - density power spectrum @xmath36 today . note that we used the relation @xmath39 to get from the first to the second line in eq .",

    "this upscattering induces a frequency - dependent shift in the cmb intensity in direction @xmath6 which we write as a brightness - temperature fluctuation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath0 distortion in direction @xmath6 , and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the frequency , @xmath45 the boltzmann constant , @xmath46 the planck constant , and @xmath47  k the cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "the compton-@xmath0 distortion is given by an integral , @xmath48 along the line of sight , where @xmath49 is the ( physical ) line - of - sight distance , @xmath50 the thomson cross section , @xmath51 the electron number density at position @xmath9 , and @xmath52 the electron temperature . the hot electrons that give rise to this distortion are assumed to be housed in galaxy clusters with a variety of masses @xmath53 and a variety of redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "the spatial abundance of clusters with masses between @xmath53 and @xmath54 at redshift @xmath10 is @xmath55 in terms of a mass function @xmath56 , a function of mass and redshift .",
    "galaxy clusters of mass @xmath53 at redshift @xmath10 are distributed spatially with a fractional number - density perturbation that is assumed to be @xmath57 in terms of a bias @xmath58 .",
    "the spatial fluctuations to the electron pressure @xmath59 that give rise to angular fluctuations in the compton-@xmath0 parameter induced by clusters of mass @xmath53 and redshift @xmath10 can then be modeled as @xmath58 times a convolution of the density perturbation @xmath31 with the electron - pressure profile of the cluster .",

    "being dominated by unphysical @xmath67 objects , we place a lower integration limit of @xmath68 , the redshift of the coma cluster .      given that the temperature fluctuation induced by the isw effect and the two - halo contribution to tsz fluctuations are both generated on large angular scales by the same fractional density perturbation @xmath31 , there should be a cross - correlation between the two .",
    "from the expressions , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : clisw ] ) and ( [ eqn : cly2h ] ) , it is clear that this cross - correlation is @xmath69      fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] shows the resulting power spectra . for our numerical results",
    ", we use a vacuum - energy density ( in units of critical ) @xmath70 , matter density @xmath71 , baryon density @xmath72 , a critical density for collapse of @xmath73 , and dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath74 , although the large - angle results that will be our primary focus are largely insensitive to these details . in practice",
    ", we find that over ninety percent of the contribution comes from the redshift range @xmath75 and the halo mass range @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we therefore integrate over slightly wider ranges ; @xmath78 and halo mass @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the large angle ( low-@xmath33 ) behaviors of the isw - isw autocorrelation , the @xmath1 cross - correlation , and the one- and two - halo contributions to the @xmath81 power spectra are easy to understand qualitatively .",
    "let us begin with the isw effect . here , the @xmath33 dependence of the transfer function is @xmath82 , and for large angles ( @xmath83 ) , the power spectrum is @xmath84 , assuming @xmath85 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "next consider the tsz power spectra .",
    "galaxy clusters subtend a broad distribution of angular sizes but are rarely wider than a degree .",
    "thus , for @xmath87 , they are effectively point sources .",
    "the fourier transform is thus effectively approximated by @xmath88 which is itself precisely the integral of the @xmath0-distortion over the cluster image on the sky , or equivalently , the total contribution of the cluster to the angle - averaged @xmath0 . as a result of the independence of @xmath89 on @xmath33 and @xmath84 for @xmath87 , we infer @xmath90 and @xmath91  const for @xmath83 . finally , the one - halo contribution to @xmath92 is nearly constant ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) for @xmath83 as expected for poisson fluctuations in what are ( at these angular scales ) effectively point sources .",
    "we now discuss the prospects to learn about the redshift distribution of the galaxy clusters that produce the compton-@xmath0 distortion .",
    "as seen above , the @xmath1 correlation is significant primarily at multipole moments @xmath94 , where the window function @xmath95 is largely independent of @xmath33 .",
    "the amplitude of the cross - correlation , relative to the auto - correlations , can be largely understood by examining the overlap between the redshift dependences of the two transfer functions @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "these transfer functions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltas ] .",
    "more precisely , we plot  noting that @xmath98 for the relevant angular scales@xmath99^{1/2}$ ] , the square root of the integrands for @xmath100 , as it is the overlap of these two functions that determines the strength of the cross - correlation relative to the auto - correlation .",
    "we also normalize the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas ] to both have the same area under the curve .",
    "given the current fairly precise constraints to dark - energy parameters , the predictions for @xmath97 has relatively small uncertainties .",
    "the prediction for @xmath96 depends , however , on the redshift distribution of the halo mass function , bias parameters , and cluster pressure profiles , all of which involve quite uncertain physics .",
    "measurement of the @xmath1 correlation will , however , provide an additional empirical constraint on the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 parameter .    to see how this might work , we replace @xmath101 , \\label{eqn : replacement}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 the functional form in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : replacement ] ) , is chosen so that , with @xmath103 given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : z0 ] ) , the auto - correlation power spectrum @xmath92 will remain unaltered for small @xmath4 .",
    "this alteration thus describes , for @xmath104 , a weighting of the compton-@xmath0 distribution to smaller redshifts ( and _ vice versa _ for @xmath105 ) in such a way that leaves the total @xmath0 signal unchanged .",
    "we now estimate the smallest value @xmath106 of @xmath4 that will be detectable with future measurements .",
    "this is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 fig .",
    "[ fig : clderiv ] shows @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "the planck satellite has now measured the tsz power spectrum and found good agreement with the expectations from the one - halo contribution to @xmath92 .",
    "they have now even presented good evidence for detection of the two - halo contribution at @xmath119 . from this",
    "we infer that the noise contribution @xmath120 to the @xmath81 measurement is already small compared with @xmath92 , and it will be negligible for future experiments like pixie or prism .",
    "we also note from the numerical results that @xmath121 is small compared with @xmath122this makes sense given that the cross - correlation of @xmath0 with the isw effect is small and further that the isw effect provides only a small contribution to large - angle temperature fluctuations .",
    "we may thus approximate @xmath123    the smallest detectable value of @xmath4 evaluates to @xmath124 , for @xmath125 .",
    "this is still a considerable uncertainty , but the signal to noise can be increased . while the majority of the cross - correlation signal is at low redshifts , the 1-halo tsz term , which appears as noise in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noise ] ) , peaks even more strongly at low redshift .",
    "thus the lowest - redshift bins are substantially noise dominated .",
    "assumes gaussian fluctuations for @xmath92 .",
    "this assumption is invalid at @xmath67 , where a single nearby large cluster can dominate large angular scales .",
    "the @xmath67 signal is already extremely small , however , so this does not change our conclusions . ] if we remove all information at redshifts @xmath126 , possible by explicitly detecting resolved clusters and masking them from the tsz map , then the noise can be considerably reduced . in this case ,",
    "the smallest detectable value becomes @xmath127 , which , if achieved , would provide some valuable information on the redshift distribution of tsz fluctuations , constraining the formation of massive clusters to the era of dark energy dominance .",
    "we also considered the profile of ref .",
    "@xcite , which produces a larger tsz signal and thus a larger cross - correlation .",
    "however , since the 1-halo tsz term dominates the noise , this actually slightly decreased the sensitivity .",
    "thus our results should be largely insensitive to the electron pressure profile used .",
    "we now review the @xmath1 cross - correlation from the scale - dependent primordial non - gaussianity scenario of ref .  @xcite .",
    "if primordial perturbations are non - gaussian , the amplitude of small - wavelength power can be modulated by long - wavelength fourier modes of the density field .",
    "the dissipation of primordial fourier modes with wavenumbers @xmath128 mpc@xmath129 ( which takes place at redshifts @xmath130 ) gives rise to primordial compton-@xmath0 distortions .",
    "if there is non - gaussianity , then the angular distribution of this @xmath0 distortion may be correlated with the large - scale density modes that give rise , through the sachs - wolfe effect , to large - angle fluctuations in the cmb temperature .    the predictions for this primordial @xmath1 correlation depend on the yet - unmeasured isotropic value @xmath131 of the compton-@xmath0 parameter for which we take as a canonical value @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath1 power spectra for the scenario are then , @xmath133 here , @xmath134 is the non - gaussianity parameter for squeezed bispectrum configurations in which the wavenumber of the long - wavelength mode is of the @xmath135gpc@xmath129 scales of modes that contribute to the isw effect , while the two short - wavelength modes have wavelengths @xmath136 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are no existing model - independent constraints on @xmath134 .",
    "we now estimate the detectability of the @xmath1 cross - correlation from non - gaussianity , discussed in ref .  @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the late - time contribution to @xmath92 and @xmath111 was neglected , and the detectability of the primordial signal inferred assuming that detection of @xmath0 fluctuations was noise - limited .",
    "here we re - do those estimates taking into account the late - time @xmath1 correlation calculated above .",
    "if the late - time @xmath1 is somehow known precisely , the signal - to - noise with which an early - universe @xmath1 signal with power spectrum @xmath137 can be distinguished from the null hypothesis is @xmath138 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noiseapprox ] ) and the numerical results for @xmath92 , we then obtain a signal - to - noise @xmath139 .",
    "this calculation differs from that of ref .",
    "@xcite in two respects ; we have included the late - time contribution to compton-@xmath0 fluctuations , which degrades the detectability @xmath134 by about a factor of 4 , even if the late - time @xmath1 correlation is assumed to be known precisely .",
    "the detectability is , moreover , limited by cosmic variance and not from measurement noise .",
    "we have included in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sn ] ) angular modes up to @xmath140 ; the signal - to - noise improves if the sum is extended to higher @xmath33 .",
    "this calculation overestimates the smallest detectable signal , as there is a theoretical uncertainty in the late - time @xmath1 correlation , as discussed in section [ sec : sz ] ; it must instead be determined from the data .",
    "there is thus an additional uncertainty to the inferred value of @xmath134 that will arise after marginalizing over the uncertain late - time @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "we thus assume that the total @xmath1 power spectrum is a combination @xmath141 of the late - time and non - gaussian contributions . here",
    "@xmath142 accounts for uncertainty in the amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "we then calculate the fisher matrix @xcite , @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the set of parameters to be determined from the data , and the partial derivatives are evaluated under the null hypothesis @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the noise with which @xmath147 can be determined , after marginalizing over @xmath148 , is then @xmath149^{1/2}$ ] and the signal - to - noise @xmath150 is @xmath134 divided by this quantity .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the marginalization over the isw - tsz effect only slightly decreases the detectability .",
    "since the noise is again dominated by the tsz 1-halo term , we can perform a similar cleaning to low - redshift sources to that used in section [ sec : sz ] .",
    "if we remove all @xmath152 clusters , we find that we can detect a smaller value of @xmath147 .",
    "numerically , using the fisher matrix as above to marginalise over uncertainty in the @xmath1 amplitude , we find @xmath153 , closer to the value estimated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we have calculated the tsz - isw cross - correlation , investigated its use in constraining the redshift distribution of @xmath0-parameter fluctuations , and evaluated the detectability of an early - universe @xmath1 cross - correlation .",
    "we showed that measurement of the @xmath1 cross - correlation can be used to constrain the redshift distribution of the sources of @xmath0-parameter fluctuations , as long as low - redshift tsz clusters can be masked , something that may be of utility given uncertainties in the cluster - physics and large - scale - structure ingredients ( pressure profiles , halo biases , mass functions ) that determine these fluctuations .",
    "we also showed that estimates , that neglect the @xmath1 correlations induced at late times , of the detectability of early - universe @xmath1 correlations may be optimistic by factors of a few .",
