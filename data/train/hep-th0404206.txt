    "for several years , the noncommutative space in string theory has been studied actively @xcite . at first ,",

    "many attempts to study this new noncommutativity have been made .",
    "for example , the solutions that represents noncommutative superspace were introduced in the context of super - lie matrix model @xcite . and",
    "many attempts have been also made in the context of field theory , quantum mechanics , string theory @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to shed the lights on this noncommutativity from the view point of the ikkt matrix model @xcite .    while one can investigate the ikkt matrix model by the expansion around the commutative ( diagonal ) background @xcite , it is also interesting to start with the following solution : @xmath0=-i c^{ab } { { \\mathbbm { 1}}}_{n } , \\theta^{\\alpha}=0 ,   \\label{pqsol}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is an antisymmetric constant .",
    "the result is noncommutative yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 s which obey ( [ pqsol ] ) serve as noncommutative coordinates . in the string picture",
    ", this corresponds to the appearance of noncommutative geometry in a constant b field background @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for the backgrounds of graviphoton fields , the end points of open strings have the structure of seiberg s noncommutative superspace @xcite .",
    "should the ikkt matrix model contains the whole string theory , it must have the solution which corresponds to this noncommutativity .",
    "we have provided a candidate for this vacuum in our previous paper @xcite . however , in this solution the noncommutative parameter is not an ordinary number but bi - grassmann . in the string theory ,",
    "this parameter is an ordinary number which depends on @xmath3 and graviphoton fieldstrength .",
    "thus we need to clarify the physical interpretation of this bi - grassmann structure , in order to claim that this solution of the ikkt matrix model corresponds to the string theory in the backgrounds of graviphoton field .    in this paper",
    ", we interpret this noncommutative parameter as vacuum expectation value of this solution . in the process",
    ", we will deform the path of the integral to a special path in the supernumber configuration space .",
    "our computation involves new techniques , which we will explain in detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review the concept of supernumber which is necessary to define path integrals over our new configuration space . in section 3 , we introduce novel method to compute path integrals . and",
    "we compute the commutation relation of coordinates of superspace : @xmath4 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss our method and provide the meaning of it .",
    "in this section , we introduce the concepts of supernumbers and integrals over supernumbers @xcite .",

    "we can define a function over @xmath7 as follows , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are m - th derivatives with respect to @xmath23 of usual function @xmath24 .",

    "the integrals over @xmath20 are called berezin s integral .",
    "the functions of @xmath14 can be denoted as @xmath26 , hence we define the integrals over @xmath20 as follows , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are constant supernumbers which do not depend on @xmath14 .",
