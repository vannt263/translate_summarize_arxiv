    "optical astrometry becomes important when peculiar characteristics of the pulsar emission prevent the use of radio techniques , such as timing or interferometry , to measure accurate pulsar positions .",
    "this is the case for the vela pulsar ( psr b0833 - 45 ) , whose signal shows irregularities that affect the accuracy of the radio positioning , as well as for geminga , whose radio signal appears erratic , if at all present ( kassim & lazio 1999 @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , accurate positioning of these objects has to rely on the astrometry of their faints optical counterparts .    over the years , the wfpc2 on hst has been repeatedly used to image both pulsars with the aim to measure their distances through their parallactic displacements . in order to do so , for each target a sequence of at least three observations",
    "were to be performed at the times of maximum parallactic elongation , 6 months apart , at the same date , with identical instrument set - ups . unfortunately , obtaining three time critical observations is not always an easy task .",
    "while for the v=25.5 geminga , it was possible , during cycles 4 and 5 , to collect the triplet of observations used by caraveo et al .",
    "( 1996)@xcite to infer the object s distance , for the v=23.6 vela , the cycle 6 observing programme yielded only two images ( collected in june 1997 and january 1998 ) .",
    ".summary of the hst / wfpc2 observations used in the present work . in all cases",
    "the observations were taken through filter f555w and the target was centered in the pc chip ( 45 mas / px ) .",
    "the columns give the pulsar name , the observation i d , the observing epoch , the total number of repeated exposures for each observation and the time per exposure in seconds .",
    "for each target , observations 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 define couples @xmath2 1 and @xmath3 2 , respectively [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the whole program has been repeated in cycle 8 with two images available so far ( june 1999 and january 2000 ) and a third one scheduled for july 2000 .",
    "the availability of two couples of wfpc2 observations of vela , both obtained at the same period of the year , i.e. with the same parallactic factor , and both spanning a same time interval of 2 years ( see table 1 ) , prompted us to use them to check the consistency of the procedure we have developed to superimpose wfpc2 images to measure proper motions and , eventually , parallaxes of isolated neutron stars .",
    "indeed , two similar couples of wfpc2 observations , covering a time span of 1 year each , are also available for the fainter geminga ( see tab.1 ) , for which a fourth ( unpublished ) observation can be added to the triplet used by caraveo et al .",
    "( 1996)@xcite . for both vela and geminga we can thus obtain two pure , totally independent , measurements of the proper motion , which can be used both to confirm the reproducibility and consistency of wfpc2 astrometry and to assess the weights of the known systematic errors possibly related to the target s brightness , the number of reference objects in the field , the instrument jitter , etc .",
    "after performing the standard data reduction ( otf recalibration , exposures association and cosmic ray cleaning ) , we worked on the accurate frame superposition through a grid of  good \" reference stars ( see fig.1 for an outline of the astrometric procedure ) .",
    "the reference stars coordinates were computed by 2-d gaussian fitting of their intensity profiles , yielding a positioning accurate to within 0.01 - 0.07 pixels .",

    "we then corrected the measured coordinates for the effects of the instrument geometrical distortion ( gilmozzi et al .",
    "1995 @xcite ) applying the task stsdas / metric .",
    "next step was thus the registration of the reference frames . while for vela the large number of reference stars ( 25 ) in the field ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) allowed us to follow the traditional astrometric approach ( fitting a linear transformation with 2 independent translation factors , 2 scale factors for x and y and a rotation angle ) , for geminga no more than 10 stars were available ( fig .",

    "the frame superposition turns out to be very accurate , with a rms of 0.04 and 0.08 pixels for the vela and geminga fields , respectively .    in both cases",
    "the accuracy of the superposition is determined primarily by the number of reference stars and by their relative distribution , while the algorithm used for the coordinate transformation and the correction for the ccd distortions play a less important role .",

    "the quoted uncertainties are conservative and result from a standard propagation of the errors affecting objects centroids and frame superpositions . in the case of geminga ,",
    "the higher uncertainties are due mainly to the paucity of reference stars , to the faintness of the pulsar optical counterpart and to the higher jitter value of the fouth image .",
    "last but not least , the geminga errors are diluted over a shorter time span ( 1 year vs. 2 years for vela ) .",
    "all this may contribute to the small difference ( 5 mas / yr ) between values of @xmath24 , measured for the two couples of images . in any case , the reproducibility of the results , always well within the quoted errors , gives a further demonstration of the reliability of the wfpc2 as an outstanding astrometric tool for faint targets .",
    "we can thus confidently compute a standard average for each couple of measurements .",
    "the final results , also reported in table 3 , are bound to become the reference values for the proper motions of these two nearby isolated neutron stars ."
