    "black holes are believed to be very common in the universe .",
    "a black hole itself , as indicated by its name , is invisible .",
    "but the interactions between a black hole and other objects can generate spectacular phenomena and make the hole `` visible '' .",
    "a `` clothed black hole '' , a black hole with an accretion disk ( luminet , 1978 ) , is one of the most important laboratories to study relativity .",
    "strong relativistic modifications on energy spectra , light curves , power spectra etc . , have been observed with the many detectors on the ground and in space , yet we have never observed any black hole image due to the limited spatial resolution of currently available instruments .",
    "people have been curious about what a black hole or a clothed black hole would look like .",
    "luminet ( luminet 1978 ) studied the schwarzschild black hole case and gave a simulated photograph of a spherical black hole with a thin accretion disk .",
    "fanton ( 1997 ) developed a semi - analytical approach and a code of calculating photon trajectories in kerr metric , calculated the redshift maps of both direct and secondary images , and the temperature map .",
    "we used their code in the calculation of the disk images in this work .",
    "the observable disk image is actually the flux map .",
    "however , the total flux ( in the whole energy range ) map might not be a proper object , because each instrument has its sensitive energy range ; it can only detect photons in this range , thus instruments sensitive to different energy ranges will see different pictures .    in section  [ section : redshiftmaps ]",
    "we demonstrate how the relativistic effects in a kerr space will work on various elements of a black hole system . in section  [ section : images ] we give the images in different energy ranges , followed by summary and discussion .",
    "figures  [ fig : redshiftmap ] , [ fig : overallshape ] and [ fig : inner_contour ] are all redshift maps . figures  [ fig : redshiftmap ] shows the redshift maps of disks with an outer radius @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and an inner radius as the last stable orbit . for a small viewing angle , there is only significant ( gravitational ) red - shift in the inner region ; whereas for large viewing angles , doppler shift becomes important , significant blue- and red - shift can be seen on the whole disk .",
    "( it would be clearer in color figures . ) also , for large viewing angles , far end of the disk bends toward the observer .",
    "-0.1 in     is the ratio between the observed energy of a photon and the energy in the rest frame of the disk .",
    "top to bottom : @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the inclination angle ( the angle between the normal of the disk and the line of sight ) . left to right : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the specific angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "the white zones stand for the regions with zero red - shift ( following fanton ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "left - hand side of the disk is approaching the observer and blue - shifted . ]    [ fig : redshiftmap ]    -0.1 in    figure  [ fig : overallshape ] shows the overall shape of disks due to doppler and gravitational effects at a large inclination angle ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the inner radius takes the value of the last stable circular orbit . in the first row ,",
    "the white circles and ellipses show the last stable orbit .",
    "the inner contours are greatly distorted by the focusing effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : inner_contour ] shows the comparison between shwarzschild black holes and kerr black holes , which shows clearly additional distortion due to frame - dragging effect .",
    "spin results in a smaller last stable orbit , and the inner contour changes from symmetric for @xmath7 to asymmetric for @xmath8 .",
    "therefore in principle , we can tell a rotating black hole from a non - rotating one from the inner contours of their accrection disks .",
    "-0.1 in            -0.1 in",
    "with the redshift map , we calculated images of accretion disks around black holes in several energy ranges . in the calculations , we assume 1 ) the disks are standard thin disks ( shakura & sunyaev , 1973 ) ; and 2 ) local radiation results from gravitational potential energy release through blackbody radiation ( page & thorne 1974 ) .",
