    "it is widely believed that @xcite @xmath1 theories are `` trivial '' .",
    "the conventional interpretation is based on leading - order renormalization - group - improved - perturbation - theory ( rgipt ) .",
    "however a quite different interpretation is advocated in refs .",
    "a key feature of the alternative picture is the presence of a non - trivial rescaling of the `` renormalized '' vacuum field : @xmath2 the role of @xmath3 is essential .",
    "it provides the key ingredient to get a non trivial effective potential in a `` trivial '' theory@xcite .",
    "it turns out that@xcite in the continuum limit ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 so that , although @xmath6 , one finds @xmath7 on the other hand in the continuum limit @xmath8 consistently with the trivial nature of the shifted field . in order to directly test the prediction that @xmath3 differs from @xmath9",
    ", we present the results of a lattice simulation of the theory ( in the ising limit ) where we compute the mass and the residue @xmath9 from a 2-parameter fit to the lattice data for the shifted - field propagator .",
    "we then compute the zero - momentum susceptibility @xmath10 and hence obtain the dimensionless quantity @xmath11 finally , we compare @xmath3 with @xmath9 .",

    "the shifted field propagator , defined at @xmath16 , can be computed as @xmath17 for the values @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "an excellent fit to the lattice data is obtained by using the 2-parameter formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the dimensionless lattice mass and @xmath22 ( see fig.1 ) .",

    "moreover we define @xmath26 to update our field configurations we used the swendsen - wang @xcite cluster algorithm on @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 lattices . after discarding 10k sweeps for thermalization ,",
    "we have performed 50k sweeps , measuring our observables every 5 sweeps .",
    "we have computed at different values of the hopping parameter @xmath30 in order to obtain a correlation length @xmath31 in the range 2 to @xmath32 .",
    "the upper limit of the correlation length is required in order to avoid finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath3 and @xmath9 , in the broken phase are reported in fig.2 , and show a sizeable difference for @xmath33 .",
    "[ fig2 ]    we have performed a consistency check that no such effect is present in the symmetric phase ( fig.3 ) .    [ fig3 ]    as an additional check , we have compared with available data in the literature@xcite both in the symmetric and broken phase and found good agreement .",
    "our numerical simulation of @xmath1 , in the ising limit , shows a clear difference between two _ measured _ quantities : the rescaling of the `` condensate '' @xmath3 and the more conventional quantity @xmath9 associated with the residue of the shifted field propagator .",
    "the effect shows up when increasing the correlation length and should become more and more important by approaching the continuum limit of quantum field theory @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the relation of the lattice vacuum field @xmath35 to the fermi constant and the same limits on the higgs mass can sizeably be affected .",
    "indeed , these have been based on the quantity @xcite @xmath36 rather than @xmath37 the discovery of @xmath3 requires a `` second generation '' of lattice simulations to re - check the scaling behaviour of the various quantities and compare with all available theoretical descriptions of the continuum limit .",
