    "the formation of planetesimals is a key stage in the formation of planetary systems , but at present there is little consensus about the processes involved .",
    "one class of models envisages an incremental process in which small dust grains collide , stick and settle vertically within a protoplanetary disc , with continued growth through coagulation eventually forming km - sized planetesimals @xcite .",
    "models discussed by @xcite , that assume the disc is laminar and has a surface density a few times larger than the minimum mass solar nebula model of @xcite , predict planetesimal formation times that are a few thousand local orbital periods at each location in the disc , implying formation times of @xmath6 few @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "more recent models presented by , that examine planetesimal formation in low density turbulent discs , conclude that incremental planetesimal formation is prevented by the rapid inward migration of metre - sized boulders when they form , combined with fragmentation induced by high velocity collisions caused by differential radial migration .",
    "large km - sized bodies were only obtained in these models when unrealistically large values for the critical velocity for fragmentation were adopted , and a significant increase in the dust - to - gas ratio above solar abundance was assumed . a local particle - in - a - box model of growth through dust coagulation presented by , that incorporates recent experimental results on the compactification of porous aggregates , suggests that coagulative growth beyond millimetre sizes is difficult to achieve because compacted aggregates tend to bounce rather than stick .",
    "these latter results raise serious questions about the validity of the incremental picture of planetesimal formation .",
    "a number of the difficulties faced by the incremental model have been known for many years , leading to searches for alternative planetesimal formation scenarios .",
    "gravitational instability of the dense dust layer that forms through vertical settling was suggested by @xcite as a means of forming km - sized planetesimals .",
    "although this pathway is not now widely accepted , recent models of planetesimal formation that involve collective effects , including self - gravity of regions of enhanced solids concentration , have been proposed .",
    "@xcite have developed a model in which mm - sized chondrules are concentrated in turbulent eddies , and then contract on the settling time of the solid grains under the action of self - gravity to form large @xmath1-sized planetesimals .",
    "the combined action of the streaming instability @xcite , and trapping of metre - sized boulders in short - lived turbulent eddies , has been suggested as a means of inducing planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse by @xcite , leading to the direct formation of planetesimals that are as large as the asteroid ceres ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "although these methods of forming planetesimals avoid the problem of growing beyond the metre - sized barrier , they each have their own difficulties , and as yet no clear consensus of how planetesimals form has emerged .",
    "once planetesimals have formed , runaway growth may lead to the formation of @xmath10 oligarchs on time scales of @xmath11 @xcite , which then accumulate smaller bodies to become planetary embryos and cores during the oligarchic phase @xcite .",
    "rapid runaway growth of km - sized planetesimals requires that their velocity dispersion remains significantly smaller than the escape velocity of the accreting bodies , which for @xmath12-sized objects is @xmath13 .",
    "a self - stirring swarm of planetesimals embedded in a laminar disc can maintain a low velocity dispersion via gas drag and dynamical friction , but the situation in a turbulent disc may be very different due to stochastic forcing of planetesimal random motions by the turbulence .",
    "planetesimal accretion that occurs at a rate determined by the geometric cross section may lead to planetary formation time scales in excess of observed disc life times of a few myr @xcite .",
    "a further constraint is that planetesimal collision velocities must remain below the catastrophic disruption threshold for collisional growth to occur . for planetesimals between the sizes 1 - @xmath12",
    ", disruption thresholds lie approximately in the interval @xmath14 , depending on the material strength and whether the planetesimals are monolithic bodies or rubble piles @xcite .",
    "clearly an external source of stirring , such as disc turbulence , may not only prevent runaway growth , but may lead to the collisional destruction of planetesimals .",
    "turbulence is generally believed to provide the anomalous source of viscosity required to explain the typical @xmath15 accretion rates of t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the most promising source of this is mhd turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "both local shearing box and global simulations indicate that the non linear , saturated state of the mri is vigorous turbulence that is able to transport angular momentum at a rate that can explain observations of t tauri accretion rates @xcite .",
    "but the mri requires that the gas is sufficiently ionised in order for the linear instability to operate @xcite , and for non linear turbulence to be sustained @xcite . in the absence of sufficient free electrons in the gas phase , the flow returns to a laminar state .",
    "protoplanetary discs surrounding t tauri stars are cold and dense , leading to low levels of ionisation @xcite . in the main body of these discs",
    "the primary sources of ionisation are expected to be external : stellar x - rays @xcite and possibly galactic cosmic rays @xcite , each of which have a limited penetration depth into the disc .",
    "@xcite presented a model in which the disc surface layers are ionised , and sustain a turbulent accretion flow , whereas the disc interior is a ` dead zone ' where the flow remains laminar and minimal accretion takes place .",
    "this layered accretion disc model has been the subject of numerous investigations over recent years which have examined the role of dust grains , gas - phase heavy metals @xcite , different chemical reaction networks , the role of turbulent mixing , and the hall effect @xcite .",
    "mhd simulations have also been used to examine the dynamics of magnetised discs in which a finite electrical conductivity plays an important role .",
    "@xcite examined the saturated level of turbulence as a function of the magnetic reynolds number .",
    "@xcite examined disc models in which magnetic resistivity varied with height , simulated the layered accretion model proposed by @xcite , and demonstrated that the dead zone maintains a modest reynolds stress due to waves being excited by the active layers .",
    "more recent studies have coupled time dependent chemical networks to the mhd evolution using a multi - fluid approach , and have demonstrated that turbulent diffusion of charge carriers into the dead zone can enliven it , in the absence of small dust grains .",
    "the presence of a significant population of small grains , however , reduces the time for removal of free charges from the gas phase , and the dead zone is maintained @xcite .",
    "low mass planets and planetesimals embedded in turbulent protoplanetary discs are subject to stochastic gravitational forces due to turbulent density fluctuations .",
    "the stochastic forcing leads to diffusion of the semimajor axes and excitation of the eccentricity of the embedded bodies . @xcite",
    " hereafter paper  i  examined the dynamics of planetesimals embedded in fully turbulent cylindrical disc models without dead zones , and demonstrated that the excitation of the velocity dispersion will lead to collisional disruption of planetesimals of size @xmath16 .",
    "they also demonstrated that very good agreement can be obtained between local shearing box simulations and global simulations when shearing boxes of sufficient size are employed ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in this paper , we extend the work presented in paper  i and examine the dynamics of planetesimals embedded in vertically stratified discs , with and without dead zones , using shearing box simulations .",
    "a key result is that the turbulent stirring of planetesimals is significantly reduced in discs with dead zones , possibly allowing for their continued growth rather than destruction or erosion during collisions . as such",
    ", we propose that dead zones may provide safe havens for planetesimals , and are a required ingredient for the formation of planetary systems .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we describe the physical model and numerical methods in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "the presentation of the results is divided into four parts : in section  [ sec : gas_dyn ] , we describe the general morphology and dynamics of the emerging hydromagnetic turbulence . section  [ sec : trq ] discusses how the resulting stochastic gravitational torques experienced by bodies embedded in the disc can be classified by their distribution and auto - correlation . finally , in sections  [ sec : e - growth ] and [ sec : da - grow ] , we analyse the temporal evolution in eccentricity and radial diffusion of a swarm of particles immersed in the flow . we discuss the implications of our results for planetary formation in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "after 200 orbits , the radial diffusion given by ( [ eqn : delta - x - fit ] ) corresponds to a change of semimajor axis @xmath153 for model a1 , which can be verified by inspection of figure  [ fig : vdist_cmp_dx ] . the predicted change from ( [ eqn : delta - a ] ) is @xmath154 , approximately 30% smaller than the observed value .    for model d1 , we observe a change @xmath155 , and predict a change from ( [ eqn : delta - a ] ) of @xmath156 , giving excellent agreement . for model d2 ,",
    "the observed change in semimajor axis is @xmath157 , which is approximately 25% smaller than the predicted value of @xmath158 . taking these results overall , and noting that the use of only 25 particles in the simulations implies minimal sampling errors at the 20% level , we consider the agreement between the observed and predicted levels of diffusion to be very satisfactory .    examining the longer term evolution , we use ( [ eqn : delta - x - fit ] ) to calculate the level of diffusion expected over an assumed disc life time of @xmath3 . for the fully active model , a1 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath159 , which is in good agreement with the result obtained in paper  i. for model d1 , we obtain @xmath160 , and for model d2 we obtain @xmath161 .",
    "it is clear from these values that in a vertically stratified disc sustaining mhd turbulence without a dead zone , radial diffusion is predicted to be too large to be consistent with solar system constraints . for a disc with a significant dead zone",
    "whose height extends either side of the midplane by a distance @xmath162 , however , we see that the degree of radial mixing is strongly diminished , and the results are consistent with the distribution of asteroidal taxonomic types @xcite .",
    "we now attempt to summarise our results and present a coherent picture of how the dynamics and growth of planetesimals are affected by turbulent stirring in discs with and without dead zones .",
    "we frame our discussion in the context of the three planetesimal formation models discussed in the introduction : incremental growth through particle sticking over time scales exceeding @xmath129 ; concentration of chondrules in turbulent eddies , followed by gravitational contraction on the chondrule settling time  typically @xmath163 - @xmath164 orbits @xcite ; gravitational collapse of dense clumps of metre - sized bodies formed in turbulent discs through a combination of trapping in local pressure maxima and the streaming instability @xcite .",
    "although there are significant problems with the incremental growth picture , in this paper we are interested in exploring the effects of turbulence on macroscopic bodies of sizes @xmath165 , and so it is useful for our discussion to assume an optimistic outcome for this model . toward the end of this section",
    "we also discuss some of the shortcomings of our model , and issues that are raised by these for the interpretation of our results .",
    "the results presented in section  [ sec : e - growth ] suggest that planetesimal formation and growth via a process involving mutual collisions between smaller bodies is not possible in fully turbulent discs .",
    "the rapid excitation of large random velocities which exceed the disruption / erosion threshold for planetesimals with @xmath166 will simply lead to the destruction of bodies which form in this manner .",
    "although the turbulence simulated in this paper is quite vigorous , because of the imposed vertical magnetic field , the scaling developed in paper  i for the strength of stochastic forcing as a function of the effective viscous stress suggest that even an order of magnitude decrease in the effective viscous @xmath52 value will not decrease the random velocities sufficiently to prevent catastrophic disruption from occurring .",
    "the formation of large ( @xmath167 ) planetesimals through chondrules concentrating in turbulent eddies may be possible in fully turbulent discs driven by the mri .",
    "the obvious requirement for there to be a turbulent cascade resulting in kolmogorov - scale eddies in which chondrules can concentrate would appear to be satisfied in such a disc . during the initial formation and settling stage of these objects , they are likely to be of low density and",
    "hence strongly coupled to the gas via gas drag .",
    "relative velocities on local scales relevant for collisions are likely to be small .",
    "as they contract to form  sandpile \" planetesimals , however , they will decouple from the gas and evolve dynamically like planetesimals with internal densities of @xmath168 .",
    "if formation / contraction times for these bodies are @xmath169 at @xmath8 , then turbulent stirring will cause their velocity dispersion to grow to the surface escape velocity of @xmath170 within @xmath171 , preventing runaway growth from ensuing .",
    "further collisional growth between sandpile planetesimals will therefore occur slowly . continued driving of the velocity dispersion by turbulence eventually allows @xmath74 to exceed the disruption value for @xmath1 rubble piles within approximately @xmath172 .",
    "clearly collisional growth must allow significantly larger bodies to form within this time to prevent the eventual collisional destruction of the majority of sandpile planetesimals . even if larger bodies do form that are safe against collisional disruption , questions remain about the possibility of forming large planetary cores that can accrete gas within a few myr in the absence of runaway growth .",
    "a model in which a relatively small number of large planetesimals avoid collisional destruction and grow by accreting the surrounding collisional debris may , however , provide a viable route to the growth of massive planetary cores .",
    "rapid formation of large planetesimals through the clumping of metre - size boulders , followed by their gravitational collapse , has been demonstrated in fully turbulent discs driven by the mri .",
    "although the size distribution of planetesimals arising from this process is not known accurately because of numerical limitations , the simulations produce objects with sizes similar to ceres ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "such objects have surface escape velocities of @xmath174 , and the time over which turbulent stirring generates a velocity dispersion of this magnitude is @xmath175 .",
    "it is unclear whether a population of planetesimals with an approximately unimodal size distribution centred on @xmath176 can undergo runaway growth , because of self - stirring and weak gas drag damping of eccentricities .",
    "but if it is feasible then turbulent stirring in a fully active disc such as computed in model a1 will probably not provide significant hindrance because of the long time scales required for the velocity dispersion to grow above @xmath177 .",
    "our results for model d1 show that in a model with a relatively deep dead zone , the equilibrium velocity dispersion is determined by collisional rather than gas drag damping for bodies with @xmath178 , for reasons discussed in section  [ sec : d1d2 ] .",
    "the equilibrium velocity dispersion lies between the disruption / erosion thresholds for weak and strong aggregates , suggesting that incremental collisional growth of planetesimals is possible , but depends on the material strength of the bodies . for @xmath40 bodies ,",
    "the time required to excite the velocity dispersion to the equilibrium value of @xmath179 is @xmath180 , comfortably shorter than the formation time of km - sized planetesimals at @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the time required to excite @xmath114 bodies to their equilibrium random velocities is @xmath181 , comparable to our assumed formation time for these bodies through incremental growth . at each stage during the incremental growth of planetesimals within the dead zone , the planetesimals will have velocity dispersions close to the equilibrium values , which then control in - part the formation and growth rates . but provided the material strength of the planetesimals is sufficient ( larger than that for weak aggregates ) , planetesimal growth should be possible in a dead zone through collisional agglomeration , so long as the bouncing and metre - size barriers can be overcome .    runaway growth of km - sized planetesimals requires the velocity dispersion to be significantly lower than the escape velocity from the accreting bodies , and for @xmath12 planetesimals @xmath182 .",
    "results from model d1 indicate that a velocity dispersion of this magnitude will be excited within @xmath183 , effectively quenching the runaway growth",
    ". continued collisional growth can still proceed , since the velocity dispersion remains below the disruption / erosion threshold ( at least for strong aggregates and rubble piles ) , and the equilibrium velocity dispersion for @xmath12 objects @xmath184 is not reached until after @xmath185 . if growth ensues quickly enough , the eventual formation of bodies with @xmath186 will allow runway growth of these planetesimals to occur .",
    "model d1 shows that the time required to raise the velocity dispersion up to the escape velocity @xmath187 for these bodies is @xmath188 . in this general picture",
    ", the influence of stochastic gravitational forces acting on planetesimals in a dead zone can cause the postponement of runaway growth for @xmath12 planetesimals , but once @xmath1 sized bodies form , rapid runaway growth produce numerous @xmath10 sized oligarchs which will then undergo oligarchic growth to form planetary embryos and cores .",
    "this general picture of delayed runaway growth is similar in concept to that suggested by @xcite for planet formation in binary systems .    the formation of sandpile planetesimals via the concentration of chondrules within turbulent eddies should be possible in a dead zone , provided that the reynolds stress generated there is indicative of a turbulent flow with an energy cascade resulting in kolmogorov - eddies in which millimetre particles",
    "can become trapped . at the present time it is not clear that this is an accurate description of the dead zone flow , as the reynolds stress appears to be largely due to spiral density waves that are stochastically excited in the disc active regions , and undergo non linear damping as their wavelengths shorten during radial propagation through the disc @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of high resolution simulations is required to examine the nature of the flow in the dead zone . assuming that @xmath1 sandpile planetesimals can form",
    ", the slow growth of the velocity dispersion means that turbulent stirring can not provide an impediment to subsequent runaway growth .",
    "similar comments apply to the rapid formation of planetesimals in dead zones via the mechanism described in @xcite .",
    "formation in this case is driven to a large degree by trapping of metre - size bodies in pressure maxima ( localised regions of anticyclonic vorticity ) generated by turbulence , and these are not as prominent in the midplane of a disc with a dead zone .",
    "this suggests that the streaming instability models in laminar discs presented in @xcite may provide a more promising avenue for rapid planetesimal formation in dead zones .",
    "once large planetesimals form , the possible onset of runaway growth will not be inhibited by the weak stochastic excitation of the velocity dispersion in a dead zone .",
    "we now consider the possible effects of assumptions we have made in our models that may affect their outcomes and the conclusions we have drawn from them .",
    "the disc model we adopt in this study is lower in mass by a factor of @xmath189 than disc models that have been used as the basis for successful models of giant planet formation @xcite .",
    "but it should be noted that these models often neglected the effects of planetary migration which can enable planetary embryos to grow beyond their isolation masses , thus assisting in the formation of giant planets within expected disc life times .",
    "if relative density perturbations in the dead zone remain the same when the disc mass is increased , then a higher disc mass will lead to a corresponding increase in turbulent stirring , making planetesimal destruction / erosion more likely .",
    "but , in a disc where the ionisation sources are external ( stellar x - rays , galactic cosmic rays ) , the column density and mass of the active zone are almost independent of the total disc mass / surface density , and depend primarily on the penetration depth of the ionising sources .",
    "consequently , we may expect the relative density fluctuations near the midplane in the dead zone to be weaker in a heavier disc than in a lighter disc , potentially providing a less destructive source of gravitational stirring . at present",
    "it is unclear how turbulent stirring in a dead zone scales with the disc mass , and studying this issue is difficult from the computational point of view .",
    "the shearing box models we present here are extended in the @xmath190 and @xmath191 directions compared to those used in most studies , and include @xmath192 scale heights above and below the midplane . increasing the disc mass moves the boundary between the dead and active zones further from the midplane , such that the vertical computational domain must be extended significantly to accommodate the active zone , increasing the computational expense .",
    "it is our intention to address this issue in a future study .",
    "we have assumed a particular configuration for the initial magnetic fields in our simulations that includes a small but non - negligible net - flux vertical component .",
    "it is well known that the existence and strength of net - flux magnetic fields changes the saturation level of developed mhd turbulence in simulations of the mri @xcite .",
    "a future study of planetesimal dynamics embedded in turbulent discs with dead zones should examine the role played by the field topology and strength .      in our estimates of collisional",
    "damping we assume that all planetesimals are the same size , and that all solids are incorporated into planetesimals . the latter assumption is broadly consistent with our disc model , in which we assume that 90% of the dust has been depleted due to the growth of grains into larger bodies . but the assumption of a single planetesimal size is not realistic . a more accurate calculation of the role of collisional damping would require a self - consistent model of accretion and fragmentation such that the size distribution is modelled self - consistently .",
    "unfortunately such a model goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "when estimating the scale height of the planetesimal disc during the calculation of collisional damping rates , we assumed that @xmath193 ( i.e. the velocity dispersion is isotropic ) . in a turbulent disc , however , where a significant component of the stochastic gravitational field is generated by spiral density waves that have little vertical structure",
    ", we should expect that the eccentricity growth exceeds that of the inclination .",
    "our simulation results , however , show that for models d1 and d2 the inclination growth actually exceeds that of the eccentricity . this surprising result arises because the disc midplane ( centre of mass in the @xmath194-direction ) , oscillates vertically with an amplitude that reaches @xmath195 , causing an oscillation of similar magnitude in the planetesimals .",
    "future simulations of planetesimals within dead zones will be computed using global models to examine how robust this phenomenon is , although we note that a similar vertical oscillation has been reported in the shearing box simulations presented by @xcite .",
    "wave propagation in discs is strongly influenced by the equation of state @xcite .",
    "this may affect the ability of waves that are excited in the active regions to propagate into the dead zone , and thus affect the turbulent stirring there .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper all adopted an isothermal equation of state , whereas protoplanetary discs are expected to be optically thick at @xmath8 .    for parameters typical of t tauri stars , the primary heating mechanism near",
    "the midplane is the absorption of the radiation emitted by the disc atmosphere , which in turn heats mainly by absorbing light from the central star @xcite .",
    "the accretion heating also occurs in the atmosphere , leading to a thoroughly isothermal interior when a dead zone is present @xcite .",
    "the role of the equation of state in determining the level of turbulent stirring at the midplane will be explored in a future publication .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of simulations of planetesimals embedded in local models of protoplanetary discs .",
    "the main aim of this work is to understand the dynamics of planetesimals in turbulent discs , and to examine how dead zones of varying vertical thicknesses change the stochastic forcing of the radial velocity dispersion , and the diffusion of planetesimal semimajor axes .",
    "we consider the influence of gas drag and collisional damping in counteracting the growth of random velocities due to turbulent stirring , and estimate the equilibrium velocity dispersions which result .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows .",
    "the presence and depth of a dead zone have negligible effect on the measured coherence time of the particle stirring , but only affect its amplitude as measured through the width of the torque distribution .    in fully turbulent discs without dead zones ,",
    "we find that the velocity dispersion of embedded planetesimals grows rapidly , and quickly exceeds the threshold for disruption for planetesimals in the size range @xmath196 .",
    "we conclude that planetesimal formation via collisional accretion of smaller bodies can not occur in globally turbulent discs .",
    "the direct formation of large @xmath1-sized planetesimals via turbulent concentration and gravitational instability @xcite may occur , but the excitation of their random velocities may prevent runaway growth , making it difficult to form large planetary embryos and cores within reasonable disc life times .",
    "radial diffusion of planetesimals occurs over distances of @xmath197 in fully turbulent discs over typical disc life times of @xmath3 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed correlation between asteroid taxonomic types and heliocentric distance in the asteroid belt , which indicate radial mixing over distances @xmath198 during the formation of the solar system .",
    "it thus seems implausible that the solar nebula sustained levels of turbulence observed in numerical simulations of fully turbulent discs .",
    "the stochastic forcing of planetesimal random motions is much weaker in discs with dead zones . in a dead zone with vertical extent @xmath199 above and below the midplane",
    ", the stochastic excitation of planetesimal eccentricities is reduced by a factor @xmath200 relative to a fully active disc .",
    "the damping of planetesimal random motions in this model is dominated by collisional damping , and the equilibrium velocity dispersions lie between the disruption thresholds for weak and strong aggregates .",
    "it thus appears that the collisional growth and formation of km - sized planetesimals may be possible in a dead zone .",
    "but , we note that the tidal break - up of comet shoemaker - levy 9 @xcite , and analysis of the collision ejecta from comet tempel 1 during the deep impact mission @xcite , suggest that cometary bodies possess modest material strength .",
    "it therefore remains uncertain what range of collision velocities can be tolerated during the incremental growth of km - sized planetesimals as envisaged in the models of @xcite and .",
    "although km - sized planetesimals may be able form within a dead zone , subject to overcoming the metre - sized and bouncing barriers , stochastic forcing by the turbulent disc excites random velocities above the escape velocity for @xmath201 bodies within @xmath129 , quenching runaway growth .",
    "slower growth of planetesimals through collisions remains possible , and runaway growth can ensue once bodies with @xmath186 form , due to the slow growth of random velocities within a dead zone . if @xmath202 ` oligarchs ' form , oligarchic growth can proceed with very modest influence from the weak stochastic forcing in the dead zone .",
    "a corollary of this is that @xmath1-sized planetesimals that form through the concentration of particles and subsequent gravitational instability in a dead zone will not be prevented from undergoing runaway growth by turbulent stirring .    in summary ,",
    "we come to the following specific conclusions regarding the outcome of our present study :    * comparing the results obtained for dead zones with different vertical heights ( @xmath203 and @xmath204 ) , we find that the larger dead zone model clearly favours the collisional formation of planetesimals because of weaker stochastic forcing of random motions . * the radial diffusion of planetesimals",
    "is much reduced in discs with dead zones relative to fully active discs .",
    "diffusion over a distance equal to @xmath205 is predicted by our deeper dead zone model , consistent with solar system constraints .",
    "* the low diffusion levels for planetesimal semimajor axes in dead zones clearly means that stochastic torques in such an environment can not prevent the large scale inward drift of low mass planets via type i migration .",
    "* we suggest that dead zones provide safe havens for km - sized planetesimals against destructive collisions , and are probably a required ingredient for the formation of planetary systems .",
    "this paper is part of series in which we are examining the dynamics of planetesimals and planets in increasingly realistic disc models , and shows that different qualitative outcomes for planet formation can be expected in discs with dead zones versus those without . in future publications we will examine a number of issues , including how changing the disc surface density and the mass ratio between the active and dead zones modifies the turbulent stirring , and how turbulence varies as a function of heliocentric distance in global mhd simulations of protoplanetary discs .",
