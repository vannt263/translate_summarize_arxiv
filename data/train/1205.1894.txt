    "in the theory of planet formation , planets are thought to have formed in protoplanetary disks through mutual collisions and coalescence of planetesimals .",

    "* ) . in these models of planetesimal formation ,",
    "motion of dust grains is an important factor because it determines the spatial distribution of dust grains and the collision speed between them .",
    "furthermore , their motion is governed by the drag forces from the disk gas .",
    "gas drag forces on dust grains strongly depend on their internal structure ( or their bulk densities ) .",
    "most studies of dust growth in protoplanetary disks have assumed compact structure of dust grains .",
    "however , dust grains growing through mutual collisions would actually be aggregates of ( sub - micron ) primitive grains and the aggregates have a fluffy structure with an extremely low bulk density , as reported by experimental and theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such fluffy aggregates have large ratios of their geometrical cross sections to masses , which significantly enhance gas drag forces on them compared with compact dust grains .",
    "hence , in order to clarify dust growth and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks , we have to examine the internal structure and the geometrical cross sections of dust aggregates ( we use a term ` cross section ' in referring to ` geometrical cross section ' , hereafter ) .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s08 ) performed @xmath0-body numerical simulations of sequential aggregate collisions to examine the compression process of growing aggregates .",
    "the sequential collisions mean that we repeat collisions of aggregates obtained at the previous collisions . with such a simulation , we can observe a natural evolution of the aggregate structure .",
    "their numerical results showed that large aggregates have an extremely low bulk density in spite of compression at aggregate collisions . in the early stage of dust growth",
    ", aggregates just stick without any restructuring because of their low impact energy and they have a fluffy structure with an extremely low bulk density as they grow . in the later stage in which the impact energy exceeds a critical energy ,",
    "aggregates are gradually compressed . even in this compression stage , their density remains very low .",
    "it is found that the compressed aggregates have a low fractal dimension of 2.5 .",
    "this structural feature causes the low density of the compressed aggregates .",
    "s08 also derived a formula describing the density evolution of growing aggregates .",
    "to estimate their bulk densities , s08 used the so - called gyration radii of the aggregates but did not examine their cross sections .",
    "however , cross sections are directly related to the gas drag forces rather than gyration radii .",
    "it is necessary to clarify the evolution of cross sections of dust aggregates during their growth .",
    "cross sections of aggregates depend on their internal structure .",
    "there are two simple aggregate models . one is ballistic cluster - cluster aggregation ( bcca ) . a bcca cluster is formed through collisions between two equal - sized clusters .",
    "second is ballistic particle - cluster aggregation ( bpca ) .",
    "a bpca cluster is formed through deposition of small monomer particles on a large cluster . for both bcca and bpca ,",
    "restructuring is assumed to be negligible at each collision .",
    "the bcca clusters have very fluffy and open structures and the bpca clusters have relatively compact structures .",
    "figure  [ fig : spmintro ] shows the ratios of cross sections to masses of aggregates .",
    "it is shown that the cross section per mass strongly depend on aggregate types .",
    "cross sections of dust aggregates are expected to be between those of bcca and bpca clusters .",
    "one may consider that a cross section is approximately given by the square of a gyration radius .",
    "cross sections of aggregates are , however , generally independent of their gyration radii , especially for highly fluffy aggregates .",
    "the non - dimensional ratio of the cross section to the square of the gyration radius gradually decreases with their growth for bcca clusters ( minato et al .",
    "2006 ; see also fig .",
    "6 ) . on the other hand",
    ", this ratio is almost constant in the growth of bpca clusters .",
    "okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed a useful relation between the cross section and the gyration radius for various aggregates formed through hit - and - stick growth ( as well as bcca and bpca ) .",
    "paszun and dominik ( 2009 ) also derived another relation .",
    "nevertheless , it is not clear whether these relations are also valid for aggregates compressed at collisions .",
    "we check the validity of these relations , using the resultant aggregates obtained by s08 .",
    "once we find a valid relation between the cross sections and the gyration radii , it would be very helpful to describe the evolution of the cross sections because the compression model by s08 can describe gyration radii of growing aggregates .",
    "the compression model by s08 , however , has some limitations .",
    "this model is not directly applicable to low - energy collisions ( i.e. , hit - and - stick collisions ) or to non - equal - mass collisions . in order to describe gyration radii and cross sections of aggregates for all growth stages seamlessly",
    ", we further refine the compression model , by removing these limitations .    in laboratory experiments , @xcite examined compression of aggregates consisting of 1.5@xmath1m - diameter sio@xmath2 spheres at their multiple rebounds and also developed an empirical compression model .",
    "initial aggregates in their experiments possess a volume filling factor of @xmath3 , which is approximately equal to that of bpca clusters .",
    "on the other hand , s08 and the present paper focus on the compression of fluffier aggregates of which filling factor is between bcca and bpca clusters during their collisional growth .",
    "hence our compression model and theirs are complementary to each other .",
    "as mentioned above , dust aggregates are expected to have much smaller bulk densities than bpca clusters at the early stage of their growth in protoplanetary disks .",
    "our compression model is useful as long as bulk densities of aggregates is lower than that of bpca clusters",
    ".    it should be noticed that s08 only considered head - on collisions of aggregates in their numerical simulations of sequential collisions .",
    "the oblique collisions are expected to hinder the compression ( wada et al .",
    "2007 ; paszun and dominik 2009 ) . in the present study , however , we use the results in s08 as the first step .",
    "we will examine the effects of oblique collisions in future work .",
    "in the next section , we briefly summarize the results of s08 . in section 3 ,",

    "the parameter range of @xmath8 is set to be from 2 to 16 @xmath9 in s08 .",
    "a large rolling energy @xmath5 suppresses the restructuring of aggregates . to examine the structure evolution of growing aggregates , s08 performed @xmath0-body simulations of sequential collisions .",

    "the impact velocity is constant in sequential collisions .",
    "for various ( constant ) impact velocities and critical rolling displacements , they performed a large number of runs of sequential collisions .",

    "the size of small aggregates produced in our simulation is almost the same as that of bcca clusters .",

    "we will describe the compression model in section 4 .",
    "we numerically calculate cross sections of resultant aggregates obtained by s08 .",
    "the cross section of a dust aggregate is given by the area of the shadow of the aggregate projected onto a plane .",

    "fig : ssmosikizu ] ) .",
    "the width of the square meshes is set to be @xmath33 .",
    "this width is much smaller than the radius of the monomer particle , @xmath34 , though meshes with a much wider width are drawn to emphasize them in figure  [ fig : ssmosikizu ] .",
    "the area of the shadow is dependent on the plane onto which the shadow is projected .",
    "we calculate the areas of the shadows for 30 orientations randomly chosen and define the cross section of the aggregate by the mean values of the areas .",
    "figure  [ fig : ss1headon ] shows the cross section calculated in this way for aggregates produced in the simulations of sequential collisions .",
    "the vertical axis is the cross section divided by @xmath35 , which corresponds to the ( non - dimensional ) cross section per mass . if the overlapping of the monomer particles in the shadow is negligibly small , the value of the vertical axis approaches unity . a filled circle in figure  [ fig : ss1headon]a indicates the shadow area for each orientation and the line shows the mean of them . the cross section per mass decreases as an aggregate grows in the simulation of sequential collisions due to the overlapping of the constituent particles .",
    "since s08 did 30 independent runs of sequential collisions , the mean cross sections are calculated and plotted as thin lines in figure  [ fig : ss1headon]b .",
    "then we obtain the averaged value of the 30 mean cross sections as shown by the thick line in figure  [ fig : ss1headon]b .",
    "the dispersion of the mean geometrical cross section can be evaluated in figure  [ fig : ss1headon]b .",
    "the standard deviation of the mean geometrical cross section is equal to or less than 11% of its averaged value during the aggregate growth . in this way , we did two kinds of averaging to calculate the cross section of growing aggregates in the simulation .",
    "we show and discuss the cross sections of aggregates by using these finally - obtained cross sections hereafter .",
    "figure  [ fig : ssheadon ] shows the cross section of resultant aggregates for various values of the parameter set ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the averaged cross section of the bcca cluster is also calculated and plotted .",
    "the cross section of bcca we obtained agrees with the result of @xcite . even for bcca ,",
    "the ratio @xmath37 gradually decreases with an increase in @xmath0 due to the overlapping of constituent particles . in the early stage of the aggregate growth ( i.e. for small @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the cross sections of the resultant aggregates change almost along the line of bcca .",
    "as the aggregates grow , however , their cross sections deviate from the line of bcca and become much smaller than that of bcca , which is due to compression at collisions .",
    "this qualitative tendency is consistent with the evolution of the radius of gyration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rgrho]a ) .",
    "although the change in the cross sections is gradual and the starting points of compression in the cross sections are not clear compared with those in the gyration radii , the starting points are also described by equation  ( [ ncrit ] ) , by setting the parameter @xmath29 to be 2.0 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath29 than figure  [ fig : rgrho ] indicates that the onset of compression in the cross section is later than that in the gyration radius .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ssrgheadon ] we plot the ratio of the cross section @xmath38 to @xmath39 for all resultant aggregates with solid lines .",
    "the ratio of @xmath38 to @xmath39 decreases for small aggregates , which is consistent with the bcca case ( dotted lines ) . for sufficiently large aggregates ,",
    "the ratio increases as a result of their compression .",
    "okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed a useful expression of the cross section @xmath38 for aggregates formed through hit - and - sticks .",
    "the expression is given by @xmath40 where the cross section of the bcca cluster is given by ( minato et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath41 equation  ( [ bccarg ] ) is used as the expression of @xmath42 .",
    "we also plotted the cross sections obtained from equation ( [ s - o09 ] ) with dashed lines in figure  [ fig : ssrgheadon ] .",
    "it is found that the expression by okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) reproduces the cross section surprisingly well for compressed aggregates as well as hit - and - stick aggregates , by using the gyration radius @xmath10 . in this expression , the information of compression is correctly included through the gyration radius .",
    "paszun and dominik ( 2009 ) also derived another relation between @xmath38 and the aggregate size ( i.e. , eq.[11 ] of their paper ) .",
    "figure  7 is the same as the left - bottom panel of figure  6 but the prediction by paszun and dominik is also plotted .",
    "although the prediction by paszun and dominik is consistent with the numerical results , it overestimates @xmath38 when the ratio @xmath43 is larger than unity ( i.e. , for relatively compact aggregates ) and underestimates for @xmath44 .",
    "the underestimation was also reported by okuzumi et al .",
    "they found that the underestimation in paszun and dominik s model is severe especially for large and fluffy aggregates .",
    "for other @xmath45 , we also find the same trend as in the case of @xmath46 shown in figure  [ fig : ssrgheadon2 ] .",
    "hence it is concluded that the model of okuzumi et al .",
    "is more accurate than that of paszun and dominik .",
    "once an accurate compression model describing @xmath10 is obtained , it enables us to calculate the evolution of the cross section with the help of okuzumi et al s model .",
    "a compression model describing @xmath10 was developed by s08 but it has two limitations . the model is not directly applicable to low - energy collisions ( i.e. , hit - and - stick collisions at the early growth stage ) or to non - equal - mass collisions . in order to describe gyration radii and cross sections of aggregates for both the early hit - and - stick stage and the compression stage seamlessly , we refine our compression model , by removing these limitations in a natural way . before that , we briefly describe the compression model by s08 .      w08 developed a compression model by introducing the pressure ( or the strength ) of aggregates to explain their numerical results on collisions between bcca clusters .",

    "the volumes before and after the compression are evaluated with the radius of gyration , @xmath10 , as in equation  ( [ vdef ] ) .",

    "w08 showed with their simulation of collisions between bcca clusters that the compressed aggregates have internal structures with a fractal dimension of 2.5 .",
    "the simulation of sequential collisions done by s08 showed that their resultant aggregates also have the same fractal dimension of 2.5 .    in order to describe the compression of such fractal aggregates , w08 also introduced the fractal volume defined by @xmath54 where the coefficient @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 . using the fractal volume ,",

    "with this setting of the parameters , the refined model reproduces well the numerical results at both the early growth stage and the compression stage .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfitoku ] shows the evolution of the cross sections and indicates that the refined model also succeeds in describing the cross sections with the help of equation  ( [ s - o09 ] ) .    in the above",
    ", the evolution of gyration radius of growing aggregates are calculated with the refined compression model and their cross sections are indirectly calculated , by using @xmath10 and equation  ( [ s - o09 ] ) .",
    "we also propose another way to describe the cross sections of aggregates .",
    "we define alternative characteristic sizes of aggregates @xmath116 by @xmath117 it would be possible to describe the evolution of @xmath116 directly ( instead of the gyration radius ) with the refined compression model in the following way . using this characteristic size @xmath116 instead of @xmath118 , we can define the volume and the bulk density of the aggregate by the similar equations to ( [ vdef ] ) and ( [ rhodef ] ) .",
    "the fractal volume and the fractal density are also defined in the same way .",
    "then , applying the refined compression model to the fractal density defined with @xmath116 , we can describe the evolution of @xmath116 as well as in the case of @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of the cross section @xmath38 is calculated with equation  ( [ eq : rs ] ) .",
    "this is a direct way to describe the cross section rather than the above . in this calculation of @xmath38",
    ", we have to be cautious with the following two points .",
    "one is the modification in equation  ( [ vdash ] ) . at a collision of sufficiently fluffy aggregates , equation  ( [ vdash ] ) can give the volume @xmath83 larger than that of the bcca cluster with the same mass , @xmath119 when the size @xmath116 is used instead of @xmath10 .",
    "such a large @xmath83 is not realistic . in this case",
    ", we set the volume @xmath120 instead of equation  ( [ vdash ] ) .",
    "the other point is the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "although @xmath53 is set to be 0.15 in the case of @xmath10 , we have to calibrate the parameter @xmath53 again in the case of @xmath116 as a result of the fitting with numerical results . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfit ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath38 calculated with this direct way . in this calculation , the parameters are set to be @xmath121 and @xmath94 .",
    "we see that the refined model works well for the evolution of the cross sections with this direct way , too .",
    ", we used @xmath120 instead of equation  ( [ vdash ] ) when the volume of equation  ( [ vdash ] ) is larger than @xmath119 , as mentioned above . ]",
    "it is found that the refined compression model enables us to describe the whole evolution of the radius of gyration @xmath10 and the cross section @xmath38 of growing aggregates .",
    "note that the refined model is applicable to non - equal - mass collisions though the tests in figure  [ fig : rgfit]-[fig : sfit ] are done only in the equal - mass case . at the extension of the refined model to non - equal - mass collisions ,",
    "the fractal dimension of compressed aggregates is assumed to be 2.5 even in the case of non - equal - mass collisions though it is not verified with @xmath0-body simulations in non - equal - mass cases .",
    "it is possible that a very large mass ratio increases the fractal dimension , as seen in bpca clusters .",
    "okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) examined the effect of the mass ratio on the fractal dimension for aggregates growing with hit - and - stick collisions with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "they showed that the collisions with the mass ratio of 10 increases the fractal dimension @xmath122 only by 0.1 ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , collisions with such a mass ratio have a major contribution at dust growth in protoplanetary disks , as shown by okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2009,2012 ) .",
    "hence the effect of non - equal - mass collisions would not change largely the fractal dimension of compressed aggregates in the realistic growth process .    to confirm the validity of the refined model in non - equal - mass collisions , we have further performed additional @xmath0-body simulations of aggregate collisions .",
    "similar to w08 , we consider collisions of two bcca clusters but their masses are not equal in the present case .",
    "the projectile bcca cluster consists of 1024 particles ( or 4096 particles ) while the number of constituent particles of the target bcca cluster is 16384 .",
    "their mass ratio is @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) .",
    "the constituent particles are icy ones with the radius with 0.1@xmath1 m. the impact velocity @xmath125 is a parameter .",
    "we set @xmath126ms@xmath127 since we focus on the compression process rather than fragmentation ( wada et al .",
    "2007,2008 ) .",
    "the numerical results of compression at the non - equal - mass collisions are shown in figure  [ fig : additional ] .",
    "the predictions by the refined model with @xmath75 are plotted by solid lines and the dashed line indicates the formula by w08 ( their equation  [ 45 ] ) .",
    "the numerical results in the non - equal - mass collisions approximately agree with the predictions by the refined model though upper shifts by @xmath12820% are observed in the case of @xmath129 . as well as in the case of equal - mass collisions , the slope in @xmath10-@xmath130 relation",
    "is approximately given by -0.1 , which indicates that compressed aggregates have the fractal dimension of 2.5 .",
    "the upper shifts in the numerical results indicate that the compression requires larger impact energy in non - equal - mass collisions than the equal - mass case .",
    "this effect in non - equal - mass collisions would be included by adopting a larger parameter @xmath53 in the refined model .",
    "furthermore , for high - mass - ratio collisions with @xmath131 , the refined model is not verified through @xmath0-body simulations yet although such collisions have only a minor contribution in dust growth ( okuzumi et al .",
    "2009,2012 ) . in the future work",
    ", the effect of non - equal - mass collisions should be further examined in the numerical simulation of sequential collisions as done by s08 in order to calibrate the parameter @xmath53 more accurately .",
    "we examined the evolution of the geometrical cross section of the growing ( icy ) aggregates obtained by @xmath0-body simulations of sequential head - on collisions ( s08 ) and constructed to construct a refined compression model , which is applicable to the description of the evolution of both geometrical cross sections and gyration radii of growing aggregates .",
    "the results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we examined geometrical cross sections of the aggregates produced in the simulation of sequential collisions done in our previous paper .",
    "as aggregates grow , compression becomes effective and makes their cross sections smaller than those of the bcca clusters .",
    "the beginning of the compression is given by equation  ( [ ncrit ] ) , as seen in the evolution of the gyration radius .",
    "the relation between the cross section and the gyration radius seen in aggregates obtained by s08 is well described by okuzumi et al s expression .",
    "this indicates that okuzumi et al s expression is valid for compressed aggregates as well as hit - and - stick aggregates .",
    "if the evolution of the gyration radius is well described by a compression model , okuzumi et al s expression enables us to calculate the cross section , too .",
    "3 .   we further refined the compression model of s08 , by including the compression energy for the voids produced at the sticking of two aggregates .",
    "the refined model is also extended to non - equal - mass collisions in a reasonable way . with the refined model",
    ", we can accurately reproduce the evolution of both the gyration radius and the cross section of aggregates obtained by s08 from their early growth stage .",
    "the validity of the refined compression model for non - equal - mass collisions is also checked by additional numerical simulations of bcca collisions . although s08 considered only icy aggregates in the numerical simulation , our compression model would be also applicable to silicate aggregates by using a suitable value of @xmath5 .",
    "our @xmath0-body simulations of aggregate collisions and the refined compression model indicate that collisional compression is not so effective . as a result , dust aggregates ( or initial planetesimal material )",
    "would have extremely low bulk densities , as suggested by s08 .",
    "okuzumi et al .",
    "( 2012 ) showed that such extremely low bulk densities of aggregates accelerate their growth in protoplanetary disks and help their overcoming of the radial drift barrier against the planetesimal formation .",
    "however , solar - system bodies do not have such low densities at present . dust aggregates ( or planetesimals ) should be compressed by other processes . a steady ram pressure due to",
    "the gas drag on aggregates and a self - gravity of sufficiently large aggregates would be candidates for aggregate compression , as indicated by s08 and okuzumi et al .",
    "for relatively compact dust cakes ( @xmath132g@xmath133@xmath134 ) made of micron - sized silicate particles , compression is observed at a pressure @xmath135pa ( blum and schrpler 2004 ) .",
    "however , for icy aggregates with very low bulk densities ( @xmath136g@xmath133@xmath134 ) , compressive strength has not yet been measured . in future work , compression strength of very fluffy aggregates",
    "should be measured in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments .    in the present study , we focus on the aggregates obtained at head - on collisions . at oblique collisions ,",
    "the merged aggregates are elongated ( w07 ; paszun and dominik 2009 ) .",
    "although our model indicates inefficient compression at aggregate collisions , the effect of oblique collisions would further hinder compression .",
    "in future work , we should clarify the validity of our compression model in the case where oblique collisions are included .",
