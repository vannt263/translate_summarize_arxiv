    "in bottom - up hierarchical structure formation models , larger overdensities are more strongly correlated . in figure",
    "[ fig : dencorr ] ( left panel ) we show how this relationship is manifested along one - dimensional redshift - space lines of sight through our simulation . we compute the excess number of pairs of pixels having densities ( normalized to the cosmic mean ) in the ranges typical of the ly@xmath0  forest , relative to a randomly distributed set of such pixels . despite smearing by peculiar velocities , higher overdensities",
    "are still more strongly correlated , though in velocity - space the correlation length is only @xmath15  km / s . note that the correlation _ length _ does not increase with density , contrary to what one finds in large - scale structure studies where e.g. the correlation length of clusters is higher than that of galaxies .",
    "also , it is evident that the density correlation does nt change from @xmath16 , indicating stable clustering of ly@xmath0  forest structures .    at high redshift",
    ", the density is tightly correlated with the optical depth of ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "hence we would expect that ly@xmath0  optical depths would reflect correlations in the density .",
    "the evolution of such correlations would then , in principle , reflect the evolution of bias for a particular optical depth , since the density correlations are not evolving .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : dencorr ] shows the correlations for pixels with optical depths @xmath17 . according to cen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this measure most accurately reflects the underlying matter correlation , at least at @xmath18 .",
    "note that here we are using the noise - added spectra , with the optical depth computed by inverting the flux , so the @xmath19 limits are actually flux limits of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : dencorr ] ( right panel ) shows that the flux correlations indeed show similar trends as density correlations at @xmath21 and 1 , but by @xmath22 the optical depth limits do not clearly delineate density cuts .",
    "furthermore , even from @xmath23 the correlation strength ( for @xmath24  km / s ) has evolved very little , despite a comparatively large evolution in the photoionizing background that governs the bias ( see e.g. figure  7 in dav & tripp 2001 ) . at @xmath22 , there is even a significant _ anti - correlation _ for @xmath25 pixels , until @xmath26  km / s .",
    "thus , disappointingly , it appears that the pixel flux ( or optical depth ) correlations do not straightforwardly trace the evolution of the ly@xmath0  forest bias .",
    "the canonical method for studying ly@xmath0  absorbers is by profile - fitting individual features . at high redshifts ,",
    "studies indicate that ly@xmath0  lines are uncorrelated for @xmath27 . in these proceedings ,",
    "low - redshift stis spectra of tripp et al . and williger et al .",
    "show significant excess correlations of lines over a random distribution out to @xmath28  km / s , for absorbers with @xmath29 .",
    "the implication is that the correlation strength at this column density has increased with time , which is ( qualitatively ) expected from simulations since a given column density absorber is associated with higher overdensities at lower redshifts ( dav et al .",
    "conversely , a poster by heap et al . indicates no significant absorber correlations in a sightline towards 3c273 ( @xmath30 ) , where the typical absorber has a lower column density ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "these results lend broad support to the bias evolution model given by simulations , but at present are insufficient to precisely constrain the bias evolution from high to low redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr ] ( left panel ) shows our line correlation function for various column density limits , at @xmath32 .",
    "the line correlations at a given @xmath33 grow with time , in agreement with observations . at @xmath21 ,",
    "virtually no correlations are seen in any column density range , while at @xmath22 significant correlations are seen out to @xmath34  km / s , for stronger lines .",
    "these trends are also in broad agreement with observations .",
    "note also the interesting drop in correlation strength at @xmath35  km / s ; this is likely sensitive to line deblending algorithms , but may be an interesting regime for comparing simulations to observations if identical profile fitting routines are used .    still , there seems to be no direct relationship between correlations computed from density cuts ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : dencorr ] ) and from lines with column density cuts , meaning that while current simulations broadly reproduce observed line correlations , such correlations are also not simply related to the bias of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "recent observations suggest a significant number of lines present in the local universe . such lines may arise in collisionally ionized  warm - hot \" gas or in very low density photoionized gas .",
    "simulations roughly match the observed number density per unit redshift of lines by assuming [ o / h]@xmath36 and a quasar - dominated flux ( e.g. chen et al . 2002 ) , with stronger absorbers tending to be collisionally ionized and the weaker absorbers photoionized ( cen et al .",
    "2001 , fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "the correlation of lines can , in principle , be used as a diagnostic to determine their origin , based on a comparison of their clustering strength with that of absorbers .",
    "a complication is that the metallicity and far - uv ionization conditions of the igm are poorly determined .",
    "we compute line correlations from our simulation by assuming a haardt & madau ( 1996 ) ionizing background and a spatially - uniform metallicity that grows with time : [ o / h]@xmath37 at @xmath21 , [ o / h]@xmath38 at @xmath39 , and [ o / h]@xmath40 at @xmath22 .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable but fairly arbitrary , as observational constraints are poor ( see prochaska , these proceedings , for a review ) .",
    "we also extract spectra with only absorption , neglecting the real - world complication of blending with .",
    "figure  [ fig : corr ] ( right panel ) shows the resulting correlation function based on these assumptions .",
    "it is clear that stronger lines are more strongly correlated , particularly at @xmath39 and 2 .",
    "this indicates that many of these lines are photoionized , because collisionally ionized absorbers should have their column density virtually uncorrelated with density . at @xmath22 ,",
    "this is not so clear , indicating more lines at these column densities may be collisionally ionized .",
    "furthermore , the correlations of these lines are fairly strong out to hundreds of km / s , indicating that absorption is mainly occuring in filaments .",
    "finally , with the stated assumptions , the line correlation strength does not increase significantly with redshift in comparison with that of .    at present",
    "there are insufficient numbers of absorbers observed to test these simulation predictions .",
    "upcoming observations with cos may alleviate this situation , though issues of blending with and uncertainties in ionization conditions will make interpretation difficult . in principle , a similar analysis could be applied to absorbers ; while not shown for lack of space , also shows very little evolution in correlation strength ( assuming an increasing metallicity with time ) , and even stronger correlations than at all redshifts .",
    "we have investigated various line - of - sight autocorrelation measures for weak and absorption in the igm .",
    "correlations can in principle associate a given optical depth or column density with underlying physical densities within a hierarchical framework , thereby constraining the  bias \" of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "unfortunately , the increasingly complex physics associated with the low - redshift igm make this untenable at present .",
    "nevertheless , predictions of line correlations from hydrodynamic simulations broadly agree with observations , showing a growing correlation strength with time at fixed a fixed column density , and significant correlations out to @xmath41  km / s for strong lines at @xmath42 .",
    "more careful comparisons and improved observations will be needed to quantitatively assess any discrepancies , but for now it appears that the bias evolution model forwarded by structure formation scenarios for the ly@xmath0  forest is in agreement with observations .    1 cen , r. , phelps , s. , miralda - escud , j. , & ostriker , j. p. 1998 , apj , 496 , 577 + cen , r. & ostriker , j. p. 1999 , apj 514 , 1 + cen , r. tripp , t. m. , ostriker , j. p. , & jenkins , e. b. 2001 , apj , 559 , l5 + chen , x. , weinberg , d. h. , katz , n. , & dav , r. 2002 , apj , accepted + croft , r. a. c. , weinberg , d. h. , katz , n. , & hernquist , l. 1998 , apj , 495 , 44 + dav , r. , hernquist , l. , weinberg , d. h. , & katz , n. 1997 , apj , 477 , 21 + dav , r. , hernquist , l. , katz , n. , & weinberg , d. h. 1999 , apj , 511 , 521 + dav , r. et al .",
