    "micron - scale fluid - phase lipid - bilayer vesicles have been observed in recent years under controlled laboratory conditions @xcite to exhibit many amusing and diverse shapes . at the same time",
    ", there is now a one - parameter theory of vesicle shapes , the so - called area - difference - elasticity ( ade ) model @xcite , which appears to be qualitatively consistent with available experimental observations .",
    "it would be nice , however , to have a vesicle with an accurately measured shape and known parameters , to plug these parameters into the theory , to predict a shape , and to compare with the measured one .",
    "up to this time , this has not been possible , and , indeed , there have been few ( if any ) direct quantitative confrontations between theory and experiment .",
    "the reasons for this unsatisfactory state of affairs have their origins in both theory and experiment . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the principal models which have been proposed to describe vesicle shapes @xcite all have in common the same catalogue of stationary - energy shapes .",
    "thus , simple observation of a vesicle whose shape can be found in the catalogue , while evidence for the general validity of bending - energy models , does not distinguish one variant from another . in order to test the model ,",
    "it is necessary to study more indirect and/or delicate issues such as stability ( absolute and relative ) or shape - change systematics under variation of control parameters .",
    "this has not often been done @xcite for fundamental experimental reasons : first , there are two important vesicle parameters which can be modified systematically in the lab but are not subject to direct measurement",
    ". one of these is the spontaneous curvature , @xmath0 , which measures the preferred radius of curvature of the relaxed bilayer , based on the different lipid composition of the two constituent monolayer leaves and/or the different aqueous environments inside and outside the vesicle .",
    "this parameter is presumably the same for all vesicles in a single homogeneous suspension .",
    "the other is the relaxed area difference , @xmath1 , between the two leaves , based on the different number of lipid molecules which they contain @xcite and the long relaxation time for lipid exchange between them @xcite .",
    "this parameter will in general vary from one vesicle to another in the same suspension , based on the ( unknown ) manner in which vesicle closure occured during preparation and on any interleaf `` flip - flop '' or intercalation events which may have occured subsequently .",
    "in addition , the vesicle shape , itself , is a significantly ambiguous quantity . at laboratory temperatures ,",
    "all nonspherical vesicles undergo significant and unavoidable thermal fluctuations .",
    "thus , at any nonzero temperature @xmath2 , experiment must characterize a thermal shape ensemble .",
    "a single `` snapshot , '' such as has often been exhibited in the previous literature , can not do this .",
    "finally , experiments have not in practice probed the full , three - dimensional vesicle shape but at best a two - dimensional cut through it at the focal plane of the observing apparatus .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to show how to deal with all these problems in a serious manner for the first time .",
    "using video phase contrast microscopy , we recorded for each vesicle and at each temperature long time - sequences of two - dimensional vesicle contours .",
    "we parameterized these images in terms of a set of shape amplitudes .",
    "we used the shape - amplitude time - sequences to construct a thermal ensemble , from which we extracted a set of thermal expectation values . using this data",
    ", we show below how to associate each vesicle with a particular point in the phase diagram . in principle , information is left over after the mapping , so that a nontrivial confrontation between theory and experiment is possible . in practice , available resolution limits what we can do ; nevertheless , nontrivial checks are possible .",
    "overall , the results are encouraging .",
    "the vesicles that we have located in ( `` mapped into '' ) the theoretical phase diagram do , generally , end up in regions where they are predicted to be locally stable and to have low energies .",
    "furthermore , observed thermal trajectories exhibit shape instability close to ( if not always exactly at ) positions predicted by the theory .",
    "finally , after the instability the shape is in reasonable agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "gravitational effects play an important role experimentally . in order to record long time - sequences of vesicle shapes , it is convenient to adjust the density of the exterior solution so that the vesicles have a small negative buoyancy and collect at the floor of the experimental cell , where they remain within the focal plane of the microscope for long periods .",
    "in addition , gravity orients the long axis of vesicles of prolate shape so that it stays in or near the focal plane .",
    "these are practical issues . on the conceptual side , whenever it has non - neutral buoyancy , a vesicle is subject to gravitational shape deformations .",
    "the importance of these deformations has only recently been recognized @xcite and was not considered in the analysis of earlier experiments . in this paper , we first perform the full analysis without including gravity . then , we devote a separate section to the consideration of gravitational corrections .",
    "the upshot is that gravitational effects can be significant ; however , in the region of the phase diagram upon which we focus attention , there is no change in the qualitatively good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : section  [ background ] introduces the theoretical background necessary to analyse the experiments .",
    "section  [ techniques ] describes the experimental procedures .",
    "section  [ shapecontours ] explains how the analysis of the experimental shape contours was carried out .",
    "section  [ results ] sets forth our results using a pure ade mapping and ignoring gravitational effects . finally , in section  [ gravity ]",
    ", we explore the effects of gravity .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] provides a final assessment and summary .",
    "in order to have a language for discussing the experiments , it will be useful to present here a summary of some principal features of the ade model .",
    "additional material is available elsewhere @xcite . at mesoscopic length scales , larger than molecular sizes but smaller than the persistence length ,",
    "the shape @xmath3 of a fluid - bilayer vesicle is controlled by an energy functional @xmath4 $ ] consisting of two parts . the first , due to helfrich @xcite , measures the overall bending energy and",
    "is scaled by the bending modulus @xmath5 .",
    "the second requires a brief explanation : assuming fixed bilayer separation , @xmath6 , the actual area difference between the two leaves of the bilayer is @xmath7=2d\\oint da h({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the local mean curvature at the point @xmath9 of the vesicle surface and the integral runs over the ( closed ) vesicle surface . on the other hand , the preferred or relaxed area difference , @xmath10 of the two leaves",

    "the relaxed area @xmath12 per lipid molecule is a material parameter but can depend , of course , on the temperature @xmath2 .",
    "once the vesicle has closed , @xmath13 can only change due to lipid flip - flop between the two leaves and/or lipid interchange with the aqueous environment of the vesicle , processes which are believed to be slow on the timescale of the mechanical shape changes we shall be discussing @xcite . the second contribution to @xmath4 $ ]",
    "measures the elastic energy necessary to force @xmath14 $ ] to differ from @xmath13 , when the vesicle assumes the shape @xmath3 . because the vesicle is fluid , this ( local ) elastic strain is distributed uniformly over the vesicle surface and appears as an apparently nonlocal term controlled by a so - called nonlocal bending modulus @xmath15 .",
    "the moduli @xmath5 and @xmath15 are both of order @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the area stretching modulus of the bilayer @xcite , so the ratio , @xmath18 is generically of order unity .",

    "in addition , be locally stable to small shape perturbations @xcite .",
    "the lowest - energy branch ( which must , of course , be stable ) defines the ground state and should , in principle , be observed at sufficiently long times when the temperature is low .",
    "however , when energy barriers are large on the scale of @xmath42 , other low - lying locally stable branches may remain metastable for long periods . for sopc , @xmath43 @xcite , so metastability is expected to be common .    finally , we shall need below an important connection between the ade - model shapes and those of the so - called spontaneous curvature ( sc ) model@xcite , defined by the energy functional , @xmath44= \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\oint da(2h-\\bar { c_{0}})^2=\\kappa \\bigl(g[s]-2\\bar { c_0}m[s]+{\\rm const.}\\bigr ) , \\label{scmodel}\\ ] ] which describes a model without differential area elasticity and having a spontaneous curvature @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the corresponding reduced spontaneous curvature ) .",

    "( [ effectivecurvature ] ) , which we shall henceforth refer to as the effective reduced spontaneous curvature for the ade shape @xmath48 .",
    "notice that the control parameters enter the variational shape equation ( [ variation ] ) entirely via the coefficient of the second term .",
    "it follows that the stationary shape @xmath48 is specified completely and in a way that is independent of @xmath22 by giving @xmath38 and @xmath46 . for this reason , it will sometimes be convenient in what follows to think of the stationary shapes as @xmath49 rather than as @xmath40 , which still depends implicitly on @xmath22 .",
    "the variation ( [ variation ] ) may be thought of as proceeding in two steps : first make @xmath50 $ ] stationary at fixed @xmath51 , thus defining a function @xmath52 , then subsequently carry out the variation with respect to @xmath51 .",

    "this phase diagram , which depends on @xmath22 , can now be constructed rather easily numerically , at least , for @xmath38 not too small and when @xmath56 is not too far from unity @xcite .",
    "the experiments described in this paper deal with a branch of axisymmetric shapes , called `` prolates , '' because they have up / down symmetry and resemble prolate ellipses when they have reduced volume not too much below unity .",
    "the region of the ade phase diagram in which these prolates appear is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] .",
    "it is bounded below by oblate axisymmetric shapes and by a region of non - axisymmetric shapes , which need not concern us further here @xcite . above the prolates",
    "lies a region of pear shapes , for which axisymmetry remains but the up / down symmetry has been broken .",
    "this pear region is , in turn , bounded above by a line @xmath57 of fully `` vesiculated '' limiting shapes , consisting of two spheres joined by a narrow neck .",
    "the region above @xmath57 is incompletely explored but believed to be dominated by additional interconnected vesiculated shapes .",
    "the boundary between the prolates and pears at relatively high reduced volume involves a discontinuous shape change ( corresponding to a simple crossing of the energy branches @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) along the line @xmath60 but a continuous shape change ( corresponding to a bifurcation of @xmath58 away from @xmath59 ) along the line labeled @xmath61 , for lower reduced volumes beyond the tricritical point @xmath2 .",
    "both transitions are often called `` budding . ''",
    "it is important to emphasize that the prolate shape branch continues to exist outside of the `` prolate region '' of the phase diagram . indeed , within the context of the ade model and in the region of reduced volume shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] , a stationary prolate shape exists for every value of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "these shapes can only be observed , of course , when they are locally stable .",
    "the region of _ local _ prolate stability includes the `` prolate region '' of the phase diagram but extends beyond it into metastable regions , where the true ground state has some other shape .",
    "it is a crucial test of the theory that prolate shapes observed in the lab should , indeed , map to the region of predicted prolate ( local ) stability .",
    "metastability boundaries are marked by the first appearance of a soft mode , i.e. , a family of fluctuations which lower the overall energy . the region of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] within which prolates are predicted by the ade model to be locally stable is bounded above by the line @xmath62 and below by the line @xmath63 .",
    "these lines are calculated by an analysis of constrained gaussian fluctuations about the calculated stationary shape @xcite .",
    "the subscripts label the rotation mode @xmath64 and ( even / odd ) parity of the sector where the first instability occurs .",
    "it is an important result of this theory @xcite that instabilities in sectors which break the symmetry are a property of the shape @xmath48 alone , while those in non - symmetry - breaking sectors depend in addition independently on @xmath22 . for the prolate shapes , the boundaries @xmath61 and @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] both reflect instability in the symmetry - breaking sector @xmath65 .",
    "these boundaries are , thus , independent of @xmath22 in a @xmath66 representation of the phase diagram , so , in the usual @xmath67 representation , they shift with @xmath22 according to @xmath68 + \\frac{2\\bar c_0}{\\alpha}. \\label{mmapping}\\ ] ] these lines of shape instability ( and not the actual shape ( phase ) boundaries ! ) are the experimentally relevant ( observable ) ones .    strictly speaking",
    ", the above picture holds only in the low - temperature limit , since for @xmath69 sharp phase boundaries do not exist , because the vesicle is a finite system with finite energy and always explores its full phase space .",
    "nevertheless , in practice , as long as the prolate branch remains locally stable and surrounded by energy barriers appreciably larger than @xmath42 , thermally fluctuating prolate shapes are readily seen in the lab . in the prolate region of the phase diagram , these fluctuating shapes constitute a true , stationary , equilibrium ensemble . in regions which are only metastable , the set of prolate shapes should be regarded as a restricted ensemble , which may , however , be quasi - stationary for appreciable periods of time . in practice",
    ", metastability is expected to break down slightly inside the boundaries @xmath70 , when the metastability barrier becomes comparable to @xmath42 .",
    "we review briefly here what is known theoretically about the @xmath54 stationary shapes @xmath71 for the relatively high reduced volumes which will be relevant for the experiments @xcite .",
    "prolate shapes are axisymmetric .",
    "therefore , they are completely described by the curve made by their intersection with any plane which includes the symmetry axis .",
    "this curve may be written in terms of an arclength @xmath72 which starts at the north pole ( @xmath73 ) and ends at the south pole ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we take the direction of the polar axis to be @xmath75 and the perpendicular direction to be @xmath76 . a representation which will be convenient for our purposes",

    "the first term on the right describes a semicircular arc , i.e. , a spherical vesicle shape .",
    "the coefficients @xmath82 parameterize deviations from the sphere . for shapes like prolates , which are up - down symmetric , the odd-@xmath83 coefficients vanish .",
    "we note as an aside that the coefficients @xmath82 can not be set independently , since closure of the curve at the south pole requires that @xmath84 this places a complicated nonlinear condition on the set @xmath85 , which for any real vesicle shape will automatically be satisfied .",
    "the stationary shapes of the prolate branch are given by the coefficients @xmath86 .",
    "it is clear that , when @xmath38 is near unity , the coefficients @xmath87 will all be small .",
    "it is a consequence of the stationarity condition ( [ variation ] ) that these non - vanishing coefficients have the structure of a well - defined hierarchy@xcite , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 are linear functions of @xmath46 with coefficients of order unity .",
    "these results follow from refs . @xcite and @xcite . it is a consequence of this structure that for @xmath38 near unity",

    "@xmath93 is independent of @xmath46 at lowest order , because this is the only contribution of order @xmath94 and is , therefore , entirely determined by the constraint on the reduced volume @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fish ] , which was calculated by solving numerically the variational equation ( [ variation ] ) , illustrates the dependence of @xmath95 on @xmath38 and @xmath46 for the prolate branch near @xmath96 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath97 the terms of order @xmath98 and higher have an appreciable effect .",
    "note that , except near the anomalous point@xcite @xmath99 , knowledge of @xmath95 and @xmath38 uniquely determines @xmath46 .",
    "this brings us , finally , to the issue of the `` mapping '' , i.e. , of associating an experimentally observed @xmath54 prolate vesicle shape with a point in the ade phase diagram , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] . knowing the vesicle shape means that we have direct experimental access to `` geometrical '' quantities such as @xmath38 and @xmath51 , through the shape coefficients @xmath100 .",
    "the abscissa , @xmath38 , of the phase diagram is geometrical ; however , the ordinate , @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ m0bar ] ) , encodes information about the initial area difference @xmath101 and the spontaneous curvature @xmath0 , which are neither geometric nor directly observable in any other way . the solution to this apparent impasse is to use @xmath102 and fig .",

    "this framework is still incomplete in three senses .",
    "first , what the experiment observes is not a single @xmath54 shape but an ensemble of thermally fluctuating shapes .",
    "second , the mapping as described above simply takes an experimental point and associates it in a one - to - one manner with a point in the theoretical phase diagram .",
    "it does not yet in any obvious way test the correspondence between theory and experiment .",
    "third , effects of gravity should be taken into account .",
    "we discuss these important points in secs .",
    "[ shapecontours ] , [ results ] , and [ gravity ] , respectively .",
    "but , before doing so , we turn to the experiments .",
    "for all experiments , vesicles were prepared from the common phospholipids 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine ( sopc ) or 1,2-dimyristoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine ( dmpc ) .",
    "these lipids have their main phase transitions at 5  and 23 , respectively @xcite .",
    "they were purchased in powder form ( avanti polar lipids , birmingham , al , usa ) and stored dissolved in chloroform : methanol ( 2:1 ) in special chemically inert glass vials ( fisher scientific ) below -15 .",
    "preparation was done using standard techniques @xcite : a few drops ( 30 @xmath110l ) of lipid solution ( 10 mg per ml chloroform : methanol ) are spread with a syringe needle on a roughened teflon disk . the solvent is evaporated in a vacuum chamber overnight . the disk with the dried lipid is placed in a glass beaker ( 50 ml ) and pre - hydrated with a stream of argon saturated with water vapor for about 20 minutes .",
    "then , the desired solution for vesicle swelling is added and the beaker is covered with parafilm and placed in the oven . to avoid heat shock , the solution and the beaker with the teflon disk are heated separately to the swelling temperature prior to incubation . swelling was done with 50 mmol sucrose solution at a temperature of 36 .",
    "successful vesicle development is indicated by whitish streaks in the swelling solution .",
    "these streaks are collected into an eppendorf tube with cleaned glass pipettes and incubated at the swelling temperature .",
    "excess glucose solution ( 48 mmol ) is then added to obtain the desired density for the vesicles in the observation chamber .",
    "the end result of this procedure is a vesicle suspension with an interior sucrose solution and an exterior glucose solution ( with a slight admixture of sucrose ) .",
    "the excess density of the interior relative to the exterior sugar solution is approximately 3.3 g / l .",
    "this is needed in order that the vesicles sink gently to the bottom of the experimental cell , as discussed further below .",
    "vesicles were stored at the swelling temperature and used within a few days .      for observation ,",
    "vesicles are placed in a specially designed microchamber , tightly sealed with glass plates above and below to prevent evaporation @xcite .",
    "temperature is monitored by a thermocouple inserted into the observation chamber .",
    "a water bath , incorporated integrally into the chamber , provides temperature uniformity and control at the level of @xmath111 . because their density is slightly higher than that of the surrounding solution , the suspended vesicles fall to the bottom of the cell , where they rest gently against the lower plate and",
    "are observed from below via video phase - contrast microscopy .",
    "we use a standard inverted leitz microscope equipped with phase contrast ( leitz phaco 40/0.65 ) , capable of an overall magnification of 500 times and incorporating annular illumination and a phase ring .",
    "the light source was a hg arclamp powered by a high - voltage transformer .",
    "a permanent green filter and various grey filters were used to minimize degradation of the lipids .",
    "the video camera was positioned above the eye piece in such a way as to gain a resolution of 86 nm per pixel in a 480@xmath112480 frame .",
    "the visible phospholipid structures @xcite which collect at the bottom of the observation chamber in the microscope s focal plane are typically very diverse @xcite , including topologically complex and multilamellar structures , small vesicles included within larger ones , vesicles connected to one another by sub - microscopic tethers or tubes , vesicles with obvious adhesions , etc . for detailed observation",
    ", we try to select simple , topologically spherical , unilamellar structures , without identifiable microscopic connections or adhesions .",
    "in addition , we monitor the fluctuations of each candidate vesicle for some time prior to data acquisition in order to reject those with obviously `` abnormal '' behavior , e.g. , those exhibiting unexplainable asymmetry or sudden changes in apparent area or volume .",
    "the final fraction of usable vesicles is less than one percent",
    ".    images of selected vesicles are simultaneously displayed on the video monitor , saved to tape ( u - matic , sony ) , and processed in real time , as will be described in the next subsection . to sample at a fixed temperature a single thermal `` shape ensemble '' takes about 20 min . recording a thermal shape trajectory requires data at several different temperatures for the same vesicle .",
    "the chamber is allowed to equilibrate for at least 5 min .",
    "after each temperature change .",
    "temperature is recorded with a precision of @xmath111 .",
    "the total amount of data gathered consists of over 80 hours of video tape of more than 150 vesicles , including a wide range of shapes .",
    "budding is an ubiquitous process , which we observed at least 15 times in a _ controlled _ fashion .",
    "it is important to get long runs at each fixed temperature in order properly to sample the full thermal shape ensemble . on the other hand , thermal - trajectory runs which extend over",
    "more than a few hours appear to be contaminated by systematic drifts , presumably due to lipid degradation and/or flip - flop between bilayer leaves , which establishes intrinsic limits on sampling density and run time .    in this paper",
    "we restrict analysis to three particular sopc vesicles ( a , b , and c ) , which have in common that they started with prolate elliptical shapes and , on heating , eventually underwent budding transitions , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : seq95]-[fig : budding2 ] .",
    "qualitatively , other vesicles monitored behaved similarly , although they followed different trajectories , some exhibiting sharp shape transitions and others not .",
    "the reason for selecting the budding trajectories is that the location of the budding instability provides a particularly stringent test of the theory , as we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ results ] .      in order to analyse the data",
    ", it is necessary to reduce the video image to a time sequence of digitized shape contours .",
    "this was done by using a frame grabber ( matrox , dorval , quebec , canada ) to capture each image , computer processing the image in real time , storing the digitized contour point in memory , and then grabbing a new image .",
    "the image processing algorithm ( described below ) requires between 0.4 and 0.6 s ( depending on vesicle size ) on a pc with a 486 dx cpu and a 66 mhz clock speed .",
    "thus , for a video frequency of 30 frames / s , we are processing every 15th frame .",
    "this is relatively slow compared to processing times on the order of 0.1 s , which have been reported in the literature @xcite . however , in contrast to these fast procedures , our algorithm has a better - than - pixel accuracy in finding the contour @xcite .",
    "this high resolution turns out to be critical to the success of our experiments , since we shall need to resolve small changes in mean shape in tracking the thermal trajectory @xcite .",
    "in phase - contrast microscopy the image of the vesicle edge exhibits a `` halo , '' with a light band ( intensity maximum ) just outside the vesicle and a dark band ( intensity minimum ) just inside .",
    "typically , the intensity profile crosses the gray value of the local background at its steepest point , and we have taken this point to be the nominal position of the vesicle boundary @xcite .    the contour - digitizing algorithm is fully described in ref .",
    "the algorithm works on the ( integer ) pixel grid ( @xmath113 ) and requires initialization by hand to the vicinity of the outline of the particular vesicle to be studied ( there are ordinarily several vesicles in the field of view ) .",
    "suppose that a scan in @xmath114 at fixed @xmath115 intersects the halo . by averaging the grey values in the vicinity of the halo , we establish a local background intensity .",
    "the profile of intensity - versus-@xmath114 crosses this background value at a point @xmath116 ( generally non - integer ) which may be determined by linear interpolation . the point ( @xmath117 )",
    "is then stored as a contour point , and the algorithm steps @xmath118 and starts again .",
    "note that the interpolation procedure allows determination of the @xmath116 coordinate of the contour point with better - than - pixel precision .",
    "whenever the contour profile becomes steeper when scanned in the @xmath119 direction rather than in the @xmath116 direction , the algorithm automatically switches to scanning @xmath120 at fixed @xmath114 , and vice versa .",
    "each contour is terminated at closure .",
    "motion of the vesicle between successive frames is normally small enough so that each subsequent frame can be started where the earlier one terminated , so the initialization step needs to be carried out only at the beginning of each run @xcite .    the digitized contours exhibit noise at the pixel level ( 1 pixel=86 nm ) .",
    "this behavior presumably reflects the intrinsic noise of the original optical signal , the pixelation statistics , the digitization of the grey scale , and other factors . to remove some of this microscopic noise before data analysis",
    ", it is convenient to smooth the observed contours .",
    "this was done by applying a tenth - order binomial filter @xcite to the @xmath116 and @xmath119 contour coordinates , thus averaging over an effective width of about 5 pixels .",
    "the distribution of deviations of the original data points from the smoothed contour is gaussian with a typical full width at half maximum of about 0.7 pixels , thus giving an effective local lateral resolution of about 30 nm ( compared to a typical vesicle size of several microns ) .",
    "this resolution , well below the nominal optical resolution given by the wavelength of light , illustrates the delicate line - shape discrimination achievable via phase contrast @xcite and is more than adequate for quantifying the overall vesicle shape and the low - lying fluctuation modes .",
    "the result of this process is a time - sequence of several thousand digitized contours , illustrating the shape ensemble of each vesicle at each temperature .",
    "the relationship of these two - dimensional contours to the three - dimensional vesicle shape requires a brief discussion .",
    "the `` general wisdom '' seems to be that what is seen in phase contrast microscopy is a cut through the vesicle in the focal plane @xcite .",
    "however , this is an oversimplification .",
    "phase contrast is particularly sensitive to edges , so vesicle boundaries which `` overhang '' the focal plane ( relative to the optical axis ) may contribute to the image to a greater or lesser extent depending on the focal depth and the amplitude of the edge contrast .",
    "following the practice of the literature , we shall ignore such effects in what follows .",
    "we wish only to point out that there are substantive issues here which deserve to be addressed more fully in future work .",
    "in collecting data , the microscope is focussed on the maximal cross section of the vesicle under observation , and this focal plane does not change over time . for vesicles such as a , b , and c which are ( on the average ) prolate and axisymmetric , gravity tends to orient the symmetry axis horizontally , i.e. , to bring it into the focal plane .",
    "thus , the contours ( such as those based on figs .",
    "[ fig : seq95][fig : budding2 ] ) , which constitute our raw data , may be thought of as an ensemble of cuts through the mean symmetry axis of the fluctuating vesicle .",
    "fluctuations of the symmetry axis out of the horizontal plane modify this simple picture : if the focal plane no longer includes the symmetry axis , then the depth of focus and the edge enhancement mentioned in the previous paragraph probably give the resulting image the character of a projected outline of the tilted vesicle . in principle , this projected shape is different from a true axial section . in practice ,",
    "the stabilizing effect of gravity is large enough so that these out - of - plane fluctuation effects are almost always small ( except near the spinodal line of the budding transition ) , so we will treat the two - dimensional contours as if they represent axial sections . note that there is a balance here . in order to keep the theoretical analysis simple ,",
    "we would like to ignore the effects of gravity on the vesicle shape . on the other hand , in order to perform the experiment conveniently , we use gravity to localize the vesicle in the bottom of the chamber and to orient the symmetry axis ( of prolate vesicles ) to the horizontal plane ( see further discussion at the end of sec . [ results ] ) .",
    "this section describes how we parameterize the individual digitized two - dimensional shape contours discussed in sec .",
    "[ techniques ] , how we average the shape parameters over each thermal ensemble , and how we infer @xmath54 three - dimensional shape information from these averaged parameters .",
    "varying the temperature has two effects . on the one hand , it modifies , through ordinary thermal expansion , the temperature - dependent control parameters , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , as well as the material control parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath124 , and @xmath0 , which appear in the hamiltonian ( [ ade ] ) .",
    "these effects produce the so - called `` thermal trajectories , '' which we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ results ] . on the other hand , even if all these parameters were temperature independent , there would still be ordinary thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is for the moment these purely thermal fluctuations to which we direct our attention .",
    "there is , in principle , no way of taking a single fluctuating shape contour and inferring the corresponding @xmath54 shape . at best",
    ", we must take a full thermal shape ensemble and use theory to infer the @xmath54 shape of the vesicle _ with the same control parameters_. when the fluctuations are large , even this is beyond present theoretical capability .",
    "however , when fluctuations are small enough so that they may be treated at the gaussian level , progress can be made .",
    "the upshot of a recent study of gaussian fluctuations of vesicles of arbitrary axisymmetric shapes @xcite may be summarized as follows : any typical fluctuating shape may be regarded as a @xmath54 shape appropriately translated and rotated ( the so - called euclidean modes ) plus an area- and volume - conserving normal ( i.e. , perpendicular ) displacement @xmath125 at each point @xmath9 of the surface .",
    "it is a special feature of these fluctuations that ( because of the strict area and volume constraints ) both the average displacement @xmath126 and the mean - square fluctuations @xmath127 are generically of the order @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a typical static fluctuation - mode energy .",
    "note that the rms fluctuations are always larger than the shift when the fluctuations are small . in the analysis which follows",
    ", we shall assume that the gaussian regime holds and we shall ignore the mean shifts",
    ". ordinarily , the fluctuation - mode energies @xmath129 are of the order @xmath5 . for our vesicles",
    "@xmath130 , so for most regions of the phase diagram , this is an excellent approximation .",
    "there is , however , an important exception . at the instability boundaries ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedia ] ) one of the modes becomes soft .",
    "thus , near enough such boundaries , the gaussian treatment fails , and we may expect difficulties ( see sec . [ results ] ) .",
    "we interpret the measured two - dimensional contours as being sections which include the principal symmetry axis of the vesicle ( sec .",
    "[ videoimage ] ) .",
    "thus , in the spirit of the last paragraph and up to corrections which are normally of order @xmath131 , the center of mass is located in ( i.e. , near ) the focal plane at ( i.e. , near ) the point which is the center of mass of the digitized contour .",
    "we determine this point numerically for each contour .",
    "we then find the ( approximate ) principal ( long ) vesicle axis by calculating the two - dimensional moment - of - inertia tensor with respect to the center of mass and diagonalizing .",
    "this determines the ( nominal ) principal axis of each vesicle shape and identifies the north and south poles .",
    "we call the direction of the principal axis @xmath75 and the corresponding perpendicular direction @xmath76 ( which is , of course , not necessarily a principal axis of the three dimensional vesicle ) .",
    "thus , each experimental contour is reduced to a set of points @xmath132 . in what follows",
    ", we treat each half - contour separately ( each image has two half contours ) and take @xmath133 .",
    "it is convenient to represent each half - contour in the angle - arclength @xmath134 representation of sec .",

    "( @xmath140 is the number of digitized points in the half - contour . )",
    "note that the contours here are not up - down symmetric , so the odd - n coefficients do not in general vanish , as they did for the @xmath54 prolate shapes .",
    "similarly , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are normally nonzero .      for each half - contour of each video image , we calculate the shape coefficients @xmath143 plus the nominal ( `` effective '' ) vesicle area and volume , @xmath144 and @xmath145 in a similar spirit , we compute an effective reduced volume , @xmath146 for axisymmetric vesicle shapes , these equations would calculate the true area , volume , and reduced volume , respectively . since each image is only a snapshot of a section through a fluctuating vesicle",
    ", @xmath147 is only approximately equal to the true reduced volume @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath147 fluctuates in time for successive images of a given vesicle at a fixed temperature , while @xmath38 is in principle constant , since the true area and volume are conserved during the shape fluctuation .",
    "the several thousand images which constitute a typical experimental run with a given vesicle at a fixed temperature lead to characteristic time series for the quantities @xmath148 and @xmath147 , as illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig : tseries1 ] and [ fig : tseries2 ] .",
    "although the series are noisy , we expect to see memory effects between successive images , as long as there are any characteristic physical relaxation times longer than the 0.5 s between successive grabbed images .",
    "we have estimated elsewhere @xcite the typical relaxation times expected for these vesicles .",
    "away from instabilities , the characteristic times are expected to be at most several seconds , which is consistent with direct visual observations of the optical image . as the vesicle approaches an instability ( which occured at @xmath149 for vesicle a )",

    "this tendency is clearly visible when comparing figs .",

    "indeed , the distribution functions @xmath154 , @xmath155 , etc . ,",
    "are typically gaussian form in shape @xcite . in order to proceed with the mapping",
    ", we now need a procedure for inferring the zero - temperature quantities @xmath38 and @xmath156 from the thermal data .",
    "we do this in the crudest way , by simply making the identifications , @xmath157 as explained above ( sec.[fluctuations ] ) , the justification for these identifications is that the averaging process suppresses the rms fluctuations , which are of order @xmath158 .",
    "this leaves the thermal shifts plus the terms of order @xmath159 , both of which scale as @xmath128 , which we ignore in first approximation@xcite .",
    "these values of @xmath38 and @xmath95 allow us ( sec . [ mapping ] ) to infer @xmath46 ( and , thereby , @xmath34 ) from fig .",
    "[ fig : fish ] , and , thus , to complete the mapping .",
    "it is hard to give any meaningful estimate of the real uncertainty in the derived quantities @xmath38 and @xmath160 . for a truly stationary ensemble",
    ", the purely statistical ( sampling ) uncertainties in the average quantities should decrease as the ensemble sampling becomes denser . in practice ,",
    "our runs are necessarily of finite length ( sec .",
    "[ setup ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we divide the data set into two parts , corresponding to earlier and later times , we typically see a spread of values corresponding typically to @xmath161 for @xmath38 and @xmath162 for the @xmath82 s ( and somewhat larger near the budding instability ) . it is this measure which we adopt as an estimate of the statistical uncertainties",
    "of course , there are also systematic errors , such as the thermal shifts ( which we have neglected ) , the failure of the gaussian picture ( where fluctuations are large ) , the sampling error ( when the relaxation times are long ) , the fluctuations of the major axis out of the focal plane , and the effects of gravity ( sec . [ gravity ] ) .",
    "the upshot is that well away from the instability boundary the statistical uncertainties are probably realistic , except for the systematic influence of gravitational effects .",
    "near the instabilities , the situation is less well defined .",

    "[ fig : budding ] and  [ fig : budding2 ] ) , i.e. , the vesicle suddenly necked down and , over a time interval of @xmath164 seconds , developed a small quasispherical satellite .",

    "we emphasize again ( see sec .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) that the shapes mapped by fig .",
    "[ fig : fish ] are variationally stationary ( by construction ) but _ not _ necessarily locally stable , so that an arbitrary shape could end up anywhere in the phase diagram .",
    "it is worth pointing out that fact that the values of @xmath46 derived from the data points are all of order unity ( as expected on the basis of the theory ) is also an important test .",

    "indeed , in a certain sense , our ability reliably to distinguish shape changes corresponding to differences of order unity in @xmath46 is , in itself , surprising .",
    "consider that , for a vesicle of radius 10 @xmath110 m at a reduced volume @xmath179 , a difference in @xmath46 of @xmath180 corresponds to a change in shape which modifies the pole - to - pole contour length @xmath181 by only 20 nm .",
    "this number ( the smallness of which is a direct consequence of the hierarchy ) is below the _ local _ lateral resolution of the contour .",
    "how is this possible ?",
    "first , one has to realize that one does not measure a single distance only .",
    "rather , the amplitudes are calculated _ globally _ from an integral ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ : expamp ] ) ) over about 600 contour points , each of which deviates from the reference shape .",
    "second , one is interested in a low mode , which is insensitive to local perturbations in the membrane . and , third",
    ", the amplitudes are averaged over typically several thousand contours , giving an effective sample size on the order of @xmath182 .",
    "thus , shape differences on the @xmath183 nm scale are detectable @xcite .",
    "the `` thermal trajectories '' corresponding to each vesicle encode the effect of the experimental control parameter ( temperature ) on the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath46 ( or @xmath34 ) , defined in sec .",
    "[ ademodel ] .",
    "these quantities , in turn , depend on the volume @xmath24 , area @xmath23 , relaxed area difference @xmath1 of the vesicle , on the thickness @xmath6 and spontaneous curvature @xmath0 of the membrane , and on the ratio @xmath22 of elastic constants .",
    "all these quantities are in principle temperature dependent , and , if these dependences were known , we could calculate the thermal trajectory and compare with that found in figs .  [",
    "fig : cmap ] and  [ fig : mmap ] .",
    "the volume thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath184/k for water ) is known to be small compared to the area thermal expansion coefficient ( @xmath185/k for sopc@xcite ) .",
    "it is also known @xcite that the total bilayer volume @xmath186 is only weakly temperature dependent .",
    "a simple model is to assume that only @xmath23 and @xmath6 are temperature dependent .",
    "when @xmath187 , as is reasonable for a symmetric bilayer , this assumption leads to the simple result that the product @xmath188 is temperature independent@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis predicts trajectories of the general shape and scale shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cmap ] and  [ fig : mmap ] but significantly less steep than those observed .",
    "it is not hard to make more refined models consistent with the data , for example , by using a non - zero spontaneous curvature @xmath0 and/or a differential thermal expansion for the two leaves of the bilayer @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , direct measurements of these quantities are not available , so no useful conclusions can be drawn at this stage .",
    "another set of evidence bearing on the consistency of the observations with the theory is the relative size and shape of the main vesicle and the bud which forms at the instability . at the crudest level",
    ", theory predicts that the final state after budding will be pear shaped ( rather than fully vesiculated , with a microscopically narrow neck ) when the budding occurs for reduced volumes less than @xmath189 , where the spinodal crosses the limiting - pear line @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasedia ] ) .",
    "as @xmath22 increases , this crossing point moves to higher values of @xmath38 , so the observation that vesicle a buds to a fully vesiculated state would be inconsistent with a value of @xmath22 larger than 1.4 .",
    "this observation places an upper bound on @xmath22 .",
    "another qualitative prediction is that the ratio @xmath190 of the bud radius to the radius of the remaining main vesicle should increase as the reduced volume at budding decreases .",
    "thus , @xmath190 should be largest for vesicle a and smallest for vesicle c , as is , indeed , observed . on the other hand , on the limiting line @xmath57 ,",
    "the vesiculated configuration consists of two spheres , so there is a simple relation between the ratio @xmath190 and reduced volume @xmath38 @xcite",
    ". in particular , close examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : budding ] provides a value of @xmath190 close to 2.8 ( pure geometry , since the shape is very close to being two spheres ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath191 .",
    "indeed , budding is observed at @xmath192 for vesicle a.    overall , the agreement of theory and experiment is reasonable with the exception of the last point of the thermal trajectory of vesicle a , which lies distinctly above the theoretical spinodal boundary @xmath70 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : cmap ] and  [ fig : mmap ] ) .",
    "this last point is worrying .",
    "indeed , even below the spinodal line , there should be a ( fuzzy ) unstable region where the energy barrier out of the metastable state is of order @xmath42 .",
    "( the fact that vesicles b and c appear to bud increasingly below @xmath70 for higher reduced volume suggests that there may be some systematic effect at work which is distorting the locus of instability . )",
    "we have considered three possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first , our identification ( [ equ : ident ] ) involves the assumptions that ( a ) the fluctuations are small enough to be treated at the gaussian level and ( b ) the ( gaussian ) thermal shifts and rms fluctuations ( of order @xmath128 ) can be neglected . at the spinodal , fluctuations diverge@xcite , so neither of these assumptions is valid , and the identification ( [ equ : ident ] ) is expected to fail .",
    "it is entirely plausible that these assumptions are already breaking down near the spinodal , at the last stable point . because the effects of fluctuations beyond the gaussian level have yet to be calculated , we can not at this stage assess the impact that such corrections might have on the near - spinodal points of trajectory a    second , we have assumed that the major prolate axis is ( effectively ) in the focal plane of the microscope .",
    "if this axis is appreciably out of the focal plane , then the digitized images can not be thought of as sampling axial sections of the three - dimensional fluctuating shape , and the whole analysis of these images would have to be redone .",
    "as long as fluctuations are small , it is reasonable to assume that gravity acts to keep the prolate axis aligned .",
    "but , near the spinodal line , there are large , slow pear - like fluctuations@xcite , which are not `` up - down '' symmetric ( i.e. , which break the symmetry between the north and south poles ) .",
    "in this situation , gravity may be expected to systematically re - orient the small end of the pear towards the bottom of the chamber , thus tipping the effective symmetry axis away from the horizontal .",
    "once tipped , the symmetry axis is inhibited by gravity from returning to the horizontal , so one expects long intervals of asymmetric , pear - like data to appear in the near - spinodal time - sequences .",
    "in fact , the data for the last point of the vesicle a trajectory do show an `` anomalous '' cluster of frames with simultaneously large @xmath193 and @xmath102 , and these frames exhibit a fuzzy contour profile near the small end of the pear , indicating an overhang of the vesicle membrane beyond the focal plane .",
    "the effect of excluding this segment of the time - sequence is to lower @xmath169 nearly to the spinodal , thereby improving agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "finally , we have so far treated the effect of gravity as only something which positions the vesicles at the bottom of the chamber and aligns ( prolate ) axes in the horizontal plane .",
    "in fact , it will also modify the zero - gravity shape analysis which has been up to this point the basis of our mapping procedure .",
    "what effect do gravitational shape changes have on the analysis and can they explain the observed discrepancies ? this is the subject of the next section .",
    "when the density of the solution which fills the vesicle interior is greater than that of the exterior solvent , the vesicle will fall to the bottom of the container and , once in contact with the bottom , will deform in such a way as to decrease the gravitational potential energy of the interior , higher - density material .",
    "the overall shape involves a balance between the previous bending energy ( [ ade ] ) and a new gravitational energy , @xmath194 =   g_0 \\delta \\rho \\int z\\,dv\\ , ,    \\label{free_en}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 is the local acceleration due to gravity , @xmath196 is the excess mass density of the interior solution , @xmath197 measures height above the bottom of the chamber , and the integral is over the interior volume of the vesicle .",
    "the ratio of the energy scale @xmath198 of this gravitational term to the scale @xmath5 of the bending energy defines a dimensionless parameter , @xmath199 which measures the relative size of gravitational and bending energies@xcite .",
    "when @xmath200 is very small , we may expect shapes which are not significantly deformed relative to the gravity - free case .",
    "when @xmath200 is very large , gravitational energy dominates and vesicles will tend towards circular pancakes @xcite , squashed against the chamber bottom , insofar as constraints on area and volume allow .",
    "( of course , if @xmath96 , then the vesicle can only be spherical . )",
    "experimental values for our vesicles a , b , and c were nominally @xmath2012.2 , 0.3 , and 1.9 , respectively@xcite . here",
    ", we use a value of @xmath202 for our estimation @xcite .",
    "we may , thus , expect gravitational corrections to be appreciable for vesicles a and c but relatively less important for vesicle b. the qualitative effect of gravity on the mapping is not hard to see .",
    "roughly speaking , a `` pancake '' deformation will make the focal - plane section of a prolate rounder and larger in area than it would otherwise be .",
    "therefore , gravitational corrections will lead to larger values of @xmath147 .",
    "although the coefficients @xmath203 must approach zero for large g , it is not obvious where the asymptotic regime sets in , so the sign of the gravitational shift in @xmath102 can not be inferred a priori . in order to estimate these effects quantitatively , we need to be able to calculate vesicle shapes in the presence of gravity .",
    "the only previous calculation of vesicle shapes including gravitational effects was done by kraus et al .",
    "these authors found a gravity - induced prolate - oblate transition for values of @xmath200 similar to those encountered in our experiments . following this work , we use a polyhedral discretization of the vesicle surface and employ the program surface evolver @xcite to search iteratively for the shape - energy minimum .",
    "numerical minimization in the presence of a hard - wall constraint for the chamber floor leads to special problems in stability .",
    "for this reason , we replaced the hard wall by a soft substrate potential , @xmath204 , with @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "these parameters seem to provide a good compromise between numerical stability ( favored by a softer potential ) and a deformation of the shape caused by the soft tail of the potential which is as small as possible @xcite .",
    "constraints on area and volume are respected .",
    "the energy is minimized by moving the vertices in the direction of the energy gradient or , alternatively , by a conjugate gradient method .",
    "symmetries such as mirror planes can be exploited . for most of this work ,",
    "only a vertically - cut quarter section of the vesicle was actually computed .",
    "it turns out that the results for the final shape and energy are very sensitively dependent on the triangulation in a way that we can not completely control .",
    "we have tried to overcome this problem by fitting a linear interpolation to a grid of data points , as described in sec .",
    "vi b below .",
    "this procedure averages out random fluctuations from one point to another but can not address any subtle systematic dependence on grid size which might be hidden beneath the fluctuations ( we did check directly for such a grid - size effect , and none is apparent at the level of accuracy we can achieve ) . in the absence of a more reliable measure , we have simply used the deviation of the computed data points from the smoothed interpolation to give an estimate of the error introduced by the triangulation .",
    "finally , we point out that , not only does gravity influence the shape and energy of a vesicle at given @xmath38 and @xmath46 , but it also changes the relative energy of different shape branches , thus shifting phase boundaries and stability boundaries in the phase diagram . thus ,",
    "in looking for gravitational corrections to the experiments , we also need to compute the gravitationally shifted spinodal line @xmath70 .",
    "we have done this in the ( @xmath207 ) representation ( sec .",
    "[ ademodel ] ) for @xmath208 , in which now ( c.f . , eq.([curvature ] ) ) @xmath209 ) .\\ ] ] this involves two numerical fits to surface evolver data , first for the computation of @xmath210 and then for the derivative which evaluates @xmath211 . as a consequence , the quality of the results is rather poor . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmap ] , the result for our experiments is a shift of the upper spinodal upward in @xmath211 by about one unit ; but , the numerical uncertainties are unfortunately comparable in size to the shift .",
    "more detailed calculations would require finer triangulations and much longer relaxation times .",
    "since the computational investment is already appreciable and experimental uncertainties are already large near the spinodal , additional investment at this time does not seem wise . we did not compute the location of the full lower spinodal including gravity ; however , for @xmath212 ( and @xmath208 ) , we do know @xcite that the prolate - oblate transition occurs at @xmath213 ( as plotted ) , which also corresponds to a small upward shift .",
    "we estimated gravitational effects by running the surface evolver program for @xmath38 between 0.875 and 0.975 in steps of 0.025 and for @xmath46 between 2.5 and 10.0 in steps of 2.5 .",
    "for each pair of these parameters , we computed shapes over a range of small @xmath200 values . for each shape",
    ", we took a maximal horizontal section and computed effective values of @xmath147 , @xmath214 , and @xmath102 using formulas ( [ equ : expamp ] ) and ( [ equ : effvol ] ) .",
    "these values varied in a roughly linear way with @xmath200 , only with some superimposed fluctuations which we attributed to the triangulation sensitivity mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "we then assigned effective values of @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 for the gravitationally distorted shapes by making a straight - line fit to these computed points passing through the values previously computed for @xmath218 .",
    "for the values of @xmath200 , @xmath38 , and @xmath46 relevant to the experiments , the gravitational shift of @xmath102 is comparable to the numerical errors . on the other hand , the difference between @xmath215 and the actual reduced volume @xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : veff ] ) does lead to a noticeable correction in the values of @xmath46 inferred from the experimental data for vesicles a and c.    this family of lines may then be used to calculate gravitational corrections to the experimental data .",
    "since @xmath200 is known , it is only necessary to take the measured values of @xmath147 and @xmath102 , which belong ( presumably ) to shapes which are gravitationally distorted , and to infer the corresponding values of @xmath38 and @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : veff ] shows , for example , the calculated gravitational shift in the apparent volume , ( @xmath219 ) , at @xmath208 ( appropriate for vesicle a ) for representative values of @xmath38 and @xmath46 . note that the @xmath147 is always larger than @xmath38 , in agreement with the qualitative argument of sec .",
    "vi a , so that gravitational correction always shifts the data points to the left in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmap ] . the corrections increase for values of @xmath46 close to the prolate - oblate transition , i.e. , for small @xmath46 , where increasing the volume of a prolate vesicle at fixed @xmath46 leads eventually to a transition to an oblate shape with a vertical symmetry axis , thus producing a circular focal - plane section ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) .",
    "the behavior of the shift of the apparent volume near this prolate - oblate transition can be understood as follows : above the transition , for @xmath221 , the focal cut of the oblate vesicle is circular , independent of @xmath222 , i.e. , @xmath223 for @xmath224 , we find from geometry @xmath225 .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude @xmath214 is given by @xmath226 , where the coefficient @xmath227 depends on both @xmath228 and @xmath200 .",
    "thus , immediately below the transition , we have @xmath229 this equation implies that all the shifts in the apparent reduced volume for different @xmath46 meet the curve @xmath230 with a slope , @xmath231 , larger than @xmath232 . inspection of fig .  [",
    "fig : veff ] suggests that the slope is , in fact , positive for small @xmath46 .",
    "figures  [ fig : cmap ] and [ fig : mmap ] show the gravitationally corrected ( phase ) diagrams with the corrected data points for vesicles a and c. the uncertainties of the gravitationally corrected points include both the original experimental uncertainties and the numerical uncertainties of the gravitational shape - energy calculations .",
    "note that the data points are shifted to the left in @xmath38 , as expected qualitatively .",
    "all experimental points are in the ( metastable ) prolate phase , except the `` bad '' point which still remains above the upper spinodal , unless the `` anomalous '' cluster is removed , as discussed in the last section . accepting this somewhat ad hoc procedure",
    ", one may argue that this last stable point at @xmath233 lies within error bars inside the prolate phase after the gravitational corrections have been performed .",
    "we note , however , that the actual point of budding at @xmath234 , which must in principle be beneath the spinodal , would still appear to lie slightly in the unstable region , even after gravitational and tipping corrections .",
    "we may speculate that this apparent inconsistency is due to thermal shifts ( neglected so far in our treatment ) , which could be appreciable near the spinodal .",
    "so far , we have discussed stability of vesicle @xmath23 only with respect to the upper ( pear - mode ) spinodal . we have also checked that the data points of vesicle @xmath23 fall above the lower limit of stability of the prolates , which is an instability towards the oblate phase .",
    "in fact , the first point of vesicle @xmath23 is located ( including the gravity correction ) at @xmath235 . the location of the prolate - oblate transition at the same volume ( and @xmath208 )",
    "is known to occur at @xmath236 ( see the previous section ) , which is comfortably below our data point .",
    "thus , the vesicle - a trajectory does ( properly ) start in the stable - prolate region . on the other hand",
    ", this first point still appears somewhat out of line with the remaining three points of the trajectory ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mmap ] ) , which ( after gravity corrections ) fit quite well to the simple form @xcite , @xmath237 .",
    "we may speculate that thermal shifts play a role here , too , near the lower spinodal @xcite .",
    "a few comments are in order concerning gravitational corrections to the vesicle - c data .",
    "the reduced volume of vesicle @xmath238 is shifted to the left , as expected .",
    "unfortunately , the effective spontaneous curvature @xmath46 is not well determined , due to the large experimental and numerical errors .",
    "( we remind the reader that vesicle @xmath238 did bud at this location and , thus , exhibited large spinodal fluctuations . )",
    "this data point appears to be located appreciably below the spinodal line .",
    "this could be an artifact created by effects not included in the mapping ( see the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ results ] ) and/or it could be due to a low activation energy for budding near the sphere .",
    "the upshot of this exploration of gravitational corrections is that gravity does , indeed , have a substantial numerical effect , as might be anticipated from the fact that the dimensionless parameter @xmath200 is around @xmath239 for vesicles a and c. however , the qualitative ( and generally encouraging ) conclusions of the gravity - free analysis are not changed .",
    "previous experiments ( e.g. , ref @xcite ) have compared experiment with theory by , in effect , exhibiting a set of control parameters ( @xmath38 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath22 ) which lead to theoretical shapes similar to those observed in the laboratory .",
    "it is important that this exercise can be successfully carried through ; but , for various reasons , it constitutes far less than a full test of the theory .",
    "the first problem is that different variants of the theory , ranging from the sc model ( @xmath242 ) to the @xmath243 ( bilayer - couple ) model ( @xmath244 ) , all share the same set of stationary shapes , so that observation of a shape which can be suitably parameterized only distinguishes models in which the shape is stable from those in which it is not .",
    "one would like to be able to measure all the control parameters for a given vesicle and then to verify that a vesicle with those control parameters does , indeed , have the observed shape .",
    "the difficulty is that , while @xmath38 and @xmath22 are measurable , @xmath240 and @xmath241 ( which enter the shape problem in the combination @xmath34 ) are not .",
    "we have surmounted this problem by concentrating on the equivalent variable @xmath228 ( which incorporates @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath22 ) and inferring this variable directly from the shape data ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "although the inference process uses theory , there are nontrivial checks left over .",
    "local stability is still an important check , as we have argued . in particular ,",
    "the observed ( reasonable ) agreement of the experimental budding boundary with the calculated theoretical spinodal is encouraging , as is the qualitative agreement of the post - budding shape with that predicted by the theory .",
    "once the mapping is done , observation of other shape coefficients ( @xmath214 , @xmath245 , etc .",
    ", for the prolates ) provides , in principle , a further test of agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "unfortunately , at the level of precision we have been able to achieve here , @xmath214 is too weakly dependent on @xmath46 to be useful , and @xmath245 is too small .",
    "the second and in many ways more important advance which our experiment makes over previous ones is in the monitoring and analysis of the full thermal shape ensemble .",
    "previous workers have certainly observed the shape fluctuations ; however , shape comparisons between theory and experiment have heretofore relied on comparison of a single judiciously selected image with a theoretically calculated shape . when fluctuations are appreciable ( which they certainly become near any instability boundary ) , this process is clearly unacceptable .",
    "we have illustrated how to monitor and to analyse the full shape ensemble , and we have shown how to relate the ensemble data to the corresponding @xmath54 theoretical shapes , at least in situations where fluctuations are not too large .",
    "treatment of larger fluctuations , which are common near instabilities and will certainly be increasingly important at low @xmath38 ( where mechanical modes will tend to be softer ) , will require a new theoretical approach capable of going beyond the gaussian level .    finally , at a somewhat technical level , we have illustrated that the effects of gravity , which have been ignored in earlier work , are quantitatively important . and , we have shown how to adjust for them in comparing theory and experiment .    in summary ,",
    "our work provides in principle a quantitative test of the ade model of vesicle shapes .",
    "agreement between theory and experiment ( including suitable corrections ) is crude but satisfactory .",
    "it is important at this point ( and entirely feasible ) to carry out similar analyses in other parts of the phase diagram .",
    "when more precision becomes available in future experiments , more consistency checks will be possible ( e.g. , by looking at @xmath246 and @xmath165 ) , and it will be worthwhile to include in the analysis the corrections of order @xmath128 , which we have ignored herein .",
    "it is clear that gravitational corrections will have to be included and that non - gaussian effects will be important near instabilities .",
