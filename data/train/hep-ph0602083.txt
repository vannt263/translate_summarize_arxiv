    "<S> we propose a new explanation of the intriguing lsnd evidence for electron antineutrino appearance in terms of heavy ( mostly sterile ) neutrino decay via a coupling with a light scalar and light ( mostly active ) neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a fit to the lsnd data , as well as all relevant null - result experiments , taking into account the distortion of the spectrum due to decay . by requiring a coupling @xmath0 , a heavy neutrino mass @xmath1  kev and a mixing with muon neutrinos @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that this model explains all existing data evading constraints that disfavor standard ( 3 + 1 ) neutrino models .    </S>",
    "<S> the confirmation of the solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino oscillations by reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite experiments and the bounds from laboratory neutrino mass measurements  @xcite have set the `` standard '' neutrino picture in terms of three light active neutrinos with two mass square differences . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observed excess of @xmath3 in the lsnd experiment  @xcite was interpreted as evidence of @xmath4 transitions with a mass square splitting , @xmath5 , that can not be accommodated by the other two , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural solution would be to introduce a fourth neutrino  @xcite with the appropriate mass to give the hinted mass square difference . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not turn out to lead to a satisfactory description of all data in terms of neutrino oscillations  @xcite because of tight constraints from solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , and null - result short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments  @xcite . in view of this , during the last years , other alternative explanations have been proposed  @xcite . unlike in ref  @xcite where decay was invoked to evade sbl results , here we propose ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ) a new explanation of lsnd in terms of heavy ( mostly sterile ) neutrino decay . </S>",
    "<S> this new massive state , @xmath8 , must have a small mixing with the muon neutrino , @xmath9 , and the signal is explained by its decay into a combination of light neutrinos , being predominantly of electron type .    a natural way to introduce neutrino decay is by means of a term in the lagrangian , which couples neutrinos to a light scalar . </S>",
    "<S> we assume for the scalar mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the masses of three light neutrinos , of the scalar and of the new massive state , respectively . in this way the three light neutrinos are stable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the terms in the lagrangian which provide the decay are given , in the mass basis , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and , in general , the coupling matrix @xmath16 is complex .    in the case of majorana particles , neutrinos are identical to antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> weak interactions couple to left - handed ( chiral ) neutrinos and right - handed ( chiral ) antineutrinos while the propagation states are those of definite helicity . in the relativistic case , one can identify neutrinos and antineutrinos with helicity states up to terms of order @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ldec ] ) that not only the decay @xmath18 can occur , but also @xmath19 is possible  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the expected number of @xmath20 events with neutrino energy in the interval @xmath21 $ ] is given by  @xcite @xmath22\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the muon @xmath24 spectrum , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the differential probability that a neutrino of flavor @xmath27 with energy @xmath28 is converted into an neutrino of flavor @xmath29 with energy in the interval @xmath30 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the indexes @xmath31 take the value ` @xmath32 ' ( ` @xmath33 ' ) for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) . the detection cross section is given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 is an overall constant containing the number of target particles , efficiencies and geometrical factors .    </S>",
    "<S> unlike other explanations of the lsnd result based on sterile neutrinos , our model does not require mixing of the electron neutrino with the heavy mass state , so for simplicity we assume @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the differential probability for @xmath37 conversion can be written as  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the decay rate of @xmath8 as follows from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : ldec ] )  @xcite .     allowed regions for lsnd + karmen ( solid ) and sbl disappearance+atmospheric neutrino experiments ( dashed ) at 99%  cl , and their combination ( shaded regions ) at 90% and 99%  cl . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite.,width=207,height=170 ]     allowed regions for lsnd + karmen ( solid ) and sbl disappearance+atmospheric neutrino experiments ( dashed ) at 99%  cl , and their combination ( shaded regions ) at 90% and 99%  cl . from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite.,width=243,height=190 ]    our analysis of lsnd data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] ) , which does not use the much less significant decay in flight ( dif ) sample , gives a best fit value of @xmath40  dof for oscillations and @xmath41  dof for decay . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the slightly worse fit for decay is the spectral distortion implied by the energy distribution of the decay products . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the overall goodness of fit ( gof ) is still acceptable , 29% , giving as best fit values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .    as is well known , ( 3 + 1 ) neutrino models are disfavored due to the tension between lsnd and sbl experiments , which have not observed either appearance or dissapearance so far  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied their compatibility in the decay scenario . under the assumption @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , no @xmath20 disappearance is expected in sbl reactor experiments . however , since the explanation of the lsnd signal within this scenario requires mixing of @xmath46 with the heavy state , one expects some effect in @xmath46 disappearance experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the main constraints on the allowed lsnd - karmen region come from the cdhs experiment  @xcite and from atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the different expression for the @xmath46 survival probability in the decay scenario provides a rather poor sensitivity to @xmath9 , which comes via @xmath47 , unlike the case of oscillations , that it comes via @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : analysis ] , where appearance and disappearance experiments are shown to be in perfect agreement , with large overlap of the allowed regions .    mixing between active and sterile neutrinos , and couplings between active neutrinos and a light scalar , have been extensively studied , both in laboratory experiments and , for their implications in the evolution of the early universe and of supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of pions and kaons has been used to set bounds on the mixing of heavy neutrinos for masses above mev  @xcite . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> the most stringent bounds on the coupling from laboratory experiments , coming from light scalar emission in pion and kaon decays , are of order @xmath49  @xcite . on the other hand , a coupling @xmath50 would imply that @xmath8 and @xmath51 are strongly coupled to active neutrinos inside the supernova , and hence , they are trapped within the neutrinosphere , avoiding any energy loss due to particles escaping from the core . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the coupling would also imply that as soon as @xmath8 are produced in the early universe , they are thermalized along with the scalar , leading to 1.57 extra number of relativistic degrees of freedom at bbn .    in summary , we have presented an explanation of the lsnd evidence for @xmath20 appearance based on the decay of a heavy ( mostly sterile ) neutrino into a light scalar particle and light neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> it is needed @xmath2 and @xmath52 ev , and hence for @xmath50 , @xmath1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the decay model also predicts a detectable signal in the upcoming miniboone experiment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these results were obtained in collaboration with s. pascoli and t. schwetz . </S>",
