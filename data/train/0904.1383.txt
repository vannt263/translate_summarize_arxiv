    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) appear to be present in the nucleus of most , and perhaps all , nearby galaxies ( see , e.g. , reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the correlations between the masses of the smbhs and various global properties of the host galaxies suggest that evolution of smbhs is closely related to the evolution of galaxies .",
    "in particular , in hierarchical structure formation models , galaxies are built up by mergers between lower  mass progenitors .",
    "each merger event is expected to deliver the nuclear smbhs ( e.g. @xcite ) , along with a significant amount of gas @xcite , to the central regions of the new post  merger galaxy .",

    "@xcite has revealed a smbh binary at a separation of @xmath10kpc , and @xcite recently identified a candidate smbhb , at @xmath11 times smaller separation , from its optical spectrum .",
    "a radio galaxy is also known to have a double core with a projected separation of @xmath12 pc @xcite , and several other observations of radio galaxies , such as the wiggled shape of jets indicating precession ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x  shaped morphologies of radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the elliptical motion of the unresolved core of 3c66b @xcite below . ] have all been interpreted as indirect evidence for smbh binaries down to sub  pc scales .",
    "two interesting conclusions may be inferred from the above observations .",
    "first , while there is evidence for a handful of nuclear smbhbs , these objects appear to be rare .",
    "this suggests that if binaries do form frequently , then they coalesce ( or at least their orbital separation decays to undetectably small values ) in a small fraction of the hubble time .",
    "second , smbhbs can apparently produce bright emission , with a luminosity comparable to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , before they coalesce . in general , the circumbinary gas , delivered to the nucleus in galactic mergers ,",
    "can both play a catalyst role in driving rapid smbhb coalescence @xcite , and could also accrete onto one or both smbhs , accounting for bright emission during the orbital decay .",
    "the dense nuclear gas around the bh binary is expected to cool rapidly , and settle into a rotationally supported , circumbinary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical evolution of a smbhb embedded in such a thin disk has been studied in various idealized configurations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the generic conclusion of these studies is that initially , the orbital decay is relatively slow , and is dominated by viscous angular momentum exchange with the gas disk , whereas at small separations , the decay is much more rapid , and is eventually dominated by gravitational wave ( gw ) emission .    whether the decaying smbhbs produce bright electromagnetic ( em ) emission is comparatively much less",
    "well understood .",
    "if the disk is thin , the torques from the binary create a central cavity , nearly devoid of gas , within a region about twice the orbital separation ( for a nearly equal  mass binary , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a narrower gap around the orbit of the lower  mass bh in the case of unequal masses @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case , the lower  mass hole `` ushers '' the gas inward as its orbit decays , producing a prompt and luminous signal during coalescence . in the former case ,",
    "if the central cavity were indeed truly empty , no gas would reach the smbhbs , and bright emission could not be produced .",
    "however , numerical simulations suggest residual gas inflow into the cavity @xcite , which may plausibly accrete onto the bhs , producing non  negligible em emission .",
    "yr after the coalescence , caused by the gas outside the cavity falling in , after a delay set by the disk viscous time @xcite .",
    "such an afterglow is interesting , for example for a follow  up to smbh merger events detected by the _ laser interferometric space antenna ( lisa ) _ , but not relevant to the idea proposed in the present paper . ] finally , smbhbs recoil at the time of their coalescence due to the emission of gravitational waves @xcite",
    ". the gas disk will respond promptly ( on the local orbital timescale ) to such a kick , which may produce shocks , and transient em emission , after coalescence  @xcite .",
    "the kick , however , can begin building up during the late inspiral phase @xcite , possibly resulting in some emission even before the final coalescence . during the late stages of coalescence , emission may also be produced by viscous heating of the disk by the gws themselves @xcite .",
    "the luminosity , spectrum , and time  evolution of any em emission produced by coalescing smbhbs , especially during the last , gw  driven stages , remains uncertain .",
    "_ however , any emission produced during the inspiral stage is likely to be variable .",
    "_ for example , recent numerical simulations of an equal  mass binary on parsec scales @xcite , and of both equal and unequal  mass binaries on sub  parsec scales @xcite find that the circumbinary gas disk is perturbed into eccentric orbits by the rotating quadrupole potential of the binary , and that the rate of residual accretion across the edge of the cavity is modulated , tracking the orbital period .",
    "the luminosity is likely to be directly tied to the mass accretion rate , and therefore may vary periodically .",
    "however , even if the gas accretion rate were steady , one would expect periodic flux variations , due to the orbital motion of the binary ( kocsis & loeb , in preparation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question : _ given their expected rate of orbital decay , could the population of coalescing smbhbs be identified statistically in an observational survey for periodically variable sources ? _ given that the interpretation of individual smbhb candidates have so far remained ambiguous , with alternative explanations possible for each source , the potential for such a statistical identification should be explored .    to answer this question , we first utilize steady  state thin disk models to study the orbital decay of a smbhb , embedded in a circumbinary disk .",
    "the decay is described by the residence time @xmath14 the sources spend at each orbital radius @xmath15 , or at the corresponding orbital timescale @xmath16 . in the limiting case of a purely gw  driven evolution , which becomes valid at small orbital separations ( typically at @xmath17 several@xmath18 schwarzschild radii , but with large variations ; see below ) and remains valid until the final minutes of the merger ( the so  called `` plunge '' stage ) , the residence time is given by @xmath19 . at larger separations , the viscous interaction between the binary and the disk drives the binary evolution .",
    "the residence time in this regime becomes dependent on assumptions about the properties of the disk and the nature of the binary ",
    "disk interaction , which we will explore in this paper . in general , @xmath20 , with the generic value of @xmath21 well below @xmath22  significantly flatter than the @xmath23 relation in the gw  driven stage .",
    "we then hypothesize that ( i ) non  negligible emission ( at a fair fraction of the eddington luminosity ) is maintained throughout the orbital decay , and ( ii ) the luminosity varies periodically on the orbital time ",
    "the first assumption allows us to identify coalescing smbhbs with luminous quasars .",
    "the second assumption implies that as the orbit of a binary decays , its variability timescale decreases . among sources at redshift @xmath24 with",
    "similar inferred bh masses , the observed incidence rate @xmath25 of periodic variability on the time ",
    "scale @xmath26 , is then proportional to the residence time @xmath27 . at short periods",
    ", the @xmath25 could therefore show a characteristic power ",
    "law dependence on @xmath28 indicative of a gw  driven evolution , whereas at longer periods ( and , as we will discuss , for lower bh masses ) the dependence will be flatter , due to viscosity  driven evolution .",
    "we quantify the requirements that such periodically variable sources be identifiable , based on their incidence rate , in an optical or x  ray survey .",
    "luminosity variations at a fraction @xmath29 of the eddington luminosity would correspond to a periodically varying flux component with amplitude @xmath30 for bhbs at @xmath31 , or to @xmath32 $ ] magnitudes in the optical .",
    "we find that these periodic sources are either too faint or too rare to have been found in existing variability surveys .",
    "however , if the overall luminosity is indeed a non  negligible fraction of the binary s eddington luminosity , then a long  duration future survey , sensitive to periods of weeks to tens of weeks , could look for periodically variable sources , and identify a population of sources obeying well  defined scaling laws .",
    "the discovery of a population of such periodically variable sources could have several implications . at long periods and low bh masses ,",
    "the scaling index @xmath21 between the residence time and the period @xmath33 will probe the physics of the circumbinary accretion disk and viscous orbital decay . at shorter periods and higher masses ( roughly , at @xmath34 few weeks for @xmath35 ) , the identification of a @xmath36 power  law would confirm that the orbital decay is driven by gws .",
    "this would amount to an indirect , statistical detection of gw  driven smbhbs , independent of any direct detection of gws by _",
    "lisa_. this would also confirm that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is being perturbed by the bhs  and would thus serve as a proof of concept for finding _ lisa _ electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : diskmodels ] , we discuss the evolution of binaries with different masses and mass - ratios , embedded in a circumbinary gas disk .",
    "we describe simplified models for the disk and for the binary  disk interaction , and emphasize that the binaries probe the distinct physical regimes in the disk , before gws take over their evolution . in   [ sec : observations ] , we discuss the possibility of searching for a population of coalescing smbhbs among a catalog of luminous quasars , either based on their variability , or on shifts of their spectral lines .",
    "we discuss modest constraints available from existing surveys , and comment on specific recently detected individual smbhb candidates .",
    "we then quantify the requirements for a detection in a future survey . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we briefly summarize our results and offer our conclusions .",
    "when necessary in this paper , we adopt the background cosmological parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe the evolution of the orbital separation of a smbh binary . the basic picture",
    "we adopt is that the binary is embedded in a thin circumbinary disk , with the plane of the disk aligned with the binary s orbit @xcite .",
    "initially , the orbital decay is dominated by viscous angular momentum exchange with the gas disk . however , the time ",
    "scale for viscous decay decreases relatively slowly as the orbital separation @xmath15 decreases ( @xmath40 ; see below ) whereas the time  scale to decay due to gravitational radiation decreases steeply ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , generically , there exists a critical orbital radius @xmath42 , below which the decay is dominated by gravitational radiation .    to describe the evolution quantitatively ,",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions . the circumbinary gas is assumed to form a standard geometrically thin , optically thick , radiatively efficient , steady  state accretion disk @xcite . we assume zero eccentricity for both the binary and for",
    "the disk ( justified by @xcite , however see @xcite ) , and we assume co  planarity between the disk and the binary @xcite .",
    "all of these assumptions may fail in the late stages of the merger ( even before gw  driven decay begins ) . however , under these assumptions , the disk structure and the orbital decay have simple limiting power  law solutions , with the power",
    " law indices depending on the choice for the underlying physics . these solutions are useful to describe the possible evolution of the binary , and to illustrate the point that the decay rate is generically a different  much flatter ",
    "function of @xmath16 than the @xmath43 behavior in the gw  driven case .",
    "we emphasize that our aim here is not to provide accurate , self  consistent solutions for the co  evolution of the smbh binary and circumbinary disk .",

    "it is unclear whether abundant gas will indeed be present this close to the bhs , especially since during the late stages of the merger , the gas is evacuated from the inner disk by the binary s torques , and the exterior gas disk is eventually unable to follow the rapidly decaying bh binary .",
    "furthermore , in the final , gw  dominated regime ,",
    "the @xmath329 scaling strictly holds only if any residual circumbinary gas has negligible impact on the orbital decay .",
    "this requirement could , in fact , contradict the assumption that the binary is producing bright emission during this stage .",
    "second , in order for the emission to be periodically variable , the gas has to respond rapidly to the gravitational perturbations from the binary .",
    "scale for this response is of order the _ local _ orbital time ; variability on the orbital time ",
    "scale of the _ binary _ itself therefore again requires gas close to the binary s orbital radius .    if the central cavity were indeed truly empty , no gas would reach the smbhbs , and bright emission could not be produced . on the other hand ,",
    "an empty cavity is certainly an idealization , and detailed models for the joint disk + binary evolution are required to assess the plausibility of our assumptions .",
    "conversely , the observations envisioned here will constrain such models ( which , again , is the main point of the present paper ) .    in support of our assumptions , we note , however , that gas could be present near the bhs in the case of unequal masses ( so that the torques are reduced ) , or if the disk remains thick , making it difficult for the binary to open and maintain a nearly empty central cavity .",
    "numerical simulations indeed suggest residual gas inflow into the cavity @xcite , which may plausibly accrete onto the bhs ( with both bhs possibly forming their smaller individual accretion disks ; @xcite ) , producing non  negligible em emission .",
    "simulations have also shown , in the context of proto  planetary disks , that when the circumbinary disk is sufficiently thick , the mass flow rate across the gap is increased @xcite . such residual inflow onto a smbh binary",
    "has been invoked to explain the @xmath19212yr periodic emission from the quasar oj287 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the large velocity offsets seen in the spectrum of the quasar sdss  j092712.65 + 294344.0 @xcite have been interpreted with a similar model , including gas inflow onto a luminous smbh binary @xcite ; a similar interpretation was invoked for the binary quasar candidate recently identified by @xcite .",
    "there are additional caveats that will hamper the identification of any periodic sources , even if they exist and produce bright enough luminosity to be detectable .",
    "the eddington ratio of bright agn is already known to have a significant scatter ( @xmath330 dex ; @xcite ) .",
    "the light ",
    "curve of the merging binary is also likely to evolve , rather than having a simple `` tophat '' shape .",
    "it is possible , in particular ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) that merging smbhs spend a significantly longer time ( @xmath331 yr ) at lower luminosities , ( @xmath332 ) .",
    "this will complicate the interpretation of any observed variability ( i.e. , converting the observed ratio @xmath333 at @xmath322 to @xmath334 will require knowing the probability distribution of eddington ratios ) .",
    "this , however , can be alleviated by considering only the _ relative _ abundance of periodically variable objects at different values of @xmath322 , instead of the absolute number of sources that show periodic variability . in this case",
    ", the only assumption required is that @xmath318 does not evolve significantly during the observed range of @xmath322  this should be reasonable over a factor of a @xmath192 few range in orbital radius or in @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , even if there is a range of different bh masses , among sources with a similar luminosity , producing variability with the same period , figures  [ fig : tres_q1 ] and [ fig : tres_q0.01 ] show that more massive bhbs will move much more quickly through a fixed @xmath335 .",
    "given that there are most likely fewer of the more massive bhbs to begin with , the set of all sources with the same @xmath322 will be heavily dominated by the lowest  mass bhbs , caught at their relevant orbital radius .",
    "this still leaves the caveat , however , that the source is significantly sub  eddington during the late stages of coalescence . in this case",
    ", the periodic sources will be harder to detect both because they are fainter , and also because they will also be rarer ( among the long  lived and therefore more numerous , near ",
    "eddington quasars with a similar luminosity ) .",
    "another caveat is that at fixed @xmath16 and @xmath0 , the distribution of @xmath1 is unknown , and can depend on @xmath0 .",
    "however , bright agn activity is thought to be activated only in relatively major mergers .",
    "a smaller satellite galaxy , falling onto a larger central galaxy that is more than @xmath267 times more massive , may not experience the torques needed to bring its gaseous nucleus , with the low  mass bh , close to the center of the larger galaxy , for the bh - bh merger to take place @xcite ; the dynamical friction time for small galaxies themselves can also be too long ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or the small satellites can be tidally stripped before reaching the central regions of the larger galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these arguments , coupled with the well  established correlations between the mass of a smbh and its host galaxy ( e.g. @xcite , see also the introduction ) , suggest that the @xmath1distribution among binaries associated with quasars may not extend to values significantly below @xmath336 .",
    "finally , for simplicity , in our estimates we have assumed circular orbits , both for the binary and the disk gas .",
    "it has been shown that the binary ",
    "disk interaction could drive both the smbhs and the gas to have significant eccentricities @xcite .",
    "such eccentricities should leave characteristic asymmetric signatures in the modulated mass accretion rate ( see figure 8 in @xcite ) . the resulting light ",
    "curves may exhibit corresponding features , which could be resolved , given sufficient time  sampling . in practice , allowing for eccentricities will most likely further complicate the interpretation of any observed period distribution , especially if the time  sampling is too coarse to explicitly reveal any asymmetric features .      despite",
    "the caveats listed in the previous section , it is plausible that the periodic sources envisioned here exist , and we propose that they can be looked for , in a suitably designed survey .",
    "most importantly , figures  [ fig : tres_q1 ] and [ fig : tres_q0.01 ] show that the expected variability timescale can be in a suitable range for a statistical detection , with a duty  cycle of @xmath337 yr over the range from @xmath5day to @xmath192yr .",
    "this suggests that such periodic sources may not be too rare",
    ".    what will be the practical limitations for discovering the population of periodic sources ? clearly , there has to be a sufficient number of sources , observed over a range of variability time",
    " scales for a representative statistical sampling , and the brightness variations of these sources must be detectable .",
    "in addition , the individual light  curves have to be sampled well enough to confirm their periodic nature : this will be necessary to distinguish the coalescing smbh binaries from other types of variable objects .",
    "besides discovering the periodic sources , the idea proposed here is to measure the dependence of @xmath338 on @xmath322  possibly to use the @xmath339 scaling to demonstrate that the periodic variability comes from perturbations by the orbital motion during the gw inspiral . for this , the survey also needs to cover at least a factor of several range in @xmath322 .",
    "the above issues will place requirements on ( i ) the sensitivity and ( ii ) solid angle , as well as on the ( iii ) total duration and ( iv ) sampling rate for a survey .",
    "we can use the simple disk models and the idealized picture discussed above , to roughly delineate these requirements .",
    "for simplicity of discussion , let us assume that all sources are at @xmath31 .",
    "in reality , quasars ( and therefore major bh mergers ) have a broad distribution with a peak around this redshift ; clearly this will have to be taken into account in designing an actual survey .",
    "for simplicity , let us also fix the mass ratio @xmath220 .",
    "in reality , there should be a distribution of values , perhaps in the range @xmath340 , for the mergers that activate bright quasar activity @xcite .",
    "this would not significantly affect our conclusions , unless @xmath1 frequently extends well below 0.1 .",
    "imagine a survey with a sensitivity that corresponds to detecting the periodic variability of bhbs with a mass @xmath341 at @xmath31 , covering a solid angle @xmath342 .",
    "( a real survey , of course , will have a completeness for variability detection that is not a step function ) .",
    "let us assume that the variable flux corresponds to a fraction @xmath343 of the steady mean luminosity , @xmath344 .",
    "if the survey volume contains a total of @xmath325 smbhbs with the luminosity @xmath304 , then the periodic variable fraction , @xmath345 , can be determined down to the smallest value @xmath346 ( i.e. to find at least one periodic source ) . fixing the values of @xmath347 and @xmath348 ( as well as @xmath341 , @xmath24 and @xmath1 ) , this corresponds to a minimum variability time ",

    "for example , with the steepest possible ( pure gw  driven ) scaling @xmath339 , a survey volume containing a single source with @xmath353 weeks would then contain @xmath354 sources with a similar luminosity but with a @xmath355 week period .    to fix some numbers ,",

    "there is certainly a possibility that the periodic sources envisioned here do not exist ( e.g. , because the smbh binary does not produce bright and variable emission during its gw  emitting stage , at orbital separations of @xmath444 schwarzschild radii ) .",
    "nevertheless , we argued that existing surveys already approach the required combination of sky coverage and depth , and future surveys , designed to make observations for several years , with a sampling rate of a few days , could yield a positive detection and identify periodic source populations .",
    "this would bring rich scientific rewards , possibly including the indirect detection of gravitational waves , driving the orbital decay of these sources .",
