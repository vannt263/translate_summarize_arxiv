    "this assumption is not warranted especially when developping a new instrument at the state - of - the - art .",
    "the recent implementation of three csos in our lab was the opportunity to test the three - cornered - hat method @xcite to extract the individual adev .",

    "the thin lines are the adev computed from the data after a linear drift removing .",
    "the measured adevs are better than @xmath4 for @xmath29 s. if the oscillator noises are equivalent and uncorrelated , that means that the fractional frequency stability of one unit is better than @xmath30 , which is a conservative value as we will see in the next section .",
    "this number is coherent with the phase noise measurement between cso-2 and cso-3 shown in figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "this result corresponds to the phase noise of one unit assuming equivalent and uncorrelated the two csos : 3 db has been substracted from the measured spectrum . for fourier frequency @xmath31",
    "hz , the phase noise spectrum can be approximated by a white frequency noise ( @xmath32 slope ) and a flicker frequency noise ( @xmath33 slope ) :    @xmath34    this phase noise spectrum is equivalent in the time domain to an allan standard deviation such as @xcite : @xmath35    cso-1 and cso-3 present the best performances at short term , whereas a perturbation near @xmath36 s affects cso-2 . the long term behaviors also differ : cso-1 and cso-2 do not show a frequency drift but seems limited by a randow walk process . conversely cso-3 is drifting with a rate of @xmath37/day .",

    "at short term ( @xmath38 ) , all the individual adevs improve with the integration time but do not follow the expected @xmath39 slope . indeed it is expected that the cso short - term frequency stability is ultimatly limited by the pound discriminator white frequency noise . for cso-1 and cso-2 this white frequency noise is completely masked by another process leading to a hump in the adev . in section [ sec : reso - temp - variations ] we show this perturbation comes from the noise of the resonator temperature controller . at longer integration times ,",
    "the adevs reach an apparent flicker floor expanding over approximatly two decades .",
    "thus for the best oscillator , i.e. cso-1 , @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "+ the humps appearing in the three adev at @xmath42 s , can be attributed to an oscillation in the air conditionning system of the lab .",
    "thus they reveal the residual sensitivity to the room temperature of each cso",
    ". nevertheless the resulting cso frequency variations are obviously correlated , which is in conflict with the requirement of the three - cornered - hat method .",
    "the calculated adev near 400 s can not be considered as the actual frequency stability .",
    "correlated noises indeed induces false results : the inversed hump in the cso-1 adev is symptomatic of this situation . the same caution must be taken in the analysis of the long term fluctuations resulting also for a large part from the room temperature variations .",
    "the resonator is stabilized at its turnover temperature @xmath14 using a lakeshore model 340 temperature controller in the proportional - integral ( pi ) mode .",
    "the temperature sensor is a cernox type cx-1050 with a sensitivity of approximately @xmath43 k@xmath44k and the actuator is a @xmath45 heater .",
    "the lakeshore controller offers a variety of digital processing that can be done to the raw sensor data before applying the pi control equation .",
    "thus the input information can be in sensor unit ( @xmath46 ) or converted in temperature unit ( k ) . in this case",
    "a temperature response curve is needed to convert a sensor reading in sensor units to temperature .",
    "the configuration affects both the measurement resolution and the gain of the controller .",
    "the input data processing chosen , the setting of pi - controller gains is done using the autotuning procedure of the lakeshore controller .",

    "figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows the resonator temperature adev , i.e. @xmath49 , for different temperature controller configurations .",

    "the curve @xmath59 corresponds to the best configuration we found and that has been used for the measurements presented in the previous section .",
    "the curve @xmath59 is just above the resolution measurement limited by the frequency noise of cso-2 .",
    "the temperature modulation is still there leading to the hump in the cso-1 adev ( see figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) . in spite of all our efforts we did not manage to find a better tuning for cso-1 and cso-2 .",
    "cso-3 behaves better as no hump has been observed in its adev . + the cause of this temperature modulation as well as its impact on the cso frequency stability , are still not well understood . a modulation amplitude as @xmath60 k will lead to a frequency instability of @xmath0 if the resonator temperature is @xmath61 mk above or bellow its turnover value @xmath14 .",
    "such an error on the temperature setpoint seems not realistic as it is much higher than the controller measurement resolution of @xmath62k .",
    "moreover we tried to adjust the temperature setpoint by step of @xmath12 mk around the expected @xmath14 without finding any better tuning .",
    "the temperature modulation could result from an unexpected time lag in the thermal system making the control loop unstable .",
    "cso-1 and cso-2 are operating for a long time .",
    "they have been subjected to several stops , and both have been transported by car in the frame of the uliss project .",
    "thermal anchorages and bold tightenings into the cryostat could have been degraded by the resulting mechanical perturbations .",
    "that is coherent with the fact that cso-3 is immune to these thermal perturbation as it was recently assembled and has not been transported .",
    "as explained in the previous section , cso-3 is the only one not limited at short term by the resonator temperature fluctuations .",
    "its adev is shown in figure [ fig : fig8 ] for several values of the pound frequency discriminator gain @xmath21 .",
    "the latter has been simply varied by changing the power @xmath63 injected into the resonator , all the other parameters being kept constant .",

    "the cso short term fractional frequency stability is : @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( v@xmath70 ) is the demodulator output voltage spectral density .",

    "the direct measurement of @xmath69 requires to duplicate the pound detector and thus to place a second cryogenic diode receiving the signal reflected by the cavity .",
    "this has not been foreseen in our current cso design .",
    "however this value is compatible with the expected noise contributions of the lockin amplifier and of the diode detector itself .",
    "+ assuming an identical pound detector noise for cso-1 and cso-2 leads to a short term frequency stability of @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . for this two csos",
