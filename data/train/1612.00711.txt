    "the mose ( modelling eso sites ) project is a feasibility study whose principal goal is to prove the possibility to forecast all the most relevant classical atmospheric parameters for astronomical applications ( wind speed intensity and direction , temperature and relative humidity ) and the optical turbulence ( ot ) that means @xmath0 profiles with the integrated astroclimatic parameters derived from the @xmath0 ( i.e. seeing @xmath1 , isoplanatic angle @xmath2 and wavefront coherence time @xmath3 ) above the two european southern observatory ( eso ) sites of cerro paranal , the site of the very large telescope ( vlt ) and cerro armazones , the site of the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) . the ultimate goal of the project is to investigate the possibility to implement an automatic and operational system for the forecast of these parameters at the vlt and at the e - elt . in this paper",
    "we will treat the optical turbulence that , as will see later on , is the most difficult but also the most challenging parameter to be forecasted among those we treated . in previous papers related to the mose project we treated the abilities of the model in reconstructing wind speed and direction , temperature and relative humidity all along the atmosphere ( @xmath5 20 km i.e. vertical stratification of the atmospheric parameters ) @xcite and in reconstructing the same atmospheric parameters close to the surface @xcite . in all cases results indicated excellent model performances . in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on results we obtained on the analysis of the model performances in reconstructing the optical turbulence i.e. the astroclimatic parameters ( @xmath0 profiles , the seeing @xmath1 , the isoplanatic angle @xmath2 and the wavefront coherence time @xmath3 ) that are commonly used to optimized the observations supported by the adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "this paper completes therefore the whole feasibility study carried out for eso .",
    "the forecast of the optical turbulence is crucial for the success of the new generation telescopes .",
    "we refer the reader to the introduction of @xcite for a detailed description of the scientific challenges related to the forecast of the optical turbulence .",
    "we remind here the key elements .",
    "the traditional scheduling of scientific program using as a criterion only the quality of the scientific program has , indeed , important drawbacks and limitations .",
    "it has been widely accepted by the astronomical community that we had to take into account simultaneously the quality of the scientific program but also the status of the optical turbulence to optimize the use of the telescope otherwise we risk that the most challenging scientific programs are not carried out and the most important potentials of telescopes and instrumentation are not exploited as they could .",
    "the forecast of the ot is therefore extremely important to schedule the scientific programs , to select the typology of instruments to be used at a specific time of the night and to optimize the adaptive optics ( ao ) systems performances .",
    "the ao techniques can be very powerful , at present , in correcting the perturbations induced by the optical turbulence on the wavefronts but the ao performances are strongly dependent on the status of the optical turbulence and , under particular conditions , they can hardly run or they can even not run at all . more in general",
    "the forecast of the optical turbulence is crucial for the service mode i.e. the observation mode of all the top - class facilities of present time and it will be the observing mode of all new generation facilities .",
    "it is the observing strategy that will maximize the possibility to achieve outstanding scientific goals with the elts .",
    "the service mode implies the knowledge in advance of the status of the atmosphere ( atmospheric parameters and optical turbulence ) and the rank of the scientific programs .",
    "forecast _ of these parameters plays therefore a crucial role in the context of the high - angular resolution ground - based astronomy .",
    "besides , we have not to forget that the cost of a night of observations is of the order of a hundred thousand us dollars and it is therefore immediate to understand that the forecasts plays a crucial role not only in scientific but also in economical terms .",
    "the forecast we are dealing about aims to provide information in advance on a time scale @xmath6 t that is not inferior to 20 minutes .",
    "this is the typical time required to a beam to be shifted from an instrument to another in a configuration of permanents instruments placed in different focal stations .",
    "this is the configuration planned for new generation telescopes .",
    "our approach implies the use of atmospheric non - hydrostatic mesoscale models , more precisely a model called meso - nh @xcite for the atmospheric parameters joint with a dedicated code developed for the optical turbulence @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we call this model astro - meso - nh model .",
    "we refer the reader to the introduction of @xcite to know why mesoscale models are necessary instead of other typologies of models ( general circulation models ( gcm ) , direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , large eddy simulations ( les ) ) .",
    "mesoscale model are applied on limited areas of the earth .",
    "there are different typologies of mesoscale models depending on the typical extension of the limited area and the horizontal resolution used .",
    "we used here limited areas having a size between 800 and 10 kilometers square and a subkilometric horizontal resolution in the innermost domain in the neighboring of the site of interest . the optical turbulence ( ot )",
    "is completely parameterized in the mesoscale models .",
    "these characteristics guarantee to the astro - meso - nh model to reconstruct the ot maintaining the link with the spatio - temporal evolution of the atmospheric flow external to the limited areas i.e. to realize a real forecast of the ot .",
    "the astro - meso - nh model has been applied in the last decades to many among the most important astronomical sites such as cerro paranal in chile @xcite , san pedro mrtir in mexico ( @xcite ) , roque de los muchachos in canaries islands @xcite , mt . graham in arizona @xcite , dome c in antarctica ( @xcite ) . for completeness",
    "we remind that other studies concerning the ot forecast on the whole atmosphere have been carried out using other mesoscale or general circulation models and similar ( or different ) approaches in the astronomical context ( @xcite ) .",
    "we highlight three important considerations : * ( 1 ) * the paper contains necessarily only a selection of the most relevant results obtained for the ot related to an extended study lasted a few years ( and completed recently ) that provided a clear indication of the good efficiency of the astro - meso - nh model for an application to the service mode .",
    "these convincing results have induced eso to propose us to implement a demonstrator for an automatic operational version of the astro - meso - nh model applied to the sites of the vlt and the e - elt .",
    "this project will start in the next months . even if the research on the ot forecast is in a continuum evolution ( as well as that of the weather forecast ) and there is always space for improvements , in this feasibility study we achieved important steps ahead in terms of estimation of the model performances . due to the fact that we are entering in the new phase of the operational demonstration and more and more observatories are",
    "interested on such a kind of application it is important to provide the state of the art of the performances of our system . *",
    "( 2 ) * thanks to the development of our most recent algorithm of the @xmath0 we could prove to be able to achieve a vertical resolution of the @xmath0 all along the whole atmosphere up to roughly 150 m. this is a crucial achievement that opens interesting new perspectives for the most sophisticated adaptive optics systems i.e. the wide field adaptive optics ( wfao ) such as the ground layer adaptive optics ( glao ) @xcite , multi conjugated adaptive optics ( mcao ) ( @xcite ) , laser tomography adaptive optics ( ltao ) @xcite and multi objects adaptive optics ( moao ) @xcite . *",
    "( 3 ) * as expected , the model performances in forecasting the optical turbulence are not as good as in forecasting the atmospheric parameters ( at least so far ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spatio - temporal scales on which the ot fluctuates are much smaller than the grid - size and also to the fact that the turbulence is a stochastic quantity .",
    "this means that it is more difficult to describe numerically the optical turbulence .",
    "however , in spite of these intrinsic difficulties , we will see that results we achieved are very impressive and , even more important , are objectively already of great support for the service mode .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ obs ] we will describe the observations that we used as a reference to calibrate and to validate the model . in section [ astro - meso - nh ] we will described the model configuration used for this study . in section [ method ] we will describe the strategy used to calibrate and validate the model and in section [ results ] we will show the results obtained . in section [ cn2_hvr ]",
    "we show the model performances in reconstructing @xmath0 profiles with very high vertical resolution . in section [ concl ]",
    "we will present the conclusions and perspectives of this study .",
    "measurements provided by different instruments have been used to carry out this study . considering the scarcity of ot measurements related to cerro armazones , in agreement with eso",
    "the study on the optical turbulence has been performed only above cerro paranal .",
    "an important preliminary analysis having the goal to assure and test the reliability of the measurements has been performed with part of the instruments of the par2007 site testing campaign @xcite useful in our context : ( 1 ) a generalized - scidar ( more precisely the cute - scidar iii ) developed by the istituto de astrofisica de canarias ( iac ) team @xcite and corrected by @xcite to eliminate the error induced by the normalization of the autocorrelation of the scintillation maps by the autocorrelation of the mean pupil ( problem identified by @xcite and @xcite ) , ( 2 ) a multi - aperture scintillation sensor ( mass ) developed by the kornilov & tokovinin team @xcite and ( 3 ) a differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) an instrument that since 1988 is running at cerro paranal to monitor the seeing i.e. the integration of the optical turbulence developed all along the whole atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we had simultaneous gs and dimm measurements related to 20 nights .",
    "mass measurements were simultaneous to gs on a sub - sample of 14 nights .",
    "we note that the three instruments are located at basically the same height ( gs at 5  m above ground level ( a.g.l ) , dimm and mass at 6  m a.g.l . ) .",
    "moreover the vlt is basically a plateau and this guarantees a fair comparison between measurements .",
    "the re - calibration of the gs measurements was fundamental to assure us a reliable reference .",
    "as we will see later on , we decided to use the gs as a reference for the calibration of the astro - meso - nh model .",
    "besides , a detailed analysis of comparisons of measurements from the gs , mass and dimm @xcite permitted us to conclude that the mass could not be taken as a reference because of three main problems : * ( 1 ) * it underestimates the integrated turbulence ( j or seeing ) in the free atmosphere with respect to the gs with a relative error of -32@xmath7 in terms of the seeing ( -48@xmath7 in terms of j ) ; * ( 2 ) * we found important discrepancies between mass and gs in all the individual layers ( reaching relative errors as high as -65% in terms of seeing and -82% in terms of j ) with exception of the layers located at 2 and 16 km ( layers 3 and 6 ) in which the relative error remains limited to + 18% in terms of seeing ( + 20% in terms of j ) .",
    "a previous study on a similar topic @xcite ( even if it was applied on a poorer statistical sample ) found relative errors on individual layers as large as those we found in @xcite ; * ( 3 ) * the particular weighting functions ( wfs ) of the mass , having a triangle shape , do not permit to identify precisely the height of the boundary layer and in general the height separating a layer from the contiguous one .",
    "this represents an important limitation for the calibration of the astro - meso - nh model .",
    "thanks to dimm measurements ( a third independent instrument during the par2007 campaign together with gs and mass ) we could prove that the problem causing the discrepancies between gs and mass came from the mass .",
    "we cite here just the elements useful to justify why mass measurements could not be used to calibrate the astro - meso - nh model .",
    "an accurate estimate of the @xmath0 is indeed important for the model calibration and , because of the reasons we have just discussed , the mass could not assure that .",
    "besides , we remind that @xcite proved that the isoplanatic angle @xmath2 coming from the mass is reliable ( mainly thanks to the good reliability of the ot estimate in layer 6 located at 16 km above the ground ) and the @xmath3 measurements are reliable too ( just a few warnings with respect to this parameter - see the cited paper ) .",
    "this information is useful for the analysis done in this paper .    with these elements in mind we concluded we could use mass measurements of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to validate the model with respect to these parameters ( see section [ cal_val ] ) .",
    "mass is , indeed , an instrument currently running above cerro paranal at vlt observatory .",
    "after the model calibration , we could therefore validate the model with a more extended sample of nights not belonging to the par2007 campaign .",
