    "the production of circular polarization ( cp ) in radio sources is typically ascribed either to intrinsic synchrotron emission or to faraday conversion : a birefringence effect that converts linear polarization ( lp ) into cp @xcite . in a relativistic plasma",
    "the normal modes are elliptical and both faraday rotation and conversion are present .",
    "theoretically , the conversion due to propagation should dominate any contribution from intrinsic emission , however so far there are only few observational confirmations .",
    "the multi - frequency full stokes polarimetry is a powerful tool to study the radiation emission and transfer processes in the observed sources and determine the dominant mechanism for circular polarization production .",
    "cp , lp and spectral information can be used to constrain the low energy end of the relativistic particle distribution @xcite , derive magnetic field order , strength and geometry @xcite and make assumptions about the composition of the relativistic plasma within jets @xcite .",
    "measuring cp with a single - dish radiotelescope is a challenging task , due to the generally small values involved and the high accuracy required .",
    "we have developed a new procedure to calibrate full - stokes polarimetric data obtained with the effelsberg 100-m radiotelescope @xcite which allows a complete description of the instrumental mller matrix and its correction .",
    "we have tested it nearly monthly at 5 ghz on a sample of 43 sources during 2007 . in 2008",
    "we have applied our procedure to 2.7 , 8.5 and 10-ghz data of a sub - sample of four sources that systematically exhibited a level of cp above 3@xmath0 and fractional lp above 1% at all frequencies .",
    "the instrumental mller matrix elements contain information about the amount of contamination among the four stokes parameters , due to spurious , unwanted , conversions arisen inside the receiver .",
    "this clearly appears when dealing with completely unpolarized ( thermal ) sources ( e.g. the planetary nebulae ngc7027 and ngc6572 show levels of cp and lp of nearly 0.5% before the mller matrix correction ) .",
    "the sources were observed with 5-beam wide cross - scans centered on the source .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 values come directly from the polarimeter .",
    "the @xmath3 value has been estimated as difference of the left - hand circular and right - hand circular channels , after that these had been separately corrected for pointing ( to compensate for the beam squint ) and gain curve .",
    "the cross - scan technique intrinsically removes possible differences between the internal channel noises .",
    "the correction for the 4@xmath44 mller matrix has been applied by solving the equations for the leackage terms @xcite using ngc7027 as completely unpolarized calibrator and 3c286 as strongly linearly polarized one ( no assumption about stokes @xmath3 from the linearly polarized calibrator is required ) .",

    "* 0056 - 00 * : this source exhibits a change in sign of cp between 5 and 8.5 ghz , consistent with the minimum in lp and with the change in polarization angle .",
    "we have compared our results with those obtained with a model developed by beckert & falcke ( 2002 ) that provides the radiative transfer coefficients for polarized synchrotron radiation applied to the standard model for relativistic radio jets .",
    "the model assumes an extended unpolarized synchrotron source , which dominates the flux density below nearly 5 ghz which is modeled with energy equipartition between b - field and particles , @xmath5=4 mg , @xmath6 @xmath7 , and a typical power - law for electrons above @xmath8=100 , with @xmath9=2.45 ( power - law index ) .",
    "the size of the emitting region is @xmath10 cm .",
    "the polarized emission would be produced by a compact jet component of @xmath11 cm , @xmath5=90 mg , @xmath12=0.5 @xmath7 with a well - ordered magnetic field ( a tightly wound spiral ) seen at an angle of 85@xmath13 .",
    "this component becomes self - absorbed below 6 ghz and the emission is relativistically boosted with @xmath14=6 .",
    "this combination reproduces the observed level of circular polarization , the sign flip at nearly 8 ghz and the observed flux density . within the current model",
    "the minimum in lp is at lower frequencies and the simulated level of lp is too low which indicates that there might be an additional component ( even more compact ) that dominates lp and produces the turn in polarization angle at higher frequencies .",
    "the observed levels of cp are : @xmath15 at 2.8 ghz , @xmath16 at 5 ghz , @xmath17 at 8.5 ghz , @xmath18 at 10.ghz .",
    "* 0716 + 71 * : this bllac source exhibits a level of cp of : @xmath19 at 2.7 ghz , @xmath20 at 5 ghz , @xmath21 at 8.5 ghz , @xmath22 at 10.5 ghz and the minimum in cp is aligned with the minimum in lp and with the turn in polarization angle .    * 3c138 * : observed cp values for the quasar 3c138 are : @xmath23 at 2.7 ghz , @xmath24 at 5 ghz , @xmath25 at 8.5 ghz , @xmath26 at 10.5 ghz also in this case the minimum in lp is aligned with a drop in cp and with a turn in polarization angle .",
    "possible future cp measurements at higher frequencies could be helpful to identify the exact location of the cp minimum .    * 3c161 * : the quasar 3c161 presents a full stokes spectrum that differs from the others and appears more complicated as explained by our model .",
    "observed cp values are @xmath27 at 2.7 ghz , @xmath28 at 5 ghz , @xmath29 at 8.5 ghz , @xmath30 at 10.5 ghz .",
    "[ p:3c161 ]",
    "we have developed a new polarimetric calibration procedure that allows multi - frequency full stokes observations and can be generalized to any telescope equipped with circular outputs and radio polarimeters .",
    "after extensive testing carried out on 43 sources at 5 ghz , we have applied the calibration at 2.7 , 8.5 and 10 ghz obtaining the full stokes spectra of those four sources characterized by a level of cp above 3@xmath0 at 6 cm .",
    "we are comparing the observed results with those simulated by a model that assumes the faraday conversion as origin for the observed cp .",
    "the values observed in 0056 - 00 are consistent with those predicted by the model .",
    "a similar behavior seems to be indicated by preliminary studies on 3c138 and 0716 + 71 while the behavior of 3c161 is more difficult to explain and needs more thorough analysis .",
    "further full stokes measurements are planned at 14.5 and 32 ghz .",
