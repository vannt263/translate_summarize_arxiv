    "within the last few years , some concepts and tools in the field of quantum information science @xcite , such as entanglement and fidelity , have been introduced in the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite , which are described traditionally in terms of order parameters and symmetry breaking . however , without _ a _ _ priori _ knowledge of the order parameter , when a system undergoes qpt , its ground state will change dramatically . since the definition of fidelity is the overlap between two quantum states , it s natural to introduce it in the field of qpts .",
    "the most studied fidelity is the global ground state fidelity @xcite , which is an overlap between two ground states with a slight change of the parameters .",
    "therefore , to avoid the arbitrariness of the small change in numerical computation , zanardi et al .",
    "introduced the riemannian metric tensor @xcite , while you et al . suggested the fidelity susceptibility @xcite , which is an effective tool to study the critical properties",
    "so far , in most works , people have concerned with the global ground state fidelity .",
    "we note that as far as in ref  @xcite the authors have introduced a reduced fidelity which is defined as the trace of the product of two matrices .",
    "this definition is not rigorous in quantum - information theory , and they require one of the density matrices to be a pure state to agree with the rigorous mixed state fidelity @xcite . while in this paper , the reduced fidelity we used is defined rigorously in quantum - information theory and is studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the reduced fidelity susceptibility ( rfs ) is an efficient indicator of qpts .    in this paper , we study the scaling and critical behaviors of the rfs of two neighboring sites in the famous one - dimensional ( 1d ) transverse field ising model ( tfim ) .",
    "we note that the quantum critical properties of some other quantities like concurrence  @xcite and von neumann entropy  @xcite , and the global ground state fidelity susceptibility  @xcite have been studied in this model .",
    "however , the scaling and critical behaviors of them are quite different from the rfs for two neighboring sites .",
    "it s found that the scaling and critical behaviors of the rfs take the form of square of logarithm as @xmath0 for finite - size system and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the total number of spins and external parameter @xmath3 is the critical point ) in the thermodynamic limit , in contrast with the global fidelity susceptibility @xcite , which takes the form of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the different scaling and critical behaviors lead to a different finite - size scaling analysis , and for rfs we have to take its square root which is logarithmic divergent to carry out the scaling analysis .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review some concepts in fidelity and its susceptibility , and then we introduce a general formula of the rfs derived in @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , the scaling and critical behaviors are obtained analytically for both finite - size and thermodynamic limit , respectively .",
    "then , using the square root of the rfs , we perform a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "the scaling exponent is determined analytically , and is confirmed numerically .",
    "firstly , let us review some concepts in fidelity susceptibility .",
    "the hamiltonian of a quantum system undergoing qpts can be written as@xmath5 where @xmath6 is supposed to be the driving term with a control parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the fidelity between two rdms of the ground state @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined as @xcite @xmath10 the fidelity susceptibility is given by @xcite @xmath11 therefore we have @xmath12 .    in this paper , we study the rfs of two neighboring sites , and the rdm is block - diagonal as @xmath13 due to the specific symmetries in the 1d tfim , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are @xmath16 matrices . in @xcite , we have derived general formulas of rfs for density matrix of block - diagonal as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 s are @xmath16 matrices . however , in this work the density matrix satisfies @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 , then we give the formula under such case as follows  @xcite,@xmath22   ^{2}}{\\det\\left ( \\varrho_{i}\\right )   } \\right\\ }   , \\label{general_fidelity}%\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the ` susceptibility ' for block @xmath18 . from the above formula",
    "we can see that the rfs is only depends upon to the first derivatives of the matrix elements .",

    "the total spins are @xmath31 , and in this paper we consider @xmath2 is even , therefore @xmath32 is half odd integer . as is well known , there is a critical point exactly at @xmath33 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the transition in this model is of order to disorder type due to the competition between the ising coupling and the external magnetic field . for @xmath34 , the ground state of the system is paramagnetic , while for @xmath35 the strong ising coupling introduces a magnetic long - range order of the order parameter @xmath36 to the ground state .",
    "the rdm of two neighboring sites takes the form of  @xcite @xmath37 in the basis @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 spin up and down .",
    "the matrix elements are@xmath41 where the translation invariance of the 1d tfim is considered , and we set @xmath42 for convenience in what follows . from eqs .",

    "the hamiltonian could be diagonalized by using jordan - wigner , fourier and bogoliubov transformation sequently ( see @xcite ) , and the mean magnetization in the ground state is given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dispersion relation , @xmath46 with @xmath47 half odd integer .",
    "the neighboring two - point correlation functions are calculated as @xcite @xmath48    it s known that the most important themes in critical phenomena are scaling and universality . for a finite system , there are no singularities unless the ground state level crossing occurs . in the following , we will calculate the mean magnetization , the correlation functions and their first derivatives , and get the finite - size scaling and critical behaviors of rfs .",
    "the numerical results of the rfs for a finite - size system are shown in fig .",
    "[ sus_lambda ] , from which we can see that the peaks become sharper and sharper as the system size increases , and their locations approach to the critical point at the same time .",
    "it s expected that there will be singular at @xmath49 if @xmath2 is infinite .",
    "then to study the scaling behavior of rfs , we define its maximum over @xmath29 as @xmath50 with the location @xmath51 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fising_fig1.eps    for a finite - size system , @xmath52 , and yet if @xmath2 is large enough , @xmath51 is so close to @xmath49 that it s a good approximation for us to use @xmath53 in computing @xmath50 .",
    "the summations in eqs .",
    "( [ sz ] ) and ( [ correlation_func ] ) converge quickly as @xmath2 increases , which means for large @xmath2 , the summation can be replaced by the integral as@xmath54 then it s easy to evaluate the integrals and get@xmath55 however , the first derivatives of the above quantities are divergent with respect to @xmath2 at @xmath49 , and we have@xmath56 the main contribution to the above expressions in the large-@xmath2 limit arises from the summation around the zero point of @xmath57 , since@xmath58 where @xmath59 represents the singular area . immediately , with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ general_fidelity ] ) and ( [ correlation_func ] ) , we get @xmath60 the matrix elements and their derivatives could be evaluated by inserting the above results into eq .",
    "( [ mat_elem ] ) . here",
    "we should specifically consider @xmath61 , the divergent behaviors of @xmath62 and @xmath63 at @xmath64are both @xmath65 , while their difference is convergent and could be integrated as a constant:@xmath66 then , with eq .",
    "( [ rfs ] ) , we get the divergent form of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath2 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 are constants that could not be determined analytically , and the coefficient@xmath70 to perform a finite - size scaling analysis , we should find the logarithmic divergent quantity , and the above result suggests us to take the square root of @xmath50 for large @xmath2 to get the logarithmic divergent form as@xmath71    [ ptb ]    fising_fig2.eps    to confirm this , we compute @xmath72 numerically , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ sus_log_n ] , from which we can see that the slope is excellently consistent with @xmath73 , while the linear relation is obvious for not large @xmath2 because @xmath69 is small with numerical computation",
    ". however the maximum global ground state fidelity susceptibility @xmath74 is of a different scaling form as @xmath75const  @xcite , thus @xmath76 but not @xmath74 will exhibit similar scaling behavior with @xmath72 at the critical point .      in the thermodynamic limit the total spin @xmath2 is infinite ,",
    "then the summations can be replaced by the integrals ( [ sum_integral ] ) and are evaluated as : @xmath77},\\label{elliptic}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where k@xmath78 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and e@xmath78 is the elliptic integral of the second kind with @xmath79 .",
    "therefore the critical behavior of the rfs is determined by the elliptical integrals . at @xmath49 , we have @xmath80 , and e@xmath81 , while k@xmath82 is divergent as @xmath83 , its asymptotic behavior is @xmath84 from which we have k@xmath85 .",
    "then , obviously , at the critical point , with the above analysis we get the same results with ( [ expect_val ] ) in the previous subsection .    however , their derivatives are singular at @xmath3 .",
    "we take @xmath86 for example , @xmath87 where we have used the following relations @xmath88 then as @xmath29 approaches to @xmath49 , e@xmath89 converges quickly to 1 , and with eq .",
    "( [ elliptick ] ) we get@xmath90 which is logarithmic divergent as @xmath91 .",

    "it s noticed that the coefficients of the logarithmic terms are the same with those in the previous subsection for a finite - size system .",
    "then we get a similar divergent form of @xmath93 as@xmath94 where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , @xmath97 are constants that could not be determined analytically .",
    "as we have derived in the above , the divergent form of the rfs around the critical point is @xmath98 for finite system and @xmath99 in the thermodynamic limit . in order to make a finite size scaling analysis",

    "this function is universal and does not depend on system size @xmath2 . since @xmath95 , we determine the scaling exponent @xmath104 which is the same with the concurrence @xcite and the global ground state fidelity susceptibility @xcite , and is confirmed numerically shown in fig .",
