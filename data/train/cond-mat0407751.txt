    "the startling properties of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting electrons , commonly referred to as ( non - chiral ) tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) behavior,@xcite see refs .   for reviews , have recently moved into the focus of attention of the mesoscopic physics community .",
    "this was in particular prompted by the successful demonstration of electrical transport experiments for a variety of 1d materials , such as semiconductor quantum wires,@xcite fractional quantum hall edge states,@xcite and single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts).@xcite in this paper , we mainly focus on electrical transport in swnts to keep the discussion concrete .",
    "nevertheless , our results apply also to other systems .",
    "shortly after the theoretical proposal of tll behavior in individual metallic swnts,@xcite the first experimental evidence for this peculiar many - body state was reported.@xcite the expected tll power - law scaling in the energy - dependent tunneling density of states @xcite in swnts has been verified experimentally . in later experiments , @xcite transport through an intrinsic quantum dot formed by a double barrier within the swnt has been probed , allowing one to study the well - known resonant or sequential tunneling including coulomb blockade phenomena,@xcite but now for the case of leads formed by strongly correlated electrons .",
    "when varying an externally applied gate voltage , the linear conductance then typically displays a sequence of peaks , which can be interpreted as coulomb oscillations or resonant tunneling peaks , depending on the parameter regime .",
    "the peak spacing is governed by the charging energy @xmath0 and the plasmon level spacing @xmath1 on the dot ( the latter coincides with the single - particle level spacing @xmath2 for the case of noninteracting electrons ) .",
    "we mention in passing that a similar double - barrier experiment has been performed for semiconductor quantum wires , where in fact a tll power - law temperature dependence of the peak conductance was reported.@xcite in the nanotube experiments,@xcite two intramolecular barriers have been created within an individual metallic swnt , and a power - law temperature dependence of the conductance maximum has been reported.@xcite however , the exponent turned out to be inconsistent with expectations based on the sequential tunneling theory for a tll ; see below . the experiments clearly indicate that a detailed theoretical understanding of transport through a double barrier in a tll is required .    since the initial theoretical work on this topic,@xcite the double - barrier problem in a tll has attracted a significant amount of attention among theorists.@xcite",
    "those works show that the electron - electron interactions present in 1d leads imply significant deviations from the conventional theory for fermi liquid leads.@xcite this is most easily seen through the change of the temperature dependence of the linear conductance peak height , which now exhibits a typical tll power law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 depends on the interaction strength .",
    "as is discussed in detail below , for a tll , the exponent @xmath4 reveals the particular tunneling mechanism ruling transport through the dot .",
    "swnts possess an additional flavor degeneracy,@xcite which ( together with the spin degree of freedom ) can be captured by an effective four - channel tll model . for an analysis of the linear conductance on resonance , which is the focus of our work , however , a spinless single - channel tll turns out to be sufficient.@xcite within the standard bosonization method,@xcite the tll is then characterized by a boson field @xmath5 with conjugate momentum @xmath6 . including a symmetric double barrier , composed of short - range scattering centers at @xmath7 of strength @xmath8 , the basic hamiltonian is@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fermi velocity , @xmath11   , \\ ] ] and we put @xmath12 throughout this paper .",

    "moreover , we focus on the temperature dependence of the peak conductance , for which cotunneling is always a subleading process.@xcite therefore we neglect cotunneling throughout this work .",
    "this is not a fundamental restriction to our approach , but implies some technical simplifications . on resonance ,",
    "the basically only restriction for the validity of our master equation approach is then given by the condition @xmath56.@xcite    remarkably , the available experimental data obtained in swnts@xcite seem incompatible with eq .",

    "the interaction strength was deduced to be @xmath221 , corresponding to a tll parameter @xmath222 for the charged sector of the effective four - channel tll theory of swnts.@xcite the quantum dot was formed by two nearby buckles acting as tunneling barriers . since cst effects",

    "this point has also been clarified in other recent publications.@xcite unfortunately , this also excludes the possibility of an independent analytical check of our results .    to conclude , we hope that these novel features of interacting one - dimensional electrons will stimulate other theoretical work as well as further experimental checks of the cst versus ust picture put forward here .",
