    "since the landmark papers of marcus @xcite on the theory of electron transfer ( et ) reactions , the central role of the solvent in determining the et rate has been well recognized .",
    "the ordinary et reaction is an activated process @xcite , in which there is a free energy barrier separating reactants and products .",
    "this barrier is the result of the often strongly solvated donor and acceptor states , and the transfer of an electron then requires a specific large - scale reorganization of the environment , usually achieved through equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "et reactions are commonly thought to be well understood in two distinct limits ( see fig",
    ".  [ intro ] ) .",
    "first , for a very weak electronic coupling or the so - called nonadiabatic limit , the et can be treated with a perturbation theory @xcite , which to lowest order in the electronic coupling leads to the golden rule expression for the rate . for the opposite adiabatic limit in which the electronic coupling is large , the rate is thought to be controlled by the motion of the solvent on the lower electronic state and well described by classical activated rate theory @xcite . in both nonadiabatic and adiabatic theories",
    ", there is an assumed separation of timescales between the motions of the electron and the solvent . in the nonadiabatic limit ,",
    "the solvent fluctuations are assumed fast and the et is controlled by thermal excitations of the solvent to near the crossing region followed by a fast transversal of the crossing region by the solvent .",
    "the et rate is therefore controlled by the probability of an electronic transition proportional to the square of the electronic coupling .",
    "the adiabatic limit on the other hand is characterized by slow solvent fluctuations such that the born - oppenheimer approximation for the electron can be invoked . therefore according to conventional theories in these two limits ,",
    "the et rate is expected to depend on the electronic coupling @xmath0 like @xmath1/kt ) , & \\mbox{adiabatic }                            \\end{array }                   \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the temperature and @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "regarding the assumed separation of timescales , there are at least two aspects of et reactions which remain largely unclear and demand more complete theoretical treatments .",
    "first , there is the question of the `` crossover region '' . by this we mean the region between the nonadiabatic and the adiabatic limits in which the electronic matrix element changes from the weak coupling to the strong coupling limit . in this region , the assumed separation of timescales is necessarily violated .",
    "in fact , a successful dynamical crossover theory that can unify the two limits requires inclusion of high order electronic coupling terms @xcite , and such a theory has yet to be found .",
    "second , as is true in almost all condensed phase et reactions , the frequency spectrum of solvent motions is charac- terized by a broad distribution of timescales . hence , the assumption of timescale separation , while perhaps true for parts of the spectrum , may not be so for others .",
    "while it is commonly believed that fast solvent polarization has little effect on the et rate @xcite , unconventional behaviors have been suggested for solvents with high - frequency modes @xcite .",
    "indeed , stuchebrukhov and song @xcite have recently reported that high - frequency components in the solvent spectrum can substantially renormalize the intrinsic electronic coupling to slow down the otherwise adiabatic rate .",
    "the same adiabatic renormalization effects have also been recognized by others in a somewhat different context @xcite .",
    "the questions surrounding the influence of high - frequency modes in adiabatic reactions seem far from settled .",
    "the search for a unified treatment that can connect the conventional nonadiabatic and adiabatic theories presents a considerable challenge .",
    "early attempts were made by levich @xcite and zusman @xcite to use the landau - zener formula to incorporate higher - order effects in the electronic coupling into the et rate . along a similar line of thinking ,",
    "garg , onuchic and ambegaokar @xcite used an approximate real - time path integral treatment in an attempt to account for adiabaticity effects .",
    "more recent approaches @xcite have been largely based on an imaginary - time formulation of the problem .",
    "most noticeable of these is the centroid free energy method @xcite employed by gehlen et al .",
    "extensions of this to complex - valued centroid coordinates by stuchebrukhov and song @xcite have also been useful for obtaining results for the inverted region where nuclear tunneling is crucial .",
    "another imaginary - time theory which does not explicitly employ the centroid formulation has been given by cao et al .",
    "@xcite who focus on the computational aspects of instanton methods .",
    "all these theories rely on an assumed relationship between the et rate and an analytic continuation of the partition function for the tunneling system @xcite .",
    "this relationship , however has not been derived from first principles for the et problem .    in this paper , we take a rather different approach to the problem . with a spin - boson model for the et reaction ,",
    "our method sets out from an exact path integral formulation @xcite for the real - time _",
    "dynamics _ of the electron . from the path integrals",
    ", it is then easy to see that the et rate is related to clusters of kink / anti - kink pairs ( called `` blips '' ) @xcite which interact with each other through a nonlocal influence functional . when the fluctuations of the bath polarization are sufficiently fast compared to the motions of the electron , these interblip interactions vanish . in this case",
    ", the rate reduces to nonadiabatic theory and becomes completely equivalent to a low - order perturbation theory in the electronic coupling .",
    "on the other hand , when the bath motions are sufficiently slow compared to the electron , interblip interactions force blips to bunch up into clusters . in each cluster , multiple electronic transitions are possible , and the rate is now given by a series containing high - order terms in the electronic coupling . using standard graph theoretic techniques and a simple approximation for the self - energy ( i.e. , the sum over all irreducible diagrams ) , we are able to sum up an infinite number of terms in this series and obtain an expression for the et rate not only in the nonadiabatic and adiabatic limits , but for the entire crossover region . to our knowledge , this is the first successful real - time formulation that can span the whole crossover region .",
    "section [ spinboson ] gives a brief overview of the path - integral formulation of the dynamics of the spin - boson system . with minor modification",
    ", this material follow closely reviews by leggett @xcite and weiss @xcite . in section [ dyntransfer ] , the formal expression for the time - dependent dynamics",
    "is transformed diagrammatically to yield a rigorous result for the et rate .",
    "sections [ nonadrate ] and [ exactrate ] give a pictorial interpretation of the results , and section [ adcorr ] discusses general et behaviors in the two limits in terms of topological features of the graphs . section [ crossover ] presents a simple approximation which allows us to resum the entire perturbation series for the entire crossover region .",
    "some numerical results for the crossover behavior are also discussed .",
    "finally , section [ summary ] concludes this paper with a brief summary of the most important features of the present theory and our results .",
    "for the discussion of et dynamics in a donor - acceptor system in the condensed phase , we take the simple spin - boson model which has been used in many previous studies .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 defining two localized electronic states ( with a possible asymmetry @xmath6 ) and their overlap in the tight - binding approximation with a bilinear coupling to a number of solvent modes , which are assumed harmonic .",
    "only two quantities of the oscillator bath are relevant to the dynamics of the electron .",
    "they are the temperature associated with the initial thermal density matrix of the bath , and its spectral density @xmath7 a commonly used form of @xmath8 , which in the classical limit describes a frequency - independent friction , is the _ ohmic _ spectral density @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter which characterizes the strength of the dissipation .",
    "we shall use this spectral density throughout this paper .",
    "classically , the ohmic bath is characterized by a single parameter  the reorganization energy @xmath11 .    using standard path - integral techniques @xcite",
    ", a partial trace can be performed over the oscillator coordinates to eliminate them from the problem .",
    "one is left with an effective double path integral expression for the dynamics of the reduced density matrix for the electron .",
    "the forward- and reverse - time paths for the electron @xmath12 and @xmath13 are piecewise constant functions of time , alternating between the two allowed values @xmath14 .",
    "this particular class of functions can obviously be parametrized by the number of transitions between the two allowed values , the times at which these transitions occur , and the constant values the function assumes in the intervening intervals .",
    "applying this parametrization , and replacing @xmath12 and @xmath13 with symmetrized and antisymmetrized coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , an exact path - integral expression for the transition probability from position @xmath17 to @xmath18 can be written as @xcite @xmath19 where we have used the shorthand notation @xmath20 for the time - ordered integrals .",

    "because of the two - state nature of the electron coordinate , the charges are constrained such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these constraints imply that there are two kinds of time intervals on the double path  those intervals with @xmath35 ( dubbed ` sojourns ' by leggett et al .",
    "@xcite ) and those with @xmath36 ( called ` blips ' ) .",
    "the double path alternates between sojourns and blips and the expression ( [ pss ] ) for @xmath37 involves pair interactions between the charges . in ( [ pss ] ) , we have deliberately broken up the charge - charge interactions into `` intrablip '' terms ( @xmath38 ) and `` interblip '' terms ( @xmath39 ) .    all of the transition probabilities @xmath37 are related to each other by the conservation of probability . by symmetry they can be obtained from a single quantity @xmath40 after some ( possibly complicated ) initial transient , @xmath41 should follow a simple exponential decay with a inverse time constant equal to the _ net _ reaction rate @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the meaning of ( [ pss ] ) using diagrams .",
    "we begin with the nonadiabatic limit and proceed to the more general case at the end of the section .      in the limit of _",
    "nonadiabatic _ electron transfer , the infinite series in ( [ pss ] ) can readily be resummed using the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) @xcite .",
    "because we shall use this later as the basis of an exact expression for the reaction rate , we first discuss in detail the diagrammatic treatment of the nonadiabatic limit .    in the niba expression @xmath43 ,",
    "the factors @xmath27 , which denote interactions among charges belonging to different blips , are approximated by unity .",
    "this turns the multiple integrations in ( [ pss ] ) into convolution products , which can be laplace transformed .",

    "an appealing aspect of this approach compared to other dynamical methods is the fact that the dynamics at arbitrarily long times can be studied by evaluating the linked - cluster sum at small @xmath44 .",
    "first , in the high - temperature ( almost barrierless ) case , the et rate should depend on the electron coupling @xmath140 only through the adiabaticity prefactor .",

    "[ gvsd ] , which shows the dependence of the rate on the electronic coupling .",
    "for the parameters we have chosen here , the activation factor is close to unity , i.e. , the observed variation of the rate is mostly due to dynamical effects .",
    "our results are in agreement with the traditional expectation of an initially quadratic dependence on the electronic coupling that rises and saturates to a plateau value for very large electronic couplings .    for these parameters , as in mc simulations ,",
    "the time - dependent decay of @xmath41 shows initial oscillations before approaching a limit of exponential decay , fig .",
    "note that our method correctly reproduces the equilibrium value @xmath141 i.e. , the principle of detailed balance is preserved .",

    "[ arrh ] we present a set of arrhenius plots for increasing values of the electronic coupling , but keeping the classical reorganization energy constant . at the smallest value @xmath142 ,",
    "deviations from the niba are minute . for somewhat larger values of @xmath143",
    ", however , one finds significant discrepancies due to adiabaticity effects .",
    "the detailed features of these deviations conform to a number of known or intuitively expected characteristics of adiabatic electron transfer .",

    "the spin - boson model is used to represent electron transfer in condensed - phase from a donor to an acceptor site .",
    "relying on the established real - time path - integral representation of the spin - boson dynamics , we have for the first time rigorously deduced an _ exact _ rate expression in terms of the spin - boson parameters . in the nonadiabatic limit",
    ", our result reduces to the simpler niba description of spin - boson dynamics . using the linked - cluster theorem ,",
    "we have found a systematic way of summing up all corrections to the niba rate expression . since we are using a dynamical treatment directly",
    ", our method is valid under rather weak assumptions and it is applicable in _ any _ parameter region that would yield a long - time limit of exponential decay of the reactant population .",
    "we have demonstrated the relevance of our central results and the continued need for systematic groundwork for the electron transfer problem by pointing out significant discrepancies between results based on the linked - cluster sum ( [ selfsum1 ] ) and previous approximate real - time or imaginary - time approaches .",
    "we have also shown the usefulness of our approach by presenting a resummation of the most important terms in the linked - cluster sum ( [ selfsum2 ] ) .",
    "this resummation imposes no approximation on terms up to order @xmath110 , and it retains a large , dominant class of diagrams for any order of the electronic or environmental coupling .",
    "our results compare very favorably with published quantum monte carlo data and the results of a refined version of the resummation method .",
    "the present approach provides a unified treatment of several characteristic features of adiabatic electron transfer which were reported earlier , but separately , using incompatible methods .",
    "our results show two competing adiabatic effects .",
    "first , there is a rate reduction ( compared to the nonadiabatic case ) , which has previously been described in terms of correlated recrossings of the landau - zener region .",
    "this effect is dominant at high temperatures . for low enough temperatures",
    ", one sees a transfer rate that is enhanced over the nonadiabatic result .",
    "this reflects the lowering of the reaction barrier by the electronic coupling and by nuclear tunneling .",
