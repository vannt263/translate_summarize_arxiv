    "it was understood long ago @xcite that conventional description of interacting fermionic systems in the framework of landau fermi - liquid theory is not applicable in one dimension ( 1d ) because of infrared divergences .",
    "in particular , the second order of perturbation theory yields a singularity in the self - energy at the fermi surface , @xmath0 , implying a vanishing quasi - particle weight .",
    "this violates the one - to - one correspondence ( which plays the central role in the construction of the landau theory ) between unperturbed electronic states and elementary excitations of the interacting system .",
    "the lack of correspondence is a hallmark of the emerging strongly correlated electronic state - luttinger liquid ( ll ) .",
    "the physics of ll is known to be relevant for many systems available in experiment .",
    "the applications of this concept include carbon nanotubes @xcite , semiconducting and metallic nanowires @xcite , edge states of the samples in the quantum hall regime @xcite and spin ladders@xcite    in view of singular infrared behavior , it is hard to access ll by conventional methods of many - body fermion perturbation theory .",
    "to overcome this difficulty , a powerful approach  the bosonization  was developed .",
    "it is based on the fact that in 1d fermionic creation and annihilation operators have simple representations in terms of bosonic fields describing such observable as charge and spin density .",
    "thus , any 1d fermionic system is equivalent ( as long as considered energies are not too high ) to some ( generally interacting ) bosonic system .",
    "this fermi - bose equivalence was first discovered on the level of correspondence between correlation functions in fermionic and bosonic theories @xcite . later on ,",
    "underlying operator relations were derived by haldane @xcite , providing the solid basis for bosonization ( for a recent detailed exposition , see @xcite ) .",
    "bosonization has proven to be a very efficient tool for tackling 1d interacting fermions . in some cases it allows to obtain exact solutions of the problems that are highly non - trivial in the fermionic language .",
    "the canonical example of this is the tomonaga - luttinger model equivalent to free bosons . even in the case when bosonization does not produce free bosons , it often constitutes a convenient starting point for the development of the theory . using this approach , effects of backscattering @xcite , impurities @xcite , and underlying periodic potential @xcite on the ll were explored .",
    "many particular realizations of the ll states were addressed , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "nowadays , there is a growing interest in non - equilibrium phenomena in the ll phase . in particular , in a recent experiment @xcite , the tunneling spectroscopy of a biased ll was carried out .",
    "a similar approach was implemented to study experimentally carbon nanotubes @xcite and quantum hall edges @xcite .",
    "the experimental advances motivated theoretical interest to quantum wires out of equilibrium@xcite . in a related line of research , non - equilibrium chiral 1d systems have been studied theoretically @xcite , mainly in application to experiments on quantum hall edge - states interferometry .    in a series of papers by two of the authors and gefen @xcite",
    "the theory of non - equilibrium ll was developed .",
    "the formalism developed in these works combined the bosonization with the non - equilibrium keldysh action approach .",
    "it was shown that the calculation of single - particle green function reduces to the evaluation of certain fredholm determinants , analogous to those encountered in the context of counting statistics @xcite and non - equilibrium orthogonality catastrophe @xcite .",
    "this allowed to obtain comprehensive results for observables related to the fermionic single - particle green function , including the tunneling density of states , electron distribution function , and aharonov - bohm signal .",
    "more recently , the counting statistics of the charge transfer in a non - equilibrium ll was studied in @xcite .",
    "however , a number of fundamental questions have remained open .",
    "in particular , it is important to understand what kind of correlations ( if any ) are induced by the interaction between the electrons coming out of an interacting wire . in particular , are the left- and right - movers that have passed through the wire correlated ?",
    "we will see below that at equilibrium no such correlations exist . on the contrary , in a non - equilibrium ll electrons experience a specific type of relaxation .",
    "we will show that , in course of this relaxation process , non - trivial correlations in the electronic distributions are built . to characterize these correlations",
    "is the main task of this work .",
    "our approach to the problem is complementary to the one of ref .  .",
    "using the operator formalism , we determine explicitly the many - body density matrix @xmath1 of the ll conductor in a stationary non - equilibrium state . when written in the bosonic coherent - state basis , this non - equilibrium density matrix @xmath1 has a form of a fredholm determinant .",
    "the density matrix carries full information about many - body correlations in the non - equilibrium ll state .",
    "we find that the calculation of fermionic correlation functions with density matrix @xmath1 is greatly simplified by using a `` refermionization '' procedure . in this way",
    ", we can evaluate all fermionic correlation functions , with results expressed in terms of fredholm determinants .",
    "having developed our general formalism , we employ it to study four - point correlation functions of fermionic fields out of equilibrium and explore the correlations in the occupation numbers of the outgoing electrons induced by the interaction .",

    "we consider a 1d wire populated by spinless electrons of two chiralities ( labeled by @xmath2 ) interacting via local density - density interaction .",
    "the wire is connected to non - interacting electrodes . to model the",
    "later we will assume that the electron - electron interaction is switched off outside the central part of the wire ( fig .",

    "[ model ] ) and is zero for @xmath9 ( regions i and iii ) .",
    "this way of representing the non - interacting leads was used extensively in the literature for the analysis of the transport properties of luttinger liquids @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium state of the wire is induced by the injection of the electrons from the leads . following refs .",
    ", we assume that the right- moving electrons coming into the wire from the left lead have a stationary non - equilibrium distribution function @xmath10 , while the left - moving electrons coming from the right lead are characterized by the distribution function @xmath11 . the simplest non - equilibrium state arises when the leads are held at different temperatures @xmath12 , @xmath13 and different chemical potentials @xmath14 , @xmath15 so that the distribution functions of the incoming electrons are of the fermi - dirac form @xmath16 such a state was named the `` partial equilibrium '' in ref . @xcite .",

    "the leads are modeled via the assumption that the ll interaction constant @xmath7 is space dependent and vanishes outside the central part of the wire ( @xmath8 , region ii ) . ]    throughout the paper we assume the absence of the electron backscattering in the wire which can be caused e.g. by impurities . in order to avoid the electronic backscattering also from the boundaries of the interaction region",
    "we suppose that the function @xmath7 is smooth on the length scale of the fermi wavelength . withing this limitation , the formalism developed in this work",
    "can be applied to the case of arbitrary dependence of the interaction constant on @xmath6 .",
    "however , the most interesting situation arises when boundaries of the interaction region are sharp on the scale of the typical wavelength @xmath18 of the _ bosonic _ excitations . here",
    "@xmath19 is the fermi velocity and @xmath20 is some characteristic width of the distribution functions @xmath17 ( e.g. @xmath21 in the case of the partial equilibrium ) . under such circumstance",
    ", there is significant scattering of the _ bosonic excitations _ on the boundaries of the interaction region which is the primary source of the effects we are going to discuss in this paper .",
    "for this reason we concentrate bellow on this `` sharp boundary '' limit and model the @xmath6-dependence of the interaction constant by @xmath22    in ref .",
    "@xcite the single particle correlation functions of the model described above were investigate in great detail . while within the interacting part of the wire those correlation functions are highly non - trivial due to the combined effect of interaction and non - equilibrium , outside the interaction region the single particle green functions are much simpler , reflecting the free dynamics of the electrons .",
    "specifically , the single particle green functions of the right electrons to the right from the interacting region ( region iii ) has a form of the green functions of free fermions with some energy distribution @xmath23 . in the same way",
    ", the left - movers in the region i can be viewed as free particles with energy distribution @xmath24 .",
    "the correlation functions of incoming electrons , i.e. right - movers in the region i and left - movers in the region iii , are not affected by the interaction .",
    "the distribution functions @xmath25 differ from @xmath17 ( except for the case of complete thermal equilibrium ) , signaling the redistribution of the electrons over energies upon the passage through the interacting region @xmath26 .",
    "now an important question arises .",
    "is this redistribution ( which , crudely speaking , can be referred to as relaxation , although the resulting electronic distribution functions are not of the fermi - dirac type ) is the only effect of interaction on the outgoing fermions ?",
    "in particular , are the left- and right - movers coming out of the wire independent ?",
    "note that energy relaxation in our device is of a rather special character .",
    "due to the strong constraints imposed by the integrability of the ll model , no energy relaxation can occur in a uniform ll .",
    "the relaxation actually takes place at the boundaries of the interacting wire and involves the scattering of the bosonic excitations from one chiral brunch to another .",
    "since bosons are crudely speaking electron - hole pairs , we may anticipate that the relaxation should be accompanied by the buildup of correlations in the distribution functions of left- and right - electrons .",
    "we show below that this is indeed the case and the density matrix of outgoing fermions shows strong correlations . in particular , the irreducible correlation functions of the form @xmath27 between the occupation numbers of the outgoing fermions are non - zero .",
    "these emerging correlations are in the focus of the present work .",
    "we stress that the correlations in question are specifically non - equilibrium effect absent under the equilibrium conditions .",
    "we are now ready to present the formalism that we use in this work to explore correlations in a non - equilibrium ll wire .",
    "we start with a short review of the standard bosonization approach ( in the form of `` constructive bosonization''@xcite ) in application to equilibrium interacting fermions .",
    "we make particular emphasis on constructions that will be subsequently employed in the analysis of the non - equilibrium state .",
    "let us consider the 1d fermionic system with the hamiltonian @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the fermi momentum and @xmath30 represents the four - fermion interaction . within the luttinger liquid model one linearizes the spectrum of the fermions near the fermi points and adds unphysical ( but irrelevant at energies smaller than the fermi energy ) states below the bottom of the fermi sea .",
    "this way of treating the interacting fermions is justified for the description of low - energy properties of the system . at high energies effects related to the curvature of the spectrum ( not included in the ll model )",
    "may become sizeable , see , in particular ref .  .",
