    "interesting luminescence properties of rare - earth - doped strontium titanate have long been a subject of intensive studies . in particular , doping srtio@xmath2 with pr is known to result in the red luminescence . although the luminescence of srtio@xmath2(pr ) itself is rather weak , co - doping the samples with oxides of the group - iii elements ( al , b , ga , in ) enhances the luminescence efficiency up to 200  times .",
    "@xcite red - emitting srtio@xmath2(pr@xmath6,al ) phosphors are now promising materials for field - emission and vacuum fluorescent displays .",

    "the mechanisms responsible for maintaining charge neutrality in this material have not been identified yet .",
    "strontium titanate is a model system for studying physical phenomena resulting in ferroelectricity .",

    "it turned out that with increasing concentration of pr at the @xmath61  sites , the agreement of the curves becomes worse .",

    "according to the second pauling s rule ,  @xcite the perovskite structure is electrostatically compensated , which means that the sum of the strengths of the electrostatic valence bonds of sr@xmath11 and ti@xmath7 cations which reach the o@xmath67 anion is equal to the ionic charge of the anion .",

    "an increase in the intensity of two unresolved peaks at 49724975  ev , which are attributed to the dipole - forbidden transitions of the ti @xmath72 electron into the @xmath73 and @xmath71 orbitals of neighboring tio@xmath31 octahedra ,  @xcite is probably a consequence of the pr - induced disorder in our samples .",
    "the formation of ti vacancies in our samples is improbable because otherwise the excess of ti would precipitate as the tio@xmath33 phase ; the peaks of this phase were absent in our x - ray diffraction patterns .",
    "therefore , the most important charged defects that maintain charge neutrality in pr - doped srtio@xmath2 are sr vacancies .",
    "the existence of sr vacancies in ( sr@xmath0pr@xmath1)tio@xmath2 samples with high @xmath5 implies the precipitation of excess sr .",
    "for example , in the sample with @xmath13 , the concentration of @xmath28 should be equal to 7.5% , so that this amount of excess strontium should be precipitated as an oxide phase which can be easily detected in x - ray experiments .",
    "however , no additional peaks were observed in x - ray diffraction patterns of the ( sr@xmath50pr@xmath51)tio@xmath2 sample . at the same time",
    ", it is well known that in the srtio@xmath2sro system the excess sr can form so - called planar faults , which are stacking faults consisting of one extra sro layer inserted between sro and tio@xmath33 layers in the srtio@xmath2 structure and intergrown coherently with the adjacent layers .",

    ", we believe that excess sr forms planar faults as well .",
    "but in this case , the absence of the diffraction peaks of the ruddlesden - popper phase simply indicates the absence of the long - range order in the arrangement of sro planar faults .",
    "we think that randomly distributed pr@xmath6@xmath28 complexes act as pinning centers for the motion of sro planar faults , and so their regular arrangement can not be achieved .    from the previous discussion it follows that there are two possible positions of sr atoms in our samples : the sr sites in the srtio@xmath2 perovskite layers and the sr sites in the sro planar faults . in the ruddlesden - popper phases , different impurity atoms substitute for different sr sites : for example , ba atoms predominantly enter the srtio@xmath2 layers , thus forming a solid solution ,  @xcite whereas ca atoms predominantly enter the sro planar faults .",
    "@xcite to refine the position of the pr atoms in our heavily doped samples , we additionally analyzed our exafs spectra in the model in which pr atoms substitute for sr atoms in the sro planar faults .",
    "initial structural positions of atoms were taken from the crystal structure of the sr@xmath2ti@xmath33o@xmath44 ruddlesden - popper phase .",
    "because of the similarity between the crystal structures of srtio@xmath2 and the ruddlesden - popper phase ( a half of the ruddlesden - popper - phase structure nearly coincides with the perovskite structure ) , the calculated exafs spectra for these structures were similar .",
    "nevertheless , a better agreement with the experimental exafs spectra was obtained for the model in which the pr atoms substitute for the sr atoms in the srtio@xmath2 layers . this is not surprising because to incorporate the pr atoms into the sr sites in the sro planar faults , these planar faults should be first created by the sr@xmath30pr substitution in bulk srtio@xmath2 .",
    "the defect model proposed in this work explains the influence of addition of al and other trivalent impurities ( ga , in , b ) on the intensity of the red luminescence in pr - doped srtio@xmath2 . as was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , co - doping srtio@xmath2(pr ) with the trivalent impurities can enhance the luminescence efficiency up to 200  times .",
    "we think that both sr vacancies and sro planar faults act as non - radiative centers in srtio@xmath2(pr ) .",
    "the addition of trivalent impurities results in two effects : ( 1 )  partial substitution of titanium by trivalent impurity maintains charge neutrality of the samples and excludes the creation of sr vacancies , and ( 2 )  x - ray amorphous phase based on the oxide of trivalent impurity `` absorbs '' the planar faults . as a result ,",
    "the addition of trivalent impurity `` purifies '' the grains of srtio@xmath2 from point and planar defects , thus creating optimal conditions for radiative recombination .    an increase of the structural phase transition temperature @xmath77 when doping srtio@xmath2 with pr is not surprising because the ionic radius of pr@xmath6 is less than that of sr@xmath11 : the decrease of the @xmath62  atom size in the perovskite structure decreases the tolerance factor , and the instability of the structure against octahedra rotations increases .",
    "more surprising is the fact that the @xmath78 rate for pr doping is higher than that for ca doping ( the impurities have the same ionic radius ) . for pr doping",
    ", the temperature @xmath77 reaches 300  k at @xmath16 ,  @xcite whereas for ca doping @xmath77 reaches 300  k only at @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite we believe that such a strong effect of pr doping on @xmath77 is due to the presence of sr vacancies which influence the octahedra rotation in a manner similar to the influence of small _ a _ cations .    in this work , we considered exclusively the structural properties of pr - doped srtio@xmath2 and established that pr is not an off - center ion and doping with pr is not accompanied by creation of the oxygen vacancies in tio@xmath31 octahedra .",
    "the weak effect of the pr concentration on the temperature of the dielectric anomaly  @xcite and a gradual change of the soft mode frequency at the temperature of this anomaly  @xcite indicate that this anomaly is not associated with the bulk of the crystal .",
    "we think that the model of ferroelectricity in a system of frozen pr@xmath6@xmath28 electric dipoles  @xcite is also unreasonable because it can not explain the switching of polarization , and the local electric fields around defects reduce the lattice susceptibility and therefore can only decrease the curie temperature .",
    "@xcite so , none of the models mentioned in sec .  [ sec1 ] can explain the appearance of ferroelectricity .    in our opinion , a possible cause of the dielectric anomaly may be the appearance of the conductivity associated either with the ionization of the pr donor levels ( pr@xmath6@xmath30  pr@xmath7 + e@xmath80 ) or with a thermally - assisted hopping of electrons between pr atoms which can exist in two different oxidation states ( pr@xmath6 and pr@xmath7 ) .",
