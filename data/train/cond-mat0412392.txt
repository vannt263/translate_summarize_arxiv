    ". introduced in 1963 by jaynes and cummings , @xcite this model has yet to be completely solved despite its apparent simplicity .",
    "the approach taken by the original authors , known as the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , relies upon the assumptions of near - resonance and weak coupling between the two systems .",
    "the rwa is widely used because it is readily solvable and describes quite accurately the standard physical realization of such a system : an atom coupled to a field mode of an electromagnetic cavity . in this experimental situation ,",
    "the coupling strength between the atom and the field is largely determined by the intrinsic dipole moment of the atom ; for all experiments to date , the coupling strength @xmath0 is very small compared to the atomic transition frequency @xmath1 ( @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite the near - resonance condition is necessary to ensure validity of the two - level description of the atom .",
    "thus the rwa is a natural , and excellent , approximation in such a system .",
    "quantum - limited solid state devices offer an alternative to the traditional atom  cavity implementation of the spin  oscillator system .",
    "recent experiments have shown clear spectroscopic evidence that a cooper - pair box ( cpb ) , or josephson charge qubit , coupled to a superconducting transmission line behaves much like an atom in a cavity .",
    "the dipole coupling between the two systems is @xmath4 , @xmath5 orders of magnitude larger than that achieved in atomic systems .",
    "@xcite capacitive or inductive couplings offer the possibility of still larger coupling strengths than those possible with dipole coupling , even at large detunings between the fundamental frequencies of the oscillator and the two - level system . some results from a flux - based",
    ", inductively - coupled system give preliminary evidence for coupled quantum behavior and entanglement between the two - level system and the oscillator .",
    "@xcite another intriguing possibility involves capacitively coupling a cpb @xcite or a josephson phase qubit @xcite to a nanomechanical resonator ( nr ) .",
    "all of these systems are capable of accessing coupling strengths and detunings outside the regime in which the rwa is valid , requiring different theoretical approaches to the problem .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "details a perturbative treatment which is valid for moderately strong coupling ( @xmath6 ) at zero detuning .",
    "in this paper we discuss an approximation which is able to treat strong coupling and large detuning .",
    "it is valid when the splitting frequency of the two - level system is much smaller than the frequency of the oscillator and holds well even for coupling strengths up to or larger than the oscillator frequency .",
    "the approximation is used to examine the time evolution of the two - level system when the harmonic oscillator begins in a thermal state or a coherent state .",
    "several effects of the coupling to the oscillator are distinguished , including enhanced apparent decoherence rates , frequency modification , and collapse and revivals of rabi oscillations .",
    "we focus particularly on collapses and revivals in this model .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the form of the hamiltonian to be considered and derive the adiabatic approximation . in sec .",
    "[ dynamical ] we evaluate the approximate time evolution of the two - level system coupled to , respectively , a fock state , a thermal state , and a coherent state of the oscillator , and classify the behavior in several parameter regimes .",

    "the most common approach is to assume that the two - level system and the oscillator are close to resonance , ( @xmath9 , and that the coupling between them is weak , @xmath10 .",
    "then terms which do not conserve energy may be discarded ( the rwa ) , resulting in what is usually termed the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) .",
    "@xcite as mentioned in the introduction , this is an appropriate approximation for atom - cavity experiments ; however , unlike atom - cavity systems , the solid - state system we are considering has the potential for strong coupling at large detunings . in this paper",
    "we will treat the case in which the two - level - system splitting frequency is much smaller than the oscillator frequency , @xmath11 , and the coupling strength is allowed to be large , on the order of or greater than the oscillator frequency .",

    "the eigenstates of this operator are displaced fock ( number ) states , @xmath26 with energies given by @xmath27 these approximate eigenstates and energies constitute the displaced oscillator basis , which will be used throughout subsequent calculations .",
    "an illustration of the displaced - well potentials and the corresponding energy levels is given in fig .",

    "this basis has a simple interpretation in the cpb - nr system . due to the capacitive coupling , one charge state of the cpb",

    "as long as the stretching of the beam due to the attraction is small , the nr will remain approximately linear and may still be described as a harmonic oscillator . however , the position of the harmonic potential well will have shifted .",
    "this is precisely the situation described mathematically by the displaced oscillator basis , which allows the use of the ordinary harmonic oscillator formalism within each displaced potential well .",
    "the correspondence of physical position displacement to the formal displacement operator makes this a natural basis to work in .",

    "although the states @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) form an orthonormal basis with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not mutually orthogonal .",
    "this may be understood easily in position space , where the displacement operator corresponds to a displacement in @xmath35 .",
    "consider , for example , the harmonic oscillator ground state @xmath36 , which has a gaussian form : this state displaced by a finite amount is never completely orthogonal to the same state displaced by the opposite amount , although the displaced states may become very nearly orthogonal if the displacement is large enough .",

    "note that @xmath39 .",
    "together with the fact that @xmath40 is real , this implies that @xmath41 , which is a useful identity .",
    "the lack of orthogonality between different displacements leads to the unusual results in the two - level - system dynamics which will be found later .",
    "the next step is to reintroduce the two - level - system self - energy , @xmath42 , which is assumed to be small .",
    "reformulating the problem in terms of a matrix written in the displaced oscillator basis allows the approximation to be carried out in a natural way . using the overlap functions calculated above",

    "the condition @xmath11 may be seen as a statement about statics : the spacing of the oscillator energy levels is very large compared to the spacing of the two - level system , so a transition in the two - level system can never excite the oscillator . an alternative argument , found in sec .",
    "iii(c ) of ref .  , relies on the separation of characteristic times in the two systems : given the assumption @xmath11 , the oscillator responds almost instantaneously to changes in @xmath47 , so that the oscillator dynamics is `` slaved '' to the two - level - system dynamics .",

    "@xmath53 the distance between the wells becomes infinite , and the overlap @xmath54 . with no mixing between the wells",
    "the spectrum becomes that of two identical harmonic oscillators and the energy levels become pairwise degenerate .",

    "the plot shown here demonstrates that the adiabatic approximation breaks down in this regime except in the broadest qualitative sense .",
    "when @xmath61 spurious level crossings appear at small values of @xmath50 , and a substantial phase difference develops between the ripples in the numerical and approximate solutions .",
    "thus it may be seen that , as expected , the adiabatic approximation is not a reasonable treatment for @xmath62 .",
    "the displaced oscillator basis provides a physically intuitive picture for the derivation of an adiabatic approximation in the regime @xmath63 . comparing the adiabatic approximation with a numerical solution of the full hamiltonian shows that the approximation works quite well in the regime for which it was derived .",

    "much of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to a study of those consequences .",
