    "besides , in the opposite direction , we also proved that the presence of the boundary does not affect the singular behavior of the core - induced contribution on the self - energy for the flower - pot model . as to the self - energy near the monopole s center , we could see that the presence of the boundary produces a correction on the corresponding quantity when compared with the case of absence of boundary ; moreover , this correction becomes weaker for larger values of the sphere radius . in the flower pot model ,",
    "the force near the core s boundary is attractive ( repulsive ) with respect to this boundary for @xmath177 ( @xmath163 ) for both dbc and nbc . in the ballpoint pen model and for a minimally coupled scalar field ,",

    "the complete analysis for the self - energies , in the regions inside and outside the core , are exhibited numerically in the graphs [ fig3 ] and fig4 for the flower - pot model and ballpoint pen model , respectively .",
    "for the flower - pot model , the graphs exhibit the singular behavior near the core s boundary ; as to the ballpoint pen one , we were able to provide the behavior of the self - energy for both regions in a single plot .",
