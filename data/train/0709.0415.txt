    "the theory of dynamic equations on time scales ( or , more generally , measure chains ) was introduced in 1988 by stefan hilger in his phd thesis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the theory presents a structure where ,",
    "once a result is established for a general time scale , then special cases include a result for differential equations ( obtained by taking the time scale to be the real numbers ) and a result for difference equations ( obtained by taking the time scale to be the integers ) . a great deal of work has been done since 1988 , unifying and extending the theories of differential and difference equations , and many results are now available in the general setting of time scales  see @xcite and references therein .",
