    "point - like , off - nuclear x - ray sources with luminosities in excess of the eddington limit for one solar mass are increasingly discovered in nearby galaxies . despite the growing body of observational data , the mechanism which powers ulxs is still under debate . in several cases a variability on timescales of months",
    "/ years has been detected , hinting towards the presence of a compact object .",
    "were these sources x - ray binaries in the host galaxy , assuming eddington - limited accretion , masses in the range @xmath2 are inferred for the compact object from the observed flux .",
    "imbh may have originated from the collapse of a massive star formed in a low metallicity environment , or through merging of massive stars ( or lower mass bhs ) in a cluster @xcite .",
    "the bh mass estimates derived from considerations involving the eddington limit are , however , questionable because these sources need not to be spherically symmetric , nor stationary .",
    "it has been proposed that many of the ulx properties can be explained assuming that they do not emit isotropically @xcite or are dominated by emission from a relativistic jet @xcite . in this case",
    ", they may harbor stellar mass bhs and may be similar to galactic microquasars .",
    "+ particularly interesting is the case of the three ulxs hosted in the nearby sbc galaxy ngc 1313 .",
    "one of them is known to be associated with the interacting supernova sn 1978k @xcite .",
    "the other two have been extensively studied with several x - ray telescopes and , to date , provide some of the best evidence for the presence of a soft component in the x - ray spectrum of ulxs . moreover , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , hereafter z04 , their continuum subtracted _ xmm _ epic - pn spectra show significant residuals especially in the 0.53 kev range .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observed ngc 1313 on october 17 , 2000 for a total of @xmath3 42 ks . the field was centered on the galaxy nucleus and contains all the three ulxs .",
    "the three _ xmm _ epic cameras operated in prime full window mode with the medium filter .",
    "the analysis reported here follows that presented in z04 .",
    "we consider only the epic - pn spectrum because it has twice as many counts as each single mos instrument .",
    "the epic - pn spectrum was directly extracted from the observation data file because the automatic pipeline processing failed to produce an event list .",
    "data screening , region selection and event extraction were performed with the standard software xmm - sas v 6.0.0 . in order to eliminate the possible contamination of solar flares ( present during the observation ) ,",
    "event files were filtered using the good time intervals when the total off - source count rate above 10 kev is less than 1 counts s@xmath4 . this leave @xmath5 ks of useful time with an average count rate of @xmath6 counts s@xmath4 for ngc 1313 x-1 and @xmath7 counts s@xmath4 for ngc 1313 x-2 .    the best fit of the _ xmm _ epic - pn continuum for both sources is obtained with an absorbed soft , thermal component ( a multicolor disk blackbody , mcd ) plus a power - law . in comparison with previous _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ data the statistics is sufficiently good that two components models provide a significant improvement over single component ones ( see z04 ) .",
    "the statistical improvement obtained adding a mcd component to a power - law model is significant above the @xmath8 level .",
    "the resulting best fitting parameters for ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 are reported in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the inferred inner disk temperature is much lower than that obtained for single component thermal models , as already found by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity in the 0.210 kev range , assuming isotropic emission and a distance of the host galaxy @xmath9 mpc , is @xmath10erg s@xmath4 for ngc 1313 x-1 and @xmath11erg s@xmath4 for ngc 1313 x-2 .",
    "if at maximum the source radiates at the eddington limit , the bh mass is @xmath12 for x-1 and @xmath13 for x-2 .",
    "sub - eddington accretion would imply an even larger mass .",
    "residuals in the epic - pn spectra of ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 suggest the presence of some emission lines in both sources . in order to test for the presence of spectral features , we added , one by one , gaussian components at different energies where residuals show evidence of some excess in emission .    for ngc 1313 x-1 ,",
    "the most significant residual is at around 0.6 kev , identified with a high ionization ( he - like ) oxygen line ( see figure 1 ) . adding a gaussian component , the improvement of the fit with respect to an absorbed mcd+pl model is significant at the 3.5 @xmath14 level .",
    "the line energy is 0.58 kev , while the line width was frozen in the fit ( 0.01 kev ) .",
    "residuals show also an excess of emission at energies of 1.8 and 4.7 kev ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the first is the typical energy of highly ionized silicon , while the second is not readily identified .",
    "adding other two gaussian components for fitting these residuals does not give any further statistical improvement in the fit .",
    "a similar analysis was performed also on the epic - pn spectrum of ngc 1313 x-2 , following the same approach outlined above .",
    "also in this case the spectrum shows some residuals at an energy of 0.6 kev . in order to test the influence of ism absorption models",
    "( due to the neutral oxygen absorption edge , see @xcite ) on the detection of an o line in ngc 1313 x-1 , we repeated our analysis using the tbingen - boulder absorption model ( tbabs ; @xcite , table [ tab1 ] ) , that includes a treatment of gas - phase ism with revised photoionization cross sections and revised abundances ( plus the contribution of grain - phase ism and molecules ) .",
    "the improvement obtained adding a gaussian component to a tbabs+mcd+pl continuum is at the @xmath15 level .",
    "the line energy is 0.6 kev , while the line width was frozen in the fit ( 0.01 kev ) .",
    "the significance of the line remains fairly high even performing a fit in a restricted energy region ( 0.31.0 kev ) around the centroid of the gaussian .",
    "fitting the continuum with an absorbed mcd+pl model , the addition of a gaussian component with fixed width ( 0.01 kev ) gives an improvement at the @xmath16 level .",
    "additional information on the line properties were obtained analyzing the line profiles . after freezing the best fitting continuum of table [ tab1 ] and removing the gaussian components , residuals ( normalized to the continuum )",
    "were fitted with a constant ( equal to unity ) plus a gaussian profile , obtaining the lines centroid energies and equivalent widths .",
    "the energies are consistent ( within the errors ) with those derived from the spectral fits , while the equivalent widths are all below 100 ev .",

    "optical images of the field of ngc 1313 x-2 in the @xmath17-band were taken on 16 january 2002 with the 3.6 m telescope of the european southern observatory ( eso ) at la silla ( chile ) .",
    "four images were obtained for a total exposure time of 1320 s ( see z04 for details ) .",
    "the accuracy of the astrometric calibration , performed with gsc2 eso field stars , is 0.3@xmath18 ( 1-@xmath14 ) .",
    "the x - ray position of ncg 1313 x-2 was obtained from a 2002 _ chandra _ pointing with an accuracy of 0.7@xmath18 ( z04 ) .",
    "the astrometric calibration of the optical and _ chandra _ images was checked using the very accurate radio position of sn 1978k ( @xcite , z04 ) .",
    "our _ chandra _ position of ngc 1313 x-2 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] , together with the _ rosat _ hri @xcite and _ xmm _ epic @xcite error boxes , overlaid on our eso image .",
    "all measurements are consistent within 1-@xmath14 .",
    "object c ( @xmath1 ) is inside the chandra error box and its position coincides within 1-@xmath14 with that of ngc 1313 x-2 , making it a likely counterpart and ruling out the previous proposed counterpart , object a. from the maximum absorbed x - ray flux of ngc 1313 x-2 ( @xmath19 erg @xmath20 s@xmath4 ) and optical magnitude of object c , we estimate @xmath21 .",
    "the x - ray spectral parameters , in particular the temperature of the mcd fit ( @xmath22 ) , can be used to estimate the bh mass . from the effective temperature of a standard accretion disk , under the assumption that @xmath22 represents an estimate of the maximum disk temperature ,",
    "z04 infer @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is a color correction factor ) . the temperature obtained from the two - components fit to the _ xmm _ spectrum ( table [ tab1 ] ) implies @xmath25 for ngc 1313 x-1/x-2 ( assuming @xmath26 and eddington limited accretion ) .    up to now evidence of emission lines in ulxs",

    "the presence of an oxygen line in the epic - pn spectrum of ngc 1313 x-1 appears to be significant at above @xmath27 while the statistical evidence of other features is at most marginal ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that we are observing typical emission features of intermediate mass elements left over after the explosion of one or more supernovae belonging to the stellar association of massive stars where the two ulxs are probably embedded .",
    "concerning ngc 1313 x-2 , the luminosity inferred from the apparent magnitude of object c is consistent with a @xmath29 main sequence star or a @xmath30 evolved ob supergiant making ngc 1313 x-2 a high - mass x - ray binary .",
    "this picture seems to be confirmed also by the study of the environment of ngc 1313 x-2 ( see z04 ) and by the association of both ulxs with extended optical emission nebulae @xcite .",
