    "the integration of optics and microfluidics on lab - on - a - chip microsystems has recently been the topic of much research  @xcite , partly motivated by its diverse applications in chemical and biochemical analysis  @xcite .",
    "the miniaturization of chemical analysis systems , however , presents many optical challenges since light matter interactions suffer from the reduced optical path length @xmath3 in lab - on - a - chip systems compared to their macroscopic counterparts as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for beer  lambert absorption measurements in a lab - on - a - chip system , a typical size reduction by two orders of magnitude severely reduces the optical sensitivity in an inversely proportional manner .",
    "this drawback is even more pronounced for gas detection in microsystems as most gases have a very weak absorption line .",
    "thus , microsystems may not seem the obvious solution for gas sensing and detection . on the other hand ,",
    "the major reason for being interested in pursuing microsystem opportunities is of course that many applications call for compact gas sensors because of limited sensor space . on the more practical level , we emphasize that lab - on - a - chip systems can both address very minute volumes ( no flow ) , but also allows for measurements of larger volumes flowing through the microchannels where detection takes place . in that way",
    ", spatial variations in the gas properties can potentially be mapped onto a time axis and monitored through time - traces of the optical signal .",
    "this space - time mapping is a general approach ( employed for a variety of other measurements ) which is only possible in microchannels supporting laminar flow . for the optical sensitivity ,",
    "it has been proposed , that by introducing a porous and strongly dispersive material , such as a photonic crystal , into the lab - on - a - chip microsystems one could potentially solve these problems through slow - light enhanced light - matter interactions  @xcite .",
    "first experimental evidence of this effect for gas sensors in the mid - infrared range was reported by lambrecht _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . here , we extend the perturbative theory in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of a dispersive bragg stack infiltrated by a spectrally strongly dispersive gas with a narrow and distinct absorption peak .",
    "we emphasize the example of oxygen monitoring and sensing based on the two distinctive bands near the visible to near - infrared light range of 760  nm referred to as the o@xmath0 a band  @xcite .",
    "spectral data are available from the hitran database  @xcite .",
    "though , the a band has a very weak absorption feature , it offers the potential to establish an optical _ in situ _",
    "o@xmath0 detection for application in many fields including combustion processes  @xcite and fire research  @xcite .",
    "in gas detection experiments , one typically uses beer  lambert absorption to determine the concentration of the substance of interest . as the light traverses the test chamber the light intensity is exponentially attenuated according to the relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the absorption coefficient , typically a linear function of the concentration @xmath6 of absorbing molecules ( not to be confused with @xmath7 ; the speed of light in vacuum to be introduced at a later stage ) .",
    "any reduction in the optical path length @xmath3 will penalize the sensitivity of the optical measurement significantly .",
    "however , by using a porous photonic crystal , it has been suggested that one may effectively enhance @xmath5 by slowing down the light via a photonic crystal thereby overcoming the short path length obstacle in microsystems  @xcite . to quantify the enhancement , we shall use the ratio @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the absorption coefficient inside the photonic crystal and @xmath10 the corresponding homogeneous space absorption coefficient associated with the gas itself .",
    "the subscripts are introduced in order to carefully distinguish between absorption taking place in the photonic crystal material and the gas , respectively . in this work",
    "we consider the particular simple one - dimensional example of a bragg stack and extend previous work  @xcite by using a more realistic model for the gas absorption profile .",
    "the periodic bragg stack is illustrated in panel  ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] and is composed of alternating layers of gas and solid of thickness @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . the lattice constant is @xmath13 and for the dielectric functions we allow for complex - valued bulk parameters , i.e. @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for later convenience",
    "we rewrite the dielectric functions in terms of the bulk refractive index @xmath16 and the damping coefficient @xmath5 ,    @xmath17    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the free - space wave vector with @xmath20 being the corresponding free - space wavelength and @xmath21 the angular frequency .",
    "the dispersion relation for the bragg stack is governed by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the bloch wave vector and @xmath24    in the following we explicitly write the bloch wave vector as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are real and imaginary parts , respectively . the imaginary part causes an exponential damping of the bloch states with a corresponding attenuation coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "likewise , in the homogeneous case we have @xmath29 and in this way eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) now becomes @xmath30 if @xmath31 is greater than unity , it means that we have enhanced absorption due to the geometry of the bragg stack .",
    "the absorption enhancement comes about because the group velocity of the light @xmath32 is reduced by the geometry of the bragg stack  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , the slow light phenomenon manifests itself through an increasing imaginary part of the bloch vector @xmath27 as the band edge is approached . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) , we have separated the two different contributions to the absorption from the gas and the solid , thus implicitly assuming a small change in attenuation caused by the presence of the gas .",
    "however , we emphasize that the effect of material dispersion is included in the dispersion relation in an exact analytical and non - perturbative way and thus our results fulfill the kramers  kronig relation by taking the full interplay between waveguide and material dispersion into account .",
    "in the following we illustrate the prospects for slow - light enhanced absorption by means of examples .",
    "first , we consider the problem of two non - absorbing materials , say a gas and a polymer with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding band diagram , obtained from a numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : disprel ] ) , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : bandiag1 ] .",
    "two band gaps , indicated by yellow shading , are visible near @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "as can be seen , the group velocity approaches zero near the band gap edges while the imaginary part of @xmath23 attains a finite value only inside the band gaps where propagation of electromagnetic radiation is prohibited due to the exponential damping .",
    "next , we consider two weakly absorbing materials , say again the same gas and polymer , but now with imaginary contributions to the dielectric functions corresponding to damping parameters @xmath37 . as seen from the corresponding band diagram in fig .  [ fig : bandiag3 ] , the main cause is to smear out the spectrally pronounced dispersion features .",
    "first , it increases @xmath27 from zero to a finite value outside the band gaps and second it smears out the band gap , setting a lower limit on the magnitude of the group velocity .",
    "having treated the simple case of spectrally uniform absorption , we shall now consider a slightly more realistic model for the frequency - dependent absorption in gasses .",
    "due to causality and the kramers  kronig relation , the presence of frequency - dependent absorption is inevitably accompanied by material dispersion in the gas which will play in concert with the waveguide dispersion contributed by the geometry of the bragg stack . to this end",
    ", we will now consider a lorentzian absorption line of the form  @xcite    @xmath38    where the corresponding real part of the dielectric function follows from the kramers  kronig relation and is given by @xmath39    in this model , the strength @xmath40 scales with the concentration of molecules while @xmath41 quantifies the spectral line width around the resonance frequency @xmath42 .",
    "as an example the band diagram for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : banddiag3 ] .",
    "note the zoom - in on the first band gap and the different scale compared to figs .",
    "[ fig : bandiag1 ] and [ fig : bandiag3 ] .",
    "the horizontal dashed black line indicates the above - band - edge position of the absorption line while the yellow shading indicates the band gap for the absorption - free structure .",
    "the red line shows bulk - absorption of the gas itself , thus indicating an absorption enhancement of the order @xmath47 .",
    "we emphasize that this value depends strongly on @xmath10 , @xmath48 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and as we shall see in the next section , even stronger absorption enhancement is possible by carefully tuning the bragg stack parameters to fit the absorption line of interest .",
    "oxygen molecules , o@xmath0 , exhibit a distinctive absorption band in the visible to near - infrared light range at 760  nm , which is called the oxygen a band or the atmospheric transition of oxygen .",
    "these transitions are electric dipole forbidden , so only magnetic transitions are allowed , that require a change in the rotational quantum number of @xmath49 . therefore the a - band splits in to the r - branch ( @xmath50 ) , starting at 759.8  nm with a bandwidth of 2.2  nm and the p - branch ( @xmath51 ) starting at 762.3  nm with a bandwidth of 5.7  nm  @xcite .",
    "though , the a band has a very weak absorption feature , it offers the potential to establish an optical _ in situ _",
    "o@xmath0 detection for a variety of applications , ranging from combustion processes  @xcite and fire research  @xcite to biomedical and environmental systems  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "different spectroscopic methods are used to enlarge the sensitivity of absorption measurements .",
    "folding the laser beam several times in a multi reflection cell or using the long photon life times of high finesse cavities ( cavity ring - down spectroscopy ) offer an enhancement in sensitivity in respect to an enlargement of the absorption path length .",
    "in contrast , the method of slow light enhancement is related to an increased light matter interaction ( though it may be phenomenologically explained as an enlarged effective path length ) , leading to higher absorption cross sections .",
    "this effect offers the potential for micrometer scaled probe volumes which is an important feature for e.g. lab on a chip applications . typically , the absorption of oxygen in ambient air at the 760  nm line is of the order 2.6% with an optical path length of around 1  m  @xcite . at this wavelength , the o@xmath0 absorption spectrum is minimally sensitive towards temperature changes and it is fairly influenced by the pressure variation  @xcite .",
    "the lowest oxygen concentration that can be measured is about 20 - 50  ppm which corresponds to transmission change of about 0.0005  @xcite .",
    "the smallest experimentally detected absorption is about 3 times larger than the shot noise limit and is about @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to a concentration of about 8  ppm at 1  m path length  @xcite .    by extracting the spectroscopic data from the published works  @xcite , we correlated the o@xmath0 absorption coefficient , @xmath5 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : iexp ] ) ] as a function of o@xmath0 concentration @xmath53 in the radiated volume . to lowest order in the gas concentration",
    "we expect that @xmath54 and the linearity of the correlation obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2alpha ] .",
    "the slope of the relatively linear line shows that it is possible to obtain a fairly good measurement of o@xmath0 molecule through the excitation of light at @xmath55 . from a linear fit",
    "we find that @xmath56 .",
    "we note that the different absorption lines in the a - band have different line strengths which may cause the scatter of data in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2alpha ] .",
    "the absorption in pmma , at frequencies around the o@xmath0 a band of oxygen , is fairly constant around @xmath57 m , i.e. of the order of @xmath58 times stronger than the absorption in o@xmath0  @xcite .    for the absorption coefficient in o@xmath0",
    ", we note that the @xmath59 damping over one meter in the framework of eq .",
    "( [ eq : iexp ] ) corresponds to @xmath60 where we have explicitly accounted for the volume fraction of oxygen being @xmath61 in ambient air .",
    "this translates into @xmath62 and for pmma we have @xmath63 while the corresponding dielectric functions are @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "choosing @xmath66 we find that the oxygen a band will be located right next to a band gap edge if we choose @xmath67 , resembling the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : banddiag3 ] . assuming a lorentzian absorption profile and using the method discussed above",
    ", we find that @xmath68 .",
    "we emphasize that the lorentzian linewidth correspond to the complete a band and thus resembles a group of different and even sharper absorption lines , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : o2alpha ] , for which the enhance factor varies .    in a typical beer  lambert experiments measuring the o@xmath0 concentration in the atmosphere , a path length of around 100 cm gives a 2.6% attenuation of the transmitted signal .",
    "the enhanced absorption in the bragg stack discussed above implies that one could scale the path length down by a factor of @xmath69 to about 7  mm while retaining the same absorption signal .",
    "we emphasize that this sensitivity enhancement factor ( effective path length/ real length of the absorber ) is even higher than that of a multi reflection cell , which is limited by reflection losses to about 100 ! very high enhancement factors of 5 orders - of - magnitude or more compared to a single pass setup may be achieved using cavity - enhanced or cavity ringdown laser spectroscopy .",
    "however , such macrooptical setups can hardly be condensed into a microoptical device , and are generally delicate instruments mainly operated in laboratory environments .",
    "using pairs of highly reflecting mirrors with reflectivities exceeding 99.999% , these setups are very sensitive to contamination e.g. by dust . in contrast",
    "the slow - light concept can be considered as a manifold of distributed mirrors .",
    "hopefully , contamination shall not be as detrimental as with the macroscopic cavity approaches . in terms of bandwidth",
    ", the slow - light phenomenon shares physics with the various cavity - based approaches : strong enhancement of the absorption is obtained at the price of a narrow band - width !",
    "slow - light phenomena in photonic crystals has recently been proposed as a mechanism to allow for reduced path length in absorption measurements in microsystems . in this paper",
    "we have considered the effect an absorption line in a gas infiltrating a uniformly absorbing bragg stack .",
    "we have shown that enhanced absorption is possible and as an example we have considered a bragg stack consisting of pmma infiltrated by o@xmath0 . in that case",
    "we have found the absorption enhancement to exceed a factor of @xmath2 potentially allowing for o@xmath0 detection with sub millimeter optical path lengths . for future directions",
    "we emphasize studies of the influence of the interfaces ( scattering loss ) , structural imperfections , and beam divergence in more detail and another natural extension would be planar two - dimensional photonic crystals membranes .",
