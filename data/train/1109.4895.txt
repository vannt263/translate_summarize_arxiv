    "+ the discovery of optical emission extended to kpc scale questions the standard shock acceleration model , suggesting that other efficient mechanisms must take place across the hotspot region . although it may seem an uncommon phenomenon due to the difficulty to produce high - energy electrons on large scales , deep optical images showed that diffuse optical emission is present in a handful of hotspots : 3c33 , 3c111 , 3c303 , 3c351 @xcite , 3c390.3 @xcite , 3c275.1 @xcite , pictor a @xcite , and 3c445 @xcite .",

    "[ eq_trad ] we assume the equipartition magnetic field we find that the radiative ages are just a few years ( table 3 ) . as the hotspots extend over kpc distances , it is indicative that a very efficient re - acceleration mechanism is operating in a similar way over the entire hotspot region . +",
    "the detection of diffuse optical emission occurring well outside the main shock region and distributed over a large fraction of the whole kpc - scale hotspot structure is somewhat surprising .",
    "deep optical observations pointed out that this is a rather common phenomenon detected in about a dozen hotspots ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "first - order fermi acceleration alone can not explain optical emission extending on kpc scale and additional efficient mechanisms taking place away from the main shock region should be considered , unless projection effects play an important role in smearing compact regions where acceleration is still occurring .",
    "+ theoretically , we can consider several scenarios that are able to reproduce the observed extended structures .",
    "( 1 ) one possibility is that a very wide jet , with a size comparable to the hotspot region , impacts simultaneously into various locations across the hotspot generating a complex shocked region that defines an arc - shaped structure .",
    "this , combined with projection effects may explain a wide ( projected ) emitting region .",
    "( 2 ) another possibility is a narrow jet that impacts into the hotspot in a small region where electrons are accelerated at a strong shock . in this case",
    "the accelerated particles are then transported upstream in the hotspot volume where they are continuously re - accelerated by stochastic mechanisms , likely due to turbulence generated by the jet and shock itself .",
    "( 3 ) finally , extended emission may be explained by the `` dentist s drill '' scenario , in which the jet impacts into the hotspot region in different locations at different times .",
    "+ the peculiar morphology and the rather high nir / optical luminosity of 3c105 south and 3c445 south , makes these hotspots ideal targets to investigate the nature of extended diffuse emission . + in 3c105 south",
    ", the detection of optical emission in both primary and secondary hotspots implies that in these regions there is a continuous re - acceleration of particles .",
    "the secondary hotspot s3 could be interpreted as a splatter - spot from material accelerated in the primary one , s2 @xcite .",
    "both the alignment and the distance between these components exclude the jet drilling scenario : the light time between the two components is more than 10@xmath63 years , i.e. much longer than their radiative time ( table 3 ) , suggesting that acceleration is taking place in both s2 and s3 simultaneously .",
    "the secondary hotspot s3 shows some elongation , always in the same direction , in all the radio and optical images with adequate spatial resolution .",
    "this elongation is expected in a splatter - spot and it follows the structure of the shock generated by the impact of the outflow from the primary upon the cocoon wall . +",
    "this scenario , able to explain the presence of optical emission from two bright and distant components , fails in reproducing the diffuse optical emission enshrouding the main features , and the extended tail . in this case , an additional contribution from stochastic mechanisms caused by turbulence in the downstream region is necessary .",
    "although this acceleration mechanism is in general less efficient than fermi - i processes , the ( radiative ) energy losses of particles are smaller in the presence of low magnetic fields , such as those in between s2 and s3 , ( potentially ) allowing stochastic mechanisms to maintain electrons at high energies . + in 3c 445 south",
    "the observational picture is complex .",
    "the optical images of 3c 445 south show a spectacular 10-kpc arc - shape structure .",
    "high resolution hst images allow a further step since they resolve this structure in two elongated components enshrouded by diffuse emission .",
    "these components may mark the regions where a `` dentist s drill '' jet impacts on the ambient medium , representing the most recent episode of shock acceleration due to the jet impact . on the other hand",
    ", they could simply trace the locations of higher particle - acceleration efficiency from a wide / complex interaction between the jet and the ambient medium .",
    "however , the transverse extension , about 1 kpc , of the two elongated components is much larger than what is derived if the relativistic particles , accelerated at the shock , age in the downstream region ( provided that the hotspot advances at typical speeds of 0.05 - 0.1@xmath64 ) .",
    "furthermore , the diffuse optical emission on larger scale suggests the presence of additional , complex , acceleration mechanisms , such as stochastic processes , able to keep particle re - acceleration ongoing in the hotspot region .",
    "the detection of x - ray emission with _",
    "chandra _ adds a new grade of complexity .",
    "this emission and its displacement are interpreted by @xcite as due to ic - cmb originating in the fast part of the decelerating flow .",
    "their model requires that the angle between the jet velocity and the observer s line of sight is small .",
    "however , 3c445 is a classical double radio galaxy and the jet should form a large angle with the line of sight ( see also perlman et al .",
    "2010 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we suggest that the x - ray / optical offset might be the outcome of ongoing efficient particle acceleration occurring in the hotspot region . an evidence supporting this interpretation may reside on the faint and diffuse blob seen in u- and b - bands ( labelled sc in fig .",
    "[ fig_3c445 ] ) just about 1@xmath6 downstream the x - ray peak .",
    "the surface brightness of this component decreases rapidly as the frequency decreases , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3c445 ] : well - detected in u- and b - bands , marginally visible in i - band , and absent at nir and radio wavelengths .",

    "such a hard spectrum is in agreement with ( i ) a very recent episode of particle acceleration ( the radiative cooling time of the emitting particles being 10@xmath65 - 10@xmath62 yr ) ; ( ii ) efficient spatially - distributed acceleration processes , similar to the scenario proposed for the western hotspot of pictor a ( tingay et al .",
    "2008 , see their fig.5 ) .",
    "we presented a multi - band , high spatial resolution study of the hotspot regions in two nearby radio galaxies , namely 3c105 south and 3c445 south , on the basis of radio vla , nir / optical vlt and hst , and x - ray _ chandra _ observations . at the sub - arcsec resolution achieved at radio and optical wavelengths , both hotspots display multiple resolved components connected by diffuse emission detected also in optical .",
    "the hotspot region in 3c105 resolves in three major components : a primary hotspot , unresolved and aligned with the jet direction , and a secondary hotspot , elongated in shape , and interpreted as a splatter - spot arising from continuous outflow of particles from the primary .",
    "such a feature , together with the extremely short radiative ages of the electron populations emitting in the optical , indicates that the jet has been impacting almost in the same position for a long period , making the drilling jet scenario unrealistic .",
    "the detection of an excess of x - ray emission from the northern component of 3c105 south suggests that this region is likely a relativistic knot in the jet rather than a genuine hotspot feature .",
    "the optical diffuse emission enshrouding the main components and extending towards the tail can be explained possibly assuming additional stochastic mechanisms taking place across the whole hotspot region .",
    "+ in the case of 3c445 south the optical observations probe a scenario where the interaction between jet and the ambient medium is very complex .",
    "two optical components pinpointed by hst observations mark either the locations where particle acceleration is most efficient or the remnants of the most recent episodes of acceleration . although projection effects may play an important role , the morphology and the spatial extension of the diffuse optical emission suggest that particle accelerations , such as stochastic mechanisms , add to the standard shock acceleration in the hotspot region .",
    "the x - rays detected by _",
    "chandra _ can not be the counterpart at higher energies of the two main components .",
    "it might be due to ic - cmb from the fast part of a decelerating flow .",
    "alternatively the x - rays could pinpoint synchrotron emission from recent episodes of efficient particle acceleration occurring in the whole hotspot region , similarly to what proposed in other hotspots , that would make the scenario even more complex . a possible evidence supporting this scenario comes from the hard spectrum of the diffuse hotspot emission and from the appearance of a new component ( sc ) in the optical images .",

    "<S> 3c105 south is resolved in two optical components : a primary one , aligned with the jet direction and possibly marking the first jet impact with the surrounding medium , and a secondary , further out from the jet and extended in a direction perpendicular to it . </S>",
    "<S> this secondary region is interpreted as a splatter - spot formed by the deflection of relativistic plasma from the primary hotspot . </S>",
    "<S> radio and optical images of 3c445 south show a spectacular 10-kpc arc - shape structure characterized by two main components , and perpendicular to the jet direction . </S>",
    "<S> hst images in i and b bands further resolve the brightest components into thin elongated features . in both 3c105 south and 3c445 south </S>",
    "<S> the main hotspot components are enshrouded by diffuse optical emission on scale of several kpcs , indicating that very high energy particles , possibly injected at strong shocks , are continuously re - accelerated in situ by additional acceleration mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that stochastic processes , linked to turbulence and instabilities , could provide the required additional re - acceleration .    </S>",
