    "the little higgs model @xcite has been proposed for solving the little hierarchy problem . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs boson is regarded as a pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with a global symmetry at some higher scale . though the symmetry is not exact , its breaking",
    "is specially arranged to cancel quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term at 1-loop level .",
    "this is called the little higgs mechanism . as a result",
    ", the scale of new physics can be as high as 10 tev without a fine - tuning on the higgs mass term . due to the symmetry , the scenario necessitates the introduction of new particles .",
    "in addition , the implementation of the @xmath0 symmetry called t - parity to the model has been proposed in order to avoid electroweak precision measurements @xcite . in this study , we focus on the littlest higgs model with t - parity as a simple and typical example of models implementing both the little higgs mechanism and t - parity .    in order to test the little higgs model , precise determinations of properties of little higgs partners are mandatory , because these particles are directly related to the cancellation of quadratically divergent corrections to the higgs mass term . in particular , measurements of heavy gauge boson masses are quite important . since heavy gauge bosons acquire mass terms through the breaking of the global symmetry , precise measurements of their masses allow us to determine the most important parameter of the model , namely the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the breaking .",
    "furthermore , because the heavy photon is a candidate for dark matter @xcite , the determination of its property gives a great impact not only on particle physics but also on astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the properties of heavy gauge bosons at the large hadron collider , because they have no color charge @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the ilc will provide an ideal environment to measure the properties of heavy gauge bosons .",
    "we study the sensitivity of the measurements to the little higgs parameters at the ilc based on a realistic monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "we have used madgraph @xcite and physsim @xcite to generate signal and standard model ( sm ) events , respectively . in this study , we have also used pythia6.4 @xcite , tauola @xcite and jsfquicksimulator which implements the gld geometry and other detector - performance related parameters @xcite .",
    "the littlest higgs model with t - parity is based on a non - linear sigma model describing an su(5)/so(5 ) symmetry breaking with a vev , @xmath1 tev .",
    "an [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 subgroup in the su(5 ) is gauged , which is broken down to the sm gauge group su(2)@xmath4u(1)@xmath5 . due to the presence of the gauge and yukawa interactions , the su(5 ) global symmetry",
    "is not exact .",
    "the sm doublet and triplet higgs bosons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) arise as pseudo ng bosons in the model .",
    "the triplet higgs boson is t - odd , while the sm higgs is t - even .",
    "this model contains gauge fields of the gauged [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 symmetry ; the linear combinations @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the sm gauge bosons for the su(2)@xmath10 and u(1)@xmath5 symmetries .",
    "the other linear combinations @xmath11 and @xmath12 are additional gauge bosons called heavy gauge bosons , which acquire masses of @xmath13 through the su(5)/so(5 ) symmetry breaking . after the electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the neutral components of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are mixed with each other and form mass eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the heavy gauge bosons ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) behave as t - odd particles , while sm gauge bosons are t - even .    to implement t - parity , two su(2 ) doublets @xmath19 and @xmath20 are introduced for each sm lepton .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath19 and @xmath20 under the gauged [ su(2)@xmath2u(1)]@xmath3 symmetry are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the linear combination @xmath23 gives the left - handed sm lepton . on the other hand , another linear combination @xmath24 is vector - like t - odd partner which acquires the mass of @xmath13 .",
    "the masses depend on the @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , new particles are also introduced in quark sector .",
    "( for details , see ref .",
    "the representative point used in our simulation study is @xmath27 @xmath28 ( 580 gev , 134 gev , 1.5 , 0.5 ) where ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) @xmath28 ( 81.9 gev , 368 gev , 369 gev , 440 gev ) and @xmath33 is an additional yukawa coupling in the top sector .",
    "the model parameter satisfies not only the current electroweak precision data but also the wmap observation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , no fine - tuning is needed at the sample point to keep the higgs mass on the electroweak scale @xcite .    in the model , there are four processes whose final states consist of two heavy gauge bosons : @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the first process is undetectable . at the representative point",
    ", the largest cross section is expected for the fourth process , which is open at @xmath39 tev . on the other hand , because @xmath40 is less than 500 gev , the second process is important already at the @xmath41 gev .",
    "we , hence , concentrate on @xmath42 at @xmath41 gev and @xmath43 at @xmath44 tev .",
    "feynman diagrams for the signal processes are shown in fig .",

    "deviations from the best fit point in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 mass plane , and ( b ) 1- , 3- , and 5-@xmath45 deviations in the @xmath16 and @xmath18 mass plane .",
    "the shaded area in ( a ) shows the unphysical region of @xmath46 gev.,width=377 ]    for the @xmath47 production at @xmath41 gev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath48 , we define @xmath49 as our signal event .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 boson masses can be estimated from the edges of the distribution of the reconstructed higgs boson energies .",
    "the endpoints have been estimated by fitting the distribution with a line shape determined by a high statistics signal sample .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath29 and @xmath31 being @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev , respectively .    for the @xmath52 production at @xmath44 tev with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath48",
    ", we have used 4-jet final states , @xmath53 .",
    "the masses of @xmath16 and @xmath18 bosons can be determined from the edges of the @xmath54 energy distribution .",
    "the fitted masses of @xmath55 and @xmath56 bosons are @xmath57 gev and @xmath58 gev , respectively . using the process",
    ", it is also possible to confirm that the spin of @xmath59 is consistent with one and the polarization of @xmath60 from the @xmath59 decay is dominantly longitudinal .",
    "furthermore , the gauge charges of the @xmath18 boson could be also measured using a polarized electron beam .",
    "figure [ fig : cntr ] shows the probability contours for the masses of @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath61 tev together with that of @xmath16 and @xmath17 at 500 gev .",
    "the mass resolution improves dramatically at @xmath62 tev , compared to that at @xmath41 gev .",
    "the littlest higgs model with t - parity is one of the attractive candidates for physics beyond the sm .",
    "we have shown that the masses of the heavy gauge bosons can be determined very accurately at the ilc .",
    "it is important to notice that these masses are obtained in a model - independent way , so that it is possible to test the little higgs model by comparing them with the theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore , since the masses of the heavy gauge bosons are determined by the vev @xmath63 , it is possible to accurately determine @xmath63 . from the results obtained in our simulation study , it turns out that the vev @xmath63 can be determined to accuracies of 4.3% at @xmath64 500 gev and 0.1% at @xmath64 1 tev .",
    "another little higgs parameter @xmath25 could also be estimated from production cross sections for the heavy gauge bosons , because the cross sections depend on the masses of heavy leptons . at the ilc with @xmath64 500 gev and 1 tev ,",
    "@xmath25 could be obtained within 9.5% and 0.8% accuracies , respectively .",
    "finally , we have also found that the thermal abundance of dark matter relics can be determined to 10% and 1% levels at @xmath64 500 gev and @xmath64 1 tev , respectively .",
    "these accuracies are comparable to those of current and future cosmological observations such as the planck satellite @xcite , implying that the ilc experiment will play an essential role to understand the thermal history of our universe .",
