    "the lsnd experiment has found evidence for @xmath0 oscillations at the @xmath2 level  @xcite , with indications for @xmath3 oscillations at lesser significance  @xcite . the combination of the lsnd data with the compelling evidence for oscillations in solar , atmospheric , accelerator , and reactor neutrino experiments can not be adequately explained in the standard three - neutrino picture with @xmath1 conservation  @xcite .",
    "extensions to models with four light neutrinos ( with the extra neutrino being sterile )  @xcite or @xmath1 violation  @xcite with three neutrinos have been proposed to accommodate all neutrino data . however , in both cases , recent analyses indicate that neither scenario provides a good description of the data  @xcite .",
    "the miniboone experiment  @xcite is now taking data that will test the lsnd oscillation parameters data from lsnd and karmen  @xcite and @xmath4 data from the bugey reactor experiment  @xcite , lies in a narrow band in @xmath5 space along the line described approximately by @xmath6 between @xmath7 and 1  ev@xmath8 .",

    "a positive result in miniboone will rule out current versions of @xmath1-violating models , while a negative result will rule out four - neutrino models with @xmath1 conservation . in either case",

    "in this letter we consider the very speculative possibility of _",
    "@xmath1 violation in four - neutrino models_. the @xmath1 violation is manifested as different mass matrices for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "we find that such a scenario can accommodate the data only if the sterile neutrino is weakly coupled to active neutrinos .",
    "thus , while 3  +  1 models are viable , 2  +  2 models ( in which the sterile neutrino is strongly coupled to active neutrinos in solar and/or atmospheric oscillations ) , are not . a hybrid solution ( 3  +  1 for neutrinos and 2  +  2 for antineutrinos ) is also possible",
    "there are two types of four - neutrino models : ( a ) 3  +  1 , where active neutrinos have mass - squared differences and mixings similar to the standard three - neutrino model that describes solar and atmospheric data , and ( b ) 2  +  2 , where there are two pairs of closely spaced mass eigenstates , one of which accounts for the solar neutrino data and the other for the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the 3  +  1 models with @xmath1 conservation are disfavored because the bugey reactor  @xcite and cdhsw accelerator  @xcite experiments put constraints on oscillation amplitudes for @xmath12 and @xmath13 survival , respectively , which together imply an upper limit on the lsnd oscillation amplitude that is below the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "the 2  +  2 models with @xmath1 conservation are ruled out because the combination of solar and atmospheric data do not allow enough room for a full sterile neutrino  @xcite . to resurrect the scenario in which sterile and active states are only weakly coupled ,",
    "it has been shown that extending 3  +  1 models by an extra sterile neutrino improves the fit to short - baseline data substantially  @xcite .",
    "the constraints on 2  +  2 models may be relaxed by including certain small neglected mixing angles in the analysis  @xcite .",

    ", the antineutrino mass - squared differences were adjusted to account for the lsnd and kamland oscillations ( but not oscillations of atmospheric antineutrinos )  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the atmospheric data showed that the modified @xmath1-violating model did not give a good fit and is excluded at the @xmath16 level  @xcite .",
    "thus , neither four - neutrino models with @xmath1 conservation nor three - neutrino models with @xmath1 violation provides a consistent explanation of all the data including lsnd .",

    "we will assume that there are three different mass - squared difference scales for neutrinos , @xmath24 , that can explain the solar , atmospheric and lsnd data , respectively , and that the corresponding mass - squared differences for antineutrinos are similar to those for neutrinos , _",

    "[ fig:3 + 1nubar],width=307 ]    we note that fits for neutrinos and antineutrinos no longer must agree , so that , _ e.g. _ , the solar fits are now independent of the kamland fits . thus , any differences that might occur between the kamland and solar neutrino allowed regions could be explained by @xmath1 violation .",
    "similarly , results for atmospheric neutrinos and antineutrinos ( which could perhaps be measured separately in minos  @xcite ) could also be different and still be easily accommodated in the model .",
    "on the other hand , if there were no discernible difference between the neutrino and antineutrino fits to solar , kamland , and atmospheric data , the amount of @xmath1 violation needed would be small , since then the only differences between neutrino and antineutrino parameters would occur in the small mixings between the sterile and the active states .      constraints on 2  +  2 models are different from those on the 3  +  1 models because they have different expressions for the oscillation probabilities .",

    "we have argued that a four - neutrino model with @xmath1 violation can provide an explanation of all neutrino oscillation data if the neutrino sector has a 3  +  1 structure and the antineutrino sector is either 3  +  1 or 2  +  2 ; a 2  +  2 structure is not allowed in the neutrino sector . if the antineutrino sector is 3  +  1 , then @xmath75 must be near 1 or 7  ev@xmath8 , while if it is 2  +  2 , the entire range of @xmath75 allowed by lsnd , karmen and bugey is possible .    a detection of @xmath3 oscillations by miniboone with parameters above the solid line in fig .",
