    "the gut framework is especially compelling in that electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is easily induced at a scale @xmath7 as the soft mass - squared of the higgs field that couples to the top quark is driven to small ( sometimes negative ) values by the associated large yukawa coupling during evolution to low energy scales .",
    "thus , it is important to consider the implications of gut scenarios for the detection of the higgs bosons of the mssm and to determine the extent to which ( and strategies by which ) higgs boson decay branching fractions can be measured with accuracy sufficient to constrain gut models .",

    ". this @xmath14 value must agree with that determined from the masses .",

    "event rate contours as a function of parameter space location are presented for the six gut models . in section 4 ,",
    "we determine the prospects for measuring the branching fractions for various higgs boson decays , including those for specific supersymmetric ( susy ) sparticle pairs .",
    "the ability to discriminate between different gut models and to determine the parameter space location within the correct gut model on the basis of higgs decays is delineated .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results and conclusions .",
    "in the simplest gut treatments of the mssm , soft supersymmetry breaking at the gut scale is specified by three universal parameters :    * @xmath64 : the universal soft scalar mass ; * @xmath65 : the universal soft gaugino mass ; * @xmath66 : the universal soft yukawa coefficient .",

    "( the pole gluino mass is generally substantially larger than @xmath75 when squark masses are large . )",
    "we will consider three representative gut scenarios characterized by increasingly large values of @xmath64 relative to @xmath65 ( which translates into increasingly large slepton masses as compared to @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ) :    * `` no - scale '' ( ns ) @xcite : @xmath80 ; * `` dilaton '' ( d ) @xcite : @xmath81 ; * `` heavy - scalar '' ( hs ) : @xmath82 , @xmath83 .    within any one of these three scenarios ,",

    "one finds that for large enough @xmath65 the upper bound drops below the lower bound . * the upper bound on @xmath14 as a function of @xmath65 in the d scenario comes from demanding that the lsp not be charged . * in the hs scenario , the upper bound on @xmath14 arises by requiring that the sm - like light higgs mass lie above the current limit of @xmath90 .",
    "( in the hs scenario , for fixed @xmath65 , @xmath13 becomes smaller and smaller as @xmath14 increases until eventually it approaches zero forcing @xmath17 to decline rapidly .",

    "high @xmath65 values ( roughly , @xmath91 @xcite ) are , however , disfavored by naturalness considerations .    before proceeding , we provide a few technical notes .",
    "first , we note that the evolution equations must be implemented very carefully when considering very large @xmath13 values . in order to avoid instabilities deriving from unnaturally large ( and hence unreliable ) one - loop corrections ( for going from running masses to pole masses ) , we found it necessary to terminate evolution for soft masses at scales of order the associated final physical squark , slepton and heavy higgs masses . in this way ,",

    "in this paper , we have considered detecting and studying the heavy higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric model when pair produced in @xmath2 or @xmath3 collisions .",
    "we have shown that , in the susy gut models studied , the target luminosities of @xmath144 and @xmath146 at @xmath145 and @xmath55 , respectively , will allow detection of @xmath58 and @xmath59 pair production throughout essentially all of the model parameter space which is allowed by theoretical and kinematic constraints , despite the presence of susy decay modes of the @xmath61 at a significant level .",

    "we find that the measured higgs masses and relative branching fractions , in combination with direct measurements of the chargino and neutralino masses , will over - constrain and very strongly limit the possible susy gut models .",
    "the specific susy gut models considered are moderately conservative in that they are characterized by universal boundary conditions . in all",
    ", we delineated expectations for six different models , requiring correct electroweak symmetry breaking via evolution from the gut scale to @xmath68 . for each model",
    ", there are only two parameters : @xmath65 ( the universal gaugino ) mass ; and @xmath14 ( the usual higgs field vacuum expectation value ratio ) .",
    "each model is characterized by a definite relation of the universal soft - susy - breaking scalar mass , @xmath64 , and the universal mixing parameter , @xmath66 , to @xmath65 , as well as by a choice for the sign of @xmath67 ( the higgs superfield mixing coefficient ) .",
    "the strategy for checking the consistency of a given gut hypothesis is straightforward .",
    "first , the measured @xmath11 , neutralino and chargino masses are , in almost all cases , already sufficient to determine the @xmath65 and @xmath14 values required in the given gut scenario with good precision .",
    "the value of @xmath14 so obtained should agree with that determined from chargino pair production rates .",
    "the higgs sector branching fractions can then be predicted and become an important testing ground for the consistency of the proposed gut hypothesis as well as for testing the mssm two - doublet higgs sector structure per se .    within the list of ratios of branching fractions given in eqs .",
    "( [ hhhasusy])-([hazhl ] ) and ( [ hphmsusy])-([hpwhl ] ) , the average . ]",
    "@xmath297 , the @xmath298 and the @xmath299 branching fractions typically fix a relatively precise location in @xmath84 parameter space .",
    "these values can be compared to those required by the @xmath13 and @xmath93 mass measurements .",
    "consistency within experimental errors is typically only possible for a small set of closely related models . in the sample situation",
    "detailed in section 4 , where we assumed that one of the six gut models was correct and computed statistical errors on that basis , only one of the remaining five models could possibly be confused with the input model after measuring the above three branching fractions relative to that for the final state used for tagging . by subdividing the susy signal into final states with a definite number of leptons and any number of jets , and considering as well the @xmath208 , @xmath112 and @xmath274 branching fractions",
    ", we found it possible to distinguish between these two choices at a very substantial statistical level .",
    "thus , a unique model among the six rather similar models is singled out by combining measurements from the higgs sector with those from conventional susy pair production . in short , measurements deriving from pair production of higgs particles",
    "can have a great impact upon our ability to experimentally determine the correct susy gut model .",
    "the above discussion has left aside the fact that for universal soft - scalar masses the measured value of the slepton mass would determine the relative magnitude of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "of the two models mentioned just above , one has a large @xmath300 value and the other a much smaller value .",
    "they could be easily distinguished on the basis of @xmath301 alone .",
    "however , if the soft - scalar slepton mass is not the same as the soft - scalar higgs field masses at the gut scale , the branching fraction ratios would give the best indication of the relative size of the soft - scalar higgs mass as compared to @xmath65 .",
    "more information regarding the slepton / sneutrino mass scale and additional ability to discrminate between models are both realized by subdividing the susy decays of the higgs bosons in a way that is sensitive to the relative branching fractions for slepton / sneutrino vs. chargino / neutralino decays .",
    "slepton / sneutrino channels essentially only produce leptons in the final state , whereas the jet component is typically larger than the leptonic component for chargino / neutralino decays ( other than the totally invisible @xmath302 mode ) .",
    "thus , we are able to define individual susy channels , characterized by a certain number of leptons and/or jets , which display a strong correlation with the slepton / sneutrino decay component .",
    "we find that these individual channels have sufficiently large event rates that the ratios of the branching fractions for these channels can typically be determined with reasonable statistical precision .",
    "for the earlier - mentioned input model , we can compute the statistical level at which the other five gut scenarios would be ruled out using various of these ratios of branching fractions .",
    "excellent discrimination between models on this basis is found .    in conclusion",
    ", our study shows that not only will detection of higgs pair production in @xmath2 or @xmath3 collisions ( at planned luminosities ) be possible for most of the kinematically accessible portion of parameter space in a typical gut model , but also the detailed rates for and ratios of different neutral and charged higgs decay final states will very strongly constrain the choice of gut - scale boundary conditions . in estimating experimental sensitivity for higgs pair detection and for measuring higgs masses and branching fractions , we included substantial inefficiencies and all relevant branching fractions .",
    "although we believe that our estimates are relatively conservative , it will be important to re - visit this analysis using a full monte carlo detector simulation .",
