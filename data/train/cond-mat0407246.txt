    "high molecular weight polymers are extremely surface - active molecules .",
    "even a weak interaction between a single monomer and a surface tends to be magnified into a powerful attraction or repulsion when many of these monomers are linked together to form a polymeric chain .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that surfaces contacting even extremely dilute polymer solutions can readily develop very dense polymer layers .",
    "technologies revolving around the properties of either synthetic or biological polymer layers are many and varied , including adhesion @xcite , coating @xcite , colloid stabilization @xcite , fiber reinforced thermoplastics @xcite , flocculation processes @xcite , dna microaarrays @xcite and biocompatibilization @xcite . motivated both by fundamental questions and by technology , understanding and predicting the structure and formation kinetics of these soft layers is a major concern of polymer science @xcite .",
    "a crucial aspect of experimental studies is that adsorbed polymer dynamics are typically extremely slow for long chains : an individual chain has many surface stickers and interacts with numerous other chains impeding its motion .",
    "irreversibility and non - equilibrium effects are therefore very common .",
    "the subject of this review is experimental and theoretical work on these non - equilibrium effects , and though we consider adsorption from dilute solutions , semi - dilute solutions and melts our main emphasis is neutral homopolymer adsorption from dilute solutions .",
    "this is the simplest and most widely studied class .",
    "polymer - surface adsorption systems are naturally classified according to the mode of adsorption . roughly , there are two classes : chemisorption and physisorption ( see ) .",
    "the clearest example of irreversibility arises in _ chemisorption _ ( ( b ) ) where the covalent polymer - surface bonds which develop are often essentially irreversible on experimental timescales .",
    "monomer sticking free energies , @xmath3 , have values typical of covalent bonds which are one to two orders of magnitude greater than @xmath0 .",
    "chemical adsorption is employed in various technologies where polymers are attached by chemical reactions to solid surfaces either from a polymer melt as in the reinforcement of polymer - polymer or polymer - solid interfaces @xcite , or from solution as in colloid stabilization by chemically grafting polymers onto particle surfaces @xcite .",
    "what is less obvious is why non - equilibrium effects are so widely observed in _ physisorbing _",
    "systems , even for rather weak sticking energies .",
    "available experimental evidence suggests that irreversibility effects become important as soon as @xmath3 becomes somewhat larger than @xmath0 .",
    "for example the experiments by schneider et al .",
    "@xcite for polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) adsorption onto oxidized silica via hydrogen bonding in dilute ccl@xmath4 solutions ( @xmath5 ) show essentially frozen - in adsorbed chain configurations .",
    "large physisorption sticking energies ( @xmath6 ) originate in hydrogen bonding or other dipolar forces , dispersion forces or attractions between charged groups .",
    "metal and silicon - based surfaces are usually oxidized and many polymer species form strong hydrogen bonds with the surface oxygen or silanol groups @xcite .",
    "biopolymers such as proteins and dna attach tenaciously to many surfaces due to their many charged , polar and hydrophobic groups @xcite . since hydrogen bonds , for instance , typically have energies of several @xmath0 @xcite it is apparent that strong physical bonds are very common .",
    "this suggests that whether physical or chemical bonding is involved , for long chains irreversible effects may in practice be the rule rather than the exception .    to understand non - equilibrium layers",
    ", one must identify how they differ from equilibrium layers .",
    "the theory of fully equilibrated layers is far more advanced , at both the mean - field @xcite and scaling @xcite level of description .",
    "a main result of these theories is expressions for the decay of the monomer density profile as a function of the distance @xmath7 from the surface .",
    "for adsorption from dilute solutions for example , in the scaling picture originally developed by de gennes @xcite , eisenriegler et al .",
    "@xcite , and de gennes and pincus @xcite , each adsorbed chain has sequences of surface - bound monomers ( trains ) interspersed with portions extending away from the surface ( tails and loops of size @xmath8 ) with distribution @xmath9 @xcite leading to a self - similar density profile @xmath10 .",
    "experimentally , the existence of an extended diffuse layer is well established by a large number of neutron scattering @xcite and neutron reflectivity @xcite studies .",
    "however a universally accepted quantitative test of the predicted density profiles has been difficult to achieve , both due to intrinsic limitations of the experimental techniques @xcite and to the asymptotic nature of many of the theoretical results which are valid in the limit of very long chains .",
    "furthermore , for experiments specifically directed at equilibrium , ensuring that equilibrium conditions are realised is difficult when the very non - equilibrium effects one wishes to avoid are poorly identified .    understanding the origin of the observed deviations from equilibrium for weakly adsorbing systems in dilute solutions is a major unresolved puzzle in polymer science . at present",
    "it is unclear how universal these non - equilibrium effects may be .",
    "various effects have been speculated to play important roles .",
    "kremer @xcite and de gennes @xcite have suggested that if the solution temperature is below the polymer melt glass transition temperature , glassy effects may onset at the interface where polymer densities are similar to those of melts .",
    "interactions with the surface might further enhance glassiness .",
    "chakraborty and coworkers @xcite suggested flattened - down chains experience strong kinetic barriers due to local steric constraints which drastically slow down dynamics .",
    "ideas related to slow cooperative motions , mutual pinning , development of entanglements at the interface and crystalization have been proposed by johner and semenov @xcite , sommer @xcite , granick @xcite and raviv et el .",

    ", our aim is to ( i ) assemble and classify a number of theoretical ideas and numerical simulations which articulate the community s current level of understanding of equilibrium and non - equilibrium polymer adsorption , and ( ii ) summarize a number of experimental results which we believe are particularly pertinent and which still demand a theoretical explanation .",
    "the emphasis is on the simplest case : adsorption of neutral flexible polymers from dilute bulk solutions .",
    "we also review work on irreversible adsorption from semi - dilute bulk solutions and melts , motivated by ideas initiated by guiselin @xcite .",
    "polyelectrolyte solutions , polymers with complex architectures and non - flat surfaces are beyond the scope of the present review .",
    "physisorption and chemisorption will be carefully distinguished .",
    "these are characterized by very different values of the local monomer - surface association rate , @xmath11 ( see ) . in physisorption ,",
    "monomer attachment is usually essentially diffusion - limited , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is monomer relaxation time and @xmath14 is a system - dependent constant of order unity @xcite .",
    "chemisorption is normally much slower @xcite with @xmath11 values typically 8 or more orders of magnitude smaller than those of physisorption .",
    "the origin of this difference is that chemical bond formation usually involves a large activation barrier ( see ) .",
    "similarly , desorption rates after chemisorption are usually very small and can be ignored .",
    "the effect of desorption on physisorbing systems is more subtle and is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the above two classes naturally lead to very different adsorption kinetics .",
    "this is analogous to _ bulk _ polymer - polymer reaction kinetics where depending on @xmath11 , polymer length @xmath15 , and solvent conditions ,",
    "the kinetics are described by one of a range of `` diffusion - controlled '' and `` mean - field '' kinetic regimes @xcite .",
    "such regimes also arise for end - adsorbing polymers @xcite .    in section 2 we briefly review the equilibrium picture for dilute solutions and in section 3 we discuss experimental evidence for non - equilibrium departures from this picture .",

    "we remark that the net monomer free energy of adsorption @xmath3 includes both the `` stickiness '' a monomer feels for the surface , but also the entropic disadvantage due to constraining local orientational degrees of freedom upon contact with the surface .",
