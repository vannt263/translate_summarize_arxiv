    "boolean networks have been used to represent a network of interacting agents as follows .",
    "a network of @xmath4 automata has a state @xmath5 , represented by a boolean variable @xmath6 on each automaton @xmath7 , which evolves according to a deterministic function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the update of the local state @xmath6 .",
    "boolean networks have been used to model gene networks @xcite , neural networks @xcite , social interactions @xcite and more ( see @xcite ) .",
    "their natural generalisation where each variable @xmath6 can take more than two values in some finite alphabet @xmath1 has been investigated since this can be a more accurate representation of the phenomenon we are modelling @xcite .",
    "the structure of a network @xmath10 can be represented via its interaction graph @xmath11 , which indicates which update functions depend on which variables .",
    "more formally , @xmath11 has @xmath12 as vertex set and there is an arc from @xmath13 to @xmath7 if @xmath14 depends essentially on @xmath15 .",
    "the arcs of the interaction graph can also be signed , where the sign of @xmath16 indicates whether the local function @xmath14 is an increasing ( positive sign ) , decreasing ( negative sign ) , or non - monotone ( zero sign ) function of @xmath15 .",
    "this is commonly the case when studying gene networks , where a gene can typically either activate ( positive sign ) or inhibit ( negative sign ) another gene . in this biological context",
    ", the interaction graph is known  or at least well approximated , while the actual update functions are not .",
    "the main problem of research on ( non - necessarily boolean ) networks is then to predict their dynamics according to their interaction graphs .    among the many dynamical properties that can be studied ,",
    "fixed points are crucial because they represent stable states ; for instance , in the context of gene networks , they correspond to stable patterns of gene expression at the basis of particular biological processes . as such , they are arguably the property which has been the most thoroughly studied .",
    "the study of the number of fixed points and its maximisation in particular is the subject of a stream of work , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "a lot of literature is devoted to determining when a boolean network admits multiple fixed points ( see @xcite for a survey ) .    for the maximum number of fixed points with a given signed interaction graph",
    ", however , a wide gap remains between the best lower bounds and upper bounds known so far .",
    "the first result in this area , proposed by thomas @xcite , is that networks whose interaction graphs do not have a positive cycle ( i.e. a cycle with an even number of negative arcs ) have at most one fixed point .",
    "this was then generalised into an upper bound on the number of fixed points of boolean networks : a network has at most @xmath17 fixed points , where @xmath18 is the minimum size of a positive feedback vertex set of its interaction graph @xcite .",
    "this upper bound was then refined via the use of local graphs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a positive cycle admits a boolean network with @xmath19 fixed points . a network with a large number of fixed points for a general signed digraph is then obtained by packing positive cycles ; if @xmath2 has @xmath20 disjoint positive cycles , then the network has @xmath21 fixed points .",
    "this result is folklore and is the best known by the authors .",
    "all these results tend to suggest that positive cycles in the interaction graph produce a high number of fixed points .",
    "a completely different approach has been developed for unsigned digraphs in the context of network coding @xcite .",
    "network coding is a technique to transmit information through networks , which can significantly improve upon routing in theory @xcite . at each intermediate node @xmath22 ,",
    "the received messages @xmath23 are combined , and the combined message @xmath24 is then forwarded towards its destination .",
    "the main problem is to determine which functions can transmit the most information . in particular , the network coding solvability problem tries to determine whether a certain network situation , with a given set of sources , destinations , and messages , is _ solvable _ ,",
    "i.e. whether all messages can be transmitted to their destinations .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the solvability problem can be recast in terms of fixed points of ( non - necessarily boolean ) networks .",
    "the so - called guessing number @xcite of a digraph @xmath2 is the logarithm of the maximum number of fixed points over all networks @xmath3 whose interaction graph is a subgraph of @xmath2 : @xmath25 .",
    "then , a network coding instance is solvable if some digraph @xmath2 related to the instance admits a network with guessing number equal to the size of the minimum feedback vertex set . the guessing number approach is further developed in @xcite , where the so - called guessing graph is introduced .",
    "this technique then completely omits the local update functions and instead turns the problem of maximising fixed points into a purely coding theoretic problem . based on this approach , numerous upper and lower bounds on the guessing number of unsigned digraphs",
    "have been derived ( see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we generalise and adapt the techniques developed from network coding and coding theory to tackle the problem of maximising fixed points for signed digraphs .",
    "firstly , we generalise the concept of guessing graph to all signed digraphs in theorem [ th : g = alpha ] .",
    "this approach is valid for all alphabet sizes , and immediately yields two new lower bounds on the guessing number of signed digraphs ( in theorems [ th : bound_g1 ] and [ th : bound_g2 ] , respectively ) .",
    "secondly , we discover several relationships between fixed points of networks defined on signed digraphs and codes correcting asymmetric errors @xcite .",
    "based on these relationships , we then obtain much stronger ( upper and lower ) bounds on the number of fixed points via bounds on codes for asymmetric errors in theorems [ th : g < a ] and [ th : g > a ] .",
    "these relationships , and the fact that they are so fruitful , are slightly counter - intuitive because the vast majority of error - correcting codes are linear , and hence involve linear functions over finite fields , which are not monotonous and thus can not be used for signed digraphs .",
    "more strikingly , we obtain our tightest bounds for digraphs in which all the arcs are signed positively , and hence where all the local update functions are monotonically increasing ( see theorem [ th : g < a ] for instance ) .",
    "this illustrates the versatility of the whole guessing number approach",
    ".    our results also illustrate some different behaviour which occurs only for signed digraphs .",
    "indeed , we discover a digraph for which the guessing number over any finite alphabet of size @xmath26 is higher than the limit of the guessing number when @xmath27 tends to infinity .",
    "this is unlike the unsigned case where the limit is always the supremum over all finite alphabets .",
    "finally , by comparing the numbers of fixed points for the negative clique and the positive clique , we then show that positive cycles are not necessarily useful in order to create many fixed points .",
    "indeed , we exhibit two signed digraphs @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath28 has more positive cycles and more disjoint positive cycles than @xmath29 , and yet @xmath29 has a higher guessing number .",
    "this goes against the common view described above , and is actually akin to a result in @xcite on the number of fixed points of conjunctive networks , which is maximised for a disjoint union of negative triangles ( see section [ sec : positive ] for a more elaborate discussion ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : guessing ] first reviews some concepts on signed digraphs , and then introduces their guessing numbers and their guessing graphs . based on the guessing graph",
    ", it then derives some lower bounds on the guessing number .",
    "section [ sec : ecc_signed ] determines different relationships between codes for the asymmetric channel and sets of fixed points and obtains more bounds on the guessing number .",
    "section [ sec : positive ] then investigates the guessing number of signed cliques . finally , section [ sec : comparison_bounds ] compares the different bounds we have derived in the earlier sections .",
