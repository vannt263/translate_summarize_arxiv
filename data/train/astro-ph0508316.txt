    "constrains specific inflationary models , as well as enhances our understanding of the secondary processes the cmb underwent beyond the surface of last scattering .",
    "interpretation of any such measurement is complicated by the fact that systematics and foreground contaminations might also produce non - gaussian signatures .",
    "given the nearly gaussian nature of the cmb , @xmath0-point correlation functions , and their harmonic counterparts , polyspectra , are the most natural tools for the perturbative understanding of non - gaussianity .",
    "if it were generated by inflationary models admitting a @xmath7 term , the leading order effect would be a @xmath8-point function .",
    "on the other hand some secondary anisotropies , such as lensing , are known to produce 4-point non - gaussianity at leading order @xcite .",
    "the skewness ( or integrated bispectrum ) was measured by @xcite and @xmath8-point correlation function by @xcite .",
    "many alternative statistics have been used to investigate non - gaussianity in cmb .",
    "a partial list includes wavelet coefficients @xcite , minkowski functionals @xcite , phase correlations between spherical harmonic coefficients @xcite , multipole alignment statistics @xcite , statistics of hot and cold spots @xcite , higher criticism statistic of pixel values directly @xcite .",
    "most of these measurements are consistent with gaussianity , although some claim detections of non - gaussianity up to 3-@xmath3 level .",
    "these alternative statistics , albeit often easier to measure , typically depend on @xmath0-point functions in a complex way , thus they can not pin - point as precisely the source of non - gaussianity .    among the three - point statistics , there is a perceived complementarity between harmonic and real space methods .",
    "the bispectrum can be relatively easily calculated for a full sky map @xcite , although the present methods have a somewhat slow @xmath9 scaling @xcite .",
    "methods put forward so far use the `` pseudo - bispectrum '' , ignoring the convolution with the complicated geometry induced by galactic cut and cut - out holes .",
    "in contrast with harmonic space , the corresponding pixel space edge effect corrections are trivial @xcite , since the window function is diagonal .",
    "unfortunately , simple methods to measure three - point clustering exhibit a prohibitive @xmath2 scaling if the full configuration space is scanned .",
    "to remedy the situation , most previous measurements of the @xmath8-point function only deal with an ad - hoc sub - set of triangular configurations @xcite .",
    "both of these papers covered the full configuration space on small scales ; the former paper also appears to have estimated most configurations on large scales , missing intermediate configurations with mixes scales .",
    "this work presents a novel method , which , at a given resolution , scans the full available configuration space for @xmath8-point level statistics using realistic computational resources .",
    "we find that the resulting configuration space itself is overwhelming to such a degree that interpretation of the results also requires novel methods .",
    "we introduce false discovery rate ( fdr ) technique as a tool to interpret three - point correlation function measurements .",
    "the next section introduces our algorithm to measure the @xmath8-point correlation function , ",
    "3 illustrates it with an application to the wmap first year data release , and  4 introduces the fdr method and applies it to our results .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in  5 .",
    "the three point correlation function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is defined as a joint moment of three density fields @xmath10 at three spatial positions . for cmb studies",
    "@xmath11 denotes temperature fluctuations at position @xmath12 on the sky , and @xmath13 stands for ensemble average . if the underlying distribution is spatially isotropic , @xmath14 will only depend on the shape and size of a ( spherical ) triangle arising from the three positions .",
    "a number of characterizations of this triangle are possible and convenient .",
    "the most widely used are the sizes of its sides ( measured in radians ) , or two sizes and the angle between them .",
    "this latter angle is measured on the spherical surface of the sky .",
    "one can use the ergodic principle of replacing ensemble averages with spatial averages to construct a nearly optimal , edge corrected estimators with heuristic weights @xcite @xmath15 where we symbolically denoted a particular triangular configuration with @xmath16 ( any parametrization would suffice ) , and @xmath17 if pixels @xmath18 , and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "we also defined a multiplicative weight @xmath20 for each pixel : this is @xmath19 if a pixel is masked out , and it could take various convenient values depending on our noise weighting scheme if the pixel is inside the survey ; e.g. , in the case of flat weights it is simply @xmath21 .",
    "this simple estimator has been widely used in large scale structure , and it is nearly optimal with appropriate weights .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is entirely analogous to the successful estimators used for the measurements of the @xmath22 s for the cmb ( up to harmonic transform , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the naive realization of equation  [ eq : estimator ] has a prohibitive @xmath2 scaling if one needs to scan through triplets of pixels and assign them to a particular bin .",
    "the summation can be restricted and thus made faster if one restricts the number of configurations and the resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or it can be sped up by using tree - data structures @xcite .",
    "neither of these methods is able to scan through all possible configurations in megapixel maps with reasonable amount of computing resources .",
    "here we propose a new method which uses both hierarchical pixelization and fourier methods motivated by @xcite to scan through all the triangles simultaneously .",
    "note that @xcite comes closest to our aims , but their simple two - step approach is not systematic enough to cover all possible triangles at a given resolution , and it is not fast enough for massive monte carlo simulations .    in the following",
    "we will choose a parametrization of the triangle @xmath16 using two of its sides @xmath23 , and the angle @xmath24 between them .",
    "we define the configuration space as a set of ( logarithmic ) bins for the sides , and linear bins for the angle in their full possible range , i.e. , @xmath25 ( remember that the sides of the triangle on the sky are also measured in radians ) .",
    "the given resolution is determined by the number of bins for @xmath26 , and the number of bins for @xmath24 .",
    "note that a particular triangle might appear more than once in this scheme , albeit with different resolutions .",
    "different triangular bins of the three - point function are strongly correlated anyway , and the correlation from duplicating triangles can be taken into account in the general statistical framework over correlated bins .    given a triangular configuration , and a pixel @xmath12 , all other pixels which enter the summation in equation  [ eq : estimator ] are located on two concentric rings of size @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as a consequence , the summation over fixed @xmath24 can be thought of as an unnormalized ( raw ) two - point correlation function between two rings . to obtain three - point correlation function ,",
    "one has to multiply this two - point correlation function with the value of the center pixel @xmath12 and finally sum over @xmath12 .",
    "calculating the two - point correlation function of rings can be fast if one repixellizes the map ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : rings ] ) into rings with sizes matching the binning scheme for @xmath29 , and uniform division in @xmath24 .",
    "such a repixellization , resulting in ring - pixels as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] , would take only @xmath0 steps even in a naive way ; the healpix hierarchical scheme allows it to be done in @xmath30 time .",
    "we use the following algorithm : let us start a recursive tree walk at the coarsest map , @xmath31 in the healpix scheme . for each pixel in this map ,",
    "we determine , using its center , which ring - pixel it would belong to . if the size of the pixel is much smaller than this ring - pixel ( how much smaller is a parameter of our algorithm : in this paper we used the condition that the pixel has to be smaller then @xmath32 the bin width which is also the approximate size of the ring - pixels ) , we record it . if not , algorithm splits the quad - tree , and calls itself recursively for each four sub - pixels .",
    "this procedure ends at the latest when the highest resolution ( i.e. the one of the underlying map ) is reached .",
    "if the bins are chosen appropriately such that large ring - pixels are set up for large triangles , for many pixels it will finish earlier .",
    "as noted above , the map has to be regridded around each pixel into rings of ring - pixels . in total , this takes @xmath33 time .    calculating the two - point correlation function between rings",
    "speeds up using fast fourier transform ( fft ) methods , such as those put forward in @xcite .",
    "the recipe is the following .",
    "first , fft every ring @xmath12 to obtain complex coefficients @xmath34 ; then calculate for every pair of rings @xmath35 the `` pseudo power spectrum '' @xmath36 , where @xmath37 means complex conjugate . due to the u(1 ) symmetry of the ring",
    "an inverse @xmath38 transform will give the ( raw ) two - point correlation function between the two rings ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if we have @xmath39 rings , each of them @xmath40 ring - pixels , each fft can be done in @xmath41 time , and there is @xmath42 cross correlations to be calculated for a full scan of configurations . all the above needs to be performed for each pixel as a center point .",
    "the total scaling ( including the initial regridding ) takes @xmath43 , where we took into account that the two opposite pixels can be handled in one go if a symmetric set of bins around @xmath44 are used for @xmath29 .",
    "while the above procedure to calculate raw ( unnormalized ) correlation functions appears somewhat complex , we have checked with direct calculation that it gives numerically the same result as calculating correlations on the rings in a naive way . in order to obtain normalized correlation functions",
    ", the same procedure has to be followed for the rings associated with weights / masks .",
    "each configuration of the raw three - point function is divided with the mask / weight three - point function for the final result .",
    "for many realizations with the same mask , such as in the case of massive monte carlo simulations , the mask correlations need to be estimated only once , representing negligible cost .",
    "the above abstract scheme and calculation will be illustrated and further clarified with a practical application to wmap next .",
    "we demonstrate our method to calculate the three - point correlation function with an application to wmap .",
    "we downloaded first year foreground cleaned maps from lambda website@xcite .",
    "there are total 8 maps for 8 differencing assemblies ( da ) in q , v and w bands : q1 , q2 , v1 , v2 , w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , already in healpix format .",
    "following the two - point analysis of wmap @xcite , we only used cross correlations , i.e. three - point correlation functions calculated from three different das .",
    "we produced 100 ( gaussian ) simulations with synfast in healpix package .",
    "the input power spectrum , also from the lambda website , was taken from @xmath6cdm model using a scale - dependent ( running ) primordial spectral index which best fits the wmap , cbi and acbar cmb data , plus the 2df and lyman - alpha data .",
    "every simulation consists of 8 assembly maps as the data @xcite .",
    "these 8 maps were generated with a same random seed , representing the same primordial cmb , but 8 different beam transfer functions .",
    "then different simulated noise maps from lambda web @xcite were added to the synfast output maps .    since the non - gaussian signal is exceedingly small , and on the smallest scales the data are noise dominated , we degraded all maps ( simulations and data ) to @xmath45 after applying the kp2 mask .",
    "more precisely , we added up pixel and weight values for each map ; our two weighting schemes are presented in the next subsection .      at the heart of our algorithm",
    "is the regridding of figure  [ fig : rings ] which matches our binning of the triangles .",
    "we chose 19 rings for half of the sphere surface , and the same bins are repeated on the other half symmetrically around @xmath44 . the 19 bins are chosen to be uniformly distributed in logarithm between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the number 19 was chosen such that @xmath48 , which gives a logarithmic resolution of @xmath49 .",
    "every ring was divided to 20 ring - pixels in @xmath24 .",
    "this number renders the resulting ring - pixels fairly compact , and it is also convenient for our chosen implementation of fft ( fftw , * ? ? ?",
    "weight maps were constructed using the kp2 mask and the noise profile of the maps .",
    "we used two weighting schemes : flat weighting where @xmath20 is 1 or 0 depending on the mask , and ( inverse ) noise weighting ; for the latter @xcite we used the effective number of observations of the pixel .",
    "the weights need to be determined only up to multiplicative factor , as their overall normalization cancels from the algorithm .",
    "the average noise level @xmath50 for each da is used when combining @xmath14 over different cross correlations .",
    "the total number of triangular configurations in @xmath51 rings with @xmath52 possible values of @xmath24 ( angles large than @xmath53 count to @xmath54 ) is @xmath55 for autocorrelations .",
    "the same number is valid for a cross correlations ( which we will be exclusively doing ) of 3 das .",
    "we introduce the notation ( da1 , da2 , da3 ) , for the central pixel , the first ring and the second ring sampled from the three da in this order .",
    "in addition we restrict the `` first ring '' has @xmath26 no larger than that of the `` second ring '' .",
    "then the total number of cross correlations between the 8 da s is @xmath56 .",
    "effectively , each triangle is calculated six times for a given triplet of da s due to the possible 6 permutations .",
    "however , each sample has a different resolution , therefore we opt to keep all possibilities .",
    "the resulting correlations are taken into account when dealing with correlated bins in general . in total",
    ", there are about @xmath57 triangular configurations for each data or simulation set .",
    "note that the total number of triplets of ring - pixels examined is @xmath58 more , or @xmath59 .",
    "this is still a lot smaller than checking @xmath60 triplets of pixels naively in an @xmath61 map .",
    "these numbers suggest that our algorithm even without fft should take order of days , while the naive algorithm would need over 200 years of cpu .    for a batch of @xmath62 simulations ( comprising of @xmath63 da maps ) ,",
    "the calculation of the full three - point function in all the configuration takes about 90 hours on an intel xeon 2.4ghz cpu .",
    "this means each cross - correlation takes only about @xmath64 minutes on average !",
    "about 10 hours are saved by batch processing 10 sets of simulations : to estimate @xmath14 in the data alone ( one set of 8 da files ) took 10 hours .",
    "clearly , the given resolution does not extract all the information from the data , as there are approximately @xmath65 distinct configurations of the bispectrum or three - point function .",
    "however , it surely must be redundant to extract more configurations than the amount of data .",
    "the ratio of data points vs. configurations is about @xmath66 for our chosen bins .",
    "it is unlikely that it were fruitful to push this number towards much smaller values , although the speed of our algorithm would allow higher resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : zeta ] shows a typical set of @xmath14 measurements for the ( w2,w3,w4 ) da cross - correlation .",
    "the results from wmap lie comfortably in the 68% range of results from gaussian simulations .",
    "similar results are found for the other da combinations , or when all the 24 possible w - only da results are averaged .",
    "although different combinations have different effective beam , full averaging is meaningful on large scales .",
    "we checked that averaging all 336 possible combinations is also consistent with gaussian .",
    "finally , repeating all the measurement with noise weighting produced no obvious departure from gaussianity either .",
    "at the same time , the scatter in the simulations , i.e. , the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath14 from 100 simulation , shows a slightly non - gaussian signature .",
    "for ( w2,w3,w4 ) , figure  [ fig : hist ] shows a histogram derived from all simulated @xmath14 values normalized by their measured median and 68% levels .",
    "slight deviations from gaussian distribution are evident : student distribution of degree 3 fits better the overall distribution .",
    "this same distribution produces lower @xmath67 when applied to _ individual _ triangular configurations according to the inset , i.e. it is a ( marginally ) better fit than gaussian .",
    "we fully take this into account in our hypothesis testing which is described next .",
    "our goal is to test the null - hypothesis of gaussianity against our measurements by means of comparing the @xmath14 values measured from the data with the corresponding probability distribution function ( pdf ) determined from gaussian simulations .",
    "a crucial step in the traditional @xmath67 method appears to be computationally infeasible due to the large number of configurations : calculation of the ( pseudo ) inverse of an @xmath68 matrix for @xmath69 , the total number of our highly correlated configurations .",
    "moreover , as seen above , the underlying pdf marginally violates gaussian assumption , even for gaussian simulations . even if it were possible to calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix , and we were to accept the accuracy of the gaussianity in pdf of the individual bins , it is not possible to determine the underlying covariance matrix with sufficient accuracy .",
    "in fact , one would need ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) at least ( and likely much more than ) 2.6 million simulations for that purpose . @xcite",
    "have shown that using simulations with uncorrelated noise might result in spurious detection of non - gaussianity .",
    "therefore we chose to use only the wmap supplied correlated noise simulations , of which 110 is available at present .",
    "it is straightforward to test the null - hypothesis with a single configuration : we can calculate a @xmath70-value from the best fit student distribution from our simulations .",
    "the @xmath70-value is defined as the probability of obtaining a @xmath14 value that is at least as extreme as the one measured from wmap . for a threshold @xmath71",
    ", the null - hypothesis is rejected at @xmath72 level if the @xmath70-value of the datum is smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "a problem arises from combining 2.6 million tests when all the data are used .",
    "for instance , even if the hypothesis were true , about 260 bins would still be rejected at the @xmath73 level ( ignoring the correlations in the data ) .",
    "fortunately a robust and simple method exists for massive hypothesis testing , which is insensitive to correlations between the tests , and makes no assumption on the gaussianity of the underlying error distribution : the method of false discovery rate ( fdr ) @xcite . in astronomy , it has been successfully applied in the context of image processing and finding outliers by @xcite , which can be consulted for a more detailed introduction .",
    "the fdr method combines the same @xmath70-value as defined above for individual tests using a threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis .",
    "this combination is insensitive to correlations and has more statistical power than naive combination .",
    "our goal is to adapt this powerful method for hypothesis testing of three - point correlation function measurements with overwhelming number of configurations .",
    "the fdr method gives a simple prescription for finding a threshold for rejection .",
    "in particular , the recipe suggests that we choose a threshold such that we control the rate of _ false rejections _ or fdr .",
    "the parameter , taking a similar role to the confidence interval in more traditional tests , is the maximum rate of fdr .",
    "if we fix an @xmath24 such that @xmath74 , the fdr procedure will guarantee @xmath75 in ensemble average .",
    "next we describe the recipe to control fdr ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the @xmath70-values calculated from the measurements of @xmath0 configurations , _ sorted _ from smallest to largest .",
    "let @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant depending on the level of correlations between different configurations . for uncorrelated data @xmath79 ; while @xmath80 can be used for correlated data @xcite .",
    "note that technically one would have to adjust @xmath78 to the degree of correlations in the data .",
    "the suggested value for correlated data is extremely conservative , and should be considered as a strong upper limit . even using this conservative",
    "adjustment decreases the statistical power of the technique only logarithmically ; the final results are expected to be robust regardless of the degree of correlations .",
    "if configurations with @xmath81 are rejected , equation  [ eq : fdr ] will hold @xcite , i.e. the fdr is controlled according to our preset parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the procedure is represented graphically on figure  [ fig : fdr ] : @xmath82 is plotted against @xmath83 superposed with the line through the origin of slope @xmath84 .",
    "all @xmath70-values reject the null hypotheses which are to the left from the last point at which @xmath82 falls below the line .",
    "these might include some false discoveries which are guaranteed to be a smaller fraction than @xmath24 in ensemble average .",
    "we have applied the fdr recipe to all of our individual cross - three point functions , as well as our full data set .",
    "since @xmath78 is a constant , initially we kept @xmath79 . for a fixed @xmath24 ,",
    "the results can be subsequently reinterpreted in terms of any @xmath85 . for da combination ( w2 , w3 , w4 )",
    ", there is no rejection for @xmath86 , i.e. , allowing as high as 81% false rejections , not a single configuration rejected our gaussian null hypothesis .",
    "correlations might increase @xmath78 , but it must be @xmath87 .",
    "the true @xmath24 , when correlations are taking into account , can only be larger than our effective @xmath24 for @xmath79 . in other words ,",
    "the data are fully consistent with gaussianity .    as a sanity check",
    ", we repeated the fdr analysis in our simulations as well . by scanning through different @xmath24 values from 0 to 1",
    ", we find that 50 out of 100 simulations have rejections with @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the wmap measurements are fully consistent with gaussianity at a level better than 1-@xmath3 in the traditional sense . in summary , at the three - point level , scanning all configurations , we did not find any significant non - gaussianty which would be localized in pixel space triangular configurations .",
    "we performed fdr analysis on all @xmath88 measurements individually , as well as on the combination of all those measurements with @xmath89 million configurations in total .",
    "none of these cases produced credible evidence for non - gaussianity and all of them were fully consistent with our null hypothesis at @xmath90 .",
    "we presented a new method to measure angular three - point correlation functions on spherical maps .",
    "we achieve an unprecedented @xmath1 scaling with a combination of hierarchical and fourier algorithms .",
    "the speed of our technique allows a systematical scan of the full available configuration space at a given resolution .",
    "such speed is especially useful for cross correlations and monte carlo simulations , where a vast number of configurations and measurements need to be performed .",
    "we have achieved a speed of about @xmath64 minutes per cross correlations , when 336 cross - correlations have been estimated simultaneously in @xmath45 healpix maps using a single intel xeon 2.4ghz cpu .",
    "this is to be contrasted with a naive approach , which would have taken about 200 years per cross - correlations ; a @xmath91 million fold speed up .    as a first application of our code we analyzed the first year wmap data along with 100 realistic simulations .",
    "we have calculated cross - correlations for about @xmath92 triangular configurations , or about @xmath59 triplets in total in maps of @xmath45 corresponding the @xmath93 da s .",
    "the ratio of pixels / configurations is about 50 for each measurement .",
    "comparing our measurements from 100 gaussian simulations with realistic correlated noise , we found wmap to be comfortably within the 68% percent range for most configurations . any significant departure from gaussianity at the three - point level ,",
    "even if localized in particular triangular configurations , would have shown up clearly in our full scan of the available configuration space .",
    "our main result is that there is no credible evidence of non - gaussianity at the three - point level at any of the triangular configurations we examined . as a consequence ,",
    "if the tentative detection of non - gaussianity claimed in previous works holds up , it should correspond to either 4-point or higher order correlations , or to spatially localized features which break rotational invariance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast with our measurements , all previous studies of higher order statistics used autocorrelations .",
    "comparison of our errorbars with that of @xcite appears to show that this increases the errors by a factor of two ( see the discussions below ) .",
    "in addition , many measurements used uncorrelated noise simulations . according to the findings of @xcite , this might increase the likelihood of finding spurious non - gaussianity .",
    "analysis of our gaussian simulations revealed that there is a slight non - gaussianity in the error distribution of individual configurations .",
    "this is not surprising , since three - point correlation function is a non - linear construction of the gaussian random variables ( c.f .",
    "the error distribution is well fit by a student distribution with 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "to quantify any possible departure of the overall data set from gaussianity , we introduced a new technique , fdr , to interpret three - point statistics .",
    "this corresponds to an optimized multiple hypothesis testing , and it is insensitive to the unavoidable correlations in the data . all of our fdr tests , whether applied to any of the 336 cross correlations , or the combined data set , were fully consistent with gaussianity with better then 1-@xmath3 .",
    "this quantifies our previous assertion based on examination of the individual configurations under the assumption of statistical isotropy .",
    "the above model independent tests showed that there is no credible evidence of any non - gaussianity in the data .",
    "next we illustrate how our measurements yield constraints on specific non - gaussian models .",
    "we choose a simple phenomenological model corresponding to the quadratic expansion of the density field in terms of one parameter , @xmath4 , as put forward by @xcite : @xmath94    to obtain constraints on this parameter , we construct an estimator for @xmath4 @xmath95 where @xmath14 is our measurement in data or simulation maps .",
    "we calculated the two - point correlation function @xmath96 analytically , to avoid any bias from the non - linear construction ( c.f .",
    "we used the same best fit power spectrum as for the simulations , as well as taking into account beam and pixel window functions .",
    "since previous measurements already established the weakness of non - gaussianity , our gaussian simulations should be accurate enough to calculate the variance @xcite .",
    "applying the same estimator to our 100 simulations , we obtained error bars for @xmath4 estimated from each particular configuration .",
    "the simplicity of the phenomenological model lies in the fact that a constant value of @xmath4 is assumed .",
    "we do not attempt to combine our estimates optimally , instead we use simple considerations .",
    "the signal increases towards small scales in this model , while noise dominates on the smallest scales .",
    "since we already discarded the smallest scales when using @xmath61 , it is intuitively clear that most signal pertaining to this model will be concentrated in the small fraction of the triangles corresponding to small scales , in particular the skewness . to confirm this we generated and analyzed a set of non - gaussian simulations according to equation  [ eq : nong ] , with @xmath4 equal to 1000 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 , and 6000 .",
    "inspection of the configurations together with the errorbars from the gaussian simulations confirmed the above idea .",
    "therefore we decided to use the skewness , which corresponds to giving zero weight to all other configurations when combining our @xmath4 estimators . from these",
    "we obtain @xmath97 where the errorbar was estimated from the gaussian simulations .",
    "@xcite quotes similar constraints for a low quadrupole cdm model , but their errorbars are a factor of two larger for a @xmath6cdm model similar to the one we use . the fact that we obtained a factor of two tighter constraints than @xcite suggests that using cross - correlations is superior to auto - correlations for three - point statistics of wmap    as a sanity check , we calculated the mean value of the skewness estimator for 100 gaussian simulations ; it yields about @xmath98 . on the other hand ,",
    "we also demonstrate that we can recover @xmath4 from the non - gaussian simulations .",
    "all the simulations have the same underlying gaussian signal and noise , the only difference is the value of @xmath4 .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : fnlt ] the errors might be underestimated when @xmath99 , and/or there might be a small low bias , but it is clear from the figure that we could detect non - gaussianity if it were present .    a suboptimal combination of @xmath4 estimates from all configurations weighted by their inverse variance yields about @xmath100 , a significantly weaker result , confirming the intuitive idea that most of the signal is concentrated on small scales .    some of the results in this paper have been derived using the healpix @xcite package .",

    "<S> we present a new method to estimate three - point correlations in cosmic microwave background maps . </S>",
    "<S> our fast fourier transform based implementation estimates three - point functions using all possible configurations ( triangles ) at a controlled resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the speed of the technique depends both on the resolution and the total number of pixels @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath1 scaling is substantially faster than naive methods with prohibitive @xmath2 scaling . as an initial application , </S>",
    "<S> we measure three - point correlation functions in the first year data release of the wilkinson anisotropy probe . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate 336 cross - correlations of any triplet of maps from the 8 differential assemblies , scanning altogether 2.6 million triangular configurations . </S>",
    "<S> estimating covariances from gaussian signal plus realistic noise simulations , we perform a null - hypothesis testing with regards to the gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that at the three - point level wmap is fully consistent with gaussianity . to quantify the level of possible deviations , we introduce false discovery rate analysis , a novel statistical technique to analyze for three - point measurements </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the data are consistent with gaussianity at better than 1-@xmath3 level when jointly considering all configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain a specific non - gaussian model using the quadratic approximation of weak non - gaussianities in terms of the @xmath4 parameter , for which we construct an estimator from the the three - point function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that using the skewness alone is more constraining than a heuristic suboptimal combination of all our results ; our best estimate is @xmath5 assuming a @xmath6cdm concordance model . </S>"
