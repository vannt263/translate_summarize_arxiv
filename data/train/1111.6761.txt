    "in high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors ( htsc ) , the dilemma between superconducting fluctuations above the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath0 , and inhomogeneities was already posed by bednorz and mller in their seminal work:@xcite after having indicated that the rounding of the electrical resistivity around the average @xmath0 in their lanthanum - barium - copper oxide could be due to inhomogeneities , they added `` _ _ the onset _ _ ( of the resistivity drop ) _ can also be due to fluctuations in the superconducting wave function _ '' .",
    "it was soon established that the observed rounding effects were much stronger than the ones expected from the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs and that they could be explained by the presence of extrinsic @xmath0-inhomogeneities with long characteristic lengths [ larger than the in - plane superconducting coherence length amplitude , @xmath4 , associated with chemical inhomogeneities.@xcite in fact , their layered nature and the complexity of their chemistry enhance the relevance of the extrinsic inhomogeneity effects in real htsc . since these earlier results ,",
    "the entanglement between superconducting fluctuations and inhomogeneities with different characteristic lengths and spatial distributions has played a central role when analyzing the measurements of any observable around the superconducting transition in cuprates.@xcite    in the case of the rounding above @xmath0 of the normal state magnetization , the so - called _ precursor diamagnetism _ , the dilemma in cuprate superconductors between superconducting fluctuations above @xmath0 and inhomogeneities was open years ago , mainly in the underdoped compounds having a pseudogap in the normal state .",
    "earlier measurements in the underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco-0.1 ) suggested that its precursor diamagnetism still is , from a phenomenological point of view , conventional.@xcite in fact , not too close to @xmath0 these magnetization rounding effects were explained at a quantitative level in terms of the gaussian - ginzburg - landau ( ggl ) approach for homogeneous layered superconductors.@xcite therefore , these results suggested that , as it was also the case of the bcs metallic low-@xmath0 superconductors,@xcite or of the optimal doped cuprates,@xcite the precursor diamagnetism in underdoped cuprates is due to fluctuating superconducting pairs , and is not affected by the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state .",
    "the anomalies observed since then by various groups in different htsc , including the la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 compound,@xcite fueled different theoretical proposals of unconventional ( non - ggl ) precursor diamagnetism , in some cases seemingly confirming the popular scenario of phase incoherent superconductivity up to the pseudogap temperature.@xcite however , these anomalies were later easily explained in terms of @xmath0 inhomogeneities with long characteristic lengths associated to chemical disorder , which do not directly affect the superconducting transition own nature.@xcite in fact , as the diamagnetism in the superconducting state is orders of magnitude stronger than the one associated with fluctuating superconducting pairs , even the @xmath0-inhomogeneities inherent to the unavoidable random distribution of dopants could have a dramatic influence on the measurements .",
    "the relevance of these intrinsic - like @xmath0-inhomogeneities on the measurements of the precursor diamagnetism was probed in recent experiments in the lsco system.@xcite    the debate about the nature of the precursor diamagnetism in underdoped cuprates has been recently reopened by new measurements and analyses , some of which were again performed in lsco compounds , which seemingly confirm the intrinsically anomalous behavior of their magnetization above @xmath0.@xcite these anomalies include a huge and field dependent diamagnetism close to the average @xmath0 , and an increase with the temperature of the so - called upturn magnetic field , @xmath5 , at which the differential magnetic susceptibility changes from negative to positive on increasing the applied magnetic field , a behavior that can not be explained by a gaussian @xmath0 distribution.@xcite these different magnetization anomalies are being considered in various influential works as an evidence for phase incoherent superconductivity well above @xmath0,@xcite in particular because ",
    "_ there is hardly another known mechanism that can deliver diamagnetism of this magnitude_\".@xcite the relevance of the precursor diamagnetism is enhanced by the fact that another central experimental support for phase incoherent superconductivity above @xmath0 in cuprates , the relatively large amplitude of the nernst effect well above @xmath0 , has been recently questioned by various groups , which attributed such behavior to normal state effects.@xcite so , at present one of the main experimental arguments invoked to still support the popular phase - disordering scenario above @xmath0 for the cuprate superconductors is the seemingly non - ggl precursor diamagnetism.@xcite in fact , the coincidence of these seemingly intrinsic anomalies with those observed in measurements of the nernst effect has been claimed as  _ a fairly unequivocal diagnosis of vortex motion _ \" above @xmath0.@xcite    the results summarized above stress the interest of further study the influence of different inhomogeneities on the precursor diamagnetism in underdoped cuprate superconductors , in particular complementing our previous works on that issue.@xcite this is the central aim of our present paper , where we will first present magnetization measurements in two underdoped granular samples of the same nominal composition , la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco-0.1 ) , but with different structural and chemical disorder due to differences in the synthesis .",
    "these differences lead , in particular , to different x - ray diffraction linewidths and superconducting transition widths .",
    "these preliminary characterization measurements show that in one of the samples the chemical disorder is close to the intrinsic - like one , associated with the unavoidable random distribution of the sr ions ( which will be then present even in an ideal la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystal ) .",
    "the chemical disorder in this sample leads to a ( intrinsic - like ) @xmath0-distribution which may be approximated as symmetric , whereas the most disordered sample present a pronounced asymmetric @xmath0-distribution . as we will see here",
    ", a direct comparison between the as - measured magnetization in both samples already demonstrates that most of the observed anomalies are in fact extrinsic . when analyzed at a quantitative level ,",
    "these data show that the anomalies at low field amplitudes in the isothermal magnetization curves may be explained by the presence of structural and @xmath0-inhomogeneities with long characteristic lengths , much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion includes both the upturn magnetic field , @xmath5,@xcite and the apparently anomalous power - law dependence below @xmath5 , a behavior pompously called by some authors  _ fragile london rigidity_\".@xcite    our results will also provide a direct explanation in terms of @xmath0-inhomogeneities of a quite subtle anomaly , already commented above , affecting these isotherms : the increase of @xmath5 with the temperature , a dependence recently observed by lascialfari and co - workers@xcite at a quantitative level and that can not be explained in terms of a gaussian @xmath0 distribution .",
    "it will be shown here that this behavior may be still attributed to chemical disorder if it leads to an asymmetric @xmath0-distribution , extending well above the average transition temperature , @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , this is mainly the case in the most inhomogeneous samples , where such a temperature dependence of @xmath5 is observed to be more important : even a symmetric doping - level distribution could lead to an asymmetric @xmath0-distribution , due to the characteristic bell - shaped @xmath0 dependence on the doping level , @xmath8 .",
    "the only requisite is that such doping - level distribution is wide enough as to cover a region where @xmath0 presents a strongly non - linear @xmath8-dependence",
    ". this will be the case of the underdoped lsco if this region extends up to the optimum doping .",
    "then , it is shown that the inhomogeneity and the fluctuation effects may be disentangled by just applying a magnetic field large enough as to shift @xmath9 to low temperatures , by an amount of the order or larger than the superconducting transition width . in this way",
    ", we were able to quench inhomogeneity effects in the less inhomogeneous sample .",
    "the remaining diamagnetism is explained , even at a quantitative level , in terms of the ggl approach for homogeneous layered superconductors .",
    "complementarily , this agreement with the ggl approach also confirms our previous conclusions about the absence in the bulk of inhomogeneities with short characteristic lengths , as those observed by using surface probes.@xcite indirectly , they also support recent proposals that the large - amplitude nernst signal observed in the normal state in lsco is not associated with superconducting fluctuations.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : the fabrication and characterization of the samples is described in sec .",

    "iii.b these anomalies are explained in terms of an inhomogeneity model which takes into account the @xmath0 distributions present in the samples .",

    "the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "and the cu-@xmath10 components of the ( 220 ) line for sample 1 and 2 , respectively . whereas in sample 2 the two components overlap , in the most homogeneous sample they are resolved . ]",
    "we have used two granular la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco-0.1 ) samples , that were chosen instead of single crystals because they allow to change easily the structural and @xmath0-inhomogeneities , but conserving the same average chemical composition .",
    "this is a crucial experimental aspect of this work .",
    "in addition , the random orientation of the grains and the influence of the grains finite size may be easily taken into account when analyzing their magnetic behavior . following a standard procedure described in detail elsewhere ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) ,",
    "both samples were prepared by reacting in air at 930@xmath11c for 20 h stoichiometric proportions of thoroughly mixed powders of la@xmath12o@xmath13 , srco@xmath13 , and cuo ( 99.99% purity ) .",
    "sample 1 was reacted up to ten times with intermediate grindings in an agate mortar .",
    "such a number of grind - react ( g - r ) processes was shown to be enough to attain a superconducting transition - width close to the _ intrinsic _ one ( associated to the random distribution of the sr dopants).@xcite however , to study the influence of the extrinsic structural and chemical inhomogeneities on the precursor diamagnetism , sample 2 was prepared in a slightly different way : on the one side , it has been subjected to only four g - r process , so one may expect that this sample will have more chemical inhomogeneities and then more @xmath0-inhomogeneities . on the other , in order to obtain a smaller grain size , the intermediate grindings were performed with a commercial grinder ( retsch , model pm 100 ) . as we will see below , transition width and grain size are both factors strongly affecting the magnetic behavior of these materials around the average  @xmath0 .",
    "a first check of the samples chemical composition and homogeneity was provided by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements performed with a philips diffractometer equipped with a cu anode and a cu - k@xmath14 graphite monocromator . as it may be seen in fig .",
    "[ rx ] , the xrd patterns of both samples exclude the presence of impurity phases and are almost indistinguishable , the only difference being the larger linewidths in the case of sample 2 ( fabricated with less g - r processes ) . this behavior related to the number of g - r processes",
    "was already reported in ref .   and may be attributed to a more inhomogeneous sr distribution in sample 2 , which directly leads , as we will see below , to a wider @xmath0 distribution .",
    "another relevant difference between both samples concerns their average grain diameter , 5 @xmath15 m for sample 1 and 1 @xmath15 m for sample 2 as determined by scanning electron microscopy .    ,",
    "measured under very low magnetic field amplitudes ( 0.5 mt ) .",
    "the different behavior around @xmath7 in the two samples studied here may be observed in ( a ) : whereas sample  1 presents a relatively well defined diamagnetic transition , sample  2 is diamagnetic up to a temperature , @xmath16 , close to the highest critical temperature of the la@xmath17sr@xmath18cuo@xmath3 system ( @xmath19 k ) .",
    "an overview of these @xmath20 curves , together with their temperature derivatives ( solid lines ) , are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "one may see in ( c ) that the transition width , @xmath21 , for sample 2 does not take into account its markedly asymmetric @xmath0-distribution .",
    "other details are commented in the main text . ]",
    "the average transition temperatures ( @xmath7 ) and transition widths ( @xmath21 ) were estimated from the temperature dependence of the field - cooled ( fc ) magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath22 ) under low applied magnetic fields ( see table  i ) .",
    "@xmath7 is defined as the temperature at which the temperature derivative of the fc curve has its maximum .",
    "@xmath21 is defined as twice the high - temperature half - width at half - maximum of the @xmath23 versus @xmath24 curve . in this way",
    "we elude the extrinsic rounding associated with the competition between the grains size and the magnetic penetration length , which is appreciable mainly below @xmath7 ( see the note in ref .",
    "37 of ref .  ) . also , as in this region @xmath25 , the demagnetization effects may be neglected . in the case of samples with a markedly asymmetric @xmath0-distribution , extending well above @xmath7 ( in a temperature region where @xmath26 around @xmath7 can no longer be approximated as gaussian ) , as a complementary characterization of the @xmath0 distribution we introduce @xmath16 , roughly defined as the temperature above which @xmath26 is below the experimental uncertainty .    .",
    "one may see that the behavior of these isotherms differs dramatically from sample to sample , mainly below @xmath7 .",
    "the pronounced minimum at very low fields corresponds to the lower critical field ( @xmath27 ) . in sample  2 one",
    "may observe a shift of this minimum to higher fields and also a rounding .",
    "both behaviors clearly suggest the presence of @xmath0-inhomogeneities , which will affect more deeply sample  2 .",
    "this scenario is supported by the as - measured magnetization versus temperature curves shown in the insets : the @xmath28 curve measured in sample  2 is much more rounded above its @xmath7 than the equivalent curve measured in sample  1 .",
    "the solid lines here are the background magnetization , obtained as explained in the main text . ]    an example of the @xmath20 curves for each sample is presented in fig .",
    "[ tc ] , together with the corresponding temperature derivatives .",
    "these measurements were performed with a superconducting quantum interference magnetometer ( quantum design , model mpms - xl ) and under low fields ( around 0.5 mt ) .",
    "important differences between these curves for both samples are readily observable in spite of the above mentioned similarities between their xrd patterns : on the one side , as a consequence of its larger average grain size , sample 1 presents a much larger meissner signal . on the other ,",
    "the improved sr distribution in sample 1 makes its diamagnetic transition much sharper than in sample 2 : for sample 1 , @xmath29 ( which is close to the intrinsic value associated to the unavoidable random distribution of the sr dopants , see ref .  ) , while @xmath30 for sample  2 .",
    "in fact , as may be already observed in fig .",
    "[ tc](a ) , this sample is slightly diamagnetic up to a temperature near the maximum transition temperature for the la@xmath17sr@xmath18cuo@xmath3 system ( @xmath19  k ) , see table i. such a behavior is illustrated at a more quantitative level in figs .",
    "[ tc](b ) and ( c ) through the @xmath26 curves .",
    "we will see in the next section that such an asymmetric @xmath0-distribution plays a crucial role in the fine - detail behavior of the precursor diamagnetism measured in the most inhomogeneous samples .",
    "in particular , it leads to an increase of @xmath5 as the temperature of the corresponding isotherm increases .",
    "the values of these different parameters are summarized in table i.",
    "as already stressed in the introduction , some of the magnetization anomalies claimed in different works as convincing experimental evidences of an unconventional superconducting transition in cuprates , were observed in the low - field regime of the magnetization isotherms above the transition temperature.@xcite these seemingly intrinsic anomalies include the presence at low field amplitudes of the upturn magnetic field , @xmath5 , its temperature dependence , and a field - dependent and huge diamagnetism below @xmath5 , orders of magnitude larger than the diamagnetism associated with the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs .",
    "so , in this section we will first present detailed measurements of these isotherms in the two samples studied here .",
    "we will directly see in the as - measured curves two central aspects : even at a qualitative level , the behavior around @xmath7 at low fields is strongly sample dependent .",
    "this already suggests that such a behavior is not intrinsic .",
    "moreover , in the most inhomogeneous sample 2 , the magnetization around @xmath5 is of the same order of magnitude above and below @xmath7 , in both cases orders of magnitude larger than one may expect from the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs.@xcite as already shown when analyzing other magnetization anomalies in other experiments,@xcite the presence of inhomogeneities like the ones revealed in our samples by x - ray diffraction and low - field magnetometry , could lead to so huge amplitudes above @xmath7 .    to characterize at a quantitative level the magnetization anomalies we will introduce the so - called excess magnetization , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the _ background magnetization _ ( free from rounding effects such as the intrinsic fluctuation effects ) which may be approximated by extrapolating through the transition the normal state magnetization measured well above @xmath33 .",
    "some examples of the as - measured magnetization isotherms obtained in the low field regime around @xmath7 are shown in fig .",
    "[ isotherms ] .",
    "this regime corresponds to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the upper critical field perpendicular to the crystallographic @xmath36 planes linearly extrapolated to @xmath37  k. in this limit , the conventional ggl approach for the excess - magnetization associated with the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs above the superconducting transition reduces to the so - called schmidt regime , where the precursor diamagnetism is proportional to the applied magnetic field.@xcite these measurements were performed by using again a high resolution magnetometer based on the superconducting quantum interference ( quantum design , model mpms - xl ) , and following the procedures described in detail elsewhere ( see refs .  , and references therein ) .",
    "let us just stress here that special care was taken to avoid spurious contributions to the measured magnetization , in particular those that could be associated with the presence in the sample holder of minute quantities of oxygen , which has a paramagnetic transition around 45 k , a temperature region particularly sensitive for the precursor diamagnetism extraction in lsco compounds .    .",
    "the background or normal - state contribution was removed from these curves by subtracting the @xmath38 curve measured at 37  k , which is well above @xmath7 and where the fluctuation diamagnetism is expected to be negligible in the scale of these figures .",

    "it is just the anomalous behavior at very low reduced field amplitudes first observed by lascialfari and coworkers.@xcite this anomaly , which can not be explained on the grounds of the ginzburg - landau approaches for the diamagnetism induced by the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs,@xcite is being claimed by different authors as an evidence of the relevance of phase fluctuations above @xmath0 in cuprate superconductors.@xcite however , as already indicated in the introduction , contrary to these proposals it was already shown in refs .   that the presence in the samples of @xmath0 inhomogeneities at long length scales ( much larger than the coherence length amplitude ) could lead to a similar @xmath45 dependence around @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , a similar effect was observed also in disordered low-@xmath0 metallic alloys.@xcite    .",
    "these data were corrected for the normal - state contribution by subtracting the isotherm measured at 37  k ( well above @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dashed line joins the data points of the different isotherms where @xmath46 is located .",

    "the results summarized in figs .  [ sample1](a ) and [ sample2](a ) also allow to perform a crude but direct analysis of the observation that in some high-@xmath0 cuprates @xmath5 increases with temperature.@xcite as already commented in the introduction , such a behavior is being presented as a strong argument against the explanation of the magnetization anomalies in terms of @xmath0-inhomogeneities:@xcite in a naive inhomogeneity scenario , @xmath5 will mimic the lower critical field of the higher-@xmath0 domains , which decreases on increasing the temperature .",

    "moreover , the fact that sample 2 is just the one fabricated with a smaller number of grind - react processes and the one having a wider diamagnetic transition , strongly suggests already that such an @xmath5(t ) dependence is associated with inhomogeneities , although in a way not so direct as for sample 1 . in fact , we will see in the next section that such a behavior may be quantitatively explained in terms of an asymmetric @xmath0 distribution , extended well above the average @xmath0 . in turn , this kind of distribution may be easily explained in terms of a symmetric doping - level distribution , due to the characteristic bell - shaped @xmath0 dependence on the doping level .",

    "the central aim of this work was to contribute to establish the intrinsic precursor diamagnetism in high-@xmath0 superconductors and the origin of the anomalies recently observed in the magnetization above the superconducting transition in underdoped cuprates , in particular in lsco compounds .",
    "these new anomalies include a diamagnetism with a huge and field - dependent amplitude under very low reduced - magnetic fields and , simultaneously , close to the average @xmath0 .",
    "they induce also an increase when the temperature increases of the so - called upturn magnetic field @xmath5.@xcite moreover , as first reported by lascialfari and coworkers@xcite , below @xmath5 the isothermal magnetization curves show an anomalous power - law dependence on @xmath44.@xcite in spite of previous works warning that these type of anomalies could be due to the presence of @xmath0 inhomogeneities associated with chemical disorder,@xcite they are being considered by different authors as intrinsic to underdoped cuprates and then , without any serious confrontation with other possible causes , as an evidence for phase incoherent superconductivity in the pseudogap regime.@xcite in fact , these warnings have been taken into account only by lascialfari and coworkers,@xcite but the inhomogeneity origin of these new magnetization anomalies was discarded because symmetric @xmath0 distributions , the only ones taken into account by these authors , can not explain the observed temperature dependence of @xmath5 .    here , we have first presented detailed experimental results on the magnetization measured above the average transition temperature in two underdoped granular samples of the same nominal composition , la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco-0.1 ) , but with different structural and chemical disorder due to differences in their synthesis . in one of the samples the chemical disorder is just the intrinsic - like one , associated with the unavoidable random distribution of the sr ions ( which will be then present even in an ideal la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystal ) , and the corresponding @xmath0-inhomogeneities",
    "may be approximated as symmetric .",
    "in contrast , the most disordered sample presents a pronounced asymmetric @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the anomalies observed in the magnetization measurements around the superconducting transition , in particular in the isotherm magnetization curves under low magnetic field amplitudes , are similar to those claimed as intrinsic by other authors . however , the comparison of the as - measured data in both samples already shows directly that most of the observed magnetization anomalies are in fact extrinsic .",
    "when analyzed at a more quantitative level , these data first show that these anomalies may be explained by the presence of structural and @xmath0-inhomogeneities with long characteristic lengths , much larger than the in - plane superconducting coherence length amplitude .",
    "this conclusion includes the increase of @xmath5 as the temperature increases , that may be still attributed to @xmath0-inhomogeneities if they have a markedly asymmetric @xmath0-distribution , extended well above the average transition temperature .",
    "in fact , this is mainly the case in the most inhomogeneous samples , where such a temperature dependence of @xmath5 is observed to be more important .",
    "it was also shown experimentally that the inhomogeneity and the fluctuation effects in sample 1 , whose chemical disorder is close to the intrinsic one ( associated with the unavoidable random distribution of the sr ions),@xcite may be disentangled by just applying a magnetic field strong enough as to shift @xmath9 to low temperatures , by an amount of the order of or larger than the superconducting transition width associated with inhomogeneities .",
    "under such a field amplitude , for sample  1 of the order of 3  t , the inhomogeneity effects on the magnetization were quenched , and the remaining diamagnetic effects were explained in terms of the gaussian - ginzburg - landau approach for homogeneous layered superconductors .",
    "this agreement also confirms our previous conclusions about the absence in the bulk of intrinsic inhomogeneities with short characteristic lengths , as those observed by using surface probes.@xcite    complementarily , the agreement with the ggl approach was extended to high reduced - temperatures , for @xmath161 , by using a total - energy cutoff of the order of @xmath162 , this last corresponding to the limit imposed by the uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconducting wavefunction when the temperature increases.@xcite this result further confirms our earlier conclusions , obtained through measurements of both the diamagnetism above @xmath0,@xcite and of the in - plane paraconductivity,@xcite that the onset temperature , @xmath163 , for the superconducting fluctuations in underdoped cuprates is not affected by the opening of a pseudogap in their normal state .",
    "indirectly , these last results also support recent proposals that the large nernst signal observed in the normal state in lsco is not associated with superconducting fluctuations.@xcite nevertheless , the relevance that is being given at present to the precise location of @xmath163 in underdoped cuprates , and to the seeming disagreements between the values inferred from transport or magnetic measurements,@xcite make particularly desirable to extend our present magnetization measurements to the high reduced - temperature regime of cuprates with different dopings .",
    "for this task , our present results suggest the way to separate the intrinsic fluctuation effects from those due to a , symmetric or not , @xmath0 distribution .",
    "another aspect that will need further examination on the grounds of our present results concerns the magnetization measurements above @xmath0 in iron pnictides : whereas detailed results in a high - quality ba@xmath164k@xmath18fe@xmath12as@xmath12 single crystal have been explained in terms of conventional ggl approaches,@xcite recent measurements under very low field amplitudes in a polycrystalline sample ( smfeaso@xmath165f@xmath166 ) present anomalies similar to the ones described here for lsco samples.@xcite",

    "<S> the interplay between superconducting fluctuations and inhomogeneities presents a renewed interest due to recent works of different groups which apparently support an intrinsically anomalous ( beyond the conventional gaussian - ginzburg - landau scenario ) diamagnetism above @xmath0 in underdoped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion , mainly based in the observation of new anomalies in the isothermal magnetization curves at low field amplitudes , is in contradiction with our earlier results in the underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 [ phys .  </S>",

    "<S> these seemingly intrinsic anomalies are being presented in various influential works as a  _ thermodynamic evidence _ \" for phase incoherent superconductivity in the pseudogap regime , this last being at present a central and debated issue of the cuprate superconductors physics . to further probe the diamagnetism above @xmath0 in underdoped cuprates , here we have extended our magnetization measurements in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 to two samples with the same nominal composition but , due to different growth procedures , with different chemical disorder , in one of the samples this disorder being close to the intrinsic - like one , associated with the unavoidable random distribution of the sr ions ( which will be then present even in an ideal la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 crystal ) . for this sample </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding @xmath0-inhomogeneities may be approximated as symmetric around the average @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the most disordered sample presents a pronounced asymmetric @xmath0-distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison between the magnetization measured in both samples provide a crucial check of the chemical disorder origin of the observed diamagnetism anomalies , which are similar to those claimed as due to phase fluctuations by other authors . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion applies also to the sample affected only by the intrinsic - like chemical disorder , providing then a further check that , for all applied magnetic field amplitudes , the intrinsic diamagnetism above the superconducting transition of underdoped cuprates is not affected by the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown here that once these disorder effects are overcome , the remaining precursor diamagnetism may be accounted at a quantitative level in terms of the gaussian - ginzburg - landau approach under a total energy cutoff . </S>"
