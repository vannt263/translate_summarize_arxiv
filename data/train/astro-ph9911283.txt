    "the discovery of what appear to be sne dominating the light curves and spectral flux distributions ( sfds ) of the afterglows of grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "1999 ) at late times after these bursts strongly suggests that at least some , and perhaps all , of the long bursts are related to the deaths of massive stars . here , we build upon the results of reichart ( 1999 ) by modeling the sfd of the host galaxy of grb 970228 , fitting this model to measurements of the host galaxy , and using the fitted model to better subtract out the contribution of the host galaxy to measurements of the afterglow of this burst .    in figure 1 , we plot the observed sfd of the host galaxy of grb 970228 , as measured with",

    "1999 ) . to these measurements and a broadband measurement made with",
    "( castander & lamb 1999a ; fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is not plotted , we fit a two - parameter , spectral synthesis model ( see castander & lamb 1999a for details ) .",
    "the two parameters are the normalization of the sfd , and the age of the galaxy , defined to be the length of time that star formation has been occurring at a constant rate . taking @xmath1 mag for the galactic extinction along the line of sight ( castander & lamb 1999b )",
    ", we find a fitted age of @xmath2 myr ; different values of @xmath3 affect primarily the fitted age , and not the fitted sfd .",
    "furthermore , models in which star formation slows considerably , or ceases , are generally too red to account for the measurements .",
    "finally , we note that the fitted j- and r - band spectral fluxes are perfectly consistent with what one finds simply from linear interpolation between adjacent photometric bands .",
    "+     +    in figure 2 ( left panel ) , we plot the sfd of the afterglow minus the _ observed _ sfd of the host galaxy from figure 1 . for the sfd of the afterglow , we use the revised k- , j- , and r - band measurements of galama et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the i- and v - band measurements of castander & lamb ( 1999a ; see also fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) ; all of these measurements were taken between 30 and 38 days after the burst .",
    "we have scaled these measurements to a common time of 35 days after the burst , and have corrected these measurements for galactic extinction along the line of sight ( see reichart 1999 for details ) .",
    "the k - band measurement of the afterglow is consistent with that of the host galaxy ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) , resulting in an upper limit in figure 2 ; j- and r - band measurements of the host galaxy are not available , again resulting in upper limits in figure 2 . as originally concluded by reichart ( 1999 ) , this sfd is consistent with that of sn 1998bw , after transforming it to the redshift of the burst , @xmath4 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1999 ) , and correcting it for galactic extinction along its line of sight ( see reichart 1999 for details ) .    in figure 2 ( right panel )",
    ", we plot the same distribution , but minus the _ modeled _ sfd of the host galaxy from figure 1 . the sn - like component to the afterglow is detected in the j band , and possibly in the r band .",
    "the j - band measurement suggests that the sn - like component is @xmath5 mag fainter , and @xmath5 of a photometric band bluer , than sn 1998bw ; however , this difference in j - band spectral fluxes is significant only at the @xmath6 @xmath7 level .",
    "when possible photometric zero point errors and uncertainties in our spectral synthesis model of the sfd of the host galaxy are included , this difference is significant only at the @xmath8 @xmath7 level .",
    "however , it is suggestive of what is generally expected : the type ic sne that are theorized to be associated with bursts ( e.g. , woosley 1993 ) are not expected to be standard candles .",
    "given the rapid rate at which the afterglow of grb 990510 faded , @xmath9 ( stanek et al . 1999 ) or @xmath10 ( harrison et al . 1999 ) , at late times after the burst , a sn1998bw - like component to the afterglow , if present , could have dominated the light curve after about a month at red and nir wavelengths ( figure 3 ; lamb & reichart 1999 ) . however , fruchter et al .",
    "( 1999b ) find no evidence of such a component , to within a factor of 3  7 in brightness , from two broadband _",
    "hst_/stis observations .",
    "caution is in order before one concludes that a sn was not associated with grb 990510 , or one uses the non - detection of sn1998bw - like components to afterglows to place lower limits on the redshifts of bursts . in the case of grb 990510",
    ", the above calculation requires that assumptions be made about ( 1 ) the form of the sfd of the afterglow at the times of the observations , since the observations spanned a wavelength range of 300  900 nm ; ( 2 ) how to extrapolate the non - power - law light curve of the early afterglow to the times of the observations ; e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and harrison et al .",
    "( 1999 ) do this differently ; ( 3 ) the range of the luminosity distribution of sne associated with bursts , relative to the luminosity of sn 1998bw , since these sne are not expected to be standard candles ; ( 4 ) the sfd of sn 1998bw at ultraviolet wavelengths , since the redshift of this burst is @xmath11 ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 5 ) whether differences in host galaxy extinction along the sn 1998bw and grb 990510 lines of sight can be ignored ; and ( 6 ) the underlying cosmological model .",
    "if bursts are indeed associated with sne , then the first bursts should have occurred shortly after the first stars formed , at redshifts of @xmath12 ( ostriker & gnedin 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; valageas & silk 1999 ) . lamb & reichart ( 1999 ) show that bursts and their afterglows should be detectable out to these very high redshifts .",
    "one way , of many ( see lamb & reichart 1999 for details ) , in which bursts can be used to probe the early universe is to use them as beacons to locate sne at very high redshifts .    in figure 4 , we plot the v - band light curve of sn 1998bw added to the best - fit source - frame v - band light curve of the early afterglow of grb 970228 from reichart ( 1999 ) , transformed to various redshifts and corrected for galactic extinction ( see lamb & reichart 1999 for details ) .",
    "we use the v band because sn 1998bw peaked in this band .",
    "clearly , the peak of the sn component of the light curve can be detected , at least from space , out to the k band , which corresponds to a redshift of @xmath13 .",
    "the peak can not be detected at longer wavelengths since such faint magnitudes can not be reached in the l and m bands . however , from the k band , one should be able to detect sne like sn 1998bw blueward of the peak out to redshifts of @xmath0 .",
