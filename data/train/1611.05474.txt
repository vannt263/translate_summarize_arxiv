    "the formation and evolution of a protein family is a problem of the same importance as that of protein folding and unfolding .",
    "we also think that the last problem will be solved or at least treated on a more general perspective , by concentrating the theoretical research on the joint formation and evolution of the whole set of proteins of each protein family .",
    "a probabilistic analysis of a model for protein family formation is then most welcome which is able to unveil the specific nature of this protein family formation process ( pffp ) and the consequent folding / unfolding process .",
    "a pictorial representation of the pffp to be seen as a game for the upsurge of life and its homeostasis can be introduced by thinking on @xmath0 consecutive trials of @xmath1 icosahedra , each face of them corresponding to a different amino acid .",
    "this sort of ideas has been already introduced on the scientific literature of the entropy maximization principle @xcite .",
    "our desiderata is then to translate the information contained on biological almanacs ( protein databases ) in terms of random variables in order to model a dynamics for describing the folding and unfolding of proteins , this means that we think on pffp instead of the evolution of a single protein as the key to understand the protein dynamics .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce a description of the sample space of probability to be used in the calculations of the present contribution @xcite .",
    "we have also made a digression on generalized proposals of joint probabilities which should be used on future generalizations of the present work . in section 3 ,",
    "a poisson statistical receipt is derived from applications of a master equation method in order to derive one adequate probability distribution of our pffp problem @xcite in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we describe the distribution of amino acids in protein families and the pattern recognition through level curves of the probability distribution .",
    "we also determine the domain of the variables for the present probabilistic model . in section 6",
    ", we introduce a scheme in terms of graphical cartesian representations of level curves with selected protein families from the pfam database @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the possibility of using this representation to justify the classification of protein families into clans .",
    "a final section of concluding remarks will comment on the introduction of alternative candidates to usual probability distributions , like the use of joint probabilities and the study of non - additive entropy measures .",
    "all these proposals which aim to improve the pattern recognition method will appear in forthcoming publications .",
