[ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> , our dft result confirms the above picture . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy bands near the fermi level are mainly from the @xmath2 states , and the s-3@xmath5 bands are below @xmath23 ev . due to combined inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry , each band is spin degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> around @xmath24-point , one observes that : ( i ) the originally degenerate @xmath2 states are split by soc , and the @xmath7 doublet is higher than the @xmath8 quartet in energy , showing a negative soc ; ( ii ) the cu-4@xmath4 states dive below the @xmath2 states by about 1.1 ev , indicating an inverted band ordering . </S>",
    "<S> band filling dictates that the fermi level lies exactly in the gap ( @xmath25 mev ) between the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the band inversion at a single time reversal invariant momentum ( trim ) point directly indicates that the system is a strong ti . to further confirm the nontrivial band topology </S>",

    "<S> the task is simplified by analyzing the product of parity eigenvalues at the eight trim points  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this product is positive at @xmath24 and negative at other trims , in accordance with our analysis of the band inversion , which leads to a strong ti with @xmath3 indices @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the hallmark of ti is the existence of protected dirac - cone surface states with spin - momentum - locking . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](d ) , we plot the calculated surface energy spectra for ( 001 ) surface , clearly showing a single surface dirac - cone . here the dirac point is buried in the bulk valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> notice that for a constant energy above the dirac point , the surface states show a right - handed spin - momentum - locking pattern ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the negative soc , and is in contrast with almost all other tis ( which have left - handed helicity due to positive soc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same feature is also observed for other surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> all these evidences confirm that cu@xmath1s is a @xmath0-orbital ti .    se . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) low - energy band structure . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) projected spectrum on ( 001 ) surface showing dirac - cone surface states buried in the bulk valence band . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) surface states at @xmath27 ev ( marked in ( b ) ) , exhibiting a left - handed spin - momentum - locking.,width=347 ]    the effective soc strength @xmath9 could be tuned by varying the crystal environment , especially through the interaction with the anion @xmath5-orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the effect depends on both the interaction strength and the soc of @xmath5-orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> consider cu@xmath1se which has the same structure as cu@xmath1s . </S>",
    "<S> compared with s-3@xmath5 , the se-4@xmath5 orbitals are closer to the cu-@xmath2 orbitals in energy , and they also possess a stronger soc ( which is positive ) . consequently , one expects that the interaction with se-4@xmath5 would decrease the negativeness of @xmath9 for cu-@xmath2 states .    </S>",
    "<S> this speculation is confirmed by our dft result . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the composition of the low - energy bands in cu@xmath1se is similar to that of cu@xmath1s , however , its @xmath8 quartet is above the @xmath7 doublet ( see fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) , indicating that soc has changed from negative to positive . </S>",
    "<S> band filling dictates that the quartet is half - filled , so that the fermi level intersects with the degenerate states and the system must be a semimetal .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the band inversion near @xmath24-point between the cu-4@xmath4 states and the @xmath2 states is preserved , not affected by the sign change of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the surface states still exist for cu@xmath1se , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) , although they are submerged in the bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the spin - momentum - locking pattern here becomes left - handed ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) ) , which is consistent with the positive soc .     point . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) dispersion of the ( @xmath8 ) low - energy bands in [ 110 ] mirror plane , showing ( d ) a butterfly - shaped nodal line , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the crossing points marked in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) combining all the butterfly nodal lines leads to a nodal box . </S>",
    "<S> , width=347 ]    breaking inversion symmetry would split the spin - degenerate bands with soc , adding new ingredients to the physics . </S>",
    "<S> consider cuagse in which the inversion symmetry is naturally broken ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar to cu@xmath1se , its @xmath2 states have an effectively positive soc , hence the system is also a semimetal , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) . in cu@xmath1se , the conduction band and the valence band touch at a single point , but we shall see that in cuagse , the splitting of the @xmath8 quartet near @xmath24-point leads to nodal - line band - crossings .    the symmetry group contains six mirror planes which may be collectively denoted as @xmath30 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) , one observes that the four states in the quartet fully split along the @xmath24-@xmath31 line , on which the two middle bands cross each other at a point @xmath29 near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , along the @xmath24-@xmath32 direction , two middle bands become degenerate , which then cross the upper band at a triply - degenerate point ( labeled as @xmath28 ) . a careful scan of the band structure around @xmath24-point shows that these crossing points are not isolated ( see fig .  [ fig4](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in each @xmath30 mirror plane , the crossings near fermi level form a butterfly - shaped nodal line , which is possible since it is formed by the pair - wise crossings of three bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig .  [ fig4](d ) : along the diagonal ( i.e. @xmath24-@xmath32 ) direction , the crossing is protected and pinned by the @xmath33 symmetry such that the two states at each point on this line form a 2d irreducible representation @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) ; whereas for the arcs connecting the @xmath28 points , they are protected by the mirror plane because the two crossing bands have opposite mirror eigenvalues @xmath36 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that unlike most previously identified nodal lines which are unstable under soc  @xcite , the butterfly nodal line here is robust against soc , and actually it appears only when soc is included . combining the ` butterflies ' from all the mirror planes leads to the interesting nodal - box pattern shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been theoretically argued that a weyl semimetal phase must occur during the transition of an inversion - asymmetric system from a ti phase to a normal insulator phase  @xcite . for cuagse </S>",
    "<S> , we find that it is a ti under a small uniaxial compression , and it becomes a normal insulator under a tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> hence there must exist a weyl semimetal phase in - between . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully monitor the band structure change under uniaxial strains and find that the butterfly nodal lines quickly disappear upon applying a tensile strain . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the cubic symmetry leads to a dramatic change in the low - energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig5](a ) shows the band structure at 3% strain , in which the gap almost closes along the @xmath24-@xmath37 line . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a scan of the possible band - crossing points using a dense @xmath38-mesh and reveal that there exist four pairs of weyl points at ( @xmath390.001235 , 0 , @xmath390.1012 ) and ( 0 , @xmath390.001235 , @xmath390.1012 ) in unit of reciprocal lattice vectors . as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](b ) , the points in each time reversal pair ( i.e. , at opposite @xmath38-points ) have the same chirality , and the four pairs are further connected by the two remaining mirror planes @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( two points connected by mirror have opposite chiralities ) , so all the eight points are tied by symmetry and must locate at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is no other coexisting electron / hole pockets . </S>",
    "<S> such kind of weyl semimetals is referred to as  ideal \"  @xcite , regarded as good platforms for studying the interesting weyl physics .     </S>",

    "<S> a small gap is opened along @xmath24-@xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) schematic view of 4 pairs of weyl points in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) fermi arcs on the ( 001 ) surface form a closed loop . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) for ( 010 ) surface , fermi arcs coexist with dirac - cone surface states . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) shows states at energy of @xmath42 mev , where the dirac - cone states can be cearly distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> the green dots mark the surface - projections of weyl points.,width=347 ]    the surface of a weyl semimetal features fermi arcs connecting the surface - projected weyl points . on ( 001 ) </S>",
    "<S> surface , there are four projected points , each having a chirality of @xmath43 ( see fig .  [ fig5](b ) ) , hence there must be two arcs connected to each point . </S>",
    "<S> this is verified by the surface spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](c ) , where the fermi arcs are connected into a loop . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , for ( 010 ) surface , there are six projected weyl points , of which the middle ones on the @xmath44-axis have chirality @xmath45 and other four have chirality @xmath46 ( fig .  [ fig5](b ) ) . in the slice at fermi energy ( fig .  [ fig5](d ) ) , one observes the nearly straight fermi arcs connecting each @xmath47 triplet . </S>",
    "<S> but surprisingly , there appears an additional fermi circle , which looks like the ti dirac - cone surface states . by checking the surface state variation at constant energies around fermi level </S>",
    "<S> , one confirms that the circle is indeed separated from the fermi arcs ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](e ) ) . to explain its existence </S>",
    "<S> , we note that @xmath48 time reversal invariant plane is fully gapped in the bulk hence carries a @xmath3 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> using the wilson loop method  @xcite , we find that its @xmath49 , indicating that there must be a pair of gapless states in edge spectrum of the @xmath48 plane . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](d ) and  [ fig5](e ) , there must exist a time reversal pair on the @xmath48 line . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the existence of the dirac - cone is in fact required by the @xmath3 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> in retrospect , one notes that planes such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 also have nontrivial @xmath3 , but this does not lead to an additional dirac - cone for @xmath52 surface because the pattern of fermi arcs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](c ) already satisfies the requirement .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we have revealed an interesting family of topological materials in which the sign of soc controls topological phase . on the negative soc side , these materials are the first @xmath0-orbital ti discovered to date . </S>",
    "<S> we note that a few materials like tln and hgs have been proposed as tis with negative soc  @xcite , but their low - energy bands are still dominated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> the sign of soc determines the helicity of dirac - cone surface states like in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) and  [ fig3](c ) , which can be detected by spin - resolved arpes experiment . the ability to control the helicity gives us additional freedom in utilizing these states for spintronics applications . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it has been proposed that gapless interface states will emerge when two surfaces with opposite helicities are contacted  @xcite . the effect may be explored in our identified materials .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , almost all the identified nodal lines are unstable under soc . </S>",
    "<S> certain kind of robust nodal lines requires nonsymmorphic symmetries  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the butterfly nodal line discovered here is distinct in that : ( i ) it is formed under soc ; ( ii ) it does not require nonsymmorphic symmetries ; and ( iii ) it is from the pair - wise crossings of three bands , not just two bands . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the multiple ` butterflies ' constitute a novel nodal box under tetragonal symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the coexistence of fermi arcs and dirac - cone surface states was proposed at an interface between a weyl semimetal and a ti  @xcite , and is also proposed in a model study  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our work predicts the first material for its realization . </S>",
    "<S> the intriguing surface - state patterns can be directly probed via arpes experiment . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the interference between the fermi arcs and the dirac - cone may also lead to signatures in the quasiparticle interference pattern detectable via scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite . </S>"
