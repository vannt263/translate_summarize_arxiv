    "studying non - equilibrium dynamics provides a useful route to elucidate the properties of systems with quenched disorder .",
    "in addition it is very relevant for experiments , since most such systems form glassy states with ultraslow dynamics and usually do not reach full thermal equilibrium within the accessible time scales .",
    "this is the case for a variety of experimental systems such spin glasses @xcite , random field systems @xcite , vortex lines in superconductors @xcite , and domain growth in presence of quenched disorder . despite decades of extensive work ,",
    "there are still a number of unresolved issues in the theoretical description of the dynamics of systems with quenched disorder .",
    "this uncertainty is due , to a large extent , to the lack of physically relevant models for which analytical solutions can be obtained , providing clear cut answers to well posed questions .",
    "the need for such models is all the more acute since it is prohibitively difficult to obtain unambiguous answers from numerical simulations when the dynamics is ultraslow , especially since the interpretation is often blurred by the absence of precise theoretical predictions .",
    "solvable models , where the answers are known , should also provide useful testing ground for numerical methods by giving clues on the necessary simulation time scales and averaging procedures in disordered systems which are often dominated by rare events .",
    "some progress has been made in obtaining analytical solutions for the large time behavior of mean field type models @xcite .",
    "although it is still extremely unclear how much these mean field results will carry through to short range , finite dimensional systems , one outcome of these works @xcite has been to demonstrate the existence of several possible large time regimes and to attempt to classify them .",
    "this provides further motivation to study aging dynamics in a larger class of models , in particular to study the possible ways of taking the large time @xmath11 limits for correlations between configurations of the system at a waiting time @xmath12 after a quench at @xmath13 , and a later observation time @xmath14 .",
    "other types of approaches , such as droplet descriptions of the statics and the non - equilibrium dynamics of disordered systems @xcite , make use of domain growth arguments .",
    "these approaches emphasize the leading role of thermally activated processes , which should play an important role in short range models , while mean field dynamics may be dominated by other type of collective processes @xcite .",
    "the `` coarsening '' of domain structures evolving towards equilibrium has been studied extensively in pure models @xcite but little is known rigorously for domain growth with quenched disorder . thus these approaches are still to a large extent phenomenological and one would like to find models where solid results about aging in the presence of activated dynamics can be obtained analytically . a natural hope for that would be to study 1d models which could be used as testing grounds for more complex @xmath15 cases which have resisted analytic attack .",
    "a celebrated 1d toy model for glassy activated dynamics is the sinai model , which describes the diffusion of a random walker in a 1d random static force field ",
    "equivalent to a random potential which itself has the statistics of a 1d random walk @xcite .",
    "although this model ( with or without a bias ) has been much studied , the known analytical results @xcite usually concern single time and single particle quantities and are technically hard to obtain .",
    "it is known that this model without a bias exhibits non trivial ultraslow logarithmic behavior , as the walker typically moves as @xmath16 , as well as several dynamical phases with anomalous diffusion as the bias is increased from zero . by contrast , there was until now no exact results about two time aging dynamics , despite several mostly qualitative and numerical studies @xcite which found interesting aging behavior in this model .",
    "in addition , the sinai model has interesting extensions to many interacting particles , and via domain walls , to the glauber dynamics of 1d random field ising ferromagnets and spin glasses in a magnetic field .",
    "recently we have proposed an approach , based on a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method , which allows us to obtain many exact results for the non equilibrium dynamics of several 1d disordered systems @xcite .",
    "we have shown that it applies to the sinai model as well as to 1d disordered spin models and diffusion - reaction processes in sinai s type of energy landscapes . this rsrg method is closely related to that used to study disordered quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "the crucial feature of the rg is coarse - graining the energy landscape in a way that preserves the long time dynamics . in sinai s model",
    "the way to implement the rsrg is very direct : one decimates iteratively the _ smallest energy barrier _ in the system stopping when the time to surmount the smallest remaining barrier is of order the time scale of interest .",
    "despite its approximate character , the rsrg yields for many quantities asymptotically exact results .",
    "as in @xcite it works because the iterated distribution of barriers grows infinitely wide , consistent with @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show in detail how the rsrg method applies to the sinai model , allowing one to obtain in a simple way a large number of exact results .",
    "we obtain a host of quantities such as return and first passage probabilities , single time correlations as well as two time correlations of the type that are probed in aging experiments . given the long history of sinai s model , some of the results obtained here have been derived previously , by completely different methods .",
    "these methods include those from probability theory @xcite , as well as conventional methods of the physics of disordered systems , such as the dyson schmidt method , replica methods , supersymmetry , transfer matrix etc . @xcite . despite that ,",
    "a large number of our results are , to our knowledge , novel . indeed , as we aim to illustrate in this paper , the most interesting feature of the rsrg ,",
    "besides being simple to apply , is that it allows one to obtain all these results ( new and old ) from a _ single _ method , while other methods usually allow access to only specific types of exact results . as we will explain , the only limitations are the ones usually associated with any rg method .",
    "first , almost by definition , it only addresses and obtains exactly the universal quantities , i.e. , the ones which are independent of the short scale details of the model .",
    "second , it does rely on the global assumption that the starting model is within the basin of attraction of the zero temperature fixed point studied here , and is thus not `` exact from first principles '' .",
    "this is not a restriction in the case of the sinai model : because rigorous results already exist from probability theory , this last assumption can be considered established .    in two companion papers @xcite , we will detail the applications of the rsrg , given as a short account in @xcite , to the glauber dynamics of disordered spin models and to diffusion - reaction processes in presence of quenched disorder .",
    "these works rely heavily on the sinai model and the present work .",
    "thus we here give a detailed presentation of the results for sinai model .",
    "an interesting feature of the rsrg is that it demonstrates in a simple and operational way how the sinai model is related to other one - dimensional disordered models .",
    "more formal derivations of such mappings can also be made in some cases via free fermion models .",
    "for instance , the quantum xx spin chains with disorder and the random transverse field ising chain ( rtfic ) are related via jordan wigner transformations to free fermion models near half filling with disorder in the hopping term .",
    "this problem is in turn related , via its expression as a random dirac problem , to a supersymmetric random schrdinger operator @xcite identical to the fokker planck diffusion operator associated with the sinai model @xcite .",
    "most of these relations have been detailed previously in various contexts ( see , e.g. for a review @xcite ) .",
    "these disordered fermion models have been much reinvestigated recently as they provide examples of quantum delocalization transitions .",
    "it may sometimes be useful to recast them in terms of the sinai model where some quantities have a straightforward physical interpretation ( e.g. , the logarithmic arrhenius diffusion over barriers growing as a random walk gives the logarithmic energy dependence of the local density of states ) .",
    "the rsrg demonstrates such mappings for the low energy ( large time ) properties in a very direct way , as we will illustrate .",
    "zero drift in sinai s model corresponds to the self dual critical case in the rtfic @xcite and to the antiferromagnetic xx chain @xcite , while the zero velocity biased phase @xcite corresponds to the griffiths phase of the rtfic @xcite and a dimerized xx chain .",
    "as we show here , magnetization properties correspond to persistence properties in sinai s model .",
    "although the idea of studying random diffusion problem via real space decimation techniques has been used previously , it has been mostly applied to fractal or hierarchical landscapes ( see e.g. @xcite ) which are designed for such methods . by contrast ,",
    "here the rsrg emerges from the structure of the zero temperature fixed point itself , as the natural way to treat diffusion in a statistically translationally invariant disordered system , with no ad - hoc assumptions .",
    "interestingly , a similar property arises in the problem of the coarsening of the pure 1d @xmath17 model at zero temperature , which can be treated exactly by successive elimination of the smallest domains in the system @xcite , a method reminiscent of the rsrg studied here . finally note that since @xcite appeared , several new papers have been devoted to the sinai model @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ secmodels ] contains a pedagogical introduction to the real space renormalization ( rsrg ) approach for the sinai model .",
    "it terminates with the explicit expressions for the fixed points of the rsrg ( [ secsolutionrg ] ) . in section [ secsinglediffusion ]",
    "we compute the averaged single time diffusion front for the symmetric sinai model in ( [ secsinglediffusionsymm ] ) and with a bias in ( [ secsinglediffusionbias ] ) . in section",
    "[ thermal averages ] we study the returns to the origin ( persistence properties ) of the thermally averaged motion , as well as the statistics of the jumps , in the symmetric and biased case . in section [ truedynamics ] , we study returns to the origin of a single walker , distributions of first passage time and of the maximum position as well as the probability of meeeting of two walkers . section [ sectwotime ] is devoted to the aging properties of the sinai model and contains a general discussion ( [ subsecgeneral ] ) , calculations of singular parts of the diffusion front ( [ sub : singular ] ) , the full two - time probability distribution ( [ sub : full ] ) , and the analysis of a simpler case ( [ sub : resultsymmetric ] ) .",
    "the section terminates with the analysis of rare events and calculation of the front in the quasi - equilibrium regime ( [ sub : inwell ] ) and fluctuations in the single time diffusion front . in section [ finitesizerg ]",
    "the rsrg is studied in a finite size system ; equilibration properties , first passage times with boundaries and finite size diffusion fronts are computed .",
    "finally in section [ shrofokk ] we obtain the green s function of the associated schrdinger operators in [ greenfunction ] .",
    "section [ secconclusion ] contains the conclusions .",
    "further technicalities are relegated to various appendices .",
    "diffusion in one - dimensional random media has been modeled in three ways , which usually lead to equivalent classes of behavior in the large time limit .",
    "probabilists have often studied models discrete in time _ and _ space ; for instance , a particle on points of a one - dimensional lattice , @xmath18 , which jumps to the right ( @xmath19 ) with probability @xmath20 and to the left with probability @xmath21 .",
    "physicists on the other hand have often considered random hopping models , continuous in time but discrete in space , described by the master equation :    @xmath22    @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the transition rate and the current from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 from @xmath19 to @xmath18",
    ". finally fully continuum models , with fokker planck equation :    @xmath27    have also been studied ( with @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is useful to distinguish three classes of disorder ( within each description ) leading to different types of generic 1d large time behavior ( for uncorrelated disorder ) .",
    "\\(i ) _ detailed balance , random diffusion coefficient",
    "_    this corresponds to @xmath29 in ( [ defhopping ] ) or to @xmath30 and @xmath31 a random positive function .",
    "it is well known that the large time diffusion coefficient is @xmath32 for uncorrelated disorder and thus that this model exhibits asymptotic `` normal diffusion '' unless the @xmath33 have a broad distribution , with a tail near the origin , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) _ random traps _",
    "this corresponds to @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "each site is characterized by a release time , but the exit is with the same probability @xmath38 to the left or to the right ( the jump probability depends only on the starting point ) .",
    "again this model exhibits asymptotic `` normal diffusion '' unless the release times have an algebraically broad distribution .",
    "\\(iii ) _ generic case : sinai model _    in the generic case one can always parametrize the hopping rates as :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the temperature .",
    "this can be illustrated as in fig .",
    "1 : there is a symmetric barrier @xmath42 between sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 , plus an additional potential difference .",
    "the barrier @xmath42 gives the average diffusion coefficient ( or attempt frequency ) on the bond .",
    "the `` forces '' on the bonds are @xmath43 which represent a local bias . in a finite size system ( periodic in the @xmath44 ) the expressions ( [ paramhopping ] )",
    "correctly lead to the gibbs zero current equilibrium measure , @xmath45 .",
    "the main case of interest here and studied by sinai is that of _ independent random forces_. the generic case , for uncorrelated disorder and for distributions of @xmath46 and @xmath42 with fast enough decay ( e.g. faster than exponential ) all belong to the class of sinai s model , which is a discrete time model .",
    "a similar potential can be introduced for this model : @xmath47 .",
    "one can most easily visualize these as arrhenius motion in a random potential @xmath44 which itself performs a random walk , either symmetric or biased .",
    "this motion has been studied extensively and it is known that diffusion is logarithmic @xmath48 in the symmetric case , sublinear @xmath49 for a small bias ( @xmath50 ) and with a finite velocity @xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is related to the asymmetry of the force distributions as defined later .",
    "for convenience and to be specific in what follows we will mostly study , as our basic model , the random hopping model with the choice @xmath54 .",
    "we will also compare with the discrete time model originally studied by sinai .",
    "however , our results are much more general and apply to any model within the locally random force class ( with short range correlations ) .",
    "as described above , we consider models of diffusion in 1d landscapes in which walkers perform arrhenius diffusion in a potential @xmath55 ( @xmath18 is a site index ) .",
    "a `` force '' variable @xmath56 is defined on each bond @xmath57 ( indexed as bond @xmath18 ) and as in the sinai model , the @xmath46 are independent random variables with distribution @xmath58 .",
    "the long - time dynamics in such landscapes are primarily determined by the large barriers and deep valleys .",
    "thus we need to be able to focus on these aspects of the landscape while eliminating as much as possible the effects of the finer scale structure .",
    "we therefore introduce a renormalization procedure , for a given landscape , which will allow us , in this way , to study the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "we should emphasize that we will apply it mainly to the case of forces independent from bond to bond , but it can in principle be applied to any 1d landscape .",
    "the crucial feature which is needed for the rg to yield asymptotically exact results , is that the landscapes have extremal values of the potential which grow with length scale .",
    "this will make the distributions of the renormalized barriers broader and broader . in the case of the sinai model ,",
    "it is possible to follow exactly the rg flow ( because the forces remain uncorrelated under the rg ) and thus to check _ a posteriori _ that at large scales the distributions of renormalized barriers are indeed very broad .",
    "however , the procedure is much more general and would also lead to asymptotically exact results for correlated landscapes in which the renormalized barriers become higher and higher .",
    "the difficulty in such correlated cases is to follow the distributions .",
    "of course there are 1d landscapes for which the rsrg would not give exact results for the diffusion behavior : in particular , bounded potentials which have normal diffusive behavior .",
    "the rsrg procedure on a given landscape is implemented as follows .",
    "one can first group the bonds with the same sign of the force ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] c ) , and then can start , with no loss of generality , from an `` antiferromagnetic '' landscape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with the @xmath59 alternatively positive and negative ) but with a distribution of bond lengths @xmath60 .",
    "our starting model is thus defined by @xmath61 where the @xmath62 are the useful variables  called here `` barriers''and the two bond variables @xmath63 are chosen independently from bond to bond with an initial distribution @xmath64 . in the presence of a bias one needs two distinct distributions @xmath65 for `` descending bonds '' and @xmath66 for `` ascending bonds '' ( opposing the mean force ) , both normalized to unity .",
    "note that the combining together of consecutive descending bonds in this way naturally leads to an exponential tail in the distribution @xmath67 and likewise in @xmath68 .",
    "such exponential tails in barrier distributions will play an important role in the physics and in our analysis .",
    "we are interested in long times when the behavior will be dominated by large barriers and it is on these that we must focus .",
    "our rg procedure is conceptually simple : in a given energy landscape it consists of iterative decimation of the bond with the _ smallest barrier _ @xmath69 , say @xmath70 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at time scales much longer than @xmath71 , local equilibrium will be established between sites 2 and 3 and the rate for the walker to get from 4 to 1 will be essentially the same as it would be if sites 2 and 3 did not exist but 1 and 4 were instead connected by a bond with barrier @xmath72 and length @xmath73 we thus carry out exactly this replacement .",
    "this preserves the zigzag structure ( the model remains alternating `` up - down '' ) and the larger scale extrema of the potential since the total length and the extrema of @xmath74 in the segments are exactly preserved .",
    "furthermore if the starting distribution is independent forces from bond to bond , this remains so under the rg .",
    "one then keeps on iteratively eliminating barriers @xmath75 thereby gradually decreasing the minimum remaining barrier height , @xmath76 .",
    "note that there is no ambiguity in the case of continuous distributions as considered here , as one can always neglect the unlikely events when two neighbors or next nearest neighbors are within @xmath77 .",
    "the above rules for @xmath78 and @xmath79 define the rsrg transformation for arbitrary landscapes . in the case of the sinai landscape where bonds remain statistically independent",
    "one can define @xmath80 and introduce @xmath81 and @xmath82 which denote the probabilities that a @xmath83 renormalized bond at scale @xmath76 has a barrier @xmath84 and a length @xmath79 , each normalized by @xmath85 .",
    "one can then explicitly write closed rg equations for these two distributions describing their evolution under the decimation represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes a convolution with respect to @xmath88 only and @xmath89 with respect to both @xmath88 and @xmath79 with the variables to be convoluted denoted by dots . the first term on the r.h.s",
    ". represents the new renormalized bonds , the second the bonds which are decimated as neighbors of the smallest barrier and the last comes from keeping the distribution normalized .",
    "the total number @xmath90 of bonds in the system evolves as @xmath91 we need also to introduce the average lengths @xmath92 of a @xmath83 bond , and the total average length @xmath93 of a valley that evolves as @xmath94 we have of course that @xmath95 .    the rg equations ( [ rg1 ] ) derived here for sinai s model are identical to those derived to study the low energy properties of the random transverse field ising chain ( rtfic ) in @xcite ( we choose notations and conventions as in @xcite ) using a perturbative analysis of the effects of the strongest bonds and fields .",
    "the reason for this is that the two models are in fact formally related , as mentionned in the introduction . at the level of the rsrg equations",
    ", the mapping appears in a very simple way : the local random fields @xmath96 and the random exchanges @xmath97 in the rtfic correspond to the ascending and descending barriers respectively , through the relations @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "we can also identify the renormalization scale @xmath76 in both models .",
    "for the diffusion model it corresponds to an arrhenius time scale @xmath100 to go over a barrier @xmath101 , whereas in the quantum model it corresponds to the minimal energy scale of the levels which have been eliminated @xmath102 .",
    "the duality between @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the rtfic simply corresponds to reversing the average force ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) in sinai s model .",
    "as will be discussed below , the deviation from criticality parameter @xmath106 in the rtfic corresponds to the parameter @xmath107 in sinai s model ( see @xcite ) which controls the long time properties and the various phases and is defined for the original model with unit length bonds by @xmath108 zero drift corresponds to criticality in the rtfic @xcite , while the biased phase with zero velocity @xcite corresponds to the griffiths phase of the rtfic @xcite as will be discussed below .",
    "note however that the physical quantities of interest in the two models can be different .",
    "throughout the paper , we define the `` effective dynamics '' as the dynamics which consists in putting the particle at time @xmath14 at the bottom of the renormalized valley at scale @xmath109 which contains the starting point at @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus in the effective dynamics the particle does not move unless one of the bonds which are the sides of the renormalized valley to which it belongs is decimated , in which case it jumps to the bottom of the new renormalized bond as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . here , @xmath110 is a non - universal microscopic time scale , which throughout the paper we set to unity by appropriate redefinition of time units ; we can then use interchangably @xmath76 and @xmath111 .    _ symmetric case _",
    "this effective dynamics is an approximation of the true dynamics .",
    "but within the rg approach it can be seen that this approximation becomes better and better as @xmath112 increases since the distribution of barriers @xmath113 becomes broader and broader , as is detailed below .",
    "thus the renormalized landscape consists entirely of deep valleys separated by high barriers and with high probability the particle will be near the bottom of the valley in which it began . upon rescaling of space as @xmath114",
    "the effective dynamics of the diffusion front becomes exact as @xmath76 tends to @xmath115 as was proven in ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , the probability that the walker is close  in a precise sense that we discuss later  to its position given by the effective dynamics , approaches one at long times",
    "this stronger result has also been rigorously established .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is clearly a source of error in the approximation of the true dynamics by the effective dynamics when two neighboring bonds have barriers @xmath78 s that are within order @xmath41 of each other .",
    "however , the error introduced by assigning a particle to one of two almost - equal - depth neighboring valleys rather than splitting its distribution between the two valleys will occur more and more rarely at long scales .",
    "furthermore , any such error is wiped out by a later decimation which eliminates the two valleys in favor of a deeper valley .",
    "these errors thus lead only to subdominant contributions to the quantities that we will compute  with the exception of tails of certain distributions which are dominated by rare configurations of the lansdscape .",
    "these subdominant corrections can themselves be estimated via the rg .",
    "for instance the rescaled mean square thermal width of a packet @xmath116 ( with overbars denoting averaging over landscapes ) tends to @xmath117 for large @xmath76 which is its value in the effective dynamics , but has @xmath118 corrections coming from barrier degeneracies , estimated in section ( [ sub : rareevents ] ) .",
    "strong differences between the real dynamics and the effective dynamics can appear in some quantities , such as the persistence properties studied in sections ( [ thermal averages ] , [ truedynamics ] ) .",
    "these quantities are usually in some way nonlocal in time and depend on the behavior of the system over time . even in these cases though , as we show in section ( [ thermal averages ] , [ truedynamics ] ) , it is possible to compute some of these quantities by a proper interpretation and examination of the rg procedure .",
    "_ biased case _    in the biased case with a bias @xmath119",
    "one finds within the rg that the distribution of barriers against the drift is no longer infinitely broad .",
    "however if @xmath120 is small the barriers remain large enough so that the rsrg remains a good approximation . again , this approximation remains exact , in the same sense as above , in the appropriate scaling limit fixed @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( corresponding to the critical region of the rtfic ) . for a fixed @xmath120 one",
    "expects that the thermal packet is spread over several deep wells , but when @xmath123 the contributions of these few additional wells becomes subdominant .    to conclude this section ,",
    "we stress that despite its approximate character , our rsrg method allows us to obtain exact results for many quantities both for the symmetric and the weakly biased sinai model .",
    "we now consider the problem of diffusion in a semi - infinite one - dimensional medium defined as @xmath124 . in practice",
    "there are two main types of boundary conditions for the diffusing particle : ( i ) reflecting ( the current at the boundary is zero ) and ( ii ) absorbing ( the probability is zero at the boundary ) . we show in this section how both boundary conditions can be treated by adding to the bulk rsrg specific rules near the boundary , which we call boundary rsrg .",
    "let us start with the zero bias case and a reflecting boundary .",
    "this condition can be represented by placing a barrier with infinite potential @xmath125 at @xmath126 with @xmath127 finite , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figboundary ] .",
    "when grouping bonds with the same sign as in the previous section , the first bond will always be descending with an infinite barrier @xmath128 and a length @xmath129 .",
    "the decimation of the landscape then proceeds as in the bulk case except that now the first bond is never decimated and when the second bond gets decimated ( at @xmath130 ) it simply increases the length of the first bond @xmath131 .",
    "one can easily see that starting from a landscape where bonds are statistically uncorrelated  with a distribution @xmath132 for the first bond and @xmath133 for all the other bonds  they remain so under the boundary rsrg .",
    "upon increase in @xmath76 , the bulk distribution @xmath134 obeys the same rg equation ( [ rg1 ] ) while @xmath135 satisfies :    @xmath136    the case of an absorbing boundary can be treated in the same way since it amounts to setting the potential of the site @xmath126 to @xmath137 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figboundary ] .",
    "thus the first bond will always be ascending with an infinite barrier @xmath128 and a length @xmath129 ( and thus can not be decimated ) .",
    "the rules are thus the same as above with the same rg equation ( [ brsrg ] ) for the distribution @xmath132 of the length of the first bond .",
    "the interpretation is however different : the first bond represent an `` absorbing zone '' such that any particle starting from a point within this zone will be absorbed by the boundary before time @xmath138 , while the particles starting outside this zone are still `` alive '' ( and outside this zone ) at @xmath138 ( with probability asymptotically close to one ) .",
    "we note at this stage that this equation coincides with the rg equation for the endpoint magnetization in the rtfic ; i.e. , with the first exchange being @xmath139 .",
    "conversely , a reflecting boundary corresponds to the first transverse field being @xmath140 .",
    "the equivalence is reversed on the other end of the chain @xcite .    in the case of a bias , the probability distribution of the first renormalized bond @xmath141 ( @xmath142 when the bond is along the bias , and @xmath143 when it is against ) satisfies :    @xmath144    which generalizes equation ( [ brsrg ] ) of the zero bias case .      in this section",
    "we recall some results from references @xcite which will be used extensively in this paper , about the large @xmath76 behavior of the solutions of the rsrg equations ( [ rg1 ] , [ brsrgdrift ] ) and discuss them in the context of the sinai model .",
    "we start with the symmetric sinai model ( zero bias , self - dual ) and thus the rg of a single distribution @xmath145 .",
    "one first defines the large - scale variance @xmath146 of the potential as @xmath147 with @xmath148 the distance from @xmath149 to @xmath150 .",
    "since both @xmath148 and @xmath151 are preserved by the rg , @xmath146 is also preserved and determined by the initial model as @xmath152 . in the remainder of the paper we will absorb @xmath146 in @xmath79 and simply study the case @xmath153 .",
    "the units of length are then @xmath154 . to obtain the full results",
    "one must change @xmath155 ( and @xmath156 ) in the following formulae .",
    "the rescaled probability @xmath157 in terms of the rescaled variables @xmath158 satisfies , when laplace transformed in @xmath159 : @xmath160 the fixed point solution @xcite is found to be @xmath161 thus , taking @xmath162 , one finds the physically natural result that , due to the occurrence of long regions which are predominantly up or predominantly down , the coarse - grained probability distribution of barriers in sinai s model is _ exponential _",
