    "with technological advances , hedge funds and similar investment vehicles can simultaneously trade multiple alpha streams .",
    "one immediate question that arises is how to allocate capital to these alphas , or , mathematically speaking , how to determine weights with which the alphas should be combined .",
    "this is an optimization problem , whose solution depends on the precise optimization criterion as well other factors , such as if and how transaction costs are included and modeled .",
    "the second issue is related to crossing trades between alphas .",
    "if , say , within a given hedge fund , strategy a wants to buy $ 1 m of msft while strategy b wants to sell $ 1 m of msft , it makes sense to cross this trade internally ",
    "if the execution platform allows this , that is  as opposed to going to the market as internal crossing amounts to substantial savings in transaction costs .",
    "when internal crossing is employed , portfolio turnover is reduced , so using even the simplest model for transaction costs in portfolio optimization requires accounting for turnover reduction .",
    "as more and more alpha streams are combined , one expects that on average crossing should increase , and therefore the percentage of the dollar turnover with respect to the total dollar investment  which percentage we refer to simply as  turnover \"  is expected to decrease . in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) it was argued that turnover indeed decreases and converges to a non - vanishing limit . generally , it is no easy feat to precisely describe internal crossing and turnover reduction . in a portfolio consisting of a large number of underlying tradable instruments ( _ e.g. _ , stocks ) , precise details of internal crossing depend on the detailed portfolio position and trade data .",
    "the question then is if one can _ model _ expected turnover reduction  on average , that is  with some reasonable assumptions .",
    "one observation is that the more correlated the trades are , the more correlated the alphas are , and the more correlated the trades are , the lower the internal crossing is expected to be .",
    "therefore , while turnover reduction is not necessarily a simple ( _ e.g. _ , linear ) function of alpha correlations , it is clear that it is somehow related to them , so one can try to model turnover reduction based on alpha correlations , which are much more tractable than the position and trade data .",
    "the key observation in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) is that , when the number @xmath3 of alphas is large ",
    "the  large @xmath3 limit \"  the turnover reduction is indeed expected to simplify . in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) a simple model of turnover reduction was discussed , where one assumes a uniform pair - wise correlation @xmath4 between different alphas .",
    "then , when the number of alphas is large , the portfolio turnover has a non - vanishing limit , which is linearly proportional to @xmath4 .    in this note",
    "we propose a model of turnover reduction for a general alpha correlation matrix .",
    "we argue that in the large @xmath3 limit we can model turnover reduction using a spectral decomposition of the correlation matrix  hence the  spectral model \"  using its eigenvalues and eigenvectors . in this limit",
    "we have a non - trivial formula for turnover reduction , which is a generalization of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) .",
    "the complementary factor - model based approach of ( kakushadze , 2014a ) confirms our result here that turnover goes to a finite limit when @xmath3 is large .",
    "to summarize , in this note we give an explicit spectral model of turnover reduction for a general alpha correlation matrix in the limit where the number of alphas is large . in this regime",
    ", this model can be used in estimating transaction costs , and in the problem of portfolio optimization with costs .",
    "the latter application of our model was implemented in ( kakushadze 2015a , 2015b ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "definitions are in section 2 .",
    "section 3 deals with positive - definiteness of the covariance ( or correlation ) matrix .",
    "section 4 discusses our spectral model of turnover reduction and caveats .",
    "our main result is given by eqs .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) , ( [ rhostar ] ) , ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ star.prime ] ) .",
    "we briefly conclude in section 5 .",
    "we have @xmath3 alphas @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "each alpha is actually a time series @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the most recent time .",
    "below @xmath5 refers to @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the sample covariance matrix of the @xmath3 time series @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the corresponding correlation matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .    to begin with , let us ignore trading costs .",
    "alphas @xmath5 are combined with some .",
    "the weights @xmath15 can be negative ( internal crossing ) . ]",
    "weights @xmath15 .",
    "the portfolio profit and loss ( p&l ) is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the investment level ( long plus short ) .",
    "when linear trading costs are included , p&l is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 includes all fixed trading costs ( sec fees , exchange fees , broker - dealer fees , _ etc .",
    "_ ) and linear slippage .",
    "the linear cost assumes no impact , _",
    "i.e. _ , trading does not affect the stock prices . also , @xmath20 is the dollar amount traded , and @xmath21 is the turnover",
    ". let @xmath22 be the turnovers corresponding to individual alphas @xmath5 .",
    "if we ignore turnover reduction resulting from combining alphas , then @xmath23 however , turnover reduction can be substantial and needs to be taken into account . to do this , we need to model turnover when @xmath3 alphas are combined . the basic idea behind such modeling",
    "is discussed in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) , including the assumption ( and its limitations ) that internal crossing can be parameterized by correlations . here , without repeating the arguments of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) , we will discuss a model of turnover reduction based solely on the correlation matrix @xmath12 .",
    "as in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) , in this note our calculations are carried out in the framework where each alpha is traded in its own separate aggregation unit , and matching trades are crossed between separate aggregation units .",
    "generally , the covariance matrix @xmath11 can have the following undesirable properties .",
    "first , it can be ( nearly ) degenerate .",
    "second , it may not be positive ( semi-)definite ( see footnote [ foot.neg.def ] ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be @xmath3 right eigenvectors of @xmath11 corresponding to its eigenvalues @xmath25",
    ", @xmath26 : @xmath27 with no summation over @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the @xmath30 matrix of eigenvectors @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath28th column of @xmath29 is the vector @xmath31 : @xmath32 let @xmath33 be the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues @xmath25 : @xmath34 with no summation over @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 note that , because @xmath37 is symmetric , @xmath29 can be chosen to be orthonormal : @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 then the volatility @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 so , if @xmath11 is not positive semi - definite , _",
    "i.e. _ , if any of its eigenvalues @xmath25 is negative , then the volatility @xmath40 is ill - defined . also , if @xmath11 is ( nearly ) degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ , if any of its eigenvalues @xmath25 is zero ( or small ) , then the corresponding linear combination of alphas given by @xmath42 has zero ( or small ) contribution to the volatility @xmath40 , thereby introducing an instability into the system .    near degeneracy",
    "is caused by alphas that are almost 100% correlated or anti - correlated and can be cured by simply removing such ",
    "redundant \" alphas : is degenerate if and only if the matrix @xmath12 is degenerate : @xmath43 . ] for each kept @xmath5 , each @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is removed so long as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the upper bound on the modulus of the allowed correlations ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath48 ) . in the subsequent sections we will assume that @xmath49 .",
    "however , in practice , near degeneracy is usually caused by the fact that @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath51 , only @xmath52 eigenvalues of @xmath11 are non - zero , while the remainder have  small \" values , which can be positive or negative .",
    "these small values are zeros distorted by computational rounding . ] in such cases , the solution is not to remove any alphas ( as they are not necessarily  redundant \" ) , but to deform the covariance matrix so it is positive - definite .      if one is interested in solving just the positive - definiteness problem , there are various ways of doing this .",
    "a simple method that does not require removing any alphas is as follows ( rebonato and jckel , 1999 ) .",
    "suppose some eigenvalues @xmath25 are negative or zero .",
    "let @xmath53 where one chooses @xmath54 .",
    "next , let @xmath55 finally , let @xmath56 note that @xmath57 is positive definite , and we have @xmath58 _ i.e. _ , this way we obtain a new positive - definite covariance matrix @xmath57 while preserving the diagonal elements of @xmath11 . note that , instead of applying this method to the covariance matrix @xmath11 , one may choose to apply it directly to the correlation matrix @xmath12 , as this method properly preserves the unit diagonal elements of @xmath12",
    "the first observation is that , as we scale @xmath59 , we must have @xmath60 , where @xmath61 . next , let @xmath62 be the eigenvectors of @xmath12 corresponding to the eigenvalues . furthermore",
    ", the basis of alphas @xmath5 is taken ( _ i.e. _ , the signs of @xmath5 are chosen ) such that @xmath63 is maximized ( @xmath64 is the mean correlation ) .",
    "thus , consider the case with uniform correlations @xmath65 , @xmath66 , studied in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) . in this case , in the large @xmath3 limit , the turnover reduction coefficient ( see below ) @xmath67 ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) .",
    "however , if we flip the signs of _ some _ alphas @xmath68 ( and then we must also flip the signs of the corresponding weights @xmath69 ) , which does not change the portfolio turnover , the mean correlation @xmath64 will no longer be equal @xmath4 , hence the aforementioned choice of the basis for @xmath5 .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail and give a precise prescription for fixing this basis below .",
    "for now we will just bear this in mind.[rho.prime ] ] @xmath70 , @xmath71 : @xmath72 let @xmath73 be the @xmath74 matrix of eigenvectors @xmath75 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath76th column of @xmath77 is the vector @xmath75 : @xmath78 @xmath77 can be chosen to be orthonormal : @xmath79 , which fixes the normalization of @xmath75 .",
    "note that @xmath75 form an orthonormal basis of @xmath3-vectors : @xmath80 let @xmath81 ( so @xmath75 are the principal components of @xmath12 ) .",
    "let @xmath82 this is the basis in which @xmath12 is diagonalized : @xmath83 in this basis , the only relevant building blocks constructed solely from @xmath84 and @xmath12 are @xmath85 and @xmath70 , together with scalar invariants of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we have the following spectral model for the turnover : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant , which must be constructed from a scalar invariant of @xmath12 .",
    "the only suitable scalar invariant is the trace .",
    "is not suitable because @xmath21 is not expected to have a peculiar behavior when @xmath12 is nearly degenerate .",
    "furthermore , only the trace - based scalar invariant reproduces the special case discussed below .",
    "also , see below why relative coefficients in ( [ t - sum ] ) do not change the end result .",
    "] then @xmath21 is given by @xmath88 the power of @xmath89 and the overall coefficient are fixed as follows .",
    "let all off - diagonal elements of @xmath12 be identical : @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "also , let all @xmath84 be identical . then , recalling that @xmath92 is the largest eigenvalue , we have @xmath93 which reproduces eq .",
    "( 19 ) in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) .",
    "the spectral model ( [ model ] ) simplifies in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "first , we fix the basis of alphas @xmath5 as follows . under the reflections @xmath94 ( and , consequently , @xmath95 ) , where @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 , @xmath98 , while @xmath70 are invariant",
    ". therefore , we can always choose the basis such that all @xmath99 . in what follows",
    "we always work in this basis . in the large @xmath3 limit , unless @xmath84 have a highly skewed distribution , the @xmath100 contributions in ( [ model ] ) are suppressed ( @xmath91 ) , we have @xmath101 , while the rest of the eigenvectors have zero sums . ] as @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , in the large @xmath3 limit the following simplified model is a good approximation : in eq .",
    "( [ t - sum ] ) , in the large @xmath3 limit the subleading @xmath100 terms are suppressed and we still have ( [ t1 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath103 where @xmath92 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath12 , and @xmath104 is the corresponding eigenvector ( in the basis where all @xmath99 ) normalized such that @xmath105 thus , assuming equal weights @xmath106 with identical @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 where @xmath109 for a generic correlation matrix this quantity is constant with @xmath3 with high t - statistic . for an _ illustrative _ example see figure 1 .",
    "the regression of @xmath110 over @xmath111 ( without intercept ) in figure 1 has f - statistic over @xmath112 ( upper line with circles ) and @xmath113 ( lower line with triangles ) .",
    "this confirms what was argued in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) , that the turnover reduction based on the correlation matrix goes to a non - vanishing limit when @xmath3 is large , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath114 does not vanish in this limit .",
    "the spectral model ( [ model ] ) is exactly that  a _ model_. its premise is that @xmath21 is built solely from building blocks constructed from @xmath84 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is meant to work in the large @xmath3 limit and for generic configurations of @xmath84 .",
    "for example , if all @xmath84 are zero except for @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath117 , so @xmath118 and @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) , then we expect @xmath121 as there is no internal crossing .",
    "( [ model ] ) does not have this property .",
    "in fact , one can attempt to construct such @xmath21 as follows .",
    "let @xmath122 where @xmath123 are coefficients to be determined from the requirement that when @xmath124 we have @xmath125 : @xmath126 this system of @xmath3 equations can be solved if the matrix @xmath127 is invertible .",
    "however , for a generic @xmath12 some of the coefficients @xmath123 will be negative . in any event",
    ", we will not pursue this direction here as our goal is turnover reduction in the large @xmath3 limit for generic configurations of @xmath84 , which brings us to the next  caveat \" .",
    "for some @xmath12 some elements @xmath128 in ( [ t1 ] ) can be small suppressing the contributions of the corresponding @xmath5 .",
    "we can remedy this via the following approximation : @xmath129 _ i.e. _ , in the sum over @xmath130 in ( [ t1 ] ) , @xmath84 are replaced by their cross - sectional average , and ( [ tequal ] ) is reproduced in the case where individual turnovers are uniform .",
    "it might be tempting to replace @xmath114 by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the least - squares solution to the approximate ",
    "eigenvalue \" equation : @xmath133 where the minimization in eq .",
    "( [ minimize ] ) is w.r.t .",
    "@xmath134 , and @xmath135 is the properly normalized unit vector .",
    "however , using @xmath136 can lead to underestimating turnover ( _ i.e. _ , overestimating turnover reduction ) .",
    ", their average or some other value between @xmath114 and @xmath136 . ] in the example of figure 1 , for the upper line ( circles ) we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and for the lower line ( triangles ) we have @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "in fact , there is a more precise relationship between @xmath114 and @xmath136 .",
    "thus , from @xmath141 we have @xmath142 ^ 2 \\psi^{(p ) } \\approx { 1\\over n^2}~\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\widetilde v}_i^{(1)}\\right]^2 \\psi^{(1)}\\ ] ] where we have taken into account that in the large @xmath3 limit the @xmath100 terms in the sum are subleading . combining ( [ sum.v ] ) and ( [ rhostar ] ) , we get @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "( [ sum.v ] ) makes it evident why in the large @xmath3 limit choosing the basis where all @xmath145 is equivalent to maximizing @xmath146 ( see footnote [ rho.prime ] ) .      in real - life trading , when one combines thousands of not - too - correlated alphas ( with some weights ) and trades the so - combined single",
    " unified \" alpha on a single trading platform ( as opposed to trading all these alphas on their own individual execution platforms ) , one gets an automatic bonus : internal crossing of trades between different alphas , hence turnover reduction , which can be substantial . why is this important ? because the weights with which alphas are combined are determined via optimization ( or a similar procedure ) and including trading costs ( and impact ) into this optimization requires modeling turnover reduction , or else the effect of the costs would be ( possibly grossly ) overestimated , thereby resulting in a ( possibly substantially ) suboptimal alpha weights . our main equations ( [ t1 ] ) , ( [ rhostar ] ) , ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ star.prime ] ) model turnover reduction via the first principal component and the corresponding eigenvalue of the alpha correlation matrix , which is general . the model of turnover reduction in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) is a special simple case of our model where all pairwise correlations are uniform",
    "this special case is an unrealistic toy model used in ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) for the purpose of _ illustrating _  via its simplicity  modeling turnover reduction via correlations and the existence of a nonvanishing limit for the turnover when @xmath3 goes to infinity ( as opposed to a naive guess that turnover goes to zero in the large @xmath3 limit ) . however , the toy model of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) is just that  a _ toy _ model .",
    "it is not designed for practical applications  in real life correlations are not uniform .",
    "in contrast , our spectral model we give in this paper is designed precisely with practical applications in mind as it is applicable to a general ( and realistic ) alpha correlation structure . put differently , if one uses eq .",
    "( 20 ) of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) in the general case , it is unclear what @xmath4 in that formula should be .",
    "what we have achieved here is that we give a simple explicit formula for this @xmath4  which we refer to as @xmath114 here  via ( [ rhostar ] ) in the general ( that is , practically interesting ) case .",
    "furthermore , we can not emphasize enough that our result here  that @xmath114 is expressed via the first principal component and the corresponding eigenvalue  only holds in the large @xmath3 limit ; higher principal components are suppressed by powers of @xmath147 , which are small when @xmath3 is sufficiently large . at finite @xmath3",
    "there is no reason for such contributions to be small .",
    "note that this is irrespective of whether we consider the general case or the toy model of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) .",
    "in fact , eq . ( 19 ) of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) expressly shows that unless @xmath3 is large , eq .",
    "( 20 ) of ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) , which is a special case of our model , does not hold .",
    "one evident question arising in the context of the spectral model is out - of - sample stability .",
    "generally , off - diagonal elements of a sample covariance ( correlation ) matrix are not expected to be too out - of - sample stable .",
    "consequently , principal components of a correlation matrix inherit this instability .",
    "nonetheless , the first principal component  which happily is what our spectral model uses  generally is the most out - of - sample stable , with higher principal components substantially more unstable .",
    "prosaically , further mitigating the stability issue is the fact that turnover reduction is important if alphas have substantial turnover in the first instance , _",
    "i.e. _ , the holding periods are short and , consequently , the relevant historical lookbacks are also short . with short lookbacks",
    "one recomputes quantities such as the correlation matrix and its first principal component on correspondingly high frequencies .",
    "in fact , there is yet another way of dealing with the stability issue if one is able to build a multi - factor risk model for alphas along the lines of ( kakushadze , 2014b ) , whereby instead of the sample correlation matrix one uses a constructed one , which by its very construction  if such construction is possible in the first instance , that is  is expected to be substantially more out - of - sample stable .",
    "all in all , in real life one works with what one has got and tries to do one s best with it , be it modeling turnover reduction , alpha covariance matrix , _ etc . _",
    "the upshot is that  just as in theoretical physics ( t hooft , 1974 )  the large @xmath3 limit ( kakushadze and liew , 2014 ) provides a powerful tool in quantitative finance . in this note",
    "we give an explicit spectral model of turnover reduction for a general alpha correlation matrix in the limit where the number of alphas is large . in this regime",
    ", this model can be used in estimating transaction costs , and in the problem of portfolio optimization with costs ( kakushadze , 2015a , 2015b ) .",
    "our spectral model is expected to provide a good approximation for a generic distribution of individual alpha turnovers . in the large @xmath3 limit",
    ", the turnover reduction coefficient based on the spectral model does not appear to vanish but approaches a finite value . in ( kakushadze , 2014a )",
