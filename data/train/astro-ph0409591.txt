    "imaging air erenkov telescopes ( iact ) have proven to be the most successful tool developed so far to explore the @xmath0-ray sky at energies above few hundred gev .",
    "a pioneering generation of installations has been able to detect a handful of sources and to start a whole program of very exciting physics studies .",
    "nowadays a second generation of more sophisticated telescopes is starting to provide new observations .",
    "one of the main characteristics of some of the new telescopes is the potential ability to reduce the gamma ray energy threshold below @xmath1 gev @xcite .    in the framework of the standard model of particle interactions ,",
    "high energy gamma rays traversing cosmological distances are expected to be absorbed through their interaction with the diffuse background radiation fields , or extragalactic background field ( ebl ) , producing @xmath2 pairs .",
    "then the flux is attenuated as a function of the gamma energy @xmath3 and the redshift @xmath4 of the gamma ray source .",
    "this flux reduction can be parameterized by the optical depth @xmath5 , which is defined as the number of e - fold reductions of the observed flux as compared with the initial flux at @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the optical depth introduces an attenuation factor @xmath6 $ ] modifying the gamma ray source energy spectrum .",
    "the optical depth can be written with its explicit redshift and energy dependence @xcite as :    @xmath7 \\label{eq : opd}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 being @xmath9 the angle between the photon directions , @xmath10 is the energy of the ebl photon and @xmath11 is the spectral density at the given z.    for any given gamma ray energy , the gamma ray horizon ( grh ) is defined as the source redshift @xmath12 for which the optical depth is @xmath13 .    in a previous work @xcite , we discussed different theoretical aspects of the calculation of the gamma ray horizon , such as the effects of different ebl models and the sensitivity of the grh to the assumed cosmological parameters .",
    "later , on @xcite we estimated with a realistic simulation the accuracy in the determination of the grh that can be expected from an equal - time observation of a selection of extragalactic sources .",
    "the results obtained in that previous study assumed an observation schedule of equal observing time per source which was set to a canonical value of 50 hours ( rather standard assumption in iacts ) .",
    "although the actual observing time per source might have a lot of constraints ( such as significance of the observation , physics interest of the source , competition in time for the observation of other sources , etc ... ) , in this work we want to explore , taking into account just the unavoidable observability constraints , which time scheduling would optimize the power of this method to extract cosmological parameters and by how much the measurement of these parameters could improve .",
    "one must also take into account that the determination of the cosmological parameters extensively discussed in @xcite is based on the observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which are intrinsically variable .",
    "therefore one of the main parameters to decide which agn is observed at any time will be their flaring state .",
    "for some agn , it is possible to estimate its activity from observations in other wavelength , for instance using the x - ray data @xcite provided by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) @xcite onboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer",
    ". unfortunately , there are a lot of agns for which there is not online data that would allow to infer the flaring state .",
    "actually in the current catalogue of sources that are monitored by asm only 3 of the 22 used on these studies appear .",
    "so that , here we ll present an observational scheduling for the agns in table [ tab : grhvstime ] , which does not care about the activity of the source , and just optimizes the observation time to get the best precision on the cosmological parameter measurements .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section 2 , the expected improvement in the precision of the grh determination as a function of the observation time is discussed .",
    "section 3 deals with the observational constraints in the optimization procedure . in section 4",
    "we describe the optimization technique employed and describe the actual algorithm used .",
    "section 5 presents the results of the optimization procedure in different scenarios considered and finally in section 6 we summarize the conclusions of this study .",
    "to optimize the observation time , the first step is the study of the grh precision as a function of the time that is dedicated for each source . the estimated precision on the grh comes from the extrapolation of the detected spectra of each source by magic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in there , the observation time enters as a multiplicative term to get the number of @xmath0s .    in figure [",
    "fig : grhvstimestat ] , the expected @xmath14 of the grh ( @xmath15 ) using several observation times is shown . in these plots",
    "only the statistical error from the fitting parameter is shown .",
    "that error comes from the error bars in the extrapolated spectra . on the one hand",
    "there is the uncertainty on the flux ( @xmath16 ) that is modeled as `` n '' times the square - root of @xmath16 , which is proportional to @xmath17 being @xmath18 the number of detected @xmath0s . on the other hand , the error on the determination of the energy improves also with @xmath17 if one assumes a gaussian statistic .",
    "therefore , one expects that the @xmath15 decreases with the square - root of time . actually , the extrapolated errors show a good agreement with the blue line that is a fit to :    @xmath19        this latter expression would mean that the @xmath15 can be as small as desired if enough observation time is used .",
    "but it does not represent the reality .",
    "one should also take into account the systematics , which become more and more important when reducing the statistical error .",
    "as it has already been discussed in @xcite the main systematic errors in the grh determination from the simulated experimental data are due to the uncertainty in the global energy scale and to some approximations used to fit the data .",
    "the former is a global systematic , which is absolutely independent and uncorrelated to the observation time , and hence it is not considered here . instead",
    ", the latter should have an impact in the precision of the grh determination as a function of the observation time that may be different for each source .",
    "the main effect of those approximations is that the value of the grh differs slightly from the one that has been introduced .",
    "this difference is added quadratically to the statistical error to account for the systematic difference",
    ". then the figure [ fig : grhvstimestat ] has been repeated and the result for the same 4 sources are shown in figure [ fig : grhvstimesys ] . in that scenario",
    "the curve is fitted to :",
    "@xmath20    where a is the contribution coming from the systematic , which does not decrease with the amount of observation time and therefore becomes important when the time is large .",
    "in fact the parameterization that have been finally used is :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the statistic errors for the grh using 50 hours of observation time and @xmath23 is the constant term of the above mentioned fit ( table [ tab : grhvstime ] ) .    . ]",
    "the aim of this work is the optimization of the time dedicated to each source , to understand which improvement can be obtained in the cosmological measurements .",
    "nevertheless , that time should make sense in the frame of the possible observations performed by an iact such as , for instance , magic . therefore some constraints should be set .",
    "the first constraint is the total amount of time used for those observations .",
    "for that , we used 1000 hours to compare it with the `` 50 h per source '' configuration . on that naive configuration",
    "50 hours were chosen since it is a reasonable time to spend in a single source and it was already a criteria to do the list of the best magic targets in @xcite .",
    "since 20 sources were used ( see reference @xcite ) , it accounts for .",
    "moreover , taking into account that erenkov telescopes have typically observations times of about per year , the limit used could be reached even in one single year . and it is more than acceptable for 2 - 3 years , since agns are one of the main targets of the new generation of iacts .",
    "one of the singularities of the astrophysics field respect to other physics disciplines is that it studies phenomena that can not be generated by the humans in a laboratory .",
    "therefore one has to use what nature provides . in this sense",
    ", iacts can not observe one given source for an infinite time during a year , not even those 1200 hours of observation time , since each source is only visible during some months every year . based on that fact ,",
    "we have computed the amount of time that each source is visible below 45 degrees zenith angle form the magic location . in table",
    "[ tab : grhvstime ] , one can see that time for each of the used agns , actually it holds for the year 2005 and it may change a few percent from year to year due to the full moon periods . to compute the optimal distribution of observation times ,",
    "the constraint `` maxtime '' used for each source is :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the number of hours stated in table [ tab : grhvstime ] .",
    "`` @xmath26 '' is the number of years during which data would be collected and it is set to 3 .",
    "and f is the fraction of the available time during which data would be taken .",
    "it is set to 0.25 and it accounts for bad weather conditions , off data needed for the standard `` on - off '' analysis and time dedicated to other sources or targets of opportunity .",
    ".[tab : grhvstime ] parameters used for the optimization of the time observation dedicated to each source .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is the time independent term contributing to the @xmath15 ( equation [ eq : grhvstime ] ) .",
    "and `` @xmath27 '' is the time that the source is below 45 degrees zenith angle during 2005 at the magic location . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it has already been mentioned in @xcite that a different approach to extract information from the grh can be done : one can use the present constraints of the cosmological parameters to get information on the ebl . in reference",
    "@xcite , the complexity of such analysis is discussed but a simple first step can be done within the scenario of the 4 dimensional fit used for these studies . if one uses the current measurements of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite@xcite ) as external constraints and then optimizes the time distribution to get the minimum error on the fourth parameter which gives a scale factor for the uv background , one can reach a precision of @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth to notice that , despite the distribution of time among them is different , the sources that are still used are roughly the same than the ones for the @xmath32 optimization .",
    "in our previous works on this subject @xcite , it was shown that the precision reached to measure the grh for 50 hours of observation time is not the same for each of the 20 considered extragalactic sources . moreover , it was also clear that the sensitivity to @xmath33 and @xmath34 was larger at high redshift and that the capability to disentangle the cosmological parameters is based on having measurements at low and high redshift .",
    "therefore , it is clear that a cleverer distribution of the observation time would lead to better results .",
    "the optimization of that time distribution pointed out the need of having low redshift measurements ( at z = 0.129 ) as well as others at high redshift ( at z = 1.814 ) . together with these extreme sources ,",
    "the dedication of time at sources that reach the best precision of the grh ( ) would also help to improve the results .    in this work ,",
    "the optimal distribution of the observation time , taking into account scheduling constraints , has been studied by applying a technique based upon a multidimensional constrained minimization using the fisher information matrix .",
    "the results obtained show that a proper scheduling optimized for the determination of the cosmological parameters could allow to reduce by @xmath35 the error on the determination of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and a notable reduction of the @xmath36 contour in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "we are indebted to r.miquel for his advice with the use the fisher information matrix and for providing us with m.speluccis donlp2 code .",
    "we want to thank our colleagues of the magic collaboration for their comments and support .",
