    "in recent times theoretical and experimental investigations of quantum dots is attracting a considerable attention @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested that a novel class of quantum dots @xcite , so - called nuclear - spin - polarization - induced ( nspi ) quantum dots ( qd ) , as well as other nspi low - dimensional electron structures @xcite , could be created through locally polarized nuclear spins .",
    "the main idea of creating nspi structures consists of the following .",
    "electron and nuclear spins interact via the contact hyperfine interaction that can be described by an effective hyperfine field @xmath0 , which acts at spins of electrons and contributes to the electronic hamiltonian through a zeeman - type potential @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath2 is the effective electron @xmath3-factor , @xmath4 is the bohr magneton and @xmath5 is the pauli matrix - vector ) .",
    "the zeeman splitting results in the potential that is attractive for the electrons with one spin projection and repulsive for others . in this model",
    "the energy is shifted by a constant of the order of the fermi energy by means of a gate .",
    "then the potential , created by the inhomogeneous nuclear spin polarization @xmath6 is confining .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath7 .",
    "the idea to create nspi qds has been proposed for the first time by fleurov et al @xcite .",
    "they used a perturbation theory to find the modification of the energy spectrum of a traditional quantum dot due to the polarized nuclear spins .",
    "formalism describing nspi structures was thereafter developed and used in investigations of nspi quantum wires @xcite .",
    "it was established that properties of nspi structures are time - dependent because of nuclear spin diffusion and relaxation processes .",
    "subsequently , this formalism has been used to investigate nspi quantum dots @xcite , nspi quantum rings @xcite , and nspi periodic structures @xcite .",
    "moreover , related low - dimensional electron structures created through modulation of spin - orbit interaction coupling constant have also been considered @xcite .",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that a nspi qd is created in the region of the intersection of the two - dimensional electron gas with cylindrically polarized nuclear spins .",
    "the electron energy levels at any particular time were found as a solution of the 2d radial shrdinger equation with a gaussian confining potential . the 2d radial shrdinger equation ( as well as 3d one ) with a gaussian potential does not give analytic solutions .",
    "different methods were used to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "a parabolic approximation of the gaussian potential has been used in ref .",
    "however , such an approximation is acceptable only for the ground state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of nspi systems by considering nspi qd created through spherically polarized nuclear spins .",
    "time dependence of the electron confining potential of gaussian type is found as a solution of the diffusion equation with a relaxation term and the problem is thus reduced to solving the 3d radial shrdinger equation where the time is involved as a parameter .",
    "for the zero value of the angular momentum we approximate the gaussian potential , which is not exactly solvable , by a multisoliton potential , which is exactly solvable .",
    "the multisoliton potential is obtained by the technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( or equivalently by the method of darboux transformations ) . for other angular momenta",
    "the method gives their singular analogues .",
    "it should be mentioned that the applicability of our approach is not restricted only to nspi qds .",
    "it could be used for describing traditional quantum dots @xcite also .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the basic equations describing nspi qd in sec .",
    "[ basiceq ] . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we present the method of calculations .",
    "time dependence of the electron states in nspi qd is studied in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a semiconductor structure with locally polarized nuclear spins .",
    "there are two main mechanisms leading to the time dependence of the hyperfine field describing the nuclear spin polarization : nuclear spin relaxation and nuclear spin diffusion .",
    "then the evolution of the hyperfine field is governed by the diffusion equation @xmath8 accounting also for the relaxation processes @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is the spin - diffusion coefficient , @xmath10 is the usual three - dimensional laplacian , and @xmath11 is nuclear spin relaxation time @xcite . in the simplest case , we can assume a gaussian form @xmath12 for the initial condition . the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 define the half - width and the amplitude of the initial distribution of the hyperfine field respectively .",
    "then the solution of eq .",
    "( [ diffusion ] ) is : @xmath15 where @xmath16",
    ". the maximum nuclear field in gaas can be as high as @xmath17 in the limit that all nuclear spins are fully polarized @xcite .",
    "this high level of nuclear spin polarization has been achieved experimentally .",
    "for example , the optical pumping of nuclear spins in 2deg has demonstrated the nuclear spin polarization of the order of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a similar high polarization has been created by quantum hall edge states ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "these techniques are developed to allow local polarization and controllability of nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the following electronic hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron effective mass .",
    "the time scale introduced by the nuclear spins is several orders of magnitude larger than the time scale of typical electron equilibration processes .",
    "in such a case the electrons feel a quasi - constant average nuclear field .",
    "this simplifies calculation by avoiding the complications which would appear when solving the schrdinger equation with the time dependence due to polarized nuclei .",
    "we take into account only the electrons with the spins along the @xmath22 axis , for which the effective potential is attractive .",
    "the electron energy levels in nspi qd are determined by the radial schrdinger equation that in appropriate units takes the form @xmath23\\psi_{n , l } ( x , t ) = 0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is related with the radial part of the wave function @xmath25 as follows : @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the energy in dimensionless units , @xmath31 is the energy , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . in the next section",
    "we describe the method we are using to approximate the potential ( [ pot ] ) with the effective hyperfine field @xmath34 given by eq .",
    "( [ b(r , t ) ] ) .",
    "the darboux transformation method also known as the method of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is an effective tool for solving different problems of theoretical and mathematical physics ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "here we are using its property to approximate an interaction between composite particles by a local potential with an experimental accuracy , which previously proved to be very efficient in describing iso - phase ( also known as phase equivalent ) potentials in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "below we outline shortly the main features of the method we need .",
    "suppose one knows all solutions of the schrdinger equation with a given reference potential @xmath35 @xmath36 then , using a simple algorithm , one can construct a huge multiparameter family of exactly solvable potentials .",
    "the solutions @xmath37 of the schrdinger equation with these potentials are obtained by acting on solutions of @xmath38 with a differential operator , @xmath39 . in the simplest case",
    "this is a first order operator @xmath40 where the real function @xmath41 ( known in supersymmetric quantum mechanics as _ superpotential _ ) is defined as the logarithmic derivative of a solution @xmath42 of ( [ init ] ) .",
    "so , one has @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the ground state energy of @xmath38 if it has a discrete spectrum or the lower bound of the continuous spectrum",
    ". the function @xmath42 is called _ transformation _ or _ factorization function _ and @xmath46 its _ factorization constant _ or _",
    "factorization energy_. the potential @xmath47 of the hamiltonian @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is defined in terms of the superpotential @xmath50 as @xmath51 eq . ( [ l1 ] ) defines a first order darboux transformation . in the following",
    "we shall deal with chains of @xmath52 successive transformations of this type .    here",
    "we will use very special chains introduced in @xcite .",
    "they are generated by the following system of transformation functions @xmath53 where @xmath54 are regular ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 irregular ( @xmath57 at the origin .",
    "they have arbitrary eigenvalues @xmath58 and @xmath59 respectively , but always below @xmath45 . if we are interested in the final action of the chain only , the solution @xmath60 of the transformed equation with the hamiltonian @xmath61 corresponding to the energy @xmath62 is given by @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 are wronskians expressed in terms of @xmath56 , denoting symbolically any function of ( [ uv ] ) and of @xmath65 which is a solution of the original schrdinger equation corresponding to the same energy @xmath66 , @xmath67 . in the hamiltonian ( [ final ] )",
    "the transformed potential is @xmath68 for @xmath69 one has @xmath70 and one recovers ( [ v1general ] ) with @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath35 is finite at the origin , @xmath72 behaves as @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the parameter @xmath75 can be associated with the value of the angular momentum in ( [ pot ] ) .",
    "the formulas ( [ psin ] ) and ( [ vn ] ) result from the replacement of a chain of @xmath52 first order transformations by a single @xmath52th order transformation , which happens to be more efficient in practical calculations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained that the transformed jost function @xmath76 is related to the initial jost function @xmath77 by @xmath78 for @xmath79 the first product is unity .",
    "since a jost function is analytic in the upper half of the complex @xmath80-plane ( see e. g. @xcite ) all @xmath81 s must be positive whereas the @xmath82 s can have any sign , so that every positive @xmath83 corresponds to a discrete level @xmath84 of @xmath85 .",
    "in our case we choose @xmath86 so that only exponentials are involved in the final hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , since the potential ( [ pot ] ) is symmetric with respect to inversion @xmath87 we take @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in this case for @xmath90 we get symmetric multisoliton potentials ( see e.g. the first of refs .",
    "moreover , the wronskian from ( [ vn ] ) can be expressed as a sum of hyperbolic cosines @xcite .",
    "for @xmath91 we get singular at the origin analogues of multisoliton potentials . to compare them with the second term of the right hand side of ( [ pot ] ) we have to subtract the centrifugal part and consider @xmath92",
    "the potential @xmath93 depends on @xmath67 parameters @xmath83 and @xmath94 which we fit to the gaussian curve of the second term of the right hand side of ( [ pot ] ) for all values of @xmath95 .",
    "this gives us the time dependence of the parameters @xmath83 and @xmath94 and hence the energy levels @xmath96 .",
    "to get an idea how many functions of type ( [ uv ] ) could be involved in a particular case , we plotted the potentials ( [ vn ] ) for @xmath97 , @xmath98 , ",
    ", @xmath99 , @xmath90 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 in fig . 1 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    it is clearly seen from this figure the solitonic structure of the curves for @xmath103 ( curves 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the result for @xmath104 ( curve 4 ) is not distinguishable of that for @xmath105 and practically coincides with the given gaussian potential curve .",
    "moreover , for @xmath105 the highest energy level is equal to zero with a high precision .",
    "this indicates that this potential has only four discrete levels which are not located near the ionization threshold @xmath106 and possibly one level near this threshold .",
    "another remark worth making is that the long distance behavior of our potential is @xmath107 where @xmath108 whereas the potential ( [ pot ] ) tends to zero much faster , as @xmath109 .",
    "the time dependence of the confining hyperfine field given by eq .",
    "( [ b(r , t ) ] ) determines the time - dependence of the electron energy levels in the nspi qd .",
    "there are two characteristic times in the problem : the diffusion characteristic time @xmath110 and the relaxation characteristic time @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath111 we distinguish diffusive regime , the times @xmath95 such that @xmath112 correspond to intermediate regime , and when @xmath113 we are in relaxation regime . here",
    "@xmath95 is the observation time .",
    "[ fig3 ]    we found that the time - dependence of the energy levels in all regimes are qualitatively similar for nspi qd with spherically symmetric confining potential : the number of energy levels , as well as their depth , decreases with time .",
    "it is interesting to note that the number of energy levels in cylindrically symmetrical nspi qd in the diffusive regime remains constant @xcite , and the number of transverse energy levels in nspi qw in the diffusive regime even increases with time @xcite .",
    "this remarkable fact is related to the symmetry of the confining potential : an increase of the symmetry results in a faster spreading of the confining potential due to the nuclear spin diffusion process .    in order to estimate the accuracy of our approximation , we compared the results obtained by supersymmetric transformations with numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation with the gaussian potential .",
    "we have used the shooting method to solve the radial schrdinger equation , subjecting the solution to the following boundary conditions : @xmath114 and @xmath115 which correspond to a discrete spectrum eigenfunction .",
    "it is convenient to define the function @xmath116 as @xmath117 thus reducing the first of the above conditions to @xmath118 .",
    "figure 2 shows a representative result of our calculations .",
    "the time - dependence of the energy levels was calculated for nspi qd based on gaas with initial half - width @xmath119 m and @xmath120 t , corresponding to 50% nuclear spin polarization , in the intermediate regime , when @xmath121 .",
    "the number of energy levels in the nspi qd decreases with time .",
    "a comparison between analytical and numerical results shows that the method of supersymmetric transformations gives a good approximation for almost all energies except for a tiny interval near @xmath106 .",
    "this is clearly seen from fig .",
    "2(a ) for @xmath122 and fig .",
    "2(b ) for @xmath123 energy levels .",
    "such a difference occurs because of different long distance asymptotics of the gaussian and multisoliton potentials , discussed at the end of the section [ method ] .",
    "faster spreading of nuclear spin polarization in the case of 3d diffusion than in the case of 2d diffusion results in qualitatively different behaviour of the energy spectrum in nspi qds with spherical and cylindrical symmetry in the diffusive regime , as demonstrated in figure 3 for @xmath124 .",
    "it is seen from fig . 3 ( this was exactly proved in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the number of energy levels in the cylindrically symmetrical nspi qd in the diffusive regime is constant in time . in the case of spherically symmetric",
    "nspi qd , the number of energy levels decreases in time .",
    "we have investigated the electronic structure of a quantum dot created through a spherically symmetric local nuclear spin polarization within multisoliton potential approximation obtained by means of darboux transformations .",
    "in particular , the electron energy spectrum of the nspi qd having spherical symmetry was calculated as a function of time .",
    "we found a specific feature of the evolution of such nspi qds - the number of energy levels , as well as their depth , decreases with time in all regimes .",
    "this observation contrast with previously studied cylindrically symmetrical nspi qd .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the approximation of a gaussian potential by a multisoliton potential is much more efficient in comparison with the approximation by a parabolic potential .",
    "the parabolic approximation is acceptable only for the ground state , whereas multisoliton potentials give an excellent agreement with the exact results for all energies except for a tiny interval near @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , for an electron confined by a multisoliton potential the wave function is given analytically .",
    "we would like also to point out that the method presented here can be applied for studying not only nspi qds but it also can be useful for describing , for instance , traditional quantum dots .",
