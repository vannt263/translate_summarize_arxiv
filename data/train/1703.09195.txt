    "dynamical phase transitions have recently been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation .",
    "most commonly , they fall into two main types , both of which involve a quench where a control parameter in the system hamiltonian is abruptly switched from some initial value to a final one , subsequently throwing the system out of equilibrium . the first kind of dynamical phase transition ( dpt - i),@xcite is of the landau type : one waits for the system to relax into a ( quasi-)steady state and extracts a suitable order parameter , usually that associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the system at equilibrium .",
    "this is done as a function of the final value of the quench - control parameter , and if a non - analyticity arises in this function , then a dpt - i has occurred in the system .    , showing three distinct dynamical phases : regular , anomalous , and trivial ( see main text ) .",
    "the dynamical critical line is marked in solid black .",
    "the results for the nonintegrable model are obtained using imps,@xcite while the dynamical critical point for the nn - tfim ( @xmath1 ) is known analytically.@xcite the phase diagram for the fc - tfim ( @xmath2 ) is the main result of this work . ]",
    "a second type of dynamical phase transition is the dpt - ii,@xcite in which non - analyticities in time , or lack thereof , in the loschmidt - echo return rate    @xmath3    characterize different phases , with pre - quench ground state @xmath4 , system size @xmath5 , and post - quench hamiltonian @xmath6 . in the context of the dpt - ii",
    ", an analogy@xcite is made between the thermal partition function and the loschmidt echo @xmath7 , or , equivalently , between the thermal free energy and the loschmidt - echo return rate @xmath8 , where evolution time is now interpreted as a complex inverse temperature .",
    "consequently , if the loschmidt - echo return rate exhibits non - analyticities in evolution time after a quench , this is analogous to non - analyticities in the free energy of a system in equilibrium , which is the hallmark of an equilibrium phase transition.@xcite this dpt - ii , first classified in the seminal work of ref .",

    "[ fig : phasediagram ] , quenching from zero field strength to above a certain _ dynamical _ critical value sets the system in a regular dynamical phase characterized by the appearance of an infinite sequence of cusps with the first cusp appearing before the first minimum in the loschmidt - echo return rate .",
    "these cusps become sharper and temporally less separated with increasing quench strength.@xcite however , for sufficiently long - range interactions ( @xmath21 ) , a new _ anomalous _ dynamical phase@xcite appears whose defining signature is that cusps appear only after the first minimum in the return rate .",
    "in contrast to their regular counterparts , the anomalous cusps separate less in time from each other with decreasing quench strength , with more smooth maxima emerging in the return rate before their onset .",
    "in fact , numerical results@xcite suggest that these cusps arise for arbitrarily small quenches , even though in the framework of imps and time - dependent density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( @xmath22-dmrg ) techniques entanglement buildup prevents access to long - enough evolution times that would be necessary to see the onset of these anomalous cusps for extremely weak quenches .    in this paper",
    ", we turn our attention to the analytically - tractable fully - connected transverse - field ising model ( fc - tfim ) , and investigate the nature of the anomalous phase in a semiclassical approach.@xcite the advantage of this is two - fold : ( i ) in imps , it is intrinsically difficult to include the kac - normalization to ensure intensivity of the energy density for @xmath19 , whereas the fc - tfim allows for investigating the anomalous phase with exact diagonalization ( ed ) and semiclassical techniques .",
    "ed is a technique which is fundamentally different from imps methods , therefore it additionally provides an alternate venue to study the anomalous phase .",
    "( ii ) moreover , from an intuitive point of view , it is logical to consider the limit of infinite - range interactions since it appears that the anomalous phase occurs only for interactions that are sufficiently long - range .",

    "traditionally , the dpt - ii is known to give rise to two phases : one with ( regular ) cusps for quenches across the dpt - ii critical point , and a second with no cusps in the return rate for quenches not crossing it . in ref .  , this was demonstrated in the case of the nn - tfim , where it can be analytically shown that the dpt - ii critical point is @xmath60 .",

    "these cusps characterize the _ anomalous _ dynamical phase , defined by a loschmidt - echo return rate that displays non - analyticities only after its first minimum .",
    "in fact , it can be shown in imps that these anomalous cusps are caused by level crossings within the set of dominant eigenvalues of the mps transfer matrix , which is qualitatively different from the set responsible for the manifestation of the regular cusps and which is dominant for quenches above the dpt - ii critical point . in good agreement with imps data for the lr - tfim , our ed results in fig .",
    "[ fig : anomalous ] for the fc - tfim show such anomalous cusps in the return rate for quenches below @xmath36 . at longer times",
    "they also possess the same period as the order parameter , and , in contrast to the regular cusps , their period increases with quench strength .",
    "moreover , they separate less in time and are preceded by more smooth maxima in the return rate with decreasing quench strength .    however , it is to be emphasized that the distinctive signature of the anomalous phase is that its cusps are delayed in the sense that they always occur after the first minimum of the return rate .",
    "this leads to smooth peaks preceding them , with more such analytic peaks the smaller the quench is .",

    "i.e. for large system sizes and at times when the loschmidt return rate is large , we observed that double - precision ( @xmath67 significant digits ) ed is not sufficient to numerically resolve the loschmidt return rate . in order",
    "to get rid of the numerical noise , we performed the numerical computations with enhanced precision of up to @xmath68 significant digits .",
    "using semiclassical equations of motion and exact diagonalization , we have shown that the fully - connected transverse - field ising model exhibits two distinct dynamical phases , one of which seems to occur as a direct result of the long - range interactions in this model . starting in a @xmath0-symmetry - broken ground state , quenches below the dynamical critical point give rise to the _ anomalous _ phase , whose defining signature is the occurrence of cusps only after the first minimum of the loschmidt - echo return rate .",
    "on the other hand , quenches above the dynamical critical point lead to the regular phase , which shows cusps also before the first minimum of the return rate .",
    "the periods of the cusps in both phases display an intimate connection to the period of the @xmath0 order parameter oscillations .",

    "we now look at the effect of changing the initial condition of our quench .",
    "whereas the main part of the paper treats the case @xmath61 , quenches with different initial values of the transverse - field strength lead to the same phase diagram with the only difference being quantitative because @xmath36 is a function of @xmath31 as expressed in  .",
