    "however , in contrast to the coherent state approach [ cf .",

    "it follows the saddle point prediction only for very weak effective impurity bath interactions .",
    "away from the coherent excitations , the nsct / single - particle excitation approach predicts a spectral gap between the attractive polaron and zero energy , cf .",
    "[ fig : chevy](a ) .",
    "this gap is , however , an artifact of the approximation .",
    "for instance , in a self - consistent t - matrix ( sct ) approach , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chevy](b ) , such a gap is absent . in this approach",
    "an infinite number of particle excitations is taken into account at the basis of a self - consistent calculation of the in - medium t - matrix and impurity self - energy ( the computational details are described in @xcite ) .",
    "the , compared to the nsct approach , increased number of bosonic excitations leads to an additional renormalization of the spectrum .",
    "as one consequence the spectral gap , visible in the nsct approach , is absent and furthermore the repulsive polaron looses additional spectral weight as the feshbach resonance is approached from the side of negative scattering length .",
    "this loss of spectral weight is even more pronounced in the coherent state approach , cf .",
    "[ fig : chevy](c ) , where multiple boson fluctuations lead to the destruction of the attractive polaron peak .",
    "in contrast to the coherent state approach , the single - particle excitation and sct approaches do not describe the formation of the series of bound states . in the case of the single - particle excitation approach",
    "this fact is simply explained since only one boson excitation is allowed in the wave function . the sct approach , which allows in principle more than one bosonic excitation , yet does not reveal higher order bound states .",
    "we attribute this fact to the specific momentum structure generated by the sct approach which only allows for fluctuations in the pairing channel of the interaction vertex .",
    "the particular correlations captured by this momentum structure seems to be insufficient for a description of the multiple bound state formation .",
    "finally we note that both the sct and the coherent state approach show a more pronounced repulsive polaron peak as compared to the single - particle excitation approach which can be tested by radio - frequency spectroscopy of impurities immersed in a bec of ultracold atoms ."

    "<S> indeed , the ansatz   is related to a variational wave function which is based to an expansion in terms of single particle excitations . in the context of cold atoms , </S>",
    "<S> it was first introduced in the work by chevy for fermionic systems @xcite , and later generalized to bosonic systems @xcite .    to connect our results to previous work we present here an extension of the equilibrium approach to real - time dynamics by studying the time - dependent variational wave function @xmath81 this wave - function accounts for a single phonon excitation on top of the unperturbed bec state . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the excitation spectrum of the system from the dynamical overlap @xmath82 as obtained from the equation of motions of the variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz is naturally connected to the coherent state approach as an expansion in low occupation numbers , which justifies the validity of eq .   in the limit of low densities . </S>",
    "<S> while in the weak coupling regime the simple ansatz reproduces the predictions using the coherent state approach , it fails to describe the intricate many - body physics in regimes where multiple boson excitations become relevant ( for a comparison see the sm @xcite ) .    , for attractive and repulsive interactions , ( a ) @xmath83 , ( b ) @xmath84 , ( c ) @xmath85 , obtained by the coherent state approach   and the single - excitation expansion   ( yellow solid and red dashed lines , respectively ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the coherent states approach   and the single - excitation expansion   can be highlighted when the time evolution of the number of phonon excitations @xmath86 is compared , where @xmath87 denotes the expectation value with respect to the chosen variational state . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phnum ] we show @xmath88 for attractive and repulsive interactions . on the attractive side </S>",
    "<S> both approaches predict a saturation of the phonon number in the long time limit , see panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phnum ] . in the single - excitation expansion ( dashed lines ) , </S>",
    "<S> the number of excitations is restricted to one . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation of eq .   becomes apparent when comparing it to the coherent state approach ( solid lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that already for moderate attractive coupling strength the number of phonons exceeds one . </S>",
    "<S> hence , due to the restriction in the number of excitations for the ansatz  , both approaches agree only in the initial short time evolution .    on the repulsive side </S>",
    "<S> the coherent state approach predicts oscillations of the number of phonons in the long time limit , see panel ( c ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phnum ] . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations appear due to the competition between the many - body polaron branch and the few - body bound states in real time . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the single - excitation expansion these oscillations decay gradually and in the long time limit , the number of excitations saturates at one , reflecting the formation of a single molecular state .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that similar to the time - dependent coherent state approach presented in this letter , a self - consistent t - matrix approach @xcite also accounts for an infinite number of bosonic excitations . using this diagrammatic approach </S>",
    "<S> it had been found that the inclusion of multiple boson excitations has a profound influence on the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however multiphonon bound states have not been observed in this earlier work . </S>",
    "<S> yet we emphasize that when considering only moderate interaction strengths or short - time evolution , expansions in terms of a few particle excitations such as eq .   remain a viable approach . </S>",
    "<S> they correctly describe the weakly attractive and repulsive polaron branches as well as the one - boson bound state present in the spectrum sufficiently far away from the feshbach resonance .    </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrated both the disappearance of the sharp quasiparticle spectral feature at strong coupling and the presence of a novel type of excitations in which several bogoliubov quasiparticles are bound to the impurity particle . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis highlights the importance of quasiparticle scattering processes that are not present in the commonly used frhlich model . </S>",
    "<S> they result in strong short distance correlations that give rise to efimov type physics of multi - particle bound states and play a crucial role in suppressing the quasiparticle spectral weight close to the feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> our work opens new directions for studying non - perturbative phenomena in bose polarons at strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that new insight into such systems can be gained by extending our analysis to more sophisticated approaches such as gaussian variational wave functions  @xcite and renormalization group analysis  @xcite . </S>",
