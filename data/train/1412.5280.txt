    "interacting fermi systems appear across a broad range of physics with various interaction strengths and understanding of their properties is of fundamental importance .",
    "when there is a weak attraction between two components of fermions , the system is unstable toward the formation of cooper pairs and becomes a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid . on the other hand ,",
    "when the attraction is sufficiently strong , the two components of fermions form a diatomic molecule which undergoes the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and the system becomes the superfluid again . because there is no sharp distinction between the condensation of loosely bound cooper pairs and tightly bound molecules ,",
    "the above two types of superfluids can be smoothly connected with increasing the attraction .",
    "indeed , it was shown that the ordinary mean - field wave function smoothly interpolates the bcs and bec superfluids which constitutes the celebrated bcs - bec crossover theory providing unified understanding of fermi superfluids  @xcite . since",
    "then the bcs - bec crossover in two - component fermi gases has been the subject of extensive studies  @xcite and now recognized as a well - established phenomenon , in particular , because of its experimental realization with ultracold atoms utilizing feshbach resonances  @xcite .    yet",
    "richer crossover physics may be found in three - component fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "when an attraction between three components of fermions is weak , two of them form cooper pairs and condense while there is always one component that remains unpaired and forms a fermi sea  @xcite . then , with increasing the attraction , loosely bound cooper pairs will smoothly evolve into tightly bound molecules according to the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "but , what will happen to unpaired fermions ?",
    "a new possibility recently proposed is that unpaired fermions forming a fermi sea smoothly change their character from atoms to triatomic molecules ( trimers ) with increasing the attraction  @xcite . at first glance",
    ", it may seem surprising and even impossible because an atom and trimer have different quantum numbers ( particle numbers ) and thus can not be smoothly connected .",
    "however , because the condensation of cooper pairs or molecules violates the particle number conservation in units of two , the atom and trimer are actually indistinguishable in a superfluid state and thus can be smoothly connected ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : continuity ] ) .",
    "this new type of crossover physics potentially emerging in three - component fermi gases is termed an `` atom - trimer continuity '' in analogy with the `` quark - hadron continuity '' in a superfluid nuclear matter where deconfined quarks with three colors are considered to smoothly evolve into confined baryons with decreasing the nuclear density  @xcite .    ]",
    "the atom - trimer continuity was originally inspired by exploring the universal phase diagram of a three - component fermi gas in the vicinity of a narrow feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "it was found there by controlled analyses that the unpaired fermi sea coexisting with condensed pairs is composed of atoms in the weak coupling dense limit while composed of trimers in the strong coupling dilute limit . whether they are actually smoothly connected or not ,",
    "however , still remains unestablished because of the lack of a unified theoretical framework that smoothly interpolates the above two limits .",
    "this difficulty largely originates from the fact that , unlike the bcs - bec crossover for two - component fermi gases , the ordinary mean - field approximation does not work for three - component fermi gases because it completely misses three - body correlations playing an essential role here  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is challenging but highly desired to develop a new crossover theory suitable for three - component fermi gases .",
    "important progress toward such a goal is to be made in this letter by studying the corresponding polaron problem in which a single impurity atom of one component interacts with condensed pairs of the other two components of fermions with equal populations .",
    "as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bcs - bec crossover in two - component fermi gases is often studied across a broad feshbach resonance , where a three - component fermi gas , however , does not have a universal many - body ground state because of the thomas collapse  @xcite . a minimal extension to cure this problem",
    "is to consider a narrow feshbach resonance which is characterized by the nonzero resonance range as well as the @xmath0-wave scattering length  @xcite .",
    "assuming the same inter - component interaction for all possible three pairs  @xcite , the polaron problem of a three - component fermi gas in the vicinity of a narrow feshbach resonance is described by the two - channel hamiltonian , @xmath1 , which consists of the canonical part @xmath2 \\notag\\\\   & + \\frac{g}{2\\sqrt{v}}\\sum_{i , j , k}\\sum_{{{\\bm{p}}},{{\\bm{p } } } }   \\left[\\epsilon_{ijk}\\,\\phi_i^{\\dagger}({{\\bm{p}}})\\psi_j({{\\bm{p}}})\\psi_k({{\\bm{p}}}-{{\\bm{p } } } )   + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 being the antisymmetric tensor and the particle number operator for the @xmath4th component of fermions : @xmath5.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 create fermionic atoms and bosonic molecules with momentum @xmath9 and obey the usual ( anti)commutation relations , while @xmath10 is the single - particle kinetic energy with the same mass @xmath11 assumed for all three components of fermions .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath12 is introduced to only the first two components of fermions and chosen so that each component has the fixed particle number density of @xmath13 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath14 .",
    "the bare detuning @xmath15 of a molecule @xmath16 and its coupling @xmath17 to two atoms @xmath18 are related to the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath19 and the resonance range @xmath20 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and the momentum cutoff @xmath24 is sent to infinity at the end of calculations .",
    "we now develop a variational approach aimed at a unified theoretical framework that smoothly interpolates the polaronic atom and trimer in a superfluid state . because the first two components of fermions have equal populations and attract each other , they form cooper pairs and condense . in order to describe them ,",
    "we adopt the ordinary mean - field wave function @xmath25   \\prod_{{\\bm{p}}}\\left[u_{{\\bm{p}}}+v_{{\\bm{p}}}\\psi_1^{\\dagger}({{\\bm{p}}})\\psi_2^{\\dagger}(-{{\\bm{p}}})\\right]|0{\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the variational parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 are determined so as to minimize the energy expectation value @xmath29 under constraints @xmath30 for all @xmath9 to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath31 . with the method of lagrange multipliers , we find @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the quasiparticle energy and the gap parameter @xmath35 as well as the chemical potential @xmath12 simultaneously solves the gap equation    [ eq : mean - field ] @xmath36 and the particle number density equation @xmath37    these two coupled mean - field equations qualitatively describe the bcs - bec crossover of the condensed pairs with increasing the attraction @xmath38  @xcite and , furthermore , become exact in the narrow resonance limit @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "when a single impurity atom of the third component with momentum @xmath40 is added to the above superfluid state ( [ eq : superfluid ] ) , the simplest trial wave function to start with is @xmath41 while this trial wave function seems to describe an atom - like impurity on top of the superfluid state , it can also be viewed as a trimer - like impurity at the same time because the particle number in the superfluid state fluctuates in units of two .",
    "this peculiarity becomes evident by decomposing the superfluid wave function @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : atom ] ) into a superposition of fixed particle number wave functions : @xmath43^n|0{\\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the pair creation operator defined by @xmath44 here , if one state @xmath45^n|0{\\rangle}$ ] is viewed as the atom - like impurity , then another superposed state @xmath46\\big[\\phi_3^{\\dagger}({{\\bm{0}}})\\big]^n|0{\\rangle}$ ] can be viewed as the trimer - like impurity in which the atom - like impurity is dressed by a zero - momentum pair extracted from the background condensate ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : continuity ] ) .",
    "in particular , because of the existence of the latter component in the atom - like wave function ( [ eq : atom ] ) , it can hybridize with the following trimer - like wave function , i.e. , @xmath47 : @xmath48|{\\mathrm{sf}}{\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this trimer - like wave function is constructed so that it becomes the most general three - body wave function in the zero density limit @xmath49 and thus is capable of exactly reproducing the trimer formation in the vacuum .",

    "( [ eq : atom ] ) as is evident from its decomposition ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) and , consequently , the above two wave functions have no overlap @xmath51 .",
    "with all these preparations , we finally propose the ansatz @xmath52 as a possible crossover wave function that smoothly interpolates atom - like @xmath53 and trimer - like @xmath54 impurities in a superfluid state and refer to it as a polaronic atom - trimer state .    at this point , it is worthwhile to contrast our polaronic atom - trimer state ( [ eq : atom - trimer ] ) with the usual polaron in a two - component fermi gas  @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "a single impurity atom is dressed by a pair of particle and hole excited from the background fermi sea  @xcite and thus distinct from the trimer  @xcite , while in the former , a single impurity atom is dressed by a pair of two particles extracted from the background condensate and thus indistinguishable from the trimer .",
    "a similar situation can be found in bose - fermi mixtures where fermionic atoms and molecules are indistinguishable in the presence of condensed bosons  @xcite . in principle , the single impurity atom can be further dressed by two or more condensed pairs to form a pentamer - like or larger molecule , but their contributions to the impurity wave function are expected to be insignificant because their formations are not favored by the pauli exclusion principle between the same component of fermions .",

    "<S> recently it has been proposed that three - component fermi gases may exhibit a new type of crossover physics in which an unpaired fermi sea of atoms smoothly evolves into that of trimers in addition to the ordinary bcs - bec crossover of condensed pairs . here </S>",
    "<S> we study its corresponding polaron problem in which a single impurity atom of one component interacts with condensed pairs of the other two components with equal populations . by developing a variational approach in the vicinity of a narrow feshbach resonance , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the impurity atom smoothly changes its character from atom to trimer with increasing the attraction and eventually there is a sharp transition to dimer . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent polaronic atom - trimer continuity can be probed in ultracold atoms experiments by measuring the impurity spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> our novel crossover wave function properly incorporating the polaronic atom - trimer continuity will provide a useful basis to further investigate the phase diagram of three - component fermi gases in more general situations . </S>"
