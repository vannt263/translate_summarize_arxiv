    "in recent years there is a growing interest in studies of neutron - star pulsations .",
    "this is related to a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , the recently discovered high frequency oscillations of electromagnetic radiation during giant flares may be associated with the pulsations of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "second , the gravitational - wave detectors , which will be able to detect gravitational radiation from isolated pulsating neutron stars , are under construction @xcite .    for interpretation of the observations , it is important to have a well - developed theory of neutron - star pulsations .",
    "the construction of such a theory is complicated by the fact that the baryons in neutron - star cores can be in superfluid state @xcite .",
    "thus , to study the pulsations , one has to use a hydrodynamics describing mixtures of superfluid liquids .",
    "there is a substantial body of literature , devoted to pulsations of superfluid neutron stars ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "all these papers deal with the nucleon @xmath0 matter composed of neutrons ( @xmath1 ) , protons ( @xmath2 ) , and electrons ( @xmath3 ) with possible admixture of muons ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "most of them study pulsations at zero temperature ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper we for the first time investigate dynamic properties of superfluid _ nucleon - hyperon _ matter in the cores of massive neutron stars , composed , in addition to neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons , of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons ( @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively ) . for that",
    ", we employ the relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite , describing a superfluid nucleon - hyperon mixture at _ arbitrary _ temperature .",
    "we study the simplest pulsations in such matter ",
    "sound modes , how they travel and how they damp . within this simple example",
    "we demonstrate , in particular , that the characteristic damping times of pulsations , calculated self - consistently in the frame of superfluid hydrodynamics , can differ by several orders of magnitude from those calculated using the nonsuperfluid hydrodynamics ( in the latter case the effects of superfluidity are taken into account only at calculating kinetic coefficients ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an overview of the main reactions of particle mutual transformations in the nucleon - hyperon matter . in sec .",
    "iii we briefly discuss the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics describing superfluid nucleon - hyperon mixture . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the sound modes in such matter neglecting dissipation . in sec .",
    "v we calculate the damping times of sound modes due to the nonequilibrium reactions ( [ s])([ll ] ) ( see sec .",

    "the most effective weak processes in nucleon - hyperon matter are the following nonleptonic reactions @xcite @xmath12 the full thermodynamic equilibrium implies , in particular , the equilibrium with respect to these reactions , @xmath13 in this case the average number of direct reactions in unit volume per unit time is equal to the number of inverse reactions . in eqs .",

    "( [ s_eq ] ) and ( [ l_eq ] ) do not hold in the perturbed matter ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , so that the numbers of direct and inverse reactions are not equal .",
    "the nonequilibrium reactions ( [ s])([ll ] ) act to return the system to the equilibrium state .",
    "this leads to dissipation of mechanical energy , accumulated in the matter .",
    "along with the reactions ( [ s])([ll ] ) there is a number of weak reactions with leptons .",
    "the leptonic reactions ( e.g , the direct and modified urca processes with electrons or muons ) are much slower in comparison to the reactions ( [ s])([ll ] ) . in the interesting range of parameters ( temperatures and pulsation frequencies )",
    ", they can not influence substantially chemical composition of the perturbed matter and will be neglected in what follows .",
    "however , we assume that the unperturbed matter satisfies the equilibrium conditions with respect to these reactions , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the equilibrium chemical potentials for electrons and muons , respectively .",
    "in addition to the processes described above , there is a fast nonleptonic reaction due to the strong interaction of baryons , @xmath27 we assume that the perturbed matter is always in equilibrium with respect to this reaction @xcite , @xmath28 it follows from the condition ( [ eqfast ] ) , that the chemical potential disbalances for all the four reactions ( [ s])([ll ] ) coincide , @xmath29 now the equilibrium conditions ( [ s_eq ] ) and ( [ l_eq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath30 below we denote the difference between the average number of direct and inverse reactions ( [ s]),@xmath18,([ll ] ) , occurring in the unit volume per unit time , by @xmath31,@xmath18,@xmath32 , respectively . in this paper",

    "limit of _ fast _ reactions can be considered in a similar way . as we have already discussed above , at @xmath192",

    "these velocities are constrained by the only one condition ( [ sound55 g ] ) ( the condition ( [ sound4 g ] ) is not applicable ; it is valid only if all baryon species are superfluid ) .",
    "thus , the number of sound modes remains equal three .",
    "then , at @xmath198 and at @xmath199 a motion with , respectively , three ( @xmath80 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 ) and two ( @xmath80 and @xmath201 ) velocities is possible .",
    "these velocities are related by the condition ( [ sound55 g ] ) .",

    "finally , at @xmath194 all baryon species are normal and move with the same velocity @xmath80 . since this velocity is not constrained , there is ( as it should be ) only one sound mode .",
    "in the previous section we analysed the sound modes in the limit of _ slow _ and _ fast _ reactions neglecting dissipation . in this section we allow for a weak dissipation in these limiting cases , which is due to the shear viscosity and nonequilibrium processes ( [ s])([ll ] ) . our aim is the calculation of the characteristic damping times @xmath203 of sound waves ( the so called e - folding times ) .",

    "then , solving the system of equations ( [ delta p])([sound3 g ] ) , one can find the small complex correction @xmath206 to the speed of sound @xmath167 , which is related to the damping time @xmath203 by @xmath207 another way to calculate @xmath203 is to use the effective bulk viscosity formalism @xcite , similar to how it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath47 matter .",
    "we calculated @xmath203 by both methods described above .",
    "however , here we present the most simple , third method of calculation .",
