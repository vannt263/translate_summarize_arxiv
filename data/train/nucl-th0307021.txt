    "the effect of breakup of weakly bound projectiles on fusion has been extensively investigated in recent years both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , but there is not yet a definitive conclusion .",
    "experimental works discuss the effect of breakup on fusion by comparing experimental fusion excitation functions to either realistic theoretical predictions which do not include couplings to the breakup channels , e.g. @xcite , or to experimental fusion excitation functions of well - bound ( reference ) projectiles for which the breakup is expected to be weak , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in fusion of weakly bound nuclei , two independent fusion processes can be distinguished , namely complete fusion and incomplete or partial fusion .",
    "the total fusion is the sum of these processes ( complete + incomplete ) .",
    "these two types of fusion processes are connected to the dynamics of the projectile fragments .",
    "a clear definition of complete and incomplete fusion is necessary to compare theoretical predictions to experimental data .",
    "theoreticians , e.g. @xcite , and experimentalists , e.g. @xcite , give different definitions in the literature .",
    "from a theoretical point of view we think that , strictly speaking , complete fusion refers to the capture of all the projectile fragments ( from bound and breakup states ) by the target , whereas the incomplete fusion is related to the capture of only some of those fragments .",
    "experimentalists @xcite tend to define complete and incomplete fusion as absorption of all the charge of the projectile and of a part of that charge , respectively .",
    "these definitions are only equivalent to the strictly theoretical ones if all the projectile fragments are charged ( e.g. , @xmath3li=@xmath4+@xmath5 or @xmath6li=@xmath4+@xmath7 ) , but this is not the case for projectiles like @xmath8be@xmath9 or @xmath10be@xmath11be@xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note that in fusion experiments with @xmath8be @xcite and @xmath10be @xcite it is still unclear what happens to the valence neutron after the reaction .",
    "if we follow the experimental definitions , the total and complete fusion would be the same for the reaction @xmath10be + @xmath2bi @xcite , since only the capture of the stable @xmath13be core has been observed so far .",
    "most experiments @xcite have only measured the total fusion , whereas in @xcite the complete fusion was distinguished from the incomplete one .",
    "the importance of distinguishing between complete and incomplete fusion in order to observe complete fusion suppression above the barrier for @xmath0li + @xmath2bi was pointed out in @xcite .    since the calculation of the complete and the incomplete fusion cross section following either the strictly theoretical definitions or the experimental ones is extremely complex ,",
    "simplifying models have been used up to now @xcite . using full coupled channels calculations ,",
    "complete fusion was interpreted in @xcite as absorption from projectile bound states , and as incomplete fusion that from unbound states . in our approach in @xcite , the total fusion cross section for @xmath10be + @xmath14pb was unambiguously ( referred to the strictly theoretical definition ) calculated , but this was not the case for the complete and incomplete fusion independently .",
    "the unambiguous prediction of complete and incomplete fusion cross sections is still a challenge for all current fusion models @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we interpreted in @xcite the total fusion of @xmath10be on @xmath14pb as the absorption of the center of mass ( c.m . ) of the projectile from either its bound or breakup states . since the mass of the @xmath13be core is much larger than the neutron mass , such an absorption could ensure that at least the charged core is captured .",
    "however , we doubt that this approach can be used to study the total fusion of the two - cluster projectiles @xmath0li because the two charged fragments ( @xmath3li=@xmath4+@xmath5 and @xmath6li=@xmath4+@xmath7 ) have similar masses . in this case , the capture of the c.m . of the projectile is not necessarily connected to the capture of the charged fragments .",
    "therefore , we will use for the present reactions two optical potentials for the nuclear interaction between the projectile fragments and the target . at the same time , the short - ranged imaginary fusion potential defined in the c.m .",
    "coordinate of the projectile and used in @xcite , will be removed .",
    "the imaginary part of those optical potentials will also be short - ranged ( inside the coulomb barriers ) to ensure that the absorption is associated with fusion channels only .",
    "the present work particularly aims at ( i ) investigating the relative importance of breakup and bound - state structure effects ( i.e. ground - state reorientation couplings , coupling to the bound excited state ( @xmath6li ) and bare potential ) for the total fusion of @xmath0li on @xmath1co and @xmath2bi targets around the coulomb barrier , ( ii ) clarifying whether or not the enhancement or suppression effect of breakup is shown in total fusion , and ( iii ) testing the model with recent experimental data @xcite . in sect .",
    "ii , the theoretical formalism is presented , whereas the results and the discussion are shown in sect .",
    "we draw conclusions in sect .",
    "calculations of total fusion cross sections for @xmath0li on @xmath1co and @xmath2bi are carried out using a three - body model @xcite with a new cdcc @xcite method of calculating fusion , i.e. with short - range fusion potentials for each fragment separately .",
    "full coupled channels calculations are performed with the code fresco @xcite .",
    "the set of coupled equations @xcite for the projectile - target radial wave functions is solved with the usual scattering boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the total fusion cross section is calculated in terms of that amount of flux which leaves the coupled channels set ( total absorption cross section ) because of the short - ranged imaginary parts @xmath15 of the optical potentials between the projectile fragments and the target .",
    "this guarantees that at least one of the charged fragments of the projectile is captured .",
    "the same woods - saxon potential @xmath16 with parameters @xmath17 mev , @xmath18 fm , and @xmath19 fm is used for the imaginary part of the two optical potentials .",
    "the results depend only very weakly on the parameters of this potential , as long as it is well inside the coulomb barrier and strong enough for the mean - free path of the projectile inside the barrier to be much smaller than the dimensions of @xmath16 .",
    "the fusion cross sections for @xmath17 mev are those for @xmath20 mev changed by @xmath21 .",
    "the use of a short - ranged imaginary potential is equivalent to the use of an incoming boundary condition inside the barrier for each fragment to study fusion @xcite .    in calculations of total fusion cross sections ,",
    "we simultaneously include ( i ) the breakup of the projectile caused by inelastic excitations to different partial waves in the continuum ( non - resonant and resonant breakup ) , induced by the projectile fragments - target interactions ( coulomb+nuclear ) , and ( ii ) all continuum ( bound - continuum and continuum - continuum ) and reorientation couplings . by breakup we mean the elastic dissociation of @xmath0li into two fragments only , namely alpha + deuteron for @xmath3li and alpha + triton for @xmath6li , and not further breakup of the deuteron or triton .",
    "the reorientation couplings refer to the couplings of the quadrupole term of the projectile fragment - target potentials , among the projectile target partial waves , for the projectile in its ground state . since we will first focus on effect of projectile excitation",
    ", we will not include transfer or inelastic channels of the target",
    ". the target will be regarded as a spherical nucleus with spin zero .",
    "afterwards , we will estimate the effect of target excitations on the total fusion cross section .",
    "we expect both that such an effect could be important at energies just around the coulomb barrier and that it is similar for the two lithium isotopes .",
    "we would like to stress that in the present calculations the imaginary parts of the off - diagonal couplings have been neglected , while the diagonal couplings include imaginary parts .",
    "the reason for not including the imaginary part of the off - diagonal couplings is that they produce numerical instabilities .",
    "the hermiticity of the symmetric breakup matrix is violated when large values of off - diagonal imaginary couplings are included .",
    "those imaginary couplings describe absorption occurring during the transitions between the channels . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect that these couplings weakly affect the total fusion cross section . in that reference",
    ", it was shown that the imaginary off - diagonal coupling redistributes , among the elastic and nonelastic channels , the flux that has already penetrated the coulomb barrier .",
    "the total fusion cross section , however , remained unchanged .",
    "in addition to the coulomb interaction , the global woods - saxon parametrization given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the christensen and winther potential is used for the real part of the optical potentials between the projectile fragments ( @xmath3li=@xmath22+@xmath5 and @xmath6li=@xmath4+@xmath7 ) and the target .",
    "those potentials are given in table i. the projectile - target bare potential for a central collision is calculated by the single - folding of the projectile fragments - target monopole ( real ) interactions with the @xmath0li ground - state densities defined in terms of the ground - state wave functions . in the following , by coulomb barrier @xmath23 we mean the barrier of that potential .",
    "the couplings are taken into account up to a projectile - target radial distance @xmath24 fm .",
    "partial waves for the projectile - target relative motion up to only @xmath25 ( partial - wave total fusion cross section @xmath26 mb ) are included in the calculation .",
    ".potentials between the projectile fragments and the target are shown along with those to describe the projectile states ( g.s .- ground state , res .-",
    "resonances , b.s .- bound states ) .",
    "the potential depths are given in mev , and the radii and diffusenesses in fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      fig .",
    "5 shows , like fig .",
    "2 , total fusion excitation functions for @xmath3li+@xmath2bi ( full dots with solid curve ) and @xmath6li+@xmath2bi ( full triangles with dashed curve ) , which are normalized with the corresponding cross sections without breakup . the incident energies are also normalized with the barrier ( @xmath27 mev for @xmath3li , and @xmath28 mev for @xmath6li ) of the calculated bare potentials .",
    "these barriers are similar to those measured in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath29 mev for @xmath3li , and @xmath30 mev for @xmath6li ) and to those calculated @xcite ( @xmath31 mev for @xmath3li , and @xmath32 mev for @xmath6li ) with the double - folding procedure .",
    "fusion enhancement occurs at energies just around the barrier , while breakup has very little effect ( an enhancement by @xmath33 ) on total fusion at energies well above the barrier .",
    "the difference between the two @xmath34-breakup thresholds for @xmath0li is also revealed in the value of their enhancement factors around the barrier .",
    "these factors also depend strongly on the decreasing incident energy below the barrier . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "2 , we can observe that the breakup effect on total fusion is stronger for the @xmath2bi target than for @xmath1co , as expected .",
    "li+@xmath2bi ( full dots ) and @xmath6li+@xmath2bi ( full triangles ) . see text for further details.,width=327 ]    in fig .",
    "6 , the total fusion excitation functions of the two reactions are compared to each other ( as in fig .",
    "3 ) . it is observed that the differences between the total fusion excitation functions , caused by the bound - state structure effects of @xmath0li , are very small and similar to those with the @xmath1co target .",
    "the effect of the @xmath6li ground - state reorientation couplings ( comparing the dashed curve to the dash - dotted one ) and of the coupling to its bound @xmath35 excited state ( comparing the dashed curve to the dotted one ) on total fusion are also very weak .    li+@xmath2bi .",
    "see text for further details.,width=327 ]    in fig .",
    "6 , it is also shown that the breakup increases the difference between the total fusion cross sections for @xmath0li at energies just around the barrier . at energies well above the barrier ,",
    "the two systems show very similar total fusion excitation functions .",
    "6 also indicates , like fig .",
    "3 , that the breakup causes the difference between the total fusion cross sections of @xmath0li .",
    "the experimental data are from ref .",
    "@xcite . see text for further details.,width=327 ]    we also estimated the effect of target excitations on total fusion .",
    "it was done in the same way as for @xmath1co .",
    "since the couplings to the first two excited states of single - particle structure is rather weak @xcite , we only include couplings to the collective multiplet [ @xmath14pb(3@xmath36)@xmath371h@xmath38@xmath39 ( table iii ) with energies ranging from 2.493 to 2.741 mev @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume collective transitions to these excited states due to their complexity ( combined collective and single - particle dynamics ) .",
    "total fusion cross sections remain the same for energies well above the barrier , whereas they are increased by @xmath40 around the barrier for both @xmath3li and @xmath6li .",
    "7 shows a comparison between the calculated ( full squares and triangles ) total fusion excitation functions including the effect of target excitations and the experimental data @xcite ( open circles and squares ) .",
    "the experimental data for @xmath3li ( upper part , open circles ) are well reproduced , but it is not the case for @xmath6li ( lower part , open squares ) .",
    "theoretical results for @xmath6li underestimate the experimental values at energies around the barrier , but the agreement is good at energies well above the barrier .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0li+@xmath1co @xcite , experimental total fusion cross sections for @xmath6li+@xmath2bi are larger than those for @xmath3li+@xmath2bi around the barrier .",
    "the experiment @xcite shows that it is because the direct production of @xmath41po evaporation residue ( contributing to the incomplete fusion yield ) is notably larger with @xmath6li than with @xmath3li .",
    "these evaporation residues can be produced by the capture of ( i ) the deuteron or proton ( proton capture following dissociation of @xmath42 ) for @xmath3li , and of ( ii ) the triton for @xmath6li .",
    "a stripping breakup process @xcite does not seem to explain the larger production of @xmath41po with @xmath6li , because the triton binding energy in @xmath6li is larger than the deuteron one in @xmath3li .",
    "it would be interesting to measure deuteron and triton transfer cross sections for these reactions to clarify the reason for the difference of their @xmath41po yields .",
    "we would like to stress that couplings to these transfer channels were not included in the present calculations .",
    "as an example , fig .",
    "8 shows the effect of the off - diagonal imaginary couplings on the total fusion of @xmath3li+@xmath1co .",
    "this is the only system ( the lightest one studied ) for which we have obtained stable results when all imaginary couplings are included , as the off - diagonal imaginary couplings are not too strong in this case . in fig .",
    "8 , we also compare the total fusion excitation function obtained with the present approach ( using two optical potentials ) to that obtained with our previous method in ref .",
    "@xcite ( using one imaginary potential defined in the c.m .",
    "coordinate of @xmath3li ) .",
    "the cross sections neglecting the off - diagonal imaginary couplings ( full squares in fig .",
    "8) are the same as shown with full dots in fig .",
    "the cross sections including all imaginary couplings are presented with full stars .",
    "the off - diagonal imaginary couplings slightly reduce the total fusion cross sections ( by @xmath43 around the barrier and by @xmath44 well above the barrier ) .",
    "however , the cross sections obtained with the present approach ( full squares ) differ considerably from those ( full triangles ) calculated with the method from ref .",
    "@xcite , as expected for the @xmath3li projectile ( see introduction ) .",
    "the results indicate that there are many events where one of the fragments of @xmath3li is captured , but the c.m . of the projectile",
    "does not reach the absorption ( fusion ) region .",
    "the imaginary potential used in the method from ref .",
    "@xcite has the same shape and magnitude as the imaginary part of the optical potentials in the present approach .",
    "li+@xmath1co using different approaches .",
    "the calculated values are connected with curves to guide the eye .",
    "the arrow indicates the value of the coulomb barrier .",
    "see text for further details.,width=327 ]    li+@xmath1co using two different approaches , namely full coupled channels calculations ( crc ) and the barrier penetration model ( bpm ) .",
    "the calculated values are connected with curves to guide the eye .",
    "see text for further details.,width=327 ]    in fig 9 , we compare the total fusion excitation function ( open circles ) obtained with the barrier penetration model ( bpm ) @xcite to that obtained with full coupled channels calculations when all imaginary couplings are included ( full stars in fig .",
    "the total fusion excitation functions are normalized with the cross sections in absence of couplings to breakup channels .",
    "the bpm model assumes that all the flux that penetrates a single barrier ( defined for these calculations as the sum of the bare potential and the real part of a local dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) @xcite ) leads to fusion .",
    "the dpp potential includes the effect of couplings to breakup channels and was extracted from the cdcc calculation shown with full stars in fig .",
    "this approach to fusion has been extensively used in the last few years @xcite to predict total fusion cross sections with weakly bound projectiles , e.g. very recently for @xmath3li and @xmath3he on the @xmath14pb target @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the bpm cross sections ( open circles ) underestimate ( by @xmath45 just around the barrier and by @xmath46 well above the barrier ) the actual cross sections ( full stars ) , which is particularly relevant at energies just around the barrier .",
    "this is because the bpm approach does not include fusion within the projectile - target barrier @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the full coupled channel calculations ( full stars ) , the bpm approach ( open circles ) shows total fusion suppression for the whole range of incident energies studied ( by @xmath47 just around the barrier and by @xmath48 well above the barrier ) .",
    "the present results shows that the bpm approach is particularly inappropriate at energies just around the barrier and also yields a rather inaccurate answer to the question how breakup affects total fusion .    with the above comparisons , it is important to note that to realistically predict total fusion cross sections the fusion model should be carefully chosen depending on the cluster structure of the weakly bound projectile and on what the experiment is expected to measure ( in order to ensure a realistic comparison of theoretical and experimental data ) .",
    "total ( complete + incomplete ) fusion excitation functions of @xmath0li on @xmath1co and @xmath2bi targets at coulomb barrier energies are obtained using full coupled channels calculations with a new cdcc method of calculating fusion , that has short - range fusion potentials for each fragment separately .",
    "the realistic prediction of total fusion cross sections requires the selection of an appropriate fusion model which depends on both the cluster structure of the weakly bound projectile and what the experiment is supposed to measure .",
    "the effect of breakup on fusion can be observed in the total fusion excitation function .",
    "the breakup enhances the total fusion of @xmath0li at energies just around the barrier , whereas it has very little effect on total fusion at energies well above the barrier .",
    "the fusion enhancement factor strongly depends on the decreasing incident energy below the barrier .",
    "the fusion enhancement is larger for the reaction with @xmath3li than that with @xmath6li , and it is correlated with the smaller @xmath34-breakup threshold of @xmath3li .",
    "the difference between the bound - state structures of @xmath0li does not produce large difference between their total fusion excitation functions .",
