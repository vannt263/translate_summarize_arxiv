    "in this paper we wish to establish the dynamics of a model which describes a pair of spin-1/2 systems ( ie .",
    ", 2-level systems ) , which are coupled both to each other and to an environmental sea of oscillators .",
    "our hamiltonian thus has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are 2 pauli spins and the @xmath3 , with @xmath4 , are the oscillator coordinates .",
    "this model is interesting for many reasons , and we begin by listing some of them :    \\(i ) we shall see that the dynamics of @xmath1 and @xmath2 can actually be solved ( once we have integrated out the environment )",
    ". such solvable models of quantum dissipative systems are rare .",
    "previous examples include the `` spin - boson '' model @xcite where a single 2-level system couples to an oscillator bath , the `` central spin model '' @xcite ( where a 2-level system couples to a bath of spins ) , quantum brownian motion @xcite and the damped oscillator @xcite ( where a single oscillator couples to an oscillator bath ) .",
    "only the last two of these have a classical analogue . in both classical and quantum physics ,",
    "an enormous amount about the physics of relaxation and decay has been learnt from such models for the study of decoherence .",
    "however , significantly absent from these studies is the generalisation to two coupled quantum systems . in classical physics",
    "such a generalisation introduces resonant coupling , `` beats '' , and correlates the relaxation .",
    "we shall see here that the quantum generalisation has all this , as well as quantum interference between the 2 systems .",
    "such phenomena are of course well - known in the context of many examples , but the advantage of eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) is that it allows us to understand how things work when the 2 systems are strongly coupled ( either to each other or to their environment ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the model eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) is particularly interesting when one or both spins describe the low - energy dynamics of a macroscopic system .",
    "in other papers under preparation @xcite , we have applied the results gained herein to understand the tunneling dynamics of coupled josephson junctions in a squid @xcite and coupled nanomagnets .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental way in which eq . ( [ htotal ] )",
    "can be applied is to discuss the quantum measurement process @xcite .",
    "we are aware of no previous work which attempts to discuss both a measured system and the measuring apparatus on an entirely quantum level , whilst both are coupled to their environment .",
    "previous studies ( in particular those by leggett et al .",
    "@xcite ) deal exclusively with one or the other of these systems . in this paper",
    "we will already see some startling results relevant to this problem ; we will devote an entire future paper to them @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) models of the type eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) are used widely throughout physics , particularly in condensed matter physics .",
    "some disparate examples should suffice to illustrate this .",
    "a set of 2 coupled anderson ( or kondo ) impurities are described by eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) @xcite , with the oscillators representing low - energy conduction electron excitations . a pair of tunneling defects coupled to phonons or electrons @xcite , or a pair of chromophores in a large molecule , coupled to phonons or polaritons @xcite , is almost trivially described by ( [ htotal ] ) , as are nuclear spins in a metal @xcite .",
    "the problem of coupled 2-level systems is also crucial to the understanding of many glasses @xcite . on a more macroscopic level ,",
    "we have already mentioned coupled squid s , nanomagnets , and the measurement problem . on a more microscopic level , ( [ htotal ] )",
    "is an obvious generalisation of wilson s nucleus - meson @xcite model to 2 nucleons .",
    "all these examples except for the nuclear spins involve strong coupling to the environment .",
    "there are of course many examples where this coupling is weak",
    "( perhaps the best known is that of a pair of 2-level atoms , coupled to the em field ) .",
    "such weak - coupling examples are well understood , and do not require the methods used below for their solution .    in this paper",
    ", we shall be concerned principally with the application of eq .",
    "( [ htotal ] ) to macroscopic systems at low temperature .",
    "this will lead us to study a special case of ( [ htotal ] ) , in which @xmath5 , where @xmath6 @xmath7 where the n oscillator bath modes @xmath8 are assumed for simplicity ( but without real loss of generality ) to be momentum eigenstates . the pauli matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the 2 different spins .",
    "the two spins are coupled through a direct interaction term @xmath11 giving ferro- or antiferromagnetic correlations , depending on whether @xmath11 is negative or positive . in the absence of the coupling to the environmental sea , the spins have their levels split by `` tunneling '' matrix elements @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we work in the basis in which @xmath14 and @xmath15 , eigenstates of @xmath16 , are degenerate until split by the off - diagonal tunneling .",
    "henceforth we will refer to hamiltonians like ( 1.1 ) as @xmath17 , where `` pisces '' is an abbreviation for `` pair of interacting spins coupled to an environmental sea '' .",
    "they are an obvious generalisation of the well - known spin - boson hamiltonian , which has the form @xmath18 whose dynamics was discussed in detail be leggett et al @xcite .",
    "the task of the present paper is to solve for the the 2-spin _ reduced _ density matrix @xmath19 , produced by integrating out the bath oscillators ; this describes the dynamics of the 2 spins .",
    "we emphasize here that such a study is an essential preliminary to any attempt to understand the dynamics of any of the strongly - coupled physical systems listed above ; we devote the whole of the present paper to elucidating this dynamics .",
    "although the application of these results is reserved mostly to later papers , we will comment on this herein , where possible .",
    "we may ( very briefly ) summarize our results by remarking that there are essentially three regimes of interest for the pisces model , depending on how strong is the coupling of each spin to the bath , and also how high is the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "these are    \\(i ) the `` strong coupling '' regime , where the 2 spins are sufficiently correlated so they lock together , and essentially behave as a single spin , with a quite different tunneling matrix element and a different coupling to the bath .",
    "\\(ii ) the `` correlated relaxation '' regime , where the 2 spins tunnel incoherently , but nevertheless their motion is correlated .",
    "\\(iii ) the `` mutual coherence '' regime , where the motion of one or both spins still shows ( damped ) oscillations , which are partially correlated .",
    "there is also a @xmath21 solvable regime which we have ignored - this is the perturbative regime , where the 2 spins are so weakly coupled to the bath and to each other that their dynamics can be understood by perturbation expansion in the interaction .",
    "what we have done in the present paper is to calculate the 2-spin density matrix in _",
    "analytic _ form in the above 3 regimes .",
    "we have concentrated on the case where the spins are coupled `` ohmically '' to the bath , since this is usually the physically interesting case . in this ohmic case ,",
    "the results can be presented in the form of a `` phase diagram '' ; see section v.    * organisation of the paper :* in section ii we discuss in more detail the physical origin of the pisces model , in particular for the case where the 2 spins describe the low - energy dynamics of 2 macroscopic systems . in section iii",
    "we discuss a simple `` toy '' model , where 2 spins couple by a direct interaction @xmath22 only .",
    "this model demonstrates correlations between the 2 spins in the absence of any dissipative environment ; it also makes clear the physical meaning of the various density matrix elements . in section",
    "iv we set up the formal solution for @xmath23 for the full pisces model , using influence functional methods .",
    "section v is the most important in the paper ; therein we give the detailed analytic results for @xmath23 in the various regimes described above , and discuss their physical significance .",
    "we summarise our results in section vi .",
    "the more complicated details of the calculations are relegated to a series of appendices .",
    "those readers whose primary interest is the results for the pisces dynamics should go directly to section v , which can mostly be read independently of the rest of the paper .",
    "in this section we summarize the model , and sketch the way in which the truncated pisces hamiltonian can arise from a more microscopic model .",
    "no attempt is made at a detailed derivation , since this would require that we specify a particular physical system - only the basic ideas are outlined .      to see how a pisces hamiltonian can arise , we start with a very simple model , with a total lagrangian given by @xmath24 @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27   \\label{pintlagrangian}\\ ] ]    where it is assumed that @xmath28 and @xmath29 each describe 1-dimensional 2-well potentials , which are each symmetric under the interchange @xmath30 , with minima at @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "note that in ( [ pintlagrangian ] ) , the effective couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in general complex and out of phase with each other .",
    "thus , for example , if the two systems in @xmath35 in ( [ pbarelagrangian ] ) represent two systems at different positions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , a commonly used form for the @xmath38 will be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a wave vector and @xmath41 .",
    "the form we have chosen for the coupling between the environmental modes @xmath42 and the coordinates @xmath43 is linear in both , as in the usual feynman - vernon / caldeira - leggett @xcite scheme- we discuss the validity and generality of this choice below .    included in ( [ pintlagrangian ] ) are two separate counterterms for each potential , quadratic in @xmath43 .",
    "the purpose is , as usual , to restore the bare potential @xmath44 , after renormalisation by the coupling to the environmental bosons , to its original value so that we may treat it as the physical potential . in eq .",
    "( [ blagrangian ] ) , we have not yet truncated the problem to a `` pisces '' problem , so that no direct interaction terms appear .",
    "this is why the counterterm involves 2 separate contributions .",
    "if in ( [ pbarelagrangian ] ) there had been a term @xmath45 involving @xmath46 and @xmath47 together in a direct interaction , then the counterterm would no longer be separable either .",
    "thus , in the form ( [ pbarelagrangian ] ) the pisces model only involves indirect interaction between system 1 and system 2 , mediated by the oscillator bath .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ tlagrangian ] ) is a simple generalization of the single 2-well model studied by leggett et al .",
    "@xcite , which they truncated to the spin - boson model .",
    "the manoeuvres required for the truncation of ( [ tlagrangian ] ) are the same ; we require simply that the separations @xmath48 and @xmath49 , of the 2 lowest levels in wells 1 and 2 respectively , from the higher levels in these wells , be much greater than any energy scale ( such as @xmath20 ) that we are interested in .",
    "if we impose an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath50 on the bath modes , such that @xmath51 , then we may truncate ( [ tlagrangian ] ) to the form @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    this is just the pisces model of eq .",
    "( [ hpisces ] ) and ( [ hintpisces ] ) ( in ( [ hpisces ] ) and ( [ hintpisces ] ) , the factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 are absorbed into the couplings @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the splittings @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be calculated from @xmath60 using wkb - instanton methods .",
    "although this procedure is quite complicated and technically interesting for a spin - boson problem in which the wells are not all degenerate , we will not discuss it here .",
    "we will simply assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given quantities , in the spirit of the low - energy effective hamiltonian , and that they are , as usual , exponentially small compared to the energy scale of @xmath61 in ( [ pbarelagrangian ] ) ( ie .",
    ", exponentially smaller than @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively ) .",
    "@xmath62 as written in ( [ hpisces ] ) is clearly not the most general model of this kind .",
    "a much wider range of direct couplings is possible ; instead of @xmath63 we could use @xmath64 we could also use more complicated indirect couplings ( ie .",
    ", couplings to the bath ) like @xmath65 , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the present paper we will stick to the diagonal coupling in ( [ hintpisces ] ) and keep only the direct coupling in @xmath68 .",
    "our reasoning is as follows .",
    "just as for the single spin - boson problem , we expect diagonal couplings to dominate the low - energy dynamics of the combined system , since the spins spend almost all their time in a diagonal state ( only a fraction @xmath69 of their time is in a non - diagonal state , when the relevant system is tunneling under the barrier ) . in certain cases",
    "the diagonal couplings can be zero ( usually for symmetry reasons ) , and then one must include non - diagonal couplings like @xmath70 .",
    "here we deal only with the generic case of dominant diagonal couplings ; we shall see in any case that the physics generated by ( [ hintpisces ] ) is complicated enough as it is .",
    "our reason for keeping the longitudinal direct coupling in ( [ direct ] ) is connected to our choice of diagonal couplings between the bath and the systems .",
    "the interaction in ( [ hintpisces ] ) will couple @xmath71 and @xmath72 to produce a longitudinal direct coupling of the form @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , one may quite generally observe that in a field - theoretical context , any direct interaction can be viewed as the result of a coupling between @xmath74 and @xmath75 through the high - frequency or `` fast '' modes of some dynamic field ; `` fast '' in this context simply means much faster than the low - energy scales of interest , so that the interaction may be treated as quasi - instantaneous . in our case , integrating out these fast modes , those with a frequency greater than @xmath76 then produces the longitudinal static interaction in ( [ hpisces ] ) .",
    "one further omission from ( [ hpisces ] ) is an applied bias acting on one or both of the spins , of the form @xmath77 , for example .",
    "this important extra ingredient will be discussed elsewhere @xcite- our present interest is in the dynamic interaction between the spins , generated through the bath , and most of the present paper is devoted to unravelling its effects .",
    "the `` high - energy '' lagrangian of ( [ tlagrangian ] ) to ( [ pintlagrangian ] ) already uses an oscillator bath representation of the environment , ie .",
    ", it already involves a low - energy truncation of some more detailed microscopic representation of the environment .",
    "we briefly recall the arguments that justify this representation @xcite , and when they fail .",
    "one begins by assuming a large number @xmath78 of degrees of freedom in the environment , with couplings @xmath79 between the environmental excitations @xmath80 and @xmath81 of order @xmath82 .",
    "one also assumes that the coupling @xmath83 of @xmath81 to an external `` system '' obeys @xmath84 . in the pisces model , as well as the spin - boson model ,",
    "the @xmath83 are just the @xmath85 .",
    "there are of course many canonical examples of such environments , such as @xmath86 ( normal , superfluid , solid , or quantum gas ) , @xmath87 superfluid and solid , metals , semiconductors , magnets , superconductors , simple insulators , etc .",
    "notice that any _ delocalised _ degrees of freedom will _ formally _ satisfy these requirements , simply because their wave - functions will be normalised inside a box of size @xmath88 .",
    "if we treat the couplings @xmath83 perturbatively , up to @xmath89-order , it is always possible to represent the environment as a bath of oscillators ( c.f . ,",
    "feynman and vernon @xcite , pp .",
    "153 - 159 ) .",
    "we are then bound to end up with an effective lagrangian of form @xmath90 where @xmath91 takes the form ( [ blagrangian ] ) , @xmath92 is the lagrangian of the system and @xmath93 ( or some form related to this by a canonical transformation @xcite ) .",
    "it is often assumed that the excursions of the system are small , and then @xmath94 is written as @xmath95 , as in the pisces and spin - boson problems . however in many practical situations one obviously has to go to more general couplings ( eg . , the coupling @xmath96 ) , arising from a potential probe @xmath97 ; here @xmath98 is an environmental boson operator , which could equally describe fermion particle - hole pairs via @xmath99 ) , and one is led to ( [ feynvern ] ) .",
    "thus the question of the validity of the oscillator bath representation of the environment boils down to the applicability of the 2nd - order perturbative treatment of the @xmath100 .",
    "it is important to understand that even if there appears to be some breakdown of the perturbative expansion , it may easily be curable by a suitable canonical transformation . consider , eg .",
    ", the luttinger liquid with back scattering ; although the @xmath101 are formally @xmath102 , they are infrared divergent ( in caldeira - leggett language , they are subohmic ) .",
    "nevertheless , a canonical transformation to a quite new set of environmental modes @xcite reveals that this subohmic form is an artefact of the original bosonisation- the coupling to the new modes is a conventional ohmic one .",
    "another salutary example is provided by the coupling of solitons to their environment .",
    "however , an environment which _ can not _ in general be mapped to an oscillator bath is an environment of uncoupled ( or very weakly coupled ) spins , or 2-level systems . in this case one",
    "finds that the couplings of the n individual spins @xmath103 to the central quantum system are not @xmath102 , but independent of @xmath78 . in some cases they are also very strong ,",
    "so that instead of the environmental dynamics being only weakly affected by the quantum system of interest , they are in fact slaved to it @xcite .    from this very brief discussion ( for a",
    "much more lengthy one see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we see that provided we can ignore the effects of some `` spin bath '' environment ( eg . , nuclear or paramagnetic spins , or local defects of some kind ) , the oscillator bath description should be a good representation of the low - energy environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "before dealing with the full pisces model , we summarize the results for the dynamics of a much simpler problem , in which the 2 spins couple to each other by a static longitudinal interaction @xmath104 , and no environment is present . in a certain sense the pisces model can be viewed as a dissipative version of this `` toy model '' .",
    "first recall that a single spin in a bias field @xmath105 , with hamiltonian @xmath106 and with eigenvalues @xmath107 and eigenfunctions @xmath108 \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath109^{1/2}\\ ] ] has a `` 1-spin '' density matrix @xmath110 in which the wave - function @xmath111 of the system , at time @xmath112 , is expanded as @xmath113 , with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "assuming an initial state @xmath116 , @xmath117 then evolves as @xmath118 in the equivalent 2-well problem , the initial `` wave - packet '' @xmath119 partially oscillates between the 2 wells- the diagonal elements give the occupation probability of the wells , and the off - diagonal elements describe oscillatory quantum interference between them , which is suppressed by the bias ; when @xmath120 , the particle stays in one well , in the absence of any coupling to the environment .",
    "now consider 2 coupled spins , with a hamiltonian containing a simple longitudinal interaction : @xmath121 the coupling creates a `` dynamical bias '' whereby each spin tends to force the other spin into one or other of its wells .",
    "the 2-spin density matrix takes the form @xmath122 ( c.f .",
    ", eq ( [ 2wdenformal])),in which we order the states as @xmath123 ; the amplitudes @xmath124 are given by @xmath125 + ij_{0 } [ \\frac{1}{\\omega_{+ } } \\sin \\omega_{+ } t +   \\frac{1}{\\omega_{- } } \\sin \\omega_{- } t ] \\right)\\ ] ] @xmath126 @xmath127",

    "when @xmath133 , the 2 spins oscillate independently , with product wave function @xmath141 , and @xmath117 has oscillation components corresponding to the sum and difference frequencies @xmath142 ( see ( [ ampjzero ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath143 is finite , we still have sum and difference frequencies @xmath131 in @xmath117 , but the behaviour is more complicated because the wave - function is no longer a product wave - function - the coupling `` entangles '' the 2 spins .",
    "in fact the eigenfunctions are now @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 with energies @xmath148 @xmath149 and the way in which the entanglement occurs depends on the magnitude of @xmath143 and its sign . for @xmath150",
    "we have ( fm ) ferromagnetic coupling ; when @xmath151 , the ground state @xmath152 tends toward the superposition @xmath153 .",
    "for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling , the states @xmath154 and @xmath155 are emphasized and for @xmath156 , the ground state , which is now @xmath157 tends to the superposition @xmath158 .",
    "consider now the probability @xmath159 , for a system to start in @xmath140 at @xmath129 , and finish at time @xmath112 in state @xmath160 . in figs.([probjl ] ) and ( [ probjs ] ) we plot these probabilities for both strong - coupling ( @xmath161 ) and weak - coupling ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "consider first the strong - coupling regime .",
    "for both fm and afm coupling , if the initial state is @xmath140 , we see that the system essentially oscillates between @xmath140 and @xmath163 states with an effective frequency @xmath164 .",
    "the oscillations between @xmath165 and @xmath166 are very fast , frequency @xmath167 , but their amplitude is reduced by a factor @xmath168 .",
    "notice the afm system can not relax to some combination of the lower - energy states @xmath169 and @xmath155 ( there is no environment ) , a problem which does not arise ( for this initial state ) in the fm case , where the initial state @xmath140 is already a superposition of the 2 low - lying eigenstates @xmath170 and @xmath171 in ( [ 2cspineigenf ] ) .",
    "this situation is precisely analogous to the strongly biased 2-well system , where an initial state @xmath116 in the biased system is stuck at high energy . in the same way ,",
    "there is little coherence between the ( @xmath140 , @xmath172 ) manifold and the ( @xmath154 , @xmath155 ) manifold when @xmath173 is large , i.e. , @xmath143 suppresses both coherence between singlet and triplet states , and the off - diagonal elements in @xmath117 .    in the opposite limit of weak coupling the density",

    "in this section we set up a formal expression for the 2-spin density matrix for the pisces system .",
    "this is done by first integrating out the oscillator bath modes to produce an expression in terms of an influence functional ; then we show how the resulting expression can be summed over instanton paths .",
    "some of the derivation is an obvious generalization of the work from leggett et al .",

    "the results can be summarised as follows .",
    "the single spin functionals @xmath268 are those derived by leggett et al .",
    "@xcite ; they can often be treated in the `` dilute blip approximation '' , in which only the `` blip self - energy '' terms ( ie . , between 2 times in the same blip ) , and interaction between a blip and the sojourn immediately preceding it are included .",
    "this works , provided the interactions with the bath are sufficiently strong that blips are rare ; essentially it assumes that the environmental decoherence is strong enough to severely suppress the `` off - diagonal '' paths in the density matrix , in which the damping term @xmath302 in eq .",
    "( 4.23 ) comes in .",
    "consequently , during the waiting time between two such off - diagonal excursions or `` blips '' , the system completely `` forgets '' the effects of the previous blip .",
    "the dilute blip approximation is much more problematic when an interaction term in the hamiltonian is trying to force the density matrix into off - diagonal states .",
    "this point is rather crucial when we come to the interaction functional @xmath261 , since the main effect of the bath turns out to be the introduction of an extra interaction @xmath303 between the 2 spins , with @xmath304 given by @xmath305 for ohmic dissipation , the explicit form of @xmath304 is @xmath306 where @xmath307 . for superohmic dissipation",
    ", we get @xmath308 in the subohmic case , @xmath309 so that the integral diverges and the model becomes ill - defined .",
    "it is important to notice that the magnitude of this bias depends on the upper cut - off frequency of the bath - this is simply because the total strength of the interaction involves the high - energy ( adiabatic ) modes .",
    "now , this _ bath - induced _ interaction simply adds to the original high frequency `` direct '' interaction to give the total adiabatic interaction between the two spins as @xmath310 the big problem for the theory is now that @xmath311 plays the role of a `` mutual bias '' between the 2 spins , just as @xmath143 did in our toy model of section iii ; it turns out that most of its effects come from interactions between blips of one system and sojourns of the other . unless both systems are overdamped ( or both locked together , so that blips on one can not overlap with sojourns of the other ) ,",
    "then it is clear that we can not introduce any kind of dilute blip approximation on a single system , independently of the other , to handle the interspin term @xmath261 .",
    "nevertheless we will show , in the next section ( and in appendices c and d ) how it is possible to evaluate @xmath261 by generalising this approximation .",
    "we now turn to the detailed behaviour of the density matrix .",
    "in this section , we obtain the dynamics of the 2-spin reduced density matrix . we explicitly calculate the 4 diagonal matrix elements @xmath312 , which are the probabilities for the system to end up in a state @xmath313 after a time @xmath112 , having started in a state @xmath314 .",
    "we will concentrate in what follows on the most interesting ohmic case , where the 2 spins are coupled ohmically to the sea of oscillators . since it is conventional to express the strength of this ohmic coupling by a dimensionless constant @xmath276 , we will henceforth use the index @xmath315 to label the 2-spins ( we do not use @xmath316 in what follows ) .",
    "we will use temperature and frequency units in which @xmath317 , so that the thermal energy @xmath20 and the tunneling splitting energies are @xmath318 .    for this ohmic pisces problem",
    ", we will concentrate on those parameter regimes in which analytic results can be obtained for @xmath319 . having achieved these , it is possible to build up a fairly complete picture of the behaviour of @xmath319 .",
    ", in all temperature and coupling range of interest . we can identify 4 regimes in the dynamics , as shown in the `` phase diagram '' of fig .",
    "( [ pphase ] ) .",
    "these 4 regimes are , in the ohmic case , defined as follows :    \\(i ) the `` locked phase '' ( @xmath320 ) : in this regime , the effective coupling @xmath321 is so strong that the 2 spins lock together , in either the states @xmath322 or @xmath166 depending on the sign of @xmath321 .",
    "this state is very similar to the strongly - coupled state described in section 3 ; we shall see that the combined `` locked spin '' oscillates between @xmath314 and @xmath323 ( for fm coupling ) , or between @xmath324 and @xmath166 ( for afm coupling ) , at a renormalised frequency @xmath325 .",
    "however these oscillations are damped - in fact the locked spin now behaves like a single spin - boson system , with a new coupling @xmath326 to the oscillator bath , the @xmath327 ( @xmath328 ) corresponding to ferromagnetic ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling between the spins .",
    "\\(ii ) the `` mutual coherence '' phase ( @xmath329 ; @xmath330 ) : here , the thermal energy overcomes the mutual coupling ; nevertheless if the dissipative couplings @xmath331 s are sufficiently small ( @xmath332 ) , it is possible for the energy scale @xmath333 to dominate even if @xmath334 . in this case , even though we are dealing with a strong coupling , and the bath dissipation is still important , some coherence in the motion of each spin is maintained - moreover , the small @xmath321 causes `` mutual coherence '' between the two spins , ie . , their damped oscillations are correlated to some extent .",
    "\\(iii ) the `` correlated relaxation '' or high - t phase ( @xmath335 ) . in this regime , the bath causes each spin to relax incoherently ; however , the relaxation of the two spins is still correlated ( indeed each spin relaxes in the time - dependent bias generated by the other ) .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , and much less interesting , the `` perturbative regime '' ( @xmath336 ) , in which the total coupling is so weak that the 2 spins relax almost independently ; all correlations can be handled perturbatively , and only weakly affect the behaviour that one calculates from the standard spin - boson model .",
    "we notice that the locked and correlated relaxation phases always exist ; but the mutual coherence phase is much more delicate , and only appears if the coupling of each spin to the bath is weak ( ie . , @xmath332 ) .",
    "to get a better intuitive feeling for the energy scales and the different regimes , it is useful to imagine how the behaviour of the pisces system changes as one moves along various paths in the phase diagram .",
    "imagine first that we start off in the lower right half of fig .",
    "( [ pphase ] ) , at a very low @xmath20 ( much less than any other energy ) .",
    "then temperature fluctuations are irrelevent , even if each spin is strongly coupled to the bath ; the effect of the induced interaction @xmath321 is simply to lock the 2 spins into one .",
    "this `` spin complex '' also couples to the bath , but now with a quite different coupling ; and it can also tunnel between 2 orientations , but at a much lower frequency .",
    "typically its motion at finite @xmath20 will be completely overdamped , and it will localize as @xmath20 tends to zero .",
    "however if we now raise @xmath20 , the thermal fluctuations increase in importance , and eventually compete with @xmath321 ; the spins start to unlock from each other .",
    "this crossover regime can not be handled analytically , but further increase in @xmath20 causes complete unlocking- we enter the correlated relaxation phase , where the thermal fluctuations are strong enough to destroy any coherent dynamics of the system , but the relaxtion of each is still correlated with that of the other . if @xmath337 , even these correlations become irrelevant- the 2 spins relax independently .",
    "one may make a similar traversal , this time from correlated to locked phase , this time by starting at high @xmath20 but weak coupling ( top left in the figure ) , and then increasing the coupling .",
    "much more interesting is to go to low @xmath20 and then increase the coupling .",
    "two situations are then possible .",
    "one is where the coupling @xmath276 to the bath is not small .",
    "then there is no mutual coherence regime , and we find ourselves initially in the lower right quadrant of the figure . even with large @xmath276 , one may still envisage a very small @xmath321 ( eg .",
    ", if the 2 spins are very far apart ) . then each behaves independently ( with weak perurbative interactive corrections ) , as a spin - boson system . increasing the coupling ( ie .",
    ", increasing their distance apart ) increases the correlations , until they eventually lock ; the crossover can not be handled analytically .",
    "on the other hand if @xmath338 , so each spin is weakly coupled to the bath , one can get a situation in which their mutual coupling , although weak , still exceeds the renormalised tunneling splitting @xmath339 . in this case",
    "the @xmath20-fluctuations are not strong enough to upset their mutual correlations , or to destroy coherent behaviour on the part of each spin , even if @xmath340 , provided @xmath341 .",
    "the spin is simply so weakly coupled to the bath that it hardly sees the @xmath20- fluctuations , but @xmath321 causes the oscillations of the 2 spins to correlate- we get `` damped beats '' .",
    "further increase in @xmath20 decoheres these completely , and further increase in @xmath321 locks the 2 spins together .",
    "this mutual coherence phase is clearly going to be favoured if we have 2 spins close to each other ( to make @xmath321 big enough ) , yet very weakly coupled to the bath .",
    "the difficulty of setting up a pisces model which allows a mutual coherence phase is connected with the following important general feature of the results . in the problem of",
    "a _ single _ spin coupled to an oscillator bath , it is known that one may always get some coherent behaviour provided @xmath20 is low enough , and also @xmath342 .",
    "however in the present case of 2 spins , coherent behaviour is much harder to find ; even if @xmath276 is very small , coherence is destroyed if we `` switch on '' the coupling between the 2 spins , once @xmath321 reaches the very small energy scale @xmath343 .",
    "this is because the `` dynamic bias '' on one spin , coming from the other , removes the `` resonance condition '' between initial and final states which is necessary for coherent oscillations .",
    "it shows , in essence , that mutual interactions _ increase decoherence effects_. this enhanced decoherence is particularly interesting in the context of the measurement operation , or indeed for any attempt to look for macroscopic quantum coherence .",
    "a more formal understanding of these energy scales comes out of a renormalisation group treatment , to which we proceed first . after this",
    "the analytic results for each regime are presented .",
    "although a renormalisation group analysis can not give us the dynamics of the pisces model , it gives considerable insight into the energy scales mentioned above .",
    "we shall use the `` poor - man '' renormalisation procedure first applied to the kondo problem by anderson et al .",
    "@xcite , and then later to the single spin - boson problem @xcite .",
    "cardy @xcite devised a method to treat the multisite problem , which was then applied to the case of two anderson impurities @xcite and two tunneling impurities in metal @xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix b , in the case where both spins are identical ( ie . , where @xmath344 , and @xmath345 ) the partition function for this problem is identical to that considered by chakravarty and hirsch @xcite , and we carry over directly their scaling equations for a set of fugacities @xmath346 where the dimensionless fugacity @xmath347 and @xmath348 and @xmath349 are the fugacities associated with simultaneous transitions of the 2 spins . since @xmath350 , the behaviour of the fugacities is determined solely by the single spin dissipation coefficients .",
    "these coefficients are also renormalised ; their scaling is @xmath351 finally , there is also a scaling of the coupling energy @xmath352    the renormalisation group analysis assumes that the dimensionless quantities @xmath353 , @xmath354 and @xmath355 are all much less than one .",
    "the scaling has to be stopped if one of the parameters renormalises to the strong coupling regime .",
    "the three important scaling parameters are thus @xmath356 , a renormalised tunneling matrix element , @xmath357 and @xmath358 .",
    "let us first set @xmath359 .",
    "the scaling equations are then very similar to the case of the single spin - boson system . at @xmath360 , the scaling of @xmath353",
    "is determined by @xmath276 . for @xmath361",

    "the dynamics will then be determined by @xmath348 or @xmath349 .",
    "depending on the strongest of the two , only the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic states will be occupied .",

    "the symmetry between the levels is broken and eq .",
    "( [ sbreaking ] ) indicates that this difference will _ grow _ with the scaling , even if the fugacity grows as well ( since @xmath369 by assumption ) .",

    "if both @xmath371 and @xmath357 are smaller than @xmath358 , the scaling stops before the strong coupling phase is attained and the system behaves like two single spins , although coupled by the interaction @xmath321 .",
    "however , if @xmath321 is the largest energy scale , the system rapidly gets into the strong coupling phase and the rg equations break down .",
    "it is clear however that the new strongly coupled phase is made of the two spins locked together by @xmath321 .",
    "the thermal fluctuations ( controlled by @xmath20 ) and the tendency to individual dynamics ( determined by @xmath372 ) can not compensate this strong coupling .      here",
    "@xmath321 is so strong that a prohibitively high energy cost is incurred if a blip on one path overlaps with a sojourn on the other . in appendix",
    "b this is discussed in more detail , and we demonstrate that for a strongly fm - coupled system which starts in initial state @xmath314 , the resulting dynamics is is equivalent to that of a _ single _",
    "spin- boson system , with a new tunneling matrix element @xmath373 , and with this `` spin complex '' now coupled to the environment with a new ohmic coupling @xmath374 .",
    "the new oscillation frequency is not surprising- we have already seen it in our toy model in the strong coupling regime . as for the new coupling to the bath , it is simply equivalent to the coefficient @xmath375 coming from the renormalisation group analysis ( see appendix b ) .",
    "physically , in the case of fm coupling , the system oscillates between @xmath322 and @xmath323 at a frequency @xmath376 , if we ignore the environmental dissipation .",
    "mixing with the high - energy states @xmath165 and @xmath377 is negligible ( with @xmath378 , even thermally - excited transitions , via absorption of bath quanta , will be exponentially rare ) , and so the system reduces to the single spin - boson problem .",
    "a system coupled by a strong afm interaction will have the same effective tunneling matrix element @xmath379 , but will now be coupled to the environment by a dissipation coefficient @xmath380 . once again , the new coupling can be related to a the rg analysis , in this case , it is simply the coefficient @xmath381 of appendix b.    notice that the case of an afm - coupled system which begins in the state @xmath314 is quite different , since this is then a _ high _ energy state . without the bath , the system is frozen in this state ( c.f .",
