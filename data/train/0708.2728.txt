    "the existence of gravitational waves ( gw ) , has long been verified ` indirectly ' through the observations of hulse and taylor  @xcite .",
    "however , direct observation of such waves with manmade gravitational wave detectors has been lacking . at present",
    "the laser interferometric detectors have achieved sensitivities close to that required for detecting such waves  @xcite .",
    "the space mission lisa  @xcite is also planned by the esa and nasa to detect low frequency gw .",
    "the significance of the direct detection of gw lies , not only in the opening of an entirely new window into observational astronomy by probing phenomena in the regime of strong gravity ; it further promises to test our present theories of gravitation .",
    "different types of gw sources have been predicted and may be directly observed by earth - based detectors in the near future ( see  @xcite and references therein for recent reviews ) : ( i )  transient sources  such as binary systems of neutron stars ( ns ) and/or black holes ( bh ) in their in - spiral phase , bh / bh and/or bh / ns mergers , and supernovae explosions , whose signals last for a time much shorter , typically between a few milli - seconds and a few minutes , than the planned observational time ; ( ii )  continuous wave ( cw ) sources  e.g. rapidly rotating neutron stars , where a weak deterministic signal is continuously emitted , and ( iii )  stochastic backgrounds of radiation , either of primordial or astrophysical origin .    in this paper we will address the problem of a spatially resolved search of the gravitational wave stochastic background .",
    "this approach was advocated in the ligo technical note  @xcite and the basic analysis was recently implemented on the fourth science run data from the ligo interferometers to prepare an upper limit map  @xcite .",
    "our main focus will be on a stochastic astrophysical gw background ( agwb ) , which might arise from a superposition of a large number of independent and unresolved gw sources .",
    "the gravitational wave background can arise from a variety of sources : supernovae with asymmetric core collapse , binary black hole ( bbh ) mergers , gws from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and hydrodynamical instabilities in neutron stars ( r - modes ) , or even gws from astrophysical objects that we never knew existed .",
    "when a collection of any subset of these sources is unresolvable , it can appear as a stochastic gw background ( sgwb ) of a variable duration in our detectors of interest . while an astrophysical background will provide information about our immediate neighborhood , cosmological gw backgrounds ( cgwb )",
    "could probe the physics of the early universe .",
    "there exist cosmological scenarios ( e.g. , cosmic strings and super - string models ) which predict cgwb that should be detectable by advanced ligo  @xcite .",
    "we propose and develop a data analysis method that measures and maps the power in the sgwb from a specific location in the sky - gw radiometry using a network of detectors .",
    "we find that the angular resolution essentially depends on the effective gw bandwidth and the linear size of the network . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the network of the two 4 km ligo detectors at hanford ( lho ) and livingston ( llo ) .",
    "for the purposes of our analysis , we take their noise curves to be identical with the ligo - i design power spectral density  @xcite .",
    "our future plan is to include virgo and other detectors around the world in the numerical implementation of this analysis .",
    "the basic statistic is the cross - correlation between the data from a pair of detectors . in order to ` point ' the pair of detectors at different locations one must suitably delay the signal by the amount it takes for the gw to travel to both detectors corresponding to the source direction .",
    "this delay will be a function of the source position and will vary as the earth rotates . using the delay",
    "allows the detectors to sample the same wavefront from the source .",
    "the cross - spectrum formulation has been carried out in  @xcite .",
    "methods for searching for isotropic backgrounds  @xcite using the cross - correlation and for anisotropies using spherical harmonic decomposition  @xcite have been devised .",
    "efforts have also been made to devise methods to measure the spherical harmonic moments of the sgwb anisotropy using a network of ground or space based detectors  @xcite . here",
    "we focus on a spatially resolved search and the final goal is to make a map of the true sgwb sky . we achieve this goal by pixelizing the sky , that is , we use a pixel basis .",
    "the advantage of a spatially resolved search is seen immediately if we examine the so called overlap reduction factor , which partially determines the fractional power of source spectrum the search filter will receive at different frequency bands .",
    "the overlap reduction factor , normally denoted by @xmath0 in the literature  @xcite for the isotropic unpolarized background , becomes a time - dependent factor @xmath1 for the spatially resolved search .",
    "for the ligo detectors , @xmath0 quickly reduces to zero beyond few tens of hz , while @xmath1 has infinite bandwidth .",
    "so the bandwidth of the spatially resolved search is essentially detector bandwidth limited .",
    "this is typically valid for a network of detectors and therefore important from the point of view of the sensitivity regime of gw detectors which lies in this region .    as in radio - interferometry ,",
    "the correlation statistic so constructed produces a ` dirty ' map where a point source does not produce a point image , but one that is smeared by a beam response function ( beam , for brevity ) .",
    "the ` cleaned ' gw sky map is obtained from the measured cross - correlation statistic by deconvolving the beam .",
    "in other words , to obtain the gw power from each direction in the sky one needs to solve an integral equation where the measured power ( data ) is a convolution of the actual power with a kernel ( beam ) . in order to understand the structure of the beam we carry out a numerical and an analytical study using the stationary phase approximation ( spa ) . we find that at low declinations ( latitudes ) of a point source , the kernel essentially has the shape of a figure ` 8 ' with a bright spot at the intersection .",
    "the bright spot is at the location of the point source .",
    "the figure of ` 8 ' continuously changes and bifurcates into a ` tear drop ' as the point source moves to higher declinations .",
    "the declination at which this bifurcation occurs is determined by the half - angle of the cone traced out by the vector joining the two detectors . for the ligo detectors",
    "this declination is about @xmath2 .",
    "the size of the bright spot or effective sky patch , defined by a certain percentage of reduction in the beam response function , say @xmath3 , is determined by the inverse of the band - width divided by the light ( gw ) travel time between the detectors . considering a broadband source and ligo detectors having khz bandwidth with 10 ms light travel distance between them ,",
    "the angular size is about @xmath4 in radius .",
    "we find that these results agree very well with those obtained by applying singular value decomposition to the kernel matrix ; the eigenvalues fall off steeply after a certain point which determines essentially the number of ` degrees of freedom ' of the kernel matrix and thereby the size of the sky patch .",
    "we employ the maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach for deconvolving the sky map .",
    "the integral equation for a discrete pixelised sky leads to a set of linear algebraic equations .",
    "several deconvolution algorithms exist in literature for solving such a problem .",
    "however , because of the broad similarity of our present problem with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) analysis , we have opted for techniques that have been successfully applied to deconvolve cmb sky maps .",
    "moreover , the ml approach provides a framework to study the sgwb anisotropy in other basis of interest , e.g. , the spherical harmonic basis .",
    "we find the ml estimate by employing the conjugate gradient method . to verify our method",
    ", we apply the analysis on simulated sky maps mapped by a gw radiometer consisting of ligo pair of detectors lho and llo .",
    "we generate ` realistic ' colored gaussian noise corresponding to ligo - i design sensitivity curve  @xcite detector noise and embed various simulated sky maps of the gw stochastic background into the noise .",
    "we demonstrate that the true sky maps can be recovered satisfactorily .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ gwrd ] we briefly review the gw radiometer concepts and obtain an expression for the gw radiometric cross - correlation signal , which is then optimized for the maximum signal - to - noise ( snr ) . in section  [ sec : conveq ] , we set up the integral equation that must be solved in order to obtain the true sky map from the data .",
    "a time - frequency analysis is performed and the directed optimal filter is derived for anisotropic searches . moreover , a stationary phase analysis is presented which provides us with the understanding of the kernel or the point spread function . in section",
    "[ sec : ml ] , we describe the maximum likelihood approach and the conjugate gradient method and apply it to simulated data to test the efficacy of this method . later subsections outline the extension of the gw radiometer analysis to incorporate multiple baselines obtained with a network of detectors and the extension of the gw radiometer to search for polarized sgwb .",
    "the numerical implementation of the method is described in section  [ sec : numres ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ remarks ] .",
    "radiometry or aperture synthesis is a well known technique in radio astronomy and cmb experiments .",
    "the idea is to _ point _ a pair of detectors separated by a baseline to a desired direction in the sky by introducing an appropriate time - delay between their data - streams .",
    "this delay corresponds to the difference between the times of arrival of a gw signal if it were to arrive at those two detector sites from that direction . for a given source in the sky , this delay will change as the baseline orientation changes due to the rotation of the earth .",
    "the cross - correlation of the data from the two detectors , appropriately time - delayed , would cause potential gw signals arriving from the chosen direction to interfere constructively . whereas signals from other directions will tend to cancel out because of destructive interference .",
    "this principle of earth rotation aperture synthesis , which is well - known in radio astronomy , could very well be used in gw astronomy using pairs of gw antennae .",
    "figure [ radiometer ] illustrates the principle on which the gw radiometer works .",
    "is the separation or baseline vector between the two detectors ; as the earth rotates , its direction changes , but its magnitude remains fixed .",
    "the direction to the source @xmath5 is also fixed in the barycentric frame .",
    "the phase difference between signals arriving at two detector sites from the same direction is also shown.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we consider the celestial equatorial frame whose origin coincides with the centre of the earth .",
    "the axes are defined as follows : for a fixed but arbitrarily chosen time @xmath6 , the @xmath7-axis is directed towards the intersection of the equator and the longitude @xmath8 , which can be taken as the greenwich meridian ; the @xmath9-axis is directed towards the north celestial pole and the @xmath10-axis is chosen orthogonal to the previous two axes forming a right - handed triad .",
    "the earth rotates in this frame with the angular velocity @xmath11 radians / sec oriented along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the two detectors are at locations @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) , and the baseline vector joining the two sites is @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath5 is the unit vector in the direction to the source , which is fixed in the barycentric frame .",
    "the baseline @xmath15 rotates with the earth , but its magnitude @xmath16 , which is the distance between the detectors , remains constant . the map of the sgwb can be constructed by performing this synthesis for each location in the sky , patch by patch",
    ". an approximate size of the patch or resolution of the gw radiometer and number of patches required to cover the full sky can be estimated from the following simple argument .",
    "this simple model produces a fringe pattern with resolution given by the standard formula for the central width @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gw wavelength and @xmath19 is the angle of incidence .",
    "this is , however , a naive estimate .",
    "a better estimate of the resolution would follow from considerations involving the pixel - to - pixel fisher information matrix .",
    "in which case the solid angle resolution will scale inversely proportional to the square of the snr .",
    "in this paper we will consider a gw radiometer made using the two @xmath20  km ligo detectors lho and llo in the united states .",
    "however , this analysis is equally well applicable to any other baseline or a network of baselines involving other detectors such as virgo , tama , geo etc .",
    "the light travel time between the lho and llo is @xmath21 ms , which at a bandwidth of 1 khz gives a resolution @xmath22 of few degrees .",
    "this resolution implies that a few thousand patches or pixels are required to completely cover the full sky .",
    "this estimate , in turn , will be useful for assessing the computational cost and numerical complications in handling large matrices for obtaining the full skymap .",
    "we make these estimates more robust below .",
    "we first set up the notation and framework needed for investigating the problem .    in the transverse traceless ( tt )",
    "gauge the metric perturbation @xmath23 in the equatorial frame can be expanded in terms of plane waves of the two polarizations @xmath24 in the following way : @xmath25 where a tilde on a variable denotes its fourier transform ; the complex fourier amplitudes satisfy the relation @xmath26 owing to the reality of @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the polarization index and summation over the repeated index @xmath28 is implied . in terms of the spherical polar coordinates @xmath29 , the source direction is given by @xmath30 and , hence , the infinitesimal solid angle along the direction @xmath5 is @xmath31 .",
    "note that the wave propagation direction is @xmath32 .",
    "the polarization tensors @xmath33 are defined by the following expressions :    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    are the two orthonormal basis vectors on a two - sphere .",
    "the statistics of the gw signal can be best described in the fourier domain : if we assume the signal to be stochastic and uncorrelated in the two polarizations , different frequencies and different directions , then the fourier components of the gw strain obey , & & _ a^*(f , ) _",
    "a(f, ) + & & =  _ aa ( f - f ) ^2(- ) _a ( ) h(f ) ,   [ eq : indgwbmodes ] where @xmath36 is proportional to the strength of the sgwb in the direction @xmath5 and @xmath37 is the _ two sided _ gw source power spectral density ( psd ) .",
    "the interpretation of the quantity @xmath36 can be made apparent by relating it to the _ specific intensity _ or _ brightness _",
    "@xcite of gw @xmath38 .",
    "specific intensity is defined as ( @xmath39 times ) the incident energy density per unit frequency interval per unit solid angle , or , equivalently , specific intensity is the ( normally incident ) flux per unit solid angle . following the convention commonly used in sgwb analysis , if the incident gw energy density is expressed in the units of critical energy density for a flat universe",

    "in general , we can not separate @xmath37 from @xmath36 , because the frequency power spectrum @xmath37 could also depend on the direction @xmath5 .",
    "a more general treatment would use a quantity like @xmath44 which describes both frequency and angular distribution of sgwb power together .",
    "but for a small enough bandwidth the assumption may be justified , as the signal is expected to have a smooth profile of the power spectra .",
    "further , it should be noted that @xmath45 is actually a second rank tensor and should be represented by two indices as @xmath46 , but because we assume that the two polarizations are uncorrelated the quantity @xmath47 is zero and thus absent . to avoid unnecessary indices and with a slight abuse of notation",

    "the cross - correlation of the data from the two detectors is an appropriate statistic for detecting and observing stochastic gw . in order to optimize the snr ,",
    "the cross - correlation statistic for the directed search involves a direction - dependent filter function @xmath69 , which connects sidereal time @xmath70 of one detector s data to @xmath71 of the other detector s data to match the phases of the gw strains in the detectors .",
    "the filter does a inverse noise weighting using the psds of the two detectors in order to suppress noisy frequency bands and enhance the snr by assigning relatively large weight to the sensitive regimes of the detectors and the bands where the source is expected to emit more power .",
    "( in general , @xmath72 will depend on @xmath73 .",
    "for the directed search that we envisage here , as we will see later , the @xmath36 are delta functions and , therefore , the filter @xmath72 only depends on @xmath5 . )",
    "the sampling interval with which the data are sampled is determined by the nyquist frequency of the stochastic signals of interest , and can be well below a millisecond , corresponding to several kilohertz .",
    "while it is possible to compute the filter function on a time segment of this sampling interval , it is erroneous to do so for the physical problem at hand .",
    "this is because the signals at the two detectors will be incoherent on time - scales smaller than the light - travel time , @xmath74 , of that baseline , which is at most a few tens of milli - seconds for ground - based detectors .",
    "thus @xmath74 sets the lower limit on the duration of the time segment on which the filter function should be computed .",
    "the upper limit , @xmath75 , is set by the smaller of the timescales , on which the data are stationary and the timescale on which the detector orientation changes appreciably .",

    "the time segments used currently in lsc data analysis vary from @xmath78 to @xmath79 seconds , and are consistent with these limits .",
    "the final statistic for the full observation time @xmath80 is obtained by linearly combining the cross - correlations over the smaller time - intervals as a weighted sum .",

    "therefore the variance in each segment obeys @xmath113 . the signal however builds up when we integrate over all the time segments during the observation time . secondly , from eq .",
    "( [ stat ] ) , it is evident that noisy time intervals contribute less to the statistic @xmath85 leading to its optimal character .",
    "since the gw power spectra and the detector noise are modeled in the frequency domain , it is convenient to formulate the whole analysis in that domain . however , since the detector output is a time - series , it is pertinent to ask over what time - duration must one compute their fourier transforms .",
    "as discussed in the last section , typical acceptable segment sizes are a few tens to a few hundreds of seconds .",

    "the same notation will be used for several other quantities as well in this analysis .",
    "while constructing the statistic , it was assumed that the true gw strains @xmath58 in the detectors are correlated , but that the noise streams are uncorrelated .",
    "the expression for the correlation between the gw strains in two detectors will be derived here , which is necessary for the derivation of the optimal filter in the next subsection .",
    "the detector parameters can be approximated to be stationary over the period of the time segment .",
    "hence we may consider the quantities @xmath116 and @xmath117 to be nearly constant over a time segment and regard them as functions of the time @xmath53 labeling the time segment .",

    "we can extrapolate the same logic to the directed search and argue that the procedure described above to combine data from a network of detectors is also optimal .",
    "the search for a sgwb using a network of detectors is becoming progressively relevant as other kilometer scale detectors , namely virgo , geo and lcgt , are expected to reach their initial goal sensitivity in the next few years .",

    "however , more important enhancement would be realized due to better coverage of the sky .",
    "an analogy with radio astronomy using an array of antennas may be appropriate to mention in this context .",
    "as the earth rotates , the projections of the radio antenna baselines on the plane perpendicular to the source direction sample different points on the two dimensional fourier plane ( commonly known as the @xmath314-@xmath315 plane ) .",
    "the sampled fourier plane is then inverse transformed to generate the image .",
    "while the _ highest resolution _ of the network is limited by the projection of maximum antenna separation , addition of more antennas to the network ensures better sampling of the @xmath314-@xmath315 plane reducing the side lobes , thereby producing a more faithful image of the sky .",
    "detailed introduction to the basic principles of earth rotation aperture synthesis can be found in most of the standard texts on radio astronomy , e.g. , @xcite . in gw radiometry with a network of detectors",
    "we expect that a similar scenario will arise - better coverage of the sky should be possible due to different orientations of the baselines with respect to the source .",
    "moreover , since the true power distribution will be estimated from an over - constrained set of equations , the error in the estimated quantities will be reduced .",
    "in addition , a radiometer search can benefit from certain technical advantages that a network of detectors can provide : a detector at a third site joining the ligo detectors will boost the `` single - baseline integration time '' , i.e. , the single - baseline duty - cycle in a three - site network will be at least as good as , but will likely be better than , that in a two - site network .",
    "also , owing to common instrumental noise sources in the ligo detectors , certain frequency bands are currently notch - filtered in computing the cross - correlation statistic .",
    "some of these noise sources are known not to affect virgo and , therefore , the ligo - virgo cross - correlation statistics .",
    "for example , the power - line noise affects the ligo detectors at the harmonics of 60hz , whereas it affects the virgo detector at the harmonics of 50hz .",
    "therefore , a radiometer search that benefits from the ligo - virgo baseline s contribution will probe the presence of astrophysical signals over a larger set of frequencies than one limited to the baseline consisting of the ligo pair of detectors .",

    "one can see that the dirty maps have lost all the fine structures present in the injected maps .",
    "furthermore , they show certain features that were not even present in the injected map .",
    "also , the pixel values in the dirty maps are spread over a range consisting of large positive and almost equally negative values .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffmap - c ] shows the clean maps recovered by @xmath389 cg iterations .",
    "clearly , many of the features of the injected maps have been recovered in the clean maps , which is also evident from the lower values of nmse , @xmath390 and @xmath391 respectively . also , the positivity of the estimated map has been vastly improved - the pixel values of the clean maps lie mostly on the positive side , as one should expect .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : diffmap - d ] shows the masked clean maps obtained by using a @xmath392 threshold .",
    "though the masked maps give better visual impression , masking can actually discard several pixels which have weak sources , thereby increasing the nmse . in figure",
    "[ fig : diffmap - d ] , for example , masking increases nmse to @xmath393 and @xmath390 respectively , though the masked maps look more similar to the injected maps shown in figure  [ fig : diffmap - a ] , than the unmasked clean maps in figure  [ fig : diffmap - c ] .",
    "the stochastic astrophysical gw background is likely to be dominated by sources in the nearby anisotropic universe , so the detection of localized sources is more favorable than the all - sky - averaged search . making a skymap of the sgwb sky",
    "has been a long standing ambition of stochastic gw research .",
    "different analysis methods have been proposed to create skymaps by measuring the first few spherical harmonic multipoles of the sky .",
    "here we have presented a direct approach of directed gw radiometer analysis . in this approach , the whole sky is decomposed in a discrete set of pixels and the contribution from each pixel is measured separately by correlating phase shifted detector outputs to generate the whole skymap , which is a clear application of earth rotation aperture synthesis .",
    "specifically , for the agwb detection statistic , we have defined a correlation statistic with a directed optimal filter that targets a fixed point in the sky by adjusting the time - delay across a baseline to track its rotation with the earth .",
    "this statistic however provides us with a dirty map of the sky which we numerically deconvolve to obtain the true skymap . for this purpose ,",
    "we have employed the conjugate gradient method .",
    "we numerically implement the deconvolution on simulated unpolarised gw sky maps obtained with the ligo detector baseline .",
    "the success of this method is demonstrated by the recovery of simulated source distributions , namely , ( i )  of a point source , ( ii )  of a diffuse source in the equatorial plane , and ( iii )  of a diffuse source off the equatorial plane .",
    "this work needs to be implemented on other baselines of the upcoming / future network of detectors such as ligo - virgo , ligo - lcgt , lisa etc .",
    "the outline of the analysis has been presented here .",
    "however , further detailed analysis and the implementation is a future goal . even for the single baseline , spa analysis shows that , perhaps a more efficient method of deconvolution , yielding better accuracy and convergence , lower computational costs and convenience of application may be possible using more sophisticated analysis , for example , one involving basis functions .",
    "the maximum likelihood framework presented here is , in fact , independent of any particular choice of basis .",
    "so once a suitable basis is chosen , rest of the analysis can be applied without requiring any major change .",
    "it may also be possible to deconvolve only a patch of the sky using a similar method  @xcite .",
    "the work presented in this paper should also benefit two other searches .",
    "first , since the long - duration integration of the data will essentially comprise a sum over short stretches , a large signal in a short stretch will constitute a candidate for a transient or burst ( short - duration ) event . unlike the coincidence search being currently conducted for such events , our work will combine coherently the outputs of several detectors and , thus ,",
    "improve their detectability .",
    "second , the long - duration integration of the data should be able to find gravitational wave signals from modelled sources , such as pulsars .",
    "although our method is optimal for searching unmodelled sources , it is not so for pulsars , the signals from which can be matched filtered .",
    "the problem with the latter method is that owing to the very large parameter space volume , an all - sky , all - frequency search for pulsars with matched filtering is not computationally viable .",
    "our proposed method is not handicapped by this problem since it does not use the intrinsic source parameters for the search ; rather it uses the data from one detector to ` filter ' that from others in the network , after appropriately time - shifting them and weighting them with the respective antenna patterns .",
    "thus , our method can be used as the first step in a two - step hierarchical search for pulsars , where triggers from our method are followed up with matched filtering .",

    "<S> the problem of the detection and mapping of a stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) , either cosmological or astrophysical , bears a strong semblance to the analysis of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy and polarization , which too is a stochastic field , statistically described in terms of its correlation properties . </S>",
    "<S> an astrophysical gravitational wave background ( agwb ) will likely arise from an incoherent superposition of unmodelled and/or unresolved sources and cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds ( cgwb ) are also predicted in certain scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the basic statistic we use is the cross - correlation between the data from a pair of detectors . in order to ` point ' the pair of detectors at different locations one must suitably delay the signal by the amount it takes for the gravitational waves ( gw ) to travel to both detectors corresponding to a source direction . then the raw ( observed ) sky map of the sgwb is the signal convolved with a beam response function that varies with location in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> we first present a thorough analytic understanding of the structure of the beam response function using an analytic approach employing the stationary phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the true sky map is obtained by numerically deconvolving the beam function in the integral ( convolution ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the maximum likelihood framework to estimate the true sky map using the conjugate gradient method that has been successfully used in the broadly similar , well - studied cmb map making problem . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically implement and demonstrate the method on signal generated by simulated ( unpolarized ) sgwb for the gw radiometer consisting of the ligo pair of detectors at hanford and livingston . </S>",
    "<S> we include ` realistic ' additive gaussian noise in each data stream based on the ligo - i noise power spectral density . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the method to multiple baselines and polarized gwb is outlined . in the near future the network of gw detectors , including the advanced ligo and virgo detectors that will be sensitive to sources within a thousand times larger spatial volume , could provide promising data sets for gw radiometry . </S>"
