    "control and eradication of infectious diseases are among the most important goals for improving public health .",
    "although the global eradication of a disease ( e.g. smallpox ) has been achieved  @xcite , it is difficult to accomplish and remains a public health target for polio , malaria , and many other diseases , including childhood diseases  @xcite .",
    "the global eradication of a disease is not the only type of disease extinction process .",
    "for example , a disease may `` fade out '' or become locally extinct in a region .",
    "since the extinction is local , the disease may be reintroduced from other regions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , extinction may also occur to individual strains of a multistrain disease  @xcite , such as influenza or dengue fever .",
    "it is worth noting that the extinction process is also of interest in the fields of evolution and ecology . as an example",
    ", bio - diversity arises from the interplay between the introduction and extinction of species  @xcite .    in order to predict the dynamics of disease outbreak and spread as well as to implement control strategies which promote disease extinction",
    ", one must investigate how model parameters affect the probability of extinction .",
    "for example ,  @xcite showed that disease control and extinction depend on both epidemiological and sociological parameters determining epidemic growth rate .",
    "additionally , since extinction occurs in finite populations , another factor in determining extinction risk is the local community size  @xcite .",
    "further complications arise from the fact that in general , stochastic effects cause random transitions within the discrete , finite populations",
    ". these stochastic effects may be intrinsic to the system or may arise from the external environment .",
    "small population size , low contact frequency for frequency - dependent transmission , competition for resources , and evolutionary pressure  @xcite , as well as heterogeneity in populations and transmission  @xcite may all be determining factors for extinction to occur .",
    "other factors which can affect the risk of extinction include the nature and strength of the noise  @xcite , disease outbreak amplitude  @xcite , and seasonal phase occurrence  @xcite .    in large populations , the intensity of the intrinsic noise is often quite small .",
    "however , it is possible that a rare , large fluctuation which occurs with finite probability can cause the system to reach the extinct state .",
    "since the extinct state is absorbing due to effective stochastic forces , eventual extinction is guaranteed when there is no source of reintroduction  @xcite . however , because fade outs are usually rare events in large populations , typical time scales for extinction may be extremely long .",
    "birth - death systems  @xcite , which possess intrinsic noise , form an important class of stochastic processes .",
    "these systems have been used in the field of mathematical epidemiology  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the intrinsic noise arises from the discreteness of the individuals ( or species ) and the randomness of their interactions .",
    "to predict probabilities of events occurring at certain times , a description of the stochastic system is provided using the master equation formalism .",
    "stochastic master equations are commonly used in statistical physics when dealing with chemical reaction processes  @xcite .    for systems with a large number of individuals ,",
    "a van kampen system - size expansion may be used to approximate the master equation by a fokker - planck equation  @xcite",
    ". however , the technique fails in determining the probability of large fluctuations  @xcite . instead",
    ", in this article , we will employ an eikonal approximation to recast the problem in terms of an effective classical hamiltonian system  @xcite . with high probability",
    ", the intrinsic noise will induce extinction of the disease or species along a heteroclinic trajectory in the phase space of the classical hamiltonian flow .",
    "this trajectory is known as the optimal path ( to extinction ) .",
    "it is highly desirable to locate the optimal path since the extinction rate depends on the probability to traverse this path .",
    "additionally , the effect of a control strategy on the extinction rate can be determined by its effect on the optimal path  @xcite . through the use of the eikonal approximation",
    ", we consider a mechanistic dynamical systems problem rather than the original stochastic problem .",
    "unlike other methods , this approach enables one both to estimate extinction lifetimes and to draw conclusions about the path taken to extinction .",
    "this more detailed understanding of how extinction occurs may lead to new stochastic control strategies  @xcite .",
    "in general , the optimal path to extinction is an unstable dynamical object .",
    "therefore , many researchers have investigated the scaling of extinction rates with respect to a parameter near a bifurcation point , where the dynamics are slow  @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculation of extinction rates far from a bifurcation point is much more difficult , and thus , researchers often resort to averaging over many stochastic runs  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical computation of the optimal path trajectory has been achieved in the past using a shooting method  @xcite . however , since the procedure is very sensitive to boundary conditions , it is difficult to implement when analyzing paths far away from bifurcation points or when analyzing high - dimensional models .    in this article",
    "we develop a novel method for computing the optimal extinction trajectory that relies on the calculation of the dynamical system s finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftle ) .",
    "the classical lyapunov exponent provides a quantitative measure of how infinitesimally close particles in a dynamical system behave asymptotically as time @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the ftle provides a quantitative measure of how much nearby particles separate after a specific amount of time has elapsed .",
    "the ftle fields were used by  @xcite and  @xcite to characterize structures , including mixing regions and transport barriers , in the atmosphere .",
    "later , these structures were quantified more rigorously by introducing the idea of lagrangian coherent structures ( lcs )  @xcite .",
    "the definition of a lcs as a ridge of the ftle field was introduced by  @xcite and formalized by  @xcite .",
    "the ftle method provides a measure of how sensitively the system s future behavior depends on its current state , and the lcs , or ridge , is a structure which has locally maximal ftle value . in this article",
    ", we will show that the system displays maximum sensitivity near the optimal extinction trajectory , which enables us to dynamically evolve toward the optimal escape trajectory using ftle calculations .    in this article , we consider three standard epidemic models that contain intrinsic or external noise sources and illustrate the power of our method to locate the optimal path to extinction .",
    "even though our examples are taken from infectious disease models , the approach is applicable to any extinction process or escape process .",

    "[ sec : ftle ] describes the theory that underlies the lyapunov exponent computations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : apps ] , our method is used to find the optimal path to extinction for three examples . in sec .",

    "to introduce the idea of constructing an optimal path in stochastic dynamical systems , we consider the problem of extinction taken from mathematical epidemiology . the stochastic formulation of the problem accounts for the random state transitions which govern the dynamics of the system . to quantitatively account for the randomness in the system",
    ", we will formulate a master equation which describes the time evolution of the probability of finding the system in a particular state at a certain time  @xcite .",
    "the state variables @xmath1 of the system describe the components of a population , while the random state transitions which govern the dynamics are described by the transition rates @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is an increment in the change of @xmath4 .",
    "consideration of the net change in increments of the state of the system results in the following master equation for the probability density @xmath5 of finding the system in state @xmath4 at time @xmath6 : @xmath7.\\label{e : masterequation}\\ ] ]    if the total population size of the system is @xmath8 , the components of the state variable can be rescaled to be fractions of the population by letting @xmath9 .",
    "then the general solution  @xcite for the transition probability from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in the time interval from @xmath12 to @xmath6 can be written as the following path integral : @xmath13\\right \\},\\label{e : probdensity}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes integration over all paths .",
    "the integral in the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ e : probdensity ] ) is the action , and the hamiltonian @xmath15 is given in general as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is defined as the transition rate @xmath18 per individual .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath19 depends both on the state of the system @xmath11 as well as the momentum @xmath20 , which provides an effective force due to stochastic fluctuations on the system .",
    "it should be noted that instead of using the hamiltonian representation , one could use the lagrangian representation , which results in the following alternative solution : @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the action reveals much information about the probability evolution of the system , from scaling near bifurcation points in non - gaussian processes to rates of extinction as a function of epidemiological parameters  @xcite . in order to maximize the probability of extinction",
    ", one must minimize the action .",
    "the minimizing formulation entails finding the solution to the hamilton - jacobi equation , which means that one must solve the @xmath23-dimensional system of hamilton s equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions of the system are such that a solution starts at a non - zero state , such as an endemic state , and asymptotically approaches one or more zero components of the state vector .",
    "therefore , a trajectory that is a solution to the two - point boundary value problem determines a path , which in turn yields the probability of going from the initial state to the final state .",
    "the optimal path to extinction is the path that minimizes the action in either the hamiltonian or lagrangian representation .    to illustrate an application of the theory for a finite population , we consider in detail an explicit example , namely the well - known problem of extinction in a susceptible - infectious - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model . in this example , the population consists of @xmath26 susceptible individuals and @xmath27 infectious individuals .",
    "the population is driven via the birth rate @xmath28 , which is also equal to the death rate .",

    "for an epidemic model , this means that the reproductive rate of infection is greater than but very close to one .",
    "however , most real diseases have reproductive rates of infection greater than @xmath61  @xcite , which translates into faster growth rates from the extinct state . in general , in order to get analytic scaling results",

    "the hamiltonian or lagrangian representation of an @xmath62-dimensional dynamical system lies in @xmath23-dimensional space .",
    "therefore , for even relatively low - dimensional dynamical systems , the use of a shooting method to find the optimal path to extinction can be quite problematic . in the next section ,",

    "if one chooses an initial point on either side of the path near the endemic state , the two trajectories will separate exponentially in time .",
