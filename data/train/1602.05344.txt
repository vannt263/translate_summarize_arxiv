    "the standard quantum limit ( sql ) is a limitation of quantum noise that universally exists in every precise measurement @xcite .",
    "the sql is understood as the trade - off between quantum sensing noise and quantum backaction noise @xcite , which arises from the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "particularly , quantum noise in the interaction between the translational motion of a suspended mirror and the electromagnetic field of the laser has been investigated intensively for the reduction of quantum noise in interferometric gravitational wave detectors @xcite and the realization of a macroscopic quantum mechanical state @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that it is possible to surpass the sql in the translational motion of a suspended mirror by detecting the electromagnetic field reflected from the mirror with homodyne detection to exploit the correlation between quantum sensing noise and quantum backaction noise that is produced by ponderomotive squeezing of the field @xcite .",
    "however , quantum noise in the interaction between the angular motion of a suspended mirror and the electromagnetic of the laser has not been investigated sufficiently . because every degree of freedom is equivalent in the context of the realization of a macroscopic quantum mechanical state , to investigate the quantum noise in the measurement of the angular motion of a suspended mirror is as important as the translational motion of a suspended mirror . in this article , therefore , an expression for quantum noise in an optical lever for the measurement of the angular displacement of a suspended mirror is derived .",
    "this expression is explained in analogy with the quantum noise in the measurement of the translational motion of a suspended mirror .",
    "first , let us summarize the background knowledge and the definition of notation . the electric field of a laser",
    "is well described with hermite - gaussian ( hg ) modes @xcite . in this article , the following definition of hg modes @xmath0 is used : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are angular frequency and wave number of the modes , respectively , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are non - negative integers that characterize modes .",
    "the symbols used above are defined as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the beam width at the beam waist ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the gouy phase , rayleigh range , beam width , radius of curvature , and hermite polynomial of @xmath11-th order , respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is orthonormal in the sense that @xmath12 an arbitrary electric field @xmath13 described with hg modes takes the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the power of the light characterized by this @xmath13 and @xmath16 is a numerical coefficient . throughout this article ,",
    "a certain polarization is considered and we deal with the light within the range of paraxial approximation , i.e. an electric field can be regarded as a scalar .",
    "it was shown @xcite that if we have laser light which can be characterized by the fundamental hg mode and its path is displaced by @xmath17 and/or tilted by @xmath18 in the @xmath19-axis direction from the @xmath20-axis , the electric field of the light takes the form : @xmath21 here we define @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ tilt ] ) can be derived by expanding @xmath23 and taking the terms up to the first order of @xmath17 and @xmath18 and the leading order of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 equation ( [ coord ] ) gives us an exact interpretation of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; @xmath17 represents the displacement of the light path from the @xmath20-axis at the waist of the beam , and @xmath18 is the tilt of the light path from the @xmath20-axis . here and",

    "homodyne detection is realized by measuring the power of light which is superposition of the quantum field to be measured and local oscillator field with phase difference between these fields controlled at certain value .",
    "this phase difference is the homodyne angle . from eq .",

    "note that at the frequency where @xmath79 , radiation pressure noise is cancelled and the sql , @xmath80 , is beaten .",

    ", it is assumed that the radius of curvature of the beam at the mirror and the radius of curvature of the mirror coincide .",

    "( [ com ] ) .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ 10d ] ) , which is a classical expression for the transverse displacement and tilt , quantum operators for the transverse displacement @xmath90 and tilt @xmath91 at @xmath34 can be identified as @xmath92 respectively .",
    "the fourier transforms of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are @xmath93       next , we consider the angular motion of the mirror located at @xmath94 and the reflected laser light , as shown in fig .",

    "table [ table ] summarizes the analogy between the quantum noise in the measurement of the translational motion and the angular motion of a mirror .",
    "this expression for the noise spectrum shows that @xmath117 , the gouy phase shift from the mirror to the position of detection , corresponds to the homodyne angle of the measurement of the translational motion of a mirror .",
    "therefore , measurement of the transverse displacement of the light reflected by the mirror at modest distance from the mirror , i.e. @xmath118 , can be regarded as homodyne detection . if @xmath119 , which corresponds , for example , to the case that the separation between the mirror and the position of detection is sufficiently larger than the rayleigh range and the light is detected at the beam waist , i.e. @xmath120 , @xmath121 , eq . ( [ 10noise ] ) is simplified as @xmath122 the first and the second terms inside the brackets originate in the fluctuation of the angle of the mirror caused by the fluctuation of the transverse displacement of the incident light and the fluctuation of the angle that the incident light has had before hitting the mirror , respectively",
    "therefore , they are analogs of radiation pressure noise and shot noise , respectively .",
    "we call the first term radiation torque noise . from eq .",
    "( [ sql ] ) we can see that @xmath123 is always larger than @xmath124 even if the power or the beam width of the incident laser light is varied .",
    "in other words , this formula shows that @xmath125 is the sql of the measurement of the angle of a mirror .",
    "equation ( [ 10noise ] ) also indicates that at the frequency where the condition @xmath126 holds , radiation torque noise is completely cancelled .",
    "therefore , by choosing the appropriate position of measurement @xmath127 , radiation torque noise at a certain frequency can be cancelled and the sql can be beaten , in a similar way to the radiation pressure noise cancellation by choosing the appropriate homodyne angle .",
    "we will also discuss these results in terms of interaction between orbital angular momentum of light and motion of the mirror reflecting the light .",
    "backaction to the suspended mirror in our configuration can be explained by interaction between the transverse @xmath128 component of optical angular momentum of the laser light and angular motion of the mirror .",
    "in fact , it was shown that light which is characterized by a linear combination of hg00 mode and 10 mode has a non - zero @xmath129 component of orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "in contrast , interaction between the longitudinal ( @xmath20 ) component of orbital angular momentum of light and a mirror made of a spiral phase element that reflects the light has been investigated to utilize it to cool the rotational motion of the mirror about the @xmath20-axis , in which direction the light propagates @xcite .",
    "therefore , comparison of our results and this previous work indicates that our present approach might also be applicable to addressing the quantum limit in the measurement of rotation of a mirror about the @xmath20-axis .",
