    "consider some decision making process @xmath0 which arises quite frequently in many scientific researches as well as in daily life events .",
    "given several candidates ( or selections ) to choose , we must choose one candidate ( selection ) by using the voting scheme or by matching the features extracted from the entire area ( or the nation ) .",
    "we call this @xmath0 as a global voting ( or matching ) method .",
    "many countries adopt the system in choosing a president of the country as a peruvian president .",
    "now let us convert @xmath0 to a new version @xmath1 , where we decide the winner of each pre - divided regions by @xmath0 but we make the final decision by a simple majority of the number of the winning regions by adopting the  winners - take - all \" principle within the pre - divided regions .",
    "the latter converted version @xmath1 is called a regional voting ( or matching ) method .",
    "a most typical regional voting method is the us presidential election system .",
    "it is the robustness of the decision making by @xmath0 or @xmath1 processes that we want to clarify in the present analysis against a concentrated type of noise .    here",
    ", @xmath0 could be any decision making procedure . in the simple voting system",
    ", @xmath0 makes use of voting and makes a decision by the majority of votes counted . in the facial recognition problem , for example ,",
    "@xmath0 based on this voting system may involve a pixel - by - pixel comparison between the two facial images to be compared or we could use any of well - known dimension - reducing schemes such as the principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite or a gabor transform @xcite as @xmath0 , the former pca scheme leading to the famous eigenface method @xcite .",
    "the resulting reduced facial space of pca is instrumental in obtaining the major eigenfaces of the training , for example and it is easy to find the co - ordinate of a new face projected into the facial space , and then make a recognition decision by matching the projection with stored images of models .",
    "then the corresponding @xmath1 could be implemented first by dividing the whole two dimensional picture of rectangle frame into smaller regions ( of equal size in our analysis ) . within each region",
    "we make use of the pca method in decision making as @xmath0 and we make the final decision of the whole picture in accordance with the simple majority principle in the number of the winning regions where the winner gets all the votes of the region .",
    "it is the improved stability of @xmath1 over that of @xmath0 that has motivated our current research as verified by several convincing numerical examples given in this paper .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to elucidate and clarify a basic mechanism why the regional matching method has an advantage in stability over the global matching scheme against noise .",
    "a simplest voting model is selected for analysis where each cell in the nation consists of one vote , thus @xmath0 itself can be regarded as a simple national voting scheme where the winner is decided by a simple majority principle . to simplify the analysis on the regional matching",
    ", we divide the nation into smaller regions of equal size where the winner is decided by the number of winning regions , the winner of a region being decided by @xmath0 .",
    "we set up a noise - and - voting model for this simple situation and show that when the size of the regions is reasonably small , the regional voting scheme is more stable than the national voting scheme .",
    "a conjecture is made that this model is valid in a more general decision making process where @xmath0 involves a decision making process by pca matching or gabor matching .",
    "we present a convincing experimental verification to support the conjecture in appendix .",
    "the present paper is constructed as follows . in section [ sec : theorems ] , we first give precise definitions on noise , noise - concentrated area and the number of noise - contaminated regions including basic assumptions used in the analysis .",
    "we prove theorem [ th:1 ] which relates the noise - concentrated area and the number of potential noise - contaminated regions .",
    "theorem [ th:2 ] shows how we can improve the relation .",
    "the resulting corollaries [ cor:1 ] and [ cor:2 ] corresponding to theorems [ th:1 ] and [ th:2 ] respectively give the lower bounds of the noise level to a breakdown point of decision beyond which the decision of the voting may overturn . in section [ sec : conclusion - discussion ] , we examine the results of section [ sec : theorems ] from various angles . a very convincing experimental verification of the theory is presented in section [ sec : black - white ] using a black - and - white flag recognition problem confirming the validity of the theory on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "an experimental verification given in appendix supports the conjecture that the theory developed for the pixel - by - pixel voting process remains valid for more general decision making processes involving dimension reducing schemes such as pca or gabor transform .",
    "important notations and basic assumptions used in the paper will be summarized here .",
    "we suppose that the nation ( or the entire image for an image application ) consists of @xmath2 unit cells ( or pixels ) each having one vote to exercise ; for simplicity the nation is always represented by a rectangle of size @xmath3 , so that @xmath4 .",
    "the nation on the other hand can be partitioned into @xmath5 square , equal sized regions of @xmath6 each .",
    "we also assume that both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are divisible by @xmath9 and that the pair of the opposing edges along the outer boundary of the rectangular nation are to glide onto the other end as glued together so that the nation can be partitioned into a total of @xmath10 different partitions . like @xmath9 which is the length scale of a square region ,",
    "@xmath11 denotes that of a noise - concentrated block , with the terms  noise \" and  noise - concentrated block \" being defined in definition 2 of next subsection .",
    "we analyze in this paper a very simplified model allowing only two candidates in the election , say , two candidates _ a _ and _ b_. without losing generality , we assume , in the absence of external sources of noise , @xmath12 of total cells vote for _ a _ and @xmath13 cells vote for _ b _ so that @xmath14    we discuss our possible extension to an @xmath15 candidates system in section [ subsubsec:3candidates ] we examine the effect of  concentrated \" noise on the decision making process of election results by the global voting and the regional voting . in image application , such noise",
    "is often observed in case the imagery contains transparency , specular reflections , shadows , fragmented occlusion as seen through branches of a tree or a sun shade and occlusion @xcite .    the formal definition of concentrated noise as well as the formal definition of the global voting and regional voting is given below .    @xmath16 _ national voting _ the entire population @xmath2 of the nation vote either for candidate _ a _ or _ b _ and candidate _ a _ wins _ if and only if _ he gets a majority of the @xmath2 votes .",
    "@xmath16 _ regional voting _ the population @xmath17 ( @xmath18 for @xmath5 regions ) of a region vote for candidate _ a _ or _ b _ and a majority of votes determine the candidate of the region and a majority of the @xmath5 winning regions , not the majority of the entire population @xmath2 of the nation , determines the winner for the nation .",
    "@xmath16 we call a set of noise _ anti - a - noise _ ( or _ anti - b - noise _ ) if all the cells under influence will vote for _ b _ ( or _ a _ ) regardless of whether it originally votes for _ a _ or _ b_. the number of the cells under influence",
    "is called the number of noise units .",
    "@xmath16 we call a vote noise - contaminated if the vote of a cell happens to undergo a change either from candidate _",
    "a _ to _ b _ or from candidate _",
    "b _ to _ a _ under some changes of environmental conditions . the noise - contaminated vote undergoing a change from candidate _",
    "a _ to _ b _ ( or _ b _ to _ a _ ) is especially called _ anti - a - noise - contaminated vote _ ( or _ anti - b - noise - contaminated vote _ ) respectively .",

    "@xmath16 the anti-_a_-noise - concentrated ( anti-_b_-noise - concentrated ) area is defined as the union of all anti-_a_-noise - concentrated ( anti-_b_-noise - concentrated ) blocks .",
    "@xmath16 the region is defined to be anti-_a_-noise - contaminated ( anti-_b_-noise - contaminated ) _ if and only if _ the conjunction set of the region and the anti-_a_-noise - concentrated ( anti-_b_-noise - concentrated ) area is not empty .    in the analysis",
    ", we assume that there is only anti-_a_-noise .",
    "[ asp : onlya ] the effects of anti-_b_-noise on election results will be ignored in the analysis .",
    "this assumption will be justified for the following two reasons .",
    "firstly the anti-_b_-noise and the anti-_a_-noise are independent so that we may consider the effect of the anti-_a_-noise entirely independent of the anti-_b_-noise .",
    "secondly we want to establish a lower bound to a breakdown point in the prevailing situation of @xmath20 .",
    "we see that the anti-_a_-noise gives a lower bound in terms of a noise level up to which we can accommodate before the results of the regional as well as the global voting reverse or overturn .",
    "the result for the regional voting will be established in theorems [ th:1 ] and [ th:2 ] and corollaries [ cor:1 ] and [ cor:2 ] while the exact bound for the national voting is given in observation [ obs:1 ] .",
    "as we have emphasized , we only consider locally  concentrated \" noise .",
    "thus we have :    [ asp : concentrated - only ] all the anti-_a_-noise is within anti-_a_-noise - concentrated area .",
    "this assumption will always hold , because we can regard a smallest block size of a single cell as the size of a noise - concentrated block at a worst case . for general cases of @xmath19 cells excluding blocks consisting of single cell size , it is not difficult to conclude that a possible error between the anti-_a_-noise of the nation and the anti-_a_-noise - concentrated area becomes negligibly small as the size of each of the noise - influenced areas increases sufficiently",
    ". thus this assumption will not affect the validity of all the following theorems .",
    "we will clarify the situation in observation [ obs:3 ] of section [ subsubsec : sizeofblock ] .",

    "[ asp : averagedistribution ]    @xmath16 _ average distribution assumption _ we assume that in the absence of noise , the voting distribution of the undisturbed national voting prevails in _ any _ sufficiently large size areas whether consisting of a continuous part of the nation or of randomly chosen blocks of cells .    @xmath16 _ region size _ we assume that the size of equally partitioned regions is sufficiently large so that in the absence of noise , the average distribution assumption above holds .",
    "the assumption implies that , in the absence of noise , the global voting behavior of _ a% _ and _ b% _ prevails in each of the regions such that there are almost _",
    "a%(n / k ) _ cells voting for _ a _ and _ b%(n / k ) _ cells voting for _",
    "b_. this assumption can be relaxed ( see section [ subsubsec : relaxing ] ) .",
    "we conclude that , if candidate _ a _ ( or _ b _ ) wins in the nation , so does candidate _ a _ ( or _ b _ ) in each of the regions .",
    "[ obs:1 ] if there exists more than @xmath21 of anti-_a_-noise - contaminated votes , that is , if @xmath22 of the original votes cast for _ a _ should change to _ b _ , then the noise is effective in reversing the candidate selection from _ a _ to _ b _ in the national voting .",
    "we say the national voting can accommodate @xmath21 noise before a reversal of the original voting result takes place .",
    "we call a region anti-_a_-noise - contaminated _ if and only if _ the conjunction set of the region and the anti-_a_-noise - concentrated area is not empty .",
    "the following lemma shows that we can construct a partitioning of the nation such that the noise - concentrated blocks are concentrated into some fractions of all the regions .",
    "it gives a clue why the regional voting is capable of accommodating a higher noise level than the averaged national voting because only a fraction of the entire regions absorb the dominant effects of the noise superimposed .",
    "[ lem ] for any given small positive integer @xmath23 , we can always choose a partition of the rectangle nation into @xmath5 regions such that anti-_a_-noise is concentrated among a fractional @xmath24 regions of the @xmath5 regions ( @xmath25 ) so that the total size of these @xmath24 regions is less than that of the anti-_a_-concentrated area plus @xmath23 units .",
    "the lemma can be proved directly by considering the worst case : namely we can always divide the rectangle at worst case into @xmath26 regions of unit size , which means the above difference always vanishes .",
    "note that depending on the number of @xmath23 and the distribution of anti-_a_-contaminated noise , we do not always have to divide the nation into regions of unit size and a noise - concentrated block can be found , fulfilling the conclusion of the lemma .",
    "the following theorems show the relations of the size of anti-_a_-noise - concentrated area and the total size of anti-_a_-noise - contaminated regions in the worst case which lead to the lower bounds to a breakdown point of decision .",
    "[ th:1 ] let @xmath27 be the size of anti-_a_-noise - concentrated area and @xmath28 be the total size of anti-_a_-noise - contaminated regions of k - partitioned regional voting .",

    "2 .   @xmath30 is a sufficient condition for the regional voting to retain the original candidate selection of _",
    "a_.    item 1 of the theorem follows immediately for @xmath31 because for any combination of partitioning , each of the anti-_a_-noise - concentrated block of size @xmath32 can at best  contaminate \" @xmath33 equal size regions of @xmath34 .",
    "it is a simple matter to confirm that the conclusion is valid for @xmath35 as well .",
    "item 2 of the theorem comes from the fact that at most @xmath36 of the @xmath5 regions can be contaminated when @xmath30 .",

    "[ cor:1 ] the original candidate selection of _ a _ can accommodate at least @xmath37 anti-_a_-noise ( i.e. @xmath38 of the cells voting for _ a _ ) , before the candidate selection is reversed .",
    "theorem [ th:1 ] and corollary [ cor:1 ] show clearly that to retain the original candidate selection of _ a _ in the regional voting , a larger subdivision of the nation namely into a smaller size region leads to a higher stability , provided that assumption [ asp : averagedistribution ] on region size remains valid .",
    "the bounds of theorem [ th:1 ] and corollary [ cor:1 ] can be further improved by exploiting the _ shifting strategy _ of @xcite .",
    "we first define a _ shifting strategy _ for some operation @xmath39 with respect to a square region embedded within a rectangular nation .",

    "move all the horizontal lines up by one cell , execute action @xmath39 .",
    "the shifting strategy enumerates all the possible different partitioning of the nation .",
    "now by replacing action @xmath39 of the strategy with the regional voting subject to the same noise environment , we show by theorem [ th:2 ] below how we can improve theorem [ th:1 ] .",
    "[ th:2 ] under the assumptions of theorem [ th:1 ] , the shifting strategy ensures that there exists at least one partition satisfying the following properties :    1 .",

    ", we must show that among all the possible @xmath17 different partitions that the shifting strategy can possibly generate , each of @xmath19 size anti-_a_-noise - concentrated block is capable of contaminating the total of @xmath42 different regions .",
    "once this is done , the pigeon hole principle @xcite ensures that there is at least one partition in which the existing @xmath43 anti-_a_-noise - concentrated blocks contaminate at most @xmath44 regions .",

    "figures 4 and 5 represent the percentages of the regions which the correctly recognized faces have won . but note that the percentages of the maximum vote obtained differ considerably among the candidates depending on how the votes distribute among the candidates ; a high percentage of correctly recognized regions does not imply directly that the corresponding face is correctly recognized in the regional matching . examining the data of figures 4 and 5",
    ", we may make a general statement that the percentages of the winning regions for a correctly recognized candidate are almost always higher as the number of partitions increase .",
    "exceptions are shown in figure 5 when we divide the nation into too many regions .",
    "this behavior is confirmed by figure 6 where the recognition rates start to fall off as the number of regions increase beyond 384 which correspond to the region size of @xmath84 pixels for the entire image size of @xmath83 pixels .",
    "obviously when the region size is less than @xmath84 pixels , not only assumption [ asp : averagedistribution ] is invalidated but the eigenvector method may not give a meaningful result . figure 6 shows clearly that the regional matching always gives a better recognition rate than the national matching , and that the smaller the regions we choose , the higher recognition rate we will have for the regional matching .",
    "when the regions divided are too small , say , each region being of size less than @xmath84 pixels for 384 regions and @xmath103 pixels for 1600 regions in this example , the recognition rate will decrease and deteriorate .",
    "this very convincingly support the soundness of our theorems , implying also that the soundness of the average distribution assumption in section [ sec : theorems ] and the validity of the relaxing conditions on the assumption of section [ subsubsec : relaxing ] .",
    "the superiority of the regional matching is evident for images at lower noise level . for 16",
    "regional matching , 10 images out of 16 candidates are recognized correctly while for 384 regional partitioning , all 16 images are recognized correctly , while the turk and pendland s @xcite eigentemplate matching method on the whole image can only recognize 5 images out of 16 ( figure 6 ) . at a higher noise level ,",
    "16 regional matching recognizes only 1 images while 384 regional matching recognizes 6 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this should be compared with the global matching of one correct recognition . increasing the number of regions",
    "does not necessarily improve the results further .",
    "the numerical results for 1600 regions , which can recognize two , confirm this fact .",
    "this is a tradeoff problem on the size of the partitioned regions as discussed in section [ subsubsec : tradeoff ] .    the first motivation for this work arose from the entirely same situation in facial recognition problems by gabor wavelet analysis @xcite where the matching is carried out in @xmath104 gabor regions of window ( equivalent to @xmath104 partitioned regions in the present paper ) .",
    "we are able to identify the faces 100% using the images of 16 people under three different lighting conditions including head - on lighting , 45 degree lighting and 90 degree lighting conditions . on the contrary , by the global vote",
    "counting method where turk and pentland s original eigenface algorithm @xcite is used , we were able to correctly identify the faces with 87.5% accuracy .",
    "however , the comparison given there is not decisive in determining the superiority of the regional matching over the global matching .",
    "this is so because the regional matching involved the gabor transform as well as the eigenvector decomposition on one hand while the global matching did involve only the eigenvector decomposition .",

    "<S> we present a convincing experimental verification supporting not only the theory by a white - black flag recognition problem in the presence of localized noise but also the validity of the conjecture by a facial recognition problem that the theorem remains valid for other decision making processes involving an important dimension - reducing transform such as principal component analysis or a gabor transform .    </S>",
