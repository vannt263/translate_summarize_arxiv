    "molecular oxygen is a major component of the earth s atmosphere and is fundamental for life .",
    "it plays an important role in many natural and technological processes . in this paper",
    "we focus on the ability of low - energy electrons to dissociate molecular oxygen , in its fundamental electronic state , by means of resonant scattering .",
    "in particular we consider the state - by - state processes of dissociative electron attachment ( dea ) , @xmath5 and electron impact dissociation ( eid ) , @xmath6 for each oxygen vibrational level @xmath7 .",
    "the threshold for the process ( [ eq : dea_process ] ) is 3.64 ev , corresponding to the asymptotic energy of o and o@xmath8 fragments from the level @xmath9 , whereas for process ( [ eq : diss_process ] ) corresponds to the oxygen dissociation of 5.11 ev .",
    "such collisions are important to study phenomena occurring in the upper atmosphere , re - entry physics , electrical discharges and plasma chemistry .",
    "dea is the principal mechanisms , in molecular plasmas , for forming negative ions from neutral molecules ; the inverse process represents associative detachment .",
    "although significant theoretical and experimental effort has been invested in characterizing electron - o@xmath0 cross sections  @xcite , information is only available for the vibrational ground state of o@xmath0 for which both processes have rather small cross sections .",
    "here , we will show that dea and eid processes become much more important for vibrationally excited oxygen , as the corresponding cross sections increases by orders of magnitude with the excitation of the molecule .",
    "these cross sections represent fundamental input quantities in kinetics models of oxygen - containing non - equilibrium plasmas , where high - lying vibrational levels of molecules can be hugely populated .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in the section  [ tm ] we will give a brief account and numerical details on the adopted theoretical models for the calculation of the potential energy curves and on the description of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "the results are illustrated in section  [ r_d ] while the concluding remarks are given in section  [ con ] .",
    "many low - energy electron - molecule scattering processes are dominated by resonances . for molecular oxygen",
    "these processes can be quantitatively understood in term of four low - lying o@xmath10 resonances of symmetry @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath11 .",
