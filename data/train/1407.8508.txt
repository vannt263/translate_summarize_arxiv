    "it is widely believed that the origin of life required the formation of sets of molecules able to collectively self - replicate , as well as of compartments able to undergo fission and proliferate , i.e._protocells _  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in order to observe a lifelike behavior it was necessary that some of the chemical reactions were coupled to the rate of proliferation of the compartments .",
    "several protocell architectures have been proposed  @xcite , most of them identifying the compartment with a lipid vesicle that may spontaneously fission under suitable circumstances . on the other hand , many distinct models were proposed to describe sets of reactions involving randomly generated molecules  @xcite . in many cases , although this is not in principle required , it is assumed that only _ catalyzed _",
    "reactions take place at a significant rate , therefore these sets are also termed _ catalytic reaction sets _ ( briefly , crss ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the appearance of new molecules implies the appearance of new reactions involving those new molecules , so that both the set of molecular types and the set of reactions change in time .",
    "hence , it is possible that at a certain time a set of molecules able to catalyze each other s formation emerges  @xcite , and we will refer to it as an _ autocatalytic set _ ( acs ) .",
    "it can be noticed that a crs can contain one or more acss , or none . + even though some models of protocell actually describe the coupling between reaction networks and the dynamics of a lipid container , they consider only a fixed set of molecular species and reactions  @xcite , hence providing an incomplete representation of this complex interplay .",
    "conversely , while there are several studies on collectively self replicating sets of molecules in a _ continuously stirred open - flow tank reactor _",
    ", cstr  @xcite including our own  @xcite , they provide only limited information about the behavior of a protocell .",
    "therefore , in order to develop a framework that may unify the crss and the protocell modeling approaches , it is necessary i ) to analyze the behavior of crss in a vesicle , and ii ) to investigate the coupling of the evolving chemical population with the growth of the lipid container and its fission . in this paper we propose a step towards the first goal , while deferring the second one to a further work .",
    "in particular , we here analyze the behavior of a dynamical model of crss in a simplified model of a non - growing vesicle . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is a novel approach .",
    "+ a few important remarks .",
    "let us first observe that the cstr is not an _ a - priori _ good model of a protocell for at least two reasons : @xmath2 in general , in protocells there is no constant inflow and @xmath3 protocells have semipermeable membranes , which allow the inflow / outflow of some , but not all , molecular types .",
    "on the contrary , in open flow reactors all that is contained in the inflow enters the reactor and all that is dissolved in the reactor can be washed out in the outflow .",
    "another important limit of the cstr concerns its evolvability .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that the presence of different asymptotic dynamical states and the ability to shift between them may be essential to achieve the viable evolution of the first forms of life .",
    "recent works  @xcite have found that , in models of catalytic reaction networks in cstrs , generally only one of these states is found , apart from fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , in order to accomplish the goal of this work , we need to better specify both the model of catalytic reactions sets and that of the protocell .",
    "as far as the former is concerned , we have studied the dynamics of random sets of molecules by revisiting a model by kauffman , who proposed an interesting way to build new molecular species from the existing ones ( see section  [ sec : model ] for a description ) . the original version of the model relied on purely graph - theoretical arguments  @xcite , which are important , but fail to appreciate the effects of the dynamics , including noise , fluctuations and small - number effects .",
    "the dynamics has been later introduced by farmer et al .",
    "@xcite , who described the kinetics by using ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , this formalism does not account for",
    "the chance of a species to become extinct in a finite amount of time , as it may instead well happen ( so the reaction graph may grow but never shrinks ) . in order to overcome these limitations ,",
    "bagley proposed an empirical correction by setting to zero the concentration values that happen to fall below a certain threshold  @xcite . in our works",
    "we rather use from the very beginning a stochastic approach to analyze the dynamics , the well - known gillespie algorithm  @xcite , in order to deal in a rigorous way with low concentrations and with their fluctuations .",
    "+ note that the kauffman model largely relies upon randomness .",
    "in particular , every polymer in the system has a fixed probability ( that may vanish ) to catalyze any possible reaction .",
    "therefore , in different simulations the same species can catalyze different reactions leading to the formation of different _",
    "chemistries_. thus , this is exactly the language we choose : a set of tuples @xmath4 , where the species catalyzes the reaction , will be called  chemistry , because it describes a possible artificial world .",
    "we can then simulate different chemistries and look for generic properties of the set of chemistries ; but in a different series of experiments we can also keep the chemistry fixed , and simulate various time histories . in principle , these may differ , since the discovery of a given catalyst at an early phase in a finite system might channel the following evolution in a way or another . since the number of molecules of some species may be very small ,",
    "it is not in principle legitimate to ignore this aspect , and our stochastic model is particularly well suited to analyze it , as it will be shown in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "of course , there can be conditions where all the simulations of a given chemistry converge asymptotically to the same chemical mixture . + moving now to the protocell model , note that they are usually based on lipid vesicles , i.e. approximately spherical structures with an aqueous interior and a membrane composed by a lipid bilayer , which spontaneously form when lipids are mixed with water under certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "even though different protocell architectures have been proposed , we will here consider the simplest model , namely that in which all the key reactions take place in the aqueous phase _ inside _ the protocell .",
    "it would be indeed straightforward to model the coupling between some of these molecules and the growth of the protocell following an approach similar to that of our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "yet , the main objective of the present work is that of studying the dynamics of crss embedded in a vesicle , so we will simplify our treatment by ignoring the growth dynamics of the protocell , and keeping its volume fixed .",
    "this implies that our study will be limited to time intervals that are short with respect to those describing the growth of the whole protocell .",
    "+ the selective character of membranes is a key ingredient of our model : we will suppose for simplicity that all ( and only ) the molecules that are shorter than a certain length can cross the membrane .",
    "the transmembrane motion of the permeable species is here supposed to be driven by the difference of their concentrations in the internal aqueous volume of the protocell and in the external aqueous environment .",
    "we will assume that transmembrane diffusion is extremely fast , so that there is always equilibrium between the concentrations of the species that can cross the membrane ; this adiabatic hypothesis could be easily relaxed in the future .",
    "furthermore , we assume that protocells are turgid , so that the constant - volume approximation implies that we will also neglect issues related to osmotic pressure .",
    "another related aspect of the model is that , since it is assumed that the permeable species are at equilibrium , while the non - permeable ones never cross the barriers , infinite concentration growth is possible ; this is obviously a nonphysical behavior , so the model validity is limited in time .",
    "all these simplifications , which will be removed in subsequent studies , are also justified by the fact that our main goal is that of studying how the dynamics of crss are affected by being embedded in a vesicle .",
    "+ this model can be used in order to investigate the behavior of the system in different conditions and to address some important questions .",
    "the first and perhaps most important one is the reason why compartments seem to be necessary for life .",
    "indeed , the very first studies on self - replicating molecules  @xcite were not interested in this aspect , so the crss were supposed to exist , e.g. , in a pond or in a beaker . yet life seems to require compartments , that are ubiquitous .",
    "it is then important to understand whether there are major differences between what may happen in a protocell and what happens in the bulk phase",
    ". it would be unconvincing to postulate _ a priori _ that the internal and external environments are different .",
    "it is indeed more likely to assume that the vesicles form in a pre - existing aqueous environment , so the average internal milieu is essentially the same as the external one .",
    "then , if a membrane surrounds a portion of the fluid , what can happen that makes a difference ?",
    "+ let us first observe that protocells are small ( their typical linear dimensions ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) .",
    "if we imagine that a population of protocells exists , and they are not  overcrowed , their total internal volume will typically be much smaller than the total external volume ( this is _ a fortiori _",
    "true for an isolated one ) . moreover ,",
    "every point in the interior of a protocell is not allowed to be far away from the surface of the protocell that contains it .",
    "these observations imply that the effect of surfaces will be much larger within protocells then outside them .",
    "suppose for example that the membrane hosts some catalytic activities , so that important molecules are synthesized close to its boundaries , both inside and outside , and diffuse freely .",
    "if the membrane width is much smaller than the protocell radius , then the internal and external surface areas are very close to each other , but the external volume is much larger than the external one : therefore the internal concentrations will be much higher than those in the external environment . in this case , the system behavior in the interior can be significantly different from the external one  @xcite .",
    "note also that this effect may be different for different molecules : the formation of some of them might be catalyzed by the membrane , while others might be unaffected : so even the relative concentrations of different chemicals may differ in the two cases .",
    "+ indeed , there are important protocell models that are based on such an active catalytic role of the membrane  @xcite . in these cases",
    "it is easy to understand what the role of the protocell is , since it provides essential catalysts and a way to keep their products closer . but protocells might be able to give rise to an internal environment different from the bulk even if the catalytic activity is absent .",
    "the reason for this seemingly counterintuitive behavior is , once again , the smallness of the protocells .",
    "note that we are considering a case where new molecules are formed ( from those that are already in the interior of the protocell plus those that can cross the semipermeable membrane ) .",
    "if the concentrations are not too high , it is likely that the total numbers of newly formed molecules are quite low , so that different protocells might host different groups of molecules .",
    "it might even happen that a molecular type is present in some protocells and not in others .",
    "+ in order to get a feeling for this possibility , let us provide some realistic estimates of the number of molecules of different types that can be present in a protocell .",
    "let us consider typical vesicles ( linear dimension about @xmath7 ) and small ones ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "typical concentrations of macromolecules may be in the millimolar to nanomolar range ; the excepted numbers of molecules in a single protocell are therefore given in table  [ tab : expnumofmols ] .",
    ".excepted number of molecules of a given species in a given protocell ; rows refer to protocell volumes , columns to concentrations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we introduced a simplified model of a non - growing protocell and we investigated the behavior of a stochastic model of catalytic reaction networks in such an environment . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is a novel approach",
    ".    the crucial importance of the small size of the protocell has been stressed , and the effects of the fact that some chemicals can be present in low numbers have been investigated . while a broader analysis is ongoing , we have here shown that it is possible to reach different compositions of the chemical species , in the particular case in which some species are present in the bulk at low concentrations .",
    "we have also shown that there are two different , possibly overlapping reasons for this diversity : @xmath0 the random sequence of molecular events involving those species and @xmath1 the random differences in their initial concentrations .",
    "we have also stressed the importance of raf sets in influencing the overall dynamics .",
    "there are several ways in which this work might seed further research .",
    "the most obvious is that of relaxing the physical limitations that have been considered , e.g. infinitely fast diffusion , yet we do not except that this may change the major conclusions summarized above .    obviously , a very interesting direction is that of considering a protocell that is able to grow and divide .",
    "the processes involved in protocell growth and replication are indeed complex and , in particular , a necessary condition for its existence and replication is the coupling between the rates of molecules replication and cell growth .",
    "we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that the very existence of this coupling suffices to guarantee ( under very general conditions ) that , in the long run , the rate of cell division and that of duplication of the replicating molecules converge to the same value , thereby allowing sustainable growth of a population of protocells . however",
    ", those results were achieved by supposing a fixed set of genetic memory molecules , with some possible extinction .",
    "it could be sound to extend this approach to the case where there are evolving chemical reaction sets and to verify whether synchronization occurs .",
    "an important aspect to be addressed in the case of growing vesicles is also the effect of volume growth on the concentrations of the various chemicals : a preliminary investigation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "besides , we have not here explicitly considered the possibly catalytic role of membranes that , as it has been discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , might be a major cause of the difference between the intracellular environment(s ) and the bulk . in a fixed volume model this effect can be lumped in the effective reaction rates , but if we consider a growing protocell we have to take into account the differences between surfaces and volumes .",
    "this might also lead to interesting phenomena that will be analyzed in future developments .    to conclude",
    ", different protocells may host different mixtures of molecular species , even if they share the same chemistry ( i.e. , they  inhabit the same world ) .",
    "it might be extremely interesting to model the behavior of populations of different protocells of this kind , which may show different growth rates , but may also undergo phenomena like coalescence , exchange of material , etc .  thus , further investigations will be indeed necessary to assess different generations of protocell populations and their possible evolution pathways .",
    "+ last but not least , it will be interesting to extend these studies to other protocell architectures like e.g. the los alamos bug , gard models , and others .",
