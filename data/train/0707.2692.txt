    "recently , we have worked on some of the effects that general scalar - tensor theories ( stt ) of gravity yield on astrophysical scales @xcite . by taking the weak field limit of stt",
    ", three parameters appear @xcite : the newtonian constant at infinity @xmath2 , a compton length - scale ( @xmath3 ) coming from the effective mass of the lagrangian potential , and the strength of the new scalar gravitational interaction ( @xmath1 ) . for point - like",
    "masses , the new newtonian potential is of a yukawa type @xcite and , in general , analytical expressions can be found for spherical @xcite and axisymmetric systems @xcite . using these solutions",
    "we build a galactic model that is consistent with a flat rotation velocity profile which resembles the observations @xcite . in the present short contribution",
    ", we outline a way to construct such a galactic model using stt .",
    "a typical spiral galaxy consists of a disk , a bulge , and a dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "a real halo is roughly spherical in shape and contains most of the matter , up to 90% , of the system .",
    "thus , being the halo the main component , our galactic model will then consist of a spherical system of unknown dm .",
    "therefore , in order compare with observations we assume that test particles stars and dust follow dm particles . to construct our halo model",
    ", we take the weak field limit of general stt and consider a spherically symmetric fluctuation of the scalar field around some fixed background field .",
    "the stt is then characterized by a background value of the scalar field , @xmath4 , a compton lengthscale , @xmath5 , and a strength @xmath1 @xcite . for point - like sources ,",
    "the new newtonian potential is well known to be of a yukawa type @xcite : @xmath6 if one fixes the background field to be the inverse of the newtonian constant , @xmath7 , then for @xmath8 the new newtonian potential coincides with the standard newtonian one . given this , for @xmath9 one finds deviations of the order of @xmath10 to the newtonian dynamics .",
    "this setting is , however , very constrained by local ( solar system ) deviations of the newtonian force , in order for @xmath1 to be less than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can choose the setting @xmath12 and the new potential coincides with the newtonian for @xmath9 and deviates by @xmath13 for @xmath8 . if one thinks of a galactic system , physical scales are around the tens of kiloparsecs and so is our typical @xmath5 , then for distances bigger than this , one expects constrictions , e.g. from cluster dynamics or cosmology .",
    "several authors @xcite have considered these deviations , giving a rough estimate within the range of @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath15 yields an asymptotic growing factor of @xmath16 in @xmath17 , whereas the value of @xmath18 reduces @xmath17 asymptotically by one fourth .",
    "for a general density distribution the equations governing the weak energy ( newtonian limit ) of stt are @xcite : @xmath19 \\ ; , \\label{pares_eq_h00}\\\\    \\nabla^2 \\bar{\\phi } - m^2 \\bar{\\phi } & = & -   8\\pi \\alpha\\rho \\ ; , \\label{pares_eq_phibar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the scalar field fluctuation and @xmath21 is the density distribution which contains baryons , dm particles , or other types of matter . for definiteness we can think of dm , but its profile is unknown yet .",
    "this will be determined by setting the dynamics of test particles , i.e. , by demanding the new newtonian potential to be the one that solves the rotation curves of test particles stars and dust .",
    "that is , we require @xmath22 where this constant is chosen to fit rotation velocities in spirals @xcite ; this is the simplest model .",
    "we then proceed to solve for @xmath23 , and its solution is : @xmath24 substituting this result into the original system , ( [ pares_eq_h00 ] , [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) , gives @xmath25 for our convenience , we define the following densities : @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the density that the system would have to achieve flat rotation curves if system would be treated solely with newtonian physics , and @xmath29 is the contribution of the scalar field , which should be obtained by integrating the equation : @xmath30 by comparing ( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) with ( [ nablaphi ] ) , it seems natural to identify @xmath31 to convert ( [ nablaphi ] ) to a type ( [ pares_eq_phibar ] ) equation , now for @xmath32 and @xmath28 . the solution is therefore given by @xcite : @xmath33   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a length scale of the spherical system , e.g. related to the distance at which stars possess flat rotation curves ; the size of the halo is denoted by @xmath36 . once",
    "( [ pares_eq_finalphi ] ) is solved , its solution is substituted into ( [ rho_sol ] ) to find the dm distribution , @xmath37 .",
    "the procedure outlined here is straightforward .",
    "thus , using our given @xmath28 the above expression can analytically be integrated to have @xmath38   \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the dm profile becomes @xmath39   \\right\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following , we plot in figure [ all - densities ] the density profiles @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 . the main contribution to @xmath37 comes from @xmath40 , which is an inverse squared function of the radius .",
    "the dm profile is therefore cuspy near the galactic centre , similar to the nfw s obtained from simulations @xcite .",
    "we have computed the best fits to these curves for @xmath44 , given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the best fits for @xmath47 are @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in figure",
    "[ various - lambda ] we plot the dm profile for various @xmath5 values , resulting in small changes in the slope . for negative @xmath1 values , ( [ phi - bar - sol ] ) becomes negative , but the dm profile does not become shallower . we have computed the case @xmath50 , @xmath15 for @xmath44 and found @xmath51 , while for @xmath47 we obtained @xmath52 .",
    "we have constructed a spherically galactic halo model in which we fit the new gravitational potential to match a flat rotation profile for test particles stars and dust .",
    "once this is done , one computes the scalar field fluctuation and dm profiles resulting from this potential .",
    "we have found analytical results for our model , eqs.([phi - bar - sol ] ) and ( [ rho - dm - sol ] ) .",
    "these equations contain the information of the scalar field ( @xmath5 , @xmath1 ) , which determine the dm profile .",
    "we have plotted our results for @xmath53 and various @xmath5s .",
    "these profiles have an inner region as cuspy as the nfw s .",
    "negative values of @xmath1 do not yield a shallower dm profile neither .",
    "this result may however not surprise since we are not resolving the inner structure of the rotation velocity curves .",
    "we only considered its flat asymptotic behaviour ; in a forthcoming paper we will study it .",
