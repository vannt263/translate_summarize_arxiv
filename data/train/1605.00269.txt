    "models of self propelled particles in presence of non - linear velocity dependent force have been studied extensively in recent literature .",
    "we have shown earlier , if the velocity dependent force is odd under time reversal , the abps can not produce entropy unless coupled to conservative or non - conservative force  @xcite .",
    "given the self propulsion of the particles , even free abps should have produced entropy . in this paper , using an internal mechanism for generation of self propulsion , namely , in terms of an internal energy depot , we have shown , free abps of rh kind indeed produce entropy , albeit via the internal mechanism of producing self - propulsion , keeping the expression for ep in the velocity space unaltered . after integrating out the faster internal dofs ,",
    "the self propulsion turns up as non - linear velocity dependent force in abps spatial motility .",
    "we studied such coarse - grained models of abps , without explicit mechanism of self - propulsion , in the presence of a generic non - linear velocity dependent force , containing both odd and even functions of velocity .",
    "this leads to autonomous entropy production in velocity space .",
    "we have derived the expression for the total ep , independently , using the fokker - planck equation , and probability of time forward and time - reversed trajectories .",
    "both the methods led to the same result .",
    "note that the jacobians in the path probability method , corresponding to the time forward and time reversed trajectories are not the same , unlike other simpler systems  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ratio of these jacobians contributes to the dependence of ep on the even part of the velocity dependent force under time reversal .",
    "the total stochastic ep obeys fluctuation theorems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ep in the reservoir has several excess contributions in addition to the clausius entropy related to dissipated heat .",
    "this excess entropy shows two fundamentally new contributions with respect to earlier study involving force that is only an odd function of velocity  @xcite .",
    "these are : ( i )  a velocity gradient of the even function of velocity , and ( ii )  cross - coupling of the odd and even functions of velocity . using numerical simulations we have obtained probability distribution of the total ep and found good agreement with detailed fluctuation theorem .",
    "note that the observation of excess ep , does not have any conflict with thermodynamic inequality due to clausius , for systems out of equilibrium . in conclusion , each non - equilibrium dissipative mechanism not only adds to entropy independently , they often couple with each other to give rise to new terms in ep .",
