    "in recent years a lot of interest has focused on the interface area between superstring theory and cosmology .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "firstly , cosmology can provide a possible arena to test string theory observationally . secondly",
    ", superstring theory may be able to resolve the conceptual problems from which the current realizations of scalar field - driven inflation suffer ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "in particular , a lot of attention has recently been devoted to attempts to obtain periods of inflationary expansion of space in compactifications of superstring theories to four space - time dimensions .",
    "since such compactifications contain a large number of scalar fields and since some of those remain massless before supersymmetry breaking , string theory gives rise to promising candidates for the inflaton , the scalar field driving the inflationary expansion of space ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews of attempts to obtain inflation from string theory compactifications ) .",
    "d - branes have played a particularly important role in the recent approaches to obtaining inflation from string theory @xcite .",
    "a particularly promising model is the d3/d7 brane inflation model , in which the inflaton is the separation between the two branes in the directions transverse to both branes @xcite .",
    "this model features a shift symmetry @xcite for the inflaton field which ensures that at the classical level , the potential is flat along the inflaton direction ( this shift symmetry is broken under quantum corrections @xcite ) .",
    "inflation is induced by supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "various aspects of this model have been studied previously @xcite .",
    "the large number of light moduli fields in string inflation models , however , leads to a new danger : light fields which are not the inflaton are potential entropy modes and can give rise to entropy fluctuations .",
    "the `` curvaton '' @xcite and `` modulated reheating '' @xcite scenarios are examples of this effect .",
    "non - parametric generation of fluctuations from a global symmetry breaking ( also involving an key isocurvature field ) has been investigated in @xcite .    as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", these entropy modes may undergo parametric instability during the initial stages of reheating .",
    "in particular , this instability occurs on super - hubble ( but sub - horizon ) scales .",
    "this is possible @xcitesince the background fields carry the causal information to scales larger than the hubble radius .",
    "the entropy fluctuations , in turn , will seed a curvature mode ( which we will call `` secondary '' mode ) . there are two field scalar field toy models in which this secondary curvature mode dominates over the primary mode , the pure adiabatic linear perturbation theory mode .",
    "in fact @xcite the secondary mode can grow to be larger than unity before back - reaction shuts off the parametric instability which drives the growth of the entropy fluctuation . in this case , the model is ruled out by the observed ( small ) amplitude of curvature fluctuations on large cosmological scales .",
    "the d3/d7 brane inflation model is a prototypical example in which there is an entropy mode which can undergo resonance during the initial stages of reheating , the preheating @xcite phase . in this paper",
    ", we study the growth of this entropy mode and calculate the magnitude of the induced secondary curvature fluctuations .",
    "it turns out that for reasonable particle physics parameters , the secondary fluctuations remain in the linear regime at the end of the reheating phase",
    ". however , their amplitude can be ( in the absence of back - reaction effects ) larger than the amplitude of the primary mode .",
    "this would necessitate changing the parameters of the model in order to reproduce the observed magnitude of the large - scale cosmological perturbations .",
    "note that a similar conclusion was recently found @xcite in another model of brane inflation , the kklmmt model @xcite . in that model",
    ", it had already been observed that due to their large phase space enhancement , second order fluctuations may give a dominant contribution @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that the effect we are calculating in this paper is an effect which arises in linear cosmological perturbation theory . both the linear effects described here and the quadratic processes discussed in @xcite and elsewhere ( e.g. @xcite ) can be operational at the same time .",
    "in fact , the enhanced growth of the linear perturbations which is the focus of this work will increase the strength of the quadratic processes . we expect that effects similar to those discussed in @xcite will also arise in the d3/d7 system .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : we first revisit the calculation of the amplitude of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in the d3/d7 inflationary model based on the magnitude of the primary adiabatic mode alone .",
    "next , we give an approximate but analytical study of reheating in the d3/d7 brane inflation scenario .",
    "the initial stages of reheating are governed by a tachyonic decay channel .",
    "the same tachyonic resonance channel leads to exponential growth of super - hubble entropy modes , which then in turn induce a secondary curvature mode .",
    "the last major section of this paper focuses on the determination of the amplitude of this mode .",
    "our analysis of the reheating phase provides results which are interesting in their own right .",
    "a new aspects of our analysis is that we allow for an initial offset in the value of the  waterfall \" field .",
    "such an offset could arise as a consequence of the back - reaction of long wavelength fluctuations of the matter fields .",
    "such an offset will suppress the formation of domains on small scales .",
    "if the offset were sufficiently large , it could prevent the onset of the tachyonic instability .",
    "however , if we take the offset to be generated by the abovementioned fluctuations , we find that for most of the realistic space of parameters of the d3/d7 inflationary model , the resulting values of the field lie in the configuration space region for which the tachyonic resonance channel @xcite is effective .",
    "thus , the initial stages of the transfer of the energy in the inflaton field to matter fluctuations will proceed via the tachyonic instability in a time interval which is less than the characteristic time it takes for the matter fields to oscillate about their minima .",
    "a substantial part of the initial inflaton energy is converted to localized nonlinear fluctuations during the period of tachyonic resonance . neglecting the back - reaction of these fluctuations on the homogeneous background",
    ", we see that a fraction of order unity of the initial inflaton energy density still remains in the background when the tachyonic instability shuts off .",
    "we are interested in demonstrating analytically that the transfer of energy from the inflaton to fluctuations is effective in rapidly draining almost all of the energy from the homogeneous fields .",
    "the dominant energy conversion processes are those related to the interactions of the nonlinear fluctuations .",
    "these have been studied numerically in great detail in @xcite .",
    "since our aim is to demonstrate analytically that within less than a hubble time the energy can be effectively drained from the homogeneous background , we will neglect the nonlinear interactions and focus on the evolution of the homogeneous component of the fields once the tachyonic resonance shuts off ( due to our approximation scheme , we will thus only obtain an upper bound for the decay time ) .",
    "we show that the decay of the residual homogeneous component of the inflaton field occurs via a parametric resonance instability @xcite . in spite of the fact that the resonance turns out to be of narrow - band type",
    ", it leads to an efficient conversion of most of the energy from the background inflaton field to matter fluctuations .",
    "one of the advantages of the d3/d7 brane inflation model is that the matter fields are directly associated with the branes whose separation provides the inflaton field . as a consequence , there is a direct coupling between the inflaton field and the matter fields , rendering it easy , as we will see , to obtain efficient reheating .",
    "this is a feature the d3/d7 brane inflation model shares with the d4/d6 model in which reheating was analyzed in @xcite and with the brane - antibrane inflation models in which reheating was studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but contrasts with the situation in inflationary models in which the inflaton dynamics and the standard model fields live in different throats , in which case efficient reheating is more difficult to obtain ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the following section , we review the d3/d7 brane inflationary model , with particular emphasis on the form of the potential for the inflaton field . in section 3",
    "we discuss the vacuum manifold of the model , and in section 4 we revisit the calculation of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "section 5 focuses on the dynamics of the inflaton and of the other relevant scalar fields of the model before the onset of reheating , introduces the conditions for effectiveness of tachyonic resonance and demonstrates that for most of the relevant parameter space of the theory , the tachyonic resonance condition is satisfied . however , the tachyonic instability turns off before most of the energy of the inflaton field is released as matter fluctuations . to obtain an upper bound on the time it takes for the inflaton energy stored in the residual oscillations to further dissipate , we study the later dynamics of the homogeneous field components which proceeds via the less efficient parametric resonance channel ( section 6 ) .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the computation of the secondary curvature fluctuation mode , the mode induced by the entropy fluctuations .",
    "the simplest way @xcite to construct a d3/d7 inflationary model in type iib theory is to place a d3 brane ( which we take to be in the @xmath0 directions ) parallel to a d7 brane ( which is in the @xmath1 directions ) in flat space - time and break the resulting @xmath2 supersymmetry completely by switching on non - primitive gauge fluxes on the d7 brane .",
    "the bps condition is broken , and the d3 brane starts to move towards the d7 brane .",
    "the distance between the d3 brane and the d7 brane in the @xmath3 plane appears on the world - volumes of the branes as a complex scalar @xmath4 , whose value changes as the distance between the branes changes .",
    "this scalar field is identified with the inflaton , and the motion of the d3 brane towards the d7 brane is the _ slow - roll _ of hybrid inflation .",
    "once the d3 brane comes close to the d7 brane , the open string between the branes become tachyonic because of the non - primitive fluxes on the seven brane .",
    "this is the top of the hybrid inflationary scenario where one would expect a tachyonic phase transition .",
    "the d3 brane then falls onto the d7 brane and dissolves as a non - commutative instanton @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative instanton is _ not _ point - like and therefore the final configuration of a dissolved instanton is non - singular @xcite .",
    "one can also argue that in the end @xmath5 supersymmetry can be restored .",
    "this simple picture has many inherent problems .",
    "firstly , being non - compact , the gravitational solution is ten dimensional and a direct dimensional reduction will give us vanishing newton s constant in four dimensions .",
    "one way out is to compactify the other six dimensions .",
    "secondly , once we compactify , new problems have to be faced .",
    "an immediate issue that on a compact space , charge neutrality must be enforced , which requires introducing additional elements to the construction .",
    "next , the problem of moduli stabilization arises , because without stabilizing the moduli , the system will decompactify back to the ten dimensional solution via the so - called dine - seiberg runaway @xcite .",
    "thirdly , one needs to avoid an over - production of cosmic strings when the d3 dissolves in the d7 brane .",
    "ways to solve these problems were addressed in the papers @xcite where the proposal was to consider a warped solution of the form [ warped ] ds^2 = e^a(y , t ) ds^2_0123 + e^b(y , t ) g_mn",
    "dy^m dy^n , where @xmath6 are the warp factors and @xmath7 are the coordinates of the internal space . in @xcite",
    "the metric @xmath8 was chosen to be the metric of @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a combination of an orbifold and an orientifold operation ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "both the d3 and the d7 are points on the @xmath11 , and the motion of the d3 is trigerred by three form fluxes @xmath12 and @xmath13 is dualised to form gauge field on the world volume of d7 brane , this would trigger motion of the d3 brane towards d7 brane . ] .",
    "the d3 brane is oriented along @xmath14 and therefore is also a point on the k3 manifold .",
    "the d7 brane wraps the k3 and is oriented parallel to the d3 as we discussed before .",
    "supersymmetry is broken either by making [ susy ] ig g , where @xmath15 , or by switching on isd ( 1,2 ) or ( 0,3 ) forms ( recall that isd ( 1,2 ) fluxes also break susy . for more detailed analysis of this ,",
    "see the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the hodge star @xmath16 is on the internal space and gives rise to non zero supersymmetry breaking potential because of its iasd property .",
    "once supersymmetry is broken , there would be non - trivial potential between the branes .",
    "the complete picture can be worked out easily from the low energy type iib supergravity lagrangian in the presence of d - brane sources in the following way ( see also @xcite ) : [ comlag ] & & s= d^10x + + & & + t_3 d^4 x + non  perturbative  terms where the dotted terms involve axio - dilaton plus other higher form interactions , @xmath17 is a constant and @xmath18 with @xmath19 . where @xmath20 is the gauge field on the d3 brane , @xmath21 is the gauge field on the d7 brane , and ( @xmath22 ) are the corresponding scalars on these branes . for more details see @xcite .    the first term in eqn .",
    "when reduced to four dimensions give rise to the kinetic terms for the complex and khler structure moduli .",
    "the second term is the potential term for the moduli : [ secterm ] d^6 x e^k(|dw|^2 - 3|w^2| ) and therefore fixes ( at least ) all the complex structure moduli and the axio - dilaton ( the @xmath23 term goes away for the no - scale models ) .    the second line in eqn .",
    "is related to the kinetic terms for the gauge fields on the d - branes and the inflaton @xmath4 ( if we ignore the scalar @xmath24 ) .",
    "the other scalar doublet @xmath25 denote the hypermultiplet scalars with the corresponding d - term and f - term potentials being given in the third and the fourth lines of eqn . .",
    "the potential @xmath26 , whose value will be specified later , denotes the additional attractive potential between the d3 and the d7 brane .",
    "finally , the non - perturbative potentials stabilize the remaining khler structure moduli .",
    "the above picture is _ almost _ complete except for an important subtlety .",
    "the potential that fixes the complex structure moduli in eqn . also gives a large mass to the inflaton field @xmath4 because the khler potential @xmath27 in eqn .",
    "picks up a dependence on the inflaton @xcite .",
    "the potential for the inflaton then becomes very steep and consequently do not allow slow roll to happen in generic models . in the d3/d7 model",
    "this could be avoided ( at least at the tree level ) by allowing a shift symmetry , but this symmetry is broken by the @xmath26 term in .",
    "thus a generic model of inflation from string theory is very complicated ( see @xcite for some recent developments ) and since our aim here is to make the first step in understanding structure formation and reheating after inflation , we will ignore the subtleties associated with moduli stabilization .",
    "therefore , from the analysis presented above in eqn . we will only concentrate on the f - term and d - term potentials for the hypermultiplet scalars ( which we will henceforth label as @xmath28 and @xmath29 instead of the complex doublet @xmath25 ) and the inflaton @xmath4 , and assume that the contributions from the background fluxes given in eqn . and the non - perturbative contributions fix most of the moduli .",
    "note however that , as we mentioned earlier , there are other contributions to the inflaton potential coming from the khler potential @xmath27 in . for the simple analysis that we present here , we will ignore this contribution .",
    "more details on this will appear elsewhere .",
    "looking from the d3 point of view , the complex scalar @xmath4 that parametrises the @xmath30 , and a set of complex scalars @xmath28 and @xmath29 arising from the hypermultiplet - string between the branes give rise to the following potential : [ pot1 ] & & v(s , _ + , _ - ) = 2 g^2 |s|^2 ( |_+|^2 + |_-|^2 ) + & & + 2 g^2 | _ + _ - - _ + 2|^2 + g^2 2 ( |_+|^2 - |_-|^2 - _ 3 ) ^2 plus the additional @xmath26 term that we will add later .",
    "here we have taken a more generic case by switching on @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the fi terms to break susy .",
    "there is also another subtlety related to the issue of moduli stabilization that we should mention now . due to background ns and rr fields",
    ", one might expect that all the complex structure moduli should be naturally fixed via a gvw potential @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but our background is time - dependent , so the issue of fixing moduli should be addressed at any _ given _ time .",
    "similarly , one might also expect that the supergravity no - scale structure will be broken by allowing a gaugino condensate along the lines of @xcite .",
    "these problems are not yet solved in a time dependent background , and an attempt to address these issues along the lines of @xcite is under way ( see also @xcite for another recent study of moduli corrections to d - term inflation ) .    finally , the issue of cosmic strings can be addressed by going to the full non - perturbative f - theory picture of the d3/d7 system ( see @xcite and the second paper of @xcite ) . from f",
    "- theory it is easy to generate _",
    "symmetries , and an @xmath33 global symmetry can convert the cosmic strings to semi - local strings of achucarro - vachaspati @xcite type ( see also @xcite ) . in terms of the d3/d7 system , this is simply a doubling of the number of d7 branes .",
    "these semi - local strings reduce the severity of the problems generated by cosmic strings @xcite ( they do not completely eliminate the problems , as a recent study @xcite has shown ) .",
    "from the previous section , we see that the potential which describes the dynamics of the complex inflaton field @xmath4 ( the separation of the two branes in the 4 - 5 plane ) and of the two complex scalar fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 associated with the lowest energy modes of the strings stretching between the branes is given by ( [ pot1 ] ) .",
    "the vacuum manifold @xmath34 is the set of field configurations which minimize the potential .",
    "the potential has been normalized such that the minimal value of the potential is @xmath35 .",
    "to be at the minimum of the potential , the inflaton field must have relaxed to @xmath36 .",
    "a special case which we will focus most of our attention on is the case @xmath37 with @xmath38 . introducing radial and angular coordinates with each @xmath39 field : _ + & = & _ + e^i_+ + _ - & = & _ - e^i_- we see that the conditions to have @xmath35 become _ + _ - & = & 0 + _",

    "the vacuum manifold @xmath34 is given by : _",

    "it is the @xmath40 manifold discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are no non - compact flat directions .",
    "another interesting special case occurs if @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in this case , setting the potential to zero yields the conditions |_+|^2 - |_-|^2 & = & 0 +    given by : _",
    "+ = _ - = , _ + = - _ - .",

    "+ ^2 & = & _ 3 2 + 1 2 + _ + & = & - _ - . in the following",
    ", we will focus mostly on the special case @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we will review the calculation of the amplitude of the primary adiabatic perturbations .",
    "this is the mode which is usually considered in the literature and which is used to fix the model parameters . in section 7",
    "we will turn to a discussion of the entropy mode .    in the d3/d7 brane inflation scenario , inflation takes place while the branes are widely separated , i.e. while @xmath43 is large . from ( [ pot1 ] )",
    "it follows immediately that for large values of the inflaton , the scalar fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 will vanish at the classical level ( their quantum fluctuations will play an important role in the following section ) .    before turning on any supersymmetry breaking , and even after introducing the supersymmetry - breaking parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the tree level , the configuration of branes is bps",
    ", there is no force between the branes , and @xmath4 will remain constant .",
    "one loop supersymmetry breaking terms will result in an additional one - loop contribution @xmath26 to the potential [ pot2 ] v = g^4 _ 3 ^ 2  ln(|s|^2 ) . in the language of supersymmetric effective field theory",
    ", this term corresponds to d - term supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we are omitting the quartic contribution to the symmetry breaking potential which corresponds to f - term supersymmetry breaking . in the language of d3/d7 system , the above potential appears naturally from the supergravity solution of a d3-brane separated from a d7-brane by a radial distance @xmath44 as @xcite : [ sugrapot ] v arctan^2  f_-  ln  ( r^2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath45 is related to the d7 brane gauge fluxes . therefore the identification of @xmath32 with some components of the gauge fluxes on the d7 brane is consistent with expectation .",
    "we also see that @xmath46 in ( [ pot2 ] ) is related to the string scale @xmath47 in ( [ sugrapot ] ) .    for small values of the string coupling constant @xmath48 , this extra term in the potential will lead to a slow rolling of the inflaton field @xmath4 towards @xmath36 .",
    "initially , the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 will vanish .",
    "note that the presence of ( [ pot2 ] ) lifts the flat direction , preferring the value @xmath49 . for a sufficiently small value of @xmath4",
    ", a tachyonic instability of the field @xmath28 will set in .",
    "the critical value @xmath50 below which this instability appears is given by [ dis ] s_t = , the condition coming from setting the second derivative of the potential ( [ pot1 ] ) to zero at @xmath51 . from direct open string calculation",
    "this is given by [ dis2 ] s_t = .",
    "again we see that the identification of @xmath32 with some components of the gauge fluxes on the d7 brane is consistent with expectation .",
    "since there is no instability in the @xmath29 direction , @xmath29 will remain zero , again modulo quantum uncertainties which may become important during the later stages of preheating",
    ". we will therefore , for the moment , set @xmath49 and consider the dynamics of the reduced configuration space consisting of the inflaton and @xmath28 .",
    "the inflationary scenario realized here is a specific case of hybrid inflation @xcite , and more precisely of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . whereas it is the field @xmath4 which is slowly rolling and producing the density fluctuations , it is the potential energy of the field @xmath28 which generates inflation .",
    "fluctuations in general hybrid inflation models have been studied before ( see , in particular , @xcite ) .    using the standard theory of cosmological perturbations in inflationary cosmology",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for comprehensive review articles and @xcite for a pedagogical introduction ) we obtain as amplitude @xmath52 of the spectrum of scalar metric fluctuations [ amp1 ] _ h 1 v^3/2 , where @xmath53 is the reduced planck mass . in terms of the d3/d7 model ,",
    "this could be derived from the fluctuation of the background metric when the d3 brane moves towards the d7 brane .",
    "now , making use of ( [ pot1 ] ) and ( [ pot2 ] ) we obtain ( see also @xcite ) [ amp2 ] _ h 4 _ 3 s .",
    "this is to be evaluated at the value of the inflaton @xmath4 ( we will from now on omit the absolute value sign for this field ) when modes which are being observed today on large scales exit the hubble radius during the period of inflation . for high scale inflation",
    "this happens @xmath54 hubble expansion times before the tachyonic instability develops , at a value @xmath55 .",
    "assuming that the acceleration of @xmath4 during inflation is negligible , then @xmath56 is given by [ svalue ] s_n^2 = s_t^2 + n g^2 m_pl^2 , where @xmath57 is evaluated at @xmath58 ( we solve the scalar field equation of motion working backwards in time assuming constant @xmath57 to obtain )",
    ".    provided that [ ineq ] n g^2 ( m_pl ) ^2 < 1 , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ svalue ] ) is smaller than the first . in this case , ( [ amp2 ] ) yields [ amp4 ] _ h 2 1 g _ 3 ^ 3/2 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inequality in ( [ ineq ] ) is reversed , then the result becomes [ amp5 ] _ h 2 .",
    "the cosmological evolution starts with a separation between the branes which is large on string scale . at large values of @xmath43 , the coupling between @xmath4 and the string fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 constrains the latter to be zero , modulo classical and quantum fluctuations .    neglecting the classical and quantum fluctuations of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the cosmological evolution is as follows : the inflaton field @xmath4 rolls down the  valley \" of its potential until a tachyonic instability for @xmath28 sets in .",
    "this occurs at the value @xmath50 given by ( [ dis ] ) . at that point",
    ", the evolution will take place in the complex two - dimensional field space of @xmath4 and @xmath28 .",
    "there is no instability in @xmath29 direction , and hence @xmath29 will remain zero . at the background level , the term proportional to @xmath59 induces a linear confining potential for @xmath29 .",
    "let us now focus on the potential in @xmath28 direction for a fixed value of @xmath4 .",
    "this potential has a negative effective mass ( i.e. a tachyonic instability ) for small values of @xmath60 only . for larger values ,",
    "the effective square mass is positive , leading to oscillations about the minimum of the potential .",
    "the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath28 do not play an important role in most of our considerations , and hence we will set them to zero in the following unless indicated otherwise .",
    "this will simplify the notation .",
    "we will briefly return to the issue of these phases in the concluding section .",
    "a new aspect of our work is the inclusion of the possibility that the @xmath28 field has an offset from the symmetric point @xmath51 at the end of the period of inflation .",
    "such an offset in any given hubble patch will in general be produced by the fluctuations of the field on super - hubble scales @xcite .",
    "the offset will suppress the ability of small - scale quantum vacuum fluctuations of @xmath28 to produce topological or non - topological defects on small length scales at the beginning of the resonance process .",
    "such defect formation and the subsequent non - linear interaction of the defects was seen in previous work @xcite to be the most important aspect of reheating in hybrid - type inflation models like the one we are considering . in our analytical study of reheating , we will assume that the effect of the small - scale vacuum fluctuations is sub - dominant compared to the effect of the offset .",
    "even if the small - scale fluctuations dominate the reheating dynamics , they will unlikely influence the evolution of the large - scale metric fluctuations which is the focus of most of our interest .",
    "the first question to ask concerning the effects of the offset is whether it can prevent the onset of the `` tachyonic '' ( or `` negative coupling '' ) @xcite resonance . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we will assume that the offset is generated by the long wavelength fluctuations of @xmath28 which were generated during the period of slow - roll inflation and check to see if they are sufficiently small such that , when @xmath4 reaches the onset of the instability , @xmath28 will in fact be in the region of tachyonic evolution .",
    "if this is the case then , as discussed in @xcite , the energy transfer from the coherently evolving fields to matter fluctuations ( the  preheating \" phase of the reheating process ) will be very rapid and complete before oscillations of @xmath28 and @xmath4 can set in .",
    "if , on the other hand , the fluctuations of @xmath28 are sufficiently large , then there will be no tachyonic preheating phase , and the energy transfer from the inflaton to the matter fields will proceed by the parametric instability channel first discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and discussed comprehensively in @xcite .    before estimating the magnitude of the fluctuations of @xmath28 , we note that the slow rolling of the inflaton field @xmath4 will prevent the onset of the instability of @xmath28 until [ endslow ] |v | |v | .",
    "before this condition is satisfied , the evolution of the dynamical system in the @xmath61 plane corresponds to a horizontal straight line ( the solid curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "sketch of the evolution of the fields @xmath4 and @xmath28 in configuration space .",
    "the solid line represents the evolution of the background fields .",
    "the cosmological evolution begins in the region of slow - roll ( to the right and below the dashed curve ) .",
    "the slow - rolling ends when the dashed line is reached , after which a period of quasi - periodic oscillations about the ground state @xmath36 and @xmath62 sets in .",

    "we recall that for @xmath49 , the potential of our model reduces to that of supersymmetric hybrid inflation .",
    "reheating in hybrid inflation was first studied in @xcite , and then in greater depth in @xcite where , in particular , the tachyonic instability channel was investigated .",

    "<S> we study the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations in the d3/d7 brane inflationary universe with particular attention to the parametric excitation of entropy modes during the reheating stage . the same tachyonic instability which renders reheating in this model very rapid leads to an exponential growth of entropy fluctuations during the preheating stage which in turn may induce a large contribution to the large - scale curvature fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the effects of long wavelength quantum fluctuations in the matter fields . as part of this work , </S>",
    "<S> we perform an analytical analysis of the reheating process . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the initial stage of preheating proceeds by the tachyonic instability channel . </S>",
    "<S> an upper bound on the time it takes for the energy initially stored in the inflaton field to convert into fluctuations is obtained by neglecting the local fluctuations produced during the period of tachyonic decay and analyzing the decay of the residual homogeneous field oscillations , which proceeds by parametric resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in spite of the fact that the resonance is of narrow - band type , it is sufficiently efficient to rapidly convert most of the energy of the background fields into matter fluctuations . </S>"
