    "the norm on @xmath37 dual to the @xmath42-norm on @xmath22 will also be called @xmath42-norm , and will be denoted by the same symbol .",
    "the original motivation for this article was to compare the stable norm and the @xmath42-norm .",
    "this is done in section [ comparison ] , and our result is :    [ compa1 ] let    * @xmath52 be a closed , oriented surface equipped with a riemannian metric * @xmath53 be the total volume of @xmath52 .    then for all @xmath54",
    ", we have @xmath55    this theorem was originally proved as equation ( 4.8 ) of @xcite , see also @xcite . in section [ section compa ] we give a short and simple proof .",

    "is it realized by some surfaces , and if so , how to characterize such surfaces ?",
    "such as it is , question [ question 1 ] is readily answered by @xcite , and the answer is that @xmath57 if and only if @xmath0 is the two - torus and the metric @xmath2 is flat .",
    "the `` if '' part may be checked by elementary calculations and we leave it as an exercise .",
    "the `` only if '' holds because , by @xcite , if the stable norm and the @xmath42-norm are proportional , then each harmonic 1-form has constant norm",
    ". then proposition 6.2 of @xcite implies that @xmath52 is a flat torus .",
    "this answer to question [ question 1 ] prompts new questions :    [ question 2 ] if we fix a genus @xmath58 for @xmath0 , what is the optimal lower bound ?",
    "is it realized by some riemannian metrics ?",
    "if so , are those metrics of constant curvature ?    another obvious question is    [ question 3 ] does @xmath40 have an upper bound involving known geometric quantities such as the length of a homological systole ( the length of a shortest , non - separating closed geodesic ) ?",
    "the best we can do about questions [ question 2 ] , [ question 3 ] is summed up in corollary [ bounds in arbitrary curvature ] which we restate here for the commodity of the reader :    let    * @xmath0 be a closed , oriented surface of genus @xmath59 * @xmath2 be a riemannian metric on @xmath0 * @xmath60 be the diameter of @xmath52 * @xmath61 be the length of a homological systole of @xmath52",

    "then there exist positive numbers @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which depend only on the genus @xmath27 of @xmath0 , such that when @xmath64 is small enough , @xmath67    it would be interesting to know if there is a more precise asymptotic estimate for the behaviour of @xmath40 when @xmath2 tends to infinity in the moduli space @xmath68 of surfaces of genus @xmath27 and curvature @xmath63 . at least we know that @xmath40 does not have a maximum in @xmath68 , but the following question remains :    does @xmath40 have a minimum when @xmath52 ranges over the moduli space @xmath68 of surfaces of genus @xmath27 ?",
    "if so , which surfaces realize the minimum ?",
    "there is still an obvious question that we havent addressed :    given a surface @xmath52 , by which homology classes is @xmath40 realized , as the maximum in equation ( [ def k ] ) ? when is it realized by ( the homology classes of ) simple closed geodesics ?    in the case of flat tori , it can be checked by elementary calculations that for almost every flat torus ( with respect to lebesgue measure on the moduli space of flat tori ) , @xmath40 is not realized by the homology classes of simple closed geodesics . in the case of surfaces of constant negative curvature , we propose the following conjecture , inspired by theorem 10.7 of @xcite :    for any @xmath69 , for almost every @xmath52 in @xmath68 , @xmath40 is realized by the homology classes of simple closed geodesics .",
