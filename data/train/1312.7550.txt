    "the elements that are pertinent to life on earth are generated in the big bang and in stars through the fusion of protons , neutrons and nuclei . in big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , alpha particles ( @xmath0he nuclei ) and some heavier elements",
    "are generated .",
    "life essential elements like @xmath1c and @xmath2o are generated in hot , old stars , where the so - called triple - alpha reaction plays an important role . here",
    ", two alphas fuse to produce the instable , but long - lived @xmath3be nucleus . as the density of @xmath0he nuclei in such stars is high , a third alpha fuses with this nucleus before it decays .",
    "however , to generate a sufficient amount of @xmath1c and @xmath2o , an excited state in @xmath1c at an excitation energy of 7.65  mev with spin zero and positive parity is required as pointed out by hoyle long ago @xcite . in a further step ,",
    "carbon is turned into oxygen without such a resonant condition .",
    "so we are faced with a multitude of fine - tunings which need to be explained .",
    "we know that all strongly interacting composites like hadrons and nuclei must emerge from the underlying gauge theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , that is formulated in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "these fundamental matter and force fields are , however , confined .",
    "further , the mass of the light quarks relevant for nuclear physics is very small and thus plays little role in the total mass of nucleons and nuclei .",
    "finally , protons and neutrons form nuclei .",
    "this requires the inclusion of electromagnetism , characterized by the fine - structure constant @xmath4 .",
    "so the question we want to address in the following is : how sensitive are these strongly interacting composites to variations in the fundamental parameters of qcd+qed ? or stated differently :",
    "how accidental is life on earth ?",
    "nuclear forces are best described by utilizing chiral effective field theory ( eft ) as pioneered by weinberg @xcite .",
    "the forces between two , three and four nucleons are given by pion - exchange contributions and short - distance multi - nucleon operators , the latter being accompanied by low - energy constants that must be determined by a fit to data . for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite@xmath5 . in this scheme ,",
    "the quark mass dependence of the forces is generated explicitely ( pion propagator ) and implicitly ( pion - nucleon coupling , nucleon mass , 4n couplings ) , see fig.[fig : mpi ] .    throughout , we use the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation , @xmath6 , so one can use pion and quark mass dependence synonymously . for any observable @xmath7 of a hadron @xmath8 , we can define its quark mass dependence in terms of the so - called @xmath9-factor , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the corresponding quark mass . the pion mass dependence of pion and nucleon properties can be obtained from lattice qcd combined with chiral perturbation theory as detailed in ref.@xcite@xmath5 .",
    "the pertinent results are : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the average light quark mass . for the quark mass dependence of the short - distance terms",
    ", one has to resort to modeling using resonance saturation@xcite .",
    "this induces a sizeable uncertainty that might be overcome by lattice simulations in the future . for the nn scattering lengths",
    ", this leads to @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( with be denoting the binding energy ) , extending and improving earlier work based on efts and models@xcite .",
    "the running of the nn scattering lengths and the deuteron be with the light quark mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : run ] .",
    "in addition to shifts in @xmath20 , we shall also consider the effects of shifts in @xmath21 .",
    "the treatment of the coulomb interaction in the nuclear lattice eft framework is described in detail in ref .",
    "with the results from the previous section , one can now analyze what constraints the element abundances in bbn on possible quark mass variations imply . to answer this question",
    ", we also need the variation of @xmath22he and @xmath0he with the pion mass . following ref .",
    "@xcite ( blp ) , these can be obtained by convoluting the 2n @xmath9-factors with the variation of the 3- and 4-particle bes with respect to the singlet and triplet nn scattering lengths .",
    "this gives @xmath23 and @xmath24@xcite , which is consistent with a direct calculation using nuclear lattice simulations , @xmath25 and @xmath26@xcite . with this input",
    ", we can calculate the bbn response matrix of the primordial abundances @xmath27 at fixed baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the relevant bes for @xmath30h , @xmath22h , @xmath22he , @xmath0he , @xmath31li , @xmath32li and @xmath32be and the singlet nn scattering length , using the updated kawano code ( for details , see ref.@xcite ) . combining the calculated with the observed abundances",
    ", one finds that the most stringent limits arise from the deuteron abundance [ deut / h ] and the @xmath0he abundance normalized to the one of protons , @xmath0he(@xmath33 ) , as most neutrons end up in the alpha nucleus . combining these leads to the constraint @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to most earlier determinations , we provide reliable error estimates due to the underlying eft . however , as pointed out by blp , one can obtain an even stronger bound due to the neutron lifetime , which strongly affects @xmath0he(@xmath33 ) .",
    "we have re - evaluated this constraint under the model - independent assumption that _ all _ quark and lepton masses vary with the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath35 , leading to @xmath36",
    "i now turn to the central topic of this talk , namely how fine - tuned is the production of carbon and oxygen with respect to changes in the fundamental parameters of qcd+qed ? or , stated differently , how much can we detune these parameters from their physical values to still have an habitable earth as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fate ] . to be more precise",
    ", we must specify which parameters we can vary . in qcd",
    ", the strong coupling constant is tied to the nucleon mass through dimensional transmutation .",
    "however , the light quark mass ( here , only the strong isospin limit is relevant ) is an external parameter .",
    "naively , one could argue that due to the small contribution of the quark masses to the proton and the neutron mass , one could allow for sizeable variations .",
    "however , the relevant scale to be compared to here is the average binding energy per nucleon , @xmath37mev ( which is much smaller than the nucleon mass ) .    as noted before , the coulomb repulsion between protons is an important ingredient in nuclear binding",
    ", therefore we must also consider changes in @xmath38 .",
    "the tool to do this are nuclear lattice simulations , which allowed e.g. for the first _ ab initio _ calculation of the hoyle state@xcite .",
    "let us consider first qcd ( for details , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "we want to calculate the variations of the pertinent energy differences in the triple - alpha process @xmath39 , which according to fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] boils down to ( we consider small variations around the physical value of the pion mass @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 with the definitions @xmath42 with @xmath43 the pion mass appearing in the pion - exchange potentials the various derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ eeq2 ] ) can be obtained precisely using auxiliary field quantum monte carlo techniques and the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are related to the pion and nucleon @xmath9-factors determined in sec .",
    "[ sec : forces ] .",
    "the scheme - dependent quantities @xmath46 can be traded for the pion - mass dependence of the inverse singlet and triplet scattering lengths , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "we can then express all energy differences appearing in the triple - alpha process ( @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the energies of the ground states of @xmath52he and @xmath53be , respectively , and @xmath54 denotes the energy of the hoyle state ) as functions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "one finds that all these energy differences are correlated , i.e. the various fine - tunings in the triple - alpha process are not independent of each others , see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] .",
    "further , one finds a strong dependence on the variations of the @xmath0he be , which is strongly suggestive of the @xmath57-cluster structure of the @xmath3be , @xmath1c and hoyle states .",
    "such correlations related to the production of carbon have indeed been speculated upon earlier  @xcite .",
    "consider now the reaction rate of the triple - alpha process as given by @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the @xmath57-particle number density in the stellar plasma with temperature @xmath60 , @xmath61 the radiative width of the hoyle state and @xmath62 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the stellar modeling calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that sufficient abundances of both carbon and oxygen can be maintained within an envelope of @xmath63  kev around the empirical value of @xmath64  kev .",
    "this condition can be turned into a constraint on shifts in @xmath20 that reads ( for more details , see ref.@xcite ) @xmath65   % \\times \\left(\\frac{\\delta m_q^{}}{m_q^ { } } \\right ) \\right|   < 0.15\\%~. \\label{final_res}\\ ] ] the resulting constraints on the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 compatible with the condition @xmath68  kev are visualized in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] .",
    "the various shaded bands in this figure cover the values of @xmath69 and @xmath67 consistent with carbon - oxygen based life , when @xmath20 is varied by @xmath70% , @xmath71% and @xmath72% .",
    "given the current theoretical uncertainty in @xmath69 and @xmath67 , our results remain compatible with a vanishing @xmath73 , in other words with a complete lack of fine - tuning .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] ( right panel ) also indicates that the triple - alpha process is unlikely to be fine - tuned to a higher degree than @xmath74% under variation of @xmath20 .",
    "the central values of @xmath69 and @xmath67 from ref.@xcite suggest that variations in the light quark masses of up to @xmath75% are unlikely to be catastrophic to the formation of life - essential carbon and oxygen .",
    "a similar calculation of the tolerance for shifts in the fine - structure constant @xmath21 suggests that carbon - oxygen based life can withstand shifts of @xmath76% in @xmath21 .",
    "the hoyle state dramatically increases the reaction rate of the triple - alpha process .",
    "the resulting enhancement is also sensitive to the exact value of @xmath77 , which is therefore the principal control parameter of this reaction .",
    "as the hoyle state is crucial to the formation of elements essential to life as we know it , this state has been nicknamed the `` level of life ''  @xcite .",
    "thus , the hoyle state is often viewed as a prime manifestation of the anthropic principle , which states that the observable values of the fundamental physical and cosmological parameters are restricted by the requirement that life can form to determine them , and that the universe be old enough for that to occur  @xcite .",
    "see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough historical discussion of the hoyle state in view of the anthropic principle .",
    "we remark that in the context of cosmology and string theory , the anthropic principle and its consequences have had a significant influence , as reviewed recently in @xcite . as noted already in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the allowed variations in @xmath77 are not that small , as @xmath78 still allows for carbon - oxygen based life .",
    "so one might argue that the anthropic principle is indeed _ not _ needed to explain the fine - tunings in the triple - alpha process .",
    "however , as we just showed , this translates into allowed quark mass variations of @xmath79 and modifications of the fine - structure constant of about 2.5% .",
    "the fine - tuning in the fundamental parameters is thus much more severe than the one in the energy difference @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , beyond such relatively small changes in the fundamental parameters , the anthropic principle indeed appears necessary to explain the observed abundances of @xmath1c and @xmath2o .",
    "in this talk , i have summarized recent developments in our understanding of the fine - tuning in the generation of the life - essential elements as well as the light elements generated in bbn . as shown ,",
    "the allowed parameter variations in qcd+qed are small , giving some credit to the anthropic principle . to sharpen these conclusions ,",
    "future work is required .",
    "on one side , lattice qcd at sufficiently small quark masses will eventually be able to give tighter constraints on the parameters @xmath80 and on the other side , nuclear lattice simulations have to be made more precise to reduce the theoretical error in the binding and excitation energies and to provide _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear reactions , for first steps , see refs.@xcite@xmath5 .",
