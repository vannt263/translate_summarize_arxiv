    "a complete picture of inclusive @xmath2 decay is beginning to emerge from recent measurements by cleo  ii and the lep experiments .",
    "these measurements can be used to address the question of whether the hadronic decay of the b meson is compatible with its semileptonic branching fraction .",
    "three facts emerge from the experimental examination of inclusive @xmath2 decay : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of charm quarks produced per @xmath2 decay taking an average of argus , cleo 1.5 , and cleo ii results and using @xmath5@xcite .",
    "@xmath6 this value is the average of the cleo and argus model independent measurements using dileptons .",
    "the third quantity is calculated from the inclusive @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 branching fractions , @xmath10 this value is determined assuming no contribution from @xmath11 decays , an assumption which can be checked using data .      in the usual parton model ,",
    "it is difficult to accomodate a low semileptonic branching fraction unless the hadronic width of the b meson is increased.@xcite    the explanations for the semileptonic branching fraction which have been proposed can be formulated by expressing the hadronic width of the @xmath2 meson in terms of three components : @xmath12 if the semileptonic branching fraction is to be reduced to the observed level , then one of these components must be enhanced .    a large number of explanations have been proposed in the last few years .",
    "these explanations can be logically classified as follows :    1 .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath13 due to large qcd corrections or the breakdown of local duality@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath14 due to non - perturbative effects @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath15 or @xmath16 from new physics@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the cocktail solution : for example , if both the @xmath13 and the @xmath17 mechanisms are increased , this could suffice to explain the inclusive observations . 5 .",
    "there might also be a systematic experimental problem in the determination of either @xmath4 , @xmath18 , or @xmath19@xcite .",
    "inclusive charm particle - lepton correlations can be used to probe the @xmath2 decay mechanism and give further insight into this problem .",
    "high momentum leptons are used @xmath20 gev to tag the flavor of the b. the angular correlation between the meson and the lepton is then employed to select events in which the tagging lepton and meson are from different @xmath2s . when the lepton and meson originate from the same b meson they tend to be back to back , whereas when the meson and leptons come from different b mesons they are uncorrelated . after this separation",
    "is performed , wrong sign correlations from @xmath21 mixing must be subtracted .",
    "since the mixing rate is well measured , this correction is straightforward and has little uncertainty .",
    "this technique has been applied previously to several types of correlations of charmed hadrons and leptons .",
    "for example , the sign of @xmath22-lepton correlations distinguishes between the @xmath14 and the @xmath13 mechanisms .",
    "it was found that the @xmath23 mechanism comprises @xmath24 of @xmath25 decays@xcite .",
    "similiarly , examination of @xmath26-lepton correlations shows that most @xmath26 mesons originate from @xmath13 rather than from @xmath14 with @xmath27 quark popping at the lower vertex . in this case , it was found that @xmath28 of the @xmath26 mesons originate from the latter mechanism@xcite .",
    "the same experimental technique has now been applied to @xmath29-lepton correlations .",
    "the conventional @xmath17 mechanism which was _ previously assumed _ to be responsible for all @xmath29 production in @xmath2 decay will give @xmath30 correlations . if a significant fraction of @xmath29 mesons arise from @xmath23 with light quark popping at the upper vertex .",
    "this new mechanism proposed by buchalla , dunietz , and yamamoto will give @xmath31 correlations@xcite .",
    "preliminary results of this study have been presented by cleo  ii which finds , @xmath32.@xcite this implies a new contribution to the @xmath13 width @xmath33 aleph finds evidence for @xmath34 decays with a substantial branching fraction of @xmath35@xcite .",
    "delphi reports the observation of @xmath36 decays with a branching fraction of @xmath37@xcite,@xcite .",
    "since cleo has set upper limits on the cabibbo suppressed exclusive decay modes @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the @xmath40 range,@xcite this implies that the signals observed by aleph and delphi involve the production of a pair of @xmath29 mesons and additional particles .",
    "the rate observed by aleph is consistent with the rate of wrong sign @xmath29-lepton correlation reported by cleo .",
    "it is possible that these channels are actually resonant modes of the form @xmath41 decays , where the p - wave @xmath42 or radially excited @xmath43 decays to @xmath44@xcite",
    ".    we can now recalculate @xmath45 which would suggest a larger charm yield ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this supports hypothesis ( 1 ) , large qcd corrections in @xmath13 . _ but the charm yield @xmath4 as computed in the usual way is unchanged_. the contribution of @xmath47 was properly accounted for in the computation of @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that the experimental situation is still problematic .",
    "is there an error in the normalization @xmath48 ? or is there still room for enhanced @xmath49 ?",
    "we note that aleph and opal have recently reported a value for @xmath4 in @xmath50 decay@xcite,@xcite .",
    "aleph finds @xmath51 .",
    "the rate of @xmath26 and @xmath22 production is significantly higher than what is observed at the @xmath52 .",
    "it is not clear whether the quantity being measured is the same as @xmath4 at the @xmath52 , which would be the case if the spectator model holds and if the contribution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 could be neglected .",
    "opal reports a somewhat lower value of @xmath55 after correcting for unseen charmonium states .",
    "opal assumes no contribution from @xmath56 production while aleph includes a large contribution from this source .",
    "the contribution of @xmath57baryon decays to charm counting as well as the @xmath22 , @xmath58 branching fraction scales are still poorly understood and merit further investigation .",
    "there are other implications of these observations . a @xmath2 decay mechanism with a @xmath59 branching fraction has been found which was not previously included in the cleo or lep monte carlo simulations of @xmath2 decay .",
    "this may have consequences for other analyses of particle - lepton correlations .",
    "for example , cleo has re - examined the model independent dilepton measurement of @xmath60 . due to the lepton threshold of 0.6 gev and the soft spectrum of leptons ,",
    "the cleo measurement is fortuitously unchanged .",
    "it is also important to check the size of this effect in lep measurements of the @xmath2 semileptonic branching fraction using dileptons .",
    "the sign and magnitude of the color suppressed amplitude can be determined using several classes of decay modes in charm and bottom mesons .",
    "the numerical determination assumes factorization and uses form factors from various phenemonological models .    for @xmath29 decay",
    "one uses exclusive modes such as @xmath61 , @xmath62 etc . , and obtains @xmath63 the destructive interference observed in two body @xmath64 decays leads to the @xmath64-@xmath65 lifetime difference .    for @xmath2 decay",
    ", one can find the magnitude of @xmath66 from the branching fractions for the decay modes @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath69 .",
    "one can also extract @xmath66 from measurements of branching fractions @xmath70 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath71 can be determined from the branching fractions for @xmath72 .",
    "this yields @xmath73 .",
    "3.5 truein    the value of @xmath74 can be found by comparing @xmath75 decays where both the external and spectator diagrams contribute to @xmath76 decays where only the external spectator decays contribute .",
    "for example , the model of neubert et al . predicts the following ratios : @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80    using the latest branching fractions , we find @xmath81 where the second error is due to the uncertainty ( @xmath82 ) in the relative production of @xmath83 and @xmath84 mesons at the @xmath52 .",
    "there are a number of uncertainties which could significantly modify the magnitude of @xmath74 .",
    "for example , the ratios of some heavy - to - heavy to heavy - to - light form factors is needed ( e.g. @xmath85 ) .",
    "an estimate of this uncertainty is given by comparing the value of @xmath74 determined using form factors from the model of neubert et al . with",
    "the value obtained using form factors from the model of deandrea _",
    "et al._. we also note the effect of including the @xmath86 mode for which the form factors have somewhat larger theoretical uncertainties .",
    "it is important to remember that this determination also assumes the factorization hypothesis . from fig .",
    "[ a2a1 ] it is clear that the large error on the relative production of @xmath83 and @xmath84 mesons is the most significant uncertainty in the determination of @xmath74 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ a2a1 ] this is consistent with the ratio @xmath71/@xmath66 where @xmath71 is computed from @xmath87 modes and @xmath66 is computed from @xmath88 modes .",
    "although the result is surprisingly different from what is observed in hadronic charm decay ( see fig .",
    "[ a2a1_charm ] ) and from what is expected in the @xmath89 expansion , buras claims that the result can be accomodated in nlo qcd calculations@xcite .",
    "if the constructive interference which is observed in these @xmath83 decays is present in all @xmath83 decays , then we expect a significant @xmath83-@xmath84 lifetime difference ( @xmath90 ) , of order @xmath91 .",
    "this is only marginally consistent with experimental measurements of lifetimes ; the world average computed in our review@xcite is @xmath92    3.5 truein    it is possible that the hadronic @xmath83 decays that have been observed to date are atypical .",
    "the remaining higher multiplicity @xmath83 decays could have destructive interference or no interference . or perhaps there is a mechanism which also enhances the @xmath76 width to compensate for the increase in the @xmath83 width and which maintains the @xmath93 lifetime ratio near unity .",
    "such a mechanism would be relevant to the charm counting and semileptonic branching fraction problem . in either case",
    ", there will be experimental consequences in the pattern of hadronic @xmath2 branching fractions .",
    "cleo can experimentally compare other @xmath75 and @xmath84 decays including @xmath94 and @xmath95 as well decays to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 to check the first possibility .",
    "it is important to measure the size of @xmath100 , the amplitude for the gluonic penguin , in order to interpret the cp violating asymmetries which will be observed at future facilities .",
    "gluonic penguin modes will also be used to search for direct cp violation at future facilities .    3.0 truein    cleo - ii has observed a signal in the sum of @xmath101 and @xmath102 with a branching fraction of @xmath103 and for the individual modes @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "similiar results with consistent branching fractions have been reported by delphi@xcite and aleph@xcite .",
    "cleo - ii has also observed a signal in the sum of @xmath106 and @xmath107.@xcite the combined branching fraction is @xmath108 . in all of these cases , due to the paucity of events and the difficulty of distinguishing high momentum kaons and pions , the conclusion is that either @xmath109 or @xmath15 decays or a combination of the two processes has been observed .",
    "another approach using quasi - inclusive decays is described in a recent cleo contribution@xcite . at the @xmath52 ,",
    "two body decays from @xmath15 can be distinguished from @xmath110 decays by examination of the inclusive particle momentum spectrum ; the @xmath15 decays populate a region beyond the kinematic limit for @xmath110 .",
    "this approach has been applied to inclusive @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 production .",
    "a search for inclusive signatures of @xmath114 gluon rather than exclusive signatures has two possible advantages .",
    "the inclusive rate may be calculable from first principles and is expected to be at least an order of magnitude larger than the rate for any exclusive channel .",
    "for example , the branching fraction for @xmath115 ( where @xmath116 ) is @xmath117@xcite,@xcite and the branching fraction for the inclusive process @xmath118 is expected to be @xmath119 in the standard model@xcite , while low multiplicity decay modes such as @xmath120 or @xmath121 are expected to have branching fractions of order @xmath122 .",
    "the disadvantage of employing an inclusive method is the severe continuum background that must be subtracted or suppressed .",
    "3.0 truein    the decay @xmath123 , where @xmath124 denotes a meson containing an @xmath125 quark , is dominated by the gluonic penguins , @xmath126 @xmath127 , @xmath128 or @xmath129 . the decay @xmath130 , where @xmath131 denotes a meson which contains no @xmath125 quark , arises from a similiar gluonic penguin , @xmath126 @xmath132 .",
    "an analogous search for @xmath126 , @xmath127 was carried out by cleo using high momentum @xmath113 production@xcite . in the search for high momentum @xmath113 production , limits were obtained using two complementary techniques .",
    "a purely inclusive technique with shape cuts gave a limit @xmath133 for @xmath134 gev .",
    "using the @xmath2 reconstruction technique , in which combinations of the @xmath113 candidate , a kaon , and up to 4 pions were required to be consistent with a @xmath2 candidate , gave a limit of @xmath135 for @xmath136 gev , corresponding to @xmath137 gev .",
    "these results can be compared to the standard model calculation of deshpande _",
    "et al._@xcite , which predicts that the branching fraction for this process should lie in the range @xmath138 and that @xmath139 of the @xmath113 mesons from this mechanism will lie in the range of the experimental search .",
    "et al._@xcite predict a branching fraction for @xmath140 in the range @xmath141 .",
    "one sees that the sensitivity of the inclusive method is nearly sufficient to observe a signal from standard model @xmath15 .    using the purely inclusive technique ,",
    "a modest excess was observed in the signal region for quasi two - body @xmath142 decays",
    ". a 90% confidence level upper limit of for the momentum interval @xmath143 , @xmath144 is obtained .",
    "further work is in progress to improve the sensitivity in this channel .",
    "examination of high momentum @xmath112 production shows no excess and gives a 90% confidence level upper limit of @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "we expect that gluonic penguin decays will be observed in the near future by cleo .",
    "more theoretical work is required to convert the limits presented here as well as future observations into constraints on the quark level process @xmath147 .",
