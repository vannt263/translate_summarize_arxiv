    "the recurrent nova t  pyxidis was discovered by leavitt ( 1914 ) ; a history of the object , and some recent observations , may be found in webbink et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and shara et al .",
    "a compact ( @xmath4 ) nebula surrounding the star is described by duerbeck & seitter ( 1979 ) and williams ( 1982 ) , and a larger , fainter shell is observed by shara et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . _ hubble space telescope _ imagery of the t  pyx nebula ( shara et al .",
    "1997 ) reveals an exceptionally complex , clumpy structure on subarcsecond spatial scales , and the brightness of at least some of these knots varies on timescales of months . as pointed out by these authors , the _ hst _ data",
    "vividly demonstrate that  shell \" is a quite misleading term for the extended structure near t  pyx , which in fact consists of literally thousands of discrete lumps , most bright in [ nii ] emission .",
    "recently an interesting spectrum of t  pyx has been presented by shahbaz et al .",
    "they call attention to a strong , unfamiliar emission line at @xmath5 , and a weaker feature at @xmath6 .",
    "they interpret these features as doppler - shifted h@xmath2 lines from a collimated jet emerging from t  pyx , at velocities of + 1400 and @xmath7  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "as there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect these particular velocities , and no second spectral feature to confirm them , care must obviously be taken when accepting this interpretation ; virtually any unidentified emission line , regardless of wavelength , can be attributed to such a model .",
    "nonetheless this interpretation if correct is very exciting : as stressed by shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , this would make t  pyx the first short - period cataclysmic variable with a jet .",
    "livio ( 1998 ) , who comments that  jet lines have now been observed unambiguously in the recurrent nova t  pyx , \" stresses that there would be profound implications on models of jet formation .    in an effort to clarify this unprecedented interpretation",
    ", we obtained further spectra of t  pyx and the surrounding nebula .",
    "although we verify the existence of the unusual emission lines , the features unfortunately prove to have a less exotic origin than that suggested by shahbaz et al .",
    "on ut 1997 december  6 , we obtained spectrophotometry of t  pyx with the 3.5-m telescope of the astrophysical research consortium , located at apache point , nm , using the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) in its high - resolution mode . in this configuration , dis simultaneously provides two spectra , each of about 1000    coverage in disjoint wavelength ranges , split by a dichroic mirror onto two ccds .",
    "a slit measuring @xmath9 @xmath10 was employed ; the measured fwhm of comparison arc lines indicates that a spectral resolution of @xmath11    was achieved .",
    "the slit was oriented e / w , passing through the star as well as a series of the bright knots in the nova shell located within a few arcsec of the central object ( shara et al .",
    "1997 ) .    at @xmath12 , t  pyx is not well - located for observation from apache point , so observations were confined to two hours centered on the meridian .",
    "a total of 6600  s of integration in 6 separate exposures was obtained , and the data summed together for analysis .",
    "approximate flux calibration was achieved via observation of spectrophotometric standard stars from massey et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and massey & gronwall ( 1990 ) .",
    "however at these large airmasses , the combination of differential refraction and uncertain light losses at the slit are such that these absolute fluxes can not be regarded as more accurate than @xmath13  mag .",
    "the two resulting spectra appear in figure  1 .",
    "strong balmer and hei emission are evident , as is typical in many old novae , as well as the prominent ciii / niii @xmath14 blend and especially heii @xmath14686 .",
    "the spectrum is similar to that displayed by williams ( 1983 ) and described by duerbeck & seitter ( 1987 ) .",
    "we reiterate the remarks by williams ( 1983 ) and williams ( 1989 ) concerning the great strength of heii @xmath14686 , which equals or exceeds h@xmath15 in intensity . as this latter circumstance",
    "is usually seen only in magnetic cataclysmic variables , the polarization properties of t  pyx are clearly of great interest and should be determined . because the extraction width of the data in figure  1 is @xmath0 , the stellar balmer and heii emission may also contain a component due to the surrounding nebula .",
    "low resolution spectral scans of the north portion of the nebula , uncontaminated by the star but spatially disjoint from the region observed in this work , by williams ( 1982 ) show a quite small value of @xmath14686/h@xmath15 , hinting but certainly not proving that the unusual ratio seen in the star is truly a valid measure .",
    "immediately evident in the red spectrum is a prominent , resolved emission line centered at @xmath16590 , which includes the unusual feature discovered by shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and termed  s@xmath16 \" by those authors .",
    "it is not obviously visible in the lower - resolution data of williams ( 1983 ) . in figure  2",
    "we present intensity contour maps of portions of the spectra displayed in figure  1 , but with the stellar continuum subtracted . here",
    "we also include the spatially - resolved data in the region @xmath17 from t  pyx , twice the areal coverage of figure  1 . in these maps ,",
    "the abscissa is wavelength , and the ordinate is the spatial direction e / w of the central star . even with the modest pixel scale of dis ( @xmath18  pix@xmath8 in the red , and @xmath19  pix@xmath8 in the blue ) , it is clear that substantial flux is detected in our data from the nebula , spatially resolved from the central star .",
    "although extensive dispersive nebular spectroscopy of t  pyx has not to our knowledge been presented , it is evident from the work of williams ( 1982 ) and shara et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1997 ) that [ nii ] @xmath16584 is very prominent in the knots of the nebula . in agreement with this past work , examination of the contours in figure  2 readily shows that we have also detected [ nii ] @xmath16584 , together with associated [ nii ] @xmath16548 , h@xmath2 , and [ oiii ] @xmath3 4959 , 5007 emission , at a number of separable , discrete velocities ( presumably each corresponding to one or a small number of bright nebular knots ) within a few arcseconds of t  pyx .",
    "interpretation of these data in a two - dimensional plane such as that of figure  2 can be confusing , as distinct spatial regions can overlap in projection , and velocity differences of @xmath20  km  s@xmath8 can result in the wavelength blending of h@xmath2 and the two red [ nii ] lines in one knot with different components of this same triple of lines from other , discrete velocity systems of another knot . to aid in identification of the strongest , most prominent velocity systems , we place on figure  2 colored bars at the location of [ oiii ] @xmath3 4959 , 5007 , h@xmath2 , and [ nii ] @xmath36548 , 6584 , using a distinct color for each of five identified velocity systems which are prominent .",
    "further velocity structure is evident , but more sophisticated representations of the results are probably not warranted by the relatively crude spectral and spatial resolution of our data . in any case , this analysis suffices to illustrate our most important conclusions .",
    "while we have included the appropriate heliocentric correction of @xmath21  km  s@xmath8 , the absolute velocity calibration of the spectrograph is uncertain at the level of @xmath22  km  s@xmath8 ; relative velocities should be more reliable .",
    "a slight additional complication is that due to differential refraction at this high airmass , the red and blue sides of the spectrograph are observing slightly different , although spatially adjacent , regions of the nebula separated by @xmath23 ( filippenko 1982 ) ; this small effect has no impact on the conclusions reached here .",
    "we first call attention to the  orange \" system , at @xmath24  km  s@xmath8 .",
    "this is very clearly nebular gas , detected simultaneously in five separate emission lines ( four of them forbidden ) at a consistent velocity , and colocated @xmath25 w of the star .",
    "now consider the nearby  red \" system , which lies essentially coincident with the stellar image in the e / w direction .",
    "figure  2 identifies the emission at @xmath16595 as [ nii ] @xmath16584 at @xmath26  km  s@xmath8 . for this velocity , [ nii ] @xmath16548 and h@xmath2",
    "are blended with the  purple \" and  blue \" systems , blue - shifted gas which probably falls only in projection , rather than spatial coincidence , on our image .",
    "however , note that the  red \" system does appear as expected in [ oiii ] @xmath14959 ( and can not be expected to appear in [ oiii ] @xmath15007 due to a precise overlap with the strong hei @xmath15015 from the star ) . furthermore , although it may be a projection effect , the most straightforward interpretation of the orange and red systems is that as they are reasonably adjacent in both velocity and e / w location , they are in fact physically adjacent in the nebula , and both are emission systems from knots in the shell .",
    "figure  2 shows clearly that in our data the [ nii ] @xmath16584 emission from the orange and red systems combine to form the prominent , spectrally - resolved ",
    "s@xmath16 \" emission line at @xmath16590 .",
    "although shahbaz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) do not provide details of the shape and size of the slit or aperture used to obtain their data , and in any case _ post facto _ reconstruction of the precise pointing location and seeing is probably not possible , we suggest that the  s@xmath16 \" described by these authors is also red - shifted [ nii ] @xmath16584 from knots in the nebula , either physically close to , or seen in projection close to , t  pyx .",
    "indeed , inspection of figure  2 shows that a narrow , on - axis aperture would produce emission centered at @xmath5 , exactly as they have reported .",
    "we believe that a similar explanation applies to the @xmath16539 ",
    "s@xmath27 \" emission line reported by shahbaz et al . , and again attributed by them to h@xmath2 emission from a collimated jet emitted by the star .",
    "we also detect this line , which we denote as the  violet \" system in figure  2 .",
    "we suggest that the ",
    "s@xmath27 \" line is in fact [ nii ] @xmath16548 at @xmath28  km  s@xmath8 . as this system",
    "is spatially projected very close to the star , other lines at the same velocity are difficult to discern , but are indeed present .",
    "for example , the corresponding [ nii ] @xmath16584 and [ oiii ] @xmath15007 lines in the violet system do appear as intensity peaks at the correct wavelengths , superposed on the stellar continuum , and are visible in figure  2 as excess contours .",
    "figure  2 illustrates that even given our meager data at one slit position angle , the velocity structure of the nebula is clearly complex .",
    "shara et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have demonstrated that the very small scale spatial structure of the knots is exceptionally intricate , and that knot intensities can fade and grow on a timescale of months .",
    "taken together this implies that ground - based spectral observations are not ideal to probe the velocity field , and that great caution must be employed when comparing data obtained even with the same equipment at different times , much less by different observers with different facilities .",
    "one can predict in advance that very minor differences in positioning of an entrance aperture , when convolved with the great spatial complexity of the shell , variable seeing , and the intrinsic flux variations of the object , will conspire to at least slightly change the observed profile , intensity , and mean wavelength of the @xmath16590 emission line .",
    "we have presented spatially - resolved spectrophotometry of t  pyx and portions of the surrounding nebula .",
    "recent _ hst _ images have vividly stressed how spatially complex the extended structure is . from our data , it is also clear that the shell is spectrally complex .",
    "we believe that there is little evidence that the prominent @xmath16590 emission line and its weaker companion at @xmath16540 are due to h@xmath2 from a collimated jet ejected by the star ( shahbaz et al .",
    "rather , we argue , based on the detection of multiple emission lines from different species at consistent velocities , that these lines are instead [ nii ] from a few , or possible even many , discrete knots .",
    "the large heii @xmath14686/h@xmath15 ratio , probably due to t  pyx itself , also bears further scrutiny ."
