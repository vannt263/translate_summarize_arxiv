    "the nature of the relaxation processes taking place in supercooled liquids approaching the glass transition has been a major subject of study for a number of years .",
    "understanding how the different response functions are connected in such systems is still a fundamental goal to reach .",
    "it is not clear whether the various observables display some universal features approaching the glass transition .",
    "although dielectric spectroscopy is the most common experimental tool , a more detailed characterization of their behavior can be obtained by measuring different quantities , like the _ shear modulus _ , that are important from a practical as well as theoretical point of view .",
    "although this dynamic variable can be measured above @xmath6 hz with conventional techniques , high - frequency data are scarce in the literature .    motivated by these reasons we employed the piezoelectric - shear - modulus - gauge ( psg )  @xcite method to measure the shear modulus of five glass - forming liquids .",
    "this technique allows us to measure the dynamic shear modulus of the supercooled liquids just above the glass transition where it takes values between 0.1 mpa and 10 gpa . by means of the psg technique we can easily observe the @xmath7 relaxation process in the shear response .",
    "the frequency range of the technique is wide ( @xmath8 hz ) , and we also observe a _ mechanical _ johari - goldstain @xmath2 relaxation  @xcite . as shown before   indeed , this technique is sensitive to the secondary process and we find evidence of the presence of a shear @xmath2 relaxation   in some of the mechanical spectra reported here .    in section",
    "ii we describe the experiment performed and the liquids studied reporting the frequency resolved mechanical spectra . in sec .",
    "iii we report the main findings of our study . in section iii we present the analyzed data showing the temperature dependence of the shear - mechanical @xmath7 relaxation frequency and a test of some conjectures and models about the dynamics . finally we draw some general conclusions in sec .",
    "the piezoelectric shear - modulus gauge ( psg ) method is based on the piezoelectric properties of the material that composes the measuring device .",
    "the piezoelectric transducer is formed by three discs made of a special ceramic compound  @xcite that has a pronounced piezoelectric effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psg ] ) .",
    "the working principle of the psg is illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : psg ] where the one disc equivalent of the three discs system is shown .",
    "the ceramic disc is covered with a silver layer on both faces constituting the electrodes .",
    "when a voltage is applied , each disc expands or contracts depending on its intrinsic polarization and on the direction of the acting electric field .",
    "the electric capacitance of the disc depends on its strain state so that , if a material is partially clamping its motion , the measured capacitance will be lower than that of the free moving disc . measuring accurately this electrical capacitance  @xcite we can obtain the stiffness of the medium adhering to the disc .",
    "in other words we can convert the electric impedance into the shear modulus knowing the exact relationship between the two  @xcite .",
    "the three - discs geometry , used in the experiment ( main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : psg ] ) is employed to reduce unwanted effect like the bending motion that would be present in a one - disc device .",
    "the interested reader can find details about the technique in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the measurements are performed cooling the liquids via a home - built closed - cycle cryostat  @xcite .",
    "this has an absolute uncertainty on the temperature that is less than 0.2 k and a temperature stability better than 2 mk .",
    "the liquids studied are the following : pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane ( dc705 ) , dibutyl phthalate ( dbp ) , diethyl phthalate ( dep ) , 1,2-propanediol , and m - touluidine .",
    "the dc705 is a diffusion - pump oil from dow corning , all the other liquids were acquired from sigma - aldrich .",
    "no filtration or purification of the samples was performed before the measurement .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it has been suggested from empirical observations  @xcite that when tts applies , the high frequency decay of the dielectric loss is characterized by a power - law behavior @xmath9 with exponent @xmath10 .",
    "a theoretical explanation for this power - law dependence of the dielectric response has been proposed assuming the dominance of long - wavelength fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we have tested this conjecture for the mechanical response finding the minimum value of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12_{min}$ ] .",
    "it has to be noted that the extraction of this information is much more complicated for the shear loss than the dielectric response .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shear response is generally affected by a higher noise level than dielectric .",
    "an example of the procedure followed to extract @xmath13 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : anamin ] for the mechanical response of m - toluidine at @xmath14k .",
    "when @xmath7 is plotted as a function of the frequency a minimum can be identified within some data points .",
    "the average of these points is taken as the @xmath13 .",
    "note that a debye - process would have a characteristic behavior of the logarithmic slope showing a sudden drop of @xmath7 at the relaxation frequency @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : amin ] we report the value of @xmath13 as a function of the loss peak frequency for the temperatures where the minimum of the derivative of the logarithm was well defined .",
    "we note that even if the behavior of this quantity for the liquids studied is compatible with a limiting @xmath10 at low - temperatures , the data seems to lie systematically above the @xmath16 line .",
    "we stress also that is easy to expect that an @xmath17 behavior in the shear loss is disturbed more when a @xmath2 relaxation is present since its intensity is enhanced in the mechanical spectrum compared to the dielectric .",
    "finally we remark that the parameter @xmath13 is not expected to monotonically decrease in a wider temperature range .",
    "indeed at higher temperatures the shape of the shear - response should recover a simpler debye - like shape where the stretching parameters ( the kkw @xmath2 parameter for example ) come close to the unity@xcite .",
    "the relaxation frequencies belonging to this high temperature regime are currently outside the dynamical window of the psg technique@xcite .    .",
    "in this figure we report the analysis of the mechanical spectrum of m - toluidine at @xmath14k .",
    "the derivative of @xmath18gpa ) with respect to @xmath19hz ) is plotted as a function the frequency ( stars ) .",
    "some points are selected ( red circles ) and their average is taken to calculate @xmath13 ( red line ) .",

    "the shoving model  @xcite is based on the assumption that the relaxation in the supercooled liquid takes place with a local volume increase and that the activation energy is mainly elastic energy spent to shove aside the surrounding of the rearranging molecules . as it has been reported this model",
    "can be derived estimating the barrier height in a classical energy landscape approach@xcite .",
    "the shoving model predicts that the relaxation time is related to the infinite - frequency shear modulus @xmath25 by the equation :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a characteristic volume in a relaxation process ( @xmath27 is assumed temperature independent ) and @xmath28 is the phonon - frequency ( @xmath29s ) . the determination of @xmath25 is not necessary to test the model if tts applies , indeed if this property holds we can write    @xmath30    since the constant factor @xmath31 determining the amplitude of the complex response in @xmath32 is the same for the real and the imaginary part @xmath33 and @xmath34 . note that this proportionality does not apply when tts does not hold .",
    "for example in a case where the @xmath2 relaxation is present the value of @xmath25 is modified by the secondary process and a more complicated fitting procedure would be needed to estimate the value of the infinite - frequency shear - modulus .",
    "on the other hand , when tts is satisfied , we can write the simple equation ( using eq.([eq : t ] ) in eq.([eq : s ] ) )    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a constant factor .",
    "eq ( [ eq : sp ] ) represents the prediction of the shoving model when tts also applies : the logarithm of the relaxation time is a linear function of the quantity @xmath37 .",
    "this is tested in fig .",
    "[ fig : shovin ] for the liquids in which time - temperature superposition is found to hold ( dc705 and 1,2-propanediol ) . in this figure the relaxation time ( defined as @xmath38 )",
    "is reported as a function of @xmath39 and as a function of @xmath40 . to report all the data in the same plot the abscissa has been normalized to the unity as @xmath41 and as @xmath42 .",
    "note that here we find @xmath43 through a linear extrapolation of the last values @xmath44 to @xmath45 previously identified to give @xmath46hz ( corresponding to @xmath47s ) .",
    "the dashed line in fig . [ fig : shovin ] represents the shoving model prediction ( no adjustable paremeters are used in this function ) ending , at high temperature , at the physically reasonable prefactot @xmath48s .     of the shear loss as a function of the scaled temperature @xmath49 ( full symbols ) and as function of @xmath50 ( open symbols ) for the liquids",
    "in which tts applies : dc705 ( , @xmath51 k ) and 1,2-propanediol ( @xmath23 , @xmath52 k ) .",
    "the dashed line is an exponential function with prefactor @xmath53 s and taking the value @xmath54s s for x=1 ( no free parameters are adjusted in this function).,width=359 ]",
    "we have reported shear - mechanical spectra of five glass - forming liquids close to @xmath45 . via the psg",
    "@xcite technique we have investigated the behavior of the mechanical @xmath7 process and found evidence of the presence of a mechanical @xmath2 relaxation in dibutyl phthalate , diethyl phthalate and in m - toluidine .",
    "time - temperature superposition for the mechanical susceptibility is found to hold for the liquids without signature of @xmath2 process ( pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane and 1,2-propanediol ) .",
    "the conjecture originally developed for the dielectric response that , when tts applies , a @xmath17 decay is found for the high frequency part of the loss is checked for the shear response .",
    "we find that the data are consistent with a limiting @xmath17 low - temperature behavior although the minimum slopes are systematically higher than @xmath16 .",
    "the shoving model has been tested for the two liquids without @xmath2 relaxation finding that it well describes the experimental data .",
    "center for viscous liquid dynamics _ glass and time _ is sponsored by the danish national research foundation ( dnrf ) .",
    "note that a number of problems could be present in such low - temperature measurements .",
    "there is the possibility of damaging the piezo - discs because of the sandwiched glass contracting , nevertheless unknown memory effects could be induced in piezo - ceramics lowering repetitively their temperature when the stresses are not fully relaxed .",
    "the high - frequency limit of the psg technique ( 10 khz ) is set by the geometrical and material properties of the piezo - electric discs . above this frequency",
    "the response of the measuring device is dominated by the intrinsic resonances of the piezo - ceramics ( see ref.[1 ] ) .",
