    "classical models which give rise to solitons , such as the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) or nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations , describe uniform nonlinear waveguides . for example",
    ", the nls equation is a basic model to describe light propagation in optical fibers and other guiding structures @xcite , while a well - known application of the kdv equation is the description of internal waves in stratified fluids , propagating in waveguides which exist naturally in the ocean , or can be created in a laboratory @xcite . in both these models , a ( bright ) soliton exists under a certain condition : in the nls equation , the dispersion must be anomalous @xcite , while in the kdv equation , the soliton must have a definite polarity .",
    "the necessity to improve stability , bit rate , and other operation characteristics for soliton streams in optical fibers , have recently attracted a great deal of attention to the technique of `` dispersion management '' ( dm ) , i.e. , transmission of solitons in an optical fiber which consists of periodically alternating sections with _ opposite _ signs of the dispersion , so that the average dispersion of the long communication link is nearly equal to zero @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nls equation with a variable dispersion coefficient is no longer integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform , and no exact soliton solution is known for it .",
    "nevertheless , very accurate numerical simulations show that , to an extremely high accuracy , this equation gives rise to solitons with an approximately gaussian ( rather than the ordinary @xmath0 ) , _ pulsating _ shape @xcite .",
    "the existence of _ dispersion - managed _ solitons of this type is also strongly supported by analytical results produced by the variational approximation developed for the dm model in different forms @xcite , as well as by analysis of the model transformed into an integral equation @xcite ( note that the variational approximation can also be applied directly to the integral equation @xcite ) .",
    "a remarkable property of dm solitons is that they may exist , in a stable form , even when the average dispersion , which is not necessarily exactly zero , but may be much smaller than the local dispersion in the alternating fiber segments , is _ normal _",
    "@xcite ( recall that the ordinary nls solitons can not exist in the case of the normal dispersion ) .",
    "it is necessary to mention that , prior to the appearance of the dm models with the above - mentioned piece - wise constant form of the dispersion profile , the nls equation with a harmonically ( sinusoidally ) modulated sign - changing dispersion term had already been studied in detail , with a conclusion , based on both the variational approximation and direct simulations , that stable pulsating solitons do exist in that smoothly modulated model @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nls equation with the local dispersion subject to strong periodic modulation belongs to a class of _ periodic heterogeneous _",
    "systems , in which stable pulsating solitons with nontrivial properties may be expected ( in this work , we use the term `` soliton '' without assuming integrability of the corresponding model ) . in nonlinear optics , other systems belonging to this class",
    "are _ tandem waveguides _ for optical solitons supported by quadratic ( @xmath1 ) nonlinearity , based on alternation of @xmath1 and linear segments @xcite , _ split - step _ fiber links , in which linear segments alternate with those dominated by the kerr ( @xmath2 ) nonlinearity @xcite , _ layered _ bulk media , with the @xmath2 coefficient varying between the layers so that an optical beam propagating across the layers has its power oscillating around a critical value leading to the wave collapse @xcite , and _ alternate _ nonlinear waveguides , composed of periodically alternating waveguiding and _ _ anti__waveguiding segments @xcite . a remarkable feature , common to all these systems , despite their very different physical nature , is robustness of the propagation modes , and the absence of any apparent instability , even when this might naively be expected .    the identification of this class of models , essentially based on the nls equation , makes it natural to ask whether other ordinary soliton - generating equations , if subjected to a periodic modulation of the dispersion coefficient , can give rise to the propagation of pulsating robust solitary wave ( provided that a corresponding model describes a physically meaningful situation ) .",
    "the first candidate to be investigated is the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation . in fact , the kdv equation with variable coefficients is a traditional object for the application of the perturbation theory for solitons @xcite .",
    "however , the case of periodic modulation , and the consequent possibility of the existence of a quasi - stable pulsating soliton in this case has not yet been studied .",

    "equations of this general form are commonly used to describe the propagation of solitary waves in inhomogeneous media , for instance , surface and internal waves in stratified fluids @xcite .",

    ", the wave modes are localized near critical layers , where the long - wave speed is within the range of the shear velocity . generally speaking , in all these applications",

    "<S> the existence of `` dispersion - managed solitons '' , i.e. , stable pulsating solitary - wave solutions to the nonlinear schrdinger equation with periodically modulated and sign - variable dispersion is now well known in nonlinear optics . our purpose here is to investigate whether similar structures exist for other well - known nonlinear wave models . </S>",
    "<S> hence , here we consider as a basic model the variable - coefficient korteweg - de vries equation ; this has the form of a korteweg - de vries equation with a periodically varying third - order dispersion coefficient , that can take both positive and negative values . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , this model may be extended to include fifth - order dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> such models may describe , for instance , periodically modulated waveguides for long gravity - capillary waves . </S>",
    "<S> we develop an analytical approximation for solitary waves in the weakly nonlinear case , from which it is possible to obtain a reduction to a relatively simple integral equation , which is readily solved numerically . then , we describe some systematic direct simulations of the full equation , which use the soliton shape produced by the integral equation as an initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations reveal regions of stable and unstable pulsating solitary waves in the corresponding parametric space . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the effects of fifth - order dispersion .    * </S>",
    "<S> the existence of `` dispersion - managed solitons '' , i.e. , stable pulsating solitary - wave solutions to the nonlinear schrdinger equation with periodically modulated dispersion , its mean value being approximately equal to zero , is well known in nonlinear optics . </S>",
    "<S> however the periodic modulation of other nonlinear integrable wave equations has received little attention . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the korteweg  de vries equation with a periodic dispersion coefficient whose average value is small . </S>",
    "<S> the model applies to long gravity - capillary waves and natural waveguides for internal waves in a stratified ocean . using analytical and numerical techniques , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for harmonic and piecewise - constant profiles of the dispersion modulation , stable pulsating solitons with small amplitudes exist . </S>",
    "<S> they become unstable with the increase of the initial amplitude or mean dispersion . *    ' '' '' </S>"
