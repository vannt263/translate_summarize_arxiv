    "summaries of measurements of @xmath5  from various processes and at different energy scales @xmath12 demonstrate @xcite that the energy dependence of @xmath2  is in good agreement with the prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the uncertainties of these measurements , both experimental and theoretical , are different and their correlations are , in general , not known @xcite .",
    "more quantitative studies of the running of @xmath5  therefore require the existence of consistent measurements over large ranges of the energy scale @xmath12 , for the same process , using identical experimental techniques and theoretical calculations in order to minimise point - to - point systematic uncertainties .",
    "significant progress has been made in perturbative qcd calculations since 1992 .",
    "observables have been proposed for which perturbative predictions are extended beyond the next - to - leading - order ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , through the inclusion of leading and next - to - leading logarithms which are summed to all orders of @xmath5  ( nlla ) @xcite .",
    "these calculations exhibit a better stability to contributions of unknown higher order corrections , which are usually estimated by variations of the renormalisation scale @xmath13 .    the experiments at lep and slc provided a number of significant determinations of @xmath5  from hadronic event shapes and jet production , based on @xmath1+nlla calculations , at centre - of - mass energies @xmath14 at and above 91  gev , the mass of the @xmath15  boson .",
    "detailed studies of the high statistics data samples from the lep experiments provide a better understanding of the phenomenology of the hadronisation process and thus of the modelling of hadronic final states with monte carlo programs .",
    "determinations of @xmath5   at lep and slc  @xcite therefore have smaller uncertainties than those which are available from previous measurements at lower @xmath0  centre - of - mass energies  @xcite .",
    "there are only a few recent measurements of @xmath5  at lower energies .",
    "these either employed only some of the observables which are now available  @xcite or they were based on limited samples of @xmath15  decays with final state photon radiation  @xcite . therefore equivalent studies with data in the centre - of - mass energy range from @xmath16 to @xmath17  gev , taken at the petra collider which was shut down in 1986 , are desirable .    in this paper",
    "we present an @xmath1+nlla determination of @xmath5  at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath8 gev using data from the jade experiment  @xcite at petra .",
    "the selection of the jade data and monte carlo event samples are described in section  [ sec - data ] .",
    "the measurement of event shape distributions , the corrections for detector imperfections and for initial state photon radiation as well as the estimate of the experimental uncertainties are outlined in section  [ sec - procedure ] .",
    "the corrected event shape distributions and the determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath2   are presented in section  [ sec - alphas ] .",
    "a study of the energy dependence of mean values of event shape distributions and their comparison with analytic qcd calculations comprising power corrections to account for hadronisation effects is presented in section  [ sec - meanvalues ] . in section",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] the results are summarised and the conclusions are drawn .",
    "for the studies presented in this paper , we analysed data recorded with the jade detector in 1981 , 1984 to 1985 , and 1986 at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath20  gev , @xmath21-@xmath17  gev , and around @xmath19  gev , respectively .",
    "the jade detector was one of the five experiments at the petra electron - positron collider .",
    "it was operated from 1979 until 1986 at centre - of - mass energies of @xmath22 to @xmath17 gev .",
    "a detailed description of the jade detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the main components of the detector were the central jet chamber to measure charged particle tracks and the lead glass calorimeter to measure energy depositions of electromagnetic showers , which both covered almost the whole solid angle of @xmath23 .",
    "multihadronic events were selected by the standard jade selection cuts  @xcite which were based on minimum energy deposits in the calorimeter and a minimum number of tracks emanating from the interaction region .",
    "all charged particle tracks with a total momentum of @xmath24  mev@xmath25 were considered in the analysis .",
    "energy clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter were considered if their energies exceeded @xmath26 mev after correction for energy deposited by associated tracks .",
    "charged particle tracks were assumed to be pions while the photon hypothesis was assigned to electromagnetic energy clusters .    in order to remove background from two - photon processes and @xmath27-pair events and from events which lost a substantial part of their energy due to hard initial state photon radiation ,",
    "further constraints were imposed on the visible energy @xmath28 , the total missing momentum @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the 3-momentum and the energy of the tracks and clusters ) , the longitudinal balance relative to the @xmath0  beam axis of momenta @xmath32 and the polar angle of the thrust axis , @xmath33 :    * @xmath34  ; * @xmath35  ; * @xmath36  ; * @xmath37  .    with these cuts , the backgrounds from @xmath38 and @xmath27-pair events",
    "were reduced to less than @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the final numbers of events which were retained for this analysis are listed in table  [ tab - eventnumbers ] .",
    ".[tab - eventnumbers ] number of events in data and in monte carlo detector simulation retained after application of the multihadron selection cuts described in the text .",
