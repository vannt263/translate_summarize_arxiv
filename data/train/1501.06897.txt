    "<S> the ferrimagnetic spinels mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = mn , v ) exhibit a similar series of closely spaced magnetic and structural phase transitions at low temperatures , reflecting both magnetic frustration and a strong coupling between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> careful studies of excitations in mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = mn , v ) , and the evolution of these excitations with temperature , are important for obtaining a microscopic description of the role that magnetic excitations and spin - lattice coupling play in the low temperature phase transitions of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> we report an inelastic light ( raman ) scattering study of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of one- and two - magnon excitations in mnv@xmath3o@xmath1 and mn@xmath4o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a pair of @xmath5 one - magnon modes at 74  @xmath6 and 81  @xmath6 in mnv@xmath3o@xmath1 , which is in contrast with the single 80  @xmath6 @xmath5 magnon that has been reported for mnv@xmath3o@xmath1 based on previous neutron scattering measurements and spin wave calculations . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we find that the two - magnon energy of mnv@xmath3o@xmath1 decreases ( `` softens '' ) with decreasing temperature below @xmath7 , which we attribute to strong coupling between magnetic and vibrational excitations near the zone boundary . </S>"
