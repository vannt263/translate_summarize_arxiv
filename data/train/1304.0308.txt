    ", the physics of the bilayer quantum hall ( qh ) system is enormously rich owing to the intralayer and interlayer phase coherence controlled by the interplay between the spin and the layer ( pseudospin ) degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "the interlayer phase coherence is an especially intriguing phenomenon in the bilayer qh system @xcite , where it is enhanced in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , at the filling factor @xmath0 there arises a unique phase , the spin - ferromagnet and pseudospin - ferromagnet phase , which has been well studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one of the most intriguing phenomena is the josephson tunneling between the two layers predicted in refs.@xcite , whose first experimental indication was obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "other examples are the anomalous behavior of the hall resistance reported in counterflow experiments@xcite and in drag experiments@xcite .",

    "on the other hand , at @xmath1 the bilayer qh system has three phases , the spin - ferromagnet and pseudospin - singlet phase ( abridged as the spin phase ) , the spin - singlet and pseudospin ferromagnet phase ( abridged as the pseudospin phase ) and a canted antiferromagnetic phase@xcite ( abridged as the caf phase ) , depending on the relative strength between the zeeman energy @xmath4 and the interlayer tunneling energy @xmath5 .",
