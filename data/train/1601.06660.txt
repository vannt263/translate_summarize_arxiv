    "the structure of low - lying states in nuclei around the beta - stability valley , i.e. , low - energy spectra , nuclear moments , electromagnetic transitions , is well described by the standard shell model ( sm ) . in a vicinity of the neutron or proton drip lines , the atomic nucleus becomes weakly bound or even unbound in the ground state , and hence the description of its basic properties requires an explicit consideration of the coupling to the scattering continuum and decay channels .",

    "<S> * background : * + according to standard stellar evolution , lithium abundance is believed to be a useful indicator of the stellar age . however , many evolved stars like red giants show huge fluctuations around expected theoretical abundances that are not yet fully understood . the better knowledge of nuclear reactions that contribute to the creation and destruction of lithium can help to solve this puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> + * purpose : * in this work we apply the gamow shell model ( gsm ) formulated in the coupled - channel representation ( gsm - cc ) to investigate the mirror radiative capture reactions @xmath0li@xmath1@xmath2be and @xmath0li@xmath3@xmath2li . + * method : * gsm offers the most general treatment of couplings between discrete resonant states and the non - resonant continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sections are calculated using a translationally invariant hamiltonian with the finite - range interaction which is adjusted to reproduce spectra , binding energies and one - nucleon separation energies in @xmath4li , @xmath2be . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction channels are built by coupling the wave functions of ground state @xmath5 and excited states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 of @xmath0li with the projectile wave function in different partial waves . + </S>",
    "<S> * results : * we include all relevant @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 transitions from the initial continuum states to the final bound states @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath2li and @xmath2be . </S>",
    "<S> our microscopic astrophysical factor for the @xmath0li(p,@xmath14)@xmath2be reaction follows the average trend of the experimental value as a function of the center of mass energy . for @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the calculated cross section agrees well with the data from the direct measurement of this reaction at stellar energies . </S>",
    "<S> + * conclusion : * we demonstrate that the @xmath16-wave radiative capture of proton ( neutron ) to the first excited state @xmath17 of @xmath2be ( @xmath2li ) is crucial and increases the total astrophysical @xmath18-factor by about 40 % . </S>"
