    "a @xmath0-analog of the chebychev s discrete orthogonal polynomials is due to markov in 1884 @xcite , which can be regarded as the first example of a @xmath0-polynomial family . in 1949",

    "the @xmath0-polynomials have been studied by many authors from different points of view .",
    "there are two most recognized approaches .",
    "the first approach , initiated by the work of askey and wilson @xcite ( see also andrews and askey @xcite ) is based on the basic hypergeometric series @xcite .",
    "the second approach is due to nikiforov and uvarov @xcite and uses the analysis of difference equations on non - uniform lattices .",
    "the readers are also referred to the surveys @xcite .",
    "these approaches are associated with the so - called @xmath0-askey scheme @xcite and the nikiforov - uvarov scheme @xcite , respectively .",
    "another approach was published in @xcite where the authors proved several characterizations of the @xmath0-polynomials starting from the so - called distributional @xmath0-pearson equation ( for the non @xmath0-case see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in particular , in @xcite a classification of all possible families of orthogonal polynomials on the exponential lattice",
    "was established , and latter on in @xcite the comparison with the @xmath0-askey and nikiforov - uvarov schemes was done , resulting in two new families of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "furthermore , an important contribution to the theory of ( orthogonal ) @xmath0-polynomials , and in particular , to the theory of orthogonal @xmath0-polynomials on the linear exponential lattice , appeared in the recent book @xcite .",

    ", we deal with the orthogonality properties of the @xmath0-polynomials of the @xmath0-hahn tableau from a different viewpoint than the one used in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented a unified study of the orthogonality of @xmath0-polynomials based on the favard theorem . here , the main idea is to provide a relatively simple geometrical analysis of the @xmath0-pearson equation by taking into account every possible rational form of the polynomial coefficients of the @xmath0-difference equation .",
    "roughly , our qualitative analysis is concerned with the examination of the behavior of the graphs of the ratio @xmath33 by means of the definite right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of ( [ openqpearson ] ) in order to find out a suitable @xmath0-weight function .",
    "such a qualitative analysis implies all possible orthogonality relations among the polynomial solutions of the @xmath0-difference equation in question .",
    "moreover , it allows us to extend the orthogonality relations for some well - known @xmath0-polynomials of the hahn class to a larger set of their parameters ( see sections [ s4.1 ] and [ s4.2 ] ) .",
    "a first attempt of using a geometrical approach for studying the orthogonality of @xmath0-polynomials of the @xmath0-hahn class was presented in @xcite . however , the study is far from being complete and only some partial results were obtained",
    ". we will fill this gap in this review paper .",
    "our main goal is to study each orthogonal polynomial system or sequence ( ops ) , which is orthogonal with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "a @xmath0-weight function @xmath34 satisfying the @xmath0-pearson equation as well as certain boundary conditions ( bcs ) to be introduced in section 2 . for each family of polynomial solutions of ( [ qeht1 ] )",
    "we search for the ones that are orthogonal in a suitable intervals depending on the range of the parameters coming from the coefficients of ( [ qeht1 ] ) and the corresponding @xmath0-pearson equation .",
    "hence , in section 2 , we present the candidate intervals by inspecting the bcs as well as some preliminary results .",
    "theorems which help to calculate @xmath0-weight functions are given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 deals with the qualitative analysis including the theorems stating the main results of our article .",
    "the last section concludes the paper with some final remarks .",
    "we first introduce the so - called @xmath0-jackson integrals and afterward a well known theorem for the orthogonality of polynomial solutions of ( [ qeht1 ] ) in order to make the article self - contained @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-jackson integrals for @xmath35 @xcite are defined by @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath39 when @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . furthermore , we make use of the _ improper _ @xmath0-jackson integrals @xmath42\\ ] ] where the second one is sometimes called the _ bilateral _ @xmath0-integral .",
    "the _ @xmath7-jackson integrals _ are defined similarly .",
    "for instance , the improper _",
    "@xmath7-jackson integral _ on @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 provided that @xmath45 and the series is convergent .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath26 be a function satisfying the @xmath0-pearson equation ( [ openqpearson ] ) in such a way that the bcs @xmath46 also hold .",
    "then the sequence @xmath47 of polynomial solutions of ( [ qeht1 ] ) are orthogonal on @xmath48 w.r.t @xmath49 in the sense that @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the norm of the polynomials @xmath53 and the kronecker delta , respectively .",
    "analogously , if the conditions @xmath54 are fulfilled , the @xmath0-polynomials then satisfy the relation @xmath55    [ rem2.2 ] the relation ( [ qorthogonality ] ) means that the polynomials @xmath56 are orthogonal with respect to a measure supported on the set of points @xmath57 and @xmath58 . since we are interested in the positive definite cases , i.e. , when @xmath59 , then ,    * when @xmath60 , the measure is supported on the set of points @xmath58 in @xmath61 $ ] .",

    "a similar analysis can be done for the relation ( [ q-1orthogonality ] ) .",
    "according to theorem [ t1 ] , we have to determine an interval @xmath48 in which @xmath26 is @xmath0-integrable and @xmath66 on the lattice points of the types @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "such a weight function will be a solution of the @xmath0-pearson equation ( [ openqpearson ] ) . to this end , a qualitative analysis of the @xmath0-pearson equation is presented by a detailed inspection of the r.h.s . of ( [ openqpearson ] ) .",

    ". however , we have to take into consideration three different situations .",
    "\\(i ) let @xmath41 .",

    "@xmath49 vanishes at the points @xmath77 in @xmath80 and @xmath78 out of @xmath80 .",
    "then , the only possibility to have an ops on @xmath84 $ ] depends on the existence of @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "this condition , however , implies that @xmath87 and that @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and , therefore , it must be rejected .",
    "the similar statement is true when @xmath90 , which can be obtained by a simple linear scaling transformation so that it does not represent an independent case .",
    "\\(iii ) let @xmath91 ( or , @xmath92 ) .",
    "this case is much more involved .",
    "first of all , if @xmath60 is a zero of @xmath93 then it is a zero of @xmath94 as well , both containing a factor @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the r.h.s . of @xmath0-pearson equation ( [ openqpearson ] ) can be simplified and * pi*(i)-(ii ) are not valid anymore .",
    "in fact , in this case an ops w.r.t . a measure supported on the set of points",
    "@xmath82 in @xmath61 $ ] can be defined .",
    "the relation in ( [ ide - sr ] ) suggest an alternative possibility to define an ops on @xmath80 .",
    "namely , if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are both zeros of @xmath97 , by using ( [ openqpearson ] ) rewritten of the form @xmath98 it follows that @xmath49 vanishes at the points @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath69 .",
    "then two different situations appear depending on whether @xmath41 or @xmath40 . in the first case , @xmath101 at the points @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath69 in @xmath102 $ ] , which is not interesting . in the second case ,",

    "* let @xmath95 and @xmath74 be the roots of @xmath72 and @xmath71 , respectively",

    "limiting case of @xmath113 $ ] , it can be possible to introduce a desired weight function supported on the set @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath40 , on the other hand , @xmath26 vanishes for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "thus there could be an ops w.r.t . a measure supported on the finite set of points @xmath116 provided that @xmath86 for some finite @xmath85 integer .",
