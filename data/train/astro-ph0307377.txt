    "deep x - ray surveys with the _ chandra _ observatory ( brandt et al . 2001a ; mushotzky et .",
    "2000 ) have demonstrated beyond any doubt the appearance of ` normal ' ( i.e. non - agn dominated ) star - forming galaxies at faint flux limits , @xmath14 ( brandt et al .",

    "these systems are detected in increasing numbers with decreasing x - ray flux and are likely to outnumber agns below @xmath15 ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2002b ; ranalli , comastri & setti 2003 ) .",
    "the steeply increasing x - ray source counts of star - forming galaxies also suggest evolution .",
    "our knowledge on this key issue , however , remains sparse .",
    "theoretical models predict moderate to strong x - ray evolution for these systems at @xmath16 ( ghosh & white 2001 ) but a tight observational constraint remains to be obtained .",
    "brandt et al . ( 2001b ) studied the mean x - ray properties of bright spirals at @xmath17 using the 500ks _ chandra _ exposure of the hdf - north .",
    "they find that the mean x - ray luminosity of their sample is elevated compared to local spirals suggesting evolution consistent with the ghosh & white ( 2001 ) models .",
    "differences between the @xmath18 distribution of their sample and that of local spirals , however , may also be responsible for the observed increase .",
    "hornschemeier et al .",
    "( 2002a ) used stacking analysis to investigate the mean properties of @xmath19 spirals in the _ chandra _ deep field north .",
    "they found evidence for an increase in the mean @xmath20 ratio compared to local star - forming systems .",
    "statistical uncertainties , however , did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn",
    ".    clearly these studies , although of key significance for understanding the x - ray properties of star - forming galaxies at moderate to high redshifts , can not strongly constrain their evolution . to address this issue a number of observational challenges need to be resolved .",
    "firstly , distant starbursts are x - ray faint and therefore their detection even with the _ chandra _ and the xmm-_newton _ observatories is difficult . more importantly compiling starburst galaxy samples with well defined selection criteria over a wide redshift range",
    "is not trivial .",
    "the aim of this paper is to address these issues to provide a direct observational constraint on the x - ray evolution of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we combine data from an ultra - deep and homogeneous radio ( 1.4ghz ) survey ( the phoenix deep survey ; hopkins et al .",
    "2003 ) to the limit @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with a single deep ( 50ks ) xmm-_newton _ pointing covering an area of 30arcmin diameter .",
    "compared to previous studies this dataset , the phoenix / xmm survey , has the advantage of deep wide area @xmath0jy radio observations .",
    "such observations have been shown to be efficient in identifying actively star - forming galaxies to @xmath19 with small contamination by agns ( 1020 per cent ; georgakakis et al .",
    "1999 ; barger 2002 ; bauer et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "also , the insensitivity of radio wavelengths to dust obscuration suggests that deep radio surveys are unique for compiling starburst samples to @xmath19 with uniform selection criteria free from dust induced biases .",
    "a minor drawback of radio selection is that it may underestimate the sf activity in low luminosity galaxies ( @xmath23 ; condon et al . 1992 ; bell 2003 ; chapman et al .",
    "these systems are believed to substantially contribute to the star - formation rate density in the local universe ( e.g. wilson et al .",
    "2002 ) . keeping this caveat in mind",
    ", the phoenix / xmm survey still offers an excellent opportunity to explore the x - ray evolution of star - forming galaxies .",
    "section [ phoenix ] presents the multiwavelength data available for the phoenix deep survey , section [ xdata ] describes the x - ray data while section [ sample ] details the sample used in the present study .",
    "the stacking technique is outlined in section [ stacking ] , and the results are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "section [ agn ] argues against agn contamination of the present radio selected sample while our results are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] summarises our conclusions . for comparison with previous studies throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath24 and @xmath25 but we also give results for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 cosmology .",
    "the phoenix deep survey ( pds ) is an on - going program aiming to study the nature and the evolution of sub - mjy and @xmath28jy radio galaxies .",
    "the radio observations were carried out at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4ghz during several campaigns between 1994 and 2001 in the 6a , 6b and 6c array configurations .",
    "the data cover a 4.56 square degree area centered at ra(j2000)=@xmath29 dec.(j2000)=@xmath30 .",
    "a detailed description of the radio observations , data reduction and source detection are discussed by hopkins et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "the observational strategy adopted resulted in a radio map that is highly homogeneous within the central @xmath31 radius .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath32 rms noise increases from @xmath33 at the most sensitive region to about @xmath34 close to the field edge .",
    "the final catalogue consists of a total of 2058 radio sources to a limit of 60@xmath28jy ( @xmath22 ; hopkins et al . 2003 ) .",
    "follow - up optical photometric observations of the entire pds in the @xmath35 and @xmath36-bands were obtained at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) during two observing runs in 1994 and 1995 september .",
    "a detailed description of these observations including data reduction , photometric calibration , source extraction and optical identification are presented by georgakakis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in brief , this dataset is complete to @xmath37mag and allows optical identification of about 50 per cent of the radio sample .",
    "an on - going spectroscopic program aiming to obtain spectral information for the optically identified sources is underway using the 2df facility at the aat . at present redshifts and spectral classifications",
    "are available for over 300 sources brighter than @xmath1mag .",
    "this optical magnitude limit is the only selection applied to the radio sample for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "part of this large dataset is presented by georgakakis et al .",
    "galaxies are grouped on the basis of spectral features and diagnostic emission - line ratios into ( i ) systems exhibiting absorption - line features only , ( ii ) star - forming galaxies , ( iii ) narrow emission line seyfert 2s , ( iv ) broad line seyfert 1s and ( v ) `` unclassified '' objects .",
    "the latter have at least one narrow emission line identified in their optical spectra ( allowing redshift determination ) but the poor s / n ratio , or the small number of emission lines within the observable window , or the presence of instrumental features contaminating emission lines prevented a reliable spectral classification ( georgakakis et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a new set of high quality deep multiwavelength @xmath38 photometric data has recently been obtained for a subregion of the pds partly overlapping with the phoenix / xmm field using the wide field imager at the aat ( @xmath39-bands ) and the eso 2.2 m ( @xmath40-band ) telescopes complete to @xmath41 and @xmath42mag respectively . near - infrared ( nir ) photometric observations ( @xmath43 and @xmath44-bands ) complete to @xmath45mag have also been obtained for the 30arcmin diameter area of the phoenix / xmm survey using osiris at the ctio 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the uv , optical and nir data will be presented in a series of forthcoming papers .",
    "a subregion of the pds centered at ra(j2000)=@xmath46 ; dec.(j2000)=@xmath47 was surveyed by the xmm-_newton _ on 2002 may 5 .",
    "the observation consists of a single pointing with an exposure time of @xmath48ks . the epic ( european photon imaging camera ; strder et al . 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras were operated in full frame mode with the medium filter applied .",
    "the _ xxm - newton _ data have been analysed using the science analysis software ( sas 5.3 ) .",
    "event files for the pn and the two mos detectors have been produced using the epchain and emchain tasks of sas respectively .",
    "the event files were screened for high particle background periods by rejecting times with 0.510kev count rates higher than 20 and 6cts/100s for the pn and the two mos cameras respectively .",
    "the adopted count rates are a trade off between maximum effective exposure time and low particle background contamination .",
    "higher thresholds do not significantly increase the exposure time while lower thresholds severely reduce the effective exposure time .",
    "the pn and mos good time intervals are 39444 and 41273s respectively .",
    "the difference between the pn and the mos exposure times is due to varying start and end times of the detectors .",
    "only events corresponding to patterns 04 for the pn and 012 for two mos cameras have been kept . to increase the signal  to  noise ratio and to reach fainter fluxes the pn and the mos event files",
    "have been combined into a single event list using the merge task of sas .",
    "images in celestial coordinates with pixel size of 4.35arcsec have been extracted in the spectral bands 0.58kev ( total ) , 0.52kev ( soft ) and 28kev ( hard ) for the merged event file .",
    "events with energies below 0.5 or above 8kev are not used here because of the reduced xmm-_newton _ effective area at these energies .",
    "also , below 0.5kev the background is elevated due to the galactic x - ray emission component ( lumb et al .",
    "therefore , photons with energies @xmath49 and @xmath50kev primarily increase the background and do not improve the signal  to  noise ratio of the final image",
    ". exposure maps accounting for vignetting , ccd gaps and bad pixels have been constructed for each spectral band .",
    "source detection was independently performed in the total ( 0.58kev ) , soft ( 0.52kev ) and hard ( 28kev ) band images using the ewavelet task of sas with a significance threshold of @xmath51 .",
    "a byproduct of the source extraction algorithm is the construction of background maps for each spectral band .",
    "we detect 137 , 128 and 88 x - ray sources in the 0.5 - 8 , 0.52 28kev spectral bands respectively .",
    "the @xmath51 limiting fluxes in these spectral bands are @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "a small number of x - ray faint sources are only detected in either the soft ( total of 11 ) or the hard ( total of 9 ) bands and are missed from the total band due to the elevated background . a detailed analysis of the nature of the x - ray sources detected in the phoenix / xmm survey will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( georgakakis et al . in preparation ) . to convert counts to flux the energy conversion factors ( ecf ) of individual detectors",
    "are calculated assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath55 ( e.g. bauer et al .",
    "2002 ) and galactic absorption @xmath56 appropriate for the pds .",
    "the mean ecf for the mosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting the ecfs of individual detectors by the respective exposure time .",
    "for the encircled energy correction , accounting for the energy fraction outside the aperture within which source counts are accumulated , we adopt the calibration performed by ghizzardi ( 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "these studies use both pn and mos observations of point sources to formulate the xmm-_newton _ psf for different energies and off - axis angles .",
    "in particular , a king profile is fit to the data with parameters that are a function of both energy and off - axis angle .",
    "the encircled energy correction for the merged pn+mos image is estimated by weighting the corrections of individual detectors by the respective exposure time . in any rate",
    "the difference between the pn and mos encircled energy corrections found by ghizzardi ( 2001a , 2001b ) is negligible .",
    "a total of 204 radio sources lie within the 30arcmin diameter region covered by the phoenix / xmm survey .",
    "this field lies within the most homogeneously covered region of the pds but is offset from the most sensitive area of the radio map by about 0.30deg .",
    "therefore , the completeness limit of the radio observations in that 30arcmin diameter region is @xmath57 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a total of 82 out of the 204 radio sources have optical counterparts brighter than @xmath1mag . of the 82 sources with @xmath2mag a subsample of 31 have spectroscopic data and secure redshifts .",
    "the spectroscopic sample comprises 7 absorption - line systems likely to be e / s0 , 10 star - forming galaxies , 1 broad - line agn , 1 seyfert-2 and 12 `` unclassified '' narrow emission line sources . as discussed in section [ phoenix ] , the latter group of galaxies have poorly constrained optical spectral properties and their nature ( agn , star - formation ) remains uncertain . in the next section",
    "we discuss evidence suggesting that although some of these sources are expected to be agns , many ( especially at @xmath58 ) are likely to be starbursts .    for the remaining radio sources with @xmath2mag and no spectroscopic information ( total of 61 ) we exploit the existing broad - band data ( @xmath59 ) to estimate photometric redshifts using the hyper - z code ( bolzonella , miralles & pell 2000 ) .",
    "the hyper - z program determines the photometric redshift of a given object by fitting a set of template spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to the observed photometric data through a standard @xmath60 minimisation technique .",
    "the template rest - frame seds used here are the observed mean spectra of four different galaxy types ( e / s0 , sbc , scd , i m ) from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ) extended in the uv and ir regions using the spectral synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) with parameters selected to match the observed spectra .",
    "figure 1 compares the photometric and spectroscopic redshift estimates of the 31 objects with available spectroscopic observations .",
    "the agreement is good with @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , figure 1 shows there is a fair agreement between the observed spectral classification ( emission , absorption line ) and the galaxy type of the best fit sed ( ellipticals , spirals , irregulars ) .",
    "figure 2 , plots the photometric and spectroscopic redshift distributions of the @xmath2 radio sample .",
    "it is clear that the agreement between the two distributions is good suggesting that the photometric redshift estimates are reliable .",
    "we find that the majority of the sub - mjy sources are best fit by late - type seds in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the faint radio population is dominated by star - forming spirals .",
    "we find 65 systems with spiral / irregular type seds and 17 radio sources with elliptical best fit seds with redshifts in the range 0.052.0 and 0.050.6 respectively .",
    "the present radio selected sample also includes one broad - line agn at @xmath62 that is assigned an irregular galaxy sed and a photometric redshift of @xmath63 . despite the agreement ,",
    "the galaxy seds used here are not suitable to either estimate qso photometric redshifts or to identify such sources within the sample . in the absence of optical spectroscopy distant qsos",
    "can be identified by their unresolved optical light profile .",
    "a total of 7 radio sources have optical counterparts that are unresolved in the @xmath36-band images and are excluded from the analysis as qso candidates . in summary out of 82 radio sources with @xmath2 65 have spiral / irregular seds and 17 have e / s0 seds . of the 65 sources with spiral / irregular seds a total of 3 have unresolved optical light profiles and 1 is a spectroscopically confirmed qso . of the 17 sources with e / s0",
    "seds a total of 4 have unresolved optical light profiles .",
    "stacking methods have been extensively used in x - ray astronomy to study the mean properties ( e.g. flux , luminosity , hardness ratios ) of well defined samples of sources that are otherwise too faint at x - ray wavelengths to be individually detected ( e.g. nandra et al . 2002 ) .    in practice",
    ", the x - ray counts ( source  plus  background ) at the position of each galaxy in the sample are added excluding x - ray detected galaxies .",
    "the expected background contribution is estimated by summing the counts from regions around each source .",
    "assuming poisson statistics for the counts a significance level is estimated for the summed signal .    to determine the size of the region within which the source  plus  background counts",
    "are extracted we adopt the empirical method described by nandra et al .",
    "tests are performed in which the radius of the circular aperture within which the source  plus  background counts are summed varies ( from one trial to the next ) between 618arcsec .",
    "we find that a radius of 10arcsec maximises the significance of the stacked signal and hence this optimal extraction radius is adopted for the analysis that follows .",
    "this extraction radius is about 2.5 times the on - axis hwhm of the xmm-_newton _ psf ( hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ) . to assess the significance of the stacked signal we estimate the background from ( i ) the smooth background maps produced by the ewavelet task of sas using 20arcsec annuli centered on the sample galaxies and ( ii ) the science images by taking the average of 60 10arcsec apertures randomly positioned within annular regions centered on the positions of the sample galaxies with inner and outer radii of 20 and 100arcsec respectively . in the latter method regions close to x - ray sources ( @xmath64arcsec )",
    "are excluded to avoid contamination from x - ray detections in the background estimation .",
    "we find that the significance of the stacked signal does not depend on the background estimation method .",
    "for simplicity we use the background maps to estimate the mean background .",
    "we note that the size of the background aperture does not modify our results .    to further assess the confidence level of the stacked signal we perform extensive simulations : mock catalogs are constructed by randomising the positions of the radio sample avoiding areas close to x - ray sources ( @xmath64arcsec ) .",
    "each of the mock catalogs has the same number of sources as the real radio catalog .",
    "we then apply the stacking analysis to the mock catalogs and estimate the significance of the stacked signal in the same way as in the real catalog .",
    "this is then repeated 10000 times to get the distribution of the detection significances for the mock catalogs .",
    "this provides an estimate of the probability of getting a statistically significant stacked signal by chance .",
    "the detection confidence levels estimated from the simulations are in excellent agreement with those based on poisson statistics    in practice we have excluded from the stacking analysis galaxies that are identified with x - ray sources detected by the ewavelet task to the @xmath51 significance level .",
    "such a low detection threshold is essential to study the mean properties of x - ray weak sources , the signal of which would otherwise be diluted by brighter ones .",
    "we find 9 radio sources with x - ray counterparts within 8arcsec off the radio position : 4 of them have narrow emission - line spectra , while the rest have no spectroscopic information but their broad band colours suggest spiral galaxy seds .",
    "most of these x - ray detected radio sources have hard x - ray spectra and x - ray luminosities of @xmath65 suggesting agn activity rather than star - formation .",
    "a detailed study of these radio sources will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "moreover , counts associated with the wings of the psf of bright x - ray sources might erroneously increase the stacking signal significance .",
    "therefore , to avoid contamination of the stacking signal from nearby x - ray sources we have excluded from the analysis a total of 12 radio galaxies that lie close ( i.e. 840arcsec ) to x - ray detections . a total of 21 radio sources , either lying close to ( 12 objects ; 840arcsec ) or being associated with ( 9 objects ; @xmath66arcsec ) x - ray detections , have thus been excluded .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to explore the mean properties of star - forming sub - mjy radio galaxies .",
    "our sample is restricted to sub - mjy sources with @xmath67jy ( the flux density limit of the radio catalogue ) and spiral galaxy seds that are not associated with or do not lie close to x - ray sources .",
    "further , in the analysis that follows we use only radio sources with redshift @xmath68 , since at higher redshifts the present sample with @xmath2 becomes highly incomplete .",
    "we also exclude distant agns as explained above .",
    "the final sample used in the stacking analysis comprises 34 radio galaxies that fulfill the above criteria .",

    "using the empirical relation between x - ray absorption and optical extinction of gorenstein ( 1975 ) the above column density translates to @xmath119 .",

    "this is important especially if some of these sources are agns and thus not representative of the star - forming galaxy population studied in this paper .",
    "we explore this issue by assigning detection significances to individual radio sources and then excluding sources above a given threshold .",
