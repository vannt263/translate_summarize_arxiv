    "the cosmic web of matter gravitationally deflects the paths of photons as they traverse the universe  an effect known as gravitational lensing . in the case of light from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , these lensing deflections imprint information about the density fluctuations between the primordial universe at @xmath2 1100 and the present day onto the observed cmb sky , and in doing so modify the statistical properties of the cmb anisotropies .",

    "the total area of the overlapping , unmasked region is 121 square degrees .",
    "as the cs82 @xmath36-band imaging is deeper than the overlapping multi - color co - add data from sdss @xcite , we can not estimate a photometric redshift for each galaxy in our source catalog .",
    "however , for the purposes of this work , we do not require a photometric redshift estimate for each source galaxy .",
    "instead , only the source redshift distribution is needed to predict the amplitude of the cross - correlation .",
    "we estimate this redshift distribution using the 30-band cosmos photometric redshift catalog @xcite .",
    "we select a random sample of cosmos galaxies such that the @xmath36-band magnitude distribution of the random sample matches the cs82 source catalog .",

    "[ cs82dndz ] .",
    "there are uncertainties in our @xmath50 estimate due to sample variance in the cosmos data , errors in the cosmos photometric redshifts , and the assumed parametric form for @xmath50 . estimating these uncertainties is a nontrivial task and is beyond the scope of this paper , as the main goal of this work",
    "is simply to present the detection of the cross - correlation .",
    "nonetheless , to give some sense of the effects of uncertainty in @xmath50 , we investigate how the predicted amplitude of the cross - correlation varies when we shift the peak and the high - redshift tail of @xmath50 . for these tests , we shift the peak of @xmath50 by @xmath56 and shift the high - redshift tail of @xmath50 by varying the parameter @xmath57 by @xmath5830% .",
    "these four test cases are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ cs82dndz ] .",
    "again , we stress that these tests are not necessarily designed to represent the true underlying uncertainty in our @xmath50 estimate ( which is nontrivial to compute ) , but only to give some idea of how variations in @xmath50 can affect the predicted amplitude of the cross - correlation .    when computing the theoretical cross power spectrum with fixed cosmological parameters using eq .",
    "[ eqn : theory_eqn ] , we find that these @xmath50 variations lead to changes of order @xmath59 in the amplitude of the theory curve .",
    "the largest amplitude change occurs when shifting the tail of the source distribution to higher redshift , with the other variations leading to comparable changes .",
    "as the cmb lensing kernel @xmath24 peaks at @xmath60 with a broad tail to higher redshift , the degree of cross - correlation is quite sensitive to the tail of the source galaxy redshift distribution .",
    "clearly , the interpretation of our results depends on the assumed @xmath50 . in general",
    ", the high - redshift tail of the source redshift distribution is notoriously difficult to measure from photometric surveys .",
    "this is due in part to the lyman - balmer break degeneracy in photometric redshift codes for galaxies at @xmath61 ( which requires difficult to obtain deep near - infrared or @xmath62-band imaging to be resolved ) , but also because high - redshift galaxies are faint and thus have more unreliable photometric redshifts . in conclusion , it is clear that future measurements of this kind will need to pay particular attention to systematics associated with the source redshift distribution .",
    "we create a series of maps for the cs82 data that follow a regular grid with a pixel size of 1 arcminute and that are matched to the mosaic mask map described previously . to create shear maps",
    ", we closely follow the procedure outlined in @xcite to account for the multiplicative shear measurement bias ( @xmath49 ) and the weighting @xmath46 .",
    "a normalized ellipticity map @xmath63 is constructed for the @xmath64 component of the ellipticity by summing @xmath64 over all source galaxies within in each pixel @xmath65 and normalizing as    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the inverse variance weight and @xmath68 is the shear calibration factor associated with the @xmath69 galaxy @xcite . in a similar fashion",
    ", we also compute the following maps :    * @xmath70 : similar to @xmath71 but for the @xmath72 component of the ellipticity . * @xmath73 : similar to @xmath71 but @xmath64 is replaced by an estimate of the @xmath64 component of the psf ellipticity at galaxy position @xmath74 . *",

    "we also create a set of 500 random maps for each component of the ellipticity . in these maps , the position of each galaxy is preserved , but for each realization , we rotate source galaxies by a random position angle .",
    "this process ensures that the maps have the same shape noise as the cs82 ellipticity maps but do not contain a cosmological shear signal .",
    "we use these random maps for null tests in cross - correlation with the true act data ( see section [ sect : results ] ) .    finally , as discussed in @xcite , 25% of the cfht legacy survey fields have a significant psf residual and are rejected for cosmic shear studies @xcite . however ,",
    "this cross - correlation analysis should be much less sensitive to psf - related errors in comparison to cosmic shear measurements because cs82 psf patterns should be uncorrelated with the act cmb lensing signal .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that it was not necessary to reject these fields .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible that the psf pattern correlates with the act signal simply by chance .",
    "the @xmath79 maps are designed to test and rule out this possibility ( see the discussion of null tests in section [ sect : results ] ) .",
    "the cross - correlation of the act cmb lensing and cs82 galaxy lensing convergence fields is computed in fourier space .",
    "the choice to reconstruct the correlation in fourier space rather than real space was made in order to limit correlations between different data bins , which can complicate the interpretation of the final measurement .",
    "furthermore , this method minimizes the total number of fourier transforms needed , which reduces noise due to windowing and edge effects . in order to obtain an unbiased estimate of the cross spectrum",
    ", we follow a procedure similar to the steps outlined in previous act power spectrum analyses @xcite , which properly account for the coupling of fourier modes induced by filtering and windowing effects .",
    "the notation and terminology in this section closely follows that of these previous act analyses .",
    "first , the real space act convergence map is repixelized to match the resolution ( 1 arcminute ) of the cs82 data . then",
    ", the act data and cs82 ellipticity maps are spatially divided into two noncontiguous patches on which the cross spectrum estimation is computed separately .",
    "the two patches are divided at zero right ascension due to a coincidental discontinuity in the cs82 imaging at this location .",
    "this divides the original map into two roughly equal area patches .",
    "we denote the separate patches with greek indices , such that patch @xmath80 of the two cs82 ellipticity maps at position @xmath81 is denoted as @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , patch @xmath80 of the repixelized act convergence map is denoted as @xmath84 .",
    "both the cs82 and act data patches are multiplied in real space by a tapering function and the cs82 mask map , which masks out image artifacts and bright point sources .",
    "the tapering function minimizes noise introduced by the patch edges in fourier space .",
    "it is generated by convolving a map that is unity in the center and zero over 10 pixels at the edges with a gaussian of full width at half maximum of @xmath85 .",
    "the window function in real space is the product of these two components  the tapering function and the cs82 mask . in the following discussion , the window function",

    "as expected , the measurement is consistent with null signal , with @xmath143 for five degrees of freedom , corresponding to a 55% probability that the chi - squared of random noise would exceed the measured value .",

    "[ fig : cs82_nulls ] shows the correlation between the act data and the psf data .",
    "the result is also consistent with zero , with @xmath144 and a probability to exceed of 13% .",
    "the error bars for both spectra are computed from monte carlo estimates , as done previously .",
    "we have cross - correlated cmb lensing and galaxy lensing convergence maps and measured the lensing - lensing cross power spectrum for the first time  at @xmath0 significance .",
    "this cross - power is a direct gravitational measurement of the distribution of mass at redshifts @xmath1 0.9 .",
    "the measurement constrains the amplitude of structure to an uncertainty of @xmath112% , although contamination from galaxy intrinsic alignments and errors in the @xmath50 must be carefully considered for more precise cosmological constraints .",
    "our method is remarkably robust to instrumental and astrophysical systematic errors .",
    "it is performed with a cross - correlation of mass measurements relying on completely different measurement techniques and photon wavelengths , which few systematics can survive . despite the moderate detection significance",
    ", this robustness makes a first measurement of this cross - correlation signal a valuable confirmation of the @xmath3cdm model for large - scale structure at intermediate redshifts .    in just the next few years",
    ", measurements of lensing - lensing cross - correlations are expected to increase in signal - to - noise by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "cmb lensing - galaxy lensing cross - correlations have the potential to greatly contribute to cosmology in two main ways .",
    "first , they can serve as a calibrator of instrumental systematics , which may potentially limit future optical and infrared weak lensing surveys . by adding information from lensing - lensing cross - correlations to weak lensing power spectra ,",
    "additive and multiplicative biases can be precisely constrained , which will allow future weak lensing surveys to reach their full cosmological potential ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , they will serve as an independent , robust measurement of the amplitude of structure at intermediate redshifts .",
    "when combined with probes at higher redshift ( e.g. , cmb lensing ) and lower redshift ( e.g , weak lensing ) , lensing - lensing cross - correlations will help measure the growth of structure across a wide range of redshifts .",
    "this , in turn , will allow for powerful constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and the properties of dark energy .",
