    "the perturbation theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been very successful in interpreting and predicting high energy scattering processes . with new data from fermilab run ii and the lhc in the near future , we expect to test qcd to a new level of accuracy , and also expect that a better understanding of qcd will underpin precision tests of the electroweak interactions and particle searches beyond the standard model @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the description of vector and scalar boson production properties , in particular their transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) distribution , is likely to be one of the most intensively investigated topics at both fermilab and the lhc , especially in the context of higgs searches .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the predictive power of qcd perturbation theory for the transverse momentum distributions of vector and scalar boson production in hadronic collisions .",
    "the production of vector bosons ( @xmath7 , and @xmath5 ) with invariant mass @xmath8 at large and small @xmath1 in hadronic collisions has been extensively studied @xcite . when @xmath9 , effectively , there is only one hard momentum scale in the production .",
    "therefore , we expect the fixed - order perturbative calculations in power series of @xmath10 to be reliable @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the production of vector bosons at small transverse momenta : @xmath11 , where the bulk of the data is .",
    "the small @xmath1 region also corresponds to a phase space that is most relevant to the hadronic higgs production .",
    "when @xmath12 , the @xmath1 distributions calculated order - by - order in @xmath10 in the conventional fixed - order perturbation theory receive a large logarithm , @xmath13 , at every power of @xmath10 . even at the leading order in @xmath10 , the cross section @xmath14 contains a term proportional to @xmath15 coming from the partonic subprocess : @xmath16 . beyond the leading order , we can actually get two powers of the logarithm for every power of @xmath10 , due to soft and collinear gluons emitted by the incoming partons .",
    "therefore , at sufficiently small @xmath1 , the convergence of the conventional perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath10 is impaired , and the logarithms must be resummed .",
    "resummation of the large logarithms in qcd can be carried out either in @xmath1-space directly , or in the impact parameter , @xmath0-space , which is a fourier conjugate of the @xmath1-space .",
    "it was first shown by dokshitzer , diakonov and troyan ( ddt ) that in the double leading logarithm approximation ( ddla ) , which corresponds to the phase space where the radiated gluons are both soft and collinear with strong ordering in their transverse momenta , the dominant contributions in the small @xmath1 region can be resummed into a sudakov form factor @xcite .",
    "however , the strong ordering in transverse momenta in the ddla overly constrains the phase space of the emitted soft gluons and ignores the overall momentum conservation . as a result , the ddt resummation formalism unphysically suppresses the @xmath1 distributions at small @xmath1 @xcite . by imposing the transverse momentum conservation without assuming the strong ordering in transverse momenta of radiated gluons , parisi and petronzio introduced the @xmath0-space resummation method which allows resummation of some subleading logarithms @xcite . by using the renormalization group equation technique",
