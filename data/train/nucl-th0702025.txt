    "external probes are valuable tools for testing the properties of plasmas . in relativistic heavy ion physics hard qcd processes and electromagnetic processes",
    "take this role and are are supposed to unravel the secrets of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "indeed the first round of experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) found impressive evidence for jet quenching , a dramatic energy loss of the leading jet particle @xcite .",
    "our interpretation of such results relies on the assumptions we make about the applicability of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the view that momentum transfers of 1 to 2 gev/@xmath0 are sufficient is supported by the success of next - to - leading order pqcd calculations for @xmath1 collisions at rhic energies .",
    "however the answer does depend heavily on the process under consideration .",
    "indeed we have now firm experimental evidence that in au+au collisions at rhic most hadrons are not produced from the usual jet fragmentation mechanism up to rather high transverse momenta @xmath2 gev/@xmath0 .",
    "this makes perturbative hadron production an even rarer process than most of us expected .",
    "we want to call hadron production perturbative if it originates from fragmentation of a jet . of course jets",
    "interact heavily with the surrounding medium . in the past",
    "it was often assumed that the quenching leads to a reshuffling of energy within the jet cone or a transfer of energy from the jet into the medium without completely destroying the jet . as it turns out ,",
    "the number of hadrons from surviving jets at intermediate @xmath3 is drowned out by the number of hadrons hadronizing from the bulk fireball via recombination of quarks @xcite .",
    "the hints from experimental data can be divided into three categories .",
    "first , one - particle inclusive hadron spectra show that the chemical composition of the hadrons produced between a @xmath3 of 2 and 6 gev/@xmath0 is not compatible with jet fragmentation .",
    "most notable is the enhancement of baryons as seen in the missing suppression of the nuclear modification factors @xmath4 for baryons and in the various anomalously large baryon / meson ratios @xcite .",
    "these results already hint toward a chemically equilibrated source of these hadrons .",
    "second , the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath5 follows to very good accuracy a scaling law with respect to the number of valence quarks @xcite .",
    "this is very direct evidence that the observable @xmath5 is shaped in a deconfined quark phase .",
    "a third emerging group of data involves dihadron correlations or associated hadron yields .",
    "this data is much more difficult to describe ( in any model ) than the single hadron spectra .",
    "although jet - like correlations are present at intermediate transverse momenta , the shape of these correlations and the chemical composition can differ strongly from the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 meson has long been discussed as a good test for the validity of the recombination model @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 mesons are as heavy as protons but data from rhic now impressively confirm that the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor are very similar to those for kaons @xcite",
    ". we can now be very sure that the meson vs baryon signature at intermediate @xmath3 is very robust and can neither be explained by an extrapolation of hydrodynamics nor by perturbative jet production and fragmentation .",
    "in central heavy ion collisions a hot and dense fireball of deconfined quarks and gluons is created . in the recombination model one",
    "postulates the existence of thermalized parton degrees of freedom at the phase transition temperature @xmath7 which recombine or coalesce into hadrons .",
    "it has been found to be sufficient to consider the lowest fock state in each hadron , the valence quarks , which are given constituent masses around 300 mev .",
    "the spectrum of hadrons can be calculated starting from a convolution of wigner functions @xcite . for a meson with valence ( anti)quarks @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "we have @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the 2-particle wigner function for partons @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 is the wigner function of the meson .",
    "the sum runs over all possible parton quantum numbers . for simplicity",
    "the parton wigner function is usually approximated by a product of single particle phase space distributions @xmath13 .",
    "several slightly different implementations of this formalism have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for earlier reviews .",
    "a very good description of hadron spectra and hadron ratios measured at rhic can be achieved by combining hadron production from recombination for intermediate transverse momentum with a perturbative calculation using fragmentation and energy loss in the medium @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows the @xmath3 spectrum of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in central au+au collisions obtained in @xcite .",
    "the agreement with data is very good for @xmath18 gev/@xmath0 .",
    "we note that the hadron spectra exhibit an exponential shape up to about 4 gev/@xmath0 for mesons and up to about 6 gev/@xmath0 for baryons , where recombination of thermal quarks dominates . above",
    ", the spectra follow a power - law and production is dominated by fragmentation .",
    "let us now assume the parton phase exhibits elliptic flow @xmath19 .",
    "recombination makes a prediction for elliptic flow of any hadron species after recombination which is precisely the scaling law mentioned before @xcite @xmath20 involving the number @xmath21 of valence quarks of the hadron .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] shows the measured elliptic flow @xmath5 for several hadron species in a plot with scaled axes @xmath22 vs @xmath23 .",
    "all data points ( with exception of the pions ) fall on one universal curve . the effect that pions are shifted to lower @xmath3 has been understood @xcite .",
    "the quark scaling law is an impressive confirmation of the recombination model .",
    "it shows that the relevant degrees of freedom at early times in the collision are partons and it proves that these partons behave collectively .",
    "it is an interesting question to ask to which accuracy one expects the scaling law for elliptic flow to hold .",
    "in particular , are the scaling factors of 2 and 3 indeed excluding any higher fock states in the hadrons ?",
    "a recent study found that higher fock states in an expansion @xmath24 could actually be accommodated @xcite .",
    "this is in fact trivial for the single - hadron yields from a thermal parton spectrum .",
    "they do not change if additional partons are allowed to coalesce .",
    "the situation changes for elliptic flow .",
    "higher fock states with @xmath21 partons come with their own scaling factor @xmath21 which seems to destroy the scaling with the number of valence quarks .",
    "however a numerical evaluation shows that the correction is surprisingly small .",
    "[ fig : hf ] shows the expected violation of the scaling law using the new asymmetry variable @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the _ scaled _ elliptic flow of a meson and a baryon respectively @xcite .",
    "generally the violations are smaller than 5% .",
    "new data from star analyzes scaling violations in the data and finds them to have the predicted sign and order of magnitude @xcite . after this study",
    "it is clear that there is some room to accommodate gluons or sea quarks during the recombination process .",
    "further investigations in this direction are necessary .",
    "one crucial simplification implemented so far is a factorization of any @xmath21-parton wigner function into a product of independent single parton distributions @xmath28 . by definition",
    "this factorization does not permit any correlations between partons .",
    "consequently , no hadron correlations can emerge via recombination .",
    "originally this factorization was chosen for simplicity and it was justified because single inclusive hadron spectra could be described very well .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that modifications of this factorization including correlations between partons lead to correlations between hadrons after recombination .",
    "the quality of the single hadron spectra does not suffer .",
    "the source of jet - like correlations in the qgp is the strong coupling of jets to the medium .",
    "the energy loss is estimated to be up to 14 gev / fm for a 10 gev parton @xcite .",
    "quenched jets lead to a considerable local heating and create a hot spot inside the fireball .",
    "moreover , the directional information of the jet is preserved .",
    "partons of such a hot spot exhibit jet - like correlations .",
    "the next oder extension of the correlation - free factorization in @xcite assumes that correlations still are a small effect and that one can restrict them to 2-particle correlations @xmath29 ( see also @xcite ) . then",
    "a 4-parton wigner function can be written @xmath30 the correlation functions @xmath29 between parton @xmath31 and parton @xmath32 are non - vanishing only in a subvolume @xmath33 of the fireball .",
    "a gaussian ansatz @xmath34 is chosen to describe correlations in azimuthal angle .",
    "the 2-meson yield is given by a convolution of the partonic wigner function @xmath35 with the wigner functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 of the mesons with an additional integration over the hadronization hypersurface @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the correlation strength @xmath38 which permits omitting quadratic terms like @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "we can now study the associated yield @xmath41 for a trigger hadron @xmath42 in a given kinematic window as a function of the relative azimuthal angle @xmath43 between the two .",
    "one finds @xmath44 the @xmath45 are single particle yields in the kinematic window of the trigger meson or associated meson and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the hadronization volume .",
    "the factor @xmath48 ( for two mesons ) indicates an enhancement of the correlations in the hadron phase compared to the parton phase .",
    "the effect is similar to the amplification of elliptic flow by the number @xmath21 of valence quarks .",
    "@xmath49 counts the number of possible correlated pairs between the @xmath50 ( anti)quarks of meson @xmath42 and the @xmath51 ( anti)quarks of meson @xmath26 . in the weak correlation limit",
    "only single correlations are counted .",
    "apparently one has @xmath52 thus @xmath53 for a meson - baryon pair and @xmath54 for a baryon - baryon pair .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the associated yield of hadrons integrated in azimuthal angle around the near side ( @xmath55 ) for the case that the trigger is a baryon ( proton or antiproton ) and a meson ( pion or kaon ) for different centralities .",
    "the kinematic window is 2.5 gev/@xmath564.0 gev/@xmath0 for trigger particles and 1.7 gev/@xmath572.5 gev/@xmath0 for associated particles , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig : res ] shows the associated yield with only fragmentation , and fragmentation and recombination both taken into account together with phenix data @xcite .",
    "a good description of the data can be reached assuming a constant correlation volume .",
    "the parameters used for the fireball are the same that lead to a good description of single hadron spectra and elliptic flow @xcite .",
