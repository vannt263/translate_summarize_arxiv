    "feynman integrals in dimensional regularization in @xmath2 dimensions are invariant under poincar transformations . by applying these transformations at the integrand - level , one obtains nontrivial linear relations among different integrals , the integration - by - parts @xcite relations .",
    "these relations can be used to reduce the large number of feynman integrals relevant to a particular process to a much smaller number of so - called master integrals .",
    "this reduction is typically carried out using a lexicographic ordering of the integrals  @xcite , implemented in computer algebra routines , for example in the codes @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the type of master integrals that appear in a given process depends only on the external kinematics , and on possible internal propagator masses .",
    "all two - loop five - parton amplitudes relate to a common set of master integrals : massless on - shell five - point functions at two loops .",
    "these can be further classified into genuine five - point functions , four - point functions with one off - shell leg , three - point functions with up to two off - shell legs and off - shell two - point functions .",
    "up to the four - point level , these functions appeared in the context of the derivation of the two - loop amplitude for @xmath3  jets  @xcite and were already computed long ago  @xcite .",
    "the genuine five - point functions depend on five independent mandelstam invariants , @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "they are therefore considerably more complicated than the four - point functions , since the latter depend on three variables only .",

    "the latter reproduces a contribution from the helicity - violating one - loop splitting function @xmath49 .",

    "it is tempting to treat the latter in the same way as the loop integration variable in the discussion of one - loop maximally helicity violating amplitudes in @xcite .",
    "this defines a kinematical region where in particular @xmath53 and @xmath54<0 $ ] ( and cyclic ) .",
    "interestingly , in this region , @xmath55 is positive ( and the same holds for its @xmath56-point generalization @xcite ) . at two loops , we find that all terms are positive , except for the terms involving @xmath57 , which are negative",
    ". this can be seen by noting that @xmath58 is a one - loop one - mass box function in six dimensions .",
    "it could be that the positivity properties at two loops are obscured by the infrared subtraction ; see eq .",
    "( [ definitionremainder ] ) . however , one may speculate that the natural building blocks of definite sign that we found above point towards additional structure that is yet to be uncovered .",
    "our result for the planar master integrals provides the maximal set of polylogarithmic functions that can appear in a generic planar massless five - particle scattering amplitude at two loops .",
    "therefore we reduce the calculation of any such scattering amplitude to the determination of the algebraic coefficients accompanying the integral basis .",
    "this can be envisioned using a variety of related methods @xcite . in the one - loop case ,",
    "the knowledge of the integral basis triggered a revolution in our ability to compute amplitudes , and we expect the same to occur here .",
    "we would also like to mention that our result for the functional basis provides the foundation for bootstrap techniques to be used , where one makes an ansatz for the remainder function of the type @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are members of the functional basis , and @xmath61 are certain kinematic - dependent factors .",
    "see @xcite for applications of such a bootstrap approach to six - point amplitudes in @xmath24 sym . in the latter theory ,",
    "the kinematic dependence of the @xmath61 is related , at least conjecturally , to leading singularities @xcite , simplifying the above ansatz .",
    "we anticipate that the basis of pentagon functions that we provide will be useful for bootstrapping generic five - point amplitudes , especially when combined with an improved understanding of the possible algebraic coefficients that are allowed to appear in qcd .",
    "an obvious next step consists in calculating the loop integrals in the nonplanar case ( the method for finding an appropriate integral basis @xcite does not rely on planarity ) and applying them to the all - plus loop integrand that was found very recently @xcite .",
    "further generalizations include making one of the external legs off - shell , where we anticipate chen iterated integrals to play an even more important role than in the present work .",
    "this will allow to describe processes such as the production of higgs boson plus jets at nnlo .",
    "we would like to thank simon badger for numerous discussions and for providing the numerical routines of  @xcite , which were used to validate our results . the expression ( [ resultf5nice ] ) for the finite remainder agrees with the very recent result of  @xcite , which uncovered a typo in the original version of our manuscript .",
