    ", they are able to capture some of the well - known features of the implied volatility surface , such as the volatility smile and skew . while some single - factor diffusion stochastic volatility models such as heston s @xcite , enjoy wide success due to the existence of semi - analytic pricing formula for european options , it is known that such models are not adequate to match implied volatility levels across all strikes and maturities ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "numerous empirical studies have identified at least a fast time scale in stock price volatility on the order of days , as well as a slow scale on the order of months , for example @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the development of multiscale stochastic volatility models , in which instantaneous volatility levels are controlled by multiple driving factors running on different time scales .",
    "a class of multiscale stochastic volatility models is analyzed in @xcite , where an approximation for european options and their induced implied volatilities is derived , which can capture the overall level of implied volatility , its skew across strike prices and its term - structure over a wide range of maturities .",
    "however , the analysis there is limited to a first order approximation , which can not pick up the slight convexity of the observed equity implied volatility surface . in this paper",
    "we extend the results of @xcite to second order .",

    "additionally , we are able to maintain analytic tractability which is important for calibration to data , as we demonstrate . of course",
    ", numerous asymptotic regimes have been analyzed in recent years for the option pricing problem in incomplete markets : see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for some references . here",
    "our focus is not just on deriving and proving convergence of the approximation in the appropriate limits , but in disentangling the calibration procedure that results from it .",
    "compared to the first order theory , this is much more involved as there are many more group parameters and basis functions that have to be accommodated to implied volatility data .",
    "despite the increase in complexity , we show this can be implemented successfully .",
    "the rest of this paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we describe the class of multiscale stochastic volatility models that we will work with . using a formal singular and regular perturbation analysis",

    "we establish the accuracy of our pricing approximation in theorems [ thm : accuracy ] and [ thm : call ] , where we use a regularization to handle the non smooth ` kink ' of call and put option payoffs . in section [ sec : volatilities ] , we present an explicit formula for the implied volatility surface induced by our option pricing approximation . additionally , we show how a parameter reduction , crucial for calibration purpose , can be achieved with no loss of accuracy . in section [ sec : calibration ] , we outline a procedure for calibrating the class of multiscale stochastic volatility models to the empirically observed implied volatility surface of liquid calls and puts .",
