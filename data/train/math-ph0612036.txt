    "so , at time @xmath9 we have two electromagnetic field configurations denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which , of course , have _ compact support _ in a region @xmath12 @xmath13 ( the rest space of the inertial frame ) and which we suppose are moving in opposite directions ( to fix the ideas the @xmath14-direction ) .",
    "we suppose moreover that the two antennas are separated by a distance @xmath15 , which means that one does not affect the other during the time they are generating the  arbitrary electromagnetic field configurations @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these fields can then be taken as cauchy data for maxwell equations and at any time @xmath16 satisfy maxwell equation is the equation of motion for an electromagnetic field configuration @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the clifford bundle of differential forms .",

    "the statement about non conservation of energy - momentum is also done by the author of @xcite who says that results of recent experiments @xcite endorse his statement .",
    "in @xcite the double slit interference with monochromatic waves ] is analyzed and it is said that energy - momentum is conserved only _ after _ spatial average . on the other hand ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite  shows that eq.([thesis ] ) is the correct one for the case of two _ plane _ waves moving in opposite directions , but since waves of this kind ( which do not have compact support ) have infinite energy when the integration in eq.([em12 ] ) is done in all space , his approach can not in any way be considered satisfactory . in @xcite",

    "<S> in this paper we prove in a rigorous mathematical way ( using the clifford bundle formalism ) that the energies and momenta of two _ distinct _ and _ arbitrary _ free maxwell fields ( of finite energies and momenta ) that are superposed are additive and thus that there is _ no _ incompatibility between the principle of superposition of fields and the principle of energy - momentum conservation , contrary to some recent claims . </S>",
