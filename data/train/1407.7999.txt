    "sleep slow oscillations ( sos ) of @xmath1hz hallmark slow - wave sleep ( sws ) as they are the largest oscillatory events ( amplitude @xmath2v ) recorded in the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) .",
    "they emerge from highly synchronized cortical neuronal networks undergoing alternations between phases of membrane depolarization together with higher firing activity ( up states ) and phases of hyperpolarized membrane potentials and neural quiescence ( down states ; sanchez - vives and mccormick , 2000 ; steriade et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "sos have been likewise observed in diverse animal species and humans ( achermann and borbely , 1997 ; mlle et al . , 2002 ;",
    "rattenborg et al . , 2011 ; steriade , 2006 ) .",
    "a large number of studies have demonstrated different functions of the so , the most important of which is their role in the consolidation of long - term memory ( diekelmann and born , 2010 ; mlle and born , 2011 ) , and their role in the homeostatic regulation of synaptic connectivity ( tononi and cirelli , 2006 ) .",
    "the established functional importance of sos has attracted growing interest regarding their manipulation in terms of both enhancement and suppression ( landsness et al . , 2009 ;",
    "marshall et al . , 2006 ; van der werf et al . ,",
    "the former requires a possibility to trigger sos , which has been successfully attempted using transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ; marshall et al .",
    ", 2006 ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( massimini et al . , 2007 ) or intracranial electrical stimulation ( vyazovskiy et al . , 2009 )",
    ". rhythmic sensory stimulation , to the best of our knowledge , has not been tested as a tool to induce sos in humans , although acoustic stimuli are well known to induce k - complexes , which are considered a forerunner of the so ( cash et al . , 2009 ; de gennaro et al . , 2000",
    "; riedner et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "based on this evidence and because of the simplicity of the approach , here we probed the capacity of rhythmic stimulation in the 0.8-hz so frequency to induce sos in the human brain .",
    "of particular interest was whether such regular stimulation had the capability to entrain endogenous so rhythms to an external drive .",
    "effects were tested while subjects were awake , transited into sleep and during stable non - rapid eye movement ( nonrem ) sleep . of additional interest",
    "was the question whether rhythmic 0.8-hz stimulation would accelerate onset of sleep and sws .",
    "a similar effect was achieved in a previous work by instrumental conditioning of the sensorimotor rhythm ( hoedlmoser et al .",
    "basically , starting the stimulation already during wakefulness before sleep also enabled a comparison between the effects of the stimulation between wakefulness and sleep , which should reveal clues as to a possible brain state dependence of the stimulation effects .",
    "ten healthy subjects ( seven females , three males ; mean age = 22.3 @xmath3 1.0 years ; range = 1826 years ) participated in the experiments .",
    "all participants were non - smokers , and were not using any medication at the time of the experiment .",
    "prior screening ensured no history of neurological or psychiatric disease .",
    "participants were not allowed to ingest alcohol on the day before experimental nights , and were asked to refrain from caffeine 8 h before the scheduled sleeping time . moreover ,",
    "they were instructed to get up at 07:00 hours and not to take a nap during these days .",
    "prior to the experiments , subjects were accustomed to sleeping under laboratory conditions during an adaptation night , including eeg recordings and wearing of headphones ( but without any stimulation ) .",
    "the experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the university of lubeck , and subjects gave written informed consent prior to participation .",
    "each subject was studied according to a within - subject design on three experimental conditions ( 0.8-hz stimulation , random stimulation , and sham ) , with the respective experimental nights separated by at least 5 days .",
    "the order of conditions was balanced across participants . in the 0.8-hz stimulation condition",
    "sound bursts were presented with a constant interstimulus interval ( isi ) of 1.25 s , corresponding to a frequency of 0.8 hz as an approximate to the so frequency . in the random stimulation condition , sounds occurred randomly , with isis ranging from 0.125 to 5 s , excluding intervals between 0.5 and 2 s in order not to overlap with effects of the 0.8-hz stimulation .",
    "random isis were generated such that the average isi was also 1.25 s in this condition , and that in both stimulation conditions the same total number of sounds ( n = 4416 ) was presented ( which implies a higher amount of short isis during the random stimulation condition ) .",
    "acoustic stimulation commenced 2 min before lights were turned off ( at 23:00 hours ) . during this 2-min interval subjects lied in bed with eyes open fixating a point at the ceiling .",
    "after lights off , subjects were allowed to sleep and acoustic stimulation continued for a further 90 min .",
    "the sham control condition comprised periodic acoustic presentation only within the 2 min prior to lights off .",
    "the eeg was continuously recorded throughout the whole night until 07:00 hours , when the participants were awakened .",
    "the stimuli were bursts of pink @xmath4 noise of 50 ms duration , with a 5-ms rising and falling time , respectively .",
    "pink instead of white noise was used because it sounds softer and is therefore more comfortable to hear .",
    "sound volume was measured and calibrated prior to each experimental night using a voltcraft sound level meter sl-400 ( conrad electronic se , hirschau , germany ) to 60 db spl , measured directly at the in - ear headphone .",
    "stimuli were presented binaurally via rp - hje170 in - ear headphones ( philips , amsterdam , the netherlands ) .",
    "the eeg was recorded with a neurofax eeg-9200 ( nihon kohden , tokyo , japan ) from 19 channels ( extended 1020 system , fp1 , fp2 , f7 , f3 , fz , f4 , f8 , t3 , c3 , cz , c4 , t4 , t5 , p3 , pz , p4 , t6 , o1 , o2 ) referenced to c3 and c4 using an easycap ( easycap gmbh , herrsching , germany ) and ag- agcl ring electrodes .",
    "impedances were kept @xmath55 k@xmath6 .",
    "signals were filtered between 0.08 and 120 hz and offline re - referenced to the averaged signal from mastoid electrodes ( m1 , m2 ) .",
    "vertical and horizontal eye movements ( veog , heog ) as well as electromyogram from the chin ( emg ) were obtained for standard polysomnography and for artefact detection .",
    "all recordings were sampled at 500 hz and stored for later offline analyses .",
    "electroencephalogram ( at c3 and c4 ) , electrooculogram ( eog ) and emg recordings were used for offline scoring of sleep by two experienced raters who were blinded with regard to the experimental condition .",
    "scoring was done for subsequent 30-s recording epochs according to standard criteria ( rechtschaffen and kales , 1968 ) .",
    "total sleep time and time spent in the different sleep stages ( wake ; sleep stages 14 ; sws , i.e. sum of sleep stages 3 and 4 ; rem sleep ) were determined for the total nights as well as for the 90-min periods of acoustic stimulation ( and for corresponding periods of the sham condition ) .",
    "also , sleep onset latency ( first occurrence of stage 1 sleep followed by stage 2 sleep , with reference to lights off ) and latency of sws and rem sleep ( with reference to sleep onset ) were determined .",
    "prior to scoring , the eeg and both eog channels were low - pass filtered at 30 hz , and emg channels were high - pass filtered at 5 hz .",
    "stimuli evoking arousals or awakenings ( as judged by visual inspection ) were marked in order to discard them from averaging analyses .",
    "analyses were performed with spike2 software version 7 ( cambridge electronic design , cambridge , uk ) and brain vision analyser 2 ( brainproducts , munich , germany ) .",
    "all eeg signals were pre - filtered between 0.15 and 30 hz . beginning with the 2-min wake interval before lights off , a fast fourier transformation ( hanning window , 16 384 data points ) was calculated on a 33-s window that was moved in 10-s steps in time for a total of 32 min .",

    "the eeg signals were averaged with reference to stimulus onset . for the random stimulation condition ,",
    "stimuli were additionally divided into ` overlapping ' and ` non - overlapping ' stimuli , depending on whether or not the stimulus was separated by more than 1.25 s from the previous and following stimulus . as the non - overlapping category included the lowest absolute number of stimuli , for respective comparisons stimulus subsets of equal size were randomly drawn from the category of overlapping stimuli as well as from the set of stimuli in the 0.8-hz stimulation condition .",
    "signals were averaged for a 1.2-s window including a 0.1-s pre - stimulus onset baseline . to normalize responses ,",
    "the average potential during this baseline was set to zero . in the same way",
    ", slow and fast spindle activities were averaged with reference to stimulus onset . prior to this analysis",
    "the eeg signal was filtered in the respective frequency bands ( 912 hz , 1215 hz ) , down - sampled to 100 hz , and the root mean square signal was determined .",
    "the baseline normalization was performed as described for aeps .",
    "analyses of sos were restricted to periods of sws during the 90-min stimulation period and during the corresponding period of the sham condition .",
    "offline detection of sos was performed in all eeg channels according to a custom - made algorithm described previously ( mlle et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "in brief , the eeg was band - pass filtered between 0.15 and 30 hz , and down - sampled to 100 hz . for the identification of large sos a low - pass filter of 3.5",
    "hz was applied .",
    "then , negative and positive peak potentials were derived from all intervals between consecutive positive - to - negative zero crossings ( i.e. one negative and one positive peak between two succeeding positive - to - negative zero crossings ) . only intervals with durations of 0.82",

    "thus , in light of the fact that the increase in so power during the 0.8-hz stimulation condition was not statistically different from that of random stimulation , it could be argued that these effects on so power were mainly driven by evoked k - complexes to the sounds rather than by an entrainment to the rhythmic 0.8-hz stimulation . to clarify this issue , we analysed aeps that indeed revealed that for stimuli presented during random stimulation with short ( ` overlapping ' isis , the late negative - to - positive component complex bearing great similarity with the so was significantly smaller than in the aep to the stimuli presented at 0.8 hz , likely reflecting the refractoriness of the aep response with short isis ( durrant and boston , 2006 ) . also , aeps averaged across all sounds of the random stimulation condition revealed on average smaller component amplitudes than in the 0.8-hz stimulation condition , especially during sleep stage 2 . however , parallel analysis of evoked fast spindle activity revealed that the observed increase in so activity during the 0.8-hz stimulation condition can not be entirely reduced to k - complexes ( evoked at this specific isi ) .",
    "k - complexes are typically associated with a transitory increase in fast spindle activity ( contreras and steriade , 1995 ) . in fact , such an increase was observed in response to the sounds ( about 900 ms post - stimulus ) during random stimulation , with this increase significantly exceeding that during 0.8-hz stimulation . by contrast , in the 0.8-hz stimulation condition the suppression of fast spindle activity during the preceding hyperpolarization of the aep ( 300600 ms post - stimulus ) predominated ( figs 4 and s1 ) .",
    "thus , whereas isolated random stimuli caused a steady increase in fast spindle activity over the entire 1.1-s post - stimulus interval , the sounds of the 0.8-hz stimulation condition produced a phase - dependent modulation of fast spindle activity quite similar to that observed during spontaneous sos ( mlle and born , 2011 ; mlle et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , similar to the temporal pattern during spontaneous sos , also slow spindle activity during the 0.8-hz stimulation condition ( during stage 2 sleep ) was significantly increased at the transition of the aep into the negative phase ( @xmath0300 ms post - stimulus ; mlle et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "this differential patterning of fast and slow spindle activity , which is specifically observed during the 0.8-hz stimulation condition and which closely mimics the temporal relationships between slow and fast spindles during spontaneous sos , strongly argues for the view that factors other than k - complexes significantly contribute to the entrainment of so activity observed during 0.8-hz stimulation .",
    "the effect on so amplitude per se being only of moderate size might reflect habituation concurrently developing with the periodic signal presentation . in demonstrating that rhythmic acoustic stimulation can induce and entrain sleep sos ,",
    "our data suggest the use of this approach in the study of functions known to be promoted by sos , such as the consolidation of memory and the post - sleep facilitation of encoding of new memories ( d antonenko , s diekelmann , c olsen , j born and m mlle , 2012 , submitted ; marshall et al . , 2006 ; van der werf et al . , 2009 )",
    "such studies may reveal the induction of trains of sos to be more critical for memory processes than mere changes in so amplitude ( mlle et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "a main finding of our study is that the efficacy of 0.8-hz stimulation is state dependent .",
    "so power was enhanced by the rhythmic stimulation only after stable nonrem sleep stage 2 had become manifest .",
    "no similar effects were obtained during waking before sleep , and the tone stimulation also did not shorten sleep latency , which diverges from a previous study ( bohlin , 1971 ) , although that study used much longer isis ( varying between 20 and 40 s ) . a comparable dependency of the effects of tone stimulation on the brain state has been shown for the aep showing characteristic changes in its waveform ( and frequency content ) when the brain transits from wakefulness to light sleep and sws ( campbell and colrain , 2002 ; cote , 2002 ) .",
    "here we revealed a brain state dependence specifically in terms of predominant eeg rhythm .",
    "the failure of 0.8-hz stimulation to increase so activity in the waking brain , when the eeg is dominated by faster frequencies , together with significant delay of sleep onset resulting from the periodic 0.8-hz stimulation implies that the brain s susceptibility to an external drive is highly sensitive to its current state of vigilance .",
    "wakefulness either does not allow an entrainment per se , or this specific brain state is characterized by a resonance frequency disjoint to the 0.8-hz stimulation , which explains the delayed transition into sleep stage 1 as the system s dynamics are perturbed .",
    "the idea of a resonance effect induced by 0.8-hz stimulation is in particular coherent with the finding of higher accumulation of so power after sws was reached .",
    "however , although suggesting a brain state dependency of the stimulation effect , our data do not entirely rule out that other factors , like circadian rhythm , added to the effects of 0.8-hz stimulation on eeg activity occurring selectively during sleep .",
    "the state dependence of the effects of 0.8-hz stimulation on soactivity reported here has been similarly observed in recent studies using tdcs oscillating at a frequency of 0.75 hz . the oscillating tdcs induced wide - spread endogenous so activity when applied duringnonremandsws , whereas the increase in so activity was marginal and locally restricted to the prefrontal cortex when the stimulation was applied to the waking brain ( kirov et al . , 2009 ; marshall et al .",
    "however , the waking brain responded with an increased theta activity to 0.75-hz tdcs .",
    "the convergence of these findings tempts to speculate about the concept of a resonance frequency that characterizes the oscillatory eeg response to rhythmic stimulation for the different brain states . in this view",
    ", sws is essentially characterized by a 0.8-hz resonance frequency , whereas wakefulness as well as light sleep at the transition to deep sleep represent brain states resonating at frequencies different from the 0.8-hz stimulation frequency applied here .",
    "the modulation of 1215-hz spindle activity caused by the random stimulation suggests for the transitory period of light sleep a faster resonance frequency above the so range , as the random stimulation contained a high proportion of shorter isis .",
    "consistent with this view , in a previous study , instrumental conditioning of sensorimotor rhythm in the 1215-hz frequency band effectively decreased sleep onset latency ( hoedlmoser et al .",
    "yet , such assumptions are in need of experimental validation . in conclusion ,",
    "our results indicate that rhythmic acoustic stimulation can be used to induce sleep so activity , which makes it indeed a promising and simple approach for the investigation of putative sleep functions linked to the so rhythm . + * achnowledgment * this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 654 and graduate school 235 ) . + * conflict of interest * none of the authors has any conflict of interest .",
