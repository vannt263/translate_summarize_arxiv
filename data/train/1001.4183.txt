    "three centers of the linear triatomic negative ion is supposed as a coherent source of electrons similar to h@xmath0 and the detached - electron wave function is obtained as a superposition of the three coherent waves originating from each center of the system . the detached - electron flux , due to the superposition of these three waves , on a screen is calculated . for the total photodetachment cross section , of a linear triatomic negative ion",

    "fourier transformation in fig .",
    "3 shows that these two types of orbits are responsible for the oscillations in the total photodetachment cross section and hence there are two oscillation frequencies in the three - center system in contrast to only one oscillation frequency in the two - center system .",
