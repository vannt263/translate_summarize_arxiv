    "an apparent horizon ( elsewhere dubbed `` trapping horizon''@xcite ) is a space- ( or time-)like surface defined as the closure of a surface foliated by marginally trapped surfaces .",
    "what follows is based on the analysis and results of ref .  .",
    "the existence and location of the apparent horizons are determined by the condition @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the areal radius ( not to be confused with the isotropic radius @xmath6 ) . for the clifton  mota  barrow solutions and for an expanding universe with @xmath7 this condition reads@xcite [ main ] hr^2- m a(t ) a(r)^-a(r)^+1r = 0 , where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter corresponding to the scale factor @xmath9 .",

    "the initial behaviour ( a unique , expanding apparent horizon ) is common in all of these different configurations .    for dust , radiation , and stiff matter",

    "the complete analysis of the clifton - mota - barrow solution reveals a richer phenomenology@xcite than just the previous example .",
    "in particular , the general relativity limit @xmath19 turns out to correspond to a generalized mcvittie metric@xcite . in this case",
    "an initial naked singularity is then covered by two appearing horizons .",
    "this is true for any equation of state of the cosmological fluid except for the cosmological constant . for",
    "the latter the reverse happens , that is , an expanding and a contracting horizon merge to leave behind a naked singularity .",
    "we conclude with a warning : as already mentioned , apparent horizons depend on the spacetime slicings adopted , namely , specific slicings could imply the absence of apparent horizons even though the singularity is hidden by an event horizon . from this perspective , the issue of the presence of the naked spacetime singularity reported above becomes particularly delicate .",
    "nonetheless , looking for apparent horizons is probably the most straightforward probe for event horizon and it seems unlikely that slicing dependence seriously affects the results for a spherically symmetric foliation of a flrw spacetime .",
