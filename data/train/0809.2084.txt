    "it is possible to predict an elastically induced first - order transition from the paraelectric to the antiferroelectric phase for @xmath93 , turning into second order for smaller values of concentration , and which is in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "the glassy transition can still be understood within the framework of the rigid sk models , with the well - known instability of the replica - symmetric solution in the low - temperature region .",
    "it is important to remark that the inclusion of gaussian random fields is not capable of explaining a first - order transition , in contrast to the predictions of the proposed compressible model @xcite .",
    "in fact , first - order transitions are associated to either a double - delta distribution of random fields @xcite or to the consideration of certain discrete quadrupolar - glass and potts - glass models @xcite .",
