    "since their introduction by atiyah @xcite , segal @xcite and witten @xcite , topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) have been studied intensely using a wide range of techniques . the first construction in 2 + 1 dimensions was given by reshetikhin and turaev @xcite using representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity to construct link invariants and in turn derive invariants of 3-manifolds through surgery and kirby calculus .",
    "shortly thereafter , a combinatorial construction was given by blanchet , habegger , masbaum and vogel @xcite in the language of skein theory .",
    "a geometric realization was proposed by witten @xcite , suggesting the use of quantum chern - simons theory or conformal field theory to construct the 2-dimensional part .",
    "the gauge theoretic approach was studied independently by axelrod , della pietra and witten @xcite and hitchin @xcite , proving that the quantum spaces arising from geometric quantization of chern - simons theory for compact gauge group are indeed independent of the conformal structure on the surface , in the sense that they are identified by parallel transport of a projectively flat connection over the teichmller space of the surface .",
    "these constructions have been expressed and generalized in purely differential geometric terms in @xcite and @xcite , and we shall be mainly concerned with this description in the present paper . the other construction proposed by witten , through conformal field theory , was provided by tsuchiya , ueno and yamada @xcite , and the link to the gauge theoretic construction was established by laszlo @xcite .",
    "only recently has the relation to reshetikhin and turaev been fully demonstrated . in a series of papers @xcite , the first author of this paper and ueno obtain a modular functor , from a twist of the conformal field theory construction , and identify it with the modular functor constructed from skein theory , and hence with the original construction of reshetikhin and turaev",
    "this has paved the way for studying the tqft through geometric quantization of moduli space and in particular the application of toeplitz operator theory , see e.g. @xcite . for non - compact gauge group ,",
    "the situation is very different . in the paper @xcite",
    ", witten initiated the study of chern - simons topological quantum field theory for complex gauge groups from a physical point of view .",
    "he proposed that the smooth sections of the chern - simons line bundle over the moduli space of flat connections in the corresponding compact real form of the group should be the appropriate pre - hilbert space of this theory .",
    "he reduced the description to this model space by considering a real polarization , which we review in section [ qcst ] , on the space of connections with values in the complex gauge group .",
    "although this model space itself does not depend on a choice of complex structure on the surface , the polarization , and hence the interpretation as the quantum space , does .",
    "witten argued that the needed infinitesimal change of polarization , under infinitesimal change of the complex structure on the surface , can be encoded as a connection in the trivial bundle with the fixed model space as fiber .",
    "furthermore , witten provided infinite - dimensional gauge theory arguments for the projective flatness of this connection .    in this paper , we review the general differential geometric construction of the hitchin connection for a rigid family of complex structures on a symplectic manifold with vanishing first betti number and first chern class represented essentially by the symplectic form . inspired by witten s considerations",
    ", we also consider a certain one - parameter family of connections on the prequantum spaces . for any value of the parameter",
    ", the resulting connection will be called the hitchin - witten connection .",
    "the main feature of both connections is projective flatness , at least when the khler structures have few symmetries , and we shall establish this fact by direct curvature calculations .",
    "let us briefly introduce the setting and state the main results .",
    "the basic assumptions and their implications will be explored in greater detail in the following sections .",
    "consider a symplectic manifold @xmath0 , with vanishing first betti number and first chern class given by @xmath1 $ ] , for some integer @xmath2 .",
    "futhermore , let @xmath3 be a complex manifold parametrizing a holomorphic family @xmath4 of integrable almost complex structures on @xmath5 , none of which admit non - constant holomorphic functions on @xmath6 .",
    "the variation of the khler structure , along the holomorphic part of a vector field on @xmath7 on @xmath3 , is encoded by a section @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 = g(v ) { \\smash{\\cdot}}\\omega$ ] , of the second symmetric power of the holomorphic tangent bundle , and we will assume that the family @xmath10 is _ rigid _ in the sense that the bivector field @xmath11 defines a holomorphic section @xmath12 .    by the assumption on the chern class , the symplectic manifold @xmath5 admits a hermitian line bundle @xmath13 with a compatible connection of curvature @xmath14 .",
    "for any @xmath15 , the space @xmath16 of holomorphic setions is the quantum space , at level @xmath17 , arising from geometric quantization using the complex structure @xmath18 .",
    "these spaces sit inside the prequantum space @xmath19 of smooth sections , and as @xmath20 varies , they form a sub - bundle of the trivial bundle @xmath21 . as proved in @xcite , this sub - bundle is preserved by the explicitly given connection , @xmath22 ) + v'[f],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a second - order operator with symbol @xmath11 , and @xmath24 is the ricci potential , expressing the relation between the ricci form @xmath25 and the symplectic form through @xmath26 .",
    "this connection will be called the hitchin connection , and generalizes the connections studied by @xcite and @xcite in the setting of quantum chern - simons theory for compact gauge group .    inspired by the work of witten @xcite , we may also use the family of khler structures to define another connection on @xmath27 by the expression , @xmath28 ) - \\frac{1}{2\\bar t } ( \\delta_{\\bar g(v ) } \\ ! + \\!2 \\nabla _ {      \\bar g(v ) { \\smash{\\cdot}}df } \\!- \\ ! 2{\\lambda}v''[f ] ) \\!+ \\ !",
    "v[f],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any complex number @xmath29 with real part equal to @xmath30 .",
    "we shall refer to this as the hitchin - witten connection at level @xmath30 .",
    "of course it also depends on the imaginary part of @xmath31 , so for each level @xmath30 we get family of theories , parametrized by one real parameter .    unlike the hitchin connection",
    ", the hitchin - witten connection will not preserve the sub - bundle of quantum spaces .",
    "both connections do , however , share another meritorious feature , captured by the main theorem of the paper .",
    "[ thm : mt ] if all complex structures in the family have zero - dimensional symmetry group , then both the hitchin and hitchin - witten connections are projectively flat .",
    "since the moduli spaces have no holomorphic vector fields , which is equivalent to the condition stated in the theorem , we get the following immediate corollary    [ thm : mtcs ] the hitchin and hitchin - witten connections for the moduli spaces of flat connections on a closed oriented surface are projectively flat .",
    "this result on the hitchin connection , for the moduli spaces of flat @xmath32 connections , is due to hitchin , but his proof uses algebraic geometric properties of these moduli spaces . as mentioned above , witten gave an infinite - dimensional gauge - theoretic argument for this result on the hitchin - witten connection , for the same moduli spaces . in this paper , we provide a purely differential geometric finite - dimensional argument for projective flatness , which applies in the more general setting we have described .    as explained above , the quantum representation of the mapping class groups from the reshetikhin - turaev tqft for @xmath32 coincides with the representation obtained from the hitchin connection .",
    "we expect that the same will hold for the hitchin - witten connection and quantum chern - simons theory for the complex gauge group @xmath33 . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the first author has computed explicitly the resulting representation of the mapping class group for genus @xmath34 , the gauge group @xmath35 and all integer levels @xmath30 .",
    "only recently has the whole tqft been rigorously constructed by the first author of this paper and kashaev in @xcite and @xcite for the case of @xmath36 and level @xmath37 , using quantum teichmller theory and the faddeev quantum dilogarithm . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the same authors have constructed quantum chern - simons theory for @xmath36 and all non - negative integer levels @xmath30 and further understood how it relates to the geometric quantization of the @xmath36-moduli spaces .",
    "in fact , they have proposed a very general scheme which just requires a pontryagin self - dual locally compact group , which we expect will lead to the construction of the @xmath33 for all non - negative integer levels @xmath30 .",
    "this should be seen in parallel to the developments on indeces @xcite , which should be related to the level @xmath38 theory . in the physics literature",
    ", the complex quantum chern - simons theory has been discussed from a path integral point of view in a number of papers @xcite and latest by dimofte @xcite using the more advanced 3d-3d correspondence .",
    "let us briefly outline the organization of the paper .",
    "section [ cha : famil - kahl - struct ] discusses general aspects of families of khler structures on a fixed symplectic manifold .",
    "in particular , a rather serious holomorphicity condition , called rigidity ( ) , on the infinitesimal deformation of the khler structure will be discussed .",
    "we derive a symmetry result ( ) for certain tensor fields associated with such families , which will prove crucial in the calculation of the curvature of the hitchin connection . in section [ cha : geom - quant ]",
    ", we briefly recall the basics of geometric quantization , described as a two stage process where the prequantum space @xmath39 is first constructed as sections of a line bundle , and the quantum space @xmath40 is then defined as the subspace of polarized sections with respect to some choice of auxiliary khler polarization .",
    "one way of understanding the influence of this choice on quantization is by studying the infinitesimal behaviour of a family of such polarizations , and this is exactly the approach employed with the hitchin connection , which relates the quantum spaces through parallel transport .",
    "following the initial discussion , we calculate the commutators of general second - order differential operators acting on the prequantum spaces .",
    "these results will be useful when calculating the curvature of the hitchin connection .",
    "the hitchin connection is the subject of section [ cha : hitchin - connection ] , which contains the main results .",
    "after briefly reviewing the differential geometric construction of the hitchin connection , we move on to the straightforward but rather lengthy calculation of its curvature , culminating with the first major result in .",
    "the fact that the curvature acts as a differential operator of order at most one is a crucial point .",
    "building on these computations and inspiration from witten s work on quantum chern - simons theory for complex gauge group @xcite , we then consider the hitchin - witten connection defined in as well as above .",
    "the second major result is the calculation of its curvature in .",
    "the expressions turn out to be essentially equal to the curvature of the hitchin connection in , and in particular it acts as a differential operator of order at most one .",
    "this property , shared by both connections , entails projective flatness if , for instance , the family of complex structures does not admit holomorphic vector fields .",
    "this is the content of , leading ultimately to .",
    "the final section applies the results to quantum chern - simons theory , both for compact and complex gauge groups .",
    "the hitchin connection was originally studied in this setting , with compact gauge group @xmath32 , by hitchin @xcite and axelrod , della pietra and .",
    "our results provide another proof of projective flatness , which still relies on the absence of holomorphic vector fields , but uses general properties of rigid families of khler structures to prove the vanishing of higher - order symbols .",
    "as mentioned , the case of complex gauge group was studied by witten in @xcite , where he used a real polarization to reduce the quantum space from complex to unitary connections .",
    "the real polarization , and hence the reduction , depends on the conformal structure on the surface , and witten derived a formula for an analogue of the hitchin connection in this model , arriving at exactly the expression .",
    "we recall the necessary theory and connect it with the results of previous sections , providing a differential geometric and purely finite - dimensional construction of a projectively flat connection , the hitchin - witten connection , in witten s model of quantum chern - simons theory with complex gauge group .",
    "before we recall the construction of the hitchin connection and calculate its curvature , we will explore the properties of families of khler structures on a symplectic manifold .",
    "such families are central to the notion of a hitchin connection , and the results obtained will play a fundamental role in subsequent parts .",
    "the section serves to introduce notation , establish conventions and provide a number of basic results for later reference .",
    "the result is somewhat lengthy and can be read swiftly on first reading .",
    "let @xmath41 be a symplectic manifold .",
    "if @xmath3 is a manifold , we say that a smooth map , @xmath42 is a family of khler structures on @xmath41 if it defines an integrable and @xmath43-compatible almost complex structure for every point @xmath15 .",
    "smoothness of @xmath10 means that it defines a smooth section of the pullback bundle @xmath44 over @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the projection .",
    "for any point @xmath15 , the almost complex structure @xmath18 induces a splitting , @xmath47 of the complexified tangent bundle of @xmath6 into the two eigenspaces of @xmath18 , with associated subspace projections @xmath48 and @xmath49 , explicitly given by @xmath50 we denote by @xmath51 the associated splitting of a vector field @xmath52 on @xmath53 . in general",
    ", the subscript @xmath54 indicates dependence on the complex structure , but we shall typically ommit it when the dependence is obvious and the formula is valid for any point in @xmath3 .",
    "the khler metric associated with the complex structure @xmath10 is given by @xmath55 where the dot denotes contraction of tensors .",
    "the inverses of @xmath56 and @xmath43 are denoted by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , and they are the unique symmetric , respectively anti - symmetric , bivector fields satisfying @xmath59 as above , a dot will be used to denote contraction of tensors , and the placement of the tensors relative to each other indicates which entries to contract .",
    "we will , however , also encounter more complicated expressions , where the entries to be contracted can not be indicated by simply placing the tensors next to each other . in such cases , we will use abstract indices to denote the entries of each tensor .",
    "the indices only name the entries of a tensor , and do not represent a choice of local coordinates . as usual ,",
    "subscript indices refer to covariant entries of a tensor , whereas superscript indices refer to contravariant entries , and following the einstein convention , repeated indices will indicate contraction . if the two contracted indices are both either subscript or superscript , the khler metric is used for contraction . with these conventions ,",
    "the above identities become @xmath60 in a few places , we will also need to apply the projections @xmath61 and @xmath62 to the entries of the tensor . in the index notation ,",
    "composition with @xmath61 will be indicated by a prime on the index , whereas composition with @xmath62 will be indicated by two primes . as an example we can write @xmath63 for the symplectic form , which is of type ( 1,1 ) with respect to a compatible complex structure .",
    "associated with the khler metric @xmath56 , we have the levi - civita connection @xmath64 , and as usual its curvature is defined by @xmath65 }    z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any vector fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 on @xmath6 . in abstract index notation , the curvature writes @xmath68 , and we can use the metric to lower the upper index and get the curvature tensor @xmath69 the ricci curvature is the symmetric @xmath10-invariant tensor @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 and its corresponding skew - symmetric two - form is the ricci form @xmath72 , which would correspond to @xmath73 in index notation .",
    "finally , the scalar curvature @xmath74 is the metric trace of the ricci curvature @xmath75    if @xmath76 is a vector bundle over @xmath6 and @xmath77 is a differential operator of order at most @xmath78 , we can assign the principal symbol @xmath79 , which is a symmetric section of the @xmath78th tensor power of the tangent bundle . if the principal symbol vanishes , then @xmath80 is of order at most @xmath81 . in general",
    ", there is no good notion of lower order symbols of differential operators , but a connection on @xmath76 and can be combined with the levi - civita connection on @xmath6 to define symbols of all orders . for vector fields",
    "@xmath82 on @xmath6 , we consider the inductively defined differential operator on sections of @xmath76 , @xmath83 with the obvious induction start given by the covariant derivative .",
    "it is easily verified that this expression is tensorial in the vector fields , so we get a map @xmath84 for any tensor field @xmath85 , the symbol of @xmath86 is given by the symmetrization @xmath87 of @xmath88 . if @xmath77 is an operator , of order at most @xmath78 , with principal symbol @xmath89 , then the operator @xmath90 is of order at most @xmath81 , since its principal symbol vanishes .",
    "inductively , it follows that the operator @xmath80 can be written uniquely in the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is called the _ symbol of order @xmath93 _ and gives rise to a map @xmath94 any finite order differential operator on @xmath76 is uniquely determined by the values of these symbol maps . in fact , through the expression , a choice of symbols specifies a differential operator on any vector bundle with connection , and in particular on functions .",
    "we will also need the notion of divergence of vector fields and more general contravariant tensors .",
    "recall that the divergence @xmath95 of a vector field @xmath52 on @xmath6 is defined in terms of the lie derivative and volume form by the equation @xmath96 .",
    "although the divergence of a vector field only depends on the symplectic volume , and not on the khler metric itself , a simple computation reveals that the divergence can be calculated using the levi - civita connection by the formula @xmath97 in which the independence of the khler structure is perhaps not so evident .",
    "the laplace - de rham operator on functions can be expressed in terms of the divergence by @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the ( 1,0)-part of the hamiltonian vector field associated with the function @xmath100 .",
    "the formula generalizes to tensors of higher degree . for vector fields @xmath82 om @xmath6 , we define @xmath101 this defines a map @xmath102 , also called the divergence , which does depend on the khler structure",
    ".    the generalization of divergence to sections of the endomorphism bundle of the tangent bundle will also be convenient .",

    "the khler structure @xmath10 only depends on the riemann surface structure up to isotopy , so in fact we get a family @xmath475 of khler structures parametrized by the teichmller space @xmath476 of the surface . at a unitary connection @xmath438 , the family @xmath10 clearly preserves the real subspace @xmath477 tangent to @xmath421",
    ", so @xmath10 also defines a family of khler structures on @xmath421 .",
    "this is indeed the polarization we shall use for quantizing @xmath421 , but for @xmath422 we shall instead rely on a certain real polarization , considered by witten in @xcite , which also depends on the riemann surface structure of @xmath411 .",
    "let us first recall how the quantization of the moduli space @xmath421 for compact gauge group proceeds .",
    "the moduli space @xmath421 is simply connected , so in particular @xmath478 vanishes , and furthermore @xmath479 ( see @xcite ) . for a given point @xmath480 in teichmller space , the properties of @xmath481 as a complex manifold can be understood through the classical work of narasimhan and seshadri @xcite , which identifies @xmath6 with the moduli space of s - equivalence classes of semi - stable holomorpic vector bundles , over the riemann surface @xmath411 , of rank @xmath78 , degree @xmath93 and fixed determinant .",
    "this space has the structure of an normal projective algebraic variety which is typically singular but contains the moduli space of stable bundles as an open smooth subvariety , corresponding exactly to the manifold @xmath421 of irreducible connections . in this picture , the holomorphic tangent space @xmath482}m^s$ ] at a stable holomorphic bundle @xmath76 is given by the cohomology @xmath483 , with values in the traceless endomorphisms . as we saw above",
    ", the moduli space @xmath421 admits a prequantum line bundle @xmath13 , which is just the determinant line bundle in this picture .",
    "it generates the picard group , so in particular @xmath484 $ ] is a generator of @xmath485 , and @xmath486 $ ] with @xmath487 as proved in @xcite .    if the rank @xmath78 and the degree @xmath93 are coprime , there are no strictly semi - stable bundles , so @xmath488 is a compact khler manifold . in this case , clearly @xmath489 , but as observed by hitchin @xcite , this holds even for non - coprime @xmath78 and @xmath93 by the hartogs theorem , since the complement of @xmath421 in @xmath6 has codimension at least 2 .",
    "hitchin also notes that the family @xmath10 of khler structures on @xmath421 parametrized by teichmller space , which is itself in a canonical way a contractible complex manifold , is holomorphic and rigid in the sense of and . finally , the khler metric on the moduli space of stable bundles was studied by zograf and takhtajan in @xcite , where they give a ricci potential in terms of the determinant of the laplacian on the endomorphism bundle of a stable bundle .",
    "altogether , the discussion above demonstrates that the moduli space @xmath421 satisfies all the conditions of to ensure the existence of a hitchin connection .",
    "furthermore , in the case of coprime @xmath78 and @xmath93 , narasimhan and ramanan @xcite have shown that @xmath421 does not admit any holomorphic vector fields , so implies that the hitchin connection must be projectively flat .    projective flatness also holds in the non - coprime case , which similarly does not admit holomorphic vector fields .",
    "hitchin @xcite proves this by regarding a holomorphic vector field on @xmath421 as a holomorphic function on the cotangent bundle @xmath490 , which sits inside the moduli space of semi - stable higgs bundles @xmath491 , as discussed below . once again appealing to the hartogs theorem ,",
    "the function , which is homogeneous of degree 1 in the action of @xmath492 and constant along fibers of the hitchin fibration , can be extended to @xmath491 , which is quite easily seen not to support such functions .",
    "the proof does not apply to the special situation when the genus @xmath56 and the rank @xmath78 are both equal to 2 , and the holonomy around @xmath417 is trivial , because the moduli space @xmath420 is isomorphic to @xmath493 and clearly has holomorphic vector fields .",
    "in summary , we have proved projective flatness of the hitchin connection for the moduli spaces as claimed in .",
    "our proof of projective flatness follows the original proof by hitchin @xcite from the point where the curvature is known to be at most order one , but vanishing of the higher - order terms was established by hitchin through particular properties of the hitchin integrable system @xcite , whereas we derive it from rigidity of the family of khler structures .",
    "we now turn to the problem of quantizing the moduli space @xmath422 of irreducible @xmath402-connections .",
    "the theory of higgs bundles naturally enters in this discussion as well .",
    "suppose again that @xmath411 is endowed with a riemann surface structure and recall that a higgs bundle is a pair @xmath494 , where @xmath495 is a holomorphic vector bundle and the higgs field @xmath496 is a holomorphic one - form with values in the traceless endomorphisms of @xmath76 .",
    "stability for higgs bundles is defined by imposing the usual stability condition on the slope of subbundles @xmath497 , but only the invariant ones satisfying @xmath498 .",
    "this leads to the moduli spaces @xmath491 and @xmath499 , of semi - stable , respectively stable , higgs bundles of rank @xmath78 , degree @xmath93 and fixed determinant .",
    "nitsure @xcite proves that @xmath491 is a quasi - projective algebraic variety , which contains @xmath499 as an open smooth subvariety . through the work of hitchin , simpson , donaldson and corlette @xcite ,",
    "the moduli space @xmath491 can be identified , via the hitchin equations and non - abelian hodge theory , with the moduli space @xmath420 of flat reductive @xmath402-connections , with stable bundles corresponding to irreducible connections .",
    "if @xmath76 is itself already a stable bundle , then obviously stability as a higgs bundle is implied for any higgs field @xmath500 . in particular , by simply taking the higgs field to be zero",
    ", the moduli space @xmath421 sits canonically inside @xmath501 , as we discussed already at the level of representations .",
    "but in fact , the entire cotangent bundle of @xmath421 can be embedded in @xmath422 , although the embedding depends crucially on the riemann surface structure of @xmath411 .",
    "indeed , we get the following identification by serre duality , @xmath502 where we recognize the right - hand side as the holomorphic cotangent space of the moduli space @xmath421 . in other words ,",
    "the higgs fields on stable bundles can be viewed as cotangent vectors to @xmath421 through serre duality .",
    "the higgs bundle model @xmath499 of @xmath503 illuminates the hyperkhler structure but it also carries a natural action of @xmath492 by scaling the higgs field .    to quantize the modulu space @xmath422 , we follow witten @xcite and define a family of real polarizations , parametrized by the teichmller space of @xmath411 , in the following way . for any riemann surface structure on @xmath411 , in the form of a star - operator @xmath473 as usual , we can use hodge theory to split the space @xmath504 into types , @xmath505 although this uses the complex structure on @xmath504 , it defines a splitting of the underlying real space , which is a model for the real tangent space @xmath437}m^s_{{\\scriptscriptstyle { { \\mathbbm{c}}}}}$ ] . since the symplectic form @xmath441 is invariant under the hodge - star , the same of course applies to @xmath446 , so that each of the summands are lagrangian",
    ".    we shall take the subspaces @xmath506 as a polarization , and define the quantum space to be the polarized sections of @xmath507 , which are covariantly constant along its leaves .",
    "notice that the polarization at a unitary connection @xmath438 is transverse to the tangent space @xmath437}m^s = h^1_a(\\sigma , { \\mathfrak{g}})$ ] , simply because the only real form of type ( 1,0 ) is the zero form .",
    "this means that a polarized section is determined by its values on the space @xmath421 , or in other words , that the quantum space is identified with the prequantum space @xmath508 of smooth sections over @xmath421 , although the identification depends on the complex structure on @xmath411 .",
    "surely this identification requires covariantly constant sections to exist on the leaves of the foliation , which would be guaranteed for instance if they were simply connected , but we shall not deal with this question here . instead , the discussion can be taken as motivation for using @xmath508 as a model for the quantum space of @xmath422 .",
    "to understand how the identification between the quantum space of @xmath422 and the prequantum space @xmath508 depends on the riemann surface structure , we consider the latter as the fiber of a trivial bundle over teichmller space , @xmath509 then the expression defines a connection @xmath510 on this bundle , which is projectively flat by , once again due to the fact that the moduli space @xmath421 does not admit any holomorphic vector fields for any of the khler structures in the family @xmath10 parametrized by teichmller space .",
    "this establishes the second statement of on the hitchin - witten connection .",
    "we also expand the statement in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm:3 ] for any @xmath29 with @xmath352 , the trivial bundle @xmath511 over teichmller space , with fiber given by the smooth sections of the chern - simons line bundle over the moduli space of flat @xmath32 connections , has a projectively flat connection given by @xmath512 ) - \\frac{1}{2\\bar t } ( \\delta_{\\bar g(v ) } \\ ! + \\!2 \\nabla_{\\ !",
