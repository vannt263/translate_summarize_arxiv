    "the notion of conjugacy in semigroups can be generalized from the corresponding notion for groups in several ways . perhaps , the two most natural and commonly used notions are the relations @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whose definitions below are taken from  @xcite .",

    "@xmath0-conjugate _ or just _ conjugate_. it is easy to see that in the case of group , both @xmath8 and @xmath9 coincide with usual group conjugacy .",
    "besides , for a monoid @xmath0 there is an inclusion @xmath18 .",
    "the structure of conjugacy and @xmath5-conjugacy classes for some specific regular semigroups was studied in a number of papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , see also the monograph @xcite . for the relation of conjugacy",
    "the structure of conjugacy classes usually happens to be more complicated than for the relation of @xmath5-conjugacy .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the systematic study of the conjugacy relation in regular epigroups ( an _ epigroup _ or a _ group - bound semigroup _ is a semigroup such that some power of each its element lies in a subgroup ) and is organized as follows . in the preliminaries",
    "we collect some notation used throughout the paper and cite some well - known facts about the structure of @xmath19-classes . in section  [ s3 ]",
    "we establish a criterion of conjugacy of two group elements of a given semigroup . in section  [ s4 ]",

    "besides , for the first time we formulate and prove conjugacy criteria for the semigroups @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( see the explanations for the notations at the appropriate places of the paper ) .    in the case",
    "when a regular semigroup @xmath0 is not group - bound , the problem of description of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 seems to be much more complicated , in particular , even for such a classical semigroup as @xmath25 the conjugacy classes are not classified yet . at the same time , for the semigroup @xmath26 , which is also not an epigroup , the conjugacy classes are described ( see  @xcite ) .    in appendix",

    "this implies , in particular , that in @xmath28 there are conjugacy classes without group elements showing that the conjugacy criterion for the semigroup @xmath28 announced in theorems 3,4 of  @xcite fails to give sufficient condition of conjugacy . at the same time we have substantial arguments that the description of conjugacy classes in @xmath28 can be obtained using the methods from  @xcite .",
