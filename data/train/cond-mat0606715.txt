    "the continuous progress in the fabrication of small electronic circuits has kept active the theoretical study of quantum electronic transport .",
    "for example , transport properties in point contacts , atomic chains , carbon nanotubes , and quantum wires are currently under experimental investigations .",
    "although the theoretical study of electronic transport in mesoscopic systems  where the phase coherence of electrons is preserved along the whole device has been of great interest for several decades , these recent experimental advances have further renewed the motivation of theoreticians for studying the electronic transport through one - dimensional structures .    in a disordered mesoscopic wire",
    "the random position of impurities gives a stochastic character to the electronic transport .",
    "therefore , it is of particular relevance the analysis of the statistical properties of transport quantities like the conductance . on the theoretical side , there is a full description of the statistical properties of the conductance in quasi - one - dimensional disordered systems within an independent - electron picture at zero temperature @xmath1 and `` zero bias '' ( actually , infinitesimally small voltage ) @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite this degree of detail in the theoretical description is , however , not available for disordered wires at finite temperatures and bias voltage , even in the simple case of one - dimensional ( 1d ) wires .",
    "this is an unfortunate fact since experiments are usually performed within a wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the effect of finite bias voltage has been found to modify the behavior of the conductance fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    several efforts have been made in order to incorporate the information of a finite @xmath1 into the statistical description of quantum electronic transport in 1d - disordered systems . in ref .",
    ", at zero voltage , a model of zero - width resonances represented by @xmath5-functions was introduced in order to calculate the dependence on the temperature of the averages of the conductance @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "assuming full coherent transport , in ref .",
    "the effect of the thermal smearing on the mean resistance of a 1d wire was studied .    at finite temperature and bias voltage ,",
    "the distribution of the conductance @xmath3 was calculated in ref . by using a statistical model of resonant tunneling transmission .",
    "the methodology there employed was , however , restricted to disordered wires of length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mean free path , and very small values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( although sizable ) : typically @xmath10 and @xmath11 were considered of the order or smaller than the mean spacing between energy levels @xmath12 . within this regime of temperatures and voltages it can be assumed that only one resonance  the closest to",
    "the fermi energy contributes to the transport . even with these limitations , that work",
    "shows that the conductance distribution do display novel features as a consequence of finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 values .",
    "particularly , it was shown that the distribution of conductances narrows as the value of @xmath1 and/or @xmath2 is increased .",
    "we would like to remark that the assumption of phase coherent transport adopted in previous works , as well as in the present one , is restricted by the phase relaxation @xmath13 at finite temperature and voltage .",
    "for example , inelastic scattering and thermally activated hopping processes,@xcite which might be important at finite values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 are not considered in our analysis . in ref .",
    ", however , it is discussed the possibility of satisfying @xmath14 even at finite temperature and bias voltage for short enough wires , which opens the possibility of observing the effect of finite @xmath15 on the statistical properties of the conductance in realistic systems .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the range of voltage @xmath2 where the averaged charge current @xmath16 is a linear function of @xmath2 or departs slightly from this behavior , i.e. , the so - called _ linear response _ regime , can be rather wide as we will show in section [ results ] .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to compute the distribution of the conductance @xmath4 at values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 typically larger than the mean level spacing , where several resonances contribute to the conductance .",
    "we show that , within this regime of temperatures and voltages , the distribution of the conductance can be well described in terms of the convolutions of the zero temperature / voltage conductance distribution @xmath17 .",
    "the number of distributions to be convolved is determined by the number of resonances in an energy window where electron transport can take place .",
    "this energy window is defined by the value of the temperature and voltage .",
    "the method introduced in the present work applies to any degree of disorder i.e. _ to any value _ of the ratio @xmath18 , provided several resonances contribute to the transport , allowing for the investigation of short wires where coherent transport is more likely to be observed . for completeness in the sense that all regimes of temperature and voltage will be covered in this paper , we also study the regime of small @xmath1 and @xmath2 following ref .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we present the methodology to analytically calculate the conductance distribution @xmath3 .",
    "we divide this section into two subsections . the first one , [ resonant_model ] , is devoted to review the case of small temperatures and voltage regimes where one can assume that only the closest resonance to the fermi energy contribute to the conductance .",
    "@xcite in the second one , subsection [ convolution_method ] , we introduce a method based on the convolution of the known distribution of conductances at zero temperature and bias voltage in order to study the regime of high temperatures and bias voltages .",
    "in section [ results ] we present the model used in our simulations and show some general features of our 1d - disordered system obtained numerically , which support the assumptions introduced in our theoretical proposal of section [ method ] . in section [ results ]",
    "we also compare the results of the distribution @xmath3 from the numerical simulations to the predictions of the theoretical approach presented in the previous section , for the different regimes of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in section [ summary ] we give a summary and conclusions of our study of the distribution of conductances at finite temperature and bias voltage .",
    "we consider the usual setup where the disordered conductor is placed between left and right reservoirs at the same finite temperature @xmath1 and chemical potentials @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the conductance @xmath21 can be written as ( in units of the conductance quantum @xmath22 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 + 1\\right\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function , being @xmath25 the boltzmann constant , while @xmath26 is the dimensionless conductance for @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear from the above integral expression for @xmath4 that the energy window where electronic transport takes place will depend on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this can be emphasized recasting the difference in the fermi functions in the above expression , eq.([gtv ] ) , as @xcite @xmath29 where the symbol @xmath30 denotes the convolution in energy , @xmath31 is the unit step function , and @xmath32 is the thermal smearing function .",
    "therefore , the difference of the fermi functions can be expressed as a convolution in energy of two functions : one depends only on the applied voltage @xmath2 and the other one , only on temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that thermal and voltages effects are statistically independent , and this will be useful to calculate the distribution of @xmath4 .      in this subsection we briefly review the resonant model introduced in ref . .",
    "this model is appropriate for systems with non overlapping resonances , which is satisfied for disordered systems with @xmath33 . assuming a lorentzian line shape for the resonances , the dimensionless conductance @xmath26 at @xmath34 can be written as @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total width , @xmath37 $ ] are the left and right partial widths , and @xmath38 are the localization lengths . on resonance @xmath39 , the terms of the sum eq .",

( [ g_model ] ) can be simplified to @xcite @xmath47 . \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to calculate the distribution of the conductance @xmath3 a statistical model for the resonances is introduced : the resonances @xmath48 and their positions @xmath49 are considered uniformly distributed in a interval @xmath12 and @xmath50 , respectively , while the distribution of the inverse of the localization lengths @xmath51 follows a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this distribution for @xmath54 is good for systems with @xmath55 . in section [ results ]",
    "we will show some examples for the distribution @xmath3 obtained within this resonant tunneling model .",
    "we now go to the main goal of this work and propose a description of the conductance distribution , which is valid for arbitrary length of the wire and for voltages and temperatures satisfying @xmath56 , but small enough to satisfy that the behavior of the average current does not depart from linear response .",

    "this is a natural assumption since for a given disorder realization @xmath26 is a spectral function with peaks at the energy levels of the wire ( resonances ) . in a non - interacting electron picture ,",
    "the height of the resonance peaks , as well as the energy levels change for different disorder realizations , but the average separation between levels is a well defined quantity and the spectral weights centered at the different energy levels are uncorrelated .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath26 is a random stationary function of the energy , at least in the energy window where transport takes place",

    "we have simplified the problem by introducing an effective number of resonances that allow us to reduce the problem of finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 to the simpler case of zero temperature , and finite @xmath2 .",
    "the results of our theoretical method have been compared to numerical simulations of a 1d - disordered system at different regimes of temperature , voltage , and different values of the length of the system .",
    "a good agreement has been found in all cases .",
    "we point out that for small @xmath1 and @xmath2 the line shape of the resonances was relevant in the calculation of @xmath4 ( see section [ resonant_model ] ) .",
    "when the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are such that several resonances contribute to the conductance , the line shape is seen to be irrelevant . to conclude , we remark that with the resonant model and the convolution method of sections [ resonant_model ] and [ convolution_method ] , respectively , we are able to analyze the conductance distribution at all regimes of temperature and bias voltage , under the assumptions described in the paper .",
