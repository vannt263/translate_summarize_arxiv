    "this paper is concerned with the sparse representation of the boundary integral operator of two - dimensional scattering problems .",
    "let @xmath7 be a bounded soft scatterer in @xmath8 with a smooth boundary and @xmath9 be the incoming wave field .",
    "the scattered field @xmath10 satisfies the two - dimensional exterior dirichlet problem of the helmholtz equation : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 one attractive method for dealing with this problem is to reformulate it using a boundary integral equation for an unknown field @xmath14 on @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for the exterior normal direction of @xmath15 at the point @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a coupling constant of order @xmath1 .",
    "the kernels @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the green s function of the helmholtz equation and its normal derivative , given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 once @xmath14 is obtained from solving the integral equation , the scattered field @xmath10 at @xmath24 can be evaluated as @xmath25 an important property of from the computational point of view is that its condition number is often quite small and , as a result , one can advantageously solve with an iterative algorithm like gmres . at each step of the iterative solver , we need to apply the integral operator to a given function .",
    "since the integral operator is dense , applying the operator directly is too expensive . in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by efficiently representing the operator as a sparse matrix in a system of wave atoms .",
    "local cosines or wavelet packets have already been proposed for this task with great practical success , see section [ sec : related ] for some references , but we believe that the following two reasons make a case for _ wave atom frames _ :    * the proposed construction is non - adaptive : wave atom frames of @xmath26 are not designed for a specific value of @xmath0 , and no optimization algorithm is needed to find a provably good basis . to achieve this result , the essential property of wave atoms is a parabolic scaling that we discuss later . * the choice of numerical realization for wave atoms follows some of the experience garnered throughout the 1990s in the study of local fourier bases and wavelet packets .",
    "in particular , wave atoms offer a clean multiscale structure in the sense that they avoid the `` frequency leakage '' associated with wavelet packets defined from filterbanks .",
    "these aspects are discussed in @xcite .",
    "of course , any non - adaptive all - purpose numerical compression method is likely to lag in performance behind an adaptive strategy that would include at least the former in its scope ; but this is no excuse for discarding their study .",
    "proper insight about architectures and scalings is important for designing the solution around which , for instance , a library of bases should be deployed for a best basis search .",
    "the main result of this paper says that the wave atom frame is in some sense near - optimal for representing the integral operator in as a sparse matrix .",
    "namely , full matrices would involve @xmath27 elements but we show that @xmath1 matrix elements suffice to represent @xmath28 , and @xmath29 matrix elements suffice to represent @xmath30 to a given accuracy @xmath31 , for arbitrarily small @xmath32 .",
    "we believe that these bounds would not hold for wavelet packets , for instance , even if the best decomposition tree is chosen .",
    "in particular , wavelets would obviously not be suited for the job .    once the sparse representation of is constructed in the wave atom frame",
    ", applying the operator requires only two wave atom transforms and has complexity @xmath33 for a problem with @xmath34 unknowns ( @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath0 , @xmath35 is arbitrarily small . )",
    "the implicit constant is in practice very small , and the wave atom transform itself has complexity @xmath36 .    such a strategy is attractive when the scattering problem needs to be solved several times with different incoming waves @xmath9 .",
    "one important example is the computation of bistatic cross sections , where one needs to calculate the far field patterns of scattered fields for all possible incoming plane waves .",
    "frames of wave atoms were introduced in @xcite on the basis that they provide sparse representations of certain oscillatory patterns . as alluded to earlier , they are a special kind of oriented wavelet packets that do not suffer from the frequency leaking associated to filterbanks , and which obey the important parabolic scaling relation    wavelength @xmath5 ( essential diameter)@xmath6 .",
    "let us rehearse the construction of wave atoms , and refer the reader to @xcite for more details . in one dimension ,",
    "wave atoms are an orthonormal basis indexed by the triple of integers @xmath37 .",
    "the construction is in the frequency domain ; our convention for the fourier transform is @xmath38    * first , @xmath39 is a scale parameter that should be thought of as indexing dilations _ of a factor 4 _ ; in other words , one should consider a first partition of the positive frequency axis into intervals of the form @xmath40 $ ] ( for some constants @xmath41 that will accommodate overlapping of basis functions ) .",
    "choosing @xmath42 such that frequency @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath44 is in contrast with wavelet theory , where @xmath45 over the positive frequency support of a wavelet .",
    "* the parameter @xmath46 with @xmath47 then indexes the further partitioning of each interval @xmath48 $ ] into @xmath49 subintervals of size @xmath50 .",
    "more precisely , wave atoms are centered in frequency near @xmath51 where @xmath52 and are compactly supported in the union of two intervals of length @xmath53 .",
    "the parabolic scaling is now apparent ; the size of the support in frequency @xmath54 is proportional to the square root of the offset from the origin @xmath55 . *",
    "the parameter @xmath56 indexes translations .",
    "a wave atom is centered in space near @xmath57 and has essential support as narrow as the uncertainty principle allows , i.e. , of length @xmath58 .",
    "we define @xmath59 to be the set of all admissible indices ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath60 basis functions are then written @xmath61 where @xmath62 depends weakly on @xmath42 and @xmath46 , and needs to be chosen adequately to form an orthobasis .",
    "the underlying delicate construction of the @xmath62 is due to lars villemoes @xcite and summarized in @xcite .    in two dimensions ,",
    "wave atoms are individually , but not collectively , formed as tensor products of the one - dimensional basis functions .",
    "the construction is `` multiresolution '' in the sense that there is only one dilation parameter ; the indexing 5-uple of integers is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "more precisely , at scale @xmath42 , the valid values for @xmath66 satisfy @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "wave atoms come as an orthonormal basis in two dimensions , but can be made fully directional  supported in a narrow cone in frequency with apex at the origin @xcite  at the expense of increasing the redundancy to 2 or 4 .",
    "the definition of such variants makes use of a unitary recombination involving hilbert - transformed basis functions as in the definition of complex wavelet transforms , and is fully explained in @xcite .",
    "none of the results of this paper would depend on the choice of variant ; and for convenience we use the frame of wave atoms with redundancy four . with @xmath69 ,",
    "the only property of wave atoms that we will need is the characterization @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a @xmath72 non - oscillatory bump that depends on @xmath42 and @xmath73 , but in a non - essential manner , i.e. , @xmath74 independent of @xmath42 and @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , each @xmath71 is simply the tensor product of two corresponding bumps for the 1d transform .",
    "although they may not necessarily form an orthonormal basis , wave atoms still form a tight frame in the sense that expanding a function is an isometry from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , @xmath77 which is equivalent to @xmath78 the same properties hold in one dimension .",
    "the closest analogue to a `` continuous wave atom transform '' was introduced in the mathematical literature by crdoba and fefferman in @xcite .",
    "wave atoms can be compared to brushlets @xcite , but villemoes s construction uses `` local complex exponentials '' instead of local cosines in frequency .",
    "discretized wave atoms are described in @xcite ; they inherit the localization and tight - frame properties of their continuous counterpart .",
    "in particular , their bandlimited character confers an immediate control over the accuracy of computing inner products via quadrature .",
    "they come with fast fft - based @xmath36 algorithms for both the forward and adjoint transforms ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "as functions can be analyzed and synthesized using coefficients , operators can also be expanded from matrix elements in a tight frame . when the frame is chosen appropriately ,",
    "the expansion of the operator is approximately sparse : only a small percentage of the expansion coefficients are nonnegligible while all the rest of the coefficients are almost zero .",
    "thresholding the small coefficients below a certain accuracy level gives rise to a sparse representation of the operator .",
    "typically , this can be done in two ways .    *",
    "the _ standard form _ of an operator @xmath79 in the wave atom frame @xmath80 is @xmath81 where @xmath82 for each fixed @xmath83 , we define @xmath84 to be the set of all @xmath85 such that the modulus of @xmath86 is above a certain threshold .",
    "the sparse representation of @xmath79 then takes the form @xmath87 in practice , the sums in @xmath83 and @xmath85 are also truncated in scale to account for the finite number of samples @xmath34 of the functions to which @xmath79 is applied .",
    "since the wave atom transform computes the coefficients in the tight frame @xmath88 in @xmath89 steps , the above equation naturally gives rise to an efficient method of applying the operator @xmath79 to a given function @xmath90 : * * apply the forward wave atom transform to compute the coefficients @xmath91 . * * for each @xmath83 , compute @xmath92 .",
    "the number of operations of this step is dictated by the number of nonnegligible coefficients of the representation of @xmath79 .",
    "* * apply the adjoint wave atom transform to @xmath93 to synthesize @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 .",
    "* the _ nonstandard form _ of @xmath79 in the two dimensional frame @xmath96 is the set of coefficients @xmath97 , such that the distributional kernel of @xmath79 is expanded as @xmath98 for a fixed threshold value , we define @xmath99 to be the set of all @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is above the threshold in modulus .",
    "the sparse representation of @xmath79 is now @xmath102 .",
    "applying @xmath79 to a given function @xmath90 efficiently using this expansion is more involved than the case of the standard form . for a fixed index @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ", we define the two 1d wave atom indices : @xmath106 since the two dimensional index @xmath104 satisfies @xmath107 and @xmath68 , the set of all possible choices for @xmath108 and @xmath109 are @xmath110 + some of the indices in are not admissible , i.e. , they are not part of the set of indices for the 1d wave atom transform , since if @xmath111 corresponds to a 1d wave atom it would need to satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "non - admissible indices correspond to gabor - type wave forms that partition the frequency domain uniformly and , hence , violate the parabolic scaling .",
    "we use @xmath112 to denote this extended index set @xmath113 the frame formed by these bases functions @xmath88 with @xmath114 are called the _ extended _ wave atom frame . for a given function @xmath90",
    ", the computation of all the coefficients @xmath115 with @xmath116 can be done easily by extending the existing forward wave atom transform to include the extra @xmath46 indices ( @xmath117 ) in @xmath112 .",
    "this _ forward extended wave atom transform _ still has an @xmath118 complexity since the number of extra non - admissible indices @xmath46 at each scale @xmath42 is a small fixed fraction of the number of existing @xmath46 in @xmath59 at scale @xmath42 .",
    "the adjoint transform can be extended similarly and the resulting transform is called the _ adjoint extended wave atom transform_. we note that these new transforms are not orthonormal any more since parts of the input functions are analyzed redundantly .",
    "+ using the notation in and the tensor - product property of @xmath96 , we have @xmath119 when @xmath79 is applied to a given function @xmath90 , we have @xmath120 using the extended transforms , we can derive from the above equation a fast algorithm for applying @xmath79 to @xmath90 using the nonstandard form : * * apply the forward extended wave atom transform to compute the coefficients @xmath91 for all indices @xmath121 .",
    "* * for each @xmath116 , compute @xmath122 .",

    "* * apply the inverse extended wave atom transform to synthesize @xmath94 from @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "+ we would like to point out that nonstandard expansions only exist for two - dimensional frames that have a tensor product representation for each basis function , since the decomposition in is essential for the derivation .",
    "for example , there is no known nonstandard form representation for an operator in the tight frame of curvelets @xcite .    in what follows we focus exclusively on the nonstandard form , because of its relative simplicity over the standard form",
    "this claim may seem paradoxical in view of the preceding discussion , but the basis functions @xmath124 of the nonstandard form have a single dilation parameter and hence a fixed isotropic aspect ratio , unlike the tensor basis @xmath125 which come in all shapes and can be very elongated when @xmath126 .",
    "the isotropy of the envelope of @xmath96 makes some of the stationary - phase argument in the sequel , simpler in our view .",
    "the kernel @xmath127 does not display the anisotropy of tensor wave atoms along the axes ",
    "if anything , @xmath127 is singular along the diagonal @xmath128so choosing the nonstandard form also seems to us more natural from the numerical viewpoint .",
    "we can however not exclude at this point that the standard form may enjoy comparable sparsity properties as the nonstandard form .      in this section",
    ", we formulate the main result on sparsity of the nonstandard wave atom matrix of the acoustic single and double - layer potentials , in two dimensions .",

    "the main ingredients are sparsity estimates in @xmath183 , stationary phase considerations , vaguelette - type estimates adapted to wave atoms , and @xmath3 correspondence scale - by - scale with wavelets . in section",
    "[ sec : num ] we present some numerical experiments that support the theory and establish wave atoms as a practical tool for solving scattering problems .",

    "they proved that the number of coefficients with absolute value greater than any fixed @xmath4 is bounded by @xmath184 when the constant depends on @xmath4 .",
    "notice that our result in theorem [ teo : main ] is stronger as the @xmath3 norm is used instead in . in @xcite , averbuch et al . extended the work in @xcite by performing best basis search in the class of adaptive hierarchical local cosine bases .",
    "besides the local cosine transform , adaptive wavelet packets have been used to sparsify the integral operator as well . deng and",
    "ling @xcite applied the best basis algorithm to the integral operator to choose the right one dimensional wavelet packet basis .",
    "golik @xcite independently proposed to apply the best basis algorithm on the right hand side of the integral equation . shortly afterwards ,",
    "deng and ling @xcite gave similar results by using a predefined wavelet packet basis that refines the frequency domain near @xmath0 .",
    "all of these approaches work with the standard form expansion of the integral operator .",
    "recently in @xcite , huybrechs and vandewalle used the best basis algorithm for two dimensional wavelet packets to construct a nonstandard sparse expansion of the integral operator . in all of these results ,",
    "the numbers of nonnegligible coefficients in the expansions were reported to scale like @xmath185 . however",
    ", our result shows that , by using the nonstandard form based on wave atoms , the number of significant coefficients scales like @xmath2 .",
    "most of the approaches on sparsifying in well - chosen bases require the construction of the full integral operator .",
    "since this step itself takes @xmath27 operations , it poses computational difficulty for large @xmath0 values . in @xcite , beylkin et al .",
    "proposed a solution to the related problem of sparsifying the boundary integral operator of the laplace equation .",
    "they successfully avoided the construction of the full integral operator by predicting the location of the large coefficients and applying a special one - point quadrature rule to compute the coefficients .",
    "the corresponding solution for the integral operator of the helmholtz equation is still missing .",
    "there has been a different class of methods , initiated by rokhlin in @xcite , that requires no construction of the integral operator and takes @xmath186 operations in 2d to apply the integral operator .",
    "a common feature of these methods @xcite is that they partition the spatial domain hierarchically with a tree structure and compute the interaction between the tree nodes in a multiscale fashion : whenever two nodes of the tree are well - separated , the interaction ( of the integral operator ) between them is either accelerated either by fourier transform - type techniques @xcite or by directional low rank representations @xcite .",
    "a criticism of the methods in @xcite is that the constant in front of the complexity @xmath184 is often quite high . on the other hand ,",
    "since the fft - based wave atom transforms are extremely efficient , applying the operator in the wave atom frame has a very small constant once the nonstandard sparse representation is constructed .",
    "therefore , for applications where one needs to solve the same helmholtz equation with many different right hand sides , the current approach based on the wave atom basis can offer an competitive alternative . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "one important example is the computation of the radar cross section .",
    "this section contains the proof of theorem [ teo : main ] .",
    "the overarching strategy is to reduce the @xmath3 approximation problem to an estimate of @xmath183 sparsity through a basic result of approximation theory , the direct `` jackson '' estimate @xmath187 where @xmath188 . here",
    "@xmath189 refers to the approximation of @xmath190 where only the @xmath191 largest terms in magnitude are kept , and the others put to zero . the inequality is valid for all values of @xmath192 for which @xmath193 is finite . for a proof , see @xcite , p. 390 .",
    "if the @xmath3 error is to be made less than @xmath4 , it is enough to have @xmath190 in some @xmath183 space , @xmath192 , and take the number of terms defining @xmath189 to be @xmath194 .",
    "the sequence @xmath190 will be split into several fragments that will be studied independently . for each of these fragments @xmath195 in @xmath100 space , the inequality ( [ eq : lambda - ellp ] ) will be complemented by an estimate of the form @xmath196 , for all @xmath197 .",
    "three scenarios will occur in the sequel :    * if @xmath198 then @xmath199 , which is the first term in ( [ eq : cardinality0 ] ) . * if @xmath200 then @xmath201 , which is the second term in ( [ eq : cardinality0 ] ) . * if @xmath202 for arbitrarily small @xmath32 , then @xmath203 , which is the second term in ( [ eq : cardinality1 ] ) .",
