    "stellar bowshock nebulae are arcuate structures created by the interaction between stellar winds and the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) where the relative velocity between the two is supersonic @xcite .",
    "a shock front forms at the interface of the high speed stellar wind and the ambient interstellar medium . the swept up interstellar dust and gas ahead of the high - velocity star forms an arc - like feature preceding the peculiar motion of the star .",
    "this material is most clearly visible in the mid - infrared and sometimes in optical emission lines such as h@xmath2 and @xcite .",
    "most bowshock nebulae are observed around high - velocity massive stars , but they have also been identified preceding high - velocity pulsars @xcite , red supergiants @xcite , and associated with proplyds in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an exact analytic solution for this interaction by balancing the ism pressure and ram pressure of the stellar winds .",
    "based on this model , @xcite used computer simulations to demonstrate that stable bowshocks can be formed for a variety of interaction scenarios over a range of relative velocities , ism densities , and stellar wind momentum fluxes .    a significant proportion ( 10@xmath325% ) of early - type stars",
    "reside outside of stellar clusters @xcite . because of their short main - sequence lifetimes these stars , known as runaway stars , must be moving at high peculiar velocities , typically > 30 km  s@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that o and b type stars ( ob stars ) comprise 50% of all runaway stars , and these ob runaways are dominated by o type stars ( 12:1 ) .",
    "two general scenarios that generate runaway stars have been proposed : close dynamical interactions of either single stars @xcite or binary - binary interactions @xcite , and ejection from close binary systems when the more evolved member undergoes a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analytically simulated the dynamical interactions of small clusters of 56 50 m@xmath5  stars and found that 217% of these stars were ejected from the cluster with velocities in excess of 35 km  s@xmath4 .",

    "studies have shown that the fraction is likely higher than 60% in stellar clusters , meaning that at least 7590% of massive stars are in a multiple system and have the potential to participate in few - body interactions @xcite .",
    "@xcite first proposed that stars that form in close binary systems could be ejected when one of the components explodes as a supernova .",
    "@xcite hydrodynamically simulated the effects of asymmetric ccsn in close binary systems and determined that the less - evolved companion could survive with minimal disruption and be ejected at runaway velocities .",
    "@xcite used monte carlo simulations to determine the necessary impulse to account for the observed velocity distribution of pulsars and found by extension that the necessary forces could accelerate the surviving ob companions to velocities up to 100 km s@xmath4 .",

    "it is likely that both few - body interactions and supernovae in binary systems combine to generate the observed population of runaway stars . using hipparcos proper motions @xcite traced the motions of two known runaway stars , ae aur and @xmath0 col ( o9.5v and o9.5b / b0 , moving in opposite directions at 100 km  s@xmath4 ) to a common origin @xmath12.5 million years ago near the location of the binary pair @xmath7 ori .",

    "@xcite used hipparcos proper motions to trace @xmath8 oph and the pulsar j1932 + 1059 back to the same region of the upper scorpius star forming region @xmath11 myr ago , which could indicate that the two were once members of a common binary prior to the supernova creating the pulsar .",
    "@xcite identified eight additional binary - binary and 16 binary - supernova ejection candidates by extrapolating their proper motions .",
    "a fraction of the ejected stars in the @xcite simulations accreted material from the ccsn , and these simulations predict that atmospheric chemical enrichments may be observable in the runaway stars if mixing is inefficient .",

    "hybrids of these ejection scenarios may also be possible .",
    "@xcite suggested that a two - step scenario involving a dynamically ejected binary pair could accelerate a single runaway star following a ccsn . because of the two kicks accelerating the star in this scenario , the star s observed proper motion vector may not point back to a cluster .",

    "@xcite proposed two additional mechanisms : gravitational interaction between a pair of single stars with a extreme mass ratio or stellar acceleration by a binary smbh system .",
    "however , they predicted that the hvs generation rate by single star interactions is likely low enough to be undetectable due to the extremely small impact parameter required .",

    "@xcite assembled the most complete catalog of hvss with 24 confirmed objects and several additional candidates .",

    "the increased angular resolution of infrared surveys conducted by the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath11 ) and wide - field infrared survey explorer ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , enabled the identification of small collections of bowshock nebulae in both the lmc @xcite and smc @xcite , generated by stars ejected from the star - forming regions ngc 6611 @xcite , cygnus ob2 @xcite , ngc 6357 @xcite , ngc 3603 @xcite , and carina nebula @xcite , and powered by high - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , pulsars @xcite , red @xcite and blue @xcite supergiants , and the a - type star @xmath13 vel @xcite .",

    "this catalog constitutes the largest collection of bowshock nebula candidates by an order of magnitude . in @xcite , we present the results of spectroscopic follow - up of nearly 100 targets , that @xmath1495% of these infrared - selected stellar sources are , in fact , early - type massive stars , and that infrared nebular morphology alone is enough to select massive stars with confidence . in section 2 ,",

    "( @xmath11 ; * ? ? ? * ) and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ? * ) to locate bowshock nebula candidates .",
    "the @xmath15  data included several wide - area surveys conducted using the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) in its 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m bandpasses along with 24 @xmath0 m data from the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "our search used the large mosaics at each waveband constructed by the glimpse team that are available at the spitzer science center .",
    "the @xmath12 data include images at the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath0 m bandpasses which have beamsizes of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0  fwhm , respectively .",
    "our search of the @xmath12 all - sky survey images ( about 460 square degrees of the outer galaxy ) used 1  mosaics in regions along the galactic plane not covered by spitzer and the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg s aladin interface which allows a viewer to rapidly browse large regions of the sky .",
    "given the concentration of bowshock nebulae very near the galactic plane ( section [ loc.sec ] ) , our search of the @xmath12 data concentrated on regions @xmath22 @xmath23 2 , but we also performed a cursory search using the aladin @xcite lite interface up to @xmath22 @xmath23 10 .",
    "only a few objects were discovered beyond @xmath24 @xmath31 .",
    "we searched the @xmath11 mosaics for 1 ) arc - shaped or lima - bean - shaped nebulae at 24 @xmath0 m and/or 8.0 @xmath0 m that had 2 ) a high degree of symmetry with 3 ) at least one prominent star located near the axis of symmetry visible at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "for the majority of candidates , there is a single bright star located along the axis of symmetry ; it constitutes the obvious early - type stellar candidate , even though there is no spectral information available for the vast majority of candidates . in some cases there",
    "are multiple candidate stars within the arc , and in a few cases there are no prominent stellar candidates , especially in the inner galaxy where the stellar density is high and even early type stars may appear faint because they are located at large distances .",
    "our initial visual search team interpreted these three criteria liberally .",
    "the galactic plane exhibits very complex structures at 8.0 and 24 @xmath0 m that vary greatly in surface brightness over small angular scales , producing a large number of initial candidates that do not meet one of more of the three search criteria .",
    "the final decision regarding which objects met all three criteria was ultimately made by the senior author ( hak ) .",
    "relaxing these criteria would substantially increase the candidate list by at least a factor of two .",
    "the search process involved examining color representations of the 4.5 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath0 m images displayed with a square - root color stretch .",
    "owing to the high dynamic range of the mosaics , it was necessary to use a variable maximum and minimum intensity levels to achieve the needed contrast , depending on the surface brightness in each region . often in regions of large dynamic range several different scalings",
    "were used .",
    "this was necessary to find nebulae superimposed on regions with high background levels ( e.g. , within regions ) .",
    "no quantitative thresholds were used in the search process ; indeed , the rms noise levels are not well defined , varying significantly on small spatial scales where regions of very high and very low surface brightness appear adjacent to one another .",
    "the maximum angular size of a detectable candidate is limited by the size of the survey mosaics at about 2 degrees ; in practice , there are no candidates larger than 8.6 .",
    "the angular resolution of the @xmath11/@xmath12 surveys , described above , sets the lower limit on the angular size of detectable candidates .",
    "two or more team members searched each region of the plane . in comparing candidate lists identified by each searcher",
    "we concluded that there was at least a 5075% overlap between the candidate lists .",
    "each searcher identified candidates not found by the others .",
    "we estimate that use of additional searchers could increase the current candidate list , most of this gain coming in areas of the plane dominated by high - surface brightness  regions . a search such as this",
    "can never be deemed `` complete '' given the inherent subjectivity of what constitutes `` arc - shaped '' or `` symmetric '' , especially in regions having large changes in surface brightness over small angular scales where genuine bowshock nebulae may be confused with unrelated foreground or background emission .",
    "all @xmath11 objects were discovered initially in the 24 @xmath0 m bandpasses where emission is either thermal in nature or from ( semi-)stochastic heating of small dust grains . only a minority of the bowshock candidates exhibit morphologically similar counterparts in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band , which predominantly includes a broad solid - state emission feature from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "however , the 8.0 @xmath0 m band may also include a contribution from very hot dust near the sublimation temperature .",
    "our search of the wise images concentrated on the 22 @xmath0 m ( w4 ) band for nebula identification and the 4.6 @xmath0 m ( w2 ) band for identification of a stellar source .",
    "we find that nearly all candidates identified in the w4 band also had counterparts in the 12 @xmath0 m ( w3 ) band , which may include both pah and hot dust emission .",
    "owing to the superior angular resolution of @xmath11 compared to wise ",
    "6.0at 24 @xmath0 m versus 12.0  fwhm at 22 @xmath0 m ",
    "we gave preference to the @xmath11 data ( where available ) and did not search the overlapping @xmath12 images .    because the @xmath12 beamsize is twice that of the @xmath11 at the longest wavelengths , objects that would appear arcuate in @xmath11 imaging might appear circular in @xmath12 and , therefore , be rejected from the catalog .",
    "this leads to a kind of systematic decrease in the completeness ( at fixed angular sizes of 612 ) for the regions surveyed only with @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , we find a large number of small circular 24 @xmath0 m nebulae near the angular resolution limit of @xmath11 that might appear arcuate if viewed under higher angular resolution .",

    "the central stars of the bowshocks are hd  168183 ( o9.5iii+b4v ) , bd@xmath2613  4936 ( b0e ) , bd@xmath2613  4934 ( b1vp ) , and bd@xmath2613  4937 ( b1.5v ) , respectively , all early - type stars .",
    "bd@xmath2613  4937 has a measured proper motion directly _ away _ from the source of radiation in this young star forming region .",
    "these are excellent candidates for `` in - situ '' bowshocks @xcite formed by the interaction between the star s own wind and an outflow from the m  16  region . in regions like this one , bowshocks exhibit a similar orientation not because they share a common space velocity but because a common source of external momentum flux impinges upon them .",
    "there are many other possible `` in - situ '' bowshocks in our sample , and these are flagged by fh in table  [ bigtable.tab ] .    in order to test the hypothesis that bowshock orientations in this field and others may be correlated on small angular scales",
    ", we computed the difference in position angle between each pair of the n=709  nebulae ( n@xmath20(n@xmath261)/2 unique pairings ) and then plotted the mean @xmath39pa versus angular separation in 8  bins in figure  [ structure ] . for comparison to the null hypothesis ( that the position angles are uncorrelated ) we randomly shuffled the position angles among the objects 1000 times and computed the mean @xmath39pa and dispersion in each bin .",
    "figure  [ structure ] plots the data ( blue points ) and the results of the random monte carlo iterations , where the heavy black line depicts the mean difference in position angle .",
    "the thin solid and dashed lines depict the 1@xmath40 and 2@xmath40 deviations about the mean . at small angular separations",
    "@xmath2320   the two blue points lie near the 2@xmath40 envelope , while at larger angular separations the points scatter about the mean expected in the case of random orientations .",
    "this demonstrates that bowshock positions angles are correlated on small angular scales , as would be expected if some are produced by large - scale external influences such as outflows from nearby  regions .",
    "we also investigated whether the bowshock nebulae display preferred orientations in the galactic coordinate system .",
    "figure  [ histpa ] displays a histogram of the morphological position angles , in galactic coordinates , for all 709  objects .",
    "error bars designate poisson uncertainties for each bin .",
    "while the overall distribution is generally consistent with random , there is a small excess of objects at 90  and 270  orientations , parallel to the plane .",
    "figure  [ sizes ] shows a histogram of the base 10 logarithm of the standoff distance , @xmath41 , in arcseconds , describing the separation of the central star from the apsis of the arc - shaped nebula .",
    "the peak of the distribution in the range 512  indicates that the vast majority of the objects are compact , sufficiently small that the angular resolution of @xmath15  is required to discern the arc - like shape of the nebula .",
    "the distribution declines smoothly from 12  to about 50 , beyond which a small number of very large arcs with sizes up to 500  populate the distribution more or less uniformly . on the smaller end of the distribution",
    "the number of objects drops steeply from sizes of 5  to the resolution limit if the irac instrument at about 2 .",
    "figure  [ avr0 ] plots the angular size of the objects , @xmath25 , versus extinction toward the star , @xmath28 , as inferred from the @xmath424.5 @xmath0 m color excess , assuming a standard extinction law with @xmath28= 9@xmath20@xmath43 .",
    "a weak correlation is evident , with the largest nebulae being the least extinguished and the smallest nebulae having preferentially larger extinctions . if extinction of the starlight were a proxy for distance , we might expect that the most extinguished objects would also have the smallest angular sizes , but no strong trends are evident .",
    "figure  [ environ ] depicts the fraction of the bowshock candidate sample that lies in apparently isolated environments ( i ; 70.4% ) , facing  regions ( fh ; 14.5% ) , facing bright - rimmed clouds ( fb ; 8.2% ) , and located within  regions ( h ; 6.9% ) .",
    "many objects designated as fb also lie within regions , so fb may entail h ; fb and h together make up 15.3% of the sample .",
    "isolated objects ( 499 ) make up more than two - thirds of the sample .",
    "however , this designation does not necessarily mean that the object is physically isolated from other potential astrophysical influences .",
    "in the complex regions near the galactic plane , most candidates are seen in projection near dark clouds , star forming regions , and other prominent features .",
    "rather , the isolated designation simply means that the object does not obviously appear to lie within or to directly face a visible region , star or bright - rimmed cloud . as such , these are the best candidates for being genuine runaway stars with space velocities sufficient to sweep up ambient material into an infrared - emitting bowshock nebula .",
    "about 14.6% ( 103 objects ) of the sample exhibits a bowshock orientation that faces a prominent  region within @xmath4410 . in such close proximity , outflows from a hot ionized bubble could plausibly interact with the wind of the ob star , producing an `` in - situ '' type bowshock even if the star does not have a high space velocity .",
    "the association of a bowshock nebulae with a particular region is necessarily speculative , but the relative orientation occurs frequently enough in our sample that the physical nature of this class of objects is highly suggestive .    eight percent ( 58 objects ) of the sample faces a bright - rimmed cloud within several arcminutes .",
    "bright - rimmed features represent the photo - excited surfaces of molecular clouds emitting strongly in the 8.0 @xmath0 m bandpass by virtue of the solid state features of pahs .",
    "they occur commonly at the peripheries of  regions where massive stars create cavities or bubbles in the surrounding gas , e.g , the collection of interstellar bubbles cataloged by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ examples.fb ] shows six objects that face bright - rimmed clouds , with the color scheme as in figure  [ prototypes ] .",
    "frequently , this class of objects is located _ within _ an  region .",
    "physically , this class of objects may arise when an ob star s wind interacts with a photo - ablated flow from the molecular cloud boundary produced by the uv photons from the same star .",
    "the phenomenon may be similar to the stationary shocks visible as ionized arcs at the interface between the wind from @xmath9 ori c and the proplyds in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "figure  3 of @xcite conveniently illustrates the location of one object , proplyd 180 - 331 , that hosts an arc facing the ionization front in the omc1 molecular cloud rather than the facing the star @xmath9 ori c. given that the phenomena operating in our subsample of ir - selected bowshock may be similar , we term this subclass of of in - situ bowshock nebulae `` photo - evaporative flow '' ( pef ) bowshocks .",
    "however , in orion , the arcs are very thin features visible primarily in @xmath45 and , whereas our sample is prominent in the mid - ir dust continuum and the ionization structure is not presently known .",
    "one prediction following from this interpretation is that the pef bowshock candidates , designated here as fb , do not have high space velocities relative to their local environment .",
    "the remaining 7.0% ( 49 objects ) appear to lie within regions or interstellar bubbles , as outlined by either bright - rimmed clouds or by pillars of photo - excited gas .",
    "while they do not obviously face a bright - rimmed cloud at the periphery of the  region , they may be produced where a stellar wind interacts with a high - velocity flow of material , including champagne flows .",
    "even so , these objects may overlap with the fb subsample which are frequently found within  regions .",
    "following the analysis of @xcite , we collected proper motion measurements for the stellar counterparts to each bowshock nebula . in this analysis",
    "we use proper motion data from the hipparcos @xcite , ucac4 @xcite , and the usno b2 @xcite catalogs , in order of preference . of the 709candidates , only 40% ( 286 )",
    "have proper motion data of any kind , and of these only 139 have sufficiently small uncertainties that the proper motion position angles are known to better than 45 . nevertheless , we computed the measured the angle between the nominal orientation angle of the putative bowshock nebula ( column 10 of table  [ bigtable.tab ] ) and the proper motion vector .",
    "figure  [ deltapa ] displays a histogram of this distribution in 45  bins between @xmath26180  and 180 .",
    "error bars depict the uncertainties , taken to be the square root of the number of objects in each bin .",
    "a clear excess in the two bins on either side of zero indicates a preference for proper motions to coincide with the expected direction inferred from the infrared morphology .",
    "this suggests that at least 25% of the objects are good candidates for being runaway stars with high space velocities in the direction of apsis of the infrared arc .",
    "however , the fraction of sources in this plot having relative position angles exceeding @xmath46 is large compared to the sample studied by @xcite . because our sample was selected on the basis of ir morphology rather than on the basis of stars known to have high proper motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not surprising that our sample displays a broader distribution of relative position angles .",
    "the broad distribution of relative position angles may indicate that factors other than a star s peculiar motion could produce relative velocities between a star and the surrounding interstellar material that generate a bowshock nebula .",
    "section  [ env.sec ] above discusses physical scenarios that could explain these objects .",
    "we have compiled the largest collection to date of candidate stellar bowshock nebulae selected on the basis of mid - ir morphology at 24 or 22 @xmath0 m from @xmath15  and @xmath12 sky surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "the vast majority  660  of the 709  objects  are identified here for the first time .",
    "a minority of objects ( @xmath119% ) appear at 8 @xmath0 m or shorter wavelengths as well , indicating a population of very small hot dust grains within the swept - up nebula , or possibly a pah contribution .",
    "while the infrared images alone do not demonstrate that the tabulated objects are necessarily shocks , the preponderance of ancillary evidence , including proper motions and spectral classifications of the host stars , strongly suggests that this is the best interpretation for the majority of objects . on further investigation",
    ", some of the objects may turn out to be other phenomena , such as asymmetric dust shells around evolved stars .",
    "the distribution of these objects on the sky is tightly confined to the galactic mid - plane , consistent with their production by massive stars which have strong stellar winds .",
    "proper motions of the central stars , where known , indicate a clear excess of objects having velocity vectors aligned with the symmetry axis of the infrared nebula .",
    "this is consistent with their production by a population of massive runaway stars . while the majority of the candidate bowshock nebulae and their central stars lie in relatively isolated environments , a substantial subset ( @xmath120% ) either face giant  regions or face bright - rimmed clouds",
    "these may , respectively , constitute two classes of `` in - situ '' bowshocks where either an external flow overruns the star or `` photoevaporative flow '' bowshocks where a stellar wind interacts with material evaporating from a nearby molecular cloud skin .",
    "the correlation of bowshock orientations on angular scales of @xmath610  provides evidence that local environmental phenomena , such as outflows from star forming regions , produce the relative motions between a nearby massive star and the ism that generate the bowshock nebulae .",
    "table  [ bigtable.tab ] and the appendix of 709stellar bowshock candidates may be used to further investigate the origins of runaway stars , phenomena associated with large - scale outflows of gas from star forming regions , and the physics of massive star winds .",
    "additional scrutiny of existing infrared surveys could be expected to find a few additional bowshock candidates , especially at higher galactic latitudes not covered by our search .",
    "however , we expect the yield to be small as the areal density of bowshocks within the @xmath15  plane surveys drops rapidly with latitude . in a forthcoming series of papers we will present an analysis of the characteristics of this comprehensive bowshocks sample , including their spectral types , binarity , distances , spectral energy distributions , and local environments .    our team is grateful to support from the national science foundation through grant ast-1412845 , ast-1411851 , and reu grant ast-1063146 , as well as nasa through grant nnx14ar35a .",

    "<S> we discuss a population of `` in - situ '' bowshocks ( @xmath1103  objects ) that face giant regions where the relative motions between the star and ism may be caused by bulk outflows from an overpressured bubble . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify @xmath158  objects that face 8 @xmath0 m bright - rimmed clouds and apparently constitute a sub - class of in - situ bowshocks where the stellar wind interacts with a photo - evaporative flow from an eroding molecular cloud interface ( i.e. , `` pef bowshocks '' ) . </S>",
