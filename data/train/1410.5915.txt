    "several models of beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics incorporate a kind of parity which protects the dark matter candidate particle ( wimp ) of each model from decay @xcite . the same parity demands continuity of feynman lines of the odd - sector particles in all feynman diagrams .",
    "the lightest odd particle is therefore stable , and if it is to account for dark matter must be neutral .",
    "one may wish to elevate this idea to a principle to guide construction of physics models , but since models incorporating it already exist we will instead examine how this idea has a unifying power to guide us in the bsm exotica searches at lhc .    the natural degree to which this principle is incorporated into the bsm physics models varies . in mssm , it is the r - parity which is a reasonably natural restriction on possible space of couplings , but violating it does not require giving up either gauge or lorentz invariance , or renormalizability . in the kaluza - klein models , for example",
    "ued , the parity is incorporated ad hoc by imposing a boundary condition on wavefunctions in the extra dimension(s ) @xcite . in the string - inspired higher - spin gauge model @xcite",
    ", the parity is a natural consequence of requiring all interaction vertices of matter and gauge bosons to be dimension-4 operators with gauge structure identical to the sm , and lorentz structure extended with the odd - sector spin 2 gauge bosons and spin 3/2 matter .    in all these models ,",
    "the sm is enriched with odd - sector partner particles which have the same gauge quantum numbers as the progenitor sm particles , but have spin lower by 1/2 in susy mssm , equal spin in kaluza - klein ued models , and spin higher by integer 1,2 , ... in the higher - spin model whose origin is stringy . in all models obeying the parity principle ,",
    "odd - sector particles are created only in pairs , and decay via a chain ending on the wimp .",
    "if we take the point of view that the dark matter wimp must be an odd partner of some sm particle , it does not yet follow that it is neutrino - like .",
    "for example , in mssm , the lsp is typically a partner of another neutral particle , either a photino @xcite or more generally a neutralino @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this work we suggest lhc searches where the dark matter particle is assumed to be a partner of the neutrino and its stability is assured by some parity principle which also implies the existence of an entire odd - sector of partners of the sm particles .",
    "thus , in mssm there is possibility of a sneutrino wimp @xcite . in kaluza - klein theory",
    "the wimp may be the heavy partner of the neutrino @xcite , and in the higher - spin model @xcite it is the spin 3/2 heavy partner of the neutrino .",
    "the requirement that the wimp is neutral strongly limits the possibilities and mass hierarchy in these models @xcite .",
    "considerations based on relic abundance disfavor the sm - strength couplings of the neutrino - partner wimp in mssm and kk ued model , so that additional tuning is required @xcite . the same considerations in the higher - spin model lead to a range of viable wimp mass of @xmath0 with majorana wimp @xcite .    we proceed to classify in turn the dominant detection channels at the hadron collider from this point of view .",
    "+    * p , p @xmath1 invisible * can proceed via z , producing a pair of wimps which escape undetected .",
    "lep ii has placed limit on this up to a mass of @xmath2 due to the influence of the invisible width on the visible line shape of the z resonance . at lhc , and with even much higher assumed wimp mass , the cross - section is sizable but is observable only in combination with initial state radiation which we consider next .    *",
    "p , p @xmath1 1 jet or photon + @xmath3 * has emerged as the golden channel for dm search at lhc @xcite .",
    "feynman diagram typically responsible for this is fig .",
    "[ fig : monojet ] a ) and b ) .",
    "this channel is currently analyzed in a model - independent way @xcite , in terms of an effective four - fermion interaction as in fig .",
    "[ fig : monojet ] b ) .",
    "the experiment places a combined limit on the wimp mass and the strength of the effective interaction @xmath4 .",
    "this interaction presumably requires existence of a new boson of mass @xmath5 to carry this interaction , the current limits on @xmath6 and @xmath7 being excluded in a more or less rectangular region up to @xmath8 by recent atlas data @xcite .    from the parity - principle point of view",
    ", the interaction can not be due to an odd - sector boson ( at least at tree - level ) , so that z exchange is the preferred possibility .",
    "unfortunately , in this regime , z acts like a light particle so that any effective four - fermion description is not possible .",
    "the wimp pair creation channel gives only a small excess over the dominant and irreducible sm background which is @xmath9 . in this case , the experimental limits are weakened dramatically , as already argued by the authors of @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that the systematic uncertainties will allow for absolute calibration of this channel to 3 - 5% accuracy which is required to make a discovery , no matter what the ultimate integrated luminocity will be achieved .",
    "total acceptance - corrected cross sections are presented in table [ tab : xs ] at 8 tev and table [ tab : xs1000 ] at 13 tev .",
    "specific predictions for the @xmath3 distribution of events is given in fig [ fig : monojet ] in the ued spin 1/2 and higher spin model for spin 3/2 neutrino - like wimp .",
    "in mssm toy model with only a slepton partner multiplet with all interactions dictated by the gauge principle , or in the full mssm , in the corner of parameter space where only sneutrino and selectron play a role , the abundance looks like this :     +   +    recently , some models of sneutrino dark matter have emerged in which a left - right symmetric extension is assumed , such that the sneutrino is a viable dark matter candidate if it is predominantly consists of the right - handed , sterile component @xcite . in our analysis , it is assumed that the lightest s - neutrino is predominantly of a single flavor and that co - annihilation with other mssm particles does not play a role .",
    "it is apparent from from the plot that the abundance is sizable @xmath10 for a range of mass roughly in the region 60 - 400 gev , and in this region the toy model can be extended with the right - handed sterile s - neutrino such that the mixing provides a lower coupling to the z , due to a mixing angle which is not unnaturally small .",
    "nevertheless , we do not in fact make this elaboration , so that the left - handed neutrino couples to the z with full strength , which makes our collider result strictly an upper bound .    in the case of",
    "the kk dirac heavy spin 1/2 neutrinos , the abundance does not reach the cosmologically relevant value @xcite , but in the majorana case it is typically larger @xcite and comes close near 80 - 90 gev as in fig .",
    "[ fig : abundance]b .",
    "furthermore , it was found in @xcite that the abundance in the case of majorana spin 3/2 neutrino - like wimp reaches the cosmological value and is a viable candidate in the range of mass 70 - 160 gev which allows for the recently discovered 130 gev monochromatic line by fermi - lat .",
    "the direct detection limits in this case are satisfied , and it was found that the current generation of xenon experiments are sensitive enough to confirm or rule out this model due to their content of odd - neutron isotopes .",
    "the monte - carlo generation of events was done with calchep , cteq6 m distributions and at 4 + 4=8tev . + * monojet * the total crosssection of the irreducible sm contribution with @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath13 fb .    this crosssection is reported after including the cuts so acceptance is taken into account , but not efficiency , which is in any case high at 83% average as reported by atlas .",
    ".the various mono - jet crosssections with cuts on @xmath11 and @xmath14 corresponding to the atlas signal region sr3 at 8tev .",
    "all of these numbers should be scaled down by efficiency which is reported by atlas to be around 83% in their detector and parameters of their analysis .",
    "the estimate on the systematical error is based on extrapolation of the 2011 atlas analysis . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it seems that the case of a heavy wimp with coupling to matter primarily through the z is not very favorable for discovery in the monojet and monophoton channel , since there is now evidence that the precision of a hadron collider is not sufficient for this no matter how large is the total integrated luminosity .",
    "the optimistic situation arises only if the wimp has for one reason or another a hard tail in pt .",
    "one is the four - fermi effective interaction which has been extensively studied , and the other , considered in this paper , where the wimp is a spin 3/2 partner of the neutrino .",
