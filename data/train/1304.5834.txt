    "note also that the vacuum state does not change under @xmath219 , i.e. , @xmath220 .",
    "the anharmonic interactions couple the position operators of the three species . using dimensionless position coordinate defined in , the position operator @xmath221 is related to the @xmath8 by @xmath222 .",
    "the anharmonic interactions then take the form @xmath223 in this situation , we find that aside from the @xmath224 resonant mode , there is a second resonant mode that occurs at a higher frequency @xmath225 compared to @xmath224 , @xmath226 this mode is initiated by the interaction terms @xmath227 , where @xmath228 denotes hermitian conjugate .",
    "if the occupation number of the @xmath225 mode in the field is small enough then this mode is not excited .",
    "this could be achieved if the temperature of the bath , @xmath106 , is low enough so that the condition @xmath229 is satisfied , where @xmath230 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "another way to achieve this is to formally impose a high frequency cut - off @xmath231 to the form factor @xmath232 in the interaction so that @xmath233 is satisfied .",
    "both conditions are separately consistent with the @xmath29-approximation @xcite , or the born - markov approximation @xcite , used to derive the markovian master equation of the system .",
    "condition implies that @xmath4 should be of the same order , since @xmath234 for small @xmath106 , whereas condition implies that they should not be too small , since we require @xmath235 for a large cut - off frequency . in the latter situation , since @xmath236 and @xmath237 are not small , only a few lower energy modes will be excited in the dynamics , see for the energy levels of the system .    aside from the resonant modes ,",
    "there are two other virtual modes that involve the field quanta with negative frequencies , i.e. , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "they are initiated by the interaction terms @xmath240 and @xmath241 of , respectively .",
    "the @xmath242 mode is a fast rotating mode so that its contribution to the reduced dynamics averages to zero in the relaxation time scale , @xmath243 , where the @xmath29-approximation is valid .",
    "this is the rotating - wave approximation @xcite usually implemented in the markovian limit .",
    "the virtual mode @xmath244 does not contribute to the reduced dynamics on the level of the @xmath29-approximation with the collision operator @xmath245 defined in .",
    "a similar example is provided by ref .   for the reduced dynamics of a single oscillator coupled to a field ,",
    "in which the interactions contain a virtual transition mode .",
    "the effect of a possible extension of the collision operator @xmath245 to include the contribution of the virtual transitions is presented in the next appendix .",
    "it is also interesting to note that if instead of assuming @xmath246 in our discussion so far , the opposite situation @xmath247 would interchange the role played by the @xmath244 and the @xmath224 modes , i.e. , now @xmath224 becomes a virtual mode , whereas @xmath244 becomes a resonant mode .",
    "however , the @xmath225 and @xmath242 modes are not affected by this change .    in summary , in comparison to the full anharmonic interactions , the higher frequency resonant mode @xmath225",
    "is not included in the interaction hamiltonian of the system we consider here .",
    "the contribution of this mode is negligible compared to the @xmath224 mode at low temperature , or when a frequency cut - off is imposed to the form factor below @xmath225 .",
    "moreover , out of the two virtual modes we have discussed , the effect of the @xmath242 mode is effectively dropped under the rotating - wave approximation , whereas the @xmath244 mode does not affect the dissipative part of the reduced dynamics using the usual definition of the collision operator .",
    "it is one of the diagrams giving the contribution to the collision operator @xmath248 when virtual mode @xmath244 is considered .",
    "the operators on the right vertex cause the virtual transition.,width=230 ]    using the usual definition of the collision operator up to the second order in the coupling constant @xcite , @xmath249 the virtual mode @xmath244 does not contribute to the collision operator on the level of @xmath29-approximation .",
    "however , if we incorporate the transitions between different @xmath250 subspaces into the definition of the collision operator , the virtual mode @xmath244 may contribute to the dissipative part of the reduced dynamics as follows .",
    "we define the collision operator by @xmath251 , where @xmath252 .",
    "shows an example of a possible transition of @xmath253 that involves different @xmath250 subspaces . as indicated in the figure , the interaction vertex on the right is due to the virtual transition @xmath254 , whereas the vertex on the left is due to a real transition mode in the original model .",
    "a standard calculation shows that contributes a term @xmath255 to the dissipative part of the reduced dynamics , in addition to the contributions by the real transitions .",
    "when taking into account all these additional transitions , the terms @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 and their hermitian conjugates , are added to the dissipative operator , resulting in a not completely positive reduced dynamics @xcite .",
    "we note that this extension to the definition of the collision operator does not affect the reduced dynamics of the original model , since all the possible transitions in this model involve the same @xmath250 subspace .",
    "we already learned that in this situation they lead to a completely positive reduced dynamics @xcite with the kossakowski - lindblad form .",
    "in this appendix , we show that @xmath73 is invariant under a rotation along the @xmath53 axis .",
    "indeed , we find that @xmath259 by using the commutation relations @xmath260=2l_0 $ ] and @xmath261=\\pm l_\\pm$ ] . since @xmath262 and @xmath263 appear pairwise in @xmath73 , cf .  - , the phase in cancels out .",
    "added by the fact that @xmath53 commutes with @xmath24 , we conclude that @xmath73 is invariant under the rotation .",
    "the su(2 ) generalized coherent states @xcite , @xmath265 reside in the corresponding @xmath76 subspace of the system , where @xmath266 , in which @xmath267 are the parameters that label the coherent states . in terms of the @xmath76 basis , we have    @xmath268",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the effect of @xmath142 on the @xmath160 basis . since @xmath53 and @xmath24 commute",
    ", we have @xmath269 using , we find that @xmath270 therefore , @xmath271 , since @xmath262 and @xmath263 appear pairwise in @xmath69 , and @xmath24 commutes with @xmath272 . furthermore",
    ", using @xmath273=\\pm(2l_0\\mp 1)l_\\pm=\\pm l_\\pm(2l_0\\pm 1)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can show that @xmath274 where @xmath275 . using the relation ,",
    "we finally obtain .",
    "therefore , @xmath142 differs from @xmath69 by a phase factor in two of the terms . for basis vectors that lie in the probability subspace , @xmath276 , and we get @xmath277 .",
