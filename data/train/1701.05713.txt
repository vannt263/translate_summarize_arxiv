    "understanding the dissipative quantum dynamics of a system embedded in a complex environment is an important topic across various sub - disciplines of physics and chemistry .",
    "significant progress in the understanding of condensed phase dynamics has been achieved within the context of a few prototypical models@xcite such as caldeira - leggett model and spin - boson model .",
    "the environment is often modeled as a bosonic bath characterized with a spectral density , from which bath - induced decoherence can be deduced .",
    "this prevalent adoption of bosonic baths is based on following considerations : ( 1 ) the simple mathematical tractability of a gaussian bath model , ( 2 ) the linear response of an environment is often sufficient to account for quantum dissipations and ( 3 ) the spectral density can be extracted from the classical molecular dynamics simulations    despite the above - mentioned merits , there exists scenarios in which the `` bosonization '' of an environment is inadequate .",
    "for instance , the electron - transfer reaction in condensed phase is often approximated with the spin boson model .",
    "the abstract model treats the generic quantum environment as a set of harmonic oscillators , which corresponds to taking only linear response of solvent effects outside a solvation shell while imposing a  harmonic approximation \" on the vibrations modes inside the shell .",
    "the anharmonicity and higher - order nonlinear response can be substantial when the donor - acceptor complex is strongly coupled to some low - frequency vibrational modes or present in a nonpolar liquids . to better understand the anharmonic effects of the environment , several groups including ours@xcite have studied correlation functions of anharmonic oscillators and a generalized spin boson model with a bath of independent morse or quartic oscillators .",
    "similarly , a spin bath can be viewed as an extreme limit of anharmonic oscillators and provides additional insights into condensed phase dynamics .    on the other hand ,",
    "physical spin bath models , corresponding to localized electron and/or nuclear spins , have received increased attentions due to ongoing interests in developing various solid - state quantum technologies @xcite under the ultralow temperature regime when interactions with the phonons or vibrational modes are strongly suppressed . for these spin - based environments ,",
    "the spectral density is no longer a convenient characterization of the bath . instead",
    ", each bath spin is explicitly specified with parameters @xmath3 , the intrinsic energy scale and the system - bath coupling coefficients , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate corrections to the standard linear response treatment of quantum dissipations induced by a spin bath@xcite . to quantitatively capture these higher order responses , we utilize our recently proposed generalized hierarchical equation of motion ( gheom ) method@xcite to incorporate higher order cumulants of an influence functional into an extended heom framework@xcite through a stochastic formulation . even though it is possible to derive the gheom directly through the path integral influence functional approach@xcite",
    ", we emphasize that the stochastic approach provides an extension to additional methodology developments such as hybrid deterministic - stochastic algorithms@xcite .",
    "this is a direction we are pursuing . due to the enormous numerical efforts needed to generate accurate long - time results , we restrict the numerical illustrations in the short - time limit .",
    "recently , our group@xcite and others have proposed methods to construct the memory kernel of a generic bath from numerically exact short - time dynamical results .",
    "hence , the gheom provides an invaluable tool to capture the anharmonicity and non - gaussian effects of a generic quantum environment when used along with these other methods to correctly reproduce long - time results .",
    "furthermore , starting from the stochastic formalism or the gheom , it also serves as a starting point to derive master equations@xcite incorporating these higher order nonlinear effects and can be more efficiently solved to extract long - time results .",
    "as alluded earlier , we cover both scenarios : the spin bath as a specific realization of an anharmonic condensed - phase environment and the physical spin bath . in this work , we always explicitly take a spin bath as a collection of finite number of spins . for physical spin bath models ,",
    "this restriction reflects the reality that there could only be a finite number of spins in the surrounding environment . for an anharmonic condensed phase environment , if we simply take the spin bath as a realization of an infinitely large heat bath then it has been rigorously shown@xcite that all higher order response function must vanish in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand ,",
    "if we perform atomic simulation of solvents in a condensed phase , the anharmonicity can probably be attributed to a few prominent degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , we restrict the number of bath spins in order to probe the effects of higher order response functions",
    ". many earlier studies@xcite on the spin bath focused on the thermodynamic limit and restricted to analyze the linear response only .",
    "some interesting phenomena include more coherent population dynamics@xcite in the nonadiabatic regime at elevated temperature and the onset of negative thermal conductivity@xcite in a molecular junction coupled to two large spin baths held at different temperatures . in app .",
    "[ app : linear - resp ] , we report our own investigation on differences between a spin bath and a bosonic bath in the linear response limit when the spin bath can be accurately mapped onto an effective bosonic bath .    in this work ,",
    "the main difference between the two types of environment comes down to how the parameters @xmath4 are assigned to each bath spin as explained later . in general",
    ", we find the anharmonicity is more pronounced at the low - frequency end when the spectral density for condensed phase environment is the commonly used ohmic form",
    ". therefore , a slow spin bath at low temperature could potentially pose the most difficulty for a linear response treatment of the bath . on the other hand , for a physical spin bath model , highly non - markovian and persistent dynamics@xcite emerge under a combination of narrowly distributed bath parameters and highly symmetrical system - bath hamiltonians . to accurately reproduce these results",
    "might require taking higher order response of the spin bath into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : anharmonicity ] , we introduce the spin bath models of interest . in sec.[sec : method ] , we provide a brief account of the stochastic formalism@xcite and how to use it to derive the gheom with a systematic inclusion of higher order cumulants of an influence functional . in sec.[sec",

    "the first form is appropriate for modelling condensed - phase environment , while the second form is useful in the decoherence study in quantum computing and related contexts .",
    "one simple - model approach to investigate anharmonicity of a condensed - phase environment is to generalize the typical bosonic bath by substituting harmonic oscillators with the quartic oscillators or morse oscillators@xcite .",

    "the mapping of a generic anharmonic environment onto a spin bath is more universal than the specific example of morse oscillators .",
    "a general approach to achieve the mapping is to formulate an influence functional of the bath then perform a cumulant expansion , which characterizes the bath - induced decoherence through multi - time correlation functions .",
    "one then has a clear set of criteria to construct a spin bath to reproduce the bath s response up to a specific cumulant expansion order .",
    "this is achievable as a set of spins ( or qubits ) constitute a versatile quantum simulator@xcite that can simulate other simple quantum systems .      in the present context ,",
    "the spin bath is not just a conceptual model but represent the actual spin - based environment composed of nuclear / electron spins in the surrounding medium of a physical system .",
    "depending on details regarding a system , spin - spin interactions could take on a number of different forms such as the ising , flip - flop ( or xx ) and heisenberg interactions in eq .",

    ". the bath could be potentially too small for semi - classical approximation and too large for a full dynamical simulations .",
