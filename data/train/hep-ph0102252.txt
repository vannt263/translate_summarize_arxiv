    "at present , there are three indications in favour of neutrino oscillations @xcite , namely the solar @xmath2 deficit @xcite , the atmospheric @xmath3 @xcite deficit and the result of the lsnd experiment @xcite hinting at @xmath4 transitions . whereas",
    "in the case of the first two indications several experiments agree on the existence of the effect , the third indication is found only by the lsnd collaboration .",
    "therefore , in many analyses the lsnd result is left out . however",
    ", if all three indications in favour of neutrino oscillations are confirmed , for three mass - squared differences of different orders of magnitude ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 , @xmath7 ev@xmath8 , @xmath9 ev@xmath8 ) one needs a minimum of four neutrinos , three active ones and a sterile one @xcite . in that case",
    "a major revision of our picture of the lepton sector of the elementary particles would be necessary , with a mixing between the active and the sterile neutrinos ; i.e. , @xmath10 if we stick to the minimum of four neutrinos . in eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) the left - handed flavour fields are denoted by @xmath11 and the left - handed mass eigenfields by @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath14 is assumed to be unitary .",
    "one of the most important issues in the context of 4-neutrino scenarios is the question of the 4-neutrino mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "there are two different spectral classes with very different properties : the first class contains four types and consists of spectra where three neutrino masses are clustered together , whereas the fourth mass is separated from the cluster by the mass gap needed to reproduce the lsnd result ; the second class has two types where two pairs of nearly degenerate masses are separated by the lsnd gap .",
    "these two classes have been dubbed ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2)-neutrino mass spectra , respectively @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two classes is that , if a ( 2 + 2)-spectrum is realized in nature , the transition into the sterile neutrino is a solution of either the solar or the atmospheric neutrino problem , or the sterile neutrino has to take part in both , whereas with a ( 3 + 1)-spectrum it could be only slightly mixed with the active neutrinos and mainly provide a description of the lsnd result .",
    "it has been argued in the literature @xcite that the ( 3 + 1)-spectra are strongly disfavoured by the data , whereas the ( 2 + 2)-spectra are the preferred ones , in agreement with all data showing evidence for neutrino oscillations and also with those where no such evidence has been found .",
    "recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite this statement has been challenged because in the latest lsnd analysis the allowed region in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , where @xmath1 is the lsnd transition amplitude , has undergone a slight shift towards smaller mass - squared differences , which makes the ( 3 + 1)-spectra somewhat less disfavoured . furthermore , in a 2-neutrino analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations the super - kamiokande data prefer @xmath15 conversion over @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is some debate also in the solar neutrino problem whether the @xmath17 transition is disfavoured in comparison with other solutions @xcite , though such a feature seems not to be borne out by a global analysis of the data @xcite . in any case , moving away from pure 2-neutrino considerations in the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems , transitions into active  sterile superpositions @xcite give viable solutions to both problems within the ( 2 + 2)-spectral schemes , with features which will be tested in the future @xcite .",
    "the arguments presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , which disfavour the ( 3 + 1)-mass spectra , are based on exclusion curves from short - baseline ( sbl ) experiments , and solar and atmospheric neutrino data enter into this simplified analysis only through inequalities .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that its parameters are confined to the quantities are used instead . ] @xmath18 and the sbl or lsnd mass - squared difference @xmath0 . for definiteness",
    "we assume that the mass separated by the lsnd gap is @xmath19 and , therefore , @xmath20 .",
    "it has turned out that the up - down asymmetry of atmospheric multi - gev @xmath21-like events measured in the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite is very suitable to constrain @xmath22 @xcite , whereas from the solar data it follows that @xmath23 must be small .",
    "the probability of sbl @xmath24 transitions is given by the two - neutrino - like formula @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance between source and detector and @xmath27 is the neutrino energy and @xmath28 the lsnd experiment gives an allowed region in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .    however , the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite are not based on a well - defined statistical procedure .",
    "therefore , they remain on a semi - quantitative level and do not allow to assess a confidence level ( cl ) which quantifies the degree at which the ( 3 + 1)-spectra are excluded .    in this paper",
    "we make a step forward towards such an assessment .",
    "the main points to achieve our goal are the following :    * the aim is to arrive , for every sbl mass - squared difference @xmath0 , at a probability distribution solely in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath22 ; a suitable method for this purpose is given by the likelihood function in combination with the bayesian approach ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "we make full use of the data of the sbl bugey @xcite , cdhs @xcite and karmen @xcite experiments through the likelihood function . * in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , all information pertaining to the atmospheric and solar mass - squared differences is included via inequalities . within our probabilistic framework",
    "we are able to treat inequalities as prior probabilities or with a kind of a maximum likelihood method . * in this way we treat the inequality following from the atmospheric up - down asymmetry and , similarly , we include also the result of the chooz experiment @xcite ; the solar neutrino data allow a simpler treatment in the context of the bugey data @xcite , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . * eventually , for every given sbl @xmath0 and any cl @xmath29 , we are able to calculate an upper bound @xmath30 on the transition amplitude @xmath1 , and we can compare such bounds @xmath30 with the 90% and 99% cl regions in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane found by the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "in the same framework we will also discuss the ( 2 + 2)-spectra .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ uda ]",
    "we rederive the atmospheric up - down inequality @xcite in a form which is suitable for our purpose . in section [ b+l ]",
    "we introduce the likelihood function and the bayesian approach , and describe how to incorporate inequalities ; we apply the methods developed there to the chooz result and the atmospheric up - down inequality . in section [ plots ]",
    "we explain how we calculate bounds on @xmath1 and discuss each of the sbl experiments we use , together with their features which are important in this context .",
    "details of technical nature are deferred to the appendix .",
    "our main result , represented as a plot in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , is also given in this section .",
    "in section [ 2 + 2 ] we consider the ( 2 + 2)-spectra in the framework of our statistical approach and in section [ concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the most convincing evidence for @xmath3 disappearance in atmospheric neutrino experiments is given by the so - called up - down asymmetry @xmath31 measured by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite , where @xmath14 and @xmath32 refer to the number of up - going and down - going @xmath21-like multi - gev events , respectively . quoting the number for fully contained events , after 1289 days of operation",
    "the result @xmath33 was found @xcite .",
    "adding statistical and systematic error in quadrature , one obtains @xmath34 because of the smallness of the systematic error this value is identical with the statistical error .",
    "let us now rederive the atmospheric up - down inequality @xcite . in the following we will not indicate antineutrinos but our arguments will hold for both , neutrinos and antineutrinos . with the assumption that downward - going atmospheric neutrinos do not oscillate with the frequency associated with @xmath35 and that oscillations according to @xmath0 are averaged out , we obtain @xmath36 denoting the number of muon ( electron ) neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in the atmosphere by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , it follows from eq .",

    "( [ a ] ) . since @xmath42 ( [ aud ] ) is a monotonously decreasing function in @xmath14 , using eqs .",
    "( [ d ] ) and ( [ u ] ) we obtain the so - called up - down inequality for @xmath21-like atmospheric events @xmath43 in this equation we have defined @xmath44 .",
    "the numerical value @xmath45 can be read off from fig .  3 in ref .",
    "@xcite of the super - kamiokande collaboration . with similar arguments one can also find an upper bound @xmath46 hence",
    ", the up - down asymmetry is confined to the interval @xmath47    some remarks are at order . our inequality ( [ g ] ) is a little different from the analogous inequality in ref .",
    "@xcite , because in the present case we have not eliminated @xmath23 ; this is useful because our aim is to derive a probability distribution in @xmath23 and @xmath22 ( see next section ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath48 has a slight dependence on the atmospheric zenith angle which is neglected here ; however , since @xmath23 is confined to rather small values @xcite by the result of the bugey experiment @xcite , the terms containing @xmath48 are rather unimportant numerically . the assumptions for deriving eqs .",
    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ h ] ) are not exactly fulfilled : for down - going neutrinos with zenith angles around @xmath49 , oscillations according to small sbl mass - squared differences @xmath0 around 0.2 ev@xmath8 are not completely averaged out ; for down - going neutrinos with zenith angles close to @xmath50 , oscillations according to @xmath35 do occur already , if the atmospheric mass - squared difference is large .",
    "we have checked that both effects do not change numerically the bound @xmath51 by more than a few percent in the worst case .",
    "finally , matter effects , which are important for up - going neutrinos , do not affect the inequalities ( [ pu ] ) and thus also not the inequality for @xmath14 .",
    "( [ g ] ) is , therefore , a well - established inequality which restricts mainly the allowed range of @xmath22 . due to",
    "( [ a ] ) , it will be used in the following to constrain the sbl amplitude @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a suitable method for the purpose of deriving a probability distribution in the variables @xmath23 and @xmath22 is given by the likelihood function combined with the bayesian approach , which is defined as follows .",
    "suppose one has a series of measurements @xmath52 and @xmath48 parameters @xmath53 to be estimated .",
    "then the bayesian approach allows to construct a `` posterior '' probability density in the parameter space via ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "we assume that the values of measurements of @xmath58 are distributed according to a gaussian distribution @xmath61\\ ] ] around the true value .",
    "suppose further that from some theoretical consideration we have the knowledge that the true value @xmath60 is bounded by @xmath62 we conceive the true value @xmath60 , which is otherwise unknown , as a parameter in our scenario and assign to it a prior probability density @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the heaviside function .",
    "due to lack of further knowledge , we have assumed a flat prior probability density .",
    "since we are not interested in a posterior probability density in the parameter @xmath60 we perform the integral @xmath65 with @xmath66 where we have made use of the error function defined by @xmath67 the function ( [ lz ] ) represents then the relevant factor in the posterior probability density which takes into account the inequality ( [ priorknow ] ) .    to check if we have been lead to a meaningful expression ( [ lz ] ) , we want to discuss the behaviour of this function . following from @xmath68 , we find that for @xmath69 we have @xmath70 to a very good approximation , and for @xmath71 or @xmath72 we have @xmath73 . in this discussion , `` much smaller '' or `` much larger '' is defined in units of @xmath74 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath74 becomes negligibly small , the function @xmath75 approaches a step function with @xmath76 being the height of the step .",
    "the edges of the step are smoothened out by a finite @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we will have a maximal contribution to the posterior probability density for @xmath77 well inside the interval @xmath78 $ ] , whereas for @xmath77 well outside the interval @xmath78 $ ] the function @xmath75 is very close to zero .",
    "thus we can be confident that the inequality ( [ priorknow ] ) is reasonably well taken into account by our procedure .",
    "again we depart from eqs .",

    "are allowed by the up - down inequality .",
    "therefore , in @xmath137 we do not neglect @xmath138 in the survival amplitude because this would not be justified .    in the karmen experiment , @xmath139 transitions have not been observed and the karmen exclusion curve @xcite cuts right through the region allowed by lsnd .",
    "therefore , it is important to take into account the karmen result in our analysis . for the details of our fit to the karmen data and the analogous details concerning the bugey and cdhs experiments see appendix [ app ] .",
    "we include the chooz result in our analysis for @xmath140 ev@xmath8 , where the bound on @xmath141 in the chooz plots is a straight line @xcite ; this guarantees that oscillations with the sbl @xmath0 are averaged out and hence eq .",

    "as expected , for large @xmath0 the solid line of our exclusion curve follows rather well the karmen exclusion curve , whereas for small @xmath0 it tends to follow the bugey curve . due to the inclusion of the chooz result above 0.05 ev@xmath8 ,",
    "the solid line is more restrictive there than the bugey curve , whereas below 0.05 ev@xmath8 both curves are nearly identical .",
    "we have also investigated the exclusion curve of the ( 2 + 2)-spectra within the bayesian approach to inequalities of section [ ba ] . in this approach",
    "we have more freedom to make `` reasonable '' choices for priors than in the ( 3 + 1)-case , and , numerically , the @xmath1 bounds tend to be a little more restrictive than the solid line in fig .  [ plot2 ] .",
    "in this paper we have examined the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2)-classes of the 4-neutrino mass spectra within a rigorous statistical analysis . since we do not have sufficient information concerning the final lsnd data @xcite , we have chosen the approach to analyse all other available data and compare our result with the lsnd result in a @xmath0@xmath1 plot .",
    "this approach suggests to extract that information from the solar and atmospheric data which is most relevant for sbl oscillations with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "this extraction is most appropriately done in the form of inequalities involving elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "similarly , we have extracted the `` sbl information '' contained in the chooz result . on the other hand , concerning the sbl experiments , we have fully included the data of the bugey , cdhs and karmen experiments .    since",
    "our aim has been to incorporate in the statistical analysis the atmospheric up - down inequality , eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) or ( [ g ] ) , and the chooz inequality ( [ choozineq ] ) , we have made use of the likelihood function in combination with the bayesian approach to probability which allows us to derive probability distributions of the parameters which are to be estimated . in this context we have presented two possibilities for including inequalities involving parameters : one way is to treat them in the form of prior probability densities for which a `` reasonable choice '' has to be made ; another way is a kind of maximum likelihood treatment .",
    "numerically , we have compared both methods for exclusion curves in the case of the ( 3 + 1)-spectra and found that the difference is negligible .    with the method described in the paper we have obtained for every @xmath0 a probability distribution for the sbl transition amplitude @xmath1 , from which we could derive bounds as a function of @xmath0 on this amplitude for any cl . the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ plot1 ] and [ plot2 ] for the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2)-neutrino mass spectra , respectively . in the latter case",
    "our 90% cl exclusion curve is close to the karmen exclusion curve down to @xmath166 ev@xmath8 ; there it turns off and starts to come close to the exclusion curve given by the bugey data .",
    "thus , for the ( 2 + 2)-spectra our method reproduces more or less what one obtains by naively comparing the karmen and bugey exclusion curves with the region allowed by lsnd .",
    "therefore , these spectra are well compatible with all the data . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of the ( 3 + 1)-spectra , our 95% cl bound has no overlap with the lsnd region of 99% cl .",
    "we , therefore , come to the conclusion that this spectral class is rather unlikely , even with the recent change in the lsnd region .",
    "thus we strengthen with the method presented here the claims made in refs .",
    "should the lsnd result be confirmed by the miniboone collaboration @xcite , then , in a 4-neutrino scheme , the sterile neutrino should make its appearance either in the solar or atmospheric neutrinos , or both .",
    "we thank c. giunti and s.m .",
    "bilenky for many useful discussions .",

    "here we want to elucidate the relationship between the methods for the inclusion of inequalities introduced in sections [ ba ] and [ mla ] . in the bayesian approach to this problem we consider in general integrals of the type @xmath167 = \\int_a^b dz l_z(z ) \\pi(z ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is given by eq .",

    "such a sequence is easy to give : any sequence @xmath176 , for which @xmath178 for @xmath179 holds , fulfills our purpose .",
    "for @xmath180 we proceed analogously .",
    "if @xmath181 $ ] , the upper bound on @xmath175 is @xmath182 .",
    "the sequence @xmath176 is constructed accordingly with the idea given before .",

    "thus the expression @xmath172 is obtained from the bayesian approach as the maximum over all possible priors .",
    "sloppily speaking , the prior in @xmath175 , which gives @xmath172 , is a delta function ( @xmath185 , @xmath186 or @xmath187 ) ; however , in order to choose the correct delta function one has to know the experimental value @xmath77 and , therefore , such a function does not deserve the name `` prior '' anymore . though @xmath188 holds , it is not obvious which method gives the stronger constraint in an actual situation , because one has additional factors in the probability distribution one aims at , coming from additional data , and one has to normalize the combined distribution ( see eq .",
