    "topological insulators ( tis ) are a new class of materials @xcite with an insulating bulk but with a conducting surface state .",
    "the surface state has its spin locked to the momentum in a dirac - like energy spectrum .",
    "superconducting ti surfaces have received a lot of attention recently , @xcite since it was predicted that majorana modes appear in e.g.  superconducting vortex cores and at superconductor - ferromagnet ( sf ) interfaces.@xcite experimentally , both superconducting transport@xcite as well as the josephson effect@xcite have already been demonstrated in tis proximity - coupled to conventional superconductors . despite this large interest ,",
    "relatively little attention has been paid to the superconducting state itself .",
    "in addition to the standard proximity effect , one could expect the spin - orbit coupling in tis to lead to significant modifications and produce novel superconducting states that are not easily accessible in conventional superconductors .",
    "for example , it has already been demonstrated that an effective @xmath1-wave pairing is induced when the ti is proximity - coupled to a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor.@xcite    quite generally , the superconducting pair amplitude , being the wave function of the cooper pairs , needs to obey fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "this leads to the traditional classification into even - parity ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 , ... ) spin - singlet and odd - parity ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 , ... ) spin - triplet pairing .",
    "it has also been shown that the pair amplitude can be odd in frequency.@xcite odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing has been found in spin - singlet @xmath0-wave sf junctions due to spin - rotational symmetry breaking and it explains the long - range proximity effect in these junctions.@xcite very recently , the same magnetic field induced odd - frequency pairing has also been found in tis.@xcite in superconductor - normal metal ( sn ) junctions translational symmetry breaking instead generates odd - frequency spin - singlet odd - parity components @xcite .",
    "however , the odd - parity limits the odd - frequency pairing to ballistic junctions.@xcite    in this article we show with a simple analysis that the effective spin - orbit coupling @xmath4 on the ti surface immediately induces odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave correlations , even in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath0-wave nature of the odd - frequency component makes it robust against disorder , in sharp contrast to normal sn junctions .",
    "the odd - frequency correlations appear whenever there is an in - surface gradient in the proximity - induced spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairing , with the odd - frequency order parameter directly proportional to the in - surface gradient .",
    "we numerically calculate the odd - frequency response in several superconducting two - dimensional ( 2d ) ti systems , including sn , ss junctions , and in the presence of surface supercurrents .",
    "these results point to an important missing component in the discussion on the role of proximity induced superconductivity in tis and the odd - frequency component ought to be included in the study of low energy states and majorana fermions in tis .",
    "we also discuss experimental consequences of the odd - frequency pairing .",
    "we find that the analytic @xmath5 form of the odd - frequency response does not result in low energy states , which previously has been intimately linked to the appearance of odd - frequency components,@xcite but the predicted gapped spectrum could allow detection of the odd - frequency component with local tunneling probes .",
    "the spin - triplet pairing will further produce a finite knight shift in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) or muon spin - rotation measurements .",
    "we start with an analytic calculation that illustrates the appearance of an odd - frequency component .",
    "the hamiltonian that describes the contact between a ti and a conventional @xmath0-wave spin - singlet superconductor ( sc ) , see fig [ fig : sn](a ) , can be written as @xmath6 : @xmath7 @xmath8 is the hamiltonian describing the ti surface state at @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the hamiltonian for the sc electronic states at @xmath11 , and @xmath12 describes the tunneling between the sc and ti .",
    "we use the low energy approximation around the dirac point for the ti dispersion .",
    "@xmath10 is of the standard form , where we explicitly allow for position dependence through the site index @xmath13 , where then @xmath14 is the matrix in spin space , which we choose to be spin - singlet .",
    "we assume that the kinetic energy @xmath15 in the sc is a simple band and that the tunneling matrix element @xmath16 is nonzero only for neighboring sites at the ti - sc interface .",
    "we further assume that @xmath17 is dependent on the in - surface @xmath18-coordinate and approximate it by a linear slope @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unit cell size .",
    "superconducting correlations in the ti will be induced by pairs tunneling into the ti from the superconducting side .",
    "therefore , any induced pair amplitude in the ti will be proportional to @xmath17 and its derivatives at the interface . to derive the induced pair component on the ti surface",
    ", we evaluate the anomalous green s function @xmath21 . using standard methods",
    "we find it to be proportional to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the matsubara green s function for the electrons in the ti , @xmath24^{-1}$ ] is the anomalous green s function for a conventional superconductor , where we assume slow variations of @xmath25 . by going to momentum space and using the @xmath26-space expansion @xmath27 , we can rewrite the nontrivial part of the induced pair amplitude on the surface of the ti as @xmath28 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\sum_{{\\bf k } }   \\frac { |t|^2 \\omega_n \\hat{\\sigma }",

    "superconducting component.@xcite it is the characteristic spin - momentum locking in the dirac surface spectrum that induces spin - triplet odd - frequency pairing in the presence of translational symmetry breaking",
    ". the @xmath0-wave nature of this pairing guarantees robustness against disorder .",
    "the situation here is different from the normal metal case where only odd - frequency spin - singlet odd - parity correlations are induced by translational symmetry breaking.@xcite to evaluate the on - site odd - frequency component we will assume that @xmath29 of the conventional supercoductor is the dominant scale and we ignore higher order terms in @xmath30 .",
    "the local on - site amplitude on the ti surface is given by an integral over the momenta and is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath32 dependence has also been reported in heavy fermion compounds.@xcite the particular form of the gap function allows us to introduce an order parameter , i.e.  the inherent parameter that is constant at equal time in the odd - frequency superconductor , see e.g.  .",
    "the odd - frequency order parameter in our case is proportional to @xmath33 this proportionality to the in - plane gradient of the @xmath0-wave gap can be tested and we indeed find that @xmath34 is tracking the spatial gradient of the gap , see figs .",
    "[ fig : sn](f ) and [ fig : curr](b ) .",
    "one of the observable consequences of odd - frequency superconductivity is usually the appearance of sub - gap states,@xcite or even a low - energy continuum associated with a gapless nature of the state.@xcite however , we find here that the particular structure of the odd - frequency gap @xmath35 results in no intragap states at the lowest energies and thus this odd - frequency gap state is fully gapped . indeed , after analytic continuation from the matsubara axis , the local density of states ( ldos ) is proportional to @xmath36 \\sim { \\rm re}[1- c^2/e^2]^{-1}$ ] , which vanishes at energies below the minigap induced by the tunneling @xmath37 .",
    "one has to keep in mind that these features will occur in addition to the ldos features introduced by the induced conventional bcs pairing .",

    "we set the energy and length scales by fixing @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively and choose @xmath49 , which gives a bulk band gap of @xmath50 .",
    "the influence of the sc can be described by an effective on - site attractive potential @xmath51 acting at the ti edge when it is in proximity to a sc:@xcite @xmath52 we solve @xmath53 self - consistently for the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave mean - field order parameter @xmath54 .",

    "as required by the pauli principle , @xmath57 always vanishes for a self - consistent solution of @xmath58 , whereas the time derivative at equal times @xmath59 defines the odd - frequency order parameter , in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) . also , since @xmath60 commutes with @xmath61 , the @xmath62 spin - triplet projection @xmath63 is identically zero .",
    "we also define a time - dependent quantity for @xmath0-wave spin - singlet pairing : @xmath64 , which is related to the order parameter through @xmath65 .      from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ganom2 ] ) we know that non - zero odd - frequency spin - triplet correlations require a gradient in the superconducting order parameter along the ti edge , i.e.  @xmath66 needs to be finite .",
    "this is the case e.g.  at any step edge in a ti proximity coupled to a sc , but a more striking example is a sn junction along the ti edge , as schematically pictured in fig .",

    "@xmath73 ) the height is approximately constant , but the peak instead becomes broader , with the average width @xmath74 , defined as the ratio of the total weight of the peak to its height @xmath71 , increasing roughly linearly with @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn](e ) we also plot the height and width of the gradient of the spin - singlet response @xmath75 for a direct comparison . for large @xmath56",

    "[ fig : sn](f ) we finally compare the odd - frequency order parameter @xmath76 with @xmath66 . as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) , we find these two quantities to be directly proportional .",
    "the odd - frequency pairing in a sn ti junction is strikingly different from that of a conventional sn junction .",
    "the odd - frequency response in the ti case has even - parity spin - triplet symmetry , which is robust against impurity scattering and can thus survive even in the diffusive regime,@xcite in contrast to the odd - parity spin - singlet symmetry in a regular sn junction.@xcite related to this disorder robustness , we also find that @xmath70 is insensitive to any fermi level mismatch at the sn interface , created by using different chemical potentials in n and s. in a normal sn junction , the odd - frequency pairing quickly disappears when the transparency of the interface is reduced.@xcite finally , to investigate the influence of the odd - frequency pairing on the low - energy spectrum , we study ss junctions , where the two s regions have different pair potentials @xmath67 .",
    "we find no evidence for a reduced gap or intragap states in both sharp and extended interface junctions.@xcite this expands our analytical low - energy result to exclude any intragap states , and is again in sharp contrast to conventional sn and sf junctions.@xcite      odd - frequency correlations can also be generated in a homogenous ti - sc system if a supercurrent @xmath77 is applied in - surface , since the current is proportional to the gradient of the phase of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "we model such a system by setting @xmath78 , with @xmath26 being the ( fixed ) phase winding which is proportional to the current , and solve self - consistently for @xmath58 .",
    "we find that @xmath79 and @xmath80 , i.e.  both @xmath81 and @xmath70 have the same phase winding @xmath26 for all @xmath56 , but the amplitudes @xmath82 and phase off - sets @xmath83 are dependent on @xmath56 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : curr](a ) we plot the ( position - independent ) magnitudes of @xmath70 and @xmath75 as function of @xmath56 for two different values of @xmath26 . similar to the sn junction , @xmath70 increases rapidly for small @xmath56 . for small currents",
    "@xmath70 continues to increase even for large @xmath56 , even though less steeply .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath75 which , apart from small oscillations , decreases with increasing time . for larger currents we see a sharp downturn in @xmath70 at intermediate time values . before this downturn",
    "we find that @xmath70 is directly proportional to @xmath26 , as expected from its relation to @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ganom2 ] ) .",
    "however , for times past the downturn , @xmath70 instead decreases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "the phase off - set parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 also tracks each other ( with the expected @xmath86 shift ) before the downturn in @xmath70 , but past this time the correlation between them is lost .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath70 and @xmath75 are only tracking each other in a finite @xmath56-range , which set by the current . in fig .  [",

    "both the odd - frequency order parameter @xmath88 and @xmath66 are linear in @xmath26 , with their ratio being a constant for all currents .",
    "this shows that the odd - frequency order parameter is always directly proportional to the current ( phase winding ) , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : op ] ) , and thus applying a supercurrent offers an experimentally easy way to tune the strength of the odd - frequency pairing .",
    "so far we have only discussed @xmath89 spin - triplet pairing .",
    "equal spin - triplet pairing ( @xmath90 is produced at the ti edge if a term misaligned with the spin - quantization axis is present in the hamiltonian .",

    "@xmath95 is still in the non - trivial topological phase with a single dirac cone at the edge for @xmath96 .",

    "surprisingly , @xmath103 is not only non - zero at the sn interface , but in the whole s region , as shown in fig .  [",

    "in fact , we find that a non - zero @xmath103 is generated whenever @xmath104 is non - zero , i.e.  for a finite order parameter gradient perpendicular to the surface of the ti .",
    "since the low - energy density of states varies dramatically between the surface and the bulk of a ti , there will always be a strong such gradient for proximity - induced superconductivity in a ti . in the bulk of the s region @xmath105 , and thus the criterion for @xmath101 to be non - zero is the same as for @xmath97 , i.e.  a finite gradient in - surface gradient @xmath66 . in terms of the @xmath106-vector for the @xmath107 odd - frequency pairing , we find that it is always real , yielding a unitary spin - triplet state .",
    "in summary , we have shown that odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing is present in a ti proximity - coupled to a conventional @xmath0-wave spin - singlet superconductor in zero magnetic field .",
    "the time - independent order parameter for the odd - frequency pairing is proportional to the in - plane gradient of the induced @xmath0-wave gap .",
