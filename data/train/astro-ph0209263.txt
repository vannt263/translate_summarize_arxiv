    "rapid progress in the development of millimeter astronomical facilities , such as the increase of antennae sizes and/or of the number of array elements , or as the continuing improvement in the sensitivity of detectors , have now made it possible to explore the high redshift universe in this window and therefore to exploit the potentialities of gravitational lensing effects .",
    "why is it so important to explore this wavelength domain ?",
    "in one short statement : the presence of cold dust and of molecular material can be traced in this window and both components witness the formation of heavy elements .",
    "if they are detected in galaxies at high redshifts , they allow us to probe star formation in the early universe .",
    "they reveal as well processes related to the startup of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and signal the presence of massive black - holes .",
    "large amounts of molecular gas are encountered in the close environment of the central engine in agn .",
    "this material is often regarded as the fuel which allows to activate the agn .",
    "an evolutionary scenario would then connect ir - luminous galaxies rich in molecular material and with intense star formation to the formation / feeding of massive black holes .",
    "several fundamental questions are therefore underlying the search for dust and molecular gas at high redshift : the redshift of galaxy formation ?",
    "the chemical evolution of the universe with time ?",
    "the evolution of the dust content in the universe at early ages ?",
    "the epoch and the scenario of the formation of massive black holes ?",
    "the startup and evolution of agn activity ?",
    "do we have already some clues to answer these questions ?",
    "the most powerful agns , quasars , are now detected up to redshift around 6.5 , and galaxies up to redshift 6 .",
    "so we know that in this redshift range the universe already hosted galaxies and massive black holes and that its metal content was substantial since the spectra of high redshift agns are very similar to those of low redshift agns . yet",
    ", only a few objects are known at these high redshifts and this may provide a biased view .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to enlarge the sample and of course , the goal is also to push the redshift limit .    pushing the redshift limit also means that we are investigating sources with lower and lower flux density .",
    "this can be achieved through technical improvements , using larger collectors and better detectors .",
    "the alma project is showing the way .",
    "another manner is to take advantage of the effects induced by gravitational lensing ( for a review of its theoretical basis , see the comprehensive book by schneider et al .",
    "firstly , image magnification allows us to detect more distant sources of cold dust and molecular gas of a given intrinsic luminosity , or to detect at a given redshift sources of fainter intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the latter in particular is important for good determinations of luminosity functions .",
    "secondly , differential magnification effects can be used as an elegant tool to probe the size of molecular and dusty structures in the lensed source , as long as the lensing system provides the appropriate geometry . in this case",
    ", it is imperative to have an excellent model of the lensing system , as any structural information about the source itself for example is recovered by tracing the image back through the lensing system .",
    "both aspects will be discussed at length in this paper . in some cases",
    "molecular absorption lines allow us to obtain information about the lensing galaxy itself .",
    "apart from hydrogen and helium , carbon and oxygen are the heavy elements with highest abundance in the universe .",
    "therefore , the co molecule is the most suitable candidate for the detection of molecular gas in emission at high redshift .",
    "the co molecules can be detected directly through their thermal line emission in the source or as silhouetted absorbers along the line of sight to a background source .",
    "the latter may occur for example for the lensing galaxy .",
    "several other molecules have been detected at high redshift , hco@xmath3 , hcn , h@xmath4co ... , while dust is detected essentially through its thermal emission .",
    "we provide in sect .",
    "[ molemission ] an overview of the co line emission and of the high redshift co sources detected so far .",
    "the role played by gravitational lensing in studying co sources at high redshift is highlighted . in sect .",
    "[ molabs0 ] we review molecular absorption and the importance of such measurements to investigate the properties of the lensing galaxies . sect .",
    "[ dustcont ] introduces the dust continuum emission and the use of differential magnification effects which can be made to probe the dust content of the lensed objects .",
    "three cases particularly well studied are discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ casestudies ] . in sect .",
    "[ pks1830model ] existing lens models for pks1830 - 211 are reviewed and a new one introduced .",
    "finally , in sect .  [ futureprosp ] the future of this type of investigations is presented in the perspective of new instrumental developments in general and of alma in particular .",
    "the goal of this section is primarily to highlight the benefits of exploiting gravitational lensing effects in the millimeter range , that is in co line emission .",
    "therefore , after some brief comments on the pioneering observations of low redshift sources , we shall concentrate on the results obtained on high redshift sources .",
    "this section deals essentially with the co line emission , while the following sections will discuss molecular absorption lines and dust thermal emission .",
    "detection and measurements of the @xmath5co rotational transitions in galactic and extragalactic sources have had a great impact on the development of astrochemistry .",
    "the j=1 - 0 co transition is excited by collisions with h@xmath4 molecules , even in clouds at low kinetic temperature .",
    "the low - j transitions are in general optically thick , the opacity being determined observationally by the relative intensity of the corresponding @xmath6co transition . on the contrary ,",
    "the high - j transitions are optically thin .",
    "therefore , it is quite interesting to perform multi - transition studies to ascertain in a more secure fashion the physical conditions , temperature and density , in the emitting molecular material .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of very dense molecular material exposed to intense radiation fields , like in the environment of an agn or in powerful star forming regions .",
    "the conversion factor which is used to derive the total mass of molecular material from the observed l@xmath7 , is also highly dependent on the physical conditions in the molecular material .",
    "it has been determined to be 4.6 m@xmath8 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath10)@xmath9 in standard milky way clouds @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that lower values of the conversion factor ( by up to a factor 10 ) should be used in the case of dense and warm material as usually encountered in a molecular torus around an agn @xcite .",
    "following far - infrared ( fir ) observations by iras , an important population of ir - luminous ( dust - rich ) galaxies was found .",
    "this was the starting point for investigating as well their molecular content , using the millimeter facilities available in the late 80 s .",
    "a number of ir - luminous galaxies and agns were detected , mostly in the co(1 - 0 ) transition and the field develop quickly .",
    "regarding low redshift sources , let us briefly mention the detection of agns such as mrk 231 @xcite , mrk 1014 @xcite , i zw 1 @xcite and of some low redshift quasars @xcite @xcite or radio galaxies @xcite @xcite @xcite . at moderate redshift , co was detected in the radio galaxy 3c48 ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "this search is continuing through e.g. the caltech co high and low redshift radio galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "on the side of co sources at high redshift ( z@xmath122 ) , the first object detected was iras 10214 + 4724 @xcite @xcite .",
    "all along the 90 s , millimeter dishes and interferometer arrays in service were pushed to their limits in searching for other candidates , selected for example upon the strength of their submillimeter flux .",
    "a large amount of observing time was dedicated to such programs at the ovro , bima , nobeyama and iram facilities . at face value",
    ", the success rate in detecting high redshift co sources has been modest .",
    "one reason for this is the uncertainty in the precise redshift of the emitting molecular gas under search , while the backends of the instruments are narrow in comparison to the redshift range to be explored .",
    "another reason is of course the limited sensitivity of existing instruments . only the most luminous and most gas - rich systems can be detected",
    "the situation should improve with new facilities such as alma ( see sect .",
    "[ future ] ) .",
    "sources detected so far are detailed below , in order of increasing redshift .",

    "the magnification factor is found to be around 10 for the co source which has an intrinsic radius of 400 pc .",
    "conversely , the far - ir emission detected in this object is magnified 13 times and arises from a source with radius 250 pc , while the mid - ir is magnified 50 times and arises from a source with radius 40 pc . after correcting for magnification , and using a conversion factor",

    "as noted above however , such a value for the conversion factor , obtained from co(1 - 0 ) observations of galactic molecular clouds , might not be applicable in the case of warmer and denser molecular material . a value for the conversion factor which is 5 times lower than the standard has been found in a study of extreme starbursts in ir - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , the mass value quoted above should regarded as an upper limit to the mass of the molecular gas in iras 10214 + 472 .",
    "still pending is the question of the co line emission share between a hidden agn and a starburst in the 400 pc region surrounding the agn .",
    "we notice also that the large extension ( 3 to 12 kpc ) in co emission reported by @xcite has not been confirmed by the iram interferometer data @xcite .",
    "one interesting case is that of the radio galaxy 53w002 at @xmath17 , located at the center of a group of @xmath1820 lyman-@xmath19 emitters .",

    "it is found that the 8.4 ghz and co source are coincident , at a location consistent with that of the optical / uv continuum source .",
    "the most likely origin of the molecular emission is therefore from the close environment of the agn .",

    "on the other hand , optical data shows clearly than it hosts as well a dust - enshrouded agn @xcite .",
    "a precise share of co emission between the two components remains to be investigated .",
    "in the course of a systematic co emission survey of gravitationally lensed sources with the iram interferometer @xcite , the source mg 0751 + 2716 has been detected in the co(4 - 3 ) transition at @xmath36 .",
    "this source was first discovered to be a gravitationally lensed quasar , from vla maps @xcite .",

    "therefore , the amplification factor is not known .",
    "however , given the observed strength of the co line emission it should be large .",

    "remarkably , the co line emission extends over 30 kpc and breaks into two components : one corresponding to the agn ( radio core ) and a second one which is rather related to a major episode of star formation .",
    "this state of merging is speculatively interpreted as the formative stage of an elliptical host around the residing agn .",
    "again , the molecular mass is found to be quite large , around @xmath41 m@xmath8 .",

    "the co line ratio points towards warm and dense molecular gas .",
    "thermal emission from the dust component is also measured .",
    "both the molecular and dust luminosities appear to be very high .",

    "the molecular / dusty component is in the form of a nuclear disk with radius 90 - 270 pc orbiting the central engine of the bal quasar .",
    "this source looks therefore quite similar to the cloverleaf .",
    "recently , however , extended low - excitation co emission ( the j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 transitions ) have been detected using the vla @xcite .",

    "finally , let s discuss the four sources detected so far at z larger than 4 :    * pss2322 + 1944 *   the radio quiet quasar pss2322 + 1944 has recently been detected in the co(5 - 4 ) and co(4 - 3 ) transitions at a redshift of @xmath45 with the iram interferometer @xcite .",

    "the source does not exhibit a noticeable extension neither in the 1.35 mm continuum nor in the co line emission .",
    "in addition , there is no obvious sign of gravitational lensing on the line - of - sight to this source .",
    "the authors have derived a very large mass of molecular gas , close to 10@xmath55 m@xmath8 .",

    "it is uncertain whether this object is gravitationally lensed or not .",
    "is the north - west source a second image of the quasar ?",
    "there are hints that this might be the case as a strong gravitational shear has been measured in the field ( fort and dodorico , private communication ) .",

    "a summary of the sources properties is provided in table  [ cotable ] .",
    "this quick compilation of high redshift co sources has prompted a number of key - issues :    _ ( i ) _   a major difficulty in detecting high redshift co sources is the lack of precision in our guess for the redshift of the molecular gas .",
    "the instantaneous frequency coverage of current backends requires that the redshift is known a - priori with a precision of a few percent . why is this condition hard to fulfill ?",
    "the molecular gas emission in distant objects can arise from the close environment of an agn .",
    "yet , published redshifts for distant agn are mostly measured from emission lines of highly ionized species which can be strongly affected by winds",
    ". indeed velocity offsets of up to 2500 km s@xmath9 have been observed between the co lines and the blue - shifted civ line for example ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hopefully , this limitation will be overcome with the next generation of backends .    _",
    "( ii ) _  an uncertain part in the interpretation of the observed co line intensities lies with the physical state of the molecular gas and the conversion factor l@xmath14 to m(h@xmath4 ) to be applied in the case of high redshift sources .",
    "when several co transitions are observed ( such as for iras10214 + 4724 , h1413 + 117 , apm08279 + 5255 and br1202 - 0725 ) , the physical conditions of the molecular gas can be analyzed , pointing towards warm ( t@xmath18100 k ) , dense ( a few 10@xmath28 @xmath62 ) and moderately optically thick material .",
    "such conditions could very well characterize molecular gas in the proximity of an agn .",
    "conversely , the conditions of the molecular gas in an extended starburst may be more similar to those encountered in galactic molecular clouds .",

    "( iii ) _  finally , the outmost efforts should be made to find out whether a source is gravitationally lensed or not , before the claim for the presence of a huge amount of molecular gas ( 10@xmath55 m@xmath8 ) can be taken as a starting point for modeling .",

    "strong shear ( possibly combined with weak shear ) , induces magnification factors of up to 30 !",
    "this would decrease by one order of magnitude the mass of molecular gas derived .",
    "if , at the same time , the applicable conversion factor is on the low side of its possible values range , a reduction of the actual molecular gas mass by another order of magnitude would apply .    in conclusion",
    ", it is important to search for other high redshift co sources and , at the same time , to investigate carefully the nature of their environment / line - of - sight and the physical conditions in their molecular gas .",
    "another method to study molecular gas at high redshift is to observe molecular rotational lines in absorption rather than emission .",
    "whereas emission is biased in favor of warm and dense molecular gas , tracing regions of active high mass star formation , molecular absorption lines trace excitationally cold gas .",
    "this is important since a large part of the molecular gas mass may reside in regions far away from massive star formation and therefore remain largely unobserved in emission .",

    "when interpreting the time delay in terms of a hubble constant , the largest systematic error comes from modeling of the gravitational potential ( see chapter x ) .",

    "the study of gas and dust at high redshift is important for several reasons .",
    "it gives us an unbiased view of star formation activity in obscured objects and it tells the story of the chemical evolution and star formation history in galaxies through the amount of processed gas ( and dust ) it contains . with today",
    "s millimeter and submillimeter facilities , this research area has used gravitational lensing mostly as a tool to boost the sensitivity .",
    "this is evident through the preponderance of gravitationally lensed objects among those which have been detected at @xmath373 in the lines of the co molecule .",
    "it is also evident in the use of lensing magnification by galaxy clusters in order to reach faint submm / mm continuum sources .",
    "there are , however , a few cases where millimeter lines have been directly involved in understanding lensing configurations .",
    "the best example of this is the highly obscured pks1830 - 211 , where the lens was identified through molecular absorption lines and where these lines give a velocity dispersion measure by originating in two different regions of the lens .",
    "the molecular absorption lines in this system have also been used to derive the differential time delay between the two main components , the main objective being to determine the hubble constant , but also adding to the constraints in modeling this particular lens system .    with future millimeter and submillimeter instruments , such as alma , coming on - line ,",
    "the situation is likely to change drastically",
    ". the sensitivity of alma will be such that it does not need the extra magnification from lensing to observe very distant objects .",
    "instead it will be used to study the lensing itself . the more or less constant sensitivity to dust emission over a redshift range stretching from @xmath374 to @xmath360",

    "alma will therefore discover many more lenses and allow a direct assessment of cosmological parameters through lens statistics .",
    "weak lensing will also be an area where alma can successfully contribute .",
    "again , the high sensitivity to dust emission out to very high redshifts , combined with an angular resolution @xmath375 , and a more beneficial ` psf ' will make alma more efficient for probing the potential of galaxy clusters than present day optical / ir telescopes .",
