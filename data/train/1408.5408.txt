    "the electromagnetic excitations and ensuing dynamics of nanoparticles , molecules and atoms in the presence of an electric field has been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the particles may initially be unpolarized , but due to the external field and their mutual interaction they may acquire induced dipole and higher electric moments . as a",
    "consequence electric forces and torques are produced , resulting in particle motion and the formation of equilibrium configurations .",
    "an important case is optical trapping and binding , which , if many particles are involved may lead to self - assembly of ordered structures @xcite .",
    "structures are also formed in electro - rheological fluids , where a static or slowly varying field induces the formation of linear arrays and columns in a medium containing polarizable spheres in suspension @xcite .",
    "examples where an understanding of forces and torques is also crucial are the dielectrophoresis and electrorotation effects , related to motion in a non uniform field @xcite and a rotating ac field @xcite , respectively .",
    "other applications include the control of agglomeration , and the separation of proteins or living cells in suspension @xcite .",
    "nanorotors driven by a light force have also been studied @xcite .",
    "several methods have been used to obtain forces @xcite and torques @xcite in the past , some involving the use of an interaction potential energy whose gradient is taken to obtain the force @xcite . in this work",
    "we prove that if the particles are absorptive the system is non - conservative and the net force experienced by each member of the ensemble may not be derived from an interaction potential .",
    "in fact , we show explicitly that structure in the interaction energy arising from absorption resonances in a pair of gold nanospheres exhibits energy minima leading to unphysical equilibrium configurations that are not present if the force is calculated directly from coulomb s law @xcite . away from such resonances when absorption is negligible either method may be used leading to similar results .    in order to obtain explicit expressions for the force and torque we asume the particles to be spherical , thus allowing a multipolar analysis and a comparison with results obtained in the dipole approximation . for an ac external excitation",
    "we find the dipole approximation to give accurate results if the center to center separation between neighbors is not smaller than three particle radii , while at closer interparticle distance the inclusion of all multipoles gives rise to several resonances in the force and torque strength , shifted to lower frequencies owing to particle - particle couplings .",
    "this is in accordance with previous results on the electric excitation of dielectric particles arrays showing a similar distance dependent behavior @xcite .",
    "location of such resonances in the frequency spectrum may be useful in applications when the force or torque strength becomes important . within the same model we find that the appearance of a torque causing particle rotation requires that the particle be dissipative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : inter ] we present compact expressions for the time - averaged force and torque acting over a particle in an arbitrary array of nanoparticles in a uniform ac electric field .",
    "the very structure of the resulting expressions reveals the need for dissipation in order for a torque to arise .",
    "the cases of linear and circular polarization are discussed . in order to assess the relevance of higher multipoles in both forces and torque , in sec .",
    "[ sec : special ] we apply our model to two gold nanospheres in an electric field parallel or perpendicular to the interparticle axis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discus ] we prove that the presence of dissipation makes the system non conservative , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we present our conclusions . finally , two appendices are added to provide details of the calculations .",
    "we consider a system of nanoparticles embedded in a non absorptive dielectric medium , excited by an external ac electric field of angular frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the particles are uncharged and their material response to a local electric field may in general be characterized by a complex response function @xmath1 .",
    "the external field induces a dipole moment on each particle , which in turn excites multipoles on every other member of the ensemble owing to the non uniformity of the electric field it produces at each particle site . for simplicity we shall assume in what follows that the particles are of spherical shape .    as known , for a dilute system with average center - to - center separation of the order of three times the particle radii or more , the accuracy of the dipole approximation is acceptable and the effect of higher multipoles",
    "may be neglected @xcite . in such case and",
    "if only two particles are present , the electric force between them may be simply obtained by direct application of the discrete form of coulombs law , as described in reference @xcite .",
    "when separations less than three particle radii become involved however , the effect of higher multipoles must be included @xcite .",
    "the general form of coulomb s law to be used is then ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the time - averaged force on particle @xmath4 , @xmath5 is its charge density and @xmath6 is the local electric field due to the external sources and other particles in the ensemble .",
    "a rather lengthy calculation then yields the force cartesian components ( see appendix a ) ,    @xmath7    where the pole order index @xmath8 here and in what follows covers the range of integers @xmath9 . in the above expressions the coefficient    @xmath10    weights the strength with which the multipole of order @xmath8 contributes , with @xmath11 the corresponding particle polarizability , a complex quantity if absorption is present .",
    "also    @xmath12    is the induced multipole of indices @xmath13 on particle @xmath4 . and    @xmath14    @xmath15 is the usual complex spherical harmonic function .",
    "methods to obtain the multipoles @xmath16 for arbitrary configurations are described in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "notice that since the force involves products of multipoles of different order , if there is a single spherical particle and the external field is uniform only the dipole moment is excited and the force is zero .",
    "spinning of coupled particles in an external field has been observed in the past @xcite . in order to capture this effect we consider next the time - averaged torque on sphere i due to the local field , as given by    @xmath17    where the origin is taken at the particle center .",
    "work similar to that done above for the forces ( see appendix b ) leads to the time - averaged torque cartesian components    @xmath18    where the coefficients",
    "@xmath19    are complex if @xmath11 is , and    @xmath20    it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : taux1 ] ) to ( [ eq : defs ] ) that if the system has no dissipation , i.e. if @xmath21 is real , the torque is zero .",
    "we conclude that in general a torque arises in such systems from dissipative electromagnetic interactions .",
    "even if there is dissipation however , the torque may be suppressed by special symmetries .",
    "such is the case for a linear array subject to a uniform electric field parallel to the line joining their centers . by choosing the @xmath22-axis to be aligned with this line , only modes with @xmath23",
    "are excited leading to zero torque , as may be easily verified from the structure of the above equations .",
    "a similar situation occurs if the applied electric field lies on the @xmath24 plane since in this case only modes with @xmath25 are excited symmetrically and the torque is again zero .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that if the linear array is under a uniform electric field with components along the @xmath22-axis and the @xmath24 plane , modes with @xmath25 and @xmath23 become excited .",
    "so , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : taux1 ] ) to ( [ eq : tauz1 ] ) a torque is produced provided that electromagnetic dissipation is not negligible .",

    "the physical origin of such a torque is conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the rotating field carries angular momentum , which is transferred to the particles when absorption takes place causing them to experience a spinning torque .",
    "also , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite when a linearly polarized field is not aligned with a symmetry axis of a linear array such as a pair , the local field at each particle site has a rotating component , and the same argument applies .",
    "we shall apply our general results to the simplest case , that of two identical spheres of radii @xmath34 subject to a uniform oscillating electric field , both parallel and perpendicular to a line joining the spheres centers , that we choose to be the @xmath22 axis .",

    "the separation is @xmath52 and we have included multipoles up to order @xmath53 in the computation , following the convergence criterion given in ref .",
    "the force acting on the particle at the origin is attractive ( positive ) in the parallel configuration and repulsive ( negative ) in the perpendicular geometry , as expected .",
    "three multipolar resonances are clearly resolved at this separation , with force peaks greatly enhanced , about three orders of magnitude above the background value . as the separation between the particles",
    "is increased the resonances move to higher frequencies , decrease in size and fewer of them become resolved @xcite . at a center to center separation of about three particle radii and larger ,",
    "only one resonance is seen .",
    "this dipolar peak , at separation @xmath54 and parallel excitation , has been included in the figure for comparison with an amplification factor of one thousand ( dash - dotted curve ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the @xmath22 component of the average torque acting on each nanoparticle as given by eq .",

    "separations are @xmath52 ( solid curve ) and @xmath54 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the pair is subject to an electric field whose direction rotates in the plane @xmath24 . as for the force , several resonances are resolved at small separation , while beyond about separation @xmath55 only one peak is observed .",
    "it can be seen that as the spheres become closer other resonances occur at frequencies below the single sphere dipole resonance value @xmath56 .",
    "these additional resonance frequencies correspond to resonant modes associated with the multipole moments @xmath16 .",
    "the existence of dissipation makes a system non conservative . to see this ,",
    "recall that for ideal electromagnetic arrays where dissipation is absent , the force acting on a particle may be obtained as the gradient with respect to the particle coordinates of the configuration energy @xmath57 . if the particle makes a virtual displacement @xmath58 the corresponding electric force it is subject to is @xmath59 , an expression obtained by the energy balance equation ,    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the energy supplied by the sources to maintain the potentials of the electrodes fixed , and @xmath62 is the variation in the energy stored in the field .",
    "it can be shown that for this case @xmath63 so that the expression @xmath64 is obtained @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for real systems dissipation effects must be taken into account and that is done adding a term @xmath65 in the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw1 ] ) .",
    "this term depends on the path followed during the virtual displacement since the polarization in the particle does and the energy loss is determined by its imaginary part . if the particle is brought from point @xmath66 to point @xmath67 , to the mechanical work done one must add the energy loss term @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the time averaged power absorbed by the system and @xmath70 the time taken during the displacement .",
    "both the integrand and the upper limit of this integral depend on the path making the mechanical system non conservative .    based on the above argument we state that in a dissipative system it is incorrect to obtain the force as the gradient of a potential . to illustrate the difference between a direct application of coulomb s law and the use of a potential we consider two polarizable spheres of radius @xmath34 , a distance @xmath41 apart in an electric field of frequency @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath71 which for simplicity we choose to be parallel to the line joining the centers . in the dipole approximation",

    "@xmath81    the two forms ( [ eq : felew ] ) and ( [ eq : felec ] ) agree only when the dielectric function is real , and dissipation is absent . in figure 3",
    "we compare the force obtained using these two expressions for a pair of gold nanospheres with a dielectric function as described en sec .",
    "iii . as can be observed while the direct coulomb s method gives an attractive force at all frequencies , the model based on the gradient of the interaction energy presents two peaks and an unphysical change of sign in the force .",
    "we have shown that in an ensemble of polarizable spheres in an oscillating electric field , the presence of a rotation torque requires the particle material to be dissipative .",
    "we also show that energy loss due to dissipation makes the system non conservative so that it is improper to use an interaction energy to derive the force , an approach that has been employed erroneously in the past @xcite .",

    "<S> several peaks are found in the force and torque between two spheres at small interparticle distances , which coalesce to just one as the separation grows beyond three particle radii . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that in the presence of dissipation the force on each particle is non conservative and may not be derived from the classical interaction potential energy as has been done in the past . </S>"
