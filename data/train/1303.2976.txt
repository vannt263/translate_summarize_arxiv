    "heavy quarks play important roles in probing properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "a single heavy quark in the qgp interacts with the medium particles and eventually it will be kinetically thermalized as is described by the langevin equation @xcite : @xmath0 if one can observe the degree of thermalization in a given time scale , one can derive the drag force of the heavy quark . when put in the qgp",
    ", a quarkonium , which is a bound state of a heavy quark - antiquark pair , gets unstable at sufficiently high temperature because the plasma constituents screen the color charges and turn the confining potential into the debye screened potential @xcite : @xmath1 the debye screening in the qgp and the related issues are still under active theoretical and conceptual developments @xcite .",
    "if one can observe the  melting \" of quarkonium , one can infer the temperature provided that there is a reliable theory for the melting .",
    "these heavy quark probes are fundamentally different from each other : the drag force is a classical description for the non - potential irreversible force while the melting is a quantum phenomenon of bound - states in the screened potential .",
    "moreover it is natural to expect that each heavy quark in a quarkonium experiences the irreversible drag process . in a theoretical point of view , it is desirable to have a unified quantum description for both of them , whose classical limit yields the langevin dynamics in the single heavy quark case . in other words , we pursue the unified quantum description for in - medium forces in the qgp . the theoretical framework needed for this purpose",
    "is that of open quantum systems .",
    "the basics of the open quantum systems @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
