    "studies on the structure of stochastic processes through the space of martingales associated with them date back to the 1960s .",
    "as seen from meyer s decomposition theorem for example , martingales are one of the suitable concepts for understanding the randomness of stochastic processes . in the framework of general markov processes , motoo and watanabe",
    "@xcite proved that , for a class @xmath2 of martingale additive functionals , there exists a kind of basis @xmath3 of @xmath2 such that every element in @xmath2 can be represented as a sum of stochastic integrals based on @xmath3 and a purely discontinuous part .",
    "this is a generalization of the study by ventcel  @xcite , wherein the brownian motion on @xmath4 was considered .",
    "we term the cardinality of the basis as the martingale dimension .",
    "( the precise definition is discussed in section  2 . )",
    "related general theories are found in some articles such as those by kunita and watanabe  @xcite and cramr  @xcite .",
    "later , davis and varaiya  @xcite introduced the concept of multiplicity of filtration on filtered probability spaces as an abstract generalization .",
    "a vast amount of literature is now available on the study of filtrations from various directions by m.  yor , m.  mery , m.  t.  barlow , e.  a.  perkins , b.  tsirelson , and many others . in this article , we focus on the quantitative estimate of martingale dimensions associated with symmetric diffusion processes on state spaces that do not necessarily have smooth structures , in particular , on self - similar fractals .    the martingale dimension of typical examples , such as the brownian motion on a @xmath5-dimensional complete riemannian manifold , is @xmath5 .",
    "this number can be informally interpreted as the number of `` independent noises '' included in the process .",
    "when the underlying space does not have a differential structure , it is not easy to determine or even to provide estimates of the martingale dimension .",
    "the first result in this direction is due to kusuoka  @xcite , who considered the martingale dimension @xmath0 with respect to additive functionals ( af - martingale dimension ) and proved that @xmath1 for the brownian motion on the @xmath5-dimensional standard sierpinski gasket sg@xmath6 ( see fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ) for every @xmath5 .    , sg@xmath7 , and some other p.c.f .",

    "self - similar sets , title=\"fig : \" ] , sg@xmath7 , and some other p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets , title=\"fig : \" ]    this was an unexpected result because the hausdorff dimension of sg@xmath6 is @xmath8 , which is arbitrarily large when @xmath5 becomes larger .",
    "this result was generalized in @xcite to natural self - similar symmetric diffusion processes on post - critically finite ( p.c.f . )",
    "self - similar sets ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) satisfying certain technical conditions , with the same conclusion .",
    "the proofs heavily rely on the facts that the fractal sets under consideration are finitely ramified ( that is , they can be disconnected by removing finitely many points ) and that the dirichlet form associated with the diffusion is described by infinite random products of a finite number of matrices .",
    "no further results have yet been obtained in this direction .",
    "thus , the following questions naturally arise :    * what about the martingale dimensions of infinitely ramified fractals such assierpinski carpets ? * in general , are there any relations between @xmath0 and other kinds of dimensions ?    in this paper , we provide partial answers to these questions ; we prove that the af - martingale dimension @xmath0 of the brownian motion on ( generalized ) sierpinski carpets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) are dominated by the spectral dimension @xmath9",
    ".         in particular , if the process is point recurrent ( that is , if @xmath10 ) , then @xmath1 .",
    "this is the first time that nontrivial estimates of martingale dimensions for infinitely ramified fractals have been obtained .",
    "the proof is based on the analytic characterization of @xmath0 in terms of the index of the associated dirichlet form that was developed in @xcite , and new arguments for the estimate of the index in general frameworks , in which some harmonic maps play the crucial roles .",
    "this method is also applicable to p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets , which enables us to remove the technical assumptions in @xcite and conclude that @xmath1 . in @xcite , we had to exclude hata s tree - like set ( the rightmost figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) because of some technical restrictions such as the condition that every `` boundary point '' had to be a fixed point of one of the maps defining the self - similar set ; this example was discussed individually in @xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients of the proof is the construction of a special harmonic map from the fractal to the euclidean space  @xmath4 , which makes it possible to use certain properties of the classical energy form on @xmath4 . for this purpose ,",
    "we use a method analogous to the blowup argument in geometric measure theory .",
    "although we presently require the self - similar structure of the state space for this argument , we expect the relation @xmath11 to be true for more general metric measure spaces as well .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we review the concepts of the index of strong local regular dirichlet forms and the af - martingale dimension @xmath0 of the associated diffusion processes under a general setting . in section  3 , we develop some tools for the estimation of @xmath0 in the general framework . in section  4.1 , we discuss self - similar dirichlet forms on self - similar fractals and study some properties on the energy measures as a preparation for the proof of the main results . in section  4.2 ,",
    "we treat p.c.f .",
    "self - similar sets and prove that @xmath1 with respect to natural self - similar diffusions .",
