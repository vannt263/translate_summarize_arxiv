    "deep inelastic muon scattering . ]    figure  [ fig1]a shows the leading order feynman diagram for deep inelastic scattering and defines the kinematic variables .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b shows the 3-momentum vectors of the beam muon , scattered muon , and a typical hadron ; the standard variables are also defined . in addition",
    ", we define the quantity _ order _ for each hadron such that the hadron with the highest @xmath2 is order 1 , the hadron with the second highest @xmath2 is order 2 and so forth .",
    "the data presented in this talk were taken during the 1987 fixed target run at fermilab by the e665 collaboration using a 490  gev muon beam and a deuterium target .",
    "the most important cuts were @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "electromagnetic bremsstrahlung events , characterized by low neutral multiplicity , and large neutral energy , were removed using an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "charged hadrons were examined which had @xmath6 and @xmath7 . roughly @xmath8 events and @xmath9 hadrons survived these cuts . for further details on the event sample and the analysis ,",
    "see reference  @xcite .    in the quark - parton model , an azimuthal asymmetry can arise due to primordial @xmath0 of the struck parton  @xcite or to @xmath1 effects ( gluon bremsstrahlung and photon - gluon fusion )  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the primordial @xmath0 distribution is independent of @xmath10 , the theory predicts that the @xmath11 asymmetry , dominated by the @xmath0 , should disappear at large @xmath10 , going as @xmath12 .",
    "it is possible , however , that the effective value of @xmath0 depends upon @xmath10 and @xmath13 ( see , for instance , reference  @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical parton - level @xmath11 asymmetry was incorporated into a monte carlo  @xcite which was a modified version of lepto 5.2 ( matrix element ) with @xmath14 independent of @xmath10 .",
    "this monte carlo included a full simulation of the apparatus and used the same event reconstruction code that was used on data .",
    "therefore , the monte carlo results should be compared to the uncorrected data .",
    "in order to characterize the @xmath11 asymmetry in the data , we fit @xmath15 distributions to the form @xmath16 and plot the quantity @xmath17 as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath18 , or @xmath10 for hadrons of various orders .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig2]a  c ; the curves represent the monte carlo predictions . since the effective @xmath0 may depend on @xmath10 and since the @xmath0 contributes to hadron @xmath18 primarily at high @xmath2 , it is interesting to compare the hadron @xmath19 distributions in the high @xmath2 region from events with `` low @xmath10 '' @xmath20 to those with `` high q '' @xmath21",
    ". figure 2d shows @xmath19 versus @xmath2 for order 1 charged particles for both the low and the high @xmath10 regions .",
    "the curves indicate the monte carlo predictions .",
    "the shaded region at the bottom of the plot indicates an estimate of the @xmath19 resolution and also the level of the systematic error on @xmath19 .",
    "the data show several effects that are not well described by the monte carlo , which uses the standard value @xmath14 , independent of @xmath10 .",
    "first , the @xmath11 asymmetry in the data is mostly due to the order 1 particle and depends on @xmath18 of the order 1 hadron .",
    "second , there is more @xmath11 asymmetry and more @xmath18 in the data than in the monte carlo , possibly indicating that the overall @xmath22 is larger than @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the @xmath11 asymmetry in the data is independent of @xmath10 , persisting to higher values of @xmath10 than expected , and there is more @xmath18 at high @xmath10 than at low @xmath10 in the data , especially for the high @xmath2 particles . these @xmath10 dependences may be evidence that the effective @xmath22 depends on @xmath10 .",
    "it is also possible , of course , that our string model of hadronization or our treatment of the @xmath0 in the parton model is incorrect .",
    "the data are shown overlaid with monte carlo curves .",

    "a ) , note that the order 2 particles are restricted kinematically to the range @xmath24 , and practically to the range @xmath25 .",
