    "since we assumed that the co gas traces the dust in the radial direction , the size discrepancy would remain : these dust - based density profiles do not have enough material to be able to excite co emission lines at large disk radii ( see figure [ structures ] ) .",
    "to summarize , the fundamental conclusion from the radiative transfer modeling analysis of the sma data is that the spatial distributions of the co and millimeter - sized dust in the tw hya disk are different : the dust is systematically inferred to be more compact than the co gas .",
    "we used the sma to observe the 870@xmath1 m continuum and co @xmath2=3@xmath32 line emission from the disk around the nearby young star tw hya .",
    "these data represent the most sensitive high spatial resolution ( down to scales of 16au ) probes of the millimeter - wave dust and molecular gas content in any circumstellar disk to date . along with the sed",
    ", these observations were used in concert with continuum and line radiative transfer calculations in an effort to extract the disk density structure .",
    "we were unable to identify a consistent model structure that simultaneously accounts for the observed radial distributions of co and dust . assuming a radially constant grain size distribution and ( vertically integrated ) gas - to - dust mass ratio , the millimeter - sized dust structure is significantly more compact than the co. the resolved continuum emission profile demonstrates that the radial distribution of the millimeter - sized solids in the tw hya disk has a relatively sharp outer edge near 60au , which is considerably smaller than the observed extent of the co emission ( out to at least 215au ) .",
    "the tw hya disk structure has been studied extensively with millimeter - wave observations at lower angular resolution . in a series of investigations focused almost exclusively on spectral line emission , @xcite and @xcite relied on a slightly modified version of the physical structure model that was developed by @xcite to match the tw hya sed .",
    "while that model has been used quite successfully to explain the molecular gas structure , there has always been some tension between observations and its predicted millimeter / radio continuum emission profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the modest quality of the previous continuum data and the fact that this structure model was not designed ( or fitted ) with access to resolved observations of any kind , the disagreement was understandably dismissed . as might be expected from its assumption of a  steady \" accretion disk structure ( i.e. , with a large , positive surface density gradient ) , the @xcite model exhibits the same type of behavior as models sa / b or pa / b : it agrees with the data on large scales ( @xmath21100k@xmath35 ) , but significantly over - predicts the amount of emission on smaller scales .",
    "the same is true for the parametric similarity solution models ( where @xmath141 ) explored by @xcite , and would certainly apply to the analogous models developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of this previous modeling work admirably reproduces the extended molecular line emission that is observed , and in many cases the sed and millimeter - wave continuum emission on large angular scales as well .",
    "it is only with the sensitive , high angular resolution data presented here that we recognize a problem : the radial distribution of the millimeter - sized dust grains is much more compact than for the co.    unlike the thermal radiation at millimeter wavelengths , the optical and near - infrared light that scatters off small ( @xmath1421@xmath1 m ) grains in the tw hya disk surface is detected out to large distances from the central star  at least @xmath54 , comparable to what is inferred from co spectral images @xcite .",
    "so _ some _ dust traces the molecular gas , even if it is only a limited mass of small grains up in the disk atmosphere",
    ". however , these exquisitely detailed scattered light images exhibit subtle structural complexities .",
    "@xcite identified four distinct radial zones in the optical scattered light disk , with a prominent steepening of the brightness distribution just outside a radius of 50au ( @xmath51 ; their zone 1/2 boundary ) .",
    "similar infrared behavior is noted in the studies by @xcite and @xcite , which both suggested a break in the emission profile in the 50 - 80au ( @xmath51.0 - 1.5 ) range .",
    "those results were confirmed in a comprehensive analysis of new data by @xcite , who also called attention to a color change at a similar radius as well as an azimuthal asymmetry out to a slightly larger distance from the star ( @xmath5135au ) .",
    "the physical origin of these scattered light features has been a mystery , although speculation centered around variations in the dust height ( shadowing ) and gradients in the dust scattering properties ( either mineralogical or size - related ) .",
    "but in light of our discovery of an abrupt drop in the millimeter - wave continuum emission at the same location as these features , it is only natural to suspect that a more fundamental change occurs in the physical structure of the tw hya dust disk near 60au .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward explanation of the apparent co - dust size discrepancy inferred from the sma data is that we have used an incomplete description of the disk structure . as an example , consider a modification of either model type that incorporates an abrupt decrease in the surface densities ( or millimeter - wave dust opacities )  not the dust - to - gas ratio ",
    "outside @xmath143au .",
    "if that drop in @xmath144 ( or @xmath145 ) was not too large ( perhaps a factor of @xmath5100 ) , there would still be enough disk material to produce bright emission from the optically thick co lines and scattered light while also accounting for the sharp edge feature noted in the optically thin 870@xmath1 m emission profile .",
    "that  substructure \" in the outer dust disk might actually enhance the local gas - phase co abundance , as ultraviolet radiation can penetrate deeper into the disk interior and photodesorb co from the ( small ) reservoir of cold dust grains that remains at large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    nevertheless , a physical origin for such a dramatic drop in the dust densities and/or the millimeter - wave dust opacities is not obvious .",
    "one possibility is that the disk has been perturbed by a long - period ( as yet unseen ) companion .",
    "if a faint object is embedded in the disk near the apparent edge of the 870@xmath1 m emission distribution , it might open a gap that splits the disk into two distinct reservoirs and generate the warp asymmetry suggested by @xcite .",
    "but , a narrow gap alone would not account for the sma continuum observations .",
    "the millimeter - wave luminosity exterior to the gap would still need to be decreased , perhaps because the particles at those larger radii were preferentially unable to grow to millimeter sizes .",
    "@xcite quote deep limits on @xmath146-band point sources in the tw hya disk that suggest there are no companions more massive than @xmath56m@xmath147 near 60au , according to the @xcite models ( the corresponding mass limit is higher for the models of * ? ? ?",
    "certainly this kind of truncation or other forms of substructure could be invoked to explain the sharp radial edge in the sma dust observations .",
    "but rather than engage in further speculation on the details , it should suffice to point out that the potential for substructure or other anomalies in the tw hya disk can be tested with a substantial increase in resolution and sensitivity .",
    "moreover , spectral imaging of optically thinner gas tracers ( e.g. , the co isotopologues ) would make for an ideal test of the origins of the apparent co - dust size discrepancy .",
    "fortunately , such observations will shortly be available as the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) begins routine science operations .",
    "there is a compelling alternative explanation that has a more concrete physical motivation . in any protoplanetary disk , the thermal pressure of the gas",
    "is thought to cause it to orbit the star at slightly sub - keplerian rates , generating a small velocity difference relative to the particles embedded in it @xcite .",
    "depending on their size , particles can experience a head - wind from this gas drag that decays their orbits and sends them spiraling in toward the central star .",
    "this _ radial drift _ of particles modifies the radial dust - to - gas mass ratio profile and introduces a pronounced spatial gradient in the particle size distribution  in essence , it causes @xmath91 and @xmath145 to decrease with radius @xcite . in the outer disk , the drift rates",
    "are expected to be largest for millimeter - sized particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since thermal emission peaks at a wavelength comparable to the particle size , the drift process should then naturally produce a millimeter - wave emission profile that is considerably more compact than would be inferred from tracers of the gas @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dust particles that reflect light in the disk atmosphere are small enough to be dynamically coupled to the gas  therefore , scattered light images should be extended like the probes of the gas phase .    from a qualitative perspective ,",
    "our analysis of the co and dust structures in the tw hya disk are certainly consistent with a scenario where growth and radial drift have had an observable impact .",
    "however , it is unclear if realistic models of the growth and migration of solids in a disk like this can quantitatively account for the details . one particular challenge worth highlighting is related to timescales .",
    "the @xcite models suggest that millimeter - wave dust emission should be strongly attenuated on a timescale of @xmath51myr without constant replenishment ( presumably from growth and/or fragmentation ) .",
    "given the advanced age of tw hya ( @xmath58 - 20myr ) , this model would require either that replenishment shuts off after several myr or that drift is inefficient at early times before becoming more important later in the disk evolution process .",
    "if this is indeed the mechanism responsible for our results , additional observations of disks at a range of ages could be used to help calibrate models of the long - term evolution of drift rates .",
    "one potential way to test this hypothesis relies on the particle size dependence of the radial drift rates .",
    "the theory implies that larger particles will end up with more centrally concentrated density distributions . at long and optically thin wavelengths ,",
    "we expect that the size of the continuum emission region should be anti - correlated with wavelength ",
    "longer wavelengths imply more compact emission . in principle , this could be tested in the near future by combining high resolution alma and expanded very large array ( evla ) observations of the tw hya dust disk that span the millimeter / radio spectrum .    in many ways ,",
    "tw hya and its disk are unique and may not be representative of the bulk population of pre - main sequence stars and their circumstellar material .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth considering the broader implications of our findings for this specific example ",
    "they _ may _ prove to be more generally applicable .",
    "it is possible that the co - dust size discrepancy found here is present in most other millimeter - wave disk observations , but it would likely be difficult to identify with current sensitivity and resolution limitations . if that feature is common and its underlying cause is a drop in the dust - to - gas ratio in the outer disk , there would be serious consequences for disk mass estimates based on dust continuum measurements . there could be large and hidden mass reservoirs of molecular gas in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks , implying that disk masses might be substantially under - estimated . if true , gas densities at large disk radii may be higher than typically assumed , with profound implications for facilitating giant planet formation by gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if radial drift is the key process responsible for the apparent co - dust size discrepancy , it is also possible that any  primordial \" dust - to - gas ratio _ integrated over the entire disk _ is preserved",
    ". this would be the case if the millimeter - sized dust originally present at large radii had its inward migration halted before it was accreted onto the central star . in that scenario , the total disk mass estimates from millimeter - wave luminosities would still be relatively accurate ( assuming a proper model for the dust opacities that considers the simultaneous particle size evolution is available ) , although the densities in the outer disk would remain uncertain without measurements of optically thin gas emission lines .",
    "independent of the apparent co - dust size discrepancy , our finding that the millimeter - wave continuum emission from the tw hya disk is so sharply truncated comes as a surprise .",
    "modern interferometric datasets generally do not have sufficient sensitivity to differentiate between dust density models with sharp edges or smooth tapers ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given that ambiguity , it is possible that the edge feature we have identified in the 870@xmath1 m emission profile of the tw hya disk could be relatively common .",
    "moreover , it is tempting to associate this @xmath148au edge in the distribution of larger solid particles in the tw hya disk with the similarly abrupt truncation of the classical kuiper belt at @xmath149 - 50au in our solar system @xcite .",
    "if this behavior ends up being a generic feature in protoplanetary disks , it may signify an important diagnostic of the radial migration of disk solids and provide new insights into the structural origins and evolution of the outer solar system ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    further speculation on the generality of the features identified in the tw hya disk is unnecessary . with the recent start of alma science operations ,",
    "the quality of the data presented here will be matched ( and exceeded ) routinely for large samples , and the basic trends of disk properties like those probed here will be clarified .",
    "if the tw hya disk is not anomalous , it is clear that the general methods used to interpret observations of dust in disks will need to be modified to focus less on their bulk density structures and more on the dynamical evolution of their solid contents .",
    "we have presented sensitive , high resolution ( @xmath0au ) sma observations of the 870@xmath1 m continuum and co @xmath2=3@xmath32 line emission from the disk around the nearby young star tw hya .",
    "based on two different parametric formulations for the disk densities , we used radiative transfer calculations to compare the predicted radial structures of the dust and co gas in the tw hya disk with these sma observations and ancillary measurements of the spectral energy distribution . the key conclusions from this modeling analysis of these high - quality data include :    1 .   under the assumption that the dust - to - gas surface density ratio is constant with radius , we were not able to find any model structure that can simultaneously reproduce the resolved brightness profiles of the 870@xmath1 m continuum and co line emission .",
    "we have identified a clear co - dust size discrepancy that is present regardless of whether the assumed surface density profile has a sharp outer edge or a smooth ( exponential ) taper at large radii .",
    "the radial distribution of millimeter - sized dust grains in the tw hya disk is substantially more compact than its co gas reservoir .",
    "the 870@xmath1 m dust emission has a _ sharp _ outer edge near 60au , while the co emission ( and optical / infrared scattered light from small grains that are dynamically coupled to the gas ) extends to a radius of at least 215au .",
    "the observationally inferred co - dust size discrepancy could potentially be explained with a more complex dust density profile that exhibits a sudden decrease by a large factor near a radius of 60au . that  break \" in the density profile",
    "might be consistent with a tidal perturbation by a long - period ( unseen ) companion , although the dust at larger radii would then also have to be preferentially depleted of millimeter - sized grains .",
    "alternatively , the observations might have uncovered some preliminary evidence for a key evolutionary mechanism related to the planet formation process : the growth and inward migration of disk solids .",
    "the radial drift of millimeter - sized particles is expected to naturally concentrate long - wavelength thermal emission near the star relative to tracers of the molecular gas reservoir .",
    "however , a more detailed exploration of disk evolution models is needed to verify if the observations of the tw hya disk are quantitatively consistent with this scenario .",

    "<S> we present high resolution ( @xmath0au ) , high signal - to - noise ratio submillimeter array observations of the 870@xmath1 m ( 345ghz ) continuum and co @xmath2=3@xmath32 line emission from the protoplanetary disk around tw hya . using continuum and line radiative transfer calculations , those data and the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution </S>",
    "<S> are analyzed together in the context of simple two - dimensional parametric disk structure models . under the assumptions of a radially invariant dust population and ( vertically integrated ) gas - to - dust mass ratio , we are unable to simultaneously reproduce the co and dust observations with model structures that employ either a single , distinct outer boundary or a smooth ( exponential ) taper at large radii . instead , we find that the distribution of millimeter - sized dust grains in the tw hya disk has a relatively sharp edge near 60au , contrary to the co emission ( and optical / infrared scattered light ) that extends to a much larger radius of at least 215au . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some possible explanations for the observed radial distribution of millimeter - sized dust grains and the apparent co - dust size discrepancy , and suggest that they may be hallmarks of substructure in the dust disk or natural signatures of the growth and radial drift of solids that might be expected for disks around older pre - main sequence stars like tw hya . </S>"
