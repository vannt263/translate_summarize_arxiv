    "a lattice in euclidean space @xmath1 is _ well - rounded _ if the non - zero lattice vectors of minimal length span @xmath1 .",
    "well - rounded lattices are interesting for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the concept is put into a broader context by the notion of the _ successive minima _ of a lattice ( more precisely , of a norm function on a lattice ) . by definition ,",
    "a lattice is well - rounded if and only if all its @xmath0 successive minima ( norms of successively shortest linearly independent vectors ) are equal to each other .",
    "a first observation is that many important ` named ' lattices in higher - dimensional space are well - rounded , such as the leech lattice , the barnes - wall lattice(s ) , the coxeter - todd lattice , all irreducible root lattices , and many more  @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two reasons for this ( which often apply both ) .",
    "first of all , distinct successive minima give rise to proper subspaces of @xmath1 that are invariant under the orthogonal group ( automorphism group ) of the lattice .",
    "if this finite group acts irreducibly on @xmath1 , the lattice must be well - rounded .",
    "secondly , a lattice which gives rise to a locally densest sphere packing ( a so - called extreme lattice ) , is well - rounded .",
    "it is actually perfect by voronoi s famous theorem ( this part goes back to korkine and zolotareff ) , and it is easily seen that perfection implies well - roundedness ; compare @xcite .",
    "however , these two observations are not at the core of the notion .",
    "they might give the impression that well - rounded lattices are very rare or special , which is not the case . in terms of gram matrices or quadratic forms ,",
    "the well - rounded ones lie in a subspace of codimension @xmath2 in the space of all symmetric matrices , similarly for the cone of positive definite minkowski - reduced forms . despite its codimension",
    ", this subspace is large enough so that certain questions about general forms can be reduced to well - rounded ones .",
    "a good illustration for this is minkowski s proof of the fact that the geometric mean of all @xmath0 successive minima of a lattice is bounded by the same quantity @xmath3 as the first minimum ( see section  [ sec : tools ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the hermite constant in dimension @xmath0 , and for well - rounded lattices this estimate reduces to the definition of this constant .",
    "the proof is obtained by a certain deformation of the quadratic form ; see @xcite .",
    "a sharpened version of this technique asks for a diagonal matrix which transforms a given lattice into a well - rounded one . in general ,",
    "its existence is unknown , but c.  mcmullen  @xcite recently proved a weaker version which suffices for applications to minkowski s conjecture on the minimum of a ( multiplicative ) norm function on lattices .",
    "the method of proof is related to applications of well - rounded lattices to cohomology questions as described in the introduction of  @xcite ; compare the references given there .    having this kind of ` richness ' of well - rounded lattices in mind , it is tempting to ask how frequent they are in terms of counting sublattices",
    "so , the principal object of study in this paper is the function @xmath5    = n\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is an in principle arbitrary lattice , and @xmath7 $ ] denotes the index of @xmath8 in @xmath6 .",
    "this question is of interest already in dimension @xmath9 ( where some of the general features described above reduce to rather obvious facts ) .",
    "moreover , since the well - rounded sublattices are the objects of interest , and not so much the enveloping ` lattice of reference ' @xmath6 , it seems natural to focus mainly on the two most symmetric lattices , the hexagonal lattice and the square lattice . in this paper",
    ", we shall obtain complete and explicit results on the asymptotic number of well - rounded sublattices , as a function of the index , of the hexagonal lattice and of the square lattice .",
    "we also have results for general @xmath6 which are somewhat weaker , which seems to be unavoidable .",
    "in special situations , lattice enumeration problems have a long history .",
    "the coefficients of the dedekind zeta functions of an algebraic number field @xmath10 of degree @xmath0 over the rationals count the number of ideals of given index in the ring of integers @xmath11 , which is considered as a lattice in a well - known way  @xcite .",
    "the perhaps most basic result on lattice enumeration , which is also one of the most frequently rediscovered ones , is the determination of the number @xmath12 of all distinct sublattices of index @xmath13 in a given lattice @xmath14 .",
    "the result follows easily from the hermite normal form for integral matrices and reads @xmath15 with dirichlet series generating function @xmath16 ( compare @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; for several different proofs , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  15.1 ) ) .",
    "this result of eq .",
    "is insensitive to any geometric property of the lattice @xmath6 , in the sense that it is actually a result for the free abelian group of rank @xmath0 and its subgroups . in @xcite ,",
    "extensions to more general classes of finitely generated groups are treated .    as for lattices",
    ", it is natural to refine the question by looking at classes of sublattices with particular properties ( number - theoretic or geometric ) , possibly defined by an additional structure on the enveloping vector space .",
    "in addition to the classical case of the dedekind zeta function mentioned above , we are aware of only few , scattered results . quite a while ago , in @xcite , modules in an order in a semisimple algebra over a number field were considered .",
    "well - rounded lattices in dimension @xmath9 have recently been analysed in @xcite ; see also the references in @xcite .",
    "together with our earlier work on similar sublattices @xcite and on coincidence site sublattices ( csls ) @xcite , these papers were our starting point .",
    "one benefit of dirichlet series is the access to asymptotic results on the growth of a ( non - negative ) arithmetical function @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 in general need not behave regularly , in particular need not be monotone , one usually considers the average growth of @xmath17 , that is , one studies the summatory function @xmath19 . for the above counting function @xmath20 for sublattices ,",
    "the summatory function @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 with @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 otherwise , which follows from eq .   by applying delange s theorem",
    "; compare theorem  [ thm : meanvalues ] in appendix  [ app - sec : ana ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the gauss bracket , and thus @xmath28 . in dimension 2 ,",
    "@xmath29 , so we have the well - known asymptotic growth behaviour of the divisor function , whose error term can be estimated as ; see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm  3.4 ) .",
    "one can ask for a more refined description of the asymptotic growth of an arithmetic function , consisting of a main term for the summatory function , a term of second order ( a ` first order error term ' ) , and an error term of a strictly smaller order of magnitude than the term of second order . for instance , for the number of divisors of @xmath13 , it is known that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the euler  mascheroni constant ; compare  @xcite .",
    "so we have a term of second order which is linear in this case and thus of ` almost the same ' growth as the main term , whereas the error term is much smaller .",
    "the content of this paper can now be summarised as follows . in the short preparatory section  [ sec : tools ]",
    ", we recall a few facts about reduced bases and bravais classes of lattices in the plane , and state some auxiliary remarks about well - rounded ( sub-)lattices .    in section  [ sec : sq ] , we begin with an explicit description of all well - rounded sublattices of the square lattice , the latter viewed as the ring @xmath32 $ ] of gaussian integers . after these preparations ,",
    "the main result then is theorem  [ thm : sq2 ] , which gives a refined asymptotic description of the function @xmath33 , of the kind that we have explained above for the divisor function in eq .  ; the constants for the main term and the term of second order are determined explicitly .",
    "the proof relies on classic methods from analytic number theory , including delange s theorem and some elementary tools around euler s summation formula and dirichlet s hyperbola method .",
    "we describe the strategy and the main steps of the proof ; some of the details , which are long and technical , have been transferred to a supplement to this paper .",
    "a weaker result , namely the explicit asymptotics without the second - order term , is stated in theorem  [ thm : sq1 ] , which is fully proved here .",
    "section  [ sec : tr ] provides the analogous analysis for the hexagonal lattice , realised as the ring of eisenstein integers @xmath34 $ ] with @xmath35 ; theorems  [ thm : tri1 ] and  [ thm : tri2 ] are completely analogous to theorems  [ thm : sq1 ] and  [ thm : sq2 ] .",
    "the general case of well - rounded sublattices of two - dimensional case is treated in section  [ sec : gen ] , which is subdivided into two parts .",
    "the first one starts with a criterion for the existence of well - rounded sublattices .",
    "the lattices that have a well - rounded sublattice include all ` rational ' lattices , that is , lattices whose gram matrix consists of rational numbers ( or even rational integers ) , up to a common multiple .",
    "so these are exactly the lattices that correspond to integral quadratic forms in the classical sense .",
    "there is an interesting connection between well - rounded sublattices and csls , which is established in lemma  [ lem : brs ] . in the rest of this part",
    ", it is shown in theorem  [ thm : non - rat - growth ] that all non - rational lattices that contain well - rounded sublattices have essentially the same power - law growth ( linear ) of their average number @xmath36 .",
    "the second part of section  [ sec : gen ] deals with the behaviour of @xmath36 in the general rational case .",
    "the discussion is more complicated , but nevertheless we can show that the growth rate is proportional to @xmath37 , as in the square and hexagonal case .",
    "summarising , we see that three regimes exist as follows : a planar lattice can have many , some or no well - rounded sublattices , the first case is exactly the rational case , while the second case is explained by the existence of an essentially unique coincidence reflection .",
    "our paper is complemented by four appendices . in appendix",
    "[ app - sec : ana ] , some classic results about dirichlet series are collected in a way that suits our needs . in appendix",
    "[ app - sec : asym ] , we explicitly record the asymptotic behaviour of the number of similar sublattices of the square and the hexagonal lattice , which are a useful by - product of sections  [ sec : sq ] and  [ sec : tr ] .",
    "appendix  [ app - sec : index ] summarises key properties of a special type of sublattices that we need , while appendix  [ app - sec : epst ] recalls some facts about epstein s zeta functions .",
    "let us collect some simple , but useful facts from the geometric theory of lattices .",
    "we assume throughout this paper that we are in dimension @xmath38 , so we consider an arbitrary lattice @xmath8 in the euclidean plane .",
    "let @xmath39 be a shortest non - zero vector , and @xmath40 shortest among the lattice vectors linearly independent from @xmath41 . then @xmath42 form a basis of @xmath8 . ( the reader may consult ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ,  7.7 ) for this and for related statements below . ) changing the sign of @xmath43 if necessary , we may assume that the inner product satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "a basis of this kind is called a _ reduced basis _ of @xmath8 . by definition , we have the following chain of inequalities , @xmath45 in terms of the quantities @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , which are the entries of the gram matrix @xmath48 with respect to @xmath42",
    ", these conditions read @xmath49 conversely , if we start with any two linearly independent vectors @xmath50 satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ eq : red - basis ] ) or ( [ eq : red - gram ] ) , then @xmath50 form a reduced basis of the lattice that they generate . concerning the reduction conditions ( [ eq : red - basis ] ) , there are six cases possible for the pair @xmath42 as follows , @xmath51 it is well - known and easily shown that the entries @xmath52 of the gram matrix with respect to a reduced basis @xmath42 , only depend on the lattice , but not on the choice of the reduced basis @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , it is well - defined to talk about the _ geometric type _ of the lattice , which is one of the types ( a ) to ( f ) above . as a further consequence of this uniqueness property ,",
    "the orthogonal group @xmath53 acts transitively ( and thus sharply transitively ) on the set of all ( ordered ) reduced bases of @xmath8 .",
    "( by definition , @xmath54 is the set of orthogonal transformations of the enveloping vector space which maps the lattice into , and thus onto itself . )",
    "@xmath55 is cyclic of order 2 for lattices of general type , a dihedral group of order @xmath56 ( generated by two perpendicular reflections ) for the types ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , a dihedral group of order @xmath57 for the square lattice , and of order @xmath58 for the hexagonal lattice .",
    "typically , one wants to classify lattices only up to similarity , which means that the gram matrix may be multiplied with a positive constant . clearly , a square or hexagonal lattice is unique up to similarity .",
    "similarity classes of rhombic type depend on one parameter , the angle @xmath59 formed by @xmath41 and @xmath43 , where @xmath60 .",
    "the limiting cases @xmath61 and @xmath62 lead to the hexagonal , respectively square lattice .",
    "a lattice @xmath8 ( in any dimension ) is called _ rational _ if its similarity class contains a lattice with rational gram matrix .",
    "the _ discriminant _ @xmath63 of a lattice @xmath8 is the determinant of any of its gram matrices .",
    "( this is the square of the volume of a fundamental domain for the action of @xmath8 by translations . )",
    "two lattices @xmath64 ( on the same space ) are called _ commensurate _ ( or commensurable ) if their intersection @xmath65 has finite index in both .",
    "equivalently , there exists a non - zero integer @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "this in turn is equivalent to the condition that @xmath6 and @xmath8 generate the same space over the rationals , @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath6 and @xmath8 are commensurate , the ratio of their discriminants is a rational square .",
    "a _ coincidence isometry _ for @xmath8 is an isometry ( an orthogonal transformation @xmath69 of the underlying real space ) such that @xmath8 and @xmath70 are commensurate . in earlier work  @xcite",
    ", we have introduced the notation @xmath71 for the set of all coincidence isometries for @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath72 , it follows that @xmath73 ( see above ) , i.e.  @xmath69 induces an orthogonal transformation of the rational space @xmath74 .",
    "conversely , any such orthogonal transformation maps @xmath8 onto a lattice of full rank in the same rational space , which , by the above remarks , is commensurate with @xmath8 . altogether , @xmath71 is equal to the rational orthogonal group @xmath75 ( in particular , it is a group ) . if @xmath6 and @xmath8 are commensurate , their groups of coincidence isometries coincide , @xmath76 a _ coincidence site lattice _",
    "( csl ) for @xmath8 is a sublattice of the form @xmath77 with @xmath72 ; see @xcite for further motivation concerning this notion .",
    "geometric types as introduced above are closely related , but not identical , with the so - called _ bravais types _ of lattices , which are defined in any dimension .",
    "two lattices @xmath6 and @xmath8 are bravais equivalent if and only if there exists a linear transformation which maps @xmath6 onto @xmath8 and also conjugates @xmath78 into @xmath55 .",
    "the bravais type ( or bravais class ) of a lattice depends only on its geometric type ; the centred rectangular and the rhombic lattices belong to the same bravais type ( thus we call them lattices ) .",
    "otherwise , geometric types and bravais types ( or rather the respective equivalence classes of lattices ) coincide .",
    "let us return to well - rounded lattices . clearly , a planar lattice is well - rounded if and only if it is of rhombic , square or hexagonal type .",
    "any lattice contains a rectangular sublattice of index @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath41 and @xmath43 form a reduced basis , then @xmath79 and @xmath80 are orthogonal , and form a reduced basis of the desired sublattice .",
    "conversely , if @xmath50 is a reduced basis of a rectangular lattice , and if we further assume that @xmath81 , then @xmath80 and @xmath82 form a reduced basis of a rhombic sublattice of index @xmath9 .",
    "( if @xmath83 , this sublattice is hexagonal , whereas for @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 , and thus the vectors are not shortest any more ; in this case , the sublattice is centred rectangular . )    similarly , a hexagonal lattice contains a rectangular sublattice of index @xmath9 , or more precisely , it contains exactly three rectangular sublattices of index @xmath9 for symmetry reasons .",
    "analogously , the square lattice contains precisely one square sublattice of index @xmath9 .",
    "we use the gaussian integers as a representation of the square lattice . note that there is no hexagonal sublattice of @xmath32 $ ] ( consider the discriminant ) .",
    "hence , all well - rounded sublattices are either rhombic or square lattices , which we treat separately , in line with the geometric classification explained above .    a fundamental quantity that will appear frequently below is the dirichlet series generating function for the number of similar sublattices of @xmath32 $ ] , compare @xcite , which is equal to the dedekind zeta function of the quadratic field @xmath86 , @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is riemann s zeta function , and @xmath89 is the @xmath90-series corresponding to the dirichlet character @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 see @xcite and appendix  [ app - sec : ana ] .    before dealing with the well - rounded sublattices ,",
    "let us consider all and square sublattices of @xmath32 $ ] ( recall that the term ` ' means rhombic or centred rectangular ) .",
    "let @xmath93 $ ] be any two elements of equal norm .",
    "the sublattice @xmath94 is of rhombic or centred rectangular or square type , and every or square sublattice is obtained in this way ( see section 2 ) .",
    "we can write @xmath95 and @xmath96 as @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 are integers and @xmath100 is primitive , which means that @xmath101 and @xmath102 are relatively prime . w.l.o.g . , we may assume that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are positive ( interchange @xmath105 and @xmath106 if necessary ) .",
