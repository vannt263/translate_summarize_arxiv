    "the observation of a five - quark bound system consisting of uudd@xmath4 , referred to as the @xmath5 pentaquark , have been reported in photon - nucleus and kaon - nucleus reactions .",
    "the presence of this state was predicted by r. l. jaffe with multiquark bag models and later by d. diakonov et al .",
    "using chiral soliton models of baryons @xcite .",
    "the high energies and particle densities resulting from collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) are expected to be ideal environments for pentaquark production @xcite .    during the expansion of the hot and dense matter ( fireball ) created in au+au collisions , chemical freeze - out",
    "is reached when the hadrons stop interacting inelastically .",
    "elastic interactions continue until thermal freeze - out . due to the very short lifetime ( @xmath6 ) of resonances ,",
    "a large fraction of the decays occur during this time .",
    "the elastic interactions of decay products with the surrounding particles result in a signal loss in the particle identification though this is offset by secondary interactions which increase the resonance yield ( e.g. @xmath7 + @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath0 , k+p @xmath9 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the contribution of re - scattering and regeneration on the total observed yields depends on the time span between the chemical and thermal freeze - out and the lifetime of each resonances @xcite .",
    "thus the study of resonances provides an additional tool in the determination of the hadronic expansion time between chemical and thermal freeze - out by comparing resonance to stable particle ratios .",
    "the data analyzed were taken by the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment@xcite , one of the four experiments at rhic .",
    "the large acceptance of star s time projection chamber ( tpc ) is ideal for such rare particle searches .",
    "the star trigger detectors consist of two zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) which are situated @xmath10 17 m downstream of the nominal interaction point as well as a central trigger barrel ( ctb ) surrounding the tpc .",
    "a minimum bias trigger is defined by the coincident measurement of spectator neutrons in both zdcs .",
    "the ctb an array of scintillator slats , is used to detect event multiplicity , is used to trigger on the 10% most central au+au collisions . for p+p collisions ,",
    "a minimum bias trigger is defined by coincidences in the two beam - beam counters , which are again scintillator detectors and are situated around the beam pipe , approximately 2 m from the center of the tpc .",
    "the main detector component of star is the tpc , which , together with the magnetic field information , is used to identify stable charged particles via energy loss per unit length and long - lived weakly decaying ( @xmath11 few cm ) neutral particles such as @xmath7 and @xmath12 via their decay topology .",
    "the direct measurement of resonances is not possible due to their short lifetimes ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "instead , @xmath0 resonances are identified by the invariant mass after combining @xmath8 with @xmath7 decay particle candidates . a mixed event technique , where particles from different events are reconstructed using the same technique , is used to determine the background for uncorrelated pair combinations .",
    "the @xmath0 signal is obtained by the subtraction of this normalized mixed event background from the invariant mass distribution @xcite .",
    "this technique can directly be applied for the search and possible identification of pentaquarks . for the case of the @xmath5 pentaquark study",
    "the invariant mass reconstruction is via @xmath14 , and subtraction of the normalized mixed event background is used @xcite .",

    "however , this empirical parametrization does not represent the behavior of the higher mass particles .",
    "similarly the blast wave parametrization which can describe the lower mass particles in au+au collisions ( @xmath26 of all the particles observed ) fails to explain the behavior of higher mass particles .",
    "the comparison of lighter , weakly decaying particles and heavier resonances in p+p and au+au collision environments shows a similar behavior of @xmath3 for the higher mass particles .",
    "it is expected that resonances with higher transverse momentum are more likely to be reconstructed in au+au collisions because of their longer relative lifetimes due to lorentz contraction .",
    "this means they are more likely to decay outside the medium and hence their daughter particles would interact less with the medium .",
    "any loss at low @xmath1 would increase the @xmath27 parameter of the @xmath1 spectra for the central au+au collisions with respect to p+p collisions .",
    "however we do not see any significant increase in the @xmath27 parameter for @xmath0 from p+p to the most central au+au collisions within the statistical and systematic errors .",
    "if higher mass particles are produced by different production mechanisms than the lower mass particles , we might be introducing a bias in our measurement in p+p collisions .",
    "this may be due to a number of reasons which include higher mass particles being produced in more violent ( mini - jet ) p+p collisions and/or the heavier particles flow radially with a smaller velocity than the lighter mass particles ( such as @xmath8 mesons ) in the most central au+au collisions .",

    "is one third that of the @xmath31 , it is expected that there should be an even greater signal loss via re - scattering .",
    "the observed unsuppressed ratio requires a significant regeneration mechanism in order to recover the signal loss via re - scattering .",
    "the measured @xmath32 ratio is @xmath33 for the 0 - 5% most central collisions which is about a factor of 2 below the microscopic model urqmd predictions at @xmath20 gev .",
    "this suggests that the assumed regeneration cross - section , included in urqmd calculations , is too high @xcite .",

    "the background pairs per event in the 1.54@xmath51 mev mass range is 3200 .",

    "the invariant mass spectra that are observed for the @xmath5 in p+p , d+au and au+au collision events are consistent with our estimations for the significance of the signal given our current statistics .",

    "@xmath19 resonances and their antiparticles can be reconstructed via event mixing techniques in p+p , d+au and au+au collision environments with star .",
    "the @xmath53 @xmath54 in p+p collisions is similar within the errors to that measured in au+au collisions .",
    "this follows the behavior of the other high mass particles ( @xmath55 gev ) whose @xmath17 measurement in p+p approaches the au+au value .",
    "this behavior suggests a possible smaller radial flow for heavy particles with respect to @xmath8 and/or a more violent production mechanism for heavy particles in p+p collisions .    there is no significant suppression observed in the @xmath28 ratios from p+p to @xmath21 central au+au collisions .",
    "since the previously measured suppression of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ratios agrees with a signal loss via rescattering in the medium , the absence of suppression in the @xmath0 ratio suggests a significant regeneration mechanism to recover the signal lost via rescattering @xcite .",
    "acceptance and efficiency studies show that we should be able to find @xmath34 pentaquarks at the few % level with the current data - set in d+au and au+au collisions .",
    "optimization of cuts to improve the signal over background is in progress .",
    "there is a possibility of measuring anti - pentaquarks at rhic since the antibaryon to baryon ratio is approaching to one @xcite .",
