    "<S> the symmetry - projected ansatz can account for static correlations in a computationally efficient way . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a variational extension of this methodology applicable to excited states of the same symmetry as the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> benchmark calculations on the c@xmath0 dimer with a modest basis set , which allows comparison with full configuration interaction results , indicate that this extension provides a high quality description of the low - lying spectrum for the entire dissociation profile . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the same methodology to obtain the full low - lying vertical excitation spectrum of formaldehyde , in good agreement with available theoretical and experimental data , as well as to a challenging model @xmath1 insertion pathway for beh@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the variational excited state methodology developed in this work has two remarkable traits : it is fully black - box and will be applicable to fairly large systems thanks to its mean - field computational cost . </S>"
