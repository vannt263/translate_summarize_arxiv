    "the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been the subject of extensive research for many years .",
    "the ferromagnetism , being usually much stronger than superconductivity , is supposed to destroy the latter .",
    "this suppression is caused by two mechanisms .",
    "one of them is related to the internal magnetic field which is created by the ordered magnetic moments .",
    "the internal magnetic field , which is proportional to the magnetization @xmath9 , induces meissner currents and suppresses the superconducting order parameter @xmath10 .",
    "this mechanism was first analyzed by ginsburg @xcite .",
    "he concluded that the coexistence phase could not take place in an ordinary bulk sample .",
    "the second mechanism is due to the direct action of an exchange field @xmath1 on spins of electrons@xcite .",
    "the exchange field tends to align the spins of the electrons in one direction and thereby destroys the singlet cooper pairs .",
    "the influence of the magnetization on the orbital condensate motion may be reduced drastically if the magnetization changes its direction on the scale of the superconducting correlation length in such a way that the averaged magnetic field is zero ( as in the case of a spiral magnetic structure ) .",
    "the action of the exchange field may be also decreased if it is realized via the rkky interaction @xcite ( for details see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism was observed in ternary rare earth compounds @xcite .",
    "the layered superconductor / ferromagnet ( s / f ) structures open new possibilities to achieve the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity . in such systems",
    "ferromagnetic and superconducting regions are spatially separated ; therefore if the magnetization is oriented parallel to the layers , it does not strongly affect the condensate in the s layers .",
    "on the other hand the cooper pairs penetrates into the f layer over a length which in the dirty limit ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the elastic scattering time ) is of the order of @xmath13 , where @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient in the f layer .",
    "the s / f structure becomes superconducting if the f layers are thin enough .",
    "layered structures can be created artificially or can be found in some high-@xmath5 cuprates , as in the compound @xmath14 ( @xmath15 : rare earth ) .",
    "its structure is similar to the one of the high-@xmath5material @xmath16 .",
    "magnetic ordering in @xmath17 layers ( it is assumed that mostly an antiferromagnetic order is realized ) occurs at @xmath18 and superconducting transition presumably in @xmath19 layers occurs at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that another material from the rutinate class , @xmath21 is an exotic triplet superconductor @xcite .",
    "a few interesting effects were predicted and observed in layered s / f structures . since the experimental pioneering work performed by werthamer et al .",
    "@xcite , it is known that the superconducting critical temperature @xmath22 is lowered in s / f multilayered structure with increasing thickness of the f layers .",
    "this is due to the proximity effect , i.e. superconductivity in the s layer is suppressed to some extent if it is brought into contact with a non - superconducting ( specially magnetic ) layer .",
    "another interesting phenomenon which can occur in s / f layered structures is an oscillatory dependence of the critical temperature @xmath22 and the critical current on the thickness of the f layer @xcite .",
    "these oscillations are related to oscillations of the condensate in the f layers which can be formally obtained by the replacement @xmath23 @xmath24 ( here @xmath25 is the matsubara frequency which enters in the expression for the condensate green s functions ) .",
    "an interesting behavior of the critical josephson current @xmath26 as a function of the exchange field @xmath1 was predicted first by bulaevskii et al .",
    "@xcite ; they found that with increasing @xmath1 the current @xmath26 changes sign and the phase difference @xmath27 is established in a josephson s / f / s junction ( the so called @xmath28-junction ) .",
    "this prediction was confirmed in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "despite of a large number of theoretical works on equilibrium and nonequilibrium effects in s / f / s structures , some important features of the effects remain unclear . in this report",
    "we discuss the influence of different relative orientations of the magnetizations on the critical josephson current in a tunnel sf / i / fs  junction .",
    "its electrodes consist of sf bilayers .",
    "the critical current @xmath26 is",
    "not zero if the thickness of the ferromagnetic f layer is thin enough and depends on relative orientation and absolute values of magnetization or exchange energy @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly the current @xmath26 turns out to be not decreasing , but increasing function of @xmath1 in the case of antiferromagnetic configuration ( the magnetization vectors are aligned in opposite directions in the electrodes ) .",
    "therefore the critical current at nonzero @xmath1 exceeds its value in the absence of @xmath1 .",
    "the second problem which we discuss here is a possible mechanism of the enhanced conductance measured experimentally in mesoscopic s / f structures .",
    "recent experiments on s / f structures showed that below the critical temperature @xmath22 the conductance of the ferromagnetic wire ( or film ) varies with the temperature in a nonmonotonic way and may exceed its value above @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the conductance , which was also observed , has been explained in a few theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "although it was assumed in some papers @xcite that an increase in the conductance may be due to scattering at the s / f interface , careful measurements demonstrated that the entire change of the conductance is due to an increase of the conductivity of the ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "such an increase would not be a great surprise if instead of the ferromagnet one had a normal metal n. it is well known ( see for review @xcite ) that in s / n structures the proximity effect can lead to a considerable increase of the conductance of the n wire provided its length does not exceed the phase breaking length @xmath29 .",
    "however , in a s / f structure if the superconducting pairing is singlet , the proximity effect is negligible at distances exceeding a much shorter length @xmath30 where @xmath1 is the exchange energy in the ferromagnet .",
    "this reduction of the proximity effect due to the exchange field of the ferromagnet is clear from the picture of cooper pairs consisting of electrons with opposite spins .",
    "the proximity effect is not considerably affected by the exchange energy only if the latter is small enough , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 . in the experiments of refs.@xcite strong ferromagnets , as @xmath32 or @xmath33 , were used .",
    "their exchange energy @xmath1 is by several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath22 , and therefore a singlet pairing is impossible due to the strong difference in the energy dispersions of the two spin bands . at the same time , an arbitrary exchange field can not destroy a triplet superconducting pairing because the spins of the electrons forming cooper pairs are already parallel .",
    "we suggest a new mechanism for the increase of the conductance in s / f structures .",
    "this mechanism is based on the formation of the triplet component in the f wire , which is due to a local inhomogeneity of the magnetization @xmath9 in the vicinity of the s / f interface .",
    "we show that the inhomogeneity generates a triplet component of the superconducting order parameter with an amplitude comparable with that of the singlet pairing .",
    "the penetration length of the triplet component into the ferromagnet is equal to @xmath34 , where the energy @xmath35 is of the order of temperature @xmath36 or the thouless energy @xmath37 @xmath38 is the sample size .",
    "the length @xmath39 is of the same order as that for the penetration of the superconducting pairs into a normal metal and therefore the increase of the conductance due to the proximity effect can be compared to that in an s / n structure .",
    "the inhomogeneity may appear in a natural way as an edge effect or may be created intentionally .",
    "the triplet component we considered differs from that in @xmath40 ; it is almost symmetrical in momentum @xmath41 ( the antisymmetrical part is small ) and is an odd function of the matsubara frequency @xmath42 .",
    "this type of the odd triplet component was for the first time suggested by berezinskii @xcite as a possible condensate phase in superfluid he@xmath43 ( in fact a condensate function symmetrical in @xmath42 and antisymmetrical in momentum @xmath44 takes place in he@xmath43 ) .",
    "later the so called odd superconductivity was discussed in refs.@xcite as a possible mechanism for high @xmath22 superconductivity .",
    "this odd in @xmath42 and even in @xmath44 condensate component is not suppressed by the impurity scattering .",
    "in this section we consider a layered system consisting of two f / s bilayers separated by an insulating layer ( see fig.1 ) . in this case",
    "the josephson critical current is determined by the transparency of the insulating layer and depends on the relative orientation of magnetization in the f layers .",
    "we assume that the f and the s layers @xmath45 are thin enough : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . with this assumption",
    "one comes to effective values of the superconducting order parameter @xmath49 , of the coupling constant @xmath50 , and of the magnetic moment @xmath51 described by the following equations @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the densities of states in the superconductor and ferromagnet , respectively .",
    "first , we analyze the case of a high s / f interface transparency , i.e. @xmath56 . under these conditions",
    "all the green s functions are nearly constant in space and continuous across the s / f interface .    in order to find the green s functions we use the usadel equation @xcite , which in the presence of a nonhomogeneous exchange field has the general form    @xmath57 + \\left[\\check{m}_{h},\\check{{\\bf g}}% \\right]\\!\\ ! = \\!\\!0",

    "the authors have found the conditions under which the system undergoes a transition to the @xmath97 state ; however they analyzed only the case of parallel magnetization .",

    "( [ crit_curr_para ] ) we assumed that @xmath51 and @xmath101 are the same in both bilayers ( symmetric structure ) .",
    "the dependence of the critical current on the exchange field @xmath51 is shown in fig.2 . at @xmath102",
    "the current @xmath26 is constant up to the value @xmath103 where it drops to zero ; @xmath104 is the effective energy gap @xmath105 at zero temperature and zero exchange field .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the order parameter @xmath106 is also constant .",
    "we do not consider here a possible transition to the loff phase predicted by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite and fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite for the region @xmath107 .",
    "we argue that since the homogeneous superconducting state in this region is a metastable state , its realization is possible .",
    "nevertheless our result is definitely valid for the region of small @xmath51 , and a possible transition to the loff would manifest itself in a drop of the the critical current .",
    "more interesting is the case when the relative orientation of the magnetizations is antiparallel , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "this case was considered in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , the critical current is given by the expression @xmath109 in this case the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath51 is completely different from that given by eq .",
    "( [ crit_curr_para ] ) ( see fig.3 ) . the critical current determined by eq .",

    "of course , there is no real divergence of @xmath26 since , for example , finite temperatures smear out this divergency .",
    "the critical current has a maximum at some value of @xmath112 close to @xmath104 . with decreasing @xmath36 the maximum value of @xmath26 increases and its position",
    "is shifted towards @xmath104 .",
    "for arbitrary relative orientations of magnetizations the expression for @xmath113 can be presented in the form @xmath114 therefore , the singular part is always present and its contribution reaches 100% at @xmath108 .",
    "all the conclusions given above remain valid also for two magnetic superconductors with uniformly oriented magnetizations in each layer . as in the previous case of parallel orientations ,",
    "the state with @xmath115 might be unreachable for the antiparallel orientation due to the appearance of the inhomogeneous loff state .",
    "however the singular behavior of @xmath26 can be realized at smaller values of @xmath1 in a structure with large enough s / f interface resistance @xmath116 . in this case",
    "the bulk properties of the s film are not changed by the proximity of the f film ( to be more precise the condition @xmath117 must be satisfied ; @xmath118 is the specific resistance of the f film ) .",
    "then , as one can readily show @xcite , a subgap @xmath119 arises in the f layer .",
    "the green s functions in the f layer have the same form as in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz1 ] ) with @xmath105 replaced by @xmath120 .",
    "the singularity in @xmath121 occurs at @xmath51 equals to @xmath120 , and the loff state does not arise because the subgap @xmath120 is not determined by the self - consistency equation .",
    "another model of a sf / i / fs josephson junction was considered in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the authors assumed that @xmath122 and that the conductance of the s layer in the normal state is much larger than the conductance of the f layer . according to this model",
    "the critical current may either increase or decrease as a function of @xmath1 , and for certain values of @xmath1 may become negative ( @xmath123-junction ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that real structures are much more complicated than the models presented above . in order to obtain a complete description of the systems one should take into account that electrons with up and down spins have different density - of - states , conductivities and transmission coefficient through the s / f interface .",
    "although in almost all known superconductors cooper pairs are in spin singlet state , the triplet superconductivity have been studied in some works .",
    "many years ago berezinskii studied a possible triplet phase in superfluid @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "the triplet component of the condensate function proposed in ref.@xcite was odd in frequency and even in momentum .",
    "however nowadays it is known that this hypothetical condensate function does not take place in @xmath124 .",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath125 @xcite has arisen the general interest in triplet superconductivity . in the case of s / f structures , the possible role of a triplet component in transport properties",
    "was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in both cases",
    "the triplet component arose as a result of mesoscopic fluctuations , and the correction to the conductance were very small . in this section",
    "we suggest another mechanism of formation of triplet pairing in s / f structures .",
    "this is due to a local inhomogeneity of the magnetization in the vicinity of the s / f interface .",
    "we consider the system shown in fig.4 and assume that the magnetization orientation varies linearly from @xmath98 at @xmath126 to @xmath127 at @xmath128 . here",
    "@xmath129 is the angle between @xmath9 and the @xmath130-axis ( the @xmath131-axis is parallel to the f wire ) .",
    "thus in this region the magnetization is given by @xmath132 we also consider the diffusive limit corresponding to short mean free path and to the condition @xmath133 .",
    "thus we may describe the system using eq .",
    "[ usadel ] .",
    "this equation contains the normal @xmath73 and anomalous @xmath134 green s functions , which are @xmath135 matrices in the nambu@xmath136spin space .",
    "due to the strong mismatch of the fermi surfaces the transmission coefficient through the s / f interface is small and therefore we can assume that the anomalous condensate function @xmath134 is also small .",
    "in the case of high transparency the order parameter in the superconductor might be suppressed , and therefore it is also possible to assume a weak proximity effect .",
    "thus in both cases we can use the linearized usadel equation for the retarded matrix ( in spin space ) green s function @xmath137 , which has the form(the index @xmath15 is dropped )    @xmath138    here the matrix @xmath139 is defined as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 varies with @xmath131 as shown in fig.4 .",

    "they are of the same order in the vicinity of the s / f interface , but while the singlet component decays abruptly over a short distance ( @xmath198 ) , the triplet one varies smoothly along the ferromagnet , turning to zero at the f reservoir . in fig.5",

    "we have shown that in contrast to a common view , in the case of an antiparallel configuration ( the magnetization vectors in the s / f electrodes are antiparallel to each other ) the critical current @xmath26 increases with the increasing exchange field @xmath1 .",
    "this means that in a s / f - i - f / s junction the current @xmath26 can be even greater than that in a s - i - s junction with the same s electrodes .",
    "secondly we have calculated the conductance of a mesoscopic f wire attached to a superconductor s. we have shown that in the presence of a local inhomogeneity near the s / f interface , both singlet and triplet components of the condensate are created in the ferromagnetic wire due to the proximity effect .",
    "the singlet component penetrates into the ferromagnet over a short length @xmath177 , whereas the triplet component can spread over the full mesoscopic length of the ferromagnet .",
    "this long - range penetration of the triplet component should lead to a significant variation of the ferromagnet conductance below @xmath22 .",
