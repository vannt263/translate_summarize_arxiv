    "over the last two decades , the rapid development of single molecule manipulation techniques has produced dramatic advances in chemistry and molecular physics .",
    "the fields of dna biotechnology and nanofabrication in particular , have benefited from these advances . in turn",
    ", successes in the field of dna biotechnology have further motivated the study of dna manipulation techniques , with a strong focus on studying mechanisms of inducing dna dehybridization ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this study , we consider dehybridizing dna by pulling dna molecules through a transmembrane channel . this work is motivated in part by the experimental results of nakane _",
    "@xcite , and bates _ el al .",
    "_ @xcite . in the experiments of nakane , a probe dna that extends 14 base pairs beyond the opening of a trans - membrane channel",
    "is used to capture a 14 base pair target strand ( see fig [ fig1 ] ) . in order to prevent complete passage of the probe dna through the membrane channel",
    ", the probe was attached to an avidin anchor protein by a 50-base poly - a tail .",
    "the target strands used in the experiments were either completely homologous to the probe strand , or had one nonhomologous  defect \" base .",
    "after the probe strand had captured a target strand , a transmembrane voltage was applied to pull the probe strand through an @xmath0-hemolysin channel embedded in a lipid membrane . as the @xmath0-hemolysin channel could only accommodate _",
    "single - stranded _ dna molecules , any target strand hybridized with the probe dna would need to detach completely before the probe could be fully drawn into the channel .",
    "as the transmembrane voltage was applied , the ionic current through the @xmath0-hemolysin channel was simultaneously monitored . when any part of the probe strand was inside the channel , the channel was blocked , and the ionic current fell below the measurement threshold .",
    "when the probe strand was completely pulled through the channel ( after the target strand detached ) , ionic currents resumed and were measured .",
    "thus , in the experiment of nakane , the distribution of first passage times , @xmath1 , for the escape of the probe dna from the @xmath0-hemolysin channel was measured .    in order to understand the first passage times observed in these experiments , we have produced estimates for the thermally averaged mean first passage time @xmath2 using simple two - dimensional and one - dimensional stochastic models .",
    "we model the dna hybridization energetics using both a simple free energy model where each hybridized base contributes an equal amount to the total free energy , and using free energies produced by the mfold 2-state hybridization server @xcite .",
    "our predicted mean first passage times show the same qualitative features observed by nakane _",
    "_ under the influence of small transmembrane voltages , the first passage times are found to depend strongly on the presence and energy of defects in the target dna strand . as the transmembrane voltage is increased , a distinct roll - over in the predicted first passage times",
    "is observed , and the first passage times become relatively insensitive to the presence of defects on the target dna strand . we propose that this roll - over in @xmath3 represents a transition between a thermally - dominated dehybridization mechanism in the low voltage regime , and a driven stripping mechanism in the high voltage regime .",

    "_ @xcite and poland and scheraga @xcite , we model the process of dna probe extraction using a two - sided zipper model described in fig .",
    "this model generates @xmath7 distinct partial dehybridization states labeled @xmath8 , were @xmath9 is the number of bases at the @xmath10 end of the probe that are dehybridized _ and _ have been pulled into the transmembrane region , and @xmath11 is the number of dehybridized bases at the @xmath12 end of the dna probe . using this nomenclature , the dna probe is fully dehybridized when @xmath13 , and fully _ extracted _ only when @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that his model neglects the effects of internal dehybridization bubbles , which will be discussed later in this section . defining @xmath16",
    "to be the probability of being in state @xmath8 at time @xmath17 , given that the system was initially in state @xmath18 , we find the system evolves according to a master equation    @xmath19    in order to produce the elements @xmath20 of the transition matrix , we define the following five transition mechanisms between states @xmath8 :    @xmath21 bond breaking : :    [ rate3 ] the hydrogen bonds between bases at the @xmath10 end    of the probe dna break , the probe dna base moves into the    transmembrane region , and the state shifts from    @xmath8 to @xmath22 .",
    "this    transition path includes a bond breaking event , immediately followed    by translation of the probe dna , and occurs at rate    +    @xmath23    +    where @xmath24 is the change in free energy between the    current state @xmath25 and the target state    @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a    phenomenological attempt frequency .",
    "we note that we could express    @xmath27 as the product of an attempt frequency and a free    energy barrier    @xmath28 .",
    "however for    the @xmath10 bond - breaking transition , as well as all other    transitions in our model , we pull any dependence on the barrier energy    into the effective attempt frequency . as this state transition    involves a net translation of a partially charged nucleotide across    the membrane , a drop in the interaction energy between the applied    electric field and the probe dna occurs : @xmath29    +    where @xmath30 is the mean partial charge of a dna base . @xmath21",
    "bond formation : :    [ rate4 ] in the reverse of the @xmath10 bond breaking    transition , the probe dna translates one base in the @xmath12    direction , and corresponding bases on the probe and the target dna    strands hybridize .",
    "this shifts the system from the    @xmath8 state to the @xmath31    state , and occurs at rate    +    @xmath32 @xmath33 bond breaking : :    [ rate1 ] the hydrogen bonds between two hybridized bases located at the    @xmath12 end of the probe break , thus increasing    @xmath11 by one .",
    "this transition is assumed to occur with    rate    +    @xmath34 @xmath35 bond formation : :    [ rate2 ] corresponding dehybridized bases at the @xmath12 end    of the probe strand and the @xmath10 end of the target dna    strand form a bond , decreasing @xmath11 by one .",
    "this    transition is assumed to occur at rate    +    @xmath36 @xmath37 free translation : :    [ rate5 ] in the case where the dna probe is completely dehybridized    @xmath38 , but not fully extracted    @xmath39 , the dna probe will translate under the    influence of the applied potential .",
    "the translation changes the state    from @xmath8 to @xmath40 or    @xmath41 and occurs with rate    +    @xmath42    +    the two rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 describe    translation in the @xmath10 and @xmath12 directions    respectively .",
    "the only significant difference between    @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the sign of the change in    the interaction energy between the probe dna and the applied electric    field . in the case of @xmath10 translation    @xmath45 , while in the case of @xmath12    translation @xmath46 .",
    "having defined the possible transitions in the model , we are left with five unknown attempt frequencies @xmath47 , and an unknown value for the mean partial charge per dna base @xmath30 . based on the results of nakane , we set @xmath48 @xcite , were @xmath49 is the electron charge .",
    "since free translation and @xmath10 bond breaking both involve sliding of the probe dna strand , the time scale for these transitions is set approximately by the time scale for translation of the single - stranded probe dna . to find this time scale",
    ", we built a simplified model of single - stranded dna translation consisting of only the free translation moves described above . using this model",
    ", we simulated the complete passage of a 60-base single - stranded dna segment through a channel 30 dna bases in length .",
    "we then compared the mean first passage time for complete transit of single - stranded dna computed from this model , with the experimental results of bates _",
    "@xcite for dna transport through @xmath0-hemolysin channels at low voltages ( @xmath50 at 20mv , @xmath51 at 40mv ) .",
    "the best match between the computed and experimental results occurred when the attempt frequency was approximately @xmath52 . to determine a value for @xmath53 , we followed cocco _",
    "_ @xcite and set @xmath53 to equal the inverse self diffusion time for a single nucleotide ( @xmath54 ) . with rough order of magnitude estimates for @xmath27 and @xmath53",
    "we then tuned the parameters of our model to give a reasonable match to the experimental data of nakane @xcite for the variation of escape time with voltage .",
    "after hand tuning , the parameters were @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .    while easy to analyze , our model fails to capture a number of aspects of the denaturation and extraction process .",
    "for example , by assuming the short probe - target dna complex denatures only from the ends , we have ignored the effects of bubble formation . by bubbles we refer to dehybridized regions of dna that are bounded by at least one hybridized base on both sides . while clearly an approximation , we do not believe that bubble formation will qualitatively affect the process of driven dna hybridization described here . under physiologic conditions , structural fluctuations in double stranded dna lead to the formation of bubbles that are typically on the order of several tens of base pairs @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the dehybridization and extraction of dna strands only 10 - 20 bases in length , and thus considerably smaller than the typical bubble size found in dna at physiologic conditions .",
    "additionally , recent experiments @xcite have studied the formation of bubbles in small , atypically bubble - prone , poly - at dna chains approximately @xmath60 bases in length . here ,",
    "the formation of dna bubbles approximately @xmath61 bases in length were observed in the dna strand .",
    "however , through fluorescence - correlation spectroscopy altan - bonnet @xcite were able to measure the typical lifetime of these small bubbles to be approximately 50@xmath62 .",
    "this lifetime is typically much smaller than the mean time for the dehybridization and extraction of small dna strands through @xmath0-hemolysin at moderate driving voltages .",
    "additionally we do not model partial - registry binding , where the target dna binds to the probe dna with an offset so that the target dna `` over - hangs '' the probe .",
    "if we assume that the target - probe dna complex is well equilibrated prior to the start of the extraction processes , then such out of registry binding is unlikely due to its high energetic cost .",
    "moreover , should such binding occur , its effects on the dna dehybridization process would not be qualitatively different from the effects of starting in a @xmath8 state with a similar number of unhybridized bases .    finally , we do not model the full extraction of the probe dna ( _ i.e. , _ full removal from the @xmath0-hemolysin channel ) . as re - binding of the target dna is unlikely",
    "once the probe is fully drawn into the channel ( typical target concentrations are 10@xmath63 m @xcite ) , complete removal of the probe dna depends primarily on the details of the dna - channel interactions .",
    "previous studies @xcite , have shown that translation of single - stranded dna 60 bases in length under moderate driving ( 0.04v ) in an @xmath0-hemolysin channel occurs on a time scale of 500@xmath63s . rather than model the interactions between the probe dna and channel",
    ", we can simply add @xmath64 to the first passage times for probe escape we compute using our model . as we shall see , at low to moderate membrane voltages this additional time is small compared to the time required to denature the probe dna .",
    "we use eqn [ eqn1 ] to compute the thermally averaged time for the dna probe to first reach the fully extracted state @xmath65 . to do this",
    ", we make the @xmath66 state completely absorbing , and slightly modify eqn [ eqn1 ] by setting @xmath67 for all @xmath17 :    @xmath68    note that the first term in eqn [ fpt0 ] does not include contributions from transitions out of state @xmath66 while the second term does include transitions into state @xmath66 . upon defining @xmath69 to be the probability that the system reaches the absorbing state between time @xmath17 and time @xmath70 , given that it started in state @xmath71 we find    @xmath72    with @xmath69 computed from the solution to eqn [ fpt0 ] , we can determine the mean first passage time to the extracted state    @xmath73    finally , to find the thermally averaged mean first passage time , @xmath3 , we sum the results of eqn [ fpt2 ] over all possible initial states of the probe dna ,    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the free energy of state @xmath8 relative to the free energy of the completely dehybridized system .",
    "the validity of eqn [ fpt3 ] is contingent on the assumption of local thermal equilibrium between the probe and the fluid bath .",
    "however , as the probe is typically maintained in the inserted state for several tenths of a second prior to removal @xcite , we expect this assumption to hold to reasonable accuracy .    ) . at low voltages , energetic effects account for the majority of the difference in escape times between the various defect - carrying strands .",
    "inset : thermally averaged mean escape times of a dna segment 5 bases long .",
    "each hybridized base lowers the free energy by @xmath76 , except for a single defect site ( located at position @xmath77 ) which lowers the free energy by @xmath78 when hybridized .",
    "placing the defect in the center of the segment lowers the mean escape time significantly more than placing a defect at either end of the segment.,width=316 ]    to investigate how nonhomologous defects influence the mean first passage time , we first analyze the process of dna extraction using a simple model where each non - defective hybridized base pair lowered the free energy of the probe - target complex by a constant amount . a single defective base pair with a binding free - energy lower than all other bases",
    "was then introduced into the target strand . as an example",
    ", we considered a short strand of eleven bases , and used the double zipper model to generate the mean escape time curves displayed in the inset of fig [ lifetime1 ] .",
    "there are two features worth noting ; the mean escape time clearly depends on the location of a defective base as well as the energy of the defect , and the position and energy of the defect influence the escape time less as the applied voltage is increased . at first glance",
    "the dependence of the escape time on defect location appears counter - intuitive given that the defect energy did not vary with the location of the defect along the target strand . nonetheless , the behavior displayed in fig .",
    "[ lifetime1 ] where a defect placed in the center of the dna strand produces maximal reduction in mean escape time , is extremely general and rather insensitive to changes in the parameter values of the model .    to understand the source of this effect , consider a dna chain with a defect at position @xmath77 , when the dna chain is in the @xmath79 or @xmath80 state with @xmath81 .",
    "if the defect is at site @xmath77 , the probability of the adjacent dna base rehybridizing goes as @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath83 is the rate at which the defect base dehybridizes , and @xmath84 is the rate of rehybridization of the base adjacent to the defect .",
    "the effect of introducing a defect is to increase @xmath83 while keeping @xmath84 constant , reducing the likelihood of hybridization of the adjacent base . in the case where the defect results in particularly weak binding ,",
    "the increase in @xmath83 can be quite large , making it highly unlikely that dna will rehybridize beyond the defect base @xmath77 once the defect itself has dehybridized .",
    "this shortens the effective length of the dna by @xmath85 sites .",
    "we note however that introducing bubbles into the model would minimize the variation in escape time with defect position . in the presence of bubbles ,",
    "bases well separated from the defect could rehybridize without the defect base itself rehybridizing .",
    "this would dramatically reduce the variation in the mean escape time associated with the defect position .",
    "nonetheless , the mean escape time of gc - rich strands which are relatively resistant to bubble formation may still be sensitive to the position of defects in the target strand .",
    ".dna target sequences @xcite along with the hybridization energies predicted by mfold ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the probe dna strand is perfectly complementary to the 14pc sequence .",
    "the difference in the free energies between the various defect strands is due to the presence of different defect nucleotides ( * a * vs * c * ) , and differences in the bases neighboring the defects . for more detail",
    "see @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     turning to a more realistic free energy model , we used the the mfold 2-state hybridization server @xcite to generate free energy surfaces for four distinct probe sequences , each 14 bases in length @xcite ( see table [ sequences ] ) .",
    "the form of the lifetime verses voltage behavior produced by eqn [ fpt3 ] for these sequences is displayed in fig .",
    "[ lifetime1 ] .",
    "the four voltage response curves clearly separate into two groups ; the 14pc sequence ( perfectly complementary to the dna probe ) and the 1a sequence ( with a single non - complementary base at the @xmath10 end of the sequence ) belong to a long lived set , while the 7c and 10c sequences ( both with a single non - complimentary base in the center of the sequence ) form a group with a dramatically shorter lifetime .",
    "we note that the approximately four orders of magnitude difference between the defect - free and 1a escape times and the 7c and 10c escape times at zero voltage , is consistent with the free energy differences between the various probes . from the standpoint of potential applications to dna sequencing ,",
    "the reduction in free energy produced by a defective base is clearly the dominant influence on the mean escape time .",
    "returning to the dna sequences used to produce fig [ lifetime1 ] , we investigated the consequences on the mean probe lifetime of varying the @xmath12 detachment rate , and found that this rate has a significantly greater influence on the mean escape time in the low voltage regime than in the high voltage regime .",
    "this leads us to propose that the field - induced dehybridization can occur through one of two mechanisms . in the low voltage regime , thermal denaturation of the target dna from the probe",
    "is the dominant mode of separation . in this region of the lifetime - voltage curve , thermally - induced dehybridization from the @xmath12 end is at least as significant as voltage driven - bond stripping at the @xmath10 end .",
    "as the applied voltage is increased , the system enters a transition region where voltage - driven bond stripping becomes the statistically favored mechanism of detachment .",
    "finally , in the high voltage region stripping becomes the primary means of separation .",
    "to confirm this hypothesis , we find the probability that base @xmath77 ( measured from the @xmath10 end of the probe dna ) , is the last base to dehybridize prior to extraction of the dna probe .",
    "we first define @xmath87 to be the probability density that the last dehybridization event occurs at base @xmath77 between time @xmath17 and @xmath70 . making use of the solution to eqn [ eqn1 ]",
    ", @xmath88 can be expressed as    @xmath89    here @xmath90 is the probability the probe dna is fully drawn into the channel by time @xmath91 given that it was fully dehybridized ( _ i.e. , _ in state @xmath92 ) at time @xmath17 , assuming that no rehybridization events occur between @xmath17 and @xmath91 . rates @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined by eqns [ bondbreakrate1 ] and [ bondbreakrate2 ] respectively .    since the probabilities produced by eqn [ eqn1 ] contain contributions from paths through the @xmath8 state space that include rehybridization events , we can not use the solution to eqn [ eqn1 ] to compute @xmath95 .",
    "however we can compute @xmath96 by considering the master equation governing the transitions between fully dehybridized states @xmath97 . defining @xmath98",
    "to be the probability of being in the @xmath99 state at time @xmath17 , given that the system was in state @xmath100 at time @xmath101 , we have    @xmath102       \\displaystyle \\frac{dw_{(i , n - i)}}{dt } & = & -(r_2^{(i ) } + r_1^{(i ) } + k_3^{(i ) } + k_4^{(i)})w_{(i , n - i ) } & \\\\[13pt ]       & & + k_3^{(i-1)}w_{(i-1,n-(i-1 ) ) } + k_4^{(i+1)}w_{(i+1,n-(i+1 ) ) } & \\\\[13pt ]       & & 0 < i < ( n-1 )   & \\\\[13pt ]       \\displaystyle \\frac{dw_{(n-1,1)}}{dt } & = & -(r_2^{(n-1 ) } + r_1^{(n-1 ) } + k_3^{(n-1 ) } + k_4^{(n-1)})w_{(n-1,1)}\\\\[13pt ]       \\displaystyle & & + k_3^{(n-2)}w_{(n-2,2)}. & \\\\[13pt ]    \\end{array }    \\label{auxmaster1}\\ ] ]    .",

    "the thermally averaged probability that base @xmath77 is the last to dehybridize is computed from    @xmath113    referring to the inset in fig [ bondbreak1 ] , we see that using the simple free energy model where each hybridized base lowers the free energy of the system by @xmath114 produces a @xmath115 that is symmetric about the mid - point of the dna lattice .",

    "the behavior of @xmath115 is also predictable , with the bases at the @xmath12 end of probe dna becoming more likely to be the last to separate .",

    "are obscured and a stripping mechanism dominates .",

    "we also note that the magnitude of eqn [ fprw4 ] depends strongly on the position of the defect in the dna sequence .",
    "as was the case in the two - dimensional model , the mean extraction time predicted by the one - dimensional model is a minimum when the defect is located in the middle of the target strand .",
    "as before , we ascribe this position dependence to a defect s ability to reduce the likelihood of rehybridization past the defect base pair , thus shortening the effective length of the probe - target complex .",

    "<S> additionally , we investigate the effects of introducing non - homologous defects into the dna strand . </S>"
