    "global and local symmetries of a physical system play an essential role in modern theoretical physics and its physical applications . apart from a well - known relation between symmetries and conserved charges via the noether theorem",
    ", the knowledge of a symmetry group of a certain theory is deeply built - in in its theoretical description and may lead to restrictive ` no - go ' theorems .",
    "introduction of new algebras is , in that sense , required by possible solutions to these theoretical problems in the hope that they could circumvent the ` no - go ' theorems .",
    "a beautiful example is the introduction of lie superalgebras that unify in a nontrivial way spacetime and internal symmetries of the microscopic world , not allowed in a purely bosonic context by the coleman - mandula theorem . in this way , the study of the relation between lie algebras and groups , and especially the derivation of new algebras from them , is a problem of great interest in mathematics and physics , because finding a new lie group from an already known one also means that a new physical theory can be obtained from a known one .",
    "this is particularly useful , for example , in gauge theories ( like yang - mills and chern - simons theories ) which have the symmetry group as a fundamental ingredient .",
    "thus , setting aside the trivial problem of finding whether a lie algebra is a subalgebra of another one , there are , essentially , three different ways of relating and/or obtaining new algebras from given ones .",
    "in fact , it was during the second half of the xx century that certain mechanisms were developed to obtain _ _ non - trivial _ _ relations between different lie groups and algebras .",
    "these mechanisms are known as _ contractions _",
    "@xcite , _ deformations _ @xcite and _ extensions _",
    "@xcite , which all share the property of maintaining the dimension of the original group or algebra .",
    "as we are going to see now , this work is focused on a generalization of the contraction procedure called _ expansion _ that , starting from a given algebra , permits us to generate algebras of a higher dimension than the original one .",
    "expansions of lie algebras are generalizations of the weimar - woods ( ww ) contraction method @xcite and were introduced some years ago in refs . @xcite . while in a contraction a suitable rescaling of some generators of the lie algebra",
    "is done , in the expansion method the starting point is to consider an algebra @xmath0 , with the basis of generators @xmath1 , as described by the maurer - cartan ( mc ) forms @xmath2 on the manifold @xmath3 of its associated group @xmath4 .",
    "as it is known , the local structure of the lie group is encoded in the so called maurer - cartan equations : @xmath5 which are just an equivalent description to the one given in terms of lie brackets among lie algebra generators , @xmath6   = c_{ij}^{k}\\,x_{k}$ ] .",
    "when a rescaling by a parameter @xmath7 is performed on some of the group coordinates @xmath8 , the forms @xmath9 can be expanded as power series in @xmath7 . inserting these expansions",
    "back in the original mc equations for @xmath0 , one obtains the mc equations of a new finite - dimensional expanded lie algebra . as shown in @xcite this method reproduces the inn - wigner contractions @xcite and its generalizations in the sense of weimar - woods @xcite . in these cases the dimension of the algebra is preserved but , in general , this expansion method also permits to obtain higher dimensional lie algebras .",
    "a generalization of the above method is the @xmath10-expansion  @xcite that combines the structure constants of the algebra @xmath0 with the inner law of an abelian semigroup @xmath10 in order to define the lie bracket of a new @xmath10-expanded algebra . when certain conditions are met , the method permits the extraction of smaller algebras which are called _ resonant subalgebras _ and _ reduced algebras_. this method reproduces the results of the first expansion method described above ( that uses a parameter @xmath7 ) for a particular choice of the semigroup : one of the semigroups denoted as @xmath11  and its definition is given in @xcite .",
    "since it reproduces the method above , it also reproduces all the generalized inn - wigner ( iw ) contractions , as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite explicitly - expansions exhaust all possible contractions since there exist contractions that are not realized by generalized iw - contractions @xcite .",
    "besides , there exist @xmath10-expansions which are not equivalent to contractions as it was recently shown in @xcite . ] .",
    "the present article is dedicated to a further development of the @xmath10-expansion method and its application to the theory of lie algebras .",
    "interesting physical applications of these methods , particularly of the @xmath10-expansion , appeared recently in the literature .",
    "one of the advantages , used in those applications , is that if we know the invariant tensors of a certain lie algebra then the mechanism gives the invariant tensors for the expanded algebras , even if the last ones are not semisimple .",
    "this feature is especially useful in the construction of transgressions and chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theories of ( super)gravity @xcite where the invariant tensors of the symmetry group under which the theory is invariant are fundamental ingredients of the theory .",
    "on one side , the problem of finding all the invariant tensors for a non - semisimple lie algebra remains as an open problem until know .",
    "but this is not only an important mathematical problem but also one with physical relevance , because given an algebra the choice of the invariant tensor fixes the classes of interactions that may occur between the different fields in the theory .",
    "in fact , the standard procedure to obtain an invariant tensor of range @xmath12 is to use the symmetrized ( super)trace for the product of @xmath12 generators in some matrix representation of the algebra .",
    "however this procedure has some limitations in the case of non - semisimple lie algebras .",
    "a concrete example is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite where an eleven - dimensional gauge theory for the m algebra ( the maximal supersymmetric extension of the poincar algebra in @xmath13-dimensions ) is constructed .",
    "it is shown that the supertrace is not a good choice to construct the theory , because it has so many vanish components that a transgression or a cs lagrangian constructed from it depends only on the spin connection and it represents therefore a kind of _ exotic gravity_. therefore with the supertrace as an invariant tensor it is not possible to reproduce general relativity neither to include fermionic fields or fields associated to central charges . however , by using the @xmath10-expansion procedure it is possible to consider the m algebra as an expansion of the @xmath14 algebra providing an invariant tensor , different from the supertrace , which leads to a theory with a richer structure .",
    "it is worthy to note here that while the @xmath10-expansion method does not solve the problem of classifying all invariant tensors for non semisimple algebras , at least it gives invariant tensors different from the supertrace that are useful for the construction of the mentioned gauge theories of gravity .",
    "a dual formulation of the s - expansion procedure for lie algebra was also constructed in @xcite , which permits to understand this procedure at the level of the lagrangians .",
    "another interesting application of the expansion methods consists in establishing a relation between general relativity and cs gravity @xcite . as shown in @xcite , general relativity in five - dimensional spacetime may emerge at a special critical point from a cs action . to achieve this result ,",
    "both the lie algebra ( called the @xmath15 algebra ) and the symmetric invariant tensor that defines the cs lagrangian are constructed by means of the lie algebra s - expansion method with the semigroup @xmath16 .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that a black hole @xcite and a cosmological solution @xcite have also been constructed for the cs theory constructed in terms of this expanded @xmath15 algebra .    on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath10-expansion method was extended to the case of _ higher - order lie algebras _",
    "these kinds of algebras , defined in terms of a multilinear antisymmetric product , are a particular case of the so - called _ strongly homotopy lie algebras _",
    "@xcite , which in turn are related to the structure of higher spin interactions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath10-expansion method was also extended to study the expansion of loop algebras , which are infinite dimensional and can be useful in applications related to higher spin ( hs ) theories as , for example , in the vasiliev formulation thereof @xcite . finally , a procedure that permit us to contruct casimir operators for the expanded algebra was recently found in @xcite .",
    "therefore , as many physical applications appearing in the literature depend on the possibility of relating two given algebras by some contraction or expansion procedure , an exhaustive study of the general properties of this method is needed to deeply understand their consequences in physical theories .",
    "in fact , a feature that almost all those physical applications have in common is that they depend on the following question : _ given two symmetry algebras , can they be related by means of some contraction or expansion procedure ?",
    "_ here we attempt to give the first steps to answer the above question - expansion method because it reproduces the other expansion methods for a particular choice of the semigroup ( the semigroups @xmath11  mentioned before ) . ] . by studying the preserved properties of the algebras under expansions we find certain theorems that can be used as criteria and , more specifically , as necessary conditions to solve this problem .",
    "then the relation might still exist or do not .",
    "the second part of the process , which consists in finding the relation explicitly with help of computer programs , is not presented here but mainly developed in @xcite . in order to check our theoretical results ,",
    "examples are provided by performing all the possible expansions that can be made for @xmath17 with semigroups up to and including order @xmath18 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ desc ] , we present a brief technical description of the basic ingredients that we are going to use . in section",
    "[ preserved ] , we study under which conditions properties like solvability , nilpotency , semisimplicity and compactness are preseved under @xmath10-expansions on each level of the procedure .",
    "particularly , in section [ cartandec ] , we review some aspects of the cartan decomposition of the expanded algebra when compactness is preserved . in section [ sl2 ]",
    "we make an exhaustive study of the possible expansions that can be made for the algebra @xmath19 and check our theoretical results . in section [ sclassification ] it is shown that a classification of semigroups in terms of the eigenvalues of certain matrices , that are related to intrinsic properties of the semigroup , is a useful tool to predict semisimplicity and compactness properties for the expanded algebras .",
    "section [ resum ] is a summary of the results and finally , in section [ com ] , some comments about future applications are given .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the general abelian semigroup expansion procedure ( @xmath10-expansion for short ) .",

    "then the mapping @xmath458 of an arbitrary element @xmath472 can be expressed in terms of @xmath219 as follows:@xmath473 then it is straightforward to show that @xmath458 is a conjugation of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath241 , i.e. , that also satisfies @xmath474   = \\left [   \\sigma_{s}\\left (   b_{1}\\right ) , \\sigma_{s}\\left (   b_{2}\\right )   \\right ]   \\text { \\   } \\forall b_{1},b_{2}\\in \\mathcal{g}_{s}\\text { \\ \\ and \\ } \\left (   \\sigma_{s}\\right )   ^{2}=i\\text{.}\\ ] ]    now let us prove ( [ cd1 ] ) , i.e. , that @xmath249 is invariant under the conjugation ( [ cd4 ] ) .",
    "in fact , consider the action of @xmath475 on an abitrary element @xmath476:@xmath477 where we have used ( [ cd4_1 ] ) and @xmath478 . in this way ( [ cd1 ] )",

    "<S> the study of the relation between lie algebras and groups , and especially the derivation of new algebras from them , is a problem of great interest in mathematics and physics , because finding a new lie group from an already known one also means that a new physical theory can be obtained from a known one . </S>",
    "<S> one of the procedures that allow to do so is called expansion of lie algebras , and has been recently used in different physical applications - particularly in gauge theories of gravity . here </S>",
    "<S> we report on further developments of this method , required to understand in a deeper way their consequences in physical theories . </S>",
    "<S> we have found theorems related to the preservation of some properties of the algebras under expansions that can be used as criteria and , more specifically , as necessary conditions to know if two arbitrary lie algebras can be related by the some expansion mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> formal aspects , such as the cartan decomposition of the expanded algebras , are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an instructive example that allows to check explicitly all our theoretical results is also provided . </S>"
