    "among @xmath6200 known low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , sax  j1808.4@xmath03658  ( hereafter j1808.4 ) stands out because not only was it the first discovered accretion - powered millisecond pulsar ( apmp ) system @xcite , but also this transient system is relatively bright during quiescence and has relatively frequent outbursts , allowing detailed studies of its various properties ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one intriguing property of the system is the fact that the millisecond pulsar possibly switches its energy source from accretion during outbursts to rotation during quiescence .",
    "this possible property is indicated by bright , large - amplitude optical modulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) seen in the binary during quiescence , which can not be caused by x - ray heating of the inner face of the companion star . the quiescent x - ray luminosity @xmath7 ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 ; @xcite ) is two orders of magnitude lower than that required @xcite . instead",
    ", if one considers that the neutron star in the binary turns on as a radio pulsar in quiescence , its rotational energy output ( so - called spin - down luminosity ) @xmath10 is @xmath11 erg s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this energy output would presumably be in the form of a pulsar wind and sufficient to illuminate the inner face of the companion star . among",
    "over a dozen known apmp binaries @xcite , two other systems , igr  j00291@xmath125934 and xte  j1814@xmath0338 , were also found to have similar optical modulations that can not be explained by x - ray heating ( @xcite ; however for the first source , see also @xcite ) , suggesting that apmps in these systems might commonly switch to be radio pulsars during quiescence .    to fully examine the possibility in j1808.4 , deloye et al .",
    "( 2008 ; see also @xcite ) have observed j1808.4  simultaneously at x - ray and optical energies , and from the observations they have confirmed the inconsistency between the large - amplitude optical modulation and low x - ray luminosity . applying a phase - coherent timing technique , @xcite have accurately determined the period and phase of the optical modulation and concluded that the optical periodicity is highly consistent with the x - ray orbital ephemeris ( derived from pulsar timing ; @xcite ) .",
    "their results have excluded other possible origins ( such as the accretion disk ) and established that the modulation does arise from the companion star .    following these studies",
    ", it should be interesting to compare the modulations between outburst and quiescence since presumably the former is caused by x - ray heating , and the latter by pulsar wind heating . when j1808.4   was reported to have its expected outburst @xcite at the end of 2008 september @xcite , we organized optical observations of the source and obtained its light curves during the outburst . in this paper",
    ", we report on the results from the observations .",
    "in addition , @xcite have shown that by fitting the quiescent optical modulation in j1808.4  with an advanced binary light curve model , in which lights from an accretion disk and an irradiated donor are considered , important constraints on the binary system ( such as the inclination and neutron star s mass ) can be derived .",
    "their work also concluded that in order to obtain better parameter constraints for this system , simultaneous multi - band light curves would be needed . using data newly obtained as well as those reported in @xcite and @xcite , we have conducted fitting to the modulation .",
    "we used the binary light curve code icarus @xcite , that is similar to the elc program @xcite used by @xcite .",
    "we also employed a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique that allows for simultaneously fitting the multi - dimensional light curve model to the data and identifies the best - fit parameters as well as their confidence intervals .",
    "we describe the previous light curve data , our time - resolved photometry of j1808.4  in 2008 , and related data reduction in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "we provide details of our binary light curve model and mcmc fitting of the obtained light curves , and fitting results in   [ sec : fit ] . timing analysis of all the quiescent light curves and analysis of broad - band disk spectra obtained from our fitting are given in ",

    "two sets of light curve data obtained from previous gemini imaging observations were included in this work .",
    "the observations for the first and second set were carried out in 2007 march and 2008 may , and were reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the first set mainly contains two @xmath13 light curves , one 2.5 hour long and the other 2.8 hour long , while two additional @xmath14 brightness data points were obtained at the end of each @xmath13 light curve .",
    "the second set contains three 3  hour @xmath15 light curves obtained over 5 days .",
    "detailed descriptions of the datasets can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "time - resolved imaging of j1808.4  was carried out with gemini south telescope on 2008 august 4 and 7 . to obtain nearly simultaneous multi - band light curves ,",
    "sloan @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters were alternately used for imaging in each night .",
    "the detector was the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ; @xcite ) , which consists of three 2048@xmath164608 eev ccds . in our observations ,",
    "only a section of 300@xmath16300 pixel@xmath17 in the middle ccd ( ccd 02 ) was used .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.073/pixel .",
    "the total observation time in the first night was 3 hours , with 23 and 24 useful @xmath13 and @xmath14 images respectively made .",
    "the exposure times were 200.5  s in @xmath13 and 150.5  s in @xmath14 .",
    "the observing conditions were variable , with the seeing [ full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the point spread function ( psf ) of the images ] increasing from 0.6  to 0.9  over the course of the observation . on august 7 ,",
    "the total observation time was 5.5 hours , during which 47 and 48 useful @xmath13 and @xmath14 images , respectively , were made .",
    "the exposure time at each band was the same as that in the first night .",
    "the observing conditions were relatively stable , with the average seeing being @xmath180.7 .",
    "the starting of the 2008 outburst of j1808.4  was reported by @xcite on 2008 september 22 .",
    "we subsequently requested cfht target - of - opportunity observations of the source .",
    "the observations were carried out in the queued service observing mode on 2008 september 29 , 30 , october 3 , and 4 .",
    "the detector was the wide - field imager megacam , which consists of 36 2048@xmath164612 pixel@xmath17 ccds .",
    "the field of our target was imaged on ccd 22 .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.187/pixel .",
    "a sloan @xmath15 filter was used for imaging .    during the four nights",
    ", we obtained 60 , 63 , 84 , and 72 images , respectively .",
    "the exposure time for each image was 20  s. the total observation times were 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.6 , and 1.4 hours , respectively .",
    "the observing conditions in the first night were good , with an average seeing of 0.8 . in the second night , the seeing condition was not good , having a large range of 0.81.8  and an average of 1.1 .",
    "therefore 6 images with large seeing values were excluded from the data .",
    "the third night had good observing conditions , with an average seeing of 0.7 .",
    "the observing conditions in the fourth night were relatively variable , with the seeing in a range of 0.61.2and an average of 0.8 .",
    "we used the iraf packages for data reduction .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "we performed psf - fitting photometry to measure the brightnesses of the source and other in - field stars .",
    "a photometry program dophot @xcite was used .        before photometry",
    ", we positionally calibrated our gemini images ( made during the quiescent state ) to reduce possible contamination from the two nearby stars , since the two stars had similar brightnesses and were 0.6   and 1.0  away from the target ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we first made a reference image by combining three best - quality @xmath14 images on august 7 .",
    "all gemini images were then calibrated to this reference image .",
    "we determined the positions of our target and the two nearby stars in the reference image and fixed them at these positions for photometry of the gemini images .",
    "differential photometry was performed to eliminate systematic flux variations in the images .",
    "six isolated , non - variable bright stars in the field were used .",
    "the brightnesses of our targets and other stars in each frame were calculated relative to the total counts of the six stars .",
    "standard stars 95 - 100 and 95 - 96 @xcite were observed on august 4 and used for @xmath13 and @xmath14 flux calibration , respectively .",
    "to convert @xcite vega magnitudes of the standard stars to sloan filter magnitudes , transformation equations given by @xcite were used .    for cfht data ,",
    "because j1808.4  was in outburst , approximately 30 times brighter than in quiescence , and the exposure time was short , no effort was made to separate the two nearby stars from our target .",
    "differential photometry was also performed , with 10 in - field bright stars used for calibrating out systematic flux variations among the images .",
    "no standard stars were requested in our cfht program . using 8 in - field bright stars , we flux calibrated our @xmath15 images to those in @xcite .",
    "the obtained gemini and cfht light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lcgi ] and figure  [ fig : lcr ] , respectively .",
    "we note that during our gemini observations , the source was brightening . over two days ,",
    "the source s @xmath13 and @xmath14 brightnesses changed by 1.3 and 0.9 mag , respectively . in addition , the amplitudes of modulation decreased from @xmath180.4 mag to @xmath180.2 mag .    at the time of the outburst ,",
    "j1808.4  was visible to cfht for only approximately one hour . therefore each cfht light curve covered half of the binary orbit .",
    "it can be seen that the first two light curves are sinusoidal - like with an amplitude of 0.2 mag , similar to those seen in quiescence .",
    "the latter two light curves changed to a smaller amplitude of 0.1 mag , and the average source brightness at the time decreased by approximately 0.3 mag .",
    "we fitted the data using the icarus light curve model for irradiated companions in binaries @xcite .",
    "the model was adapted from the code developed by van  kerkwijk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been recently used for two other systems @xcite .",
    "the model is similar to the elc program @xcite that was employed by @xcite for their earlier work on j1808.4 .    in this model ,",
    "the surface of the companion is constructed by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for a rotating body , which in our case was tidally locked to the neutron star .",
    "we implemented a new stellar grid parametrization that uses a triangle tessellation obtained from the subdivision of the primitives of an isocahedron .",
    "this parametrization yields uniform coverage on the projected sphere surrounding the star and allows for better performance of the code . we scaled the star so that its size matches that of the roche lobe , which is justified from the fact that j1808.4  regularly undergoes outbursts involving mass transfer from the companion .",
    "a base temperature for the companion is chosen and effects of gravity darkening accounted using lucy s law @xcite , with a power - law index of 0.08 . to this , we apply the irradiative flux from the neutron star in the way prescribed by @xcite . finally , we integrated over the visible surface the emerging flux in a selected photometric filter , which was interpolated from btsettl atmosphere models @xcite , in order to obtain the total flux at a given orbital phase and for specific orbital parameters .",
    "we approximated the disk contribution by adding an orbital - independent , constant value to the companion s flux .",
    "the disk flux values inferred at different photometric bands at one epoch constitute a spectral energy distribution , which were checked for consistency with arising from an accretion disk (   [ subsec : disk ] ) .",
    "we also made the implicit presumption that the system is seen sufficiently face - on so that there is no mutual eclipse / shadow arising between the disk and the companion .",
    "this presumption is motivated by the fact that light curves of j1808.4  in quiescence are symmetrical and do not show obvious signs of flux changes that could result from the interaction between the two components @xcite . moreover , the estimated orbital inclination from previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) as well as that inferred from this work ( see   [ subsec : results]the maximum value we found is only 56 ) indicates that the companion is unlikely to be obscured by the disk for any reasonable disk scale height .",
    "we used a bayesian framework to make statistical inferences on our light curve modeling parameters .",
    "the bayesian inference on a set of parameters @xmath19 is obtained from their posterior probability , which is conditional to the prior knowledge , @xmath20 , that we have of these parameters and the experimental data @xmath21 .",
    "the posterior probability can be written as the product of the priors times the likelihood of the data : @xmath22 , where the denominator is a normalization factor to ensure that the posterior probability integrated over the parameter space is unity [ see @xcite for an introduction to bayesian analysis ] .",
    "the x - ray timing of j1808.4  already provides accurate measurements of its orbital period and the projected semi - major axis of the neutron star . in order to fully parametrize the system ( e.g. masses , separation , etc . ) , two additional quantities are required .",
    "we chose the orbital inclination , @xmath2 , and the projected radial velocity semi - amplitude of the companion @xmath23 , because of their close connection to observables .",
    "for the orbital inclination , @xcite found a relatively large range of 3667  ( 1@xmath5 ) from their fitting . since a subset of the data used in our analysis included the data set from deloye et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we chose the priors to be flat in @xmath24 to fully search for the best - fit range in this work .    the use of spectroscopic observations to constrain the companion s radial velocity is made quite difficult due to its faintness in quiescence .",
    "while the system does get much brighter during outbursts , its emission mainly contains features arising from the accretion disk . using spectra obtained in the 2008 outburst and analyzing doppler images of the @xmath25 emission line associated to the bowen blend , @xcite and @xcite both tracked the motion of the companion in j1808.4 . because the latter analyzed a total of 39 spectra , which included 16 spectra that were analyzed and reported by the former , we considered the result given by the latter , @xmath26kms@xmath9 , and reported our fitting results based on this measurement .",
    "we discussed the influence of the different @xmath27 measurements to our fitting in ",
    "[ subsec : d1 ] by also considering the value obtained by @xcite , @xmath28kms@xmath9 .",
    "however only unreasonably low - mass values for the neutron star were found from our fitting when the value of @xcite was used .",
    "the average location of the bowen emission is indicated by @xmath27 , which is essentially produced on the irradiated hemisphere of the star and has a different velocity from that of the center of mass , @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite discussed the `` k - correction '' factor required to convert the bowen velocity to the center of mass and estimated that @xmath29kms@xmath9 , based on modeling by @xcite .",
    "we included the @xmath27 constraint as a gaussian prior in our bayesian inference .",
    "for every realization of the model , we determined the velocity of the companion s light center by calculating the average velocity over the visible surface , weighted by the flux contribution of each surface element .",
    "since the irradiated side of the companion is much hotter than that of the back side ( 6000k vs. 3000k , respectively ) , the flux contribution from the non - irradiated side in the @xmath13-band becomes negligible and the inferred velocity should be a good approximation of @xmath27 . as expected from @xcite , we found that @xmath30kms@xmath9 is required to satisfy the velocity constraint .",
    "such value is also consistent with the semi - analytical k - correction relationship derived by @xcite for the companion to psr  b1957 + 20 , which shares similarities to j1808.4 . from analytical and numerical modeling of this irradiated companion",
    ", they determined that the ratio of the observed projected light - center velocity to the projected center - of - mass velocity follows @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radius of the nose of the companion in units of separation to the system s barycenter , and @xmath33 , a parameter relatively independent of the system and companion properties such of orbital inclination , filling factor , and surface temperature as long as the companion is strongly irradiated and nearly fills its roche lobe .",
    "hence , for j1808.4  @xmath34 which , again , implies a measurable velocity comparable to the above value .",
    "the base temperature of the companion was fixed using a temperature - mass relationship for low - mass brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the temperature , as a function of mass alone , ranges between 20003000 k. from the photometric colors near the inferior conjunction of the companion , we confirmed that the temperature is consistent with the range .",
    "in addition , keeping it a free parameter did not improve the light curve fits significantly .",
    "we used flat priors for the companion s day - side temperature since its surface albedo is uncertain as well as the amount of incident energy approximated by the pulsar s spin - down energy .",
    "although it is unlikely , we tested modeling the whole dataset with a constant day - side temperature .",
    "we found such a setting did not result in good fits .",
    "a separate day - side temperature for each observation was used in order to account for variability .      using several different methods",
    ", @xcite estimated the distance @xmath35 to j1808.4 .",
    "first by setting the time - averaged x - ray flux equal to the expected mass transfer rate from gravitational radiation , they found a low limit of @xmath36  kpc .",
    "they also modelled the type i x - ray bursts that all showed photospheric radius expansion during the 2002 october outburst of j1808.4 , and obtained a distance range of @xmath37kpc .",
    "finally considering the peak flux of the radius expansion bursts as a standard candle , @xmath38  kpc was estimated for a pure helium atmosphere or @xmath39  kpc from an empirical value of @xcite .",
    "we set a gaussian prior on the distance modulus @xmath40 , where a 7% uncertainty was chosen in order to compensate for possible uncertainties in the distance estimates ( see @xcite for details ) .    for the reddening",
    ", we also chose a gaussian prior and set the @xmath41 band absorption to @xmath42 using the value derived from @xcite .      the same as for the day - side temperature",
    ", we used an independent disk flux value with a flat prior for each set of continuous observation , as well as each photometric band .",
    "we designed our light curve fitting algorithm to optimize the disk flux value every time the companion parameters were changed . since the disk contribution is an additive , linear problem in the flux system",
    " and therefore a very simple non - linear problem in the magnitude system  solving for the best disk flux comes to the cost of only a few additional cpu cycles compared to the lengthier optimization of the companion parameters .        in the 2008 august 7 observation ( figure  [ fig : lcgi ] )",
    ", a noticeable rise in the overall flux level is visible and likely indicates that j1808.4  was coming out of quiescence .",
    "clearly , a constant flux value can not account for this change and we allowed for a small linear variation of the disk contribution over the course of the observation .      in order to account for intrinsic short - term flux variations that sometimes could significantly deviate away from the sinusoidal - like orbital modulation of j1808.4   ( @xcite ; see also ",
    "[ subsec : orb ] ) , we added a ` noise parameter ' to the uncertainties of our data .",
    "the uncertainty of a flux datum @xmath2 in dataset @xmath43 becomes @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the new and old uncertainties , respectively , and @xmath47 is the noise parameter .",
    "this technique is commonly used in bayesian analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and has an effect loosly similar to that of uncertainties rescaling which is performed in frequentist analysis to obtain a reduced @xmath48 .",
    "the priors are chosen to be logarithmic ( i.e. jeffrey s priors ) in order to provide equal weighting per decade since the noise term is a scaling parameter .",
    "the light curve fitting is a multi - dimensional nonlinear optimization problem that we tackled using an mcmc method @xcite .",
    "this is particularly efficient to make bayesian inference since the full posterior distribution is evaluated . in the limit that the observed magnitude errors are normally distributed",
    ", the likelihood function can be written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the conventional chi - square .",
    "for the mcmc , we chose the _ stretch move _ algorithm that is part of a family of mcmc methods called _ ensemble samplers with affine invariance _ described by @xcite . in a nutshell",
    ", the algorithm is executed by simultaneously running several chains , all initialized at random locations of the parameter phase space .",
    "every step of the mcmc , a move is proposed for each chain by choosing a complementary chain at random and drawing point along a line passing through the last position recorded in the two chains .",
    "how big a step away from the previous position is determined using a distribution which is affine invariant [ i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "the proposed move is accepted with a probability that is slightly different than that of the usual metropolis algorithm in order to satisfy the detailed balance requirement [ see @xcite for the details ] .",
    "an advantage of the stretch move algorithm is that the acceptance rate , which controls the efficiency of the chain , can be tuned using a single parameter in the proposal distribution , as opposed to one per dimension for a random walk metropolis algorithm .",
    "it should also perform better for highly skewed and badly scaled distributions .",
    "we ran the stretch move algorithm using 30 simultaneous chains for a total of @xmath52 steps each .",
    "the proposal distribution s tuning parameter was determined from a previous trial run and the obtained acceptance rates of the chains were found to be in the range @xmath53 , as prescribed by @xcite . for subsequent analysis , we discarded the first @xmath54 points ( e.g. , the burn - in period ) and thinned the remaining by keeping every other 50 points in order to reduce the auto - correlation . in order to ensure that our mcmc has converged we visually inspected the trace of the parameters and performed the geweke test @xcite by comparing the mean of 10%-subsections of the first half of the chain to the remaining second half .",
    "we originally aimed to compare the modulations in quiescence and outburst by fitting the light curves separately .",
    "however the combination of the short light curves during the outburst and their relatively large uncertainties does not provide tight constraints .",
    "we also tested fitting all data together , but for the same reason the results were hardly changed compared to those including the quiescent data only .",
    "we therefore fit all the quiescent data obtained from 2007 march to 2008 august with our model . in table",
    "[ tab : res ] , we provide a summary of the fit results as well as several additional quantities inferred from the marginalized posterior probabilities of our irradiated companion modeling .",
    "the one and two - dimensional posteriors are displayed in figure [ fig : mcmc ] .",
    "we show all folded light curve data points , model light curves of the median parameter values , and residuals in figure  [ fig : fits ] .",
    "as can be seen , our model generally reproduces the observations quite well with the data points evenly distributed along the model light curves .",
    "however it can be noted that a few light curves have relatively large variations around our model fits , which are also reflected by the noise parameter values .",
    "these variations , noted in previous studies @xcite , were likely intrinsic and stochastic and can not be described by our current model .        our inferred orbital inclination , @xmath55 deg , is consistent with previous estimates from @xcite and @xcite ( the latter found @xmath56 deg by relativistic fe line fitting ; see also @xcite ) despite the day - to - day disk and irradiated - side temperature variability , which probably impair our ability to combine multi - epoch data obtained in different bands .",
    "consequently we constrained the neutron star and companion to have masses of 0.97@xmath57 and 0.04@xmath58 , respectively .",
    "our fitting has narrowed the possible mass ranges for both the neutron star and companion and points to a low - mass neutron star in j1808.4 , while we note with caution that the 3@xmath5 range for the mass of the neutron star is still wide , 0.472.52 @xmath59 ( table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "in addition , we note that our measurement of @xmath60 is in agreement with the independent estimate of @xmath61 from x - ray pulse shape modeling ( @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the distance modulus and extinction , dm=13.08@xmath620.11 and @xmath63 , are slightly larger than the previous estimates .",
    "the posteriors are very close to being normally distributed , and have standard deviations nearly the same as that of the priors .",
    "our inferred companion s projected radial velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath64kms@xmath9 , is in agreement with the value , @xmath65kms@xmath9 , from @xcite .",
    "we observed that the uncertainty on @xmath23 is only 50% as large as that of the priors , which implies that the data contribute to constraining the companion s velocity .",
    "the most likely reason is that given the distance and absorption are relatively well - determined , and the fact that the companion fills its roche lobe , the observed luminosity constrains the actual radius of the companion which is tied up to its orbital velocity .",
    "the day - side temperatures of the companion are consistent with being a constant before the 2008 outburst ( figure [ fig : temp ] ) , and we found that a temperature of 7972@xmath62243  k best fits them ( @xmath66 for 6 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that the data points may suggest a trend of temperature decreasing over the time , but no conclusion can be drawn due to the large standard deviations .",
    "our result is relatively surprising as one might have naively expected increased activity as the system was going towards an outburst .",
    "the behavior of the disk flux contribution ( figure [ fig : disk ] ) is also consistent with being constant in each band over time , except for the last observation ( on 2008 aug 7 ) in which the flux increased by a factor @xmath67 within 3 days .",
    "detailed analysis of the disk components is given below in   [ subsec : disk ] .",
    "previously by fitting the first two sets of data ( obtained on 2007 march 8 and 10 ; table  1 ) , @xcite found @xmath68 , which favoured a high - mass neutron star in j1808.4 .",
    "our results are drastically different , now pointing to a light , @xmath69 neutron star .",
    "in addition to the constraint on the companion s radial velocity from the @xmath27 measurements ( see also the discussion in ",
    "[ subsec : d1 ] ) , the causes of the difference can be understood from the following .",
    "nearly simultaneous multi - band light curves are crucial in order to break parameter degeneracies and , for instance , tell the stellar temperature apart from the orbital inclination @xcite , while @xcite had very limited multi - band information of the binary ( see   [ sec : pobs ] ) .",
    "the other important aspect is that the disk contribution acts as a dc component on an observed light curve and is almost completely degenerate with the orbital inclination .",
    "however , we were able to disentangle the orbital inclination from the disk in our data since the contribution from the latter varies over time whereas the orbital inclination remains constant . finally our mcmc fitting allowed to efficiently explore the entire parameter space whereas @xcite restricted their fitting to well - defined regions with a coarse grid .",
    "because of the reasons given above , we studied the outburst light curves by fitting them with all parameters of the binary system fixed at the median parameter values obtained from our fitting to the quiescent data ( table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "the free parameters were only the day - side temperature of the companion and disk flux .",
    "in addition , to have sufficient constraints , the last two sets of the data were assumed to have one day - side temperature value ( the average magnitudes of the source in the two days do not have a significant change ) .",
    "our model generally fits the observed light curves , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lcr ] , which shows the model light curves as well as residuals of the observed data points from them . from fitting",
    ", we found that the day - side temperature was in a range of 12,00025,000 k and disk flux approximately 2030 times larger than those in quiescence .",
    "these results are also given in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "a test to use the fitting results from the quiescent data as priors was conducted , and consistent results were obtained .",
    "we note that while the overall shape of the modulations in the outburst is in general consistent with our model of an irradiated companion star , there are fine structures in the outburst light curves .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lcr ] , the second light curve is sinusoidal - like , but it appears to deviate systematically in the middle part from our model .",
    "in addition , the data points in the third and fourth ones are not accurately represented and the third one shows a second minor peak after the main peak .",
    "we conclude that minor modulation variations were detected in the outburst .",
    "it has been shown that the orbital periodicity of j1808.4  can be determined from time - resolved photometry with a phase - coherent timing technique @xcite . using three observations made in 5 days ,",
    "@xcite have found an uncertainty of 2.8  s on the orbital period @xmath70 . with this uncertainty , it can be inferred that such timing observations within a maximum time span of 3.6 month are needed in order to avoid losing track of the optical periodicity phase .",
    "because our gemini observations in 2008 august satisfies this requirement , which further improves the accuracy of the period measurement , we attempted to phase connect all our light curves obtained during the quiescent state .",
    "the orbital period of j1808.4  has been found to increase at a rate of 1.2@xmath71 s yr@xmath9 from pulsar timing @xcite , and this large value , which is not well understood because it is an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by standard theoretical calculations for such a binary ( however see @xcite ) , might be confirmed from optical observations .",
    "since the modulation was variable over different bands and times of the observations ( figure  [ fig : fits ] ) , we fit each set / band of the light curves individually with a sinusoidal function @xmath72 $ ] ( where @xmath73 is time , @xmath74 the starting phase , and @xmath70 is the orbital period fixed at 7249.157 s ) , subtracted the obtained constant magnitude @xmath75 from them , and normalized them with the obtained semi - amplitudes @xmath76 .",
    "the uncertainties resulting from this normalization were added in quadrature to the original uncertainties of the magnitudes .",
    "the normalized light curves were then fit with a single sinusoid again , and we found that the best - fit has an orbital period @xmath77  s , while @xmath78 for 331 degrees of freedom .",
    "the large @xmath50 value reflects systematic uncertainties resulting from photometry , intrinsic scattering of the data points from a single sinusoid @xcite , and probably errors from normalizing short light curves . in figure",
    "[ fig : sin ] , the folded light curve , best - fit sinusoid , and residuals to the sinusoid are shown .",
    "a few data points deviating more than 3@xmath5 from the sinusoid are marked by squares .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties by scaling them by @xmath79 and obtained @xmath80  s and @xmath81 at mjd 54599.0 ( tdb ) , where phase @xmath82 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsar orbit .",
    "these results are consistent with that obtained from pulsar timing @xcite within the uncertainties . since the measurement accuracy of a period is generally proportional to the length of the time span , it is unlikely to be able to measure the orbit change rate via long - term optical photometry of the source .",
    "the accretion disk components resulting from our mcmc fitting are shown as a function of wavelengths in figure  [ fig : diskspec ] .",
    "the data points before the onset of the brightening on 2008 aug .",
    "7 can be reproduced by a simple accretion disk model , whose structure in quiescence is known to be different from that of the standard , steady - state disk model ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in both states",
    "the temperature profile can be described by an exponential function , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is disk radius , but the former is usually flatter than the latter ( @xmath85 is the standard value for the latter case ) .",
    "we fit the quiescent data points with the temperature profile .",
    "free parameters were disk temperature at @xmath86  cm , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "source distance , reddening , and inclination angle were fixed at the median values found from our mcmc fitting , and the inner and outer edges of the disk were assumed to be at the light cylinder of the pulsar ( @xmath89 cm ) and 90% of the roche - lobe radius of the pulsar ( @xmath90 cm ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "we found that @xmath91  k and @xmath92 provide the best - fit ( the minimum @xmath93 for 7 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the small @xmath50 value reflects the large standard deviations of the data points .",
    "the spectrum of the best - fit disk model is shown as the solid curve in figure  [ fig : diskspec ] .",
    "the data points on aug .",
    "7 are 24 times brighter than those obtained three days earlier , indicating the onset of the disk brightening .",
    "in addition , there is possibly a spectral change from rising to falling although we have only two data points and their standard deviations are too large for such a conclusion to be drawn .",
    "for example if @xmath94 is fixed ( the same as that obtained above in quiescence ) , the disk model with @xmath95  k provides a best fit ( the minimum @xmath96 for 1 degree of freedom ) , which is plotted as the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : diskspec ] . for a comparison , a steeper profile such as @xmath97 ( @xmath98  k )",
    "is also plotted ( the dashed curve ) in the figure .",
    "we note that the brightness at the time ( average @xmath99 ) was approximately 7 times lower than that at the outburst peak ( average @xmath100 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is of great interest to study how the disk evolved during the one and a half month period from aug 7 to september 22 directly preceding the reported x - ray outburst detection . since j1808.4  is known to have an outburst every 3 yrs @xcite , a close monitoring of the source before an outburst might help us learn the disk evolution over such a period .",
    "since the orbital period @xmath70 and the projected semi - major axis of the j1808.4  pulsar have been accurately measured from x - ray timing @xcite , the semi - amplitude of the pulsar s projected velocity @xmath101 is known . combining with it ,",
    "the @xmath23 measurement from optical spectroscopy provides a strong constraint on properties of the binary , particularly the neutron star s mass @xmath60 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the gravitational constant .",
    "if @xmath23 is known , @xmath60 is determined only by the orbital inclination @xmath2 ( similar discussions were also given by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath60@xmath2 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : mns ] , with 68% and 99.7% confidence - level regions resulting from our fitting ( low left panel in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] ) over - plotted . as can be seen ,",
    "our fitting results are consistent with the analytical expectations .",
    "if @xmath10423 km  s@xmath9 instead , as reported by @xcite , the @xmath60@xmath2 relation is expected to shift toward lower values .",
    "we explored this effect by fitting our model using @xmath105 km  s@xmath9 ( @xcite ) as a prior .",
    "as expected , we found similar results but noticeably @xmath106 and @xmath107  @xmath59 ( both uncertainties are 1@xmath5 ) , which are both smaller than the values obtained using the elebert et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measurement as the prior .",
    "the neutron star now has an unrealistically low mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : mns ] , we show the obtained @xmath60@xmath2 regions from our fitting in detail . as a result of the change of @xmath27 to the smaller value , the regions are shifted accordingly , but only the upper corner of the 3@xmath5 region allows @xmath108  @xmath59 neutron star mass .",
    "this suggests that their measurement is in general too low to provide a realistic mass range for the neutron star .",
    "on the basis of the current @xmath23 measurements , @xmath109 km  s@xmath9 , since the k - correction factor is derived assuming that @xmath27 indicated the orbital motion of the @xmath110 point .",
    "therefore from our fitting , @xmath111 at 1@xmath5 level , which confirms the point raised analytically by @xcite and @xcite that a light neutron star in j1808.4  is favored .",
    "while our short coverage of the outburst modulation prevents us from conclusive analysis , we have likely detected modulation changes during the outburst .",
    "the second light curve appears to systematically deviate from the simple sinusoidal - like shape , as seen in figure  [ fig : lcr ] .",
    "this deviation could have been caused by disk flux variations during the outburst , with a timescale of 20 min .",
    "on the other hand , a modulation with a narrower flux peak can also explain this .",
    "for example using our model , we qualitatively tested this and found that narrower light curves can indeed be produced with smaller irradiated areas , although much higher temperatures are required to account for similar maximum luminosity .",
    "it is plausible that during the outburst , a hot spot could have formed on the surface of the companion due to strong irradiation by x - rays from the central pulsar .        the third and fourth light curves , 3 days after the second one , changed to have a modulation with 0.1 mag amplitude .",
    "@xcite have reported their detection of a slow - rise and a fast - decline modulation on 2008 oct .",
    "1 , which would strongly suggest the appearance of superhump modulation since or at least on oct . 1 @xcite . as observed in cataclysmic variables ( cvs )",
    ", superhumps do often appear a few days after the start of an outburst ( or superoutburst as in cvs ) . before an accretion disk dumps nearly all",
    "its stored mass to the companion , the disk in the beginning of the outburst expands beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , which induces the tidal instability . as a result , the disk develops into an eccentric form , producing superhump modulation ( e.g. , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "however in our data , not only are the light curves significantly different from that obtained on oct . 1 by elebert et al .",
    "( 2009 ; for example , its modulation amplitude was 0.2 mag ) , but also no clear phase shift of the modulation is seen . in the last two panels of figure  [ fig : lcr ] , we marked superior conjunction of the companion ( i.e. ,",
    "when the pulsar is at 270  from the ascending node ) with two vertical dash - dotted lines , and as can be seen , the maximums of the modulation were in phase with superior conjunction of the companion . for superhump modulation in j1808.4  and given its mass ratio @xmath112 , the expected phase shift would be 0.1 per day , estimated from the empirical relation between superhump and orbital periods and @xmath113 among known superhump binaries @xcite .",
    "our last two outburst light curves are similar to that obtained on oct .",
    "7/8 by @xcite .",
    "we note that there is marginal evidence that an additional component appears in the third light curve and that a weak trend exists in the residuals of the fourth light curve from our model fit .",
    "although the 0.1 mag amplitude modulation was in phase with that of the companion , we speculate that it could consist of modulation components such as from the disk but that modulation from the companion still dominated at the time . in order to understand this modulation , better observational coverage of the source s outbursts and detailed analysis of each component s possible modulation",
    "should be needed . in any case ,",
    "given that the modulation showed significant variations over a few days , further observational studies of the source s modulation over its future outbursts are warranted .",
    "the day - side optical emission from the companion is due to reprocessing of energy flux from the central pulsar .",
    "the required irradiation luminosities in quiescence in our model were in a range of ( 812)@xmath114 erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "the known energy output from the pulsar in quiescence consists of its rotational energy loss rate @xmath10 and x - ray emission , where the latter is two orders of magnitude lower than the former .",
    "therefore the energy output absorbed by the companion is approximately @xmath115 erg  s@xmath9 , where @xmath116 is the albedo of the companion in quiescence and @xmath117 is defined as the beaming factor for the pulsar s emission towards the companion . comparing this value to the irradiation luminosity range",
    ", @xmath118 is required if @xmath119 ( isotropic emission case ) .",
    "however from similar studies of black widow pulsar binaries @xcite , @xmath116 was found to be around 0.6 . if this value is taken for our case , @xmath120 beaming for the pulsar s energy emission would be required .",
    "recently @xcite have proposed a model that irradiation could be due to @xmath121-ray emission from pulsars for apmp systems in quiescence . according to their calculations for j1808.4 ,",
    "a high - mass ( @xmath62 @xmath59 ) neutron star is preferred considering that the irradiation luminosity is @xmath122 erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "their model is therefore not fully supported by our derived limits on the neutron star s mass but compatible within 3@xmath5 .",
    "the required irradiation luminosity during the outburst on 2008 sept .",
    "29 was found to be 6.2@xmath123 erg s@xmath9 , while the data on the other three nights are not considered because of the deviation of their modulations from a simple sinusoid - like shape . nearly at the same time",
    "( mjd 54738.28 ) , the 2.525 kev x - ray luminosity of the pulsar was 3.2@xmath124 erg s@xmath9 @xcite , where 4.1 kpc source distance ( table  [ tab : res ] ) is used .",
    "comparing the two values , the x - ray albedo of the companion @xmath125 for the @xmath119 isotropic emission case .",
    "such a large albedo value has been found in studies of accretion disks x - ray reprocessing @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath126 still holds , @xmath127 would be required .",
    "the difference in the albedo or beaming factor during quiescence and the outburst probably provides additional evidence for having a different heating source in the quiescent state .",
    "we have obtained nearly simultaneous @xmath13 and @xmath14 light curves of j1808.4   in 2008 august and @xmath15 light curves in 2008 september / october , respectively before and after the reported 2008 september 22 x - ray outburst . in the former datasets",

    "the resulting constraints on the masses of the neutron star and companion were found to be 0.751.28 @xmath59 and 0.030.06 @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these results rely on the @xmath23 measurement , which currently is not certain , but ( conservatively ) considering @xmath109 km  s@xmath9 , we found @xmath111 in j1808.4 .    from our fitting , the derived day - side temperature of the companion appeared to be constant over the period of @xmath6500 days during which our quiescent data were obtained .",
    "the derived disk components can be described by a simple disk temperature profile , while a change to a steeper spectrum was possibly seen at the onset of the disk brightening .",
    "no modulation changes that might clearly reveal a different heating source during the outburst were found from our observations .",
    "minor modulation variations , including a change of amplitude from 0.2 mag to 0.1 mag , were detected in our outburst data .",
    "we have possibly found a narrower modulation peak than that seen in quiescence in one set of our data , which could be caused by the existence of a hot spot on the surface of the companion due to intense irradiation by the x - ray pulsar . in order to further study these variations , good observational coverage of the source during its outbursts is needed .",
