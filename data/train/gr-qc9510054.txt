    "the parameters we call `` constants of nature '' can take different values in different parts of the universe and in different disconnected universes in the ensemble described by the cosmological wave function @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution for the constants can be determined with the aid of the `` principle of mediocrity '' @xcite , which asserts that we are `` typical '' among the civilizations inhabiting this ensemble .",
    "the resulting probabilities are then proportional to the physical volumes occupied by thermalized regions with given values of the constants @xcite , and the preferred values tend to be the ones that give the largest amount of inflation .",
    "this prescription encounters a difficulty when applied to models where inflation is `` eternal '' . in such models ,",
    "the universe consists of a number of isolated thermalized regions embedded in a still - inflating background .",
    "new thermalized regions are constantly being formed , but the inflating domains that separate them expand so fast that the universe never thermalizes completely @xcite . in an eternally inflating universe ,",
    "the thermalized volumes @xmath0 diverge as @xmath1 .",
    "( here , the index @xmath2 labels different types of thermalized regions which have different values of the constants of nature . )",
    "if one simply introduces a time cutoff by including only parts of the volumes that thermalized prior to some moment of time @xmath3 , then one finds that the ratio @xmath4 is extremely sensitive to the choice of the time coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "for example , cutoffs at a fixed proper time and at a fixed scale factor give drastically different results @xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure @xcite is to introduce a cutoff at the time @xmath6 when all but a small fraction @xmath7 of the co - moving volume destined to thermalize into regions of type @xmath2 has thermalized .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is taken to be the same for all types of thermalized regions , and for all universes in the ensemble , but the corresponding cutoff times @xmath9 are generally different .",
    "the limit @xmath10 is taken after calculating the probability distribution for the constants . it was shown in @xcite that the resulting probabilities are rather insensitive to the choice of time parametrization .",
    "although this can certainly be regarded as progress , the situation is still not completely satisfactory .",
    "what do we make of the residual , `` mild '' dependence of the probabilities on the choice of the time coordinate @xmath5 ?",
    "this dependence is particularly worrisome when one tries to compare probabilities for different universes in the quantum - cosmological ensemble .",
    "using the @xmath7-procedure , one finds @xcite that the probability distribution has an infinitely sharp peak at the highest value of the ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the smallest eigenvalues of the diffusion equation for the probability distribution of the inflaton field @xmath14 , with normalization to the physical and coordinate volume , respectively . this sharp prediction does not mix well even with a `` mild '' ambiguity in the value of @xmath11 .",
    "an additional source of ambiguity in predictions of eternal inflation is in the form of the diffusion equation itself .",
    "the equation was introduced in refs .",

    ", however , the equation is an approximation to quantum field theory in a curved spacetime , or , if gravity is to be adequately included , to the wheeler - dewitt equation for the cosmological wave function .",
    "this approximate nature of the diffusion equation manifests itself , in particular , in the ambiguity in the ordering of factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the field - dependent diffusion coefficient .    in the present paper",
    "we shall analyze the uncertainties in predictions of the principle of mediocrity resulting both from the choice of the time parameter and of the factor - ordering in the diffusion equation .",
    "it will be shown that the uncertainties of the probabilities due to these two ambiguities are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "since the factor - ordering ambiguity is inherent in the diffusion approximation , the corresponding uncertainty can be regarded as the bound on the accuracy allowed by the model .",
    "our result is then that , within this accuracy , the probabilities are independent of time parametrization .",
    "this is a hopeful sign , since it suggests that a complete independence of time parametrization can be achieved in a more fundamental approach .",

    ", we shall first introduce the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , representing the freedom of time parametrization and factor ordering .",
