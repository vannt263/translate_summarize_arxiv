    "the total cross section @xmath3 is a fundamental quantity in collisions of strongly interacting particles . at present",
    "one of the main theoretical approaches for the description of @xmath4 is the qcd - inspired formalism @xcite . in this approach",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross section is obtained from qcd via an eikonal formulation .",
    "the high - energy dependence of @xmath4 is driven by the rapid increase in gluon density at small-@xmath5 . in this work",
    "we explore the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd in order to describe , in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels , the total cross sections @xmath2 and the ratios of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , @xmath6 . in our calculations",
    "we introduce an energy - dependent dipole form factor which represents the overlap density for the partons at impact parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the behavior of these forward quantities is derived from the qcd parton model using standard parton - parton elementary processes and an updated set of gluon distribution , namely the cteq6l1 set . in our analysis",
    "we have included recent measurements of @xmath0 total cross sections at the lhc by the totem collaboration @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce our qcd - based model where the onset of the dominance of semihard partons is managed by the dynamical gluon mass .",
    "we investigate a form factor which the spatial distribution of gluons changes with the energy and introduce integral dispersion relations to connect the real and imaginary parts of eikonals . in section",
    "iii we present our results and in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in our model the increase of @xmath2 is associated with elementary semihard processes in the hadrons . in the eikonal representation @xmath3 and @xmath8",
    "are given by @xmath9 \\label{eq01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath10 } , \\label{eq03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where @xmath11 is the square of the total center - of - mass energy , @xmath7 is the impact parameter , and @xmath12 is the ( complex ) eikonal function .",
    "the eikonal functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 scatterings are the sum of the soft and semihard ( sh ) parton interactions in the hadron - hadron collision , @xmath13 it follows from the qcd parton model that the real part of the eikonal , @xmath14 , can be factored as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an overlap density for the partons at impact parameter space @xmath7 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the usual qcd cross section @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    the eikonal functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 scatterings are written as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since in the parton model @xmath26 decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath11 , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections is due only to the different weighting of the quark - antiquark ( valence ) annihilation cross sections in the two channels .",
    "thus the crossing - odd eikonal @xmath27 receives no contribution from semihard processes at high energies , and it is sufficient to take @xmath28 and , consequently , @xmath29 .",
    "the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the crossing - even eikonal @xmath30 is obtained by means of dispersion relation @xmath31 valid at @xmath32 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the soft term is given by @xmath34 \\right ] , \\label{soft01}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fitting parameters .",
    "the odd eikonal @xmath27 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 gev and @xmath43 is also a fitting parameter .",
    "in the expression ( [ eq08 ] ) the term @xmath44 is the differential cross section for @xmath45 scattering ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we select parton - parton processes containing at least one gluon in the initial state , i.e. , we consider the processes @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 } ,   \\label{eq26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50^{- 12/11 } ; \\label{mdyna } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath51 is a non - perturbative qcd effective charge , obtained by cornwall through the use of the pinch technique in order to derive a gauge invariant schwinger - dyson equation for the gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "in the case of semihard gluons we consider the possibility of a `` broadening '' of the spatial distribution .",
    "our assumption suggests an increase of the average gluon radius when @xmath52 increases , and can be properly implemented using the energy - dependent dipole form factor @xmath53 where @xmath54 , with @xmath35 gev . here",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are constants to be fitted . from equation ( [ ref009 ] ) we have @xmath57^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{\\nu^{2}_{_{sh}}}{96\\pi } ( \\nu_{_{sh } } b)^{3 } k_{3}(\\nu_{_{sh } } b).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since semihard interactions dominate at high energies , we consider an energy - dependence only in the case of @xmath58 . in this way",
    "the soft overlap densities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are static , i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath61 are not energy dependent .",
    "first , in order to determine the model parameters , we set the value of the gluon mass scale to @xmath62 mev .",
    "this choice for the mass scale is not only consistent to our lo procedure , but is also the one usually obtained in other calculations of strongly interacting processes @xcite .",
    "next , we carry out a global fit to high - energy forward @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering data above @xmath63 gev , namely the total cross section @xmath64 and the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath65 .",
    "we use data sets compiled and analyzed by the particle data group @xcite as well as the recent data at lhc from the totem collaboration , with the statistic and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "we include in the dataset the first estimate for the @xmath66 parameter made by the totem collaboration in their @xmath66-independent measurement at @xmath67 tev , namely @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are given in the legend of figure 1 .",
    "the result @xmath69 for the fit was obtained for 154 degrees of freedom .",
    "the results of the fit to @xmath4 and @xmath66 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels are displayed in figure 1 , together with the experimental data .",
    "the curves depicted in figure 1 were all calculated using the cutoff @xmath70 gev , the value of the cteq6 fixed initial scale @xmath71 .",
    "( @xmath72 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are : @xmath74 gev , @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev@xmath77 , @xmath78 gev@xmath77 , @xmath79 gev@xmath77 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 gev@xmath77.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig1 ]",
    "in this work we have investigated infrared effects on semihard parton - parton interactions .",
    "we have studied @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering in the lhc energy region with the assumption that the increase of their total cross sections arises exclusively from semihard interactions . in the calculation of @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "we have considered the phenomenological implication of an energy - dependent form factor for semihard partons .",
    "we introduce integral dispersion relations to connect the real and imaginary parts of eikonals with energy - dependent form factors . in our analysis",
    "we have included the recent data at lhc from the totem collaboration .",
    "our results show that very good descriptions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 data are obtained by constraining the value of the cutoff at @xmath83 gev .",
    "the @xmath84 for the global fit was 1.062 for 154 degrees of freedom .",
    "this good statistical result shows that our eikonal model , where non - perturbative effects are naturally included via a qcd effective charge , is well suited for detailed predictions of the forward quantities to be measured at higher energies . in the semihard sector",
    "we have considered a form factor in which the average gluon radius increases with @xmath52 . with this assumption",
    "we have obtained another form in which the eikonal can be factored into the qcd parton model , namely @xmath85 . the imaginary part of this _ semi - factorizable _ eikonal was obtained by means of appropriate integral dispersion relations which take into account eikonals with energy - dependent form factors .    at the moment we are analyzing the effects of different updated sets of parton distributions on the forward quantities , namely cteq6l and mstw , investigating the uncertainty on these forward observables coming from the uncertainties associated with the dynamical mass scale and the parton distribution functions , and exploring a new ansatz for the energy - dependent form factor .",
