    "the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase occurs during the late stages of the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "this phase is characterised by intense mass loss and leads to the formation of a circumstellar envelope made of gas and dust .",
    "the molecular composition of this envelope is dependent on the c / o abundance ratio .",
    "the co molecule is very stable and unreactive , and if @xmath4 , all the oxygen is trapped in co. the envelope ( and star ) is then `` carbon - rich '' ; amorphous carbon dominates the dust , while ( after h@xmath0 ) co and c@xmath0h@xmath0 dominate its gas .",
    "the``oxygen - rich '' agb stars are characterised by silicate dust and molecules such as sio , oh , h@xmath0o .",
    "third dredge - up brings the carbon produced by the triple-@xmath5 reactions to the surface , increasing the c / o ratio and over time can change a star from oxygen - rich to carbon - rich .",
    "the mass loss from agb stars is one of the main agents for the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "it expels the products of nuclear reactions in the core of the star into the interstellar medium .",
    "the mass loss from agb stars contributes roughly half of all the gas recycled by stars ( maeder 1992 ) , and up to nearly 90%  of the dust ( gehrz 1989 ) .",
    "mass loss from agb stars is also one of the main sources of carbon in the universe , together with wolf - rayet stars and supernovae ( dray et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the mechanisms driving this mass - loss process are not fully understood .",
    "it is thought to be a two - step process : pulsations from the star lead to the formation of dust , and then radiation pressure accelerates the dust grains to the escape velocity .",
    "the gas is then also expelled due to friction with the dust grains .",
    "the effect of metallicity on the mass - loss rates from agb stars has been discussed at some length .",
    "some works proposed that mass - loss rates should be lower in metal - poor environments , as less dust is expected to form , so that radiation pressure would be less efficient in driving the mass loss ( bowen & willson 1991 ; zijlstra 2004 ) .",
