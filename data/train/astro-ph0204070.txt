    "outflows in seyfert galaxies are evident by resonance line absorption troughs , which are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of their emission counterparts .",

    "2000 ; kaspi et  al .",
    "similar outflows ( often with significantly higher velocities ) are seen in quasars that are the luminous relatives of seyfert galaxies ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; korista voit & weymann 1993 ; arav et al .",
    "reliable measurement of the absorption column densities in the troughs are crucial for determining the ionization equilibrium and abundances of the outflows , and the relationship between the uv and the ionized x - ray absorbers ( mathur et  al .  1995 ; elvis 2001 ) .",
    "in the last few years our group ( arav 1997 ; arav et al . 1999a ; arav et  al .",
    "1999b ; de kool et  al .",
    "2001 ; arav et  al .",

    "1998 , churchill et  al .  1999 ,",
    "ganguly et  al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that in quasar outflows most lines are saturated even when they are not black .",
    "we have also shown that in many cases the shapes of the troughs are almost entirely due to changes in the line of sight covering as a function of velocity , rather than to differences in optical depth ( arav et  al .",
    "1999b ; de  kool et  al . 2001",
    "; arav et  al .",
    "as a consequence , the column densities inferred from the depths of the troughs are only lower limits .",
    "these results have led us to suspect that many of the reported column densities in seyfert outflows are likely underestimated .",
    "recently , we have re - analyzed the _",
    "high resolution spectroscopic data of the intrinsic absorber in ngc  5548 ( arav , korista & de kool 2002 ) and found that the  absorption column density in the main trough is at least four times larger than previously determined .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that similar to the case in quasars , the shape of the main trough is almost entirely due to changes in covering fraction as a function of velocity , and is not due to differences in real optical depth .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the outflow in another seyfert  1 galaxy , ngc  985 .",
    "similar to the ngc  5548 case , the apparent column density ( ly@xmath2 in this case ) is a severe underestimate of the real column density .",
    "furthermore , the resulting errors in the inferred values of the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath3 ) and the ionization parameter ( @xmath4 ) of the absorbing gas are far larger . * for the specific case of ngc  985 , the real @xmath3 and @xmath4 values may allow the x - ray and uv absorbers to arise from the same gas .",
    "* we conclude by highlighting potential difficulties expected in the x - ray spectral analysis of agn outflows , based on the uv investigation shown here and elsewhere .",

    "1998 ) , nearby seyfert  1 galaxy , which shows a strong and complex system of warm absorbers ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 ) in its rosat - pspc ( brandt et  al .  1995 ) and asca ( nicastro et  al .  1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ 985_lya_marked ] we show the available hst data of the intrinsic uv absorber in ngc 985 , which covers the ly@xmath2  and troughs . to find the physical conditions of the absorbing gas we first extract the apparent column densities for the ly@xmath2  and  troughs for the outflow , and then use these values to compute the @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the absorbing gas .",
    "figure [ lya_abs ] shows an unsaturated absorption model for the  trough consisting of an unabsorbed emission model convolved with six gaussian absorption components .",
    "the fit is very good and the main discrepancy ( seen around 1266  ) is due to our restrictive assumption that each kinematic component for ly@xmath2  and  will have the same velocity centroid .",
    "we note in passing that this assumption holds quite well in this case , since four of the ly@xmath2  components are fitted very well using the velocity centroid of the components . for absorption component  4 ,",
    "the gaussian parameters yield @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ nv_abs ] shows an unsaturated absorption model for the absorption .",
    "components  4 and 5 are not saturated ( or only slightly so ) since their depths in the red and blue doublet lines are consistent with the expected 1:2 optical depth ratio ( the ratio of their oscillator strengths ) . for absorption component  4 ,",
    "the gaussian parameters yield @xmath11    it is usually assumed that the plasma is in photoionization equilibrium and therefore the relevant physical parameters are the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath3 ) and the ionization parameter ( @xmath4 ) of the absorbing gas . in order to determine these we use the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) to try to find combinations of these parameters which will reproduce the measured column densities .    in figure [ nh_u_hst ]",
    "we show photoionization solutions for absorption component  4 .",
    "the presentation method is based on the grid models approach developed in arav et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) , using the same ionizing continuum .",
    "we plot curves of constant @xmath12 ( determined from the observed troughs ) in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "that is , within the range of plotted parameters , any combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 that falls on the curve yields the desired column density value ( for an assumed set of elemental abundances , solar in our case ) .",
    "the parameters of the absorber are determined by the crossing of the different @xmath12 curves .",
    "we note that with two given curves we can obtain two solutions , since two crossing points are possible . by coincidence",
    ", we obtained a single solution in this particular case .",
    "the inferred @xmath3 is at least two orders of magnitude too small to account for a typical warm absorber column density ( kaastra et  al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi et  al .",
    ".      however , our ionization equilibrium inferences are crucially dependent upon the reliability of the  and  column densities inferred from our absorption models ( figs .  [ lya_abs ] and [ nv_abs ] ) .",
    "the evidence we have collected over the last few years suggests that * it is impossible in principle to extract a reliable column density from one singlet line * ( see   1 and arav et  al .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that our  inferred  column density is greatly underestimated .",
    "luckily we possess fuse spectra that covers the and  outflow troughs in ngc  985 , and can directly check the reliability of the  model .",
    "figure [ lyb_abs ] shows the results of applying the absorption model to the  trough .",
    "our very good model - fit for the  trough ( fig .",
    "[ lya_abs ] ) fails completely when we apply it to the  trough assuming no saturation ( upper dotted line ) .",
    "a model assuming complete saturation ( lower dotted line ) fits the data considerably better , but since it over - predicts the depth of the troughs we determine that the  is not heavily saturated .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the shape of the  trough where all the components except number  6 are significantly shallower .",
    "the apparent  column density of component  4 , as measured from the ly@xmath2  trough , is 5@xmath0 smaller than its real  column density deduced with the constraints imposed by the  and  troughs . in passing ,",
    "we mention that the fuse spectra also show saturation in the  lines .",
    "figure [ nh_u_hst_fuse ] illustrates the consequence of ignoring the possibility of saturation in ly@xmath2 and therefore underestimating the  column density in component  4 by a factor of five .",
    "the physical solution that uses the real  column density results in an absorber with 100@xmath0 higher @xmath14 and roughly a 10@xmath0 higher ionization parameter than the one using the apparent column density .",
    "the relative difference between the two solutions is a robust key point of this investigation .",
    "absolute values of the correct @xmath14 and @xmath4 are far less accurate due to the systematic uncertainties in chemical abundances and incident ionizing spectrum , as well as the reliance on only to ionic column densities .",
    "nonetheless , we point out that he solution based on realistic column density is compatible with physical parameters inferred for warm absorbers in general ( kaastra et  al .  2000 ; kaspi et  al .",
    "2000 ) , while the apparent one is much too low in both @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "non - black saturation is prevalent in uv troughs of agn outflows , even when the trough is fully resolved spectroscopically .",
    "this suggests that the same phenomenon occur in the x - ray troughs of the same objects .",
    "in addition , a single covering fraction per absorption component is a poor approximation , since covering fraction is often strongly velocity - dependent .",
    "2 .   errors in column density estimates can be greatly amplified in the inferred ionization equilibrium for the absorbing gas . in the case of component  4 in ngc  985 , correcting the @xmath15 by a factor of five resulted in a two orders of magnitude higher @xmath14 and an order of magnitude higher @xmath4 .",
    "these differences are large enough to make uv component  4 compatible with being the same gas as the x - ray warm absorber .",
    "3 .   many line series are covered by the x - ray band , thus allowing for excellent saturation diagnostics and thus the extraction of reliable column densities .",
    "however , care must be taken to allow for non - black saturation , which is very different from saturation due too spectroscopically unresolved absorption components .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through grant number hst - ar-09079 from the stsci , and by nasa ltsa grant 2001 - 029 .",
