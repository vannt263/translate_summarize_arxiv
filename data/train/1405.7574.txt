    "in low - mass star forming regions , most of the starless dense cores , whose densities are 10@xmath3 @xmath2 , do not seem to be dynamically collapsing because the timescale statistically derived is larger than the free fall time @xcite and because the density distribution is flat toward the peak @xcite . the subsequent evolutionary stage we can easily observe is a class 0/i protostar phase , which shows strong outflow , indicating that the gravity is strong , and then mature protostellar cores were already formed .",
    "recent observations of class 0 protostars , the earliest phase of protostars whose ages are 10@xmath4 yr , in nearby low - mass star forming regions have revealed a high frequency ( @xmath02/3 ) of binary or multiple protostars @xcite , and complex gas structures in the envelopes on spatial scales from 0.1 pc to @xmath01000 au @xcite .",
    "however , there remains a missing observational link between the complex envelope and formed protostars .",
    "it is key in the understanding of the origin of binary or multiple systems , for example , how the surrounding gas interacts with each other to form stars at the center of a dense core .",
    "it has been difficult to observe the objects between the starless and class 0/i stages because the timescale is very short and the identification is observationally difficult .",
    "recently , there have been many studies for the objects containing the first protostellar core @xcite .",
    "one of such objects is mc27 @xcite or l1521f @xcite .",
    "it is of very high density and contains one of the faintest protostars detected by _",
    "( hereafter , the _ spitzer _ source ) , which indicates that it is among the youngest and still may preserve the initial conditions of star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggests that the _ spitzer _ source lies at the apex of a bright but compact conical - shaped nebula at 4.5 @xmath5 m , which opens to the west , and @xcite also suggests that the source has a moderate inclination .",
    "previous observations found that the spatial distribution of mc27 in three different density tracers ranging from 10@xmath6 @xmath2 is consistent with steep power - law distribution of an index of @xmath7 @xcite , which is consistent with the infalling envelope of the larson ",
    "penston solution in the early phase of star formation , and is different from what is usually derived for several starless cores @xcite .",
    "an indication of compact and dense molecular outflow whose size is smaller than 1500 au is also detected @xcite .",
    "interferometric dust observation detected a single source @xcite , which coincides with the protostar , and no other features were detected although the surrounding envelope has complex velocity structures as revealed by molecular line observations @xcite .",
    "these interferometric observations with high angular resolutions failed to detect extended high - density gas around the _ spitzer _ source due to the lack of the sensitivity and to the narrow spatial frequency coverage .",
    "we carried out alma band 6 ( 211275 ghz ) observations toward mc27/l1521f with the center position of ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) = ( 4@xmath1028@xmath113892 , + 2651362 ) during early science cycle 0 .",
    "the target molecular lines were hco@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ; 267.55763 ghz ) , hcn ( @xmath13 = 32 ; 265.88643 ghz ) , h@xmath14co@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ; 260.25534 ghz ) , cs ( @xmath13 = 54 ; 244.93556 ghz ) , and sio ( @xmath13 = 65 ; 260.51802 ghz ) .",
    "for the first two lines , seven - pointing mosaic observations have been carried out around the center position on 2012 january 11 and on 2012 november 5 and 6 , and single - pointing observations for the rest on 2012 january 11 and on 2012 november 5 .",
    "the january observations were carried out by using 16 antennas with a compact configuration , and the november observations by 24 antennas with a compact+extended configuration .",
    "the baselines range from 26.5 m to 381.8 m , corresponding to _ uv _ distances from 12.2 to 211 k@xmath15 .",
    "the correlator was used in the frequency domain mode with a bandwidth of 234.4 mhz ( 61.04 khz @xmath16 3840 channels ) .",
    "the calibration of the complex gains was carried out through observations of j0423013 , phase calibration on 3c111 , and flux calibration on j0538440 , callisto and ganymede .",
    "for the flux calibration of the solar system objects , we used the butler - jpl - horizons 2012 model ( https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/aboutalma/technology/alma_memo_series/ + alma594/abs594 ) .",
    "the data were processed in the common astronomy software applications package ( http://casa.nrao.edu ) , and visibilities imaged .",
    "the synthesized beam is @xmath010 @xmath16 08 = 140 au @xmath16 110 au for hco@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) and scales approximately with the frequency for other transitions ( see also figures [ fig1][fig3 ] ) .",
    "the ( 1@xmath17 ) rms of molecular lines are @xmath08 mjy beam@xmath18 with a velocity resolution of @xmath00.14 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the dust continuum emission was extracted by integrating all the frequency ranges except for the line frequencies . the synthesized beam and rms for the continuum map are @xmath011 @xmath16 08 , and 0.12 mjy beam@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that there are three major continuum peaks ( the parameters are listed in table [ table1 ] ) , and one of which , mms-1 , coincides with the position of the _ spitzer _ source .",
    "mms-1 is not spatially resolved by the present observation with an angular resolution of @xmath01 , and was also detected as a point source with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) observation with an angular resolution of @xmath004 @xcite .",
    "we have not detected any line intensity enhancements toward the _",
    "source , confirming that the _ spitzer _ source has no associated extended envelope .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] also shows that there is an extended core , mms-2 , with a beam - convolved diameter of @xmath0380 au ( see table [ table1 ] ) to the southwest of the _ spitzer _ source . a clear intensity enhancement of h@xmath14co@xmath12(@xmath13 = 32 ) , a high - density gas tracer , is seen toward mms-2 , showing that the dust continuum peak is due to the density enhancement .",
    "we calculated the mass from the dust emission assuming optically thin emission and constant dust temperature with the following equations ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 where , @xmath21 is the mass absorption coefficient , @xmath22 is the plank function , @xmath23 is the integrated flux of the continuum emission at frequency @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the dust temperature , @xmath26 is the distance of the source ( 140 pc @xcite ) , @xmath27 = 0.01 @xmath28 g@xmath18 of interstellar matter is the emissivity of the dust continuum at 231 ghz @xcite , and @xmath29 is the dust emissivity index .",
    "we also estimated the column density of h@xmath30 from the dust emission with the following equation ; @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the flux per beam , @xmath33 is the solid angle of the beam , @xmath34 is the molecular weight per hydrogen , and @xmath35 is the h - atom mass .",
    "we assumed @xmath25 = 10 k and @xmath29 = 1 @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters are shown in table [ table1 ] .    under the assumption of the local thermodynamical equilibrium condition and optically thin molecular line emission , we also estimated the mass and column density from the h@xmath14co@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) data .",
    "the excitation temperature is adopted as 10 k. the fractional abundance of h@xmath14co@xmath12 relative to h@xmath36 is adopted as @xmath37 = 1.0 @xmath16 10@xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the density of mms-2 derived by dividing the dust column density by the size is calculated to be @xmath010@xmath39 @xmath2 , which is so far the highest among starless gas condensations in low - mass star forming regions .",
    "the peak antenna temperature of the h@xmath14co@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) spectra is as high as @xmath07 k , which means that the line gets almost optically thick and that we need observations in more rare species to look into the central part .",
    "these results indicate that this core is one of the most evolved starless condensations , or may contain very faint protostar of @xmath40 0.1 @xmath41 not detected by _ spitzer _ , which is a strong candidate for searching for a first protostellar core , the first quasi - hydrostatic object during the star formation process @xcite .",
    "there is also another low - intensity dust core toward the northwest of the _ spitzer _ source , mms-3 .",
    "there is an enhancement of h@xmath14co@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) toward mms-3 , and this fact indicates that mms-3 is also a high - density core with a density of 10@xmath42 @xmath2 .",
    "we found a very compact bipolar outflow centered at the _ spitzer _ source .",
    "figures [ fig2](a)(c ) show the distribution of outflowing gas in hco@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) on the _ spitzer _ image .",
    "figure [ fig2](d ) shows the spectra toward the outflowing gas .",
    "blueshifted gas is seen toward the west of the _ spitzer _ source , and the redshifted gas toward the opposite direction .",
    "this direction is consistent with that of the outflow cavity ; the west cavity toward us and the east cavity away from us @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed the first detection of a compact outflow in @xmath43co(@xmath13 = 21 ) toward the _",
    "source , although the @xmath43co(@xmath13 = 21 ) outflow direction is opposite to what we observed .",
    "this may be because the critical density for the excitation of the @xmath43co(@xmath13 = 21 ) is much lower than that of hco@xmath44(@xmath13 = 32 ) , and thus the @xmath43co(@xmath13 = 21 ) just traces the velocity structure of the lower - density surrounding gas .",
    "we estimated the size ( @xmath45 ) and velocity ( @xmath46 ) of the outflow for the red and blue components by use of the following equations ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the projected distance to the peak intensity of the outflow lobe position from the _ spitzer _ source , and @xmath50 is the maximum radial velocity measured from hco@xmath44(@xmath13 = 32 ) data .",
    "then , the dynamical timescale is calculated to be @xmath51 .",
    "we assume here that the inclination angle @xmath52 , which is defined as 0@xmath53 for the plane of the sky , is @xmath54@xmath53@xmath55@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "maximum velocities of blueshifted and redshifted components are @xmath56@xmath57 and @xmath58@xmath54 km s@xmath18 , and the sizes are @xmath59@xmath60 and @xmath61@xmath62 au , respectively .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the outflow is thus estimated to be a few hundred years ( blue = @xmath63@xmath64 yr , red = @xmath65@xmath66 yr ) , and this indicates that mass accretion is still taking place at the _",
    "spitzer _ source .",
    "figures [ fig2](a)(c ) also show that both the red- and blueshifted outflowing gas seem to delineate the gas with lower velocities ; the blueshifted gas delineates the starless dust core ( mms-2 ) , and the redshifted gas is located at the edge of the @xmath67@xmath68 km s@xmath18 velocity component of hco@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) .",
    "this fact implies that the outflowing gas is interacting with the surrounding gas , and that the compression and/or abundance enhancement due to the shock are shown as the molecular outflow .",
    "figures [ fig2](b ) and ( c ) show the intensity distributions of the cs ( @xmath13 = 54 ) and hcn ( @xmath13 = 32 ) , which are optically thicker than h@xmath14co@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) and optically thinner than hco@xmath44 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) ; the intensities have the peak close to the blueshifted outflow component rather than toward the h@xmath14co@xmath44 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) peak , implying that the molecular abundances are enhanced toward the interacting region .",
    "the reason why the redshifted outflow component is not continuously distributed from the source position can be explained that there was no dense gas between the source and the present redshifted component or the mass outflow is episodic .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the velocity channel maps of the hco@xmath12 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) and h@xmath14co@xmath44 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) emission .",
    "the systemic velocity of mc27/l1521f with single - dish observations is about 6.5 km s@xmath18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we can observe no significant emission of hco@xmath44 ( @xmath13 = 32 ) around the velocity .",
    "the lack of the emission is due to a combination of the optical thickness of the line and the extended emission missing due to the interferometry observation .",
    "the striking feature is seen in the red component around 7 km s@xmath18 ; we see a long arc - like structure with a few core - like features ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the length of the arc - like structure is @xmath02000 au , and there is a slight velocity shift along and across the arc . the arc - like structure of hco@xmath12(@xmath13 = 32 ) on 1000 au scale can be considered as a consequence of the dynamical interaction between the small dense cores and the surrounding gas on that scale .",
    "the typical velocity of the arc - like structure is @xmath00.5 km s@xmath18 with respect to the systemic velocity , and it is comparable to the dynamical velocity on that scale , e.g. , the kepler velocity for a mass of 0.1 @xmath69 and a radius of 1000 au is 0.3 km s@xmath18 .",
    "similar arc - like structures have been reported in the previous numerical simulations of the turbulent fragmentation models @xcite , where turbulence promotes fragmentation of cloud cores during the collapse and dynamical interaction of the fragments provide arcs or spiral arms in the envelopes .",
    "this indicates that in mc27 the turbulence plays an important role in undergoing fragmentation in the central part of the cloud core , which is different from the classic scenarios of fragmentation in massive disks @xcite .",
    "the driving source of the turbulence may be the complex velocity structure in the larger scale surrounding gas observed in the previous observation @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario is an interaction of cloud cores , which are formed by the fragmentation of a filamentary cloud .",
    "the filamentary structures in many interstellar clouds are revealed by the recent _ herschel _ observations @xcite , and the interaction of the cloud cores is a natural consequence of fragmentation of the filamentary cloud @xcite .",
    "all of these facts above indicate that there are many regions with different evolutionary states even just within @xmath01000 au .",
    "there is a very low - luminosity source with a very compact outflow , and there are at least two high - density cores detected both in dust continuum emission and h@xmath14co@xmath44(@xmath13 = 32 ) , indicating a possible formation site of multiple stars with separations of a few hundred au .",
    "there are also a few lower - density cores as shown in the hco@xmath44(@xmath13 = 32 ) data .",
    "some gas components are dynamically interacting as seen in hco@xmath44(@xmath13 = 32 ) , and the compact outflow has an indication of interaction with the surrounding gas .",
    "these complex spatial and velocity structures indicate that the initial condition of low - mass star formation is highly dynamical .",
    "the dynamical interaction of the gas may be also important for the determination of the stellar mass . actually , the lack of intensity enhancement in the observed lines toward the _ spitzer",
    "_ source , which is shown in section [ hddc ] , may be due to striping the surrounding gas or to the different velocity of the formed star compared with the surrounding gas in a turbulent environment .",
    "the importance of this type of observational study is found to be the high spatial resolution observation with wide spatial frequency dynamic range .",
    "previous observations could not observe most of features detected here , and then the alma observations will revolutionary change the picture of star formation .",
