    "the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in our universe is now well established by the very precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment @xcite .",
    "one of the most appealing and natural cdm particle candidates is provided by supersymmetric models with @xmath3-parity conservation @xcite .",
    "this @xmath3-parity conservation ensures the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) so that the lsp can be cdm .",
    "the lsp is in general the lightest neutralino , a linear combination of neutral electroweak ( ew ) gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "since the nature of lsp depends on its precise compositions , its detection can vary a lot .",
    "one of the proposed methods of detecting the dark matter is through direct search experiments .",
    "the dark matter particles move at a velocity relative to the detecting materials .",
    "it will recoil against the nucleons , and create either ( 1 ) phonon , ( 2 ) scintillation or ( 3 ) ionization signal , which can be amplified by electronics .",
    "the cdms experiment is of the first type , while the xenon experiment is combination of types ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "recently , the cdms ii finalized their search in ref .",
    "when they opened the black box in their blind analysis , they found two candidate events , which are consistent with background fluctuation at a probability level of about 23% . nevertheless , the signal is not conclusive .",
    "the cdms then improves upon the upper limit on the spin - independent cross section @xmath4 to @xmath5 for @xmath6 gev . using this new limit",
    "we have put a new bound on the higgs - dark - matter coupling @xcite , which can be implied to an upper limit on the higgs boson invisible width .",
    "more recently , xenon100 @xcite has also reported no signals in their detectors and put a similar upper limit on the spin - independent cross section @xmath4 to @xmath7 for @xmath8 gev .",
    "there is a new class of models for dark matter candidates , motivated by hidden - sector models .",
    "it could be a fermion or boson inside the hidden sector .",
    "the interactions with the standard model ( sm ) particles are only possible via @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing , stueckelberg - type mixing , higgs - portal type models .",
    "we focus on the former two possibilities in the following .",
    "two of us @xcite and nath _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had proposed the dirac fermion , denoted by @xmath9 , in the hidden sector as the dark matter candidate .",
    "correct relic density can be obtained by adjusting the mass of the dark matter , the mass of the @xmath0 boson , and the coupling strength @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the effective coupling between the dark matter and the nucleon in the stueckelberg @xmath0 model .",
    "there are two possibilities for the effective interactions : ( i ) the general mixings among the photon , @xmath1 and @xmath0 make it possible for the hidden sector dark matter couples to the sm quarks at the tree level ; ( ii ) it is obvious that the fermion @xmath9 has no direct coupling to the higgs boson at the tree level . however , we point out that an effective coupling @xmath10 can be generated between the dirac fermion @xmath9 and the higgs boson through a triangular loop of @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 bosons .",
    "it therefore gives rise to spin - independent scattering cross section that may be measurable with direct detection experiments .",
    "we show that the effective couplings in case ( i ) will provide useful constraints in the model , while case ( ii ) will give rise to spin - independent cross sections , which are consistent with the most recent cdms ii and xenon100 results .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly describe the spin - independent cross sections in terms of the effective couplings between the dark matter and the nucleon for both vector and scalar contributions in a model independent manner . in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize some major features of the stueckelberg @xmath0 model and the generic @xmath11 mixing model . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the effective couplings for both vector and scalar contributions in the stueckelberg @xmath0 model .",
    "explicit results for the scalar contributions are presented for the stueckelberg @xmath0 model as well as the generic @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing model .",
    "comparisons with the experimental limits are made .",
    "finally , we summarize in sec . v.",
    "direct detection of the fermionic dark matter depends on the assumption how dark matter interacts with the nuclei or with the quarks from the more fundamental viewpoint .",
    "contributions to the spin - independent cross section depend on the underlying mechanism is either dominated by vector gauge boson exchange or higgs boson exchange or combination of both , depending on the specific model .",
    "we will first discuss these contributions in a model independent way .",
    "suppose the effective interactions between the dark matter particle ( denoted by @xmath9 in the following ) and the quarks are given by @xmath12 with the model dependent scalar and vector couplings specified by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , then the spin - independent cross section between @xmath9 and each of the nucleon ( taking the average between proton and neutron ) is given by , ( assuming a dirac type fermion ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reduced mass between the dark matter particle and the nucleon @xmath17 , and @xmath18 where the relation @xmath19 has been used for the the nucleon matrix element @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath22 is @xmath23 , we take the average between proton and neutron ( assume number of protons is about the same as neutrons in the nuclei ) and thus obtain the expression for a single nucleon @xmath24 this is useful for direct comparison with the results given by experiments , where usually the dark - matter - nucleon cross sections are reported .    in the case of the dominance by higgs boson exchange , we write @xmath13 as @xmath25 and @xmath26 takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the effective coupling between the dark matter particle @xmath9 and the higgs boson",
    ", @xmath28 is the yukawa coupling of the quark @xmath29 .",
    "note that the @xmath30 dependence in the yukawa coupling @xmath31 will be cancelled by the @xmath32 dependence coming from the matrix element @xmath33 . in the scenario where the higgs boson exchange is dominant",
    ", the experimental upper limit on the spin - independent cross section can imply an upper limit for the dark matter - higgs coupling , which is more or less model independent .",
    "default values of the parameters used , e.g. in darksusy @xcite are @xmath34 we take the average between proton and neutron for @xmath4 . for @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 and the spin - independent cross section was estimated to be @xcite @xmath37 using the new cdms ii limit of @xmath38 and taking @xmath39 gev , we can obtain an upper limit on the higgs - dark - matter coupling @xcite @xmath40 similar constraint on @xmath41 can be deduced by using the xenon100 limit .",

    "there are also axial couplings among the dark matter with @xmath1 and @xmath0 , but they only contribute to the spin - dependent cross sections . for multi - component dark matter model of stueckelberg type with both dirac and majorana hidden fermions , see the recent work of ref.@xcite .    due to the @xmath82-channel pole",
    ", one might expect the photon exchange diagram will be the dominant contribution for the spin - independent dark matter - nucleon cross section and thus the cdms ii result can be used to eliminate the milli - charged dark matter model .",
    "however , for the milli - charged dark matter to get detected inside the underground detectors , it has to traverse our whole atmosphere and penetrate through the surface rock .",
    "the milli - charged dark matter interacting with the ordinary matter through the long range coulombic force might lose all its kinetic energy before it reaches the detector .",

    ", we obtain an estimate for @xmath100 \\ ; .\\ ] ] this is roughly two orders of magnitude below the current cdms ii and xenon100 limits .",
    "thus , one can not put stringent constraint on the vector couplings of the dark matter @xmath9 with the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bosons in the stueckelberg model yet .",
    "however , the long range coulomb interaction between the milli - charged dark matter and the nuclei of the detectors may be too severe for the dark matter to reach the detector in this scenario . in this case",
    "the above formula ( [ spin - indep - xsec - z ] ) for the spin - independent cross section derived from the effective 4-fermion local operator is no longer applicable . on the other hand ,",
    "the cdms ii and xenon100 limits can be used to place useful constraint on the mixing angle in generic @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing model presented in previous section .",
    "furthermore , xenon100 is expected to improve its upper limit by one to two order of magnitudes in the future .",
    "the parameter space of the stueckelberg @xmath0 model will be probed more effectively by this future improvement",
    ".      the effective coupling between the sm higgs and the hidden milli - charged dark matter @xmath9 can be induced at one - loop level .",
    "the calculation is similar to the one loop electroweak correction to the @xmath101 coupling except there are no @xmath102 and unphysical higgs bosons @xmath103 running inside the loops .",
    "thus to simplify our calculation we will proceed using the t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "we can write down the following amplitude for the effective coupling of higgs-@xmath9-@xmath9 @xmath104\\chi(p ) \\ ; h\\ ] ] with @xmath105 and @xmath106 being the scalar and pseudoscalar form factors , and @xmath107 . for on - shell @xmath9 in the initial and final states ,",
    "we find that @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the gauge coupling of the fermion @xmath9 to the vector gauge boson in the hidden sector , @xmath111 and @xmath112 contains the coupling of @xmath113 and the mixing angles of @xmath114 and @xmath115 with the hidden - sector dark matter",
    ". we will give these couplings explicitly in the stueckelberg @xmath0 model and the generic @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing model in the subsections .",
    "the effective higgs - dark - matter coupling @xmath10 relevant for spin - independent cross section is then given by @xmath116 in which the elastic scattering of the @xmath9 is at @xmath117 .",
    "if kinematically allowed , the sm higgs can decay into the invisible @xmath118 mode and its width is given by @xmath119     the spin - independent cross section @xmath4 versus the mass of the @xmath0 boson in the stueckelberg model .",

    "it is evident from this plot that for a wide range of parameters scenario discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the results are still several orders below the current cdms ii limit . ] in this model , the predictions of the spin - independent cross sections are consistent with the latest cdms ii experiment .",
    "no severe constraints can be deduced for this model from the current cdms experiment .",
    "similar conclusions can be obtained for the generic @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing model since the mixing angle is generally constrained to be rather tiny @xmath125 .",
    "we have also checked that the invisible decay width of the higgs decay @xmath126 given by eq.([inv - width ] ) is very tiny and will not have any significant effects on the higgs boson decay .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the nucleon - dark - matter scattering due to ( i ) tree - level mixing between the hidden sector gauge boson and the sm gauge bosons , and ( ii ) the one - loop induced coupling between the sm higgs boson and the dirac fermionic dark matter in the hidden sector .",
    "such couplings can contribute to the spin - independent cross section for the dark matter direct detection .",
    "however , for a wide class of @xmath1-@xmath0 models we found that these scalar contributions to the spin - independent cross sections are well below the current cdms ii and xenon100 experiments . the current experimental limits do not provide useful constraints for the vector couplings of the dark matter with the neutral gauge bosons in the stueckelberg @xmath0 model but may place more restrictive constraints in generic @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing models . furthermore , in the case that the dark matter particle has a milli - charge of order @xmath2 ( e.g. in the stueckelberg - type mixing ) , it can not traverse the atmosphere to the detector because it lost all its kinetic energy by colliding with nucleons .",
    "in such a case , the direct detection limits can not apply .",
    "projected upper limit on the spin - independent cross section for xenon100 is expected to have improvements by one to two orders of magnitudes and thus it can probe the parameter space of the model more effectively .",
