    "* experimental set - up details*.the experimental photonic quantum simulator consists in the doubly displaced sagnac interferometer set - up presented in fig .",
    "[ figset - up ] ( b ) that allows to prepare the two - photon three - qubit state @xmath89 , simulate a transverse magnetic field and measure two - photon coincidence detection events in different projection basis of the three spins .",
    "the conceptual set - up was already described in the main text and in fig .",
    "[ figset - up ] ( a ) ; here we explicit the correspondence between the actual sagnac - based set - up and the former and give details on the role played by the different optical elements .",
    "the preparation of @xmath89 is achieved thanks to the beam - splitter @xmath90 and the 45@xmath36-oriented half - wave plate ( @xmath91 ) in the transmitted path . the optical delay introduced by this hwp",
    "was compensated by a second hwp with its axis at 0@xmath36 with respect to the horizontal direction in the reflected path ( @xmath92 )",
    ".    the transverse magnetic field is then simulated by splitting the polarization components of photon b , both for the reflected and transmitted path , with the polarizing beam splitter @xmath93 and introducing a variable attenuation filter ( @xmath94 ) common to the paths @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "again , a second glass slab ( @xmath98 ) on the path @xmath99 is used to maintain paths of equal optical length in the interferometer .",
    "the polarization components are then recombined on the pbs before projective measurements are performed .",
    "let us notice that , because of an unbalance in the bs double transmission ( @xmath100 ) and double reflection ( @xmath101 ) coefficients , as well as in the spdc source hh - cone ( @xmath102 ) and vv - cone ( @xmath103 ) emission probabilities , the state that is actually generated in our experiment is @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "this is why we chose to trace out qubit 1 for the evaluation of the bipartite entanglement witness @xmath106 : we can see that in this case we obtain more balance between the @xmath107 and @xmath108 parts of the reduced density matrix @xmath109 , as is the case in the ideal ground state .",
    "the correspondence between the attenuation coefficient and the simulated value of @xmath110 ( and thus of @xmath40 ) is given by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 stand for the probability of two - photon coincidence of state @xmath113 .",
    "in the experiment , we could vary @xmath114 from 0.1 to 4 , and thus achieve values of @xmath40 within the interval @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "finally , projective measurements are done on both photons before registering their coincidence detection with two single photon avalanche photodiodes ( spad ) and a coincidence counting electronics . for both polarization qubits ,",
    "this is achieved by a standard polarization analysis set - up consisting of a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) , a hwp and a pbs , while for the path qubit the projection on different basis is achieved by the second passage through @xmath90 and a glass plate ( @xmath116 ) that can be rotated in the transmitted path so as to change the relative phase between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the optical delay introduced by this glass plate is compensated by two glass plates ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) inserted in the reflected path .",
    "note that these two glass plates are also used to correct for the @xmath121 phase difference introduced by @xmath92 between the horizontal and vertical polarization components of the reflected path .",

    "<S> although in systems of only finite size the thermodynamical limit might be far from being achieved , interesting phenomena related to the appearance of long - range quantum mechanical correlations occur . </S>",

    "<S> in his seminal 1982 paper  @xcite , richard feynman put forward the thought - provoking idea that more powerful synthetic emulations of quantum physics and chemistry would be possible by using quantum mechanical simulators rather than their classical versions . </S>",

    "<S> frustration in a heisenberg chain has been studied in an analog photonic quantum simulator  @xcite , while special topologically protected bound states appearing in condensed - matter physics have been emulated by the means of photonic quantum walks  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our analysis is conducted by experimentally assessing the multipartite bell - like inequality embodied by the svetlichny formulation  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , by exploiting the analytical link between the svetlichny inequality and the measure of genuine multipartite entanglement embodied by the three - tangle  [ 3tangle ] , we estimate the degree of tripartite entanglement shared by the spins of an ising chain at a set degree of violation of the svetlichny inequality . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , such estimate is possible without a tomographically complete reconstruction of the ground state of the system .    </S>",

    "<S> moreover , we have been able to provide an estimate of the values taken by the three - tangle of the state of the simulated chain at hand made on the basis of the experimentally measured values of @xmath54 together with a comparison with the value of @xmath69 that could be reconstructed putting together the outcomes of our experimental measurements of multi - spin correlation functions [ cf . </S>",

    "<S> [ 3tangle ] * ( a ) * ] .    </S>",
    "<S> however , an important point should be remarked : a fair comparison between experimental results and theoretical prediction will have to take into account the imperfections of the optically simulated ground state with respect to the ideal one @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the real photonic state is affected by background noise that mixes the ground state of the spin ring to white noise , so to obtain the werner state @xmath76 , where @xmath77 depends on the signal to noise ratio @xmath78 . in our simulator , the value of the effective magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> is changed by attenuating the signal in specific paths in the interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there is less signal in those paths for large values of @xmath79 than for small ones , which results in a @xmath78 that diminishes with increasing values of @xmath79 . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , this makes @xmath80 dependent on @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally found that @xmath81 , which allowed us to compute the blue theoretical curves in the graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between the measured and theoretical values confirms that our photonic simulator does mimic well the targeted three - spin ring ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> as it can be seen from the graphs , the quantum correlations of the ground state of the ring undergo a profound modification at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> first , the bipartite non - locality [ fig . [ figresultats ] ( a ) ] , which is null both for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , reaches a non - null value close to the point of structural changes for the model which would correspond to the critical point at the thermodynamic limit . at the same time , the tripartite non - locality witnessed by the svetlichny function [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figresultats ] ( b ) ] , which is maximum for @xmath82 when the ground state is close to a ghz state , decreases continuously as @xmath79 increases and reduces to values lower than the non - locality threshold just after the structural - change point . the inflexion point that is visible in the plot of @xmath84 against @xmath40 , close to the expected critical point , reveals in turn that the derivative @xmath85 will have a maximum at that point . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figresultats ] ( c ) , which demonstrates the sensitivity of the figure of merit embodied by @xmath85 to the modifications undergone by the structure of multipartite quantum correlations of our system in the proximity of the ` critical point ' @xmath86 .        </S>",
    "<S> let us also notice that the noise affecting the simulated state only induces a quantitative reduction on the measured svetlichny function but does not change the value of @xmath40 at which the criticality - induced modifications to the sharing of quantum correlations occur . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath87 and the point of inflexion of @xmath54 are found at @xmath86 independently of the amount of noise affecting the state . </S>",
    "<S> this guarantees the correct detection of the critical point even though the system is not perfectly simulated , which is encouraging for potential medium - size system simulations for which no classical computation can be made . on the other hand , the mixed nature of the state affected by noise demands the modification of the definition of @xmath69 and its reformulation in terms of convex - roof extensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of three - tangle for general three - qubit states is in general a very demanding task that goes beyond the scopes of our experimental work . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of the results presented in fig .  [ 3tangle ] ( a ) shows that both our experimental reconstruction and the values estimated using eq .   </S>",
    "<S> are very close to the behavior expected for the proper ground state of the simulated chain , hinting strongly at the very good quality of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath70 is well suited for mixed states of three spins without modifications to the definition provided above . </S>",
    "<S> this has enabled us to generalise the link between tripartite negativity and svetlichny function so to provide a non - tomographic estimate of the amount of tripartite entanglement content of @xmath88 based on the experimentally measured values of @xmath54 [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> table  [ default ] ] . </S>",
    "<S> these values are reported in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 3tangle ] ( b ) , showing the excellent agreement of our estimates and the expected functional relation between @xmath70 and the svetlichny parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally studied multipartite non - locality in a short ising ring , whose ground state undergoes important changes , at the level of the quantum - correlation sharing , as the model approaches its critical point . </S>",
    "<S> our study has been enabled by the experimental implementation of a flexible photonics quantum simulator that , by exploiting the potential of reliable hyper - entangled resources , is able to reproduce the salient features of the ground state of the ising model in an ample range of experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that , when extended to the simulation of equilibrium states at a non - zero effective temperature , our study paves the way to the experimental investigation of interesting many - body effects in photonics quantum simulators  @xcite , from criticality to quantum thermodynamics . </S>"
