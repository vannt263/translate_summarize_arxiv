    "there is an ongoing dispute on which instability plays more important roles in shock revival .",
    "recently , we have published a parametric study by 3d simulations of flow patterns produced by the neutrino - driven convection and sasi @xcite .",

    "rigidly rotating matter is injected from the outer boundary into the supersonic inflow with its @xmath22 increased every 500 ms .",
    "we find that there is a critical value of @xmath22 , represented by the monochrome boxes in figure  [ fig_crit ] , for a given combination of @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "the more rapidly rotating the matter is , the lower neutrino luminosity the shock revival requires .",
    "the green lines , connected with the black squares on the plane at @xmath34 , can be considered as the critical curve for non - rotational models , and the critical curve moves toward low @xmath33 as @xmath22 increases .",
    "therefore , it is confirmed that the rotation makes easy to explode in the 3d models .",
    "here , we notify that the critical curve at @xmath34 is located in somewhat higher @xmath33 than the curve given by more realistic simulations @xcite , although it agrees well with the curve obtained from the analytical study , taking neutrino - driven convection into account , in the almost same setups as ours @xcite .",
    "hence , we estimate that the critical surface , given by more sophisticated simulations , moves toward lower @xmath33 than the surface obtained in this study . the effect of grid resolution on the critical surface is also discussed in appendix [ appex_res ] .",
    "the time evolutions of the average shock radius are presented in figure  [ fig_rsh ] .",
    "they are calculated with the expansion coefficient @xmath35 in equation  ( [ eq_c ] ) multiplied by @xmath36 in equation  ( [ eq_k ] ) .",
    "rotation makes the shock radius enlarged , and more rapid rotation causes shock revival , even if the neutrino luminosity is not enough large to induce shock revival for non - rotational models . in the slow - rotational models for @xmath37 , the evolution of the shock wave reflect the features of flow patterns which are developed behind the shock wave for non - rotational models . in our previous study",
    ", the flow patterns are classified into sloshing motion ( sl ) , spiral motion ( sp ) , high - entropy bubbles ( bb ) , spiral motion with rising buoyant bubbles ( spb ) , and spiral motion with pulsating rotational velocity ( spp ) .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1 parameter indicates that sl and sp are caused by the growth of sasi , and bb arises as a result of neutrino - driven convection .",
    "the remaining two patterns , spb and spp , are considered as intermediate patterns of sp and bb .",
    "the abbreviated expressions of these patterns for non - rotational models are written in the bottom - right corners of the panels in figure  [ fig_rsh ] .",
    "more detailed characteristics of these non - rotational models except model b are described in our previous paper @xcite . the properties of irrotational model b are summarized in appendix [ appex_b ] .    figure  [ fig_nht ] shows the time evolutions of the net heating rate behind the shock wave .",
    "it is clear that the time variations of them are correlated with those of the shock radii in figure  [ fig_rsh ] .",
    "therefore , the neutrino heating mechanism is considered to work predominantly for the shock revival at least for the range of @xmath22 from 0.0 to 1.0 . as the speed of rotation is amplified",
    ", the net heating rates tend to increase with growing the shock radii .",
    "hence , it is obvious that the enhancement of neutrino heating can be involved by rotation .",
    "the evolution of the angular momentum in the flow behind the shock wave is shown in figure  [ fig_ang ] .",
    "the shocked matter has the angular momentum , which rotates in the same direction as the injected matter .",
    "the magnitude of the angular momentum is proportional to @xmath22 in the slow rotation phase , and it exponentially increases before shock revival .",
    "such amplifications of the angular momentum can induce the strong centrifugal force to the shocked matter , and they are supposed to change the characteristics of flow dynamics and neutrino heating / cooling .",
    "the two possibilities , how the shock revival can occur in the rotating cores , are considered here .",
    "one is the prolate explosion : shock expansion begins from the rotation axis at the onset of the explosion @xcite .",
    "the other is the oblate explosion : the preferred direction of explosion is perpendicular to the rotation axis @xcite . in the next section ,",
    "we focus on the expanding direction of the shock wave at the shock revival .",
    "figure  [ fig_ent ] presents the snapshots of the entropy contour maps on the meridian plane at @xmath38 for explosion models , when the average shock radii reach 300 km after shock revival .",
    "the left , middle , and right three panels show the entropy distributions for explosion models with rapid - rotation , slow - rotation , and non - rotation , respectively .",
    "the shock wave geometry has a strong unipolar nature in the two rapid rotation models ( figure  [ fig_ent ] ( a ) and ( d ) ) , and it has a dipolar nature in the other rapid rotation one ( figure  [ fig_ent ] ( g ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such directional characteristics are not clear in the non - rotational models , since high entropy bubbles are formed in various directions ( figure  [ fig_ent ] ( c ) , ( f ) , ( i ) ) . in the slow rotation models ,",
    "the weak unipolar explosions can be observed ( figure  [ fig_ent ] ( b ) , ( e ) , and ( h ) ) .",
    "although several realizations should be done for each model in order to confirm whether these directional properties are robust , it is obvious that the expanding directions of the shock waves are not specified parallel nor perpendicular to the rotation axis for the range of @xmath22 from 0.1 to 1.0 .",
    "the evolutions of the position angle , at which the shock wave is most extended , are shown in figure  [ fig_th ] .",
    "the black lines correspond to the results of non - rotational models .",
    "the position angles @xmath13 are varied , depending on the dominant flow patterns .",
    "once a rotational flow passes through the shock wave , the rotation axis of the flow behind the shock wave is fixed to be parallel to the polar axis in all cases , and the direction , at which the shock radius is most extended , prefers to be perpendicular to the rotation axis due to the centrifugal force . especially , the variances of @xmath13 from 90@xmath39 are small for @xmath40 when spiral motion ( sp ) is dominant for models d and g , while they are large if buoyant bubbles ( bb ) are generated for models b and e. when the intermediate patterns between sp and bb appear in the non - rotational models , the variances have moderate values for models a and h. the emergence of buoyant bubbles in the spiral flow for spb and the pulsating spiral motion for spp prevents the global rotation of matter in the gain region . hence , the centrifugal force , acting on the matter toward perpendicular to the rotation axis , can be reduced .",
    "furthermore , for models d and g , the expanding directions of the shock waves abruptly become unstable as @xmath22 increases .",
    "eventually , the directions , in which the shock waves are revived at first , are not confined neither along the rotation axis nor along the equatorial plane .",
    "why do the directions , in which the shock waves begin to run away at first , become unstable with increasing the rotation rates for models d and g ? to answer the question , we present @xmath41 as a function of @xmath22 for non - explosion models in figure  [ fig_kai ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the advection time to the growth time of convection , is a good indicator of the emergence of buoyant bubbles generated by neutrino - driven convection , where its criterion is @xmath42 @xcite . in this study , we calculate @xmath41 for each @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath41 is obtained from the mean flow averaged over the solid angle during the quasi - steady state , and how to calculate @xmath41 are elaborated in appendix [ appex_chi ] .",
    "we confirmed that buoyant bubbles emerge if @xmath43 .",
    "it is acceptable that the intermediate patterns have @xmath44 for spb and @xmath45 for spp , because in the former pattern buoyant bubbles can be clearly seen in the spiral flow , but not in the latter one .",
    "hence , we term the regions above and below @xmath46 as neutrino - driven convection and sasi , respectively",
    ". models d and g exist in the sasi region at @xmath47 .",
    "however , @xmath41 grows with increasing @xmath22 , and exceeds the line of @xmath46 at @xmath48 for model d and at @xmath49 for model g. then , the position angle @xmath13 , at which the shock wave is most extended , becomes unstable ( figure  [ fig_th ] ( d ) and ( g ) ) .",
    "here , we consider that the rapid rotation changes the flow dynamics for model d and g , i.e. the dominant instability is changed from sasi to neutrino - driven convection by rotation",
    ". the rapid rotation can induce the large centrifugal force , which can more effectively act on the flow with spiral motion than on it with buoyant bubbles , and then the shock radius is enlarged .",
    "the larger the shock radius is , the longer the advection time tend to be .",
    "hence , the accretion flow might acquire enough time to grow buoyant bubbles , and then the direction , in which the shock wave is revived at first , becomes unstable . on the other hand , for models a , b , h and e , @xmath41 keeps in the same region even if @xmath22 increases .",
    "so the time evolutions of @xmath13 do not show any drastic changes in their characteristics ( figure  [ fig_th ] ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) , and ( h ) ) .    finally , we refer to the difference between 2d and 3d .",
    "the time evolution of the averaged shock radius in 2d and 3d simulations for @xmath50 and 1.0@xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig_2d ]",
    ". there are three steps : ( 1 ) the 2d models without rotation from @xmath51 to @xmath52 s , ( 2 ) the 2d models with rotation from @xmath53 to @xmath54 s , and ( 3 ) the 3d models with rotation from @xmath55 to 2.0 s. we find that the explosions occur only in the 3d models at the parameters on the critical surface .",
    "this means that @xmath56 modes of neutrino - driven convection or sasi play an important role for rotational explosions at least around the critical surface .",
    "the centrifugal force , acting on the fragmented matter by hydrodynamical instability , further deforms the shock wave and enhances the neutrino heating behind the shock wave .",
    "it is also confirmed in more realistic simulations by other groups that 3d models with rotation is easier to explode than 2d ( * ? ? ?",
    "* t. takiwaki , private communication ) , but it has a possibility to depend on the parameters such as a rotation rate . in order to clarify the whole picture of this topic , more 3d parametric studies at the different parameters are interesting , and its detailed mechanism should be investigated by more realistic simulation with high resolution grids .",
    "in this paper , we investigated how rotation affects the shock revival for core - collapse supernovae under the situations in which non - axisymmetric hydrodynamical instabilities are developed . in order to obtain a critical surface , above which the shock wave can run away , in the three - dimensional parameter space @xmath57 , the rotating matter is injected from the outer boundary into the supersonic flow with increasing @xmath22 every 500 ms , where @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath22 are the mass accretion rate , the neutrino luminosity , and the normalized specific angular momentum , respectively .",
    "based on the results by @xcite , the range of the specific angular momentum is taken to be @xmath58 @xmath59 s@xmath19 in this study .",
    "we found that : ( 1 ) there is a critical value of @xmath22 for a given combination of @xmath31 and @xmath33 , ( 2 ) rotation makes a stalled shock wave easier to revive under the development of the three - dimensional hydrodynamical instabilities , ( 3 ) the neutrino heating mechanism works for the range of the specific angular momentum for @xmath58 @xmath26 s@xmath19 , ( 4 ) the direction , in which the shock wave is most extended , tends to be perpendicular to the rotation axis , ( 5 ) the dispersion of its direction from the equatorial plane depends on the dominant hydrodynamical instability of sasi and neutrino - driven convection , ( 6 ) the rapid rotation can change the dominant instability from sasi to neutrino - driven convection , ( 7 ) @xmath56 modes play an important role to the rotational explosions .    from ( 4 ) and",
    "( 5 ) , we estimate that the probability distributions of the expanding direction of the shock wave depend on the dominant hydrodynamical instability .",
    "the average direction is perpendicular to the rotation axis , while their dispersions tend to be small for sasi and large for neutrino - driven convection . in this study ,",
    "the neutrino - driven convection is more dominant than sasi at the shock revival due to ( 6 ) , but the dominant instability might be changed in the different parameters . furthermore ,",
    "if the time scale of flow motion driven by strong rotation is shorter than the growth times of these instabilities , the direction , in which the shock wave is extended at first , might change from perpendicular to the rotation axis to parallel to it .",
    "hence , the survey of the broader range of the parameters ( @xmath33 , @xmath31 , @xmath22 ) with a large number of realizations is interesting to understand the overall picture of the explosion of the rotating stars . in this study we assumed to be a constant mass accretion rate , a constant proto - neutron star mass , and a constant neutrino luminosity .",
    "the initial conditions are the steady solutions with a random perturbation .",
    "hence , the results should be confirmed in the context of the dynamical evolutions of the actual profiles of the supernova progenitors .",
    "moreover , the results should be also validated with more accurate treatment of neutrino transfer , which will be addressed by using boltzmann solver for neutrino radiation hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to know the neutrino signal and gravitational wave , emitted from the rotating matter behind the shock wave .",
    "these problems should be investigated in the future work .",

    "the time evolutions of normalized mode amplitudes , the orientations of the rotation axis , and the magnitudes of angular momentum are shown in figure [ fig_modelb ] .",
    "mode amplitude @xmath123 and parameter @xmath1 are defined in appendix [ appex_sph ] and [ appex_chi ] , respectively .",
    "model b have two patterns in the semi - nonlinear phase . depending on the initial perturbations which is made from the different seed of random number",
    ", either the formation of a spiral flow ( sp ) or the emergence of buoyant bubbles ( bb ) can be seen in the semi - nonlinear phase ( figure  [ fig_modelb ] ( a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "the oscillating growth of lower modes corresponds to the growth of spiral motion of the shock wave , while the monotonic increase of various modes indicates the shock deformation by rising buoyant bubbles .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath124 , which is obtained from the initial flow for model b , might be a critical value in our simulations . in the nonlinear phase ,",
    "the flow pattern turns into bb for both models b1 and b2 , judged from the unstable behavior of the rotation axis ( figure  [ fig_modelb ] ( d ) , ( e ) ) and the low angular momentum ( figure  [ fig_modelb ] ( g ) , ( h ) ) , where @xmath41 is about 5.0 .",
    "furthermore , we have done the resolution test for model b. flow patterns in the high resolution models are consistent with ones in the normal resolution models . in the semi - nonlinear phase",
    ", bb emerges in the middle resolution model ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_modelb](c ) ) , and sp appears in the high resolution model ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig_modelb](c ) ) . in the nonlinear phase",
    ", bb can be seen in both middle and high resolution models .",
    "although the ratio of mode amplitudes @xmath125 decrease with increasing resolution , the difference of resolution does not impact on flow patterns ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in this appendix we study whether the spatial resolution employed in this paper is good enough . for that purpose",
    "we compare simulations of both rotational and non - rotational models with different numbers of grid points .",
    "we change only angular resolutions because the radial grid spacings are already @xmath126 times finer than the angular ones and a further increase in the radial resolution will hardly affect the outcome .",
    "we first compare non - rotational models computed with @xmath127 ( fiducial ) , @xmath128 and @xmath129 mesh points . for none of these models we obtain shock revival .",
    "we then utilize the quasi - steady turbulences obtained at the end of the simulations for comparison .",
    "we present the kinetic - energy spectra of turbulence in figure [ fig_turb ] .",
    "following @xcite , we define the energy spectra @xmath130 as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the complex conjugation of the spherical harmonics of order @xmath133 given in equation ( [ eq_y ] ) , @xmath65 is the solid angle , @xmath62 is the density , and @xmath64 and @xmath134 are the polar and azimuthal components of velocity , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we use the spectra @xmath135 averaged over the quasi - steady phase as @xmath136 where @xmath92 is the integral time , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 being the start and end times of integration .",
    "@xmath137 is evaluated at the radial point , at which the local maximum value of @xmath138 is attained , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 denote the brunt - visl frequency and the radial velocity , respectively , defined in appendix [ appex_chi ] . in the figure [ fig_turb ] ,",
    "the injection scale of the turbulent energy is investigated , corresponding to the lowest @xmath141 in the inertial range in which @xmath137 is proportional to @xmath142 . from the results obtained by using the finest meshes",
    ", we infer that the turbulent energy is injected around @xmath143 , which is roughly same as the findings in some papers . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the injection scale is @xmath144 , and @xcite found that the scale is @xmath145 .",
    "we can see that the values of @xmath137 around injection scale agree well with each other among simulations with the different resolutions . at larger scales",
    "than their injection scales , they are still not very different qualitatively although the turbulent energy is slightly overestimated in the fiducial cases .",
    "in fact , the spectral peaks are obtained at @xmath146 or 2 for models d , g , and h ( fig .",
    "[ fig_turb ] ( c ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) ) , while they occur at @xmath147 for models a , b , and e ( fig .",
    "[ fig_turb ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( d ) ) .",
    "they reflect the fact that in the former models , coherent spiral and/or sloshing motions occur whereas buoyant bubbles are formed copiously in the latter , which is unaffected by the difference of resolution .",
    "as mentioned in the main body , sasi is thought to be in operation in the former case and the neutrino - driven convection is supposed to be dominant in the latter .",
    "we repeat , however , that the important point here is the fact that the large scale flow pattern , which is crucial for the enhancement of neutrino heating , is not changed by the increase of grid points . in this sense we can say that the grid we employed in this paper is good enough . it is admittedly true that the grid resolution is not sufficient to obtain the inertial range unambiguously . in the previous papers @xcite ,",
    "the kinetic - energy spectrum obeys the kolmogorov s law , @xmath148 , in the inertial range .",
    "@xcite , however , found that the spectrum has the power - law slope of -1 .",
    "recently , @xcite indicated by the high - resolution simulations that the spectra are consistent with a -1 power - law for @xmath149 and a -5/3 power - law for @xmath150 .",
    "hence , they considered that the injection point might be around @xmath151 .",
    "in figure [ fig_turb ] such features are barely seen with the higher resolutions .",
    "this is due to numerical viscosities , i.e. smaller - scale @xmath152 features are smeared out .",
    "it was reported by @xcite that the ram pressure of turbulent motions generated by the neutrino - driven convection may be large enough to enlarge a shock front .",
    "this is indeed the case , we may have overestimated the critical luminosity although the overestimation of turbulence power in large scales may somewhat compensate for this effect .",
    "next , we examine the rotational models with a higher resolution with @xmath129 grid points .",
    "we are concerned here with to what extent @xmath153 is affected .",
    "considering limited numerical resources , we inject the rotational flow with @xmath22=@xmath153 from the beginning for the higher resolution . if it does not lead to shock revival within 500ms , @xmath22 is increase at that point .",
    "figure[fig_rshg ] shows the evolutions of shock radius . in most of the cases , the shock - revival time",
    "is changed .",
    "it can be earlier or later , reflecting the stochastic nature of shock revival @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath153 is unchanged for all but two models .",
    "we find that @xmath153 is modified to a bit higher values for models e and h. it should be emphasized that the main conclusion that rotation lowers the critical luminosity is intact .",
    "figure  [ fig_thg ] shows the evolutions of the position angle , at which the shock is most expanded .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the shock revival tends to occur perpendicularly to the rotation axis regardless of resolution .",
    "moreover , the average deviations of @xmath13 from 90 deg are more or less the same between normal- and high - resolution models .",
    "we hence believe that the fiducial resolution of @xmath154 is justified also for rotational models .",
