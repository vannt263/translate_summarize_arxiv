    "from chromodynamics , i have inherited the prejudice that a decent quantum field theory must have a credible discrete approximation .",
    "being deep rooted , this prejudice resists counterexamples .",
    "in particular , regge calculus @xcite makes the geometric content of general relativity so clear that i find difficult to believe that a successful quantization scheme would not originate , or translate cleanly into this discretized approximation . and",
    "therefore , i am reluctant to add the quantization of regge calculus to the list of counterexamples , in spite of the modest success which the various attempts have achieved @xcite , and of the unquestionable fact that what progress there has been has been achieved ignoring this point of view",
    ".    i shall give a quick sketch of the recent work on canonical quantization of gravity , and a tentative critique of this work in the light of what i claim regge calculus would suggest , with side comments on the meaning of the results so far obtained .",
    "so , in spite of the rather generic title , i shall mention only a small fraction of the work going on .",
    "the idea that gravity should be treated as a connection theory underlies all the work i shall be considering , and this is where i shall begin ; the other main ingredient is the idea of the `` loop representation '' of rovelli and smolin , which has evolved into a theory of `` spin nets '' , and this will be discussed next , with a brief summary of the striking and very recent progress that has taken place . here",
    "i shall try and explain why i think that these results are spoilt by the imperfect link of the theory with the geometric content of general relativity .",
    "the crucial importance of this link will be illustrated using regge calculus as an example .",
    "if the aim is to formulate canonical general relativity as a some sort of gauge theory on 3space , we have various options@xcite .",
    "option ( 1 ) is a.d.m .",
    "geometrodynamics rewritten as a connection theory .",
    "one follows a.d.m . taking space slices @xmath0const . ,",
    "with a congruence @xmath1 related to the unit normal to the slice @xmath2 by @xmath3 , or @xmath4 ; however a.d.m .",
    "start with the einstein ",
    "hilbert action @xmath5 , while here one starts with an action @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the curvature 2form of the levi  civita connection @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) , and the further choice is made to partially fix the @xmath10 gauge freedom setting : @xmath11 this choice ( `` time gauge '' ) leaves invariance under local @xmath12 transformations , with @xmath13 space  like to provide a local frame on the slice .",
    "the pull  back of @xmath8 to the space slice gives the 3d l.c .",
    "connection @xmath14 , and the extrinsic curvature @xmath15 .",
    "as canonical variables we take the pair : @xmath16 they form a canonical pair , just like the @xmath17 variables of a.d.m . , because @xmath18 implies : @xmath19    the @xmath20 have curvature @xmath21 , and can be expressed in terms of @xmath22 ( and its inverse ) solving the 9 linear equations they satisfy : @xmath23 we need to impose the a.d.m .",
    "constraint , and to constrain @xmath24 to make sure that @xmath25 is symmetrical ; altogether : @xmath26}\\approx 0 \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad&&\\\\ { \\cal h}:={1\\over\\sqrt{q}}\\big(\\pi^{ab}\\pi_{ab}-{{\\textstyle{1\\over 2}}}\\pi^2-q\\;r\\big)=\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad & & \\\\ { 1\\over\\sqrt{\\det e } } ( 2e^{[a}_ie^{b]}_jk^j_ak^i_b+ \\epsilon_{ijk}e^{ia}e^{jb}r^i_{ab})\\approx 0 & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] everything can be rewitten in terms of @xmath27 matrices saturating @xmath28 indices with @xmath29 ; so for ex .",
    "the effect of local rotations becomes : @xmath30 there is nothing particularly new about any of this ; in particular @xmath24 fits into the scheme poorly , like an external field , and the connection is a derived quantity .",
    "option ( 2 ) is a shrewd variation on the theme devised by j. f. barbero@xcite , in a re  examination of the ashtekar@xcite formulation .    for some @xmath31 to be fixed",
    ", we can change our basic variables as follows : @xmath32 which _ is _ a canonical transformation , because @xmath33 so that : @xmath34 and all other poisson brackets vanish ( in particular , @xmath35 )",
    ". however unlike @xmath24 , @xmath36 transforms like an @xmath37 connection for any @xmath31 , and one can introduce @xmath38 derivatives and a curvature @xmath39 . using the properties of the levi  civita connection and a bit of algebra",
    "the constraints become : @xmath40}_jk^i_ak^j_b + \\ldots\\ \\approx\\ 0   & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots are terms proportional to @xmath41 and its derivatives .",
    "clearly the first two constraints are in an acceptable form , and the last one is not : the bit proportional to @xmath42 is a mess , the overall factor @xmath43 is unpleasant . as for this last point : we either learn to live with the factor , or we ignore it , absorbing it in the lagrange multiplier .",
    "the messy bit is more troublesome . the quickest way to get rid of it would be to take @xmath44",
    "this is ashtekar s original choice ( together with the idea of absorbing the factor @xmath43 in the lagrange multiplier)@xcite .",
    "the point is that there is much more to be said for this choice : it is ( or , one can convince oneself that it is ) the one choice that is geometrically and physically well motivated .",
    "in fact the connection @xmath45 is the pull  back to the space slice of the self  dual connection , and @xmath22 the pull  back of the self  dual product of two vierbeins : @xmath46    this definition of @xmath22 coincides with eq .",
    "( [ cii ] ) if we assume `` time gauge '' , eq .",
    "( [ ci ] ) ; for the definition of @xmath45 to coincide with eq .",
    "( [ cvii ] ) we have to assume `` time gauge '' and to impose explicitly that the connection @xmath47 is levi  civita , which follows if we add to the constraints the _ real _ part of the second eq .",
    "( [ civ ] ) as a brand new `` reality '' condition .",
    "the result is , i think , physically splendid , because we retain the full lorentz group as gauge group of the canonical theory , but technically appalling , because of the obvious complications implicit in the use of complex variables . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath48 which now occurs in the poisson brackets eq .",
    "( [ cix ] ) puts all simple minded quantizations on collision course with the desire to have the operators corrsponding to @xmath22 hermitean .",
    "more particularly , i have not found a way round this difficulty , simple minded or not .",
    "the alternative that has become most popular is to take @xmath49 , the `` barbero connection '' .",
    "i would like to claim that the trouble with this choice is that the connection has no obvious geometric meaning , and that there is nothing special about the value 1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath31 can be anything , and i shall leave it arbitrary ( but real @xmath50 ) in the following . in euclidean",
    "( + + + + ) gravity the second term of @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath52 , and the choice @xmath53 _ is _ natural , just like @xmath54 was `` natural '' for the ( -+++ ) signature , but that s not saying much , unless somehow we learn to `` wick  rotate '' the theory . for this possibility @xcite see later .",
    "there are at least two smart ways out of the inconvenience that @xmath24 is a complicated function of @xmath55 and @xmath22 ( so that the expression of @xmath51 is messy ) , which come by roundabout arguments devised by t. thiemann@xcite .",
    "i begin by listing some identities ; let @xmath56 be nice test functions on @xmath57 , and @xmath58&:=&\\int_\\sigma{f\\over\\sqrt{\\det e } } \\epsilon_{ijk}e^{ia}e^{jb } f^{(\\beta ) k}_{ab}d^3x\\nonumber\\\\ v[h]&:=&\\int_\\sigma h\\sqrt{\\det e}d^3x \\label{cxii } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then one can work out the following remarkable poisson brackets : @xmath59\\ , , \\ ,",
    "v[h]\\right\\ } & = & 2\\beta^2\\kappa\\int_\\sigma f\\,h\\,e^{ia}k^i_ad^3x = \\nonumber\\\\ & : = &   2\\beta^2\\kappa^2 t[fh ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\left\\ { t[f]\\ , , \\ , e^{ia}(x)\\right\\ } & = & + f(x)e^{ia}(x)\\nonumber\\\\ \\",

    "v[h]\\right\\ } & = & { \\beta\\kappa h\\over 4\\sqrt{\\det e}}\\,\\epsilon_{abc}\\epsilon_{ijk}e^{ia}e^{jb } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i shall ignore possible problems with boundary terms , write simply @xmath60,\\ t:=t[1 ] , \\",
    "h^e:={\\cal h}^e[1]$ ] , and summarize the above as : @xmath61 one use of these identities could be to rewrite @xmath51 in the ( possibly more manageable ) form : @xmath62 this is the line followed by t. thiemann in @xcite , and claimed to be a runaway success .",
    "a more fancy approach starts from the observation that the hamiltonian evolution induced by some @xmath63 on a function @xmath64 on phase space is given by the map : @xmath65 which preserves poisson brackets etc . ;",
    "furthermore , from eq.([cxv ] ) : @xmath66 one may say that this relation shows explicitly that the value of @xmath31 does not matter , since it can be changed at will ( which is the point i am trying to make ) .",
    "more boldly , that it gives us a way to go from the barbero to the ashtekar connection , setting @xmath67 if we had @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this idea of a `` wick rotation '' is striking , but i find it very difficult to articulate . in particular , i find difficult to understand how the transformation brings about a change of ( gauge ) symmetry group .",
    "i nevertheless regard this as the most promising clue to the construction of a satisfactory quantum theory within this set of ideas .",
    "to quantize the theory we may use the connection representation , in which states are functionals of @xmath68 , and @xmath69 the important states turn out to be `` spin net states '' , which are an obvious generalization of wilson loops .",
    "take for ex .",
    "the net in the picture , which has 5 vertices and 10 lines , and lives in a space with a connection @xmath55 ; assign to each line @xmath70 an orientation , hence a `` transporter '' @xmath71 , and a spin @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 ; assign to each vertex @xmath74 an @xmath37 invariant tensor @xmath75 , and we shall have that : @xmath76 is gauge invariant .",
    "if @xmath77 , and we indicate by @xmath78 the haar measure , these states form a ( smallish ) hilbert space with the scalar product : @xmath79 ashtekar and collaborators have discovered and emphasized again and again ( see e.g.@xcite ) that if one considers all possible nets , then the ( very large ) set of these states is _ dense _ in the hilbert space of gauge invariant functionals of @xmath80 . in this sense eq.([sii ] ) induces a measure @xmath81 in this space .",
    "the gauge invariant functionals of @xmath82 which might represent physical states are invariant under diffeomorphism .",
    "given one such state @xmath83 $ ] , for every spin net state @xmath84 $ ] we can in principle calculate its `` loop transform '' : @xmath85\\;\\psi [ a^{(\\beta ) } ] \\label{siii}\\ ] ] that will represent the same state , and is diffeomorphic invariant it depends only on the structure of the net and on our assigments of spins and invariant tensors .",
    "this is the latest incarnation of the `` loop representation '' idea of rovelli and smolin@xcite .",
    "this form goes particularly well with the idea of the `` weave''@xcite : that the world that ( we think ) we know is likely to be described by states @xmath86 with support on huge , immensely complicated and fine meshed nets , in fact with mesh sizes of the order of the planck length .    if we keep in mind the weave idea , it is quite sensible to look at net states to find the spectrum of the operators that correspond to the area of a surface @xmath87 and to the volume of a region @xmath88 , and to study the operator form of the constraints .    very briefly : if the surface @xmath87 intersects a subset @xmath89 of lines of the net , does not touch the vertices , has no line lying on it , carefully regularizing the operator ( _ first _ taking the square root , _ then _ removing the regulator ) , one finds@xcite : @xmath90 if the region @xmath88 contains a subset @xmath91 of vertices of the net , one finds@xcite by a similar procedure that a suitably regularized volume operator @xmath92 mixes the states @xmath93 with coefficients proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "this operator can be diagonalized@xcite , and has a complicated , but discrete spectrum . before going further",
    ", it is important to notice that nothing works for the theory based on the ashtekar connection @xmath54 : all operators have the wrong hermiticity ; on this , see later .",
    "however , i claim that the discrete spectra one gets for areas and volume at this stage be interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of space , because of the arbitrariness of @xmath31 ; we are faced with a `` @xmath31 crisis '' . unless we find some good reason to fix @xmath31 , the commutation relations eq.([cix ] )",
    "will be unable to fix the scale of the theory .",
    "my feeling is that this requires a group larger than @xmath37 ; a bit like in good old current algebra . a larger group may come from the need to implement the `` wick rotation '' , whether interpreted as a passage from the euclidean to the minkowskian or from the barbero to the ashtekar connection",
    "i do not know .",
    "alternatively , it may be that looking at the wheeler de witt equation @xmath95 , following thiemann s work @xcite , we shall find that solutions exist only for particular values of @xmath31 . given the way in which eq.([cxvi ] ) depends on @xmath31 , this is actually rather likely ; but then , it m ay be just another way of saying the same thing . at the same time , if it were true it would be splendid : because we would have derived the discreteness of space from dynamics , and not from a kinematic fiddle .",
    "thiemann s work @xcite on the hamiltonian constraint is the latest thing .",
    "it is a massive and difficult piece of work , so that my comments , based on a very limited understanding , are obviously very tentative .",
    "the main effort is aimed at defining a satisfactory quantum operator corresponding to @xmath96 $ ] , eq.([cxii ] ) , from which , in view of eq.([cxiii],[cxv ] ) the rest follows ( more or less ) .",
    "a regularization is obtained noticing that for a vertex @xmath74 of a net and a choice of three ( outgoing ) lines , say @xmath97 , adding lines @xmath98 ( see the figure ) , in the nave limit @xmath99 one has : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the coordinate volume of the tetrahedron shown .",
    "the action of the quantum @xmath102 $ ] on net states is defined summing over all vertices and all choices of three lines the corresponding operator : @xmath103\\cdot \\psi_{\\underline n}= \\sum_{v,\\{ijk\\ } } { 4\\over 3i\\beta\\hbar\\kappa}f(v)\\cdot \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad & & \\nonumber\\\\ \\cdot\\sum_{i , j , k}\\epsilon^{ijk}{\\hbox{tr}}(\\,g_ig_{ij}g_j^{-1}\\;g_k\\,[g_k^{-1 } , \\hat v ] ) \\cdot\\psi_{\\underline n }   & & \\label{svii } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is only the beginning , the definition is sharpened and modified several times en route .",
    "i understand that this summer it has been the object of intensive discussions by lots of specialists at the esi workshop , and no doubt you will hear more and in more detail about it .",
    "the pattern i have described so far occurs again if you try and discretize the theory , except that there are more variants : from the variable mesh discretizations of the groups that solve problems in the classical theory numerically ( an industry in rapid expansion ) , to emulatations of lattice gauge theory or to the theory of random triangulations .",
    "i shall restrict myself drastically , and try to keep close in spirit to the original regge idea .",
    "divide space in tetrahedra with a flat inside : the natural variables corresponding to the @xmath22 would be the areas of the triangles , oriented outwards with respect to a frame local to the tetrahedron : @xmath104 the area square of a triangle will be @xmath105 , and of course tetrahedra must close ; for the tetrahedron @xmath106 , labeling each triangle with the number of the vertex opposite , this gives the constraint : @xmath107 the volume square of the tetrahedron will be : @xmath108 the variables @xmath87 must be paired with variables @xmath109 that link the frame attached to tetrahedron @xmath110 to the one of its neighbour @xmath111 across the triangle , with the basic condition that the triangle looks the same from both sides : @xmath112    if @xmath109 is a rotation , we will discover the local geometry of our space going round an edge , from tetrahedron to tetrahedron , until we get back : then if we are not in the same frame we started from , we conclude that space is curved .",
    "changes of the frames , i.e. local rotations , are `` gauge '' transformations , which translate eq.([cvi ] ) to : @xmath113 an explicit parametrization for the triangle @xmath114 would be : @xmath115 with @xmath116 ; the angle @xmath117 is arbitrary at this stage .",
    "suppose that we are given the lengths of all edges , like in regge s original scheme for `` general relativity without coordinates '' : then we are in a riemannian space , and we have conditions for the triangles that share an edge ; for the edge ( 12 ) they read : @xmath118\\ , , \\,g^{-1}_{ab}\\;[s_{3a},s_{4a}]\\;g_{ab}]=0   \\label{rv}\\ ] ] i omit the details : the point is that from these relations we can calculate all the angles @xmath117 , and for the curvature around the edge @xmath119 we find : @xmath120 curvature is essentially the `` defect angle '' in the rotation ; the connection is levi  civita .    but what can we make of the @xmath24 ? to make the connection `` dynamic '' , we must give up eq.([rv ] ) , and therefore ( [ rvi ] ) , and leave the angles @xmath117 arbitrary , because that is the only place where the extrinsic curvature can go .",
    "omitting details again , by various plausibility arguments , and insisting that in the limit eq.([cix ] ) is recovered , one finds for the liouville form @xmath121 ( the @xmath122 bit of the action ) and for the poisson brackets : @xmath123 in the explicit parametrization eq.([riv ] ) each triangle contributes to the liouville form : @xmath124 i have not tried to write the constraints for real @xmath31 .",
    "the idea of squeezing in dynamics by fiddling @xmath117 may appear ugly and artificial , but it is the sense of the `` barbero connection '' .",
    "the ashtekar choice makes much more sense : one replaces the @xmath117 we calculated above with a complex variable : @xmath125 so that @xmath126 is promoted to a lorentz transformation , with rapidity @xmath127 , that links the different inertial frames attached to tetrahedra @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "one may say that this is physically well motivated , and follows straight from the principle of equivalence .",
    "however , extending the gauge transformations eq.([riii ] ) from @xmath37 to @xmath128 inevitably creates complications : we have to impose explicitly that within a tetrahedron @xmath129 is real and positive definite , and eq.([rv ] ) has to be modified .",
    "on the other hand we know that the hamiltonian constraint simplifies to the @xmath130 form , for which it is not difficult to guess discrete versions , for ex .",
    ": @xmath131 f_{ij})_t\\ ; \\approx\\ ;   0   \\label{rx}\\ ] ] in words : for each tetrahedron , the sum of the lengths of the edges times the corresponding defect angle must vanish .",
    "this comes about because for the edge @xmath119 of a we can see that @xmath132 in practice to make any use of eq.([rx ] ) , which is certainly not the only expression possible , we must approximate @xmath133 with some function of @xmath88 , e.g.@xmath134 . the same or a similar expression can be used for the @xmath130 part of the hamiltonian constraint for real @xmath31 .",
    "it is unfortunate that , as far as i can see , the regularized form used by thiemann is just about the least natural in this scheme .",
    "this is because , at the first step one finds , for ex . :",
    "@xmath135 a rather uncooperative expression ; or , said more generally , because thiemann s tetrahedra live in a lattice dual to the regge lattice ) the volume operator @xmath136 acts on the vertices of the net , that correspond to regge tetrahedra , while @xmath137 is the volume of a tetrahedron in the dual lattice . ]",
    ", in which to each of our triangles corresponds a line , and to each tetrahedron a ( 4valent ) vertex .",
    "now for quantization . at first sight , from what i said about nets , it would appear that discretization , and regge calculus in particular , offers the perfect tool ; in fact , i became interested in regge calculus because i was trying with spin nets .",
    "spin nets naturally live in the dual of the regge lattice .",
    "one can immediately envisage putting on a ( small ) computer a finite , simple lattice like a five tetrahedra division of @xmath138 . in a real @xmath37 formulation",
    "the quantization of areas follows directly from eq.([rviii ] ) : the area variable @xmath139 is conjugate to an angle @xmath117 .",
    "this is just the way t hooft argued in his discretized 2 + 1 gravity@xcite , but with a very refined argument to wick - rotate the theory .",
    "however , the direct use of the ashtekar connection for quantization is made impossible by a muddle over the measure .",
    "i shall explain this in detail because i still hope that the muddle has a simple solution that i can not see because of some selective blindness .",
    "one can see what the problem is quite simply by writing the quantum version of eq.([rvii ] ) for @xmath44 : @xmath140 = -\\kappa\\,\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat{s}^k\\ ; \\quad [ \\hat{g},\\hat{s}^i ] = -\\kappa\\,\\tau_i\\,\\hat{g }    \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath141 = 0\\ ] ] so that if @xmath142 , the ( holomorphic ) generator of the left  regular representation of @xmath128 .",
    "the problem is that now there is no way to juggle the measure to make @xmath143 hermitean ; worse , @xmath144 is negative , with eigenvalues @xmath145 .",
    "of course one did expect troubles : there are always troubles with non  compact groups , e.g. in 2 + 1 gravity@xcite , and even linearized gravity turns out to be quite tricky@xcite ; in qed the scalar product is well defined only for gauge invariant states .",
    "so the cure should come from considering the hamiltonian constraint ; in an interesting analysis of the linearized case@xcite the suggestion is that one should gauge fix it . in our case , the idea of `` wick rotation '' seems much more attractive , but notice that in any case it depends on solving the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the idea@xcite is that one can apply to this transformation the formalism of `` coherent state transformations '' developed by b.c .",
    "hall@xcite , suitably generalized .",
    "these are isometries between hilbert spaces on e.g. @xmath37 and on its complexification @xmath128 ; in the simplest case one defines heat kernels on the two groups by : @xmath146 ( notice that @xmath147 is an elliptic operator , but not the casimir ) .",
    "then the transformation @xmath148 : @xmath149 maps functions on @xmath37 which are @xmath150 with the measure @xmath151 to functions on @xmath128 which are holomorphic and @xmath150 with the measure @xmath152 . the map can be proved to be invertible and isometric , i.e. @xmath153 this seems to be just what we need , but the connection with the `` wick rotation '' is still to be understood .",
