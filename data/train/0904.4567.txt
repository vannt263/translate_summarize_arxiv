    "it has been suggested that some of phenomena of strongly interacting systems can be described by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "while the relevance of the gauge / string duality to the qcd has been much discussed in the context of heavy ion collisions @xcite and hadron physics , its relevance to the electron system is rather new and still an open issue .",
    "however , testing the applicability with a model in the bulk and the phenomena at the boundary is a very exciting possibility . in this context",
    ", it has been attempted to use the ads / cft correspondence to describe certain condensed matter systems such as the quantum hall effect @xcite , nernst effect @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , and fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a model of a strongly coupled system which develops superconductivity was suggested based on the holography , which is an abelian higgs model in 3 + 1 dimensional anti - de sitter(ads ) spacetime . in this model a complex scalar field , as a dual of the `` cooper pair '' operator at the boundary , is introduced whose vacuum expectation value is the order parameter of the superconductivity .",
    "the symmetry breaking was induced by considering the negative mass squared of the scalar field . in ads",
    "spacetime , the negative mass squared is allowed due to the breitenlohner - freedman(bf ) bound . in this case , the dual operator coupled to the scalar field at the boundary has a weight @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "recall that for a scalar field in ads@xmath3 spacetime , @xmath4 .",
    "the cases with @xmath5 and 3 were considered in ref .",
    "the hydrodynamic nature was studied in a theory with large conformal operators , @xmath6 , in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in 2 + 1 dimensions , a fermion bilinear ( cooper pair ) has naive dimension 2 , therefore its dual scalar field should have a tachyonic mass , leading to the instability for the symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the anomalous dimension is usually non - zero and can be large , so we are forced to ask what happens if the mass squared is positive .",
    "another motivation is the neutron superfluidity in the neutron star .",
    "since the neutron consists of three quarks , its creation operator is a composite operator with high conformal dimensions and so is the cooper pair of the neutrons , naively @xmath7 for the pair .",
    "again , one is led to the question of the positive mass squared case .",
    "when the scalar field has a positive mass squared , one may expect that the mechanism of the symmetry breaking is also removed .",
    "however , in the presence of the matter , there is a density driven instability leading to the symmetry breaking as the effective mass of the complex boson in flat spacetime is given by @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "in warped spacetime , we can still expect the same mechanism at work .",
    "this is already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite from the fact that the fluctuation of the scalar field has an effective mass @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electrostatic potential whose value at the boundary is the chemical potential .",
    "notice that the regularity requires @xmath12 at the horizon . as a consequence , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) goes to zero at the horizon in spite of the divergence of @xmath13 . on the other hand , near the boundary",
    ", @xmath13 is zero hence it eliminates the effect of the chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the density effect should be less effective than the flat space case , and it is not clear whether the density driven symmetry breaking mechanism is still working . the present work is to address this question in detail .",
    "in fact , our results show that for a small positive mass squared , the result is not much different from the negative case studied in refs .",
    "however , as the mass squared increases , the phase space folds so that two very close boundary conditions can give completely opposite states : one symmetry broken state , and another symmetric state .",
    "the specific heat is one of the experimental observables for superconductors , and it has two interesting limits . at a temperature far below the transition temperature @xmath14 ,",
    "at which the superconductivity disappears , the specific heat is exponentially small due to the pairing gap , while it exhibits a discontinuity very near @xmath14 .",
    "we calculate the specific heat with various @xmath0 to see if large conformal dimensions change the properties , focusing on the normalized magnitude of the discontinuity .",
    "then we compare our results with experimentally observed numbers of some real materials .",
    "finally we calculate the electrical conductivity for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we use the abelian higgs model in ads@xmath3 schwarzschild black hole background to study the holographic superconductors .",
    "the action of the model is given by @xmath17 where the bulk maxwell field strength is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a charged complex scalar field .",
    "we work with the following ( d+1)-dimensional background metric : ds^2 = ( - f(z ) dt^2 + + d x ^2 ) , f(z ) = 1 - ( ) ^d , where the horizon is at @xmath20 .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is given as @xmath21 note that we will work in the probe limit : the maxwell field and the scalar field do not give any back - reaction to the background metric .",
    "here we take the form of the bulk scalar field as @xmath22 and consider the gauge transformation @xmath23 .",
    "then the equations of motion for static and translational invariant fields of interest read @xmath24 to solve the equations of motion , we specify appropriate boundary conditions as follows : at the horizon , @xmath25 and at the boundary , i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 we will fix the chemical potential @xmath9 and thus work in the grand canonical ensemble . for the boundary value of the scalar field @xmath28 , we will choose @xmath29 . when both @xmath30 and @xmath31 are normalizable modes we need to make a choice of either @xmath32 or @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "as we increase @xmath0 , @xmath34 increases and @xmath30 becomes non - normalizable mode , which corresponds to a source term . we choose @xmath29 to impose the source free condition which is necessary to study the spontaneous symmetry breaking rather than induced breaking .",

    "( [ eomz ] ) are invariant under the re - scaling : z & = & z_0 |z , a_t = , with @xmath28 fixed . at the boundary ,",

    "there have been many studies on the properties of the holographic superconductors in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "we note that in the literatures , @xmath0 has been assumed to be negative to guarantee the symmetry breaking and the scalar field condensate . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the massless case was also considered .",
    "in this section , we extend the previous studies on the holographic superconductors by considering the bulk scalar field with the positive mass , @xmath15 . as in the @xmath35 cases , we need to solve the coupled equations of motion in eq .",

    "the obtained behavior of the conductivity was rather universal against varying @xmath0 .    finally , we remark that to establish the instability of the folded region in the phase space more reliably , one needs to study the back reaction of the scalar field to the geometry .",

    "if the scalar field were absent , we know that the charge is not supposed to be larger than the critical value when considering a fixed mass . here , the coupling of the gauge field and the scalar field makes things fuzzy .",

    "<S> we observe a discontinuity in the specific heat at the transition point and compare our results with experimentally observed numbers . the electrical conductivity for various @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is also calculated . </S>"
