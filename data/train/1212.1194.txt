    "the exchange of energy in cells is mostly mediated by atp ( adenosine triphosphate ) molecules .",
    "such molecules are produced in several processes in an eukaryotic cell , but the principal source of atp is typically the oxidative phosphorylation process which takes place in mitochondria . the mitochondrion is an organelle with two membranes , having , therefore , two distinct bulk regions : the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix . in the inner membrane ,",
    "there are plenty of protein transporters and ionic channels , some of which execute an active transport leading to a gradient of some ions and molecules @xcite .",
    "the metabolic cascade that leads to the production of atp in the mitochondrion starts in the cytoplasm . at first",
    ", glucose is transported from the extracellular medium into the cytoplasm by glut transporters .",
    "it is then converted in glucose-6-phosphate ( g6p ) by the enzyme hexokinase .",
    "g6p is then converted in pyruvate in a process called glycolysis , in which there is a net production of two atp molecules .",
    "the pyruvate produced is transported into the mitochondrion ( to the mitochondrial matrix ) and is metabolized in a series of oxidation - reduction reactions in the citric acid cycle leading to the production of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad and flavin adenine dinucleotide fad .",
    "these electron donor molecules are oxidized in the complexes i to iv present in the inner mitochondrial membrane .",
    "these reactions lead to the activation of a proton pump , creating a ph gradient between the inter membrane space and the matrix .",
    "the protons pumped into the intermembrane space return to the matrix through a transporter that uses their energy to catalyze the conversion of adp ( adenosine diphosphate ) into atp .",
    "the atp produced in the mitochondria is then transported to the cytoplasm by the atp / adp exchanger @xcite .",
    "the kinetic aspects of the processes involved in the atp production in mitochondria are rather intricate .",
    "this issue was addressed by magnus and keizer ( mk ) , who introduced in the series of papers @xcite a theoretical kinetic model for atp production in mitochondria based on the known biophysical properties of the enzymes and transporters involved in the process .",
    "in fact , the mk model was built by considering electrical activity and cytosolic calcium handling in insulin - secreting pancreatic @xmath3-cells .",
    "the model consists basically in a set of equations describing the dynamics of the citric acid cycle , the proton pump , and the inner mitochondrial membrane transporters of atp and calcium .",
    "the mk model is effectively based on first biophysical principles and provides a very detailed and accurate description of the processes considered to be important for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation . however , it is also a rather complex model with cumbersome equations , preventing a systematic mathematical study of its main dynamical and physiological properties .",
    "a simplification of the mk model aiming to retain its main dynamical properties was introduced recently by bertram , pedersen , luciani , and sherman ( bpls ) in @xcite .",
    "the bpls model incorporates some refinements introduced by cortassa _",
    "_ in @xcite for the description of the atp production in cardiac cells .",
    "in fact , bpls model can be considered as an approximation of the cortassa _",
    "_ s model instead of the original mk one . as we will see",
    ", this was probably the origin of some inaccuracies in the bpls equations .",
    "as in the original mk model , the mitochondrial atp production in the bpls model is governed by four dynamical variables , namely the potential drop in the inner membrane @xmath4 and the mitochondrial concentrations of : reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh , adenosine diphosphate adp , and calcium ca@xmath5 .",
    "the mitochondrial concentrations of pyridine and adenine nucleotides are assumed to be conserved @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the total mitochondrial concentration of the respective nucleotides . the balance of the pertinent fluxes and reactions yields to the following dynamical equations for the mitochondrial variables @xmath10 where @xmath11 the derivation and meaning of the fluxes presented in the right - handed sides of eq .",
    "( [ e1])-([e4 ] ) are rather involved .",
    "the main details and the pertinent references can be found , for instance , in the bpls paper @xcite .",
    "we have checked carefully the derivation of each of these fluxes and we have found out some inaccuracies in the bpls expressions for the adenine nucleotide translocator rate @xmath0 and for the calcium uniporter rate @xmath1 . as we will see , some of these problems probably have originated in the transcription of the original mk equations to the cortassa _",
    "et al . _ s model .    in the present paper , we propose some enhanced approximations in the bpls framework for the fluxes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and analyze some of the dynamical properties of eqs .",
    "( [ e1])-([e4 ] ) .",
    "we show , in particular , that for physiologically acceptable ranges of mitochondrial respiration inputs , namely the cytosolic concentration of calcium @xmath2 and the substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate fbp , the bpls equations have a unique physiologically acceptable attractor fixed point , as one would indeed expect for any model compatible with homeostasis .",
    "exhaustive numerical explorations indicate that the bpls model is indeed globally stable , reinforcing its relevance to physiological quantitative studies , despite its simplicity when compared to the mk original model .",
    "we determine , in the stationary regime , the dependence on constant respiration inputs @xmath2 and fbp of the four mitochondrial variables considered in the model .",
    "as in the original bpls model , we observe here qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior for low and high concentrations of @xmath2 and/or fbp .",
    "we detect , moreover , a non - stationary effect which could be , in principle , physiologically interesting : the inertia of the system tends to increase considerably for high concentrations of cytosolic calcium and fbp , _",
    "i.e. _ , some response times of the model tend to increase considerably for high respiration inputs @xmath2 and fbp .",
    "in particular , the larger the concentrations of @xmath2 and/or fbp , the larger the necessary time to attain homeostasis .",
    "we will focus here in the problems we found for the bpls expressions for the adenine nucleotide translocator rate @xmath0 and for calcium uniporter rate @xmath1 , since all the other quantities appearing in ( [ e1])-([e4 ] ) were checked to be correct and accurate for physiological ranges of variables and parameters .",
    "the mk expression for the former is ( see eq . ( 16 ) and table 4 of @xcite ) @xmath12 the precise meaning of all the quantities presented in this formula can be found in @xcite , and in the bpls paper @xcite as well .",
