    "in the past three decades the cooling history of neutron stars was investigated by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations account for non - isothermal interior , as well as for general relativistic effects . nevertheless , as far as we know , all investigations assumed spherical symmetry of geometry and temperature distribution .    as it was pointed out by miralles et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the effect of rapid rotation on the cooling of neutron stars can be as important as general relativistic effects , whereas the effect of slow rotation should be negligible .",
    "although the assumption of slow rotation holds for most of the known pulsars , there exist a couple of millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ) , for which rotation should yield a rather different cooling behaviour .",
    "these millisecond pulsars are generally located in binary systems .",
    "it may however be expected that young , isolated millisecond pulsars can be detected in the near future , too .",
    "a candidate might be the supernova remnant of sn1987a .",
    "although the observed neutrino burst lasting for ten seconds indicates that a neutron star was formed in the supernova , there is no evidence for the continued existence of it ( s. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , the neutron star can still be hidden by the surrounding matter , and the continued observations might reveal a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "the aim of this letter is to study the effect of non - spherical geometry on the cooling of neutron stars . as far as we know , this is the first investigation of rotational effects beyond the isothermal core ansatz ( @xcite ) and also the first completely two dimensional simulation of neutron star cooling .",
    "the letter is organized as follows : we first derive the general relativistic equations of thermal evolution and describe the numerical method in sect . [",
    "sec : eq ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] , we apply the two dimensional cooling code to static and rotating neutron star models based on a relativistic equation of state including hyperonic degrees of freedom . finally , we summarize our conclusions and discuss further improvements and applications of the current work in sect .

    "already a few seconds after the formation of a neutron star in a supernova , its interior settles down into catalysed , degenerate matter .",
    "the subsequent cooling involves only thermal processes and does not change the space time geometry .",
    "however , the structure of a neutron star depends on the rotational velocity , which generally decreases as the star loose angular momentum , e.g. due to emission of magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "since the time scale for reaching hydrostatic equilibrium is much smaller than the time scale for the variation of angular velocity ( s. @xcite , p. 239 ) , one can treat the evolution of a neutron star in quasi stationary approximation . though the partial transformation of rotational energy into thermal energy may considerably change the cooling behaviour of a neutron star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and also the variation of space time geometry might have an effect on it , we study here , as a first step , the simplest case of constant angular velocity .",
    "the stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotic flat metric in quasi isotropic coordinates reads @xmath2 where the metric coefficients @xmath3 are functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 only .",
    "the metric coefficients are determined by the einstein equation ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 , and the energy - momentum conservation @xmath8 .",
    "the obtained elliptic differential equations ( @xcite ) are solved via a finite difference scheme ( @xcite ) once , before the cooling simulation starts .    in the case of uniform rotation , @xmath9 , considered here , the equations for thermal evolution are ( @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 denote the heat flux 3-vector in the comoving frame , @xmath13 the heat capacity , @xmath14 the neutrino emissivity , and @xmath15 the heat conductivity .",
    "the partial radial and angular differentials are abbreviated by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "thermal equilibrium is described by @xmath18 .    at the surface of the neutron star the heat flux @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "is determined by the normal heat flux @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath4-coordinate of the surface .",
    "@xmath21 is taken from a non - magnetic photosphere model which describes the temperature gradient in the region between @xmath24 and the star s surface ( e.g. @xcite ) . in these models",
    "@xmath25 depends on the temperature at the density @xmath24 and on the surface gravity @xmath26    the parabolic differential equations obtained after inserting eqs . and into eq . are solved via an implicit finite difference scheme by using a alternating direction implicit method .",
    "this yields a non - linear equation system which can be solved iteratively .",
    "the obtained linear equation systems have tridiagonal coefficient matrices which can be inverted rather fast .",
    "the correctness of the two dimensional code was checked by comparing the outcome of it with simple , analytically solvable models and with the results of the one dimensional code described by schaab et  al .",
    "we consider a superfluid neutron star model basing on the relativistic hartree - fock equation of state labelled rhf8 in huber et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which accounts for hyperonic degrees of freedom .",

    "it is possible to distinguish three epochs of evolution . in the first epoch @xmath40  yr",
    ", large temperature gradients occur in the interior of the neutron star .",
    "radial temperature gradients were already found in one dimensional simulations ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in rotating neutron stars , azimuthal temperature gradients , which cause transverse heat flow , @xmath41 , exist , too .",
    "the polar temperature is by 16% or 63% higher than the equatorial temperature for the models rotating with @xmath42 and @xmath30 , respectively ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : deviation ] ) .",
    "after about 100  yr the cooling wave reaches the surface and the interior becomes isothermal , @xmath18 the temperature deviation between pole and equator is now mainly caused by the smaller surface gravity @xmath39 at the equator , since @xmath43 for fixed internal temperature . whereas the temperature deviation is still high in the case of nearly kepler rotation ( @xmath44% ) , it almost disappears for the model with @xmath42 ( @xmath45% ) .",
    "after about @xmath46  yr , the photon surface radiation dominates the cooling .",
    "the temperature distribution tends to a new equilibrium with @xmath47 , on a timescale of @xmath1  yr .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the temperature at the inner boundary of the photosphere at @xmath24 .",
    "since the heat capacity is only weakly temperature dependent for @xmath49  k in the outer crust , the surface temperature tends to an isothermal state , whereas the temperature in the outer crust varies with the surface gravity .",
    "this behaviour is accompanied by the breakdown of the scaling @xmath50 of the surface temperature with surface gravity for small surface temperatures . however , as one can see by comparing the thin dashed curve , which assumes @xmath51 over the whole temperature range , with the thick curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : deviation ] , this is only a small effect and can not explain the tendency of the surface temperature fraction to unity .    besides these effects on the angular dependency of the temperature , rotation has also a net effect on cooling in the intermediate epoch .",
    "this effect is caused by the reduction of the neutrino luminosity , which sensitively depends on the central density .",
    "a further effect of rotation on cooling of neutron stars is the lengthening of the thermal diffusion time by several hundred years .",
    "additionally the drop of the surface temperature is smoother in the case of rotation ( see also @xcite ) , since the cooling wave reaches the polar region earlier than the equator . during the cooling wave is reaching the different surface regions",
    ", the fraction @xmath52 falls below unity ( s. fig .",
    "[ fig : deviation ] ) .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the effect of non - spherical geometry on the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "our general finding is that rapid rotation plays a significant role in the thermal evolution .",
    "this role is particularly important in the early epoch , when the star s interior is not yet isothermal .",
    "it is precisely this epoch , when even isolated pulsars might rotate very rapidly .",
    "the angular dependent radial and transverse heat flow cause azimuthal temperature gradients in the interior of the star and thus also at the surface .",
    "the polar surface temperature is by up to 63% higher than the equatorial temperature .",
    "the simulation of this non - isothermal epoch can not be performed with isothermal core approaches or one dimensional codes .    in the intermediate epoch ,",
    "heat conduction is unimportant , since the interior is nearly isothermal .",
    "nevertheless two significant , though smaller , effects remain .",
    "the first effect is the reduction of the central density with respect to the static , non - rotating case , if one fixes the gravitational mass or the rest mass .",
    "since the neutrino emissivity depends sensitively on the density , especially in the vicinity of threshold densities for fast neutrino emission processes , the neutrino luminosity of the star is reduced as well .",
    "the second effect is the angular dependency of the surface temperature caused by the angular dependent surface gravity .",
    "the polar surface temperature is still by up to 31% higher than the equatorial temperature .",
    "both effects could also be studied with one dimensional codes or even within the isothermal core ansatz ( see @xcite ) . whereas miralles et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) assumed that the interior is still isothermal in the late photon cooling epoch , we find that the surface temperature distribution itself tends to an isothermal equilibrium , which implies that the temperature distribution in the outer crust becomes angular dependent .    the transition between the early and the intermediate epochs turns out to be delayed by rotation . because of the enlargement of the crust in the equatorial plane , the cooling wave formed in the inner region of the star needs several hundred years longer to reach the surface",
    "furthermore , the transition becomes smoother , since the radial diffusion time it not isotropic any more ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the surface temperature , especially in the intermediate epoch , is rather sensitive to micro physical parameters ( superfluid energy gap , neutrino emissivity , equation of state , etc . ;",
    "see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the comparison of the net effect with observation might therefore be difficult .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison of the observed soft x - ray spectra with the theoretical obtained spectra may reveal the angular dependency of the surface temperature due to rotational effects .",
    "the deduction of the spectrum from the surface temperature distribution is , unfortunately , not at all trivial in non - spherical geometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , only the thermal spectra of slowly rotating neutron stars ( @xmath53 for the vela pulsar 0833 - 45 ) are known .",
    "it may however be expected that the thermal spectra of a young , isolated millisecond pulsar can be detected in the near future .",
    "for example , the period @xmath54  ms of the fastest pulsar b1937 + 21 ( @xcite ) known today corresponds to a ratio @xmath55 , which lies between the respective ratios of our two rotating models .",
    "since we neglected some important effects , like differential rotation and the loss of angular momentum , our work can only be understood as a first step towards two dimensional simulation of cooling of rotating neutron stars .",
    "of course , the two dimensional code presented here may also serve to investigate other non - spherically symmetric effects , such as the effect of strong magnetic fields on heat conductivity and neutrino emissivity .",
    "the inclusion of differential rotation and strong magnetic fields , as well as the mentioned deduction of the photon spectra will be addressed to future work .",
