    "in a recent paper merloni , heinz , & di matteo ( 2003 ) have shown that disc and jet emission from active black holes of any mass , from galactic x - ray binary sources to the most powerful quasars , are physically and observationally correlated phenomena .",
    "their main result is the discovery of a `` fundamental plane '' of black hole activity ; that is , if we define the instantaneous state of activity of a black hole of mass @xmath3 ( in units of solar masses ) , by the radio and hard x - ray luminosity of its compact core , and represent such an object as a point in the three - dimensional space ( @xmath0 ) , all black holes ( either of stellar mass or supermassive ) will lie preferentially on a plane , described by the following equation : @xmath4    there are two main reasons why such a long sought - after correlation has been discovered just now .",
    "the first is the importance of having large numbers of accurately measured black hole masses , which only became available in the _ hst _ era thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution needed for this kind of dynamical studies ( see e.g. magorrian et al .",
    ". moreover , the tight empirical correlation between black hole masses and central velocity dispersion of the host s bulge now allows to infer bh masses from larger scale galactic properties , greatly increasing the number of reliable mass estimates available , at least in the local universe .",
    "the second crucial factor is the identification of the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) x - ray spectral range as the best suited to unveil accretion activity , because of the little importance of absorption in that band ( barred compton thick sources , of course ) .",
    "however , the search for hard x - ray emission in all but the brightest galactic nuclei had to wait until the launch of the _ chandra _ satellite before it could be carried on in a systematic fashion ( see e.g. ho et al 2001 ) .    although currently marred by a large intrinsic scatter ( see the discussion in merloni at al .",
    "2003 ) , the fundamental plane relationship opens the way to a number of potentially important applications in the study of large samples of black holes , not least because the physics behind it is reasonably well understood ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ; falcke & biermann 1995 ; merloni et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "i would like to point out a simple way of using the fundamental plane relation as a ( gross ) mass _ and accretion rate _ estimator .",
    "coupling the two well determined local radio and x - ray luminosity functions of agn through equation ( 1 ) , it is possible to infer the main properties ( mass and accretion rate ) of the entire population of supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in the local universe . within the conference perspective",
    ", the goal of such an exercise is to highlight the importance of a multiwavelength approach to smbh population studies .",
    "if large optical / uv surveys as sdss are still crucial for determining bh masses ( either directly or via the @xmath5 relation ) , x - rays and radio data provide important clues on bh activity and physical state .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be inverted to relate bh masses to observed nuclear radio and x - ray fluxes and the distance @xmath6 ( in mpc ) : @xmath7 this is an entirely empirical relation , and as such is model independent . on the other hand , it is also possible to relate the observed x - ray and radio luminosities to the second fundamental physical parameter that characterizes any active black hole : its accretion rate in units of eddington luminosity , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the radiative efficiency ) .",
    "such an inversion , however , is model dependent .",
    "the reader is referred to merloni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a thorough discussion on how to constrain disc - jet models on the basis of the observed correlation coefficients .",
    "there they showed that the fundamental plane is consistent with the most general theoretical relation between radio emission , mass and accretion rate expected from synchrotron emitting jets ( regardless of their detailed geometrical and kinematical properties ) , provided that the x - ray emitting flow is radiatively inefficient . in this case , @xmath10 , and the radio luminosity satisfies : @xmath11 i.e. , @xmath12 scales with the _ physical accretion rate _ only .    taken together ,",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can then be used to build a one to one map of the @xmath13 plane onto the @xmath14 one , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the black hole mass function could be easily recovered if we knew the _ conditional _",
    "radio / x - ray luminosity function @xmath15 , namely the number of sources per unit volume with a given x - ray and radio luminosity : @xmath16 where the double integral is performed over the range of radio and x - ray luminosities such that the logarithm of the mass derived from eq .",
    "( 2 ) lies between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "an analogous expression could be written down for the accretion rate function @xmath19 , in which equation ( 3 ) can be used to determine the area over which the integral must be performed .",
    "while the @xmath20 is not known , we do know the two separately determined x - ray and radio luminosity functions . here",
    "i adopt for the 2 - 10 kev one , @xmath21 , that of ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while for the 5 ghz one , @xmath22 , that determined at 1.4 ghz by sadler et al ( 2002 ) , assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath23 .",
    "then i assume that it is possible to factorize the unknown conditional luminosity function as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a `` matching '' function that counts the number of object with x - ray and radio luminosities given by @xmath26 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "in such a way our ignorance about the true conditional luminosity function is enclosed in the matching function @xmath25 . a straightforward way around this obstacle is to use the local black hole mass function as determined from the @xmath27 relationship ( see e.g. aller & richstone 2002 ) to invert eq .",
    "( 4 ) , find the matching function @xmath25 and use it to calculate the accretion rate function ( more details in merloni 2004 , in preparation ) . in figure 2 , i show the result of such a calculation in the form of accretion rate and mass functions of local smbh .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "2a , the population of local black holes is dominated by sources shining , in the x - ray band , below 10@xmath28 of the eddington luminosity ( assuming a 10% efficiency ) .",
    "this is in agreement what the average value found using the x - ray luminosity function of seyfert 1 galaxies alone ( page 2001 ) , or with theoretical estimates based on semianalitic press - schechter calculation of black hole growth in cdm universes ( haiman & menou 2000 ) ."
