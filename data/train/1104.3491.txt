    "<S> we try to answer how to classify strongly interacting field theories , considering the nature of the superconducting transition . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic superconductor model is our main ansatz as an effective low energy theory , expected to describe certain classes of strongly coupled conformal field theories . </S>",
    "<S> the effective interaction between vortices is our central object , allowing us to distinguish the type ii superconductor from type i , where the former will show the second order transition while the latter will display the first order . </S>",

    "<S> the effective interaction between vortices turns out to be a complicated function of both @xmath0 and @xmath99 , where the parameter @xmath0 is introduced to play basically the same role as the ginzburg - landau parameter . </S>",
