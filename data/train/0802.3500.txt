    "in 1966 , yoichiro nambu@xcite first proposed the su(3)@xmath0 gauge theory , i.e. , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as a candidate for the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , just after the introduction of the  new \" quantum number ,  color\".@xcite in 1973 , the asymptotic freedom of qcd was theoretically proven,@xcite and , through the applicability check of perturbative qcd to high - energy hadron reactions , qcd has been established as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction . however , in spite of its simple form , qcd creates thousands of hadrons and leads to various interesting nonperturbative phenomena such as color confinement@xcite and dynamical chiral - symmetry breaking.@xcite even at present , it is very difficult to deal with qcd analytically due to its strong - coupling nature in the infrared region . instead , lattice qcd has been applied as a direct numerical analysis for nonperturbative qcd .    in 1979 ,",
    "the first application of lattice qcd monte carlo simulations@xcite was done by m.  creutz for the inter - quark potential between a quark and an antiquark using the wilson loop . since then , the study of inter - quark forces has been one of the important issues in lattice qcd.@xcite actually , in hadron physics , the inter - quark force can be regarded as an elementary quantity to connect the  quark world \" to the  hadron world \" , and plays an important role to hadron properties .    in this paper , we perform the first detailed studies of the various inter - quark forces in the three - quark and the multi - quark systems with su(3)@xmath0 lattice qcd.@xcite",
    "in general , the three - body force is regarded as a residual interaction in most fields in physics . in qcd , however , the three - body force among three quarks is a  primary \" force reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "in fact , the three - quark ( 3q ) potential is directly responsible for the structure and properties of baryons , similar to the relevant role of the q@xmath4 potential for meson properties . furthermore , the 3q potential is the key quantity to clarify the quark confinement in baryons .",
    "however , in contrast to the q@xmath4 potential,@xcite there were almost no lattice qcd studies for the 3q potential before our study in 1999,@xcite in spite of its importance in hadron physics .",
    "as for the functional form of the inter - quark potential , we note two theoretical arguments in short and long distance limits",
    ".    at short distances , perturbative qcd is applicable , and the inter - quark potential is expressed as a sum of two - body one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) coulomb potentials .    at long distances ,",
    "the strong - coupling expansion of qcd is plausible , and it leads to the flux - tube picture .",
    "then , we theoretically conjecture the functional form of the inter - quark potential as the sum of oge coulomb potentials and the linear potential based on the flux - tube picture .",
    "of course , it is highly nontrivial that these simple arguments on uv and ir limits of qcd hold for the intermediate region .",
    "nevertheless , the q@xmath5 potential @xmath6 is well described with this form as@xcite @xmath7 for the 3q system , there appears a junction which connects the three flux - tubes from the three quarks , and y - type flux - tube formation is expected.@xcite then , the 3q potential is expected to be the coulomb plus y - type linear potential , i.e. , y - ansatz , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the minimal total length of the y - shaped flux - tube .      for more than 300 different patterns of spatially - fixed 3q systems ,",
    "we calculate the 3q potential @xmath1 from the 3q wilson loop @xmath10 using su(3 ) lattice qcd@xcite with the standard plaquette action at the quenched level on various lattices , i.e. , ( @xmath11=5.7 , @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath11=5.8 , @xmath13 ) , ( @xmath11=6.0 , @xmath13 ) and ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) . for the accurate measurement",
    ", we construct the ground - state - dominant 3q operator using the smearing method .",
    "note also that the lattice qcd calculation is completely independent of any ansatz for the potential form .    to conclude , we find that the static 3q potential @xmath1 is well described by the coulomb plus y - type linear potential ( y - ansatz ) within 1%-level deviation.@xcite we also find the universality of the string tension , @xmath16 , and the oge result , @xmath17 . as an example",
    ", we show in fig.1(a ) the 3q confinement potential @xmath18 , i.e. , the 3q potential subtracted by the coulomb part , plotted against the y - shaped flux - tube length @xmath9 . at each @xmath11",
    ", clear linear correspondence is found between @xmath18 and @xmath9 , which indicates y - ansatz for the 3q potential.@xcite    , i.e. , the 3q potential subtracted by the coulomb part , plotted against the total flux - tube length @xmath9 of y - ansatz in the lattice unit.@xmath19 ( b ) ( middle and right ) lattice results for y - type flux - tube formation in the spatially - fixed 3q system in ma projected qcd .",
    "the distance between the junction and each quark is about 0.5fm.@xmath20 , title=\"fig:\",height=151 ] , i.e. , the 3q potential subtracted by the coulomb part , plotted against the total flux - tube length @xmath9 of y - ansatz in the lattice unit.@xmath19 ( b ) ( middle and right ) lattice results for y - type flux - tube formation in the spatially - fixed 3q system in ma projected qcd .",
    "the distance between the junction and each quark is about 0.5fm.@xmath20 , title=\"fig:\",height=120 ]      as another clear evidence for y - ansatz , y - type flux - tube formation is actually observed in maximally - abelian ( ma ) projected lattice qcd from the measurement of the action density in the spatially - fixed 3q system,@xcite as shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "ma projected qcd includes electric and magnetic currents , which can be separated as the photon part and the monopole part with the hodge decomposition.@xcite we investigate these parts of the 3q potential in ma projected qcd in quenched su(3 ) lattice qcd with @xmath21 and @xmath11=6.0 , and find the following result .",
    "the monopole part @xmath22 of the 3q potential is almost single - valued function of @xmath9 , and is approximated as @xmath23 at long distances .",
    "the photon part @xmath24 of the 3q potential is almost single - valued function of @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the three sides of the 3q triangle .",
    "thus , whereas the electric current induces coulomb forces , the magnetic - monopole current induces the y - type linear confinement potential for quarks in baryons .    in this way ,",
    "together with recent several analytical studies@xcite and other recent lattice qcd studies , y - ansatz for the static 3q potential is almost settled .",
    "next , we perform the first study of the inter - quark interaction in multi - quark systems in su(3 ) lattice qcd.@xcite as for the potential at short distances , the perturbative oge potential would be appropriate , due to the asymptotic nature of qcd . for the long - range part , however , there appears the confinement potential as a typical nonperturbative property of qcd , and its form is highly nontrivial in the multi - quark system .",
    "in fact , to clarify the confinement force in multi - quark systems is one of the essential points for the construction of the qcd - based quark - model hamiltonian .",
    "then , we investigate the multi - quark potential in lattice qcd , with paying attention to the confinement force in multi - quark hadrons .      we first consider the theoretical form of the multi - quark potential , since we will have to analyze the lattice qcd data by comparing them with some theoretical ansatz . by generalizing the lattice qcd result of y - ansatz for the three - quark potential",
    ", we propose the oge coulomb plus multi - y ansatz,@xcite @xmath29 for the potential form of the multi - quark system . here , the confinement potential is proportional to the minimal total length @xmath9 of the color flux tube linking the quarks , which is multi - y shaped in most cases .    in the following , we study the inter - quark interaction in multi - quark systems in lattice qcd , and compare the lattice data with the theoretical ansatz ( [ vnq ] ) . note that the lattice qcd data themselves are meaningful as primary data on the multi - quark system directly based on qcd , and do not depend on any theoretical ansatz .",
    "we formulate the multi - quark wilson loop to obtain the multi - quark potential in lattice qcd.@xcite similar to the derivation of the q@xmath30 potential from the wilson loop , the static multi - quark potential can be derived from the corresponding multi - quark wilson loop .",
    "we construct the tetraquark wilson loop @xmath31 and the pentaquark wilson loop @xmath32 in a gauge invariant way as shown in fig.3 , and define them as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38=1,2 , @xmath39=1,2,3,4 ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given by @xmath42 the multi - quark wilson loop physically means that a gauge - invariant multi - quark state is generated at @xmath43 and annihilated at @xmath44 with quarks being spatially fixed in @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
