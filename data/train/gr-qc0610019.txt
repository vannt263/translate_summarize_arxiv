    "the characteristic , or null - cone , approach to numerical relativity is based on the bondi - sachs metric  @xcite , and has been successfully implemented in the pitt code  @xcite ( and also in other codes  @xcite ) .",
    "the pitt code has the important property that all tests have shown it to be long - term stable , for example in evolving a single black hole spacetime  @xcite .",
    "however , there are problems with the computation of gravitational radiation : it has been successfully computed in test cases  @xcite and also in scattering problems  @xcite , but it has not been possible to compute gravitational radiation emitted in astrophysically interesting scenarios , such as a star in close orbit around a black hole  @xcite .    this paper is a contribution towards the longer term goal of producing a characteristic code that can reliably compute gravitational radiation in situations of astrophysical interest , either within a stand - alone code  @xcite , or within the context of cauchy - characteristic extraction or cauchy - characteristic matching  @xcite . the first step in this process was to find a class of exact solutions to the linearized einstein equations  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are written in terms of the bondi - sachs metric and continuously emit gravitational radiation .",
    "thus they provide an appropriate testbed for validating further developments of the characteristic code .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a strategy for improving the code . in another context in numerical relativity  @xcite ,",
    "good results have been obtained by coordinatizing the sphere by means of six angular patches , rather than the two patch stereographic coordinates used in the pitt code .",
    "one advantage of the six patch system is that inter - patch interpolation is particularly simple because it is one - dimensional ( since ghost zone points lie on grid lines ) , leading to an expectation of reduced noise at the patch interfaces .",
    "further , this means that it is easy to go from second- to fourth - order accurate finite differencing of angular derivatives , since the interpolation order must also be increased and this is straightforward in the one - dimensional case . using the exact solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite as a testbed , we have computed and compared the errors obtained in ( a ) the stereographic code , ( b ) the second - order six patch code , and ( c ) the fourth - order six patch code . note that , in the fourth - order case , the radial and time derivatives are second - order accurate , so that overall the code is second - order  unfortunately , changing these derivatives to fourth - order would be a major undertaking , because they are not confined to a single subroutine .",
    "we found that , for equivalent resolutions , the errors of ( b ) are a little smaller than those of ( a ) , and that the errors of ( c ) are much smaller than those of ( a ) by a factor of nearly 50 .    as in the adm formalism , four of the ten characteristic einstein equations are not used in the evolution but constitute constraints .",
    "we have constructed and validated code that evaluates the constraints , and this can be used as a tool to monitor the reliability of a computational evolution .",
    "the numerical computations presented in this paper were all performed within the cactus computational toolkit  @xcite  ( http://www.cactuscode.org ) , using the carpet driver  @xcite  ( http://www.carpetcode.org ) to support the multiple - patch computations .",

    "the formalism for the numerical evolution of einstein s equations , in null cone coordinates , is well known  @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we give a summary of those aspects of the formalism that will be used here .",
    "we start with coordinates based upon a family of outgoing null hypersurfaces .",
    "we let @xmath0 label these hypersurfaces , @xmath1 @xmath2 , label the null rays and @xmath3 be a surface area coordinate . in the resulting @xmath4 coordinates , the metric takes the bondi - sachs form  @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a metric representing a unit 2-sphere embedded in flat euclidean 3-space ; @xmath9 is a normalised variable used in the code , related to the usual bondi - sachs variable @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "as discussed in more detail below , we represent @xmath8 by means of a complex dyad @xmath12 .",
    "then , for an arbitrary bondi - sachs metric , @xmath13 can then be represented by its dyad component @xmath14 with the spherically symmetric case characterized by @xmath15 .",
    "we also introduce the spin - weighted field @xmath16 as well as the ( complex differential ) eth operators @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "einstein s equations @xmath19 are classified as : hypersurface equations  @xmath20  forming a hierarchical set for @xmath21 and @xmath9 ; evolution equation @xmath22 for @xmath23 ; and constraints @xmath24 .",
    "an evolution problem is normally formulated in the region of spacetime between a timelike or null worldtube and future null infinity , with ( free ) initial data @xmath23 given on @xmath25 , and with boundary data for @xmath26 satisfying the constraints given on the inner worldtube .",
    "a complex dyad is written @xmath27 where @xmath28 are real quantities ( but in general they are not vectors ) .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath12 are unit vectors that are orthogonal to each other , and @xmath12 represents the metric .",
    "thus @xmath29 it is straightforward to substitute the a 2-metric into eq .",

    "thus @xmath12 is not unique , up to a unitary factor : if @xmath12 represents a given 2-metric , then so does @xmath32 .",
    "thus , considerations of simplicity are used in deciding the precise form of dyad to represent a particular 2-metric .",
    "for example , the dyads commonly used to represent some unit sphere metrics , namely spherical polars and stereographic , are @xmath33    having defined a dyad , we may construct complex quantities representing all manner of tensorial objects , for example @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",

    "we then introduce 6  coordinate patches covering neighborhoods of the @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 axes , with the angular coordinates @xmath92 in each patch defined as follows ( see note and @xmath93 in @xmath89 patches .",

    "the name `` inflated - cube '' comes from another way to visualize these patches and coordinates : imagine an @xmath99  cube with @xmath99  grid lines painted on its face .",
    "now imagine the cube to be flexible , and inflate it like a balloon , so it becomes spherical in shape .",
    "the resulting coordinate lines will closely resemble those for @xmath100 coordinates .",

    "we have therefore provided a numerical implementation of the new @xmath17-operators in the code .",
    "in addition , we have adapted the spin - transformation coefficients to the six patches . in order to test the six - patch code against the linearized solutions , the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath125 needed to be implemented for the six - patch coordinates and dyad .",

    "these coefficients are calculated and stored for repeated use in an initial routine .",
    "after each radial step during the integration of the characteristic equations , the ghost zones are synchronized by the multipatch infrastructure , and afterwards , the code multiplies the appropriate spin - transformation coefficients with the synchronized values of the ghost zones .",

    "we have implemented a version of the characteristic numerical relativity code that coordinatizes the sphere by means of six angular patches .",
    "further , the six - patch code has been implemented for both second - order and fourth - order accurate finite differencing of angular derivatives .",
    "we compared the errors in the second - order six - patch , fourth - order six - patch and stereographic versions of the code , using exact solutions of the linearized einstein equations as a testbed .",
    "this was done for a variety of cases and using several different indicators to measure the error .",
    "the convergence rate of the metric ( i.e. of @xmath23 ) was always approximately second - order , but in some cases we observed degradation of the order of convergence of other quantities , all of which contain second derivatives of the metric .",
    "this has shown up in previous performed runs of the code and might be related to high - frequency error modes coming from angular patch interfaces or corners .",
    "on average , the error norm of second order six - patch was smaller than that of stereographic by a factor of order two ( although there were cases in which the error was slightly larger ) .",
    "however , the fourth - order six - patch scheme exhibited a dramatic reduction in the error norm , by a factor of up to 47 compared to that of the stereographic case .",
    "thus , we expect the six - patch characteristic code , in particular the version that uses fourth - order accurate angular finite differencing , to give significantly better performance than the stereographic version .",
