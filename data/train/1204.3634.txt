    "mapping the links between progenitors and observed transients has become a key goal of supernova ( sn ) science , helping us to understand stellar evolution processes while also strengthening our confidence in the use of sne to understand the universe . in a number of cases the progenitor stars of core - collapse ( cc )",
    "sne have been directly identified on pre - explosion imaging ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smartt 2009 ) ) .",
    "this allows one to gain ` direct ' knowledge of progenitor masses when observed luminosities are compared to stellar models .",
    "however , the rarity of such detections limits the statistical results which can be gained .",
    "one can also relate overall host galaxy properties to the relative rates of sne to infer progenitor properties ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prieto , stanek &  beacom 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boissier &  prantzos 2009 ) ) .",
    "while this can attain significant statistics , the presence of multiple stellar populations within galaxies complicates the implications which can be drawn .",
    "our method is intermediate to these ; we investigate differences in cc sn progenitor characteristics using observations of the exact environments at the discovery positions of their explosions .",
    "other recent examples using similar techniques include : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leloudas et al . ( 2010 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modjaz et al . ( 2011 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kelly &  kirshner ( 2011 ) ) .",
    "we have obtained host galaxy h@xmath0  imaging for 260 cc sne . the sample can be separated into 58 sn type iip ( sniip ) , 13 iil , 12.5 iib , 19 iin , 12 ` impostors ' plus 48 snii ( no sub - type ) , and 40.5 snib , 52 snic plus 5 snib / c .",
    "to analyse the association of each sn with the sf of its host galaxy we use our ` ncr ' pixel statistic presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* james &  anderson ( 2006 ) ) . to produce an ncr value for each sn",
    "we proceed with the following steps .",
    "first the sky - subtracted h@xmath0  image pixels are ordered into a rank of increasing pixel count . alongside this",
    "we form the cumulative distribution of this ranked increasing pixel count .",
    "negative cumulative values are then set to zero and all other values are normalised to the total flux summed over all pixels .",
    "it follows that each pixel has a value between 0 and 1 , where values of 0 correspond to zero flux values while a value of 1 means the pixel has the highest count within the image .",
    "we measure an ncr value for each sn within our sample and proceed to build distributions for each cc sn type .",
    "the resulting cumulative distributions are displayed in figure 1 . in both of these figures (",
    "a and b ) , as a distribution moves closer to the black diagonal line from the top left hand side of the plots , it is showing a higher correlation with bright hii regions . in fig .",
    "1a ) we see a clear sequence of increasing association to sf going from the snia , through the snii , the snib and finally the snic .",
    "the most logical way to interpret differences in associations to sf is that more massive stars will be more highly correlated with bright hii regions .",
    "this is because these stars are a ) more likely to produce sufficient ionizing flux to produce bright hii regions , and b ) they will have shorter lifetimes and therefore have less time to move away from host hii regions .",
    "the implication is then that we observe a sequence of increasing progenitor mass .",
    "this starts with the snia arising from the lowest mass , followed by the snii , then the snib , and finally the snic arising from the most massive progenitors .",
    "these trends were first seen in a smaller sample published in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* anderson &  james ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "however , the current data set is the first to clearly separate the snib from the snic , with the latter now being seen to be significantly more associated with sf , and hence arising from higher mass progenitors ( these results , plus discussion will be presented in anderson et al . in preparation ) . on the sub - types plotted in fig .",
    "1b ) we find the interesting result that both the ` impostors ' and sniin show a lower degree of association with sf than the sniip .",
    "while there is likely to be a strong selection effect with respect to the ` impostors ' , for the sniin this implies that these events primarily arise from relatively low mass progenitors , contrary to general consensus .",
    "finally , we find some suggestive constraints that both the sniil and sniib arise from higher mass progenitors than siip .",
    "for 96 cc sne ( 58 snii and 38 snibc ) we have also obtained host hii region optical spectroscopy of their immediate environments which we use to determine region metallicities . to achieve this",
    "we use the diagnostics of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pettini &  pagel ( 2004 ) ) which give gas - phase oxygen metallicities from emission line ratios . in figure 2",
    "we show the resulting distributions of each cc sn sample .",
    "2a ) plots the absolute @xmath1-band magnitude of host galaxies against derived environment metallicities .",
    "while the mean metallicity of snibc is higher than that of the snii , this difference is not significant , and there is no clear offset between the distributions . in fig .",
    "2b ) we display the cumulative metallicity distributions of the snii , snib , snic and the combined snibc .",
    "while we see a metallicity trend going from the snii in the lowest , through the snib to the snic within the highest metallicity regions , the difference between these distributions is statistically insignificant .",
    "overall we see that snibc and snii arise from similar metallicity environments , implying similar progenitor metallicities . while this is the only study thus far to derive ` direct ' environment metallicities to probe differences between snii and snibc events ( a smaller sample was presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* anderson et al . 2010 ) ) , other recent results have been published on differences between snib , snic and lgrbs , finding different results ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leloudas et al . 2011 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modjaz et al . 2011 ) , and talks at this symposium by the same authors ) .",
    "through observations of the environments of cc sne we have presented progenitor constraints .",
    "we find that the main sn types can be ordered into a sequence of increasing progenitor mass : snia - snii - snib - snic .",
    "with respect to progenitor metallicity we find no significant difference between the snii and snibc populations .",
    "this argues that progenitor mass is the dominant ( over metallicity ) progenitor characteristic that influences resulting sn type . +",
