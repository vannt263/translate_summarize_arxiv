    "the limited resolution ability of optical imaging is an ancient and crucial problems in many aspects of science .",
    "nearly a century ago , the lowest central distance between two patterns that the light sources can just be resolved is known as the classical diffraction limit or the rayleigh criterion @xcite . one can not distinguish each pattern from the average image when two patterns are overlapped a lot .",
    "until now , new methods on beating the classical diffraction limit have attracted much attention in both theory @xcite and experiment @xcite . in these resolution problems ,",
    "a common light source is the fluorescence emitter , such as a biological cell @xcite , single molecule @xcite , or a nitrogen - vacancy center @xcite . because of the antibunching property of a single - photon emitter @xcite , in each emission only one photon is emitted .",
    "thus the interval of the emitted photons are much longer than the temporal width of a photon .",
    "the major advantage of single - photon emitter is that the photon number is determinant during each emission process .",
    "therefore when resolving n single - photon emitters , a common used strategy is detecting the high order correlation function of the emitted photons . because of the single - photon emitters , the n - th order correlation function contains the information up to n emitters .",
    "the image of each emitter can be achieved by combining several orders of correlation functions , on the resolved image the width of each emitter can be decreased to @xmath0 times @xcite .    although the resolution ability is not strictly defined , whether the emitters can be resolved or not is intuitional from the image .",
    "if the intention of resolution is recovering the diffraction pattern of each emitter , for single - photon emitters the image of each emitter can be reconstructed by combining several orders of correlation functions .",
    "this does not require any prior knowledge about the type of the pattern , and the variables describing the emitters are obtainable based on the super resolved image of each emitter @xcite .",
    "if the intention of resolution ability is obtaining the distance between the emitters , based on tsang the multi - photon absorption is not necessary . when the emitters can be controlled that there is at most one photon emitted , the estimation error of distance is constant by spatial - mode demultiplexing @xcite .",
    "in fact , the distance can be obtained via the already reconstructed pattern of each emitter . when resolving single - photon emitters , the total number of the emitters is obtainable by the maximal order of detectable correlation functions . with gaussian approximations",
    ", reconstructing the image of an emitter requires two variables : the width and the central position .",
    "the resolution ability is reflected by the relative size of distance and the width of a pattern : @xmath1 , therefore the image can be reconstructed with the knowledge of @xmath2 .",
    "above all , if the prior knowledge about the type of the pattern is known , image reconstruction and @xmath2-estimation are sufficient to each other .",
    "besides detecting photon coincide incidence on the same positions , the high order correlation function on different detector positions carries the information about the emitters too @xcite .",
    "hence the property of the emitter is achievable without reconstructing the image of each emitter .",
    "this can be used when resolving more than two single - photon emitters , since most of the emitted photons are not collected when detecting the correlation function on the same detector positions once a time .",
    "considering the high order correlation functions under all possible detector positions can be used for obtaining the information about the emitters below the classical diffraction limit .    inspired by these works , we propose a scheme to resolve the single - photon emitters with only the highest order correlation functions in this paper .",
    "we find that the distance between the emitters is obtainable from the correlation functions without image reconstruction .",
    "especially when there are more than two emitters , the spatial structure of the emitters is contained in the highest order correlation functions .",
    "therefore , we can resolve the emitters that have complex spatial structures only based on the knowledge of the highest order correlation functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : b ] we firstly investigate the resolution of two single - photon emitters with the help of second - order correlation detections using a two - dimensional detector array , we obtain the lowest bound which is approximately half of the classical diffraction limit . in  [ sec : c ] we investigate the resolution ability of three collinear single - photon emitters with third - order correlation detections only , we find that the distance between the emitters is the information that can be extracted from the third - order correlation functions under diverse detectors positions . in  [ sec : d ] we further consider the three single - photon emitters are on a two - dimensional plane .",
    "we find that by a proper strategy the variables which characterize the spatial structure of the emitters can be obtained by the third - order correlation functions . in  [ sec",
    ": e ] we summarize our work and draw our conclusions .",
    "when there are two single - photon emitters , named as a and b , suppose the emitters are too far away that the distance between them can not be directly measured .",
    "when the photons arrive at the position of the detectors , they are spreaded with the patterns named as point - spread - functions ( psf ) . assuming the psf of the photons from a and b are gaussian distributed , and the width of each psf is known as @xmath3 .",
    "this is practical , for example @xmath3 can be obtained by a nearby separated celestial body on the image . with gaussian assumption and @xmath3 is known , our purpose is to obtain the distance between the emitters , when the magnification ratio of the optical system is known , it is the estimation of the distance between the centrals of the psf .",
    "plane , the photons emitted from two single - photon emitters trigger two detectors once a time .",
    "the psf of the two emitters are overlapped and their image is obtainable by the average detection intensity formed by the detector array . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    our detection scheme is depicted in fig.([fig1 ] ) , the emitted photons are absorbed by a two - dimensional array of single - photon detectors .",
    "on the detectors array , the psf of each emitter is two - dimensional , while dimension of x and y can be written separately .",
    "therefore , in our investigations , dimension y has no effect on dimension x. suppose on the plane of the detector - array the psf from a and b is labeled as : @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 label the discrete positions of the detectors . using the gaussian assumptions , the psf of each emitter is written as : @xmath8$],@xmath9 $ ] . because of the single - photon emitters",
    ", the second - order autocorrelation is contributed by the emission of each emitter .",
    "considering the psf of each emitter , the second order autocorrelation at the detector position @xmath10is : @xmath11 where the total intensity @xmath12 .",
    "here we are interested in the numerator part of @xmath13 , which is the coincide rate on two detectors at @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "because the photons emitted from a and b are incoherent , in the limit of @xmath16 the coincide rate at particular two detector position @xmath6 and @xmath7 is : @xmath17 , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the detector s single - photon absorption efficiency , it is related to the wavelength of the photon and the type of the detector and it can be previously obtained . because the y dimensional of the psf is integrated to unity , only the x dimensional part of the psf is considered .",
    "when we have enough number of coincide events , we can divide these events into several parts based on the separation between the two positions that the coincide occurs . on the x - axis direction",
    ", we can label the left - sided coincide position as @xmath6 and the right - sided coincide position as @xmath7 . to obtain the coincide number under a certain separation @xmath19 , labeled as @xmath20 , the summation of @xmath21 under all the positions of @xmath6 which matches @xmath22",
    "is performed , where @xmath23 .",
    "the photons may arrive at the same detector , the detector should have the ability to resolve photon numbers @xcite .",
    "however our coincide event occurs in the period of @xmath24 , when the photons are separated on time scale ( such as the constant time difference between the emitters exitations ) , the absorbed photons can be resolve by the detector , thus the coincide event on the same detector can be observed . to reveal the relation between @xmath19 and the total distance @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath20 can be obtained by integrating @xmath6 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28e^\\frac{-(2\\delta+d_1-d_2)^2}{16\\sigma^2}. \\label{3}\\ ] ]    now we have a new distribution respect to detector separation : @xmath19 , since enough coincide events are collected by the detector array , the possibility of @xmath20 is relative to the summation of @xmath29 under all possible @xmath19 values , thus we have the normalized distribution of coincide rate under the separation : @xmath30    the maximal point of @xmath31 is obtainable by investigating the first derivative of @xmath20 , using eq.([3 ] ) we have the requirement of @xmath19 : @xmath32 . \\label{5}\\ ] ]     and @xmath33 .",
    "the middle figure reveals the distribution of coincide events @xmath34 based on eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "the lower figure reveals the left side and the right side of the equality in eq.([5 ] ) , the intersection is where the peak of @xmath31 occurs .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it can be further veryfied that when eq.([5 ] ) holds the corresponding value of @xmath35 is the peak value .",
    "therefore we have the relationship between separation @xmath19 and the distance between the emitters @xmath25 at the peak value of coincide rate distribution .",
    "the distance between the emitters can be obtained by finding the peak value of @xmath31 .",
    "usually @xmath36 is not our interested point , therefore whether the coincide event can be observed by one detector or not is not crucial in our strategy .",
    "it is revealed from eq.([5 ] ) the peak value of @xmath31 does not depend on the relative position of the reference point , it only depends on the total distance @xmath25 , therefore compared to first order detections , using second - order coincides can avoid the extra error introduced by mis - alignment .    to demonstrate the power of coincide detection , a comparison between direct image and coincide rate observations",
    "is depicted in fig.([fig2 ] ) , while the upper figure reveals the direct image and the middle figure reveals the function of @xmath34 . with @xmath3",
    "is known , in principle , the emitters distance is obtainable if there exists a peak in @xmath34 in the range of @xmath37 .",
    "as revealed by eq.([6 ] ) and the lower figure in fig.([fig2 ] ) , the left side and the right side of the equality are both monotonic function with respect to @xmath19 . to ensure the existence of peak value , at @xmath36",
    "the first derivative of the right side should be greater than the left side , thus we have the lowest bound that the distance can be obtained : @xmath38 this is obviously lower than rayleigh criterion . using the gaussian assumption",
    "the rayleigh criterion is approximately @xmath39 , the coincide detection can reduce the bound to approximately half of the rayleigh criterion .",
    "in this section we investigate the resolution ability of three collinear emitters using the triple - photon coincide rates detected by a two - dimensional detector array , our scheme is similar to that depicted in fig.([fig1 ] ) except there are three emitters on the axis of x. we label the emitters as a , b and c , and the distance between a and b : @xmath40 , b and c : @xmath41 .",
    "thus the psf of each emitter can be written as : @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is the alignment parameter .",
    "the third - order autocorrelation at the detectors position ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath46 ) is : @xmath47 where the total intensity at time @xmath24 is @xmath48 .",
    "we are interested in the numerator part of @xmath49 , which is the triple - photon coincide rates where the photons arrive at the detector array are : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath46 .",
    "because the y dimensional part of the psf is integrated to unity , our investigateion can be simplified on dimension x only .",
    "therefore in the limit of @xmath50 , at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath51 the triple - photon coincide rate can be written as : @xmath52+\\\\ & p_a(x_j)\\left[p_b(x_i)p_c(x_k)+p_b(x_k)p_c(x_i)\\right]+\\\\ & p_a(x_k)\\left[p_b(x_i)p_c(x_j)+p_b(x_j)p_c(x_i)\\right ] .",

    "in fact , the coincide rate obtained by eq.([9 ] ) and eq.([10 ] ) is only related to the relative separation : @xmath53 and @xmath54 , namely , if all the spatial position that has non - zero photon absorption are considered , changing the relative position between the psf and the reference point makes no difference to @xmath67 , therefore for simplicity we set @xmath64 .    here , we numerically investigate the resolution ability of emitter a , b and c based on @xmath65 and @xmath70 .",
    "firstly we investigate the distance between a and b. b and c is the same that @xmath33 . in row",
    "( a ) of fig.([fig3 ] ) , the spatial image of the psf is depicted by the left - sided figure , obviously it is difficult ( or not possible ) to distinguish the psf of each emitter by directly observing the image .",
    "the middle figure depicts the normalized coincide rate with variable of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , to determine the corresponding values of @xmath59 for the peak , the function of @xmath70 is numberically depicted in the right - sided figure . the investigation of @xmath70 is useful for error estimation , because the distance is obtainable from the distinct peak of coincide distribution .",
    "it is revealed by the right - sided figure that the maximum of @xmath73 occurs in a small range of @xmath59 where @xmath75 . at the central of the peak",
    "there is @xmath76 , which is very close to the distance : @xmath77 .    in the situation depicted in row ( a ) of fig.([3 ] ) , because the distance between a and b , b and c is the same , there is only one variable to be estimated : @xmath77 .",
    "when the emitters are not placed homogeneously , for example the distances between a and b , b and c are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we have @xmath78 .",
    "there are two variables to be estimated , as depicted in row ( b ) of fig.([fig3 ] ) we show that the information of @xmath40 and @xmath41 is contained in the distribution of @xmath65 , the values of @xmath79 can be obtained by investigating the peak of @xmath65 too .",
    "since the distance is obtained via the distribution of @xmath67 under enough detected samples , with the knowledge of the shape of @xmath67 and @xmath70 the distance can be obtained precisely via the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath59 .",
    "the estimation ability of distance is related to whether the peak of @xmath67 is distinct or not , if the emitters are too close that the peak of @xmath67 is implicit or the peak does not exist , the estimation ability is low or the distance is unobtainable .    as depicted by the numerical result in row ( b ) of fig.([3 ] ) , when @xmath71 and @xmath72 the psf of each emitter can hardly be resolved from the average image , as the revealed by left - sided figure .",
    "combining the middle and the right - sided figures , the corresponding values of @xmath59 to the peak of @xmath67 is @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these results reflect that the distance values can be estimated by the optimal @xmath53 and @xmath54 which corresponds to the peak position of the coincide distribution .",
    "although the estimation may be biased when @xmath79 is too small ( like the situation with two emitters ) , because the peak position is determined by the zero - point of @xmath70 and the relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath59 can be complicated , however it still gives approximated values of @xmath79 under @xmath82 , which is the capability that can not be provided by the average image alone .    . in both row ( a ) and rwo ( b ) , from left to right , the first figure is the image of three emitters .",
    "the second figure is the normalized distribution of @xmath83 as revealed by eq.([12 ] ) .",
    "the third figure is the distribution of coincide rate with respect to separations under the optimal values of angles .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in the previous section , we showed the enhanced resolution ability of three collinear emitters by third - order correlation detections .",
    "in reality the three emitters can be placed on a two - dimensional plane , the relative positions of the emitters is related to not only distances but also angles . therefore , to resolve the emitters on two - dimensional plane by third - order correlations , the distances between the triggered detectors",
    "are represented by two - dimensional vectors .",
    "here we still use the two - dimensional detector array depicted in fig.([fig1 ] ) to perform the third - order correlation detections , while the formation of @xmath49 is expressed by eq.([7 ] ) , with the separations between @xmath84 described by two - dimensional vectors , the triple - photon coincide rate is described by eq.([8 ] )    the total third - order coincide events is divided based on the relative positions between the triggered detectors . for example , when the triggered detectors are at positions @xmath85 , the distances between @xmath86 and @xmath87 can be expressed by two vector : @xmath88 and @xmath89 :    @xmath90    @xmath91    [ 11 ]    where @xmath92 and @xmath93 for covering all possible events under the integration on @xmath94 .    for the purpose of high measuring precision , the size of each detector in the detector array should not be too large .",
    "therefore @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath94 can be considered as continuous variables . as @xmath73 has four variables , finding the four optimal variables",
    "simultaneously is too computational costly .",
    "hence we firstly try to find out the optimal angles under all possible distance values , then continue to find out the optimal separations based on the knowledge of optimal angles .    in our numerical simulations",
    "we investigate two kinds of the emitters arrangements .",
    "the first kind is when the emitters are on the vertexes of an equilateral triangle , since the function of @xmath67 is obtained after integrating @xmath97 on all possible detector positions , we can write the psf of each emitter as : @xmath98 $ ] , @xmath99 $ ] , @xmath100 $ ] , where @xmath101 is the side length of the triangle , we assume @xmath102 and @xmath62 in our numerical investigations . in this case , after considering all the possible positions on the detector array and all the possible separation values of @xmath103 , we obtain a distribution with respect to only the angles @xmath104 , this process can be expressed as : @xmath105 with continuous variable assumptions the summations on @xmath103 can be replaced as integrations .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath83 is the possibility of finding the vectors with @xmath104 under all possible detector positions and all possible separations of @xmath103 , such distribution is achievable when enough samples of third - order correlations are collected .",
    "the normalized distribution of @xmath83 is depicted in the middle figure in row ( a ) of fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath104 is approximately @xmath106 , which is close to the real value that @xmath107 with @xmath108 estimation error . under the optimal angles ,",
    "the distribution with respect to @xmath103 under the integration on @xmath94 can be investigated , as the right - sided figure in row ( b ) of fig.([fig4 ] ) depicts . clearly , the distance between emitter a and c",
    ", c and b can be obtained by the optimal values of @xmath109 .",
    "compared to the average image depicted by the left - sided figure in row ( a ) of fig.([fig4 ] ) , the emitters are too close that only one light spot is observed .",
    "the second kind of the emitters arrangement is when one of the emitters is arranged further : @xmath110 $ ] , while the average image is depicted by the left - sided figure in row ( b ) of fig.([fig4 ] ) .",
    "as revealed by the middle and the right - sided figure , the optimal angle of @xmath111 becomes smaller and the optimal distance of @xmath112 becomes larger .",
    "the optimal values obtained from the peaks of the middle figure and the right - sided figure are : @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which is very close the real values based on the arrangement of the emitters .    in the above numerical investigations , we assume that the separation between the emitters are twice as the width of the approximated gaussian distribution : @xmath115 .",
    "the resolving capability of high order correlation detections require @xmath1 is not too small , for example with only two emitters @xmath2 should be greater than @xmath116 .",
    "when a third emitter is introduced , since the resolution capability depends on whether the optimal values exist , the critical distance is depend on how the emitters are arranged on the two - dimensional plane . from the numerical results depicted in fig.([fig4 ] ) , the variables that characterize the structure of the emitters can be achieved by only detecting the third - order correlation functions with @xmath117 .",
    "in this paper , we propose that the information of the emitters is obtained by the highest order of correlation functions , while the emitters can not be resolved from the image of the first - order correlation function .    in our investigations , the variables that characterize the emitters is not based on a direct measurement , they are based on the final distribution of high order correlations when enough samples of correlation functions are collected . thus the variables such as distance or angles of the emitters are indirectly obtained by the optimal values which characterize the distributions . unlike two emitters that the relationship revealed by eq.([5 ] ) is obtained analytically , for three emitters the relationship between the optimal values and the real values which describe the emitters is determined by the actual arrangement of the emitters , which is not the prior knowledge .",
    "therefore , the estimation error is the estimation bias based on the relationship between the distribution s peak and the variables that characterize the distribution .    compared to detect high order correlation functions on the same position , the correlation functions on various detector positions can be detected using a two - dimensional detector array . for precisely obtaining the high order distributions ,",
    "the number of the detectors is not limited .",
    "therefore enormous data samples should be collected , during the collecting process , a computer program should be used to classify each detection based on the relative positions of the triggered detectors , such classification criteria should cover all the possible measuring outcomes without duplications .",
    "the advantage of using detector array is that the high order correlations on different positions can be detected , which gives clues about the emitters without reconstructing the image of each emitter .",
    "this is useful especially when there are several single - photon emitters located in a small area , since reconstructing the image of each emitter is based on the correlation function on the same position , using a two - dimensional detector array is more efficient for photon collections .    in conclusion",
    ", we conclude that three single - photon emitters can be resolved by only detecting third - order correlation functions .",
    "the variables that characterize the emitters spatial distribution is obtainable by finding the optimal positions from the distributions of third - order correlation functions .",
    "the only reconstructed image is the distribution of third - order correlation function , and no post - processing of the collected data is performed .",

    "<S> rayleigh criterion has been continuously broken through with modern detecting instruments , many methods on resolving two emitters below the classical diffraction limit has been developed , one of these methods is detecting high order correlation functions of the emitters . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method to resolve the single - photon emitters with only detecting the highest order correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the variables that characterize the emitters are contained in the highest order correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> especially when there are more than two emitters , the spatial distribution of the emitters can be deduced only from the highest order correlation functions , which gives a new vision and a new method on beating classical diffraction limit using high order correlation functions . </S>"
