    "in the local universe early - type galaxies follow a tight scaling relation , known as the fundamental plane ( fp ) . the relation between effective radius , central velocity dispersion and surface brightness @xmath11 , which is a plane in @xmath12 space , was discovered by djorgovski & davis ( 1987 ) and dressler et al .",

    "the wavelength calibration was performed using the night sky emission lines .",
    "the typical rms scatter about the fitted dispersion solutions is about 1/15 of a pixel .",
    "since the dispersion is about @xmath37 for the data taken with the @xmath38 grating ( and @xmath39 for the @xmath40 data ) , the rms scatter is equivalent to velocity errors smaller than @xmath41 .",

    "such inaccuracies in de - fringing the data have no effect on the velocity dispersions because the spectra are effectively filtered on those scales ( and larger ) in the process of matching the continua of the template and galaxy spectra .",
    "the subtraction of the sky was performed using standard , published , and well - tested methods : for each galaxy the two - dimensional spectra were first rectified , and then 1st- or 2nd - order polynomials were fit to the pixels on both sides of the galaxy , typically excluding the few arcsec where the galaxy is bright .",
    "an iterative , clipping routine was used to reject any remaining bad pixels from the fit , similar to what iraf allows the user to do .",
    "these methods have been discussed elsewhere at great length and we choose not to bore the reader with very familiar territory . while more complicated and precise means of sky subtraction are now available ( see kelson 2003 ) , these data were analyzed before such methods became available , and the accuracy of the sky subtraction performed in the `` traditional '' way is satisfactory for our purposes .",

    "most importantly , pixels are no longer weighted uniformly in the computation of the fitting metric ( in this case @xmath46 ) . as in kelson",
    "2000b , we weight each pixel by the inverse of the expected noise ( photon and electronic read noise ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectra that exhibit strong balmer absorption had those features given zero weight in the fitting , in order to minimize the contribution of those features to template mismatch error , and also to ensure that our estimates of @xmath47 reflected the old , underlying stellar populations .",
    "we typically fit the spectra over a @xmath48 wavelength range ( in the restframe ) .",
    "we used a range of template stars , from g5 through k3 and adopted the template star that gave the lowest mean @xmath46 . in both clusters , hd102494 , a g9iv star , was the `` best '' template .    both observations and simulations by j@xmath16rgensen et al .",
    "( 1995b ) showed that , at low s / n , measured velocity dispersions were systematically too large .",
    "at the same s / n , this systematic effect was largest for the galaxies with velocity dispersions below @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we omit all galaxies with @xmath50 from our samples . furthermore , we limit our samples to sources with an error in @xmath47 smaller than 15% . errors in the dispersion and velocity are initially determined from the local topology of the @xmath51 surface .",
    "seven 053  galaxies with @xmath52 were observed both during the 1997 and 2001 observing run . a direct comparison between the derived velocity dispersions ( prior to the aperture correction ) is presented in fig .",

    "we note that the difference in @xmath69 between n = 3 and 4 is often too small to consider them as a seperate class of objects .",
    "we conclude that the visual and quantitative classifications divide the sample in roughly the same bulge and disk dominated classes .      in order to compare the fp of 053  and 054  with the fp of coma at @xmath83 we have to transform the effective radius to units of kpc .",

    "we derive a zeropoint shift with respect to coma of @xmath142 and a scatter of @xmath143 in @xmath6 . as expected , this is slightly different from the zeropoint shift of @xmath144 for the full early - type sample .",
    "the zeropoint offset is now in good agreement with k97 , but the scatter is still larger .    if we apply a mass cut for the 054  early - type galaxies of @xmath145 , we find a shift in zeropoint of @xmath146 compared to @xmath147 for the full early - type sample .",
    "the scatter of the high mass subsample ( @xmath148 in @xmath6 ) is similar to that of the full early - type sample ( @xmath119 in @xmath6 ) .",
    "we did not find evidence that fp residuals are related to environment .",
    "instead , stellar population effects are playing a role in shaping the fp and selection effects in our magnitude - limited samples need to be taken into account .",
    "first , early - type galaxies with stronger @xmath2 absorption also tend to have lower @xmath14 ratios than predicted by their @xmath57 and @xmath47 .",
    "this correlation supports the interpretation of fp scatter as a measure of age variation among early - type galaxies .",
    "the larger fp scatter in 053  therefore reflects a larger spread in relative ages than in the local universe .",
    "comparison of fp residuals with residuals from the cmr can not confirm or rule out the presence of such a stellar population effect .",
    "second , the fact that we do not see galaxies with low masses that lie on or above the fp , may be entirely explained by selection effects . only low mass galaxies that are brightened by some recent star formation",
    "enter the fp sample .",
    "their older counterparts are fainter than the magnitude limit for the dispersion measurements .",
    "correlations with residual from the @xmath7 relation show that differences in fp zeropoint can be explained by age differences of the stellar population . in this section",
    "we study the evolution of the @xmath14 ratio as a function of redshift and use this to estimate the mean formation redshift of cluster early - type galaxies . in fig.[mlevol.fig]a",
    "we show the evolution of the @xmath14 ratio with respect to coma .",
    "crosses refer to measured zeropoint shifts from the literature : coma at @xmath83 ( jfk96 ) , cl1358 + 62 at @xmath149 ( k2000 ) , cl0024 + 16 at @xmath150 ( van dokkum , & franx 1996 ) , 053  at @xmath0 ( k97 ) , 054  at @xmath1 ( vd98 ) and j0848 + 4453 at @xmath151 ( van dokkum , & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "the new results for 053  and 054 , based on our larger samples , are plotted with boxes .",
    "single burst evolutionary models for a formation redshift @xmath152 and @xmath153 are drawn with a solid and dotted curve respectively .",
    "they represent a galaxy that is fixed in mass and whose luminosity evolves as :    @xmath154    here @xmath155 represents the age of the universe at the moment the stars were formed .",
    "@xmath156 depends on the slope of the imf , passband and metallicity . for a salpeter ( 1955 )",
    "imf and @xmath157<0.5 $ ] models of bruzual & charlot ( 1998 ) , vazdekis et al .  ( 1996 ) and worthey ( 1998 ) give @xmath158 . using the new offsets for the two higher z clusters , the single burst model for a salpeter imf and solar metallicity favoured by the least square method has @xmath159 .",
    "the @xmath160 confidence level was derived from the difference in @xmath46 between the model and the overall minimum , @xmath161 , to which gaussian confidence levels were assigned ( e.g. press et al .",
    "1992 ) . as we showed in sect .",
    "[ mass.sec ] , the point of 053  deviates from the earlier result ( k97 ) since at low mass only galaxies with low m / l enter the magnitude - limited sample .    to avoid this bias",
    ", we apply a mass cut of @xmath141 to all clusters up to @xmath0 .",
    "a mass cut of @xmath162 was applied to 054  and j0848 + 4453 since at these higher redshifts the selection effect sets in at a higher galaxy mass . for j0848 + 4453",
    "two galaxies are left after omitting the one low mass outlier . as",
    "the biweight location estimator is robust against outliers , the zeropoint shift only changes slightly for this cluster .",
    "we obtain the evolution of the @xmath14 ratio as presented in fig .",
    "[ mlevol.fig]b .",
    "now the zeropoint of the 053  fp follows the trend seen for the other clusters in fig .",
    "[ mlevol.fig ] .",
    "if we constrain the analysis of the evolution in @xmath14 ratio to massive early - type galaxies , a simple linear fit gives @xmath163 , agreeing well with earlier determinations based on smaller samples or lower redshift ( see , e.g. vd98 ) .",
    "the formation redshift favoured by a least squares method is @xmath164 , slightly higher than the mean formation redshift for all early - type galaxies .",
    "a similar formation epoch for early - type galaxies in clusters was found by kelson et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on the evolution of balmer absorption - line strengths with redshift .",
    "it is remarkable how earlier studies of clusters based on smaller samples ( see , e.g. k97 ; vd98 ) gave similar results .",
    "we used visual and quantitative classifications to select bulge - dominated systems in our 053  and 054  samples .",
    "for 053we find a zeropoint offset with respect to coma of @xmath96 , larger than determined earlier on the basis of a smaller sample ( k97 ) .",
    "the scatter around the 053  fp is @xmath165 in @xmath6 , enhanced with respect to both k97 and the scatter in local clusters .",
    "the fp zeropoint of 054  ( @xmath104 ) agrees well with the earlier result of @xmath166 by vd98 .",
    "the scatter of @xmath167 in 054  is larger than reported by vd98 for a smaller sample of 054  early - type galaxies .",
    "however , taking into account measurement uncertainties , the scatter is consistent with that in local clusters ( jfk96 ) .",
    "late - type galaxies also follow the fp scaling relation and show a similar scatter around the fp as the early - type galaxies . adding the late - type galaxies to the early - type sample results in a scatter of @xmath168 for 053 and @xmath169 for 054 .",
    "the larger samples presented in this paper allow us to study correlations with other properties of the early - type galaxies .",
    "we do not find evidence that the formation history depends on environment in the cluster .",
    "no significant correlation of fp residuals with cmr residuals was found .",
    "the presence of a correlation between fp residuals and residuals from the @xmath170 relation indicates that stellar population effects are playing a role . assuming non - evolving slopes for all scaling relations",
    ", we find that galaxies with lower @xmath14 than the fp prediction tend to show stronger @xmath2 than predicted based on the @xmath170 relation .",
    "finally , we show that the lack of low mass galaxies on or above the fp may be entirely due to selection effects . to avoid a bias induced by the magnitude limit of our sample",
    ", we focus on the high mass end , where selection effects are less relevant . applying a mass cut at @xmath171 to all 4 considered clusters below @xmath172 and at @xmath162 to the 2 higher redshift clusters at @xmath1 and @xmath151 , increases the best fitting formation redshift from @xmath173 to @xmath174 .",
    "the mass cut at @xmath175 is well below the typical mass of early - type galaxies : galaxies with @xmath176 have dispersions of @xmath177 which is significantly lower than the @xmath178 dispersion of early - type galaxies which is @xmath179 ( kochanek 1994 ) .",
    "+ the implication of this work is that selection effects need to be taken into account , especially if the scatter is high .",
    "the scatter in 053  is slightly higher than at low redshift ; the scatter in the field at high redshift seems to be even higher ( e.g. gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ; van dokkum & ellis 2003 ) .",
    "hence those studies are likely to suffer from much more significant selection effects .",
