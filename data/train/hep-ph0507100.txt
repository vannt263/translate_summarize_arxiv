    "the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking in the mssm leads to a higgs sector with five physical states : two cp - even higgs bosons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one cp - odd one , @xmath4 , and two charged higgs bosons @xmath5 ( if cp is violated then the three neutral higgs bosons will not have definite cp - parity . ) .",
    "the discovery of the charged higgs bosons would be very important , as it would show directly that the higgs sector has more complicated structure than the one in the standard model , thus providing clear evidence for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the charged higgs boson couples strongly to the fermions of the third generation .",
    "if the charged higgs is heavy ( @xmath6 ) , it can easily be detected in decays to top and bottom quarks ( @xmath7 ) by examining the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum . in this case , @xmath9 may be measured to , at best , about @xmath10  gev at the lhc  @xcite , and about @xmath11  gev at an @xmath12 linear collider running at an energy of @xmath13  gev and collecting a luminosity of @xmath14  fb@xmath15  @xcite . in a number of other scenarios ,",
    "however , the charged higgs bosons will be rather light ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath17 in that range is a challenging task for any collider . in this case",
    "the charged higgs decays dominantly to a tau lepton and neutrino ( @xmath18 ) , and it is impossible to reconstruct directly the invariant mass of the di - tau final state .",
    "however , due to the polarization of the @xmath19 leptons , the energy of the @xmath19 decay products depends strongly on @xmath17 , a feature that can be exploited to extract @xmath17 indirectly .",
    "the main background to a @xmath5 signal in the @xmath19 decay mode comes from the @xmath1-boson decays @xmath20 .",
    "however , thanks to the different structure of the @xmath5 and @xmath21 electroweak interactions to @xmath19-leptons , the tau polarization is very different which will allow a separation of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on a statistical basis . more specifically , the @xmath19 decay products ( @xmath24 , or @xmath25 , etc . ) have strikingly different topologies according as to whether they originate from a parent @xmath21 or @xmath5 . the importance of tau polarization in searches for charged higgs bosons has already been stressed in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that @xmath26 leptons arising from @xmath27 decays are almost purely right - handed , in contrast to the left - handed @xmath26 leptons which arise from @xmath28 decays .",
    "this contrast follows from the helicity flip nature of the yukawa couplings of the higgs fields , and the helicity conserving nature of the gauge interactions .",
    "the most dramatic difference is seen in the energy distribution for the single pion channel ( @xmath29 ) in the rest frame of the parent boson ( @xmath21 or @xmath5 )  see fig .",

    ", it is nearly impossible to reconstruct the rest frame of the @xmath30 or @xmath31 bosons because the momentum of the neutrinos can not be measured .",
    "instead , one can use the top quark pair production channel with top quark decays ( @xmath32 ) and reconstruct the top quark rest frame .",
    "this is possible at a linear collider when the second produced top quark decays hadronicly , in which case one uses the recoil mass technique analogous to those in higgs boson studies  @xcite .",

    "this dependence allows one to extract @xmath17 from the shape of the spectrum .",
    "one can also take into account @xmath42 decay channel ( @xmath43 ) , which has twice the branching ratio as the pion channel .",

    "the width of the top quark decay to a charged higgs and b - quark takes the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 the @xmath51 correction proceeds from the one - loop vertex corrections , which modify the relation of the bottom yukawa coupling to the bottom quark mass .",

    "a brief description of our fitting procedure is given here .",
