    "the investigation on whether nature is supersymmetric is an important part of activities related to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . by and large , if supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , broken within the tev scale , has to offer a cold dark matter candidate , experiments at the lhc should see signals with large missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) , carried away by the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the lightest neutralino turns out to be the lsp  @xcite in most models .",
    "hard leptons and/or jets of various multiplicity constitute the accompanying ` visible ' signals when one has a neutralino lsp .",
    "it is from these , then , that one is left to guess the detailed character of the susy spectrum , and whether the low - energy spectrum is resulting from some organising principle at high scale@xcite .",
    "a scenario often suggested is that the first two families of squarks and sleptons are far too heavy ( @xmath2 5 - 10 tev or more ) to have any impact on tev - scale phenomenology , while the third family is within or around a tev in mass . while this still suffices in controlling the quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass , the troublesome issue of flavour - changing neutral currents @xcite is avoided through decoupling of the first two families  @xcite .",
    "this kind of a susy spectrum therefore deserves special attention in the context of the lhc .",
    "the present work suggests some improved criteria from which one not only obtains background - free signals of such a scenario , but also can distinguish it from one where all three families of sfermions are within the reach of the lhc .",
    "several theoretical schemes to achieve the suggested scenario have been proposed in the literature .",
    "it is possible , for example , to have a hidden sector of such composition that the third family couples to it differentially , leading to smaller soft susy breaking terms compared to those of the first two  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such possibilities can be envisioned in string - inspired models with flavour - dependent interactions with modular fields  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a horizontal symmetry , with the third , and first two families being respectively singlets and doublets under it , can also cause a mass splitting  @xcite . in so(10 )",
    "susy grand unified scenarios ( gut ) , too , suitable d - terms for the fields belonging to @xmath3 and @xmath4 of su(5 ) may lead to a mass hierarchy of the suggested type , with appropriate adjustment of parameters  @xcite . a similar mass separation can also arise out of the d - terms of some additional ( anomalous ) u(1 ) gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "finally , appropriate regions in the parameter space of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , with a universal scalar soft breaking mass term well above a tev , can lead to lower values of only the third family sfermions due to the role of yukawa couplings in the process of running down to the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "as we have already stated , our purpose is to take a close look at the _ lhc signals _ of a scenario where only the third family sfermions are within an accessible range . with this in view , we have chosen a few benchmark points in the parameter space , where masses of the first two families evolves down from a relatively high mass parameter at high scale .",
    "in contrast , masses for the third family and the two higgs doublets originate in a relatively lower high - scale parameter , thus creating a hierarchy of the type sought after .",
    "the absolute as well as relative values of the stop and sbottom masses are decided by other parameters of the theory including @xmath0 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the two higgs doublets , which is turn controls the mixing between the left - and right - chiral states .",
    "many useful studies on the collider phenomenology of similar scenarios have taken place earlier as well as in the very recent past .",
    "these include studies in both non - susy @xcite and susy scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , with the lhc within close range , many aspects of the detection of new signals are being realised with increasing degree of sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "the present study is aimed to supplement and extend the existing ones , keeping some such realisations in mind , and to demonstrate the viability of some additional final states and event selection criteria . to be specific , some aspects , on which we have improved on earlier works , are as follows :    * the signals suggested in earlier works often depend on the identification of multiple b s in the final state . when the mass range of accessible superparticles are about a tev or well above that , a large fraction of the b s arising from their cascades are quite energetic .",
    "the efficiency of b - tagging , on the other hand , is optimum for the transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) range of 50 - 100 gev@xcite .",
    "although the performance of b - detection devices have scope for improvement beyond this , we felt that it is profitable to _ suggest signals with only those b s whose @xmath5 lie in the optimal range_. * the signals often involve three or four top quarks in the final state . some of these tops can be considerably boosted .",
    "since very energetic jets acquire invariant masses amounting to 15 - 20% of their energy through spreading , it is not unlikely that these top quarks be faked by some energetic central jets in a machine like the lhc .",
    "besides , as has been pointed out in recent studies @xcite , top detection in this scenario has a rather low efficiency .",
    "therefore , we wish to suggest signals where the likely presence of several tops can be exploited , but the tops by themselves need not be identified . * with both of the above points in mind , we have suggested signatures of susy with mass spectra of the aforementioned type , by looking for various combinations of b s and leptons in the final state",
    ". specific event selection criteria , especially those pertaining to the leptons , have been proposed to eliminate backgrounds and enhance the discovery reach .",
    "we have also gone beyond earlier studies by suggesting that final states with the lightest neutral higgs , produced in association , can make the events stand out as a reflection of the nature of the neutralino spectrum . *",
    "it is also of interest to find out if the proposed signals enable one to distinguish a susy spectrum where only the third family is accessible , from one where first two are also within the production threshold .",
    "we suggest an effort in this direction by comparing the event rates in various signal channels and also looking at kinematic distributions such as the scalar sum of the @xmath5 s of all particles .    it may useful to specifically mention the points on which we have gone beyond the earlier works cited in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite for example , b - tagging has been highlighted as the main criterion ( with an emphasis on @xmath6 b - jets in @xcite ) .",
    "we have , on the other hand , taken the position that b s may not be efficiently tagged when they are very hard , and recommended that we depend on them only when their @xmath5 lies in the range @xmath7 .",
    "we suggest the use of leptons , with specific kinematic characteristics , to make good for ` lost ' b s .",
    "we have also underscored the reasons why tops , being often very energetic , be better not reconstructed .",
    "we outline our parameter choice for the benchmark points in section 2 , where the justification of our approach is also given by showing the kinematic properties of tops and b s corresponding to these points .",
    "studies on different signals as well as the strategies adopted for suppressing backgrounds are reported in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion on how one can hope to distinguish such a scenario from one where all sfermion families are produced at the lhc .",
    "we summarise our study and conclude in section 5 .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model has more than a hundred parameters .",
    "these parameters can be related by the supersymmetry breaking scheme .",
    "since our study is essentially phenomenological , we economise on the parameters by considering an msugra - like scheme , with the difference that high - scale squark and sfermion masses are not same for all generations .",
    "we take @xmath8 viz .",
    "scalar masses for the first two generations of sfermions , scalar mass for the third generation of sfermions , unified gaugino mass , sign of the higgsino parameter @xmath9 , the unified trilinear coupling for first two generations , the trilinear coupling for the third generation and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angle between the vevs of the two higgs doublets to be the free parameters .",
    "the first two families of squarks and sleptons are degenerate and have rather high masses @xmath12 whereas the third generation has masses in the range of @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "the first two generations of sfermions decouple and we have enhanced production of tops and bottoms in the final states .",
    "the benchmark points chosen by us in the above setting are based on the following considerations :    * being able to probe situations where the tops and bottoms coming out of susy cascades are energetic enough , so that their identification efficiency can be suspect . * the stops and sbottoms being within the reach of the lhc , going to values as high as possible , while there are appreciable numbers of events with an integrated luminosity of @xmath14 . * a scan over the gluino mass almost up to the search limit at the lhc , for medium as well as high values of the third family squark masses . * a fair sampling of values of @xmath15 , the chosen values being 5 , 10 and 40 .",
    ".chargino and neutralino masses in gev for all the benchmark points .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in r - parity conserving susy , only even number of superparticles can be produced .",
    "therefore , the peak of the @xmath16 distribution corresponds roughly to twice the mass of the lightest superparticle pair - produced through hard scattering .",
    "this gives us an indication of the mass scale of susy particles .",
    "it should be noted that , in msugra - based models , too , the third family sfermions are usually the lightest ( though the first two are not necessarily decoupled . ) thus the masses of the gluino and/or the third family squarks will be indicated by the peak of the @xmath16 distribution .",
    "the @xmath16 distributions for points 1c , s1 and s2 are shown in figure  8 .",
    "distributions for points 1c , s1 and s2.,width=264 ]    based on the information from the @xmath16 distribution and the event rates , we can draw the following inferences :    1 .   1 .",
    "the points 1c and s1 have a very similar spectrum for third generation squarks and gluino masses .",
    "they are not distinguishable by looking at the @xmath16 distribution alone .",
    "the cross section for squark and gluino production for s1 is very high since all the squarks are accessible .",
    "note , in particular , that the ratio @xmath17 is close to one whereas the ratio @xmath18 is much smaller . the @xmath19 final state which comes only from @xmath20 production shows comparable number of events due to similar gluino mass .",
    "the masses of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are smaller in s1 as compared to 1c .",
    "the b s in their cascades are therefore likely to have lower @xmath5 and therefore , their identification efficiency will be higher .",
    "rates for the channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 are highly enhanced for the points s1 . since @xmath26,(@xmath27 ) is allowed , their cascades into charginos yield larger number of dileptons .",
    "this also explains why on demanding one b - tag ( @xmath28 channel ) , the increase in the number of events is not so dramatic .",
    "2 .   1 .",
    "the @xmath16 distribution for the two points is very different and easily distinguishable .",
    "2 .   as intended , the number of events in the @xmath25 channel are nearly same @xmath29 for points 1c and s2 .",
    "the @xmath19 channel however , shows more events in the case of 1c ( @xmath30 . )",
    "this is to be expected since the mass of the gluino is higher for s2 and therefore , the cross section of @xmath20 is lower . also , the masses of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are higher resulting in higher @xmath5 of b s in the final state and hence lower identification efficiency .",
    "thus we find the the total cross sections for sparticle production are much lower for the case where only third family sfermions are accessible , making detection more challenging than the case where all three generations have masses @xmath33 .",
    "however , the points in parameter space of msugra which mimic the scenario are characterised either by a very different effective mass distribution or very different rates in the leptonic channels .",
    "we can conclude that this scenario can be distinguished from a universal scenario with all three generations are accessible .",
    "we have investigated the signals of susy at the lhc , when only the third squark family is kinematically accessible .",
    "we have emphasised the difficulties in identifying highly energetic tops and bottoms and suggested various combinations of b - and leptonic final states , including those with like - sign dileptons as viable alternatives to reconstruction of the top . only those b s",
    "whose @xmath5 lies in the range @xmath34  gev have been included so that the tagging efficiency is optimal .",
    "we have also used a large missing-@xmath35 cut of @xmath36 , and taken particular care in calculating the missing energy , including soft contributions to the visible energy .",
    "the above event selection criteria , together with the variable effective mass , become particularly useful is eliminating backgrounds .",
    "also , the fact that such scenarios have large production of the lightest neutral higgs on - shell ( in the decay @xmath37 ) when @xmath0 is low gives us an additional handle on identifying the order of @xmath0 .",
    "there are earlier studies in similar directions , to which we have already referred .",
    "in addition , while this paper was almost complete , we came to know about another work  @xcite where studies in similar lines have been carried out . while we agree with their main points , we have gone beyond the parameter region used by them ( with @xmath38 ) , and have explored the regions where gluinos are close to the lhc search limit , thus addressing relatively ` difficult ' regions in the parameter space where event rates are low .",
    "we end by re - iterating that the present work has improved upon each of the earlier ones in the following respects .",
    "( a ) the difficulties in identifying high - energy tops and bottoms have been explicitly addressed ( b ) the squark and gluino production cross section for such scenarios is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the universal case with all three families accessible . even with limited top and b - identification , our multichannel analysis ,",
    "_ strengthened by the use of leptons having specified kinematic properties in the final state _ , can take the discovery reach at the lhc for such scenarios to close to @xmath39 in the gluino mass , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath40 .",
    "( c ) the suggestion of using the associated higgs production is of added advantage , as it emphasises the nature of the spectrum through the viability of the decay @xmath41 depending on the value of @xmath42 .",
    "( d ) the prospect of _ distinguishing the scenario under investigation from one with all three sfermion families accessible is emphasised through a combination of kinematic studies and ratios of event rates in various channels_. thus it is hoped that not only can one discover a susy scenario where only the third family is accessible , but can also set the scenario apart from the ones with all scalar families accessible , when sufficient luminosity accumulates at the lhc .",
