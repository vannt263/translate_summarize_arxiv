    "deep photometric surveys with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) are revolutionizing our knowledge of the star forming galaxy population at the epoch of hydrogen re - ionization , only a few hundred million years after the big bang .",
    "hundreds of candidate @xmath9 galaxies have now been discovered using the lyman break galaxy ( lbg or dropout ) technique using newly available hst wide - field - camera-3-infrared ( wfc3-ir ) data @xcite . recently , this technique has been pushed to @xmath0 by using hundreds of hst orbits to probe to unprecedented depths in the hubble - ultra - deep - field 2012 ( hudf12 ) @xcite .",
    "the lbg or dropout technique relies on absorption by intervening neutral hydrogen below the lyman limit at 912  and ly@xmath10 at 1216  to create a strong spectral break that differentiates high and low redshift galaxies using only broad - band photometry .",
    "this technique was first introduced in the 1980 s and 1990 s @xcite and broadly adopted as the main technique for finding candidate distant sources once it was shown to be effective spectroscopically on large samples at @xmath11 @xcite and then deployed at ever higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "the current frontier is to use the near - infrared wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/ir ) hubble ultra deep field data for j and h -dropout galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 and has led to a handful of tentative detections , most noticeably the source udfj-39546284 , a candidate @xmath13 galaxy @xcite previously claimed to be at @xmath14 @xcite . if confirmed to be at such high redshifts , even this single galaxy would be of paramount importance to probe the physics of the earliest phases of galaxy formation , and to quantify how star forming galaxies contribute to the re - ionization of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , spectroscopic redshifts are fundamental to ascertain the true redshifts of candidate high-@xmath6 lbgs . at @xmath15 application of the dropout technique",
    "has lead to notably diverse results with only limited samples being spectroscopically confirmed @xcite , and the vast majority of spectroscopy failing to detect anything significant .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite , two of the largest spectroscopic samples at @xmath15 to date , confirm less than half of their targeted objects .",
    "this is particularly problematic at @xmath16 where exotic objects can contaminate the dropout selection @xcite .",
    "a growing body of evidence suggests extreme line emitters and unusual evolved galaxies at @xmath17 are a contaminant in @xmath18 lbg selections @xcite .",
    "in published spectroscopic studies of @xmath18 galaxies the vast majority of results are null , with a large fraction of detected objects placed at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the null results , combined with the type of contamination is worrying because it is from a poorly understood population of objects and so is difficult to include in the simulations required to quantify lbg selection criteria @xcite . in the near term",
    "this highlights the need for deep spectroscopic studies at @xmath20 where current spectrographs can hope to confirm existing high - z candidates and characterize contaminating populations . in the longer",
    "run the james web space telescope ( jwst ) and thirty - meter class ground based telescopes will be necessary to obtain the requisite spectroscopic samples at @xmath21 and faint fluxes needed to understand these populations .",
    "udfj-39546284 has been well studied by many authors and is only detected in the f160w h band filter with hst wfc3-ir , even though the deepest currently possible data exists at both bluer and redder wavelengths .",
    "it was first reported by @xcite who originally claimed it was at @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite recently improved the depth of the hudf f160w and the f105w images by 0.2 and 0.5 magnitudes respectively and added deep f140w imaging which overlaps the blue half of f160w .",
    "this new data ( hudf12 ) favors udfj-39546284 being at @xmath23 , but still allows the possibility it could be a strong line emitter at @xmath3 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite reported a @xmath24 line detection at @xmath25 with a flux of @xmath26@xmath2based on 40,500 seconds of hst wfc3-ir @xmath27 grism spectroscopy .",
    "however this detection required significant modeling of the data to remove overlapping spectra and background artifacts .",
    "subsequent re - analysis of the deeper imaging and spectroscopic data by @xcite now lead them to the conclusion that the galaxy is more likely at @xmath17 than @xmath28 based on the argument that the galaxy would be unusually luminous if actually at @xmath0 .",
    "if udfj-39546284 is at low redshift , the photometric constraints indicate it must be a young blue galaxy with strong line emission that has a line flux of @xmath29@xmath2for a typical dwarf galaxy velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the line reported by @xcite falls in a region largely free of sky lines and so can be confirmed by ground based spectroscopy which has significantly higher sensitivity and spectral resolution .    in this paper",
    "we present r@xmath30 @xmath31-band spectroscopy of udfj-39546284 with the mosfire multi - object infrared spectrograph @xcite on the keck - i telescope , reaching @xmath32 the sensitivity of the wfc3 grism spectroscopy between sky lines .",
    "this new instrument saw its first - light in april 2012 , and provides a substantial boost in sensitivity relative to previous facilities for studies of very faint distant galaxies .",
    "its high - multiplexing of up to 46 adjustable slitlets over a field of view of @xmath33 enables the simultaneous acquisition of scores of individual sources .",
    "in addition to udfj-39546284 we give a summary of the results from other objects on our slit mask in table [ t : results ] .",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and magnitudes in the ab system .",
    "data were collected on the nights of jan 15 & 16 , 2013 using the mosfire instrument on the keck - i telescope .",
    "conditions were photometric on both nights , with a median seeing of 1.2 .",
    "the instrument was configured with the h band grating , @xmath37 slit widths , 180s exposures , and 16 multiple correlated double samples ( mcds ) .",
    "the telescope was nodded by @xmath38 between observations with 44 exposures taken on jan 15 , and 48 on jan 16 , yielding a total exposure time of 4.6h on the mask .",
    "we used bright 2mass stars for alignment , but noted a significant @xmath39 offset between the 2mass and hudf12 astrometry which was corrected before generating the mask .",
    "we verified the alignment stars and galaxies in the hudf12 were on the same astrometric system by comparing the astrometry of the alignment stars and galaxies on the hudf12 images and the surrounding hst - acs images which covered a wider area .",
    "based on repeated alignment exposures taken every 1 - 2 hours during both nights the mask was aligned to better than 0.1@xmath40 during the observations . finally , to verify the mask",
    "was properly aligned , relatively bright objects were placed on slits around the mask and their flux checked against the expectations from photometry ( see figure [ align ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the mosfire python reduction package which subtracts nodded pairs of images , then shifts and co - adds the exposures using a sigma - clipped noise weighted mean .",
    "the argon and neon arc lamps along with sky lines were used for wavelength calibration .",
    "we generated a combined image of all 92 ( 4.6h ) exposures as well as combinations including only 3/4 of the data ( 3.45h ) to test the robustness of the reductions , noise estimates , and for temporal variations .",
    "flux calibration was accomplished by taking spectra of the white dwarf spectrophotometric standard star gd71 .",
    "the standard star was observed with a pair of exposures using identical setting to the science observations and reduced in the same way as the science data .",
    "the well detected spectra of the compact , 0.36 fwhm in the hst f160w images , @xmath41 galaxy cdfs21724 was used to verify our spectrophotometric calibration , slit loss , and noise estimates by comparing this spectra to the isaac h band flux from the musyc catalog @xcite , the goods - s early release science ( ers ) f160w flux , and the noise estimates from the mosfire exposure time calculator .",
    "based on the cdfs21724 spectra additional slit losses due to object extent and mask mis - alignment are estimated to be @xmath42 greater than estimated for the standard star .",
    "the noise measured in cdfs21724 between 15920 - 15950  is @xmath43@xmath2per 4.4  resolution element consistent with the estimate of @xmath44@xmath2from the exposure time calculator once the slit losses of @xmath45 due to poor seeing , and @xmath46 due to object extension and mask alignment are taken into account .",
    "two other bright objects cdfs21970 and cdfs23549 were also placed on the mask to verify the throughput and resulted in the expected signal - to - noise , but were not used for quantitative analysis because of a strong emission line ( cdfs21970 ) and complex morphology ( cdfs23549 ) which made a comparison to udfj-39546284 more difficult .",
    "the estimated sensitivity per resolution element is plotted in figure [ sens ] and results for the alignment galaxies and high - z spectra are given in table [ t : results ] .",
    "sensitivity per 4.4  resolution element at the position of udfj-39546284 is plotted .",
    "the measured sensitivity is consistent with that predicted by the instrument exposure time calculator .",
    "note that we should be able to detect a @xmath47@xmath2line implied by the photometry at several sigma between sky lines .",

    "we find no robust line detections , but do find a @xmath4 peak at @xmath89 with a flux of @xmath90@xmath2 in a 6-pixel diameter aperture ( figure [ det ] ) , consistent at the1.5@xmath91 level with the wavelength and flux reported in @xcite .",
    "we also measured the line flux using an optimal extraction assuming a 1.2 gaussian fwhm and found the same result .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath92 of the measured broad band flux , and would correspond to an observed frame equivalent width of @xmath93 .",
    "the peak is present in all of the reductions which include only 3/4 of the data ( at reduced significance , see figure [ jack ] ) and measurement of the flux at the positions of the expected negative images due to the dithering return a consistent negative flux , increasing the reliability of the detection .",
    "no known detector artifacts fall on this part of the detector , and no decaying latent images from alignment or previous observations are visible in the early frames of each observation or in the un - dithered stack of the data .",
    "a @xmath94 negative `` spot '' corresponding to a region of known bad pixels at one dither position is observed just below the line .",
    "the bad pixels have been masked , but as a result the data at this position only comes from one dither position .",
    "this negative spot is likely a sky - subtraction artifact due to a corresponding positive spot visible at the other dither position where the sky was determined .",
    "this is not an astrophysical object because the expected dual negative , single positive pattern is not observed .",
    "furthermore , this region varies in intensity in the 3/4 reductions , indicating it is either a noise fluctuation , or a transient effect in the detector .",
    "the region does not produce the adjacent positive detection observed for udfj-39546284 in other masks taken on the same nights .    despite the positive evidence",
    ", this detection should be considered tenuous because 291 other @xmath95 peaks are found between sky lines , 37 of which occur in the full stack and all four 3/4 time stacks , and 4 of which have two negative detections at the two expected dither positions .",
    "this places the probability of a chance co - incidence between a noise peak and the reported wfc3 grism observations at between @xmath96 and @xmath97 depending on wether we assume there are 4 or 291 @xmath95 peaks .",
    "in addition the peak is near a sky line increasing the chance of residuals .",
    "besides udfj-39546284 , we observed 4 j dropout , 3 y dropout , and 3 z dropout galaxies taken from @xcite and @xcite with details noted in table [ t : results ] .",
    "the goal of including these sources was to search for strong emission lines if the sources were actually at @xmath19 since all are expected to have ly-@xmath98 blue ward of our spectroscopic range .",
    "we find no lines at a sensitivity within 10% of that indicated in figure [ sens ] placing useful limits for future spectroscopic observations seeking ly-@xmath98 in the y and j bands .",
    "considering the possibility that udfj-39546284 is a @xmath99 galaxy , the hst observations imply a line flux of @xmath100@xmath2 . if we combine our 2.2@xmath91 flux measurement with the 2.7@xmath91 result of @xcite it results in a @xmath101 detection at @xmath89 with a flux of @xmath102@xmath2 , at the lower - end of what is required to explain the photometry .",
    "if we take this combined result at face value along with the photometric analysis of @xcite it indicates udfj-39546284 is likely at @xmath103 , and we are seeing the [ o ]  5007  line .",
    "but , at the low significance of our data and that of @xcite confirmation bias due to co - incident noise peaks is problematic and significant unknown systematic effects could be present in both reductions .",
    "furthermore , for typical [ o]/h@xmath104  line ratios of @xmath105 in strong line emitting galaxies @xcite one would expect a @xmath95 detection in f140w filter imaging if this source were at @xmath103 and this is not observed .",
    "in contrast to @xcite we find even the extreme object they find with a [ o]/h@xmath104  line ratio of @xmath106 should also result in a @xmath107 detection assuming the @xcite photometric limits .",
    "the discrepancy is due either to differences in the depths quoted between @xcite and @xcite which differ by @xmath108 magnitudes and/or to how the @xmath109 extreme object photometry and spectra were compared to the udfj-39546284 limits . in particular , we note the spectral energy distribution shown in @xcite is not directly comparable to the plotted udfj-39546284 limits because the filters in the two observations have significantly different bandwidths and the spectral energy distribution is dominated by lines which create significant non - linear flux changes as they redshift through the filter bandpasses .",
    "an alternative low redshift explanation is that we are detecting one of the [ o ]  3727  doublet lines at @xmath110 , however this is less likely since the [ o ]  line is typically significantly weaker than the [ o ]  5007  line .",
    "so more data are required before coming to any firm conclusions .",
    "we estimate @xmath111 of integration in good conditions with keck - i - mosfire or an equivalent instrument would confirm the tentative detection at 15985.5  at @xmath112 , but still be insufficient to detect other lines for typical [ o]/h@xmath104  line ratios in high - equivalent width line emitting galaxies @xcite",
    ". if the preliminary detection is the strong [ o ]  5006.8  line at @xmath113 the 4958.9  line would be behind a bright sky line and h@xmath104  would be too faint to detect .",
    "if instead we are seeing the less likely 3727  [ o ]  doublet at @xmath110 the second line of the doublet would be hidden behind the nearby sky line .",
    "one could also integrate for a similar amount of time in the @xmath114 band , and attempt to detect the h@xmath98  line if the source is at @xmath113 or both of the [ o ]  lines if the source is at @xmath110 .",
    "assuming our preliminary detection is real , all three of these lines fall between sky lines and should be detectable at @xmath112 for typical line ratios .",
    "this may be a more productive approach since it can differentiate between @xmath113 , 3.29 , and 12.14 .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation with alma would be expensive . assuming this source is at @xmath0 ,",
    "is un - obscured , and all of the continuum flux is due to star formation , the expected c  158@xmath115 m luminosity would be @xmath116jy assuming 1% of the bolometric luminosity is emerging in this line .",
    "with full alma this would require @xmath117 hours of integration in one receiver tuning to detect at @xmath118 .",
    "however , a non - detection would not confirm a low - redshift because of the intrinsic scatter in bolometric luminosity to c  line ratio .",
    "if udfj-39546284 is at high redshift we expect no detection in the longer spectra and it is unlikely that any conclusive spectra can be obtained with current instrumentation . the typical equivalent width of ly@xmath119 in @xmath120 galaxies is @xmath121 with a tail out to @xmath122 and is expected to decrease at @xmath123 due to the increasing opacity of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) @xcite . assuming udfj-39546284 is at @xmath0 , our flux limit would require a ly-@xmath98 equivalent width of @xmath124 to yield a @xmath4 detection . this large an equivalent width",
    "is occasionally observed in the @xmath125 universe , but less likely at @xmath0 where the inter - galactic medium is expected to be more absorptive . for a normal equivalent width of @xmath126 , @xmath127h of observation with keck - i - mosfire",
    "would be required to detect this galaxy , and even an adaptive optics assisted thirty - meter class telescope would require @xmath128h of integration .",
    "using the keck - i mosfire infrared spectrograph we recover the @xmath24 line detection reported in @xcite at the @xmath4 level . combining these results we find 3.5@xmath91 line a @xmath89 with an estimated flux of @xmath102@xmath2 , but the likelihood that this is a chance coincidence of noise peaks is non - negligible , so further observations are needed .",
    "if confirmed , the detection indicates udfj-39546284 is actually a low redshift line emitter at @xmath103 or 3.29 , so both @xmath31 and @xmath114 band spectra should be obtained to uniquely determine its redshift .",
    "if the source is at @xmath0 it is unlikely ground based 8 - 10 m telescopes or alma could confirm it and additional data will yield a non - detection .",
    "the difficulty in interpreting this source , and the high likelihood that it is actually at low - redshift highlights the need for spectroscopic studies at @xmath20 to understand possible sources of contamination at even higher redshifts .",
