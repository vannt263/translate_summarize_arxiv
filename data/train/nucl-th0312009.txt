    "production of the doubly strange baryon @xmath0 has been studied in heavy ion collisions at various energies . for ultrarelativistic energies at sps , the measured @xmath0 abundance",
    "is significantly enhanced compared to that expected from initial nucleon - nucleon collisions @xcite .",
    "explanations for this enhancement include exotic mechanisms due to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma , topological defects , and color ropes as well as more conventional processes of strangeness - exchange reactions such as @xmath9 and @xmath2 spal01 . in the latter case",
    ", the experimental data can , however , only be explained if a relatively high dense hadronic matter exists in these collisions .",
    "observations of @xmath0 production at lower energies at the ags , e.g. , au+au collisions at 6 agev @xcite , have also been reported recently , and the measured yield is comparable to the predictions from the transport model based on strangeness - exchange reactions @xcite .",
    "again , the hadronic density reached in these collisions is quite large with maximum density reaching 7 - 8 times normal nuclear matter density . in all these cases",
    ", the @xmath0 yield seems to be consistent with that given by the statistical model @xcite .",
    "although both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are infrequently produced in heavy ion collisions at lower gsi energies , i.e. , about 1 - 2 agev , which are below the threshold for producing these particles from nucleon - nucleon collisions in free space , studies of their production have provided valuable information about the nuclear equation of state at high densities as well as the in - medium properties of hadrons ko96,cassing99 . the latter is believed to be related to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in hot dense matter .    in the present study , @xmath12 production in heavy - ion collisions at energies , which are below the threshold of about @xmath13 for its production in nucleon - nucleon collisions in free space",
    "is studied in the framework of a relativistic transport model .",
    "we include @xmath0 production from the strangeness - exchange reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 with their cross sections taken from the predictions of a coupled - channel approach based on a flavor su(3)-invariant hadronic lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 yield from these collisions thus depends on the cross sections for these reactions as well as the abundance of @xmath10 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the collisions .",
    "medium effects due to modified kaon properties are also studied as it is known to affect the production of @xmath10 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 in dense matter @xcite .",
    "we find that the final @xmath12 yield is not much affected by the medium effects but is sensitive to the cross sections for the strangeness - exchange reactions , thus offering the possibility of testing the predicted cross sections from the hadronic model .",

    "besides undergoing elastic and inelastic two - body scatterings , these particles also propagate in mean - field potentials . for nucleons ,",
    "their potential is taken from the effective chiral lagrangian of ref.@xcite instead of the nonlinear walecka model used in ref.@xcite . as a result",

    ", we use the set that gives a nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath25 and a nucleon effective mass @xmath26 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath27 @xmath28 . the @xmath29 resonance is assumed to have the same mean - field potential as the nucleon , while the mean - field potential for the pion is neglected .",
    "kaons together with its partners ( hyperons or antikaons ) are produced in this model from pion - baryon and baryon - baryon reactions , i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in refs.@xcite , the cross section for the reaction @xmath32",
    "is taken from the resonance model of ref.@xcite . here",
    ", we use that from an improved resonance model @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath33 is , on the other hand , taken from the one - boson - exchange model of refs .",
    "antikaons in this model are produced not only from pion - baryon and baryon - baryon reactions , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , but also from the pion - hyperon reactions @xmath36 @xcite , where @xmath37 denotes either @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "their cross sections are taken either from predictions of the boson - exchange model or from the empirical values as in ref .",
    "annihilation of produced antikaons is included via the inverse reactions of pion - hyperon reactions , i.e. , @xmath40 , as other absorption reactions involve the rarely produced kaons and are thus unimportant .",
    "however , the annihilation of kaons is neglected as it has little effect on kaon production @xcite .",
    "because of the small production probabilities of kaons , hyperons , and antikaons in heavy - ion collisions at energies , the above discussed reactions are treated perturbatively . in this method , the dynamics of nucleons , @xmath29 resonances , and pions that produce these particles are not affected , and the produced particle is given a probability determined by the ratio of its production cross section to the total two - body scattering cross section .    after being produced , these rare particles also undergo elastic and inelastic scattering as well as propagate in mean - field potentials . for @xmath41 and @xmath39 ,",
    "their mean - field potentials are taken to be @xmath42 of the nucleon potential according to their light quark content .",

    "these reactions have , however , been studied in the coupled - channel approach based on a gauged flavor -invariant hadronic lagrangian @xcite .",
