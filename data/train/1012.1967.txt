    "the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics by de broglie and bohm provides the concept of trajectories for the dynamics of microscopic objects  @xcite .",
    "these trajectories , called bohmian trajectories or quantum trajectories , are navigated by the wavefunction .",
    "conversely , if we regard the probability density ( i.e. , the squared modulus of the wavefunction ) of the system as a fluid , the flow of this fluid can be elucidated by the quantum trajectories  @xcite .",
    "it is this characteristics of the bohmian trajectories that we want to utilize in this article to visualize and analyze a recently revealed counter - intuitive electronic motion in h@xmath0 molecular ion exposed to intense laser light on an attosecond time scale  @xcite .",
    "previously , we found in ab - initio numerical simulations that h@xmath0 at intermediate internuclear distances ( i.e. , between the equilibrium distance and the dissociation limit ) in an intense infrared laser pulse shows multiple bursts of ionization within a half - cycle of the laser field oscillation  @xcite .",
    "this ionization dynamics contradicts the widely accepted picture of strong - field ionization , namely that an electron leaves the atom or molecule with largest probability at the peaks of the oscillating electric field of the laser . for example , in the often used tunnel ionization picture the electron tunnels through the barrier created by the binding potential of the ionic core and the electric potential of the laser field .",
    "this tunnel barrier is , of course , thinnest when the electric field strength is strongest , which leads to the above mentioned expectation for the most likely time instant of the electron escape .",
    "we identified that the multiple ionization bursts are induced by a previously reported ultrafast transient localization of the electron density at one of the protons  @xcite .",
    "this attosecond dynamics can cause that the electron density near the tunnel barrier in the molecular ion is highest when the external field strength is below its peak strength .",
    "correspondingly , the electron does not tunnel most likely at the maxima of the field but at other time instants .",
    "we confirmed and extended earlier interpretations  @xcite that the internal dynamics of the electron is a result of a strong and exclusive trapping of the population within a pair of states of opposite parity , so - called charge resonant states  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the attosecond localization dynamics of the electron in the hydrogen molecular ion driven by the laser field can be successfully reproduced using a two - state model  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics can be also understood by the phase - space flow of the electron probability density regulated through so - called momentum gates which are shifted in time by the vector potential of the external laser field  @xcite .",
    "however , results of numerical simulations for the flow of the electron probability density often do not reveal many details and can not provide much further insights into the internal electron dynamics in the molecular ion .",
    "we therefore use the concept of bohmian trajectories to provide a complementary picture of the dynamics . by analyzing the motion of the trajectories",
    "we furthermore clarify that it is the phase difference of the wavefunction at the two protons that is the origin of the force which is sometimes driving the electron in the direction opposite to the strong electric field of the laser light .",

    ", we consider a simpler one - dimensional ( 1d ) model of h@xmath0 in which the positions of the protons are fixed in space .",
    "we have shown that the electron localization dynamics inside the molecular ion as well as the phenomenon of multiple ionization bursts does not change in higher dimensional models @xcite .",
    "in particular , we found that the nonadiabatic coupling between the electronic and nuclear motions is not essential for the internal electron dynamics .      in our 1d model of h@xmath0 with fixed positions of the protons ,",

    "the wavefunction value at every other step of its propagation was used to evaluate the velocities of the trajectories at the mid - point of one runge - kutta step to achieve the fourth order accuracy .",

    "<S> the results of the bohmian trajectory calculations do agree well with those of the ab - initio simulations and clearly visualize the electron transfer between the two protons in the field . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the bohmian trajectory calculations confirm the recently predicted attosecond transient localization of the electron at one of the protons and the related multiple bunches of the ionization current within a half cycle of the laser field . further analysis based on the quantum trajectories shows that the electron dynamics in the molecular ion can be understood via the phase difference accumulated between the coulomb wells at the two protons . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of the dynamics using a simple two - state system leads us to an explanation for the sometimes counter - intuitive dynamics of an electron opposing the classical force of the electric field on the electron . </S>"
