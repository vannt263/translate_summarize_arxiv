    "nowadays , everyone has an easy access to digital images via the internet and other means of communication . in addition ,",
    "powerful software and hardware tools are available to edit any kind of digital multimedia .",
    "so , digital images may become a problematic issue if it have significant authentications and information . to cope with this problem , _ digital image watermarking _",
    "can be employed .",
    "digital image watermarking is a procedure of embedding additional information called _ watermark _ into an image , called _ host image _ , which preserves the perceptual qualities of the original host image .",
    "when used normally , a watermark , carrying important information , is hidden and can be visible only by pursuing some particular processes",
    ". the watermark should be detectable or extractable from the host image by owner identification or integrity verification of the watermarked image @xcite .",
    "watermarking has a long list of applications in such areas as protecting copyright ownership of digital media , verifying the authenticity of a bill or the trademark of a paper manufacturer , making the information imperceptible , keeping the information secret , and so on .",
    "digital image watermarking has received a great deal of attention as much as to be practiced in many other important applications .",
    "references for theory and practice of this method are @xcite and @xcite , to name but a few .    for the subject to be fully grasped , presenting certain basic definitions seems necessary .",
    "a _ gray scale image _ can be demonstrated as a matrix the magnitude of each of whose components is called _ gray level _ or _",
    "intensity _ of the image at that point .",
    "a given image is called a digital image if all of its elements are finite and discrete quantities ; in this case , these elements are called _",
    "pixels_. _ digital image processing _",
    "( dip ) concerns using digital computers to preform processing on digital images .",
    "dip receives a digital image as an input , processes efficient algorithms on it by a computer and gives an image as an output .",
    "so , digital image watermarking can be construed as a dip .",
    "the theory of linear algebra provides helpful instruments for digital image watermarking as well as a variety of other fields of digital image processing .",
    "one of the most useful tools for digital image watermarking is employing singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 can be written in the form of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are unitary matrices , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes complex conjugate transpose .",
    "the matrix @xmath6 is an @xmath7 diagonal matrix such that its nonnegative entries are ordered in a non - increasing order ( see for example , theorem 7.3.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the influences and traits of singular values of @xmath8 in digital image watermarking , and regarding the point that the singular values of @xmath8 are the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 , this paper concerns itself with the eigenvalue of the normal matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 in order to obtain techniques for digital image watermarking which are more effective , yield better results and need fewer computations .    in the next section ,",
    "some definitions and concepts are briefly presented about normal matrices .",
    "section [ water ] consists of two subsections in which the proposed image watermarking methods are explained . in section",
    "[ exp ] , the validity rates of the presented watermarking schemes are investigated , and their efficiencies are compared by experimental results .",
    "in addition , the robustness of watermarking is evaluated against some common attacks and criticisms .",
    "in this section , definitions and some properties of normal matrices are reviewed .",
    "see @xcite and references therein as the suggested sources on a list of conditions on normal matrices .",
    "the proposed method based on these presented properties is explained in the next section .",
    "a matrix @xmath13 is called _ normal _ if @xmath14 .",
    "assume that @xmath15 is an @xmath16-square normal matrix , then there exists an orthonormal basis of @xmath17 consisting of eigenvectors of @xmath15 , and @xmath15 is unitarily diagonalizable .",
    "let the scalars @xmath18 , counted according to multiplicity , be eigenvalues of the normal matrix @xmath15 and let @xmath19 be its corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath15 can be factored as @xmath20,\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 . without loss of generality , assume that eigenvalues are ordered in a non - ascending order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "note that , if all the elements of the matrix @xmath15 are real , then @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the transpose of the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "a square matrix @xmath15 is called _ symmetric _ if @xmath26 and called _ skew - symmetric _ if @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to see that symmetric and skew - symmetric matrices are normal .",
    "also , all the eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix are real , and all the eigenvalues of a real skew - symmetric matrix are purely imaginary .",
    "a general square matrix @xmath15 satisfies @xmath28 , where the symmetric matrix @xmath29 is called _ symmetric part _ of @xmath15 and , analogously , the skew - symmetric matrix @xmath30 is called _ skew - symmetric _ part of @xmath15 . consequently , every square matrix can be written as the sum of two normal matrices : a symmetric matrix and a skew - symmetric one . this point is specially used in the proposed watermarking schemes .",
    "this section includes two subsections in which we present methods for digital image watermarking using normal matrices . to do this ,",
    "we transform both the matrix representing the host image and the one representing the watermark into the space of normal matrices .",
    "next , we benefit from the properties of its eigenvalue decompositions and embed the watermark into the host image . finally ,",
    "returning to our original space , we can construct the watermarked image .",
    "also , we may extract the watermark by following almost the same processes .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be two square matrices representing the host image and the watermark image respectively .",
    "two distinct methods are considered .",
    "first , we deal with the symmetric parts of @xmath31 and @xmath32 to obtain a digital image watermarking scheme .",
    "next , we explain another technique using both symmetric and skew - symmetric parts of the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 . it is noticeable that finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix needs less computation than finding its singular values and singular vectors",
    "furthermore , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a normal ( especially symmetric or skew - symmetric ) matrix can be calculated by explicit formulas and , therefore , may yet again require less computation @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe a digital image watermarking scheme based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric parts of the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this procedure can be carried out similarly for the case of the skew - symmetric parts of the two matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "notice that , for the same host image and watermark , results obtained by these two techniques ( using symmetric or skew - symmetric parts ) may be different .",
    "assume that @xmath31 is an @xmath33 matrix and @xmath32 is an @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 and @xmath36 be the symmetric parts of the two matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the normal matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be factored as follows @xmath37 @xmath38    let @xmath39 be a given scaling factor .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 regulates the strength of the embedding watermark into the host image .",
    "now , embed the symmetric part of the watermark into the symmetric part of the host image by modifying the eigenvalues of @xmath35 and then obtain the symmetric part of the watermarked image @xmath40 as detailed below : @xmath41    hereinafter , reconstruction of the watermarked image @xmath40 from its symmetric part is rendered . to do this , all the elements that are located above the main diagonal of the matrix @xmath31 are required .",
    "since @xmath40 can be construed as an acceptable approximation of @xmath31 , let us consider all the elements above of the main diagonal of @xmath40 as the elements of @xmath31 .",
    "obviously , the elements located below the main diagonal of the matrix @xmath42 are also determined .",
    "in addition , it is concluded from the fact @xmath43 that the elements which are stated below the main diagonal of @xmath40 can be obtained by subtracting the elements stated below the main diagonal of @xmath44 from the elements of @xmath42 . see the above equation where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the given and unknown entries , respectively .",
    "@xmath47}\\limits_y   + \\mathop { \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     \\times & { } & \\times   \\\\     { } &   \\ddots   & { }   \\\\",
    "\\checkmark & { } & \\times   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right]}\\limits_{y^t } .\\ ] ]    finally , it is clear that the elements on the main diagonal of @xmath40 are the main diagonal entries of @xmath48 .",
    "it should be noted that by this procedure , the watermark is embedded only into the elements that are placed below the main diagonal of @xmath31 , and its other elements are kept unchanged .",
    "furthermore , to reconstruct the watermarked image @xmath40 , we may reserve the elements located below the main diagonal of @xmath31 instead of the elements above the main diagonal and then follow a procedure similar to what is performed newly . indeed , we can partition @xmath31 into several segments and reserve it provided that @xmath40 can be reconstructed . this may be useful specially when unchanging some partitions of the host image is desirable during the digital image watermarking .",
    "now , as the next necessary step , we must be able to extract the watermark from the watermarked image .",
    "our scheme for watermark extraction implicates obtaining the symmetric matrix @xmath36 and then reconstructing the watermark image @xmath32 from it . in order to compute the matrix @xmath36 , the diagonal matrix @xmath49 and the unitary matrix @xmath50",
    "are required . keeping ( [ hatt ] ) in mind , the following relations describe our proposed extraction technique for finding @xmath36 @xmath51    anew , reconstructing the @xmath32 needs the elements which are stated above ( or below ) the main diagonal of @xmath32 and can be performed similar to what was mentioned in the case of reconstructing the watermarked image @xmath40 .",
    "let us once again remark that , if some segments of the watermark have more significance , then we can partition the watermark such that the important segments be preserved provided that reconstruction of the watermark is done .      in the previous subsection , a digital image watermarking scheme which embedded a watermark image into almost half of a host image",
    "was introduced .",
    "that technique kept more than half of the elements of the host image unchanged , which might lead to some usages and advantages and , in particular , was a suitable method for small enough values of the scaling factor @xmath39 . however , embedding all of the watermark into half of the original image may cause the watermarked image to lose its reliability as compared to some other watermarking schemes for large enough scaling factors . to cope with this defect",
    ", we introduce a new method concerning both symmetric and skew - symmetric parts of the watermark and the host image in order to embed the watermark in the host image completely .",
    "this new watermarking technique provides for a remarkably high reliability .    as already mentioned , every matrix is equal to the sum of its symmetric and skew - symmetric parts . in the proposed technique ,",
    "therefore , a given scaling factor is shared equally between the symmetric and skew - symmetric parts of the host image .",
    "keeping in mind the definitions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 may be employed to denote the skew - symmetric parts of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 may be written as follows : @xmath54 @xmath55    inspired by the method described in the previous subsection , for scaling factor @xmath39 , set @xmath56 therefore , the watermarked image @xmath57 will be @xmath58    henceforth , extracting the watermark @xmath32 will be considered to be from the watermarked image @xmath57 .",
    "the extraction process needs two diagonal matrices , i.e. , @xmath49 and @xmath59 , and two unitary matrices , i.e . ,",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath60 . in the presented watermark extraction scheme , at first , the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 are computed as the estimations of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "next , the extracted watermark @xmath65 will be obtained by approximating the two matrices @xmath36 and @xmath53 .",
    "assume now , @xmath57 is an acceptable approximation of the original image @xmath31 .",
    "form the symmetric and skew - symmetric parts of @xmath57 , namely @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in the order already mentioned , the eigenvalue decompositions can be computed as shown below : @xmath68    now , the diagonal matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 are obtained from the following relations : @xmath69 also if we consider @xmath70 and @xmath71 estimations of @xmath36 and @xmath53 , respectively , then @xmath72 finally , the extracted watermark @xmath65 will be @xmath73 .",
    "we should note that none of the four required matrices in the extraction process provides information about the host image and the watermark image .",
    "this point improves the safety of the presented watermarking method .",
    "in this section , the validity and the influence of the watermarking methods described in section [ water ] are examined by experiments .",
    "moreover , let us note that the ideas presented in this paper , can be used immediately to establish a block - based watermarking technique . a block - based watermarking scheme concerns dividing both the watermark and the host image into non - overlapping blocks and applying a watermarking method to each block .",
    "the block - based svd watermarking method is especially well known ( e.g. , see section 4 of @xcite ) .    in our experiments ,",
    "the watermarking method explained in subsection [ sb1 ] is considered for using either the symmetric or skew - symmetric parts of the host image and the watermark .",
    "also , the watermarking scheme demonstrated in subsection [ sb2 ] has been tested to prove its efficiency .    the peak signal to noise ratio ( psnr )",
    "is calculated to measure the quality of the watermarked image .",
    "psnr for gray scale images of size @xmath74 , whose pixels are represented with 8 bits , is computed by the following relations : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the elements of the original and the watermarked images , respectively . in the above relation , mse denotes the mean square error between the host image and the watermarked image pixels . in the performed experiments",
    ", we considered four host @xmath78 gray scale images ( a ) lena , ( b ) cameraman , ( c ) baboon and ( d ) peppers presented in fig [ fig : host_images ] .",
    "also , our watermark image was yazd university emblem of size @xmath79 , as displayed in fig [ fig : watermarks ] .",
    "the results are shown in tables [ table : lena ] , [ table : cameraman ] , [ table : baboon ] and [ table : peppers ] , for some values of the scaling factor @xmath39 , for the host images lena , cameraman , baboon and peppers and the watermark image yazd university emblem , respectively . in these tables ,",
    "method # 1 and method # 2 stand for using the symmetric and the skew - symmetric parts of the host and watermark images , in the image watermarking schemes , respectively .",
    "in addition , method # 3 denominates the watermarking technique described in subsection [ sb2 ] .",
    "the results obtained by these techniques are compared to the results achieved by the digital image watermarking method using svd which is denoted by method # 4 in our tables .",
    "furthermore , the robustness of our watermarking schemes was evaluated in the presence of different types of attacks .",
    "the bit error rate ( ber ) was used to measure the robustness between the original watermark and the extracted watermark .",
    "ber is the percentage of bits with errors divided by the total number of bits that have been processed .",
    "we should note that the proposed methods described in subsection [ sb1 ] are highly robust , and the ber results for those two methods almost zero under many types of attacks .",
    "hence , the results corresponding to the other watermarking method , which was denoted by method # 3 , are only presented and compared with results obtained by method # 4 to illustrate the robustness of our technique .",
    "the attacks used for examining the robustness of the method are median filtering , gaussian low pass filtering , averaging filter , wiener filtering , jpeg compression , additive gaussian white noise ( agwn ) , salt and pepper noise , resizing and adjust image intensity values .",
    "table [ table : bers ] shows the ber results for the host image lena and the watermark image yazd university emblem under various attacks , where the window size is @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , fig [ fig : attacked ] shows the extracted watermark without any attack as well as after applying some sample attacks .",

    "in this paper , the eigenvalue decomposition of symmetric and skew - symmetric matrices , as two important kinds of normal matrices , and their properties were used to obtain digital image watermarking schemes .",
