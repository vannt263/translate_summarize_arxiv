    "gravitational waves ( gw ) are ripples in space - time that travel at the speed of light , and whose emission by relativistic bodies represents a robust prediction of general relativity .",
    "the change in the orbital period of a binary pulsar known as psr 1913 + 16 was used by hulse and taylor  @xcite to obtain indirect evidence of their existence .",
    "although gravitational radiation has not been directly detected yet , it is expected that the present universe should be permeated by a diffuse background of gw of either an astrophysical or cosmological origin  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical sources , like the gravitational collapse of supernovae or the neutron star and black hole binaries coalescence , produce a stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) which can be understood as coming from unresolved point sources . on the other hand , among the backgrounds of cosmological origin , we find the approximately scale - invariant background produced during inflation  @xcite , or the gwb generated at hypothetical early universe thermal phase transitions , from relativistic motions of turbulent plasmas or from the decay of cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these backgrounds have very different spectral shapes and amplitudes that might , in the future , allow gravitational wave observatories like the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , the big bang observer ( bbo )  @xcite or the decihertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo )  @xcite , to disentangle their origin  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to the weakness of gravity , this task will be extremely difficult , requiring a very high accuracy in order to distinguish one background from another .",
    "it is thus important to characterize as many different sources of gw as possible .",
    "there are , indeed , a series of constraints on some of these backgrounds , the most stringent one coming from the large - scale polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , which may soon be measured by planck  @xcite , if the scale of inflation is sufficiently high .",
    "there are also constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite , since such a background would contribute as a relativistic species to the expansion of the universe and thus increase the light element abundance .",
    "there is also a constraint coming from millisecond pulsar timing  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been proposed a new constraint on a gwb coming from cmb anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "most of these constraints come at very low frequencies , typically from @xmath0 hz to @xmath1 hz , while present gw detectors work at frequencies of order 1 - 100 hz , and planned observatories will range from @xmath2 hz of lisa to @xmath3 hz of advanced - ligo  @xcite . if early universe phenomena like first order phase transitions  @xcite or cosmic turbulence  @xcite occurred around the electro - weak ( ew ) scale , there is a chance than the gw detectors will measure the corresponding associated backgrounds . however , if such early universe processes occurred at the gut scale , their corresponding backgrounds will go undetected by the actual detectors , since these can not reach the required sensitivity in the high frequency range of @xmath4 hz , corresponding to the size of the causal horizon at that time .",
    "there are however recent proposals to cover this range  @xcite , which may become competitive in the near future .",
    "moreover , present observations of the cmb anisotropies and the large scale structure ( lss ) distribution of matter seem to suggest that something like inflation must have occurred in the very early universe .",
    "we ignore what drove inflation and at what scale it took place .",
    "however , approximately scale - invariant density perturbations , sourced by quantum fluctuations during inflation , seem to be the most satisfying explanation for the cmb anisotropies .",
    "together with such scalar perturbations one also expects tensor perturbations ( gw ) to be produced , with an almost scale - free power spectra  @xcite .",
    "because of the weakness of gravity , this primordial inflationary gwb should decouple from the rest of matter as soon as it is produced , and move freely through the universe till today . at present , the biggest efforts employed in the search for these primordial gw come from the indirect effect that this background has on the b - mode polarization anisotropies of the cmb  @xcite , rather than via direct detection .",
    "the detection of such a background is crucial for early universe cosmology because it would help to determine the absolute energy scale of inflation , a quantity that for the moment is still uncertain , and would open the exploration of physics at very high energies .    in the early universe , after inflation , other backgrounds of gw could have been produced at shorter wavelengths , in a more classical manner , rather than sourced by quantum fluctuations . in particular , whenever there are large and fast moving inhomogeneities in the matter distribution , one expects the emission of gw .",
    "this is much like the situation in classical electrodynamics , but with some differences . at large distances from the source ,",
    "the amplitude of the electromagnetic field @xmath5 is expressed as the first derivative of the dipole moment @xmath6 of the charge distribution of the source , @xmath7 , while the amplitude of the gw is given by the second derivative of the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution , @xmath8 . in both cases , the larger the velocity of the matter / charge distribution , the larger the amplitude of the radiation produced . nevertheless , the main difference between the two cases is the weakness of the strength of gravity to that of electromagnetism .",
    "thus , in order to produce a significant amount of gravitational radiation , it is required that the motion of huge masses occurs at speeds close to that of light for the case of astrophysical sources , or a very fast motion and high density contrasts in the continuous matter distribution for the case of cosmological sources .",
    "in fact , this is believed to be the situation at the end of inflaton , during the conversion of the huge energy density driving inflation into radiation and matter at the so - called _ reheating _ of the universe  @xcite .",
    "such an event corresponds to the actual big bang of the standard cosmological model .",
    "note that any background of gw coming from the early universe , if generated below planck scale , immediately decoupled upon production , as can be easily understood by the following dimensional analysis argument .",
    "assuming that gravitons were in thermal equilibrium with the early universe plasma , at a temperature @xmath9 , the gravitons cross section should be of order @xmath10 .",
    "then , given the graviton number density @xmath11 and velocity @xmath12 , the gravitons interaction rate should be @xmath13 .",
    "since the hubble rate is @xmath14 , then @xmath15 , so gravitons could _ not _ be kept in equilibrium with the surrounding plasma for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , gw produced well after planck scale will always be decoupled from the plasma , and whatever their spectral signatures , they will retain their shape throughout the expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , the characteristic frequency and shape of the gwb generated at a given time should contain information about the very early state of the universe in which they were produced .",
    "actually , it is conceivable that , in the not so far future , the detection of these gw backgrounds could be the only way we may have to infer the physical conditions of the universe at such high energy scales , which certainly no particle collider will ever reach .",
    "however , the same reason that makes gw ideal probes of the early universe @xmath17 the weakness of gravity @xmath17 , is responsible for the extreme difficulties we have for their detection on earth . for",
    "an extensive discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we described the stochastic background predicted to arise from reheating after hybrid inflation . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the various processes involved in the production of such a background , whose detection could open a new window into the very early universe . in the future , this background could also serve as a new tool to discriminate among different inflationary models , as each of these would give rise to a different gwb with very characteristic spectral features .",
    "the first stage of the energy conversion at the end of inflation , preheating  @xcite , is known to be explosive and extremely violent , and quite often generates in less than a hubble time the huge entropy measured today .",
    "the details of the dynamics of preheating depend very much on the model and are often very complicated because of the non - linear , non - perturbative and out - of - equilibrium character of the process itself . however , all the cases have in common that only specific resonance bands of the fields suffer an exponential instability , which makes their occupation numbers grow by many orders of magnitude . the shape and size of the spectral bands",
    "depend very much on the inflationary model .",
    "if one translates this picture into position - space , the highly populated modes correspond to large time - dependent inhomogeneities in the matter distributions which acts , in fact , as the source of gw we are looking for .",
    "for example , in single field chaotic inflation models , the coherent oscillations of the inflaton during preheating generates , via parametric resonance , a population of highly occupied modes that behave like waves of matter .",
    "they collide among themselves and their scattering leads to homogenization and local thermal equilibrium .",
    "these collisions occur in a highly relativistic and very asymmetric way , being responsible for the generation of a stochastic gwb  @xcite with a typical frequency today of the order of @xmath18 hz , corresponding to the present size of the causal horizon at the end of high - scale inflation .",
    "there is at present a couple of experiments searching for such a background , see refs .",
    "@xcite , based of laser interferometry , as well as by resonant superconducting microwave cavities  @xcite .",
    "however , there are models like hybrid inflation in which the end of inflation is sudden  @xcite and the conversion into radiation occurs almost instantaneously . indeed , since the work of ref .",
    "@xcite we know that hybrid models preheat in an even more violent way than chaotic inflation models , via the spinodal instability of the symmetry breaking field that triggers the end of inflation , irrespective of the couplings that this field may have to the rest of matter .",
    "such a process is known as _",
    "tachyonic preheating _",
    "@xcite and could be responsible for copious production of dark matter particles  @xcite , lepto and baryogenesis  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , primordial magnetic fields  @xcite , etc .",
    "it was speculated in ref .",
    "@xcite that in ( low - scale ) models of hybrid inflation it might be possible to generate a stochastic gwb in the frequency range accessible to present detectors , if the scale of inflation was as low as @xmath19 tev . however , the amplitude was estimated using the parametric resonance formalism of chaotic preheating , which may not be applicable in this case . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( from now on referred to as paper i ) , it was shown that the process of symmetry breaking proceeds via the nucleation of dense bubble - like structures moving at the speed of light , which collide and break up into smaller structures ( see figs .  7 and  8 of paper i )",
    ". we conjectured at that time that such collisions would be a very strong source of gw , analogous to the gw production associated with strongly first order phase transitions  @xcite . as we will show in this paper ,",
    "this is indeed the case during the nucleation , collision and subsequent rescattering of the initial bubble - like structures produced after hybrid inflation . during the different stages of reheating in this model ,",
    "gravity waves are generated and amplified until the universe finally thermalizes and enters into the initial radiation era of the standard model of cosmology . from that moment until now , during the whole thermal history of the expansion of the universe , this cosmic gwb will be redshifted as a radiation - like fluid , totally decoupled from any other energy - matter content of the universe , such that today s ratio of energy stored in these gw to that in radiation , could range from @xmath20 , peacked around @xmath21  hz for the high - scale models , to @xmath22 , peacked around @xmath23 hz for the low - scale models .",
    "finally , let us mention that since the first paper by khlebnikov and tkachev  @xcite , studing the gwb produced at reheating after chaotic inflation , it seems appropriate to reanalyze this topic in a more detailed way .",
    "the idea was extended to hybrid inflation in  @xcite , but within the parametric resonance formalism .",
    "it was also revisited very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 chaotic scenarios , and reanalysed again for hybrid inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite , this time using the new formalism of tachyonic preheating  @xcite .",
    "because of the increase in computer power of the last few years , we are now able to perform precise simulations of the reheating process in a reasonable time scale . moreover , understanding of reheating has improved , while gravitational waves detectors are beginning to attain the aimed sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since these cosmic gwbs could serve as a deep probe into the very early universe , we should characterize in the most detailed way the information that we will be able to extract from them .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the hybrid model of inflation .",
    "section iii is dedicated to our approach for extracting the power spectrum of gw from reheating . in section iv , we give a detailed account of the lattice simulations performed with two codes : our own fortran parallelized computer code ( running in the marenostrum supercomputer  @xcite and in our uam - ift cluster  @xcite ) , as well as with a modified version of the publicly available c++ package latticeeasy @xcite .",
    "section v is dedicated to study the spatial distribution of the production of gravitational waves . in section",
    "vi , we reproduce as a crosscheck , some of the results of  @xcite concerning the gwb produced at reheating after chaotic inflation models . finally , in section vii , we give our conclusions and perspectives for the future .",
    "hybrid inflation models  @xcite arise in theories of particle physics with symmetry breaking fields ( higgses ) coupled to flat directions , and are present in many extensions of the standard model , both in string theory and in supersymmetric theories  @xcite .",
    "the potential in these models is given by @xmath26 where the contraction @xmath27 should be understood as the trace @xmath28 .",
    "inflation occurs along the lifted flat direction , satisfying the slow - roll conditions thanks to a large vacuum energy @xmath29 .",
    "inflation ends when the inflaton @xmath30 falls below a critical value and the symmetry breaking field @xmath31 acquires a negative mass squared , which triggers the breaking of the symmetry and ends in the true vacuum , @xmath32 , within a hubble time . these models do not require small couplings in order to generate the observed cmb anisotropies ; e.g. a working model with gut scale symmetry breaking , @xmath33 , with a higgs self - coupling @xmath34 and a higgs - inflaton coupling @xmath35 given by @xmath36 , satisfies all cmb constraints  @xcite , and predicts a tiny tensor contribution to the cmb polarization .",
    "the main advantage of hybrid models is that , while most chaotic inflation models can only occur at high scales , with planck scale values for the inflaton , and @xmath37 gev , one can choose the scale of inflation in hybrid models to range from gut scales all the way down to gev scales , while the higgs _ v.e.v .",
    "_ can range from planck scale , @xmath38 , to the electroweak scale , @xmath39 gev , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are a series of constraints that a hybrid inflation model should satisfy in order to be in agreement with observations .",
    "first of all , inflation should end in less than one e - fold , otherwise unacceptable black holes would form  @xcite . this can be written as the _ waterfall condition _",
    "@xcite , @xmath40 , which becomes @xmath41 then there is the condition , known as the cobe normalization , that the scalar amplitude should satisfy @xmath42 , which gets translated into @xmath43 as well as the spectral tilt , @xmath44 and finally the fact that we have not seen so far any tensor ( gravitational wave ) contribution in the cmb anisotropies , @xmath45 , imposes the constraint @xmath46    taking all these conditions together , we find that a model with @xmath47 is probably ruled out , while one with @xmath48 is perfectly consistent with all observations , and with reasonable values of the coupling constants , e.g. @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ". however , the lower is the scale of inflation , the more difficult it is to accommodate the amplitude of the cmb anisotropies with reasonable values of the parameters . for a scale of inflation as low as @xmath51 gev",
    ", one must significantly finetune the couplings , although there are low scale models based on supersymmetric extensions of the standard model which can provide a good match to observations  @xcite .    in the following sections we will show how efficient is the production of gw at reheating after hybrid inflation , using both analytical estimates and numerical simulations to derive the amplitude of the present day gwb . reheating in hybrid inflation  @xcite",
    "goes through four well defined regimes : first , the exponential growth of long wave modes of the higgs field via spinodal instability , which drives the explosive growth of all particles coupled to it , from scalars  @xcite to gauge fields  @xcite and fermions  @xcite ; second , the nucleation and collision of high density contrast and highly relativistic bubble - like structures associated with the peaks of a gaussian random field like the higgs , see paper i ; third , the turbulent regime that ensues after all these ` bubbles ' have collided and the energy density in all fields cascades towards high momentum modes ; finally , thermalization of all modes when local thermal and chemical equilibrium induces equipartition . the first three stages can be studied in detailed lattice simulations",
    "thanks to the semi - classical character of the process of preheating  @xcite , while the last stage is intrinsically quantum and has never been studied in the lattice .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to study the details of the stochastic gwb produced during the reheating of the universe after hybrid inflation ( sections iii , iv and v ) .",
    "however , we also study , albeit very briefly , the analogous background from reheating in some simple chaotic models ( section vi ) . thus , in this section we derive a general formalism for extracting the gw power spectrum in any scenario of reheating within the ( flat ) friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the formalism will be simplified when applied to scenarios in which we can neglect the expansion of the universe , like in the case of most hybrid models .    a theory with an inflaton scalar field @xmath30 interacting with other bose fields @xmath52 , can be described by @xmath53 with @xmath54 the ricci scalar . for hybrid models ,",
    "we consider a generic symmetry breaking ` higgs ' field with @xmath55 real components .",
    "thus , we can take @xmath56 for a real scalar higgs , @xmath57 for a complex scalar higgs or @xmath58 for a @xmath59 higgs , etc .",
    "the effective potential  ( [ higgspotential ] ) then becomes @xmath60 for chaotic scenarios , we consider a massless scalar field interacting with the inflaton via @xmath61 with @xmath62 the inflaton s potential .",
    "concerning the simulations we show in this paper , we concentrate in the @xmath58 case for the hybrid model and consider a potential @xmath63 for the chaotic scenario",
    ".    the classical equations of motion of the inflaton and the other bose fields are @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "gravitational waves are represented here by a transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge - invariant metric perturbation , @xmath66 , on top of the flat frw space @xmath67 with @xmath68 the scale factor and the tensor perturbations verifying @xmath69 . in the following",
    ", we will raise or low indices of the metric perturbations with the delta kronecker @xmath70 , so @xmath71 and so on .",

    "should be understood as spatially averaged .",
    "on the other hand , the perturbed einstein equations describe the evolution of the tensor perturbations  @xcite as @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",

    "thus , the effective source of the gw will be just given by the tt part of the gradient terms @xmath82 .",
    "in summary , eqs .",
    "( [ inflatoneq])-([scalareq ] ) , together with eqs .",

    "( [ gweq ] ) describe the production of gw in each of those scenarios . in this paper",
    "we use lattice simulations to study the generation of gw during reheating after inflation .",
    "specific details on this are given in section  iv , but let us just mention here that our approach is to solve the evolution of the gravitational waves simultaneously with the dynamics of the scalar fields , in a discretized lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we assume initial quantum fluctuations for all fields and only a zero mode for the inflaton .",
    "moreover , we also included the gw backreaction on the scalar fields evolution via the gradient terms , @xmath83 and confirmed that , for all practical purposes , these are negligible throughout gw production .",
    "a generic ( spatial - spatial ) metric perturbation @xmath84 has six independent degrees of freedom , whose contributions can be split into scalar , vector and tensor metric perturbations  @xcite @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath69 . by choosing a transverse - traceless stress - tensor source @xmath77 , we can eliminate all the degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) but the pure tt part , @xmath66 , which represent the only physical d.o.f which propagate and carry energy out of the source ( gw ) .",
    "if we had chosen only a traceless but non - transverse stress source , we could have eliminated the scalar d.o.f .",

    ". however , since the initial conditions are those of a scalar gaussian random field ( see section iv ) , even in that case of a non - transverse but traceless stress source , the mean vorticity of the subsequent matter distribution , averaged over a sufficiently large volume , should be zero ( although locally we do have vortices of the higgs field , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , since vortices with opposite chirality cancel eachother .",
    "this means that in such a case , although @xmath91 , and thus @xmath92 , we could still recover the tt component when averaging over the whole realization .    for practical purposes",
    ", we will consider from the beggining the tt part of the anisotropic stress - tensor , ensuring this way that we only source the physical d.o.f .",
    "that represent gw . the equations of motion of the tt metric perturbations are then given by eq .",
    "( [ gweq ] ) .",
    "note that for a non - transverse source the equations would have been much more complicated , so the advantage of using the tt part from the beginning is clear .",
    "the disadvantage arises because obtaining the tt part of a tensor in configuration space is very demanding in computational time .",
    "however , as we explain next , we will use a method by which we can circunvent this issue .",
    "let us switch to fourier space .",
    "using the convention @xmath93 the gw equations  ( [ gweq ] ) in fourier space read @xmath94 where @xmath95 . assuming no gw at the beginnig of reheating ( i.e. the end of inflation @xmath96 ) , the initial conditions are @xmath97 , so the solution to eq .",

    "however , @xmath118 is of the same order as the metric perturbation @xmath119 , so this extra term is second order in the gravitational coupling and it can be neglected in the gw eqs .",

    "this is a key point , since a relatively long period of turbulence will develop after preheating , which could change the amplitude of the gwb and shift the frequency at which the spectra peaks .",
    "so let us distinguish four characteristic times : the end of inflation , @xmath96 ; the time @xmath141 when gw production stops ; the time @xmath142 when the universe finally reheats and enters into the radiation era ; and today , @xmath143 .",

    "from now on , we will be concerned with hybrid inflation , leaving chaotic inflation for section vi . within the hybrid scenario , we will analyse the dependence of the shape and amplitude of the produced gwb on the scale of hybrid inflation , and more specifically on the _ v.e.v .",

    "indeed , all the initial vacuum energy @xmath166 gets typically converted into radiation in less than a hubble time , in just a few @xmath162 time steps .",
    "therefore , we should be able to ignore the dilution due to the expansion of the universe during the production of gw , at least during the first stages of reheating",

    "thus , we set the scale factor @xmath167 and the hubble rate @xmath168 and @xmath169 . as we will see later ,",
    "our approach of neglecting the expansion for the time of gw production , will be completely justified _ a  posteriori_.    the coupled evolution equations that we have to solve numerically in a lattice for the hybrid model are @xmath170 with t@xmath112 given by eq.([gwfakesource ] ) with the scale factor @xmath167 .",
    "we have explicitly checked in our computer simulations that the backreaction of the gravity waves into the dynamics of both the inflaton and the higgs fields is negligible and can be safely ignored .",

    "we have checked that the sum of the averaged gradient , kinetic and potential energies ( contributed by both the inflaton and the higgs ) , remains constant during reheating , as expected , since the expansion of the universe is irrelevant in this model .",

    "second , the higgs field oscillates around the true vacuum , as the higgs bubbles collide and scatter off eachother .",
    "third , a period of turbulence is reached , during which the inflaton oscillates around its minimum and the higgs sits in the true vacuum . for a detailed description of the dynamics of these fields",

    "we will be only concerned with the details of the gravitational wave production .",
    "the initial energy density at the end of hybrid inflation is given by @xmath176 , with @xmath177 , so the fractional energy density in gravitational waves is @xmath178 where @xmath179 , defined as a volume average like @xmath180 , is extracted from the simulations as @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the fourier transform of the solution of eq .",

    "note that in the case that @xmath187 , the maximal production of gw occurs in less than a hubble time , soon after symmetry breaking , while turbulence lasts several decades in time units of @xmath162 .",

    "moreover , since gravitational waves below planck scale remain decoupled from the plasma immediately after production , we can evaluate the power spectrum today from that obtained at reheating by converting the wavenumber @xmath138 into frequency @xmath189 . simply using eq .",

    "note , however , that the lower bumps are lattice artifacts , due to the physical cutoff imposed at the initial condition , that rapidly disappear with time .",
    "we have also checked that the power spectrum of the scalar fields follows turbulent scaling after @xmath197 , and we can thus estimate the subsequent evolution of the energy density distributions beyond our simulations .",
    "the problem of determining the time evolution of a quantum field theory is an outstandingly difficult problem . in some cases",

    "numerical methods rest on the path integral formulation in euclidean space and the existence of a probability measure in field space  @xcite . however , the problem we are interested in is a dynamical process far from equilibium , and the corresponding minkowski path integral formulation is neither mathematically well founded nor appropriate for numerical studies .",
    "there are a series of alternative non - perturbative methods which different research groups have used to obtain physical results in situations similar to ours .",
    "these include hartree s approximations  @xcite to go beyond perturbation theory or large n techniques  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that it is desirable to look at this and similar problems with all available tools . in the present paper",
    "we will use an alternative approximation to deal with the problem : the classical approximation .",
    "it consists of replacing the quantum evolution of the system by its classical evolution , for which there are feasible numerical methods available .",
    "the quantum nature of the problem remains in the stochastic character of the initial conditions .",
    "this approximation has been used with great success by several groups in the past  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the method is that it is fully non - linear and non - perturbative , allows the use of gauge fields  @xcite and gives access to the quantities we are interested in .",
    "the validity of the approximation depends on the loss of quantum coherence in the evolution of the system . in previous papers we studied this problem both in the absence of and with gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "we started the evolution of the system at the critical time @xmath198 , corresponding to the end of inflation @xmath96 , at which the effective mass of the higgs vanishes , putting all the modes in its ( free field ) ground states .",
    "if the couplings are small , since the quantum fluctuations of the value of the fields are not too large , the non - linear terms in the hamiltonian of the system can be neglected . then the quantum evolution is gaussian and can be studied exactly .",
    "the hamiltonian has nonetheless a time - dependence coming through the time - dependence of the inflaton homogeneous mode .",
    "this time dependence can always be taken to be linear for a sufficiently short time interval after the critical time . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamics of the eigenmodes during this initial phase differs significantly from mode to mode .",
    "most of them have a characteristic harmonic oscillator behaviour with a frequency depending on the mode in question . in the case of the higgs field ,",
    "the long - wave modes become tachyonic . by looking at expectation values of products of these fields at different times ,",
    "one realises that after a while these modes behave and evolve like classical modes of an exponentially growing size .",
    "the process is very fast and therefore the remaining harmonic modes can be considered to have remained in their initial ground state .",
    "the fast growth in size of the higgs field expectation value boosts the importance of non - linear terms and eventually drives the system into a state where the non - linear dynamics , including the back - reaction to the inflaton field , are crucial . for",
    "the whole approximation to be useful this must happen at a later time than the one in which the low - frequency higgs modes begin evolving as classical fields . in paper i we showed this to be the case .",
    "actually , there is a time interval in which classical behaviour is already dominant while non - linearities are still small .",
    "we tested that our results , in the absence of gauge fields , were insensitive to the matching time , provided it lies within this window .",
    "the whole idea can then be summarised as follows : the tachyonic quantum dynamics of the low momentum higgs modes drive them into classical field behaviour and large occupation numbers before the non - linearities and back - reaction begin to play a role .",
    "it is the subsequent non - linear classical behaviour of the field that induces the growth of classical inflaton and gravitational field components also at low frequencies .",
    "it is obvious that the quantum nature of the problem is still crucial if one studies the behaviour of high momentum modes which have low occupation numbers .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the same idea in the presence of ( gravitational wave ) tensor fields .",
    "the initial quantum evolution of tensor fields is also relatively slow , since there are no tachyonic modes .",
    "therefore , it is assumed not to affect substantially the initial conditions of the classical system .",
    "our approach to the dynamics of the system is to assume that the leading effects under study can be well - described by the classical evolution of the system .",
    "the justification of this point , as explained in the previous section , rests upon the fast quantum evolution of the long wavelength components of the higgs field during the initial stages after the critical point .",
    "all the other degrees of freedom will evolve slowly from their initial quantum vacuum state .",
    "for the higgs field , the leading behaviour is the exponential growth of those modes having negative effective mass - squared .",
    "the quantum evolution of such modes drives the system into a quasi - classical regime .",
    "it is essential that this regime is reached before the non - linearities couple all degrees of freedom to each other and questions like back - reaction start to affect the results .",
    "it is then assumed that it is the essentially classical dynamics of that field what matters , and that all the long - wavelength components of the inflaton and the gauge fields produced by the interaction with the higgs field behave also as classical fields .",
    "of course , this can hardly be the case for shorter wavelengths which stay in a quantum state with low occupation numbers .",
    "however , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for the range of times studied in this paper , the effect of shorter wavelengths is relatively small , and the spectrum of modes remains always dominated by long - wavelengths .    the full non - linear evolution of the system can then be studied using lattice techniques .",
    "our approach is to discretize the classical equations of motion of all fields in both space and time .",
    "the time - like lattice spacing @xmath148 must be smaller than the spatial one @xmath199 for the stability of the discretized equations .",
    "in addition to the ultraviolet cut - off one must introduce an infrared cut - off by putting the system in a box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 lattices .",
    "computer memory and cpu resources limit us from reaching much bigger lattices .",
    "nonetheless , in the spirit of paper i , there are a number of checks one can perform to ensure that our results are physical and are not biased , within errors , by the approximations introduced , see fig .",
    "our problem has several physical scales which control different time - regimes and observables .",
    "thus , it is not always an easy matter to place these scales in the window defined by our ultraviolet and infrared cut - offs .",
    "for example , in addition to the higgs and inflaton mass there is a scale @xmath203 associated to the inflaton velocity which is particularly relevant in determining the bubble sizes and collisions .",
    "then , when we want to study a stage of the evolution in particular , we make the selection of the volume and cutoff most suitable .",
    "since in this paper we are more interested in understanding the phenomenon of gw production , rather than concentrating in a particular model , our attitude has been to modify the parameters of the model in order to sit in a region where our results are insensitive to the cut - offs .",
    "this is no doubt a necessary first step to determine the requirements and viability of the study of any particular model .",
    "in particular , we have thouroughly studied a model with @xmath204 , but we have checked that other values of the parameters do not change our results significantly .",
    "the initial conditions of the fields follow the prescription from paper i. the higgs modes @xmath205 are solutions of the coupled evolution equations , which can be rewritten as @xmath206 , with @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",

    "the rest of the fields ( the inflaton non - zero modes and the gravitational waves ) , are supposed to start from the vacuum , and therefore they are semiclassically set to zero initially in the simulations .",
    "their coupling to the higgs modes will drive their evolution , giving rise to a rapid ( exponential ) growth of the gw and inflaton modes .",
    "their subsequent non - linear evolution will be well described by the lattice simulations .    in the next subsections",
    "we will describe the different evolution stages found in our simulations .",
    "in this subsection we will compare the analytical estimates with our numerical simulations for the initial tachyonic growth of the higgs modes and the subsequent growth of gravitational waves .",

    ". then we can assume than the time scale associated with bubble collisions is also @xmath273 .",
    "assuming the bubble walls contain most of the energy density , and since they travel close to the speed of light , see paper i , it is expected that the asymmetric collisions will copiously produce gw .    far from a source that produces gravitational radiation , the dominat contribution to the amplitude of gw is given by the acceleration of the quadrupole moment of the higgs field distribution . given the energy density of the higgs field , @xmath274 , we can compute the ( reduced ) quadrupole moment of the higgs field spatial distribution , @xmath275 , such that the amplitude of the gravitational radiation , in the tt gauge , is given by @xmath276 .",
    "a significant amount of energy can be emitted in the form of gravitational radiation whenever the quadrupole moment changes significantly fast : through the bubble collisions in this case .",
    "the power carried by these waves can be obtained via  ( [ rhototal ] ) as @xmath277 omitting indices for simplicity , as the power emitted in gravitational waves in the quadrupole approximation is of order @xmath278 , while the quadrupole moment is of order @xmath279 , we can estimate the power emitted in gw upon the collision of two higgs bubbles as @xmath280 the fraction of energy density carried by these waves , @xmath281 , compared to that of the initial energy stored in the two bubble - like structures of the higgs field , will be @xmath282 . since the expansion of the universe is negligible during the bubble collision stage , the energy that drives inflaton , @xmath283 , is transferred essentially to the higgs modes during preheating , within an order of magnitude , see fig .",
    "thus , recalling that @xmath284 , the total fraction of energy in gw produced during the bubble collisions to that stored in the higgs lumps formed at symmetry breaking , is given by @xmath285 giving an amplitude which is of the same order as is observed in the numerical simulations , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . of course",
    ", an exhaustive analytical treatment of the production of gw during this stage of bubble collisions remains to be done , but we leave it for a future publication .      the development of a turbulent stage is expected from the point of view of classical fields , as turbulence usually appears whenever there exists an active ( stationary ) source of energy localized at some scale @xmath286 in fourier space . as first pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , in reheating scenarios the coherently oscillating inflaton zero - mode plays the role of the pumping - energy source , acting at a well defined scale @xmath286 in fourier space , given by the frequency of the inflaton oscillations .",

    ", there is no other scale in fourier space where energy is accummulated , dissipated and/or infused .",
    "so , as turbulence is characterized by the transport of some conserved quantity , energy in our case , we should expect a flow of energy from @xmath286 towards higher ( direct cascade ) or smaller ( inverse cascade ) momentum modes . in typical turbulent regimes of classical fluids , there exits a sink in fourier space , corresponding to that scale at which the ( direct ) cascade stops and energy gets dissipated .",
    "however , in our problem there is no such sink so that the transported energy can not be dissipated , but instead it is used to populate high - momentum modes . for the problem at hand",

    "[ variances_fig ] we have plotted the time evolution of the variances of the inflaton @xmath30 and of the higgs modulus @xmath294 , and fitted the data with a power - law like  ( [ variances ] ) , obtaining    [ cols= \" > , > , < , < \" , ]     where the last brackets on the right correspond to the range in time ( in units of @xmath162 ) for which we fitted the data .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ variances_fig ] , the slope of the higgs field ( in logarithmic scale ) , @xmath295 , remains approximately constant in time , corresponding to a 4-field dominant interaction .",
    "however , the slope of the inflaton s variance increases in time , i.e. the critical exponent @xmath296 of the inflaton decreases , until it reaches a stationary stage at @xmath297 .",
    "since @xmath296 is related to the number @xmath171 of fields interacting in a collision , if there was a change from one dominant multi - field interaction to another , this should produce a time - dependent effective @xmath296 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ variances_fig ] .",
    "however , we will not try to explain here the origin of such an effective critical exponents as extracted from the simulations .",
    "we will just stress that we have checked the robustness of those values under different lattice configurations ( @xmath298 ) and different statistical realizations , discarding this way a possible lattice artefact effect . as we will see , the critical exponents @xmath299 determines the speed with which the turbulent particle distribution moves over momentum space , so this is a crucial parameter .",
    "moreover , although both the classical modes of the inflaton and the higgs contribute to the production of gw , the inflaton s occupation numbers decrease faster than those of the higgs so , after a given time , only the higgs modes remain as the main source of gw .",
    "actually , when turbulence is developed , it is expected that the distribution function of the classical turbulent fields , the inflaton and the higgs here , follow a self - similar evolution  @xcite @xmath300 with @xmath299 the critical exponent of the fields variances and @xmath301 a certain factor @xmath302 , which depends on the type of turbulence developed .",
    "it is precisely this way that the exponent @xmath299 determines the speed of the particles distribution in momentum space : given a specific scale @xmath303 such that , for example , the occupation number has a maximum , that scale evolves in time as @xmath304 .",
    "we have seen that the evolution of the higgs occupation number follows eq .",
    "( [ selfsimilar ] ) with @xmath305 , as expected from the higgs variance , and @xmath306 .",
    "whereas the evolution of the inflaton occupation number follows  ( [ selfsimilar ] ) even more accurately than the higgs , with an  effective \" exponent @xmath307 , and @xmath308 . since the slope of the inflaton s variance changes in time , the value of the exponents of the inflaton s scaling relation will require further investigation",
    "however , despite this time evolution of the inflaton variance , eq .",
    "( [ selfsimilar ] ) is very well fulfilled by the inflaton with the given effective exponents .",
    "so we can perfectly obtain the universal @xmath309 function for the inflaton as well as for the higgs .    in figs .",
    "[ higgsscaling_fig ] and  [ inflatonscaling_fig ] we have plotted the occupation numbers of the higgs and the inflaton , also inverting the relation of eq .",
    "( [ selfsimilar ] ) in order to extract the _ universal _ time - independent @xmath309 functions of each field . as shown in those figures , the distributions",
    "follow the expected scaling behaviour . however , for the range of interest of @xmath138 , there are small discrepancies of order 0.1 - 4% ( depending on @xmath138 ) among the different universal functions @xmath310 , as obtained inverting eq .",
    "( [ selfsimilar ] ) at different times @xmath311 .",
    "the universal functions @xmath309 plotted in figs .  [ higgsscaling_fig ] and  [ inflatonscaling_fig ] have been obtained from averaging over ten statistical realizations for each time .",
    "the advantage of the development of a turbulence behaviour is obvious : it allows us to extrapolate the time evolution of the fields distributions till later times beyond the one we can reach with the simulations .",
    "moreover , the fact that the turbulence develops so early after the tachyonic instability , also allow us to check for a long time of the simulation , the goodness of the description of the dynamics of the fields , given by the turbulent kinetic theory developed in ref .",
    "we have fitted the averaged universal functions @xmath309 with expressions of the form @xmath312 , with @xmath313 and @xmath314 polynomials in @xmath138 , giving : @xmath315 there is no fundamental meaning for these expressions , but it is very useful to have such an analytical control over @xmath309 , since this allows us to track the time - evolution of @xmath316 through eq .",
    "( [ selfsimilar ] ) . actually , the classical regime of the evolution of some bosonic fields ends when the system can be relaxed to the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "we are now going to estimate the moment in which the initial energy density gets fully transferred to the higgs classical modes . using eq.([selfsimilar ] ) and",
    "the fit  ( [ higgs_universal ] ) , we find that the initial energy density is totally transfered to the higgs when ( in units @xmath317 ) @xmath318 where we have assumed that the higgs modes have energy @xmath319 . in our case , with @xmath320 , the conversion of the initial energy density into higgs particles and therefore into radiation is complete by @xmath321 .",
    "therefore , if we consider this value as a lower bound for the time that classical turbulence requires to end , we see that turbulence last for a very long time compared to the time - scale of the initial tachyonic and bubbly stages .",
    "thus , if gw were significatively sourced during turbulence , one should take into account corrections from the expansion of the universe .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , we show the evolution of the gw spectra up to times mt @xmath322 , for a lattice of ( n,@xmath323 ) = ( 128,.15 ) . it is clear from that figure that the amplitude of the gw saturates to a value of order @xmath324 . at mt @xmath325 , the maximum amplitude of the spectra has already reached @xmath326 , while at time mt @xmath327 , the maximum has only grown a factor of 2 with respect to mt @xmath328 . from times",
    "mt @xmath329 till the maximum time we reached in the simulations , mt = 2000 , the maximum of the amplitude of the spectrum does not seem to change significantly , slowly increasing from @xmath330 to @xmath331 . despite this saturation ,",
    "we see in the simulations that the the long momentum tail of the spectrum keeps moving towards greater values .",
    "this displacement is precisely what one would expect from turbulence , although it is clear that the amplitude of the new high momentum modes never exceed that of lower momentum . in order to disscard",
    "that this displacement towards the uv is not a numerical artefact , one should further investigate the role played by the turbulent scalar fields as a source of gw . here , we just want to remark that the turbulent motions of the scalar fields , seem not to increase significatively anymore the total amplitude of the gw spectrum .",
    "indeed , in a recent paper @xcite where gw production at reheating is also considered , it is stated that gw production from turbulent motion of classical scalar fields , should be very supressed .",
    "that is apparently what we observe in our simulations although , as pointed above , this issue should be investigated in a more detailed way . anyway , here we can conclude that the expansion of the universe during reheating in these hybrid models , does not play an important role during the time of gw production , and therefore we can be safely ignore it .    , @xmath332 .",
    "in the left picture we show a spatial section of @xmath333 .",
    "we can see how a spherical lump is growhing . in the right picture",
    "we can see the structure of the @xmath334 in the same place .",
    "a ring is forming around the higgs lump .",
    "more complex structures are formed in the regions in which the higgs bubbles are next , and the gw grow in the boundary of this lumps , where the gradient of the higgs and therefore the @xmath77 tensor grow in this region.,width=283,height=548 ]",
    "in this section , we show a sequence of snapshots ( @xmath335 ) of the evolution of the spatial distribution , before the fields are driven to the turbulent stage .",
    "we find that the first stages of the gw dynamics is strongly correlated with the dynamics of the higgs oscillations that give rise to symmetry breaking . a qualitative way of understanding this question is to analyse the spatial structure of the @xmath77 tensor , built from spatial gradients of the higgs and inflaton fields .",
    "since the oscillations of @xmath336 are due to rapid changes of the higgs values in its way of symmetry breaking , this induces great variations in the behaviour of the spatial gradients .",
    "we are now going to analyse briefly the different stages showing the most representatives images .",
    "shortly , it will be available in our web page , a bigger selection of pictures and movies @xcite .",
    "an interesting conclusion from the set of figs .",
    "[ fig : ring1 ] @xmath17 [ fig : compression2 ] is that the higgs evolution from lump growth , through invagination to bubble collisions , has a direct translation into the corresponding growth of gravitational wave energy density . not only does the volume - averaged amplitude @xmath337 follow the higgs time evolution , but the individual local features in the gwb seem to correspond very closely with the higgs features .",
    "in the first stage both higgs and gw backgrounds grow very fast . the lumps which grow in the higgs background induce structures around these , through the gradients appearing in the @xmath77 tensor .",
    "the geometry of the gravitational structures comes from the position of the higgs lump .",
    "a typical structure for an isolated lump is a ring of gravitational waves , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ring1 ] .",
    "more complex structures can be formed around the position of the higgs lumps . before symmetry breaking these lumps",
    "grow according to the previous analysis , generating domains with a great density of gravitational energy .",
    "the second stage begins when @xmath338 and the symmetry breaking starts , then the higgs lumps invaginate and expand , producing the growth of gravitational waves around of these structures , see figs .",
    "[ fig : bubble_expansion1 ] and [ fig : bubble_expansion2 ] , one can see that whenever the bubble walls expand , the variation in the gradient of the higgs field induces the expansion of the gw ring . in the case of the rings ,",
    "if the lump is very isolated , the expansion induces the ring to dilute and disappear , by gauss law . in practice , however , the lumps are never isolated and bubbles collide before the gradients ( and thus the gw ) die away .    in the case when two higgs bubble - like structures are close by",
    ", the expansion of their walls compresses the gw structures .",
    "this expansion continues until the first higgs oscillation , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . if the distance between higgs structures is small , then the gw can be diluted , whereas in the other case , a remnant string - like gw structure survives , and when the higgs background goes to zero this gw structure becomes divided into two waves that propagate in opposite directions , as one can see in figs .",
    "[ fig : compression1 ] and [ fig : compression2 ] , which show four snapshots of this process .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in the second oscillations .    finally , the wave fronts propagate , colliding among themselves , driving the system to the stage of turbulence .",
    "we will leave for a future publication the detailed analysis of the gw production at the bubble collisions and the subsequent turbulent period .",

    "using this fact , kt estimated analytically the amplitude of the power spectra of gw for the low frequency end of the spectrum , corresponding to wavelengths of order the size of the horizon at rescattering .",

    "in particular , we will concentrate only in an scenario with a massless inflaton @xmath30 , either accompanied or not by an extra scalar field @xmath31 . in the following , we will describe the numerical results for gw production at reheating in such scenarios , described by the potential @xmath339 rescaling the time by @xmath340 and the physical fields by a conformal transformation as @xmath341 then the equations of motion of the inflaton and of the extra scalar field , eqs .",
    "( [ inflatoneq ] ) and ( [ scalareq ] ) , can be rewritten in terms of the conformal variables as @xmath342 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to conformal time . since the universe expands as radiation - like in these scenarios , @xmath343 ,",

    "@xcite and  @xcite , we set @xmath348 and @xmath349 = 120 . since , this case is also computed in  @xcite , we can also compare our results with theirs .",

    "the most remarkable fact , is that we also confirm that the peak structure in the gw power spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , remains clearly visible at times much later than the one at which those peaks have dissapeared in the scalar fields power spectrum .",
    "so , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this characteristic feature distinguish this particular model from any other .",
    "let us emphasize that we have run the simulations till times much greater than that of the end of the resonance stage , both for the pure and the coupled case .",
    "the role of the turbulence period after preheating seems , therefore , not to be very important , despite its long duration .",
    "apparently , the _ no - go _ theorem about the suppresion of gw at turbulence , discussed in  @xcite , is fulfilled . in refs .  @xcite it was pointed out that gauge couplings or trilinear interactions could be responsible for a fast thermalization of the universe after inflation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but as long as this takes place after the end of the resonace stage , in principle this should not affect the results shown above .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that hybrid models are very efficient generators of gravitational waves at preheating , in three well defined stages , first via the tachyonic growth of higgs modes , whose gradients act as sources of gravity waves ; then via the collisions of highly relativistic bubble - like structures with large amounts of energy density , and finally via the turbulent regime ( although this effect does not seem to be very significant in the presence of scalar sources ) , which drives the system towards thermalization .",
    "these waves remain decoupled since the moment of their production , and thus the predicted amplitude and shape of the gravitational wave spectrum today can be used as a probe of the reheating period in the very early universe .",
    "the characteristic spectrum can be used to distinguish between this stochastic background and others , like those arising from ns - ns and bh - bh coalescence , which are decreasing with frequency , or those arising from inflation , that are flat  @xcite .",
    "+ we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the sensitivity of planned gw interferometers like ligo , lisa and bbo , together with the present bounds from cmb anisotropies ( gut inflation ) , from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and from milisecond pulsars ( ms pulsar ) .",
    "also shown are the expected stochastic backgrounds of chaotic inflation models like @xmath24 , both coupled and pure , as well as the predicted background from two different hybrid inflation models , a high - scale model , with @xmath358 and @xmath359 , and a low - scale model , with @xmath360 and @xmath361 , corresponding to a rate of expansion @xmath362 gev .",
    "the high - scale hybrid model produces typically as much gravitational waves from preheating as the chaotic inflation models .",
    "the advantage of low - scale hybrid models of inflation is that the background produced is within reach of future gw detectors like bbo  @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that future high frequency laser interferometers could be sensitive to a gwb in the mhz region  @xcite , although they are still far from the bound marked with an interrogation sign .    for a high - scale model of inflation , we may never see the predicted gw background coming from preheating , in spite of its large amplitude , because it appears at very high frequencies , where no detector has yet shown to be sufficiently sensitive . on the other hand ,",
    "if inflation occured at low scales , even though we will never have a chance to detect the gw produced during inflation in the polarization anisotropies of the cmb , we do expect gravitational waves from preheating to contribute with an important background in sensitive detectors like bbo .",
    "the detection and characterization of such a gw background , coming from the complicated and mostly unknown epoch of rehating of the universe , may open a new window into the very early universe , while providing a new test on inflationary cosmology .",

    "<S> the reheating of the universe after hybrid inflation proceeds through the nucleation and subsequent collision of large concentrations of energy density in the form of bubble - like structures moving at relativistic speeds . </S>",
    "<S> this generates a significant fraction of energy in the form of a stochastic background of gravitational waves , whose time evolution is determined by the successive stages of reheating : first , tachyonic preheating makes the amplitude of gravity waves grow exponentially fast . </S>",
    "<S> second , bubble collisions add a new burst of gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> third , turbulent motions finally sets the end of gravitational waves production . from then on , </S>",
    "<S> these waves propagate unimpeded to us . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the fraction of energy density today in these primordial gravitational waves could be significant for gut - scale models of inflation , although well beyond the frequency range sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories like ligo , lisa or bbo . </S>",
    "<S> however , low - scale models could still produce a detectable signal at frequencies accessible to bbo or decigo . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we have also computed the analogous gravitational wave background from some chaotic inflation models and obtained results similar to those found by other groups . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of such a background would open a new observational window into the very early universe , where the details of the process of reheating , i.e. the big bang , could be explored . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it could also serve in the future as a new experimental tool for testing the inflationary paradigm . </S>"
