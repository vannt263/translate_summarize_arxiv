    ".35 cm    there are two bright su uma stars in the _ kepler _ field exhibiting a variety of temporal behavior that make them worthy of a detailed statistical study of their outbursts , v1504 cyg ( _ kepler _ i d 7446357 ; @xmath14 ) and v344 lyr ( _ kepler _ i d 7659570 ; @xmath15 ) .",

    "previous studies of the _ kepler _ data on su uma stars have found quiescent superhumps in v344 lyr ( still et al .",
    "2010 ) , presented numerical models of the long term light curve of v344 lyr ( cannizzo et al .",
    "2010 ; hereafter c10 ) , and studied superhumps , both positive and negative , in the long term v344 lyr light curve ( wood et al .",
    "2011 ) .     .35 cm    statistical studies of dne have been useful in delineating the long - term properties of outbursts , e.g .. , the outburst duration , recurrence times , and quiescent intervals , and placing physical constraints on models of outbursts ( e.g. , campbell & shapley 1940 , sterne , campbell & shapley 1940 , bath & van paradijs 1983 , van paradijs 1983 , szkody & mattei 1984 , cannizzo & mattei 1992 , 1998 , ak , et al .",
    "2002 , simon 2004 ) .",
    "several interesting studies of the su uma stars have been carried out .",
    "for instance , van paradijs ( 1983 ) studied the variation in outburst duration @xmath16 with orbital period for 15 dne spanning the @xmath17 hr cv period gap .",
    "he found that short outburst durations increase with orbital period , whereas long outburst durations are relatively constant with orbital period .",
    "therefore for the su uma systems , which lie at short orbital period , the ratio @xmath18 is large .",
    "the relation of superoutbursts to normal outbursts for dne below the period gap and the relation of long outbursts to normal outbursts for dne above the period gap are part of a general trend ; superoutbursts are just long outbursts in short orbital period dne .",
    "this finding was amplified by ak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) using a larger sample . in this work",
    "we seek to extend previous studies by analyzing the high fidelity _ kepler _ light curves of two su uma stars to investigate the properties of the outbursts . in section 2",
    "we examine the outburst properties of the nos and sos , in section 3 we discuss the results , in particular the scaling of the so decay rate with orbital period , and in section 4 we summarize our results .",
    "the relatively small number of total outbursts observed in the two systems to date does not yet allow one to amass detailed frequency histogram distributions , as was done for instance by cannizzo & mattei ( 1992 ) for the @xmath0700 outbursts observed up to that time in ss cyg . however , the variations of the outburst duration @xmath16 and intervening quiescent interval @xmath19 within a supercycle contain information which can potentially guide theoretical models .",
    "for instance , in the thermal - tidal model for the supercycle in the su uma systems ( ichikawa & osaki 1992 , 1994 ; ichikawa , hirose , & osaki 1993 ) , one sees a monotonically increasing sequence of no quiescent intervals leading up to a so .",
    "now with the exquisite _ kepler _ data , this can be directly tested .",
    "the nos of the fainter su uma stars such as v344 lyr have been poorly characterized prior to _ kepler _ due to their intrinsic faintness ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of kato et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present the currently available long term light curves for v1504 cyg and v344 lyr . to obtain the apparent _ kepler _ magnitude from the original data , electron flux per cadence , a correspondence of @xmath20 to @xmath21 @xmath22 cadence@xmath3 was adopted .",
    "each light curve encompasses six sos ; v1504 cyg had 59 nos while v344 lyr had 58 .",
    "two systematic effects are worth noting : ( i ) there are gaps in the data due to monthly data downloads , quarterly @xmath23 spacecraft rolls , and spacecraft safe modes .",
    "( ii ) in addition , there is no long - term absolute flux calibration for _ kepler _ ( haas et al .",
    "2010 , koch et al .",
    "2010 ) : ( 1 ) target masks do not contain all the flux from the target . the aperture is chosen to maximize a varying s / n over the whole quarter . as _",
    "kepler _ orbits the sun , however , targets drift across the mask as a result of differential velocity aberration .",
    "varying amounts of target flux fall outside of the pixel aperture over the quarter , so the target flux tends to vary smoothly over the quarter due to this effect .",
    "another contributing factor to this effect is focus variation due to the thermal behavior following spacecraft slews , especially immediately after earth pointings for data download , or safe modes .",
    "( 2 ) after each _ kepler _ rotation , the target falls on a different ccd chip with a different psf and the target is centered differently , e.g. , perhaps on a pixel boundary rather than a pixel center .",
    "the 4 arcsec pixels undersample the psf .",
    "this means that the pixel mask changes shape and size each quarter , with different amount of light losses .",
    "( 3 ) with different shaped masks , the number and amount of contaminating sources in the mask will differ across the quarter gap .",
    "the lack of long term flux calibration is evident in the elevated flux level seen in v1504 cyg during @xmath24 ( i.e , q2 of observations ) .",
    "in addition the secular trending of the flux calibration within a given quarter may account for the apparent @xmath050 d @xmath25folding decrease of the quiescent level following the first two sos in v344 lyr , both of which occurred just after a roll maneuver . in view of these considerations , we limit our attention in this study to timescales rather than amplitudes .     -3.5",
    "cm    in a standard light curve plot of magnitude versus time , a straight line decay means that the flux @xmath26 , which we would therefore refer to as an exponential decay . a decay which deviates from exponential could be concave upward ( slower - than - exponential ) , concave downward ( faster - than - exponential ) , or some more complicated shape",
    "the decays of the nos are faster - than - exponential , which obviates theoretical studies that attempt to introduce a weak radial power law dependency into the ss @xmath12 parameter in order to get precisely exponential decays ( e.g. , ichikawa , hirose , & osaki 1993 ; cannizzo 1994 )",
    ". we may quantify the deviation from exponentiality in the no decays by dividing the decay into bins , each spanning a small range @xmath27 , and calculating the locally defined decay rate @xmath28(d mag@xmath3 ) within each bin .",
    "dividing the decay into a total of 10 bins for each star , we take @xmath29 for v1504 cyg and @xmath30 for v344 lyr . for demonstration purposes , the binning distribution for the decay of the first no in v344 lyr",
    "is shown in figure 3 . within each bin",
    "we compute a frequency histogram distribution of @xmath28 values for all no decays .",
    "the results are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "the small numbers in each panel indicate the magnitude range in @xmath31 measured from the local maximum for each no .",
    "thus , the upper panels show the decay rates computed near maximum light , and as one progresses to lower panels one is sampling the fainter portions .",
    "for both systems one sees a shifting in the centroid of the frequency histogram distribution to lower @xmath28 values as the decay proceeds , equivalent to saying that the decays are concave downward . in both systems , the parts of the decays fainter than about 1 mag below no maximum asymptote to a centroid median of @xmath00.6@xmath20.7 d mag@xmath3 .",
    "thus the concave - downward aspect of the no decays is due in large part to the rounded maxima ; by the time the no has faded to within @xmath32 mag of quiescence , the rest of the decay is closely exponential .",
    "-2.75 cm     -2.75 cm    bailey ( 1975 ) discovered that the decay rate for nos is correlated with orbital period ( see his figure 1 for eight well - studied systems ) , and derived the empirical relation @xmath33 d mag@xmath3 @xmath34 .",
    "smak ( 1984 ) was the first to show that this relation can be used to infer @xmath4 .",
    "subsequent work confirmed and expanded on this finding ( cannizzo 2001a ) .",
    "warner ( 1995b ) looked at a larger sample than bailey and deduced the fit @xmath35 d mag@xmath3 @xmath36 .",
    "for the two systems of interest in this study , for which @xmath14 ( v1504 cyg ) and 2.1 ( v344 lyr ) , respectively , the predictions for the rates of decay would be 0.64 and 0.80 d mag@xmath3 from the original bailey relation , and 0.82 and 0.99 d mag@xmath3 from the warner fit .",
    "the presently determined values @xmath00.7 d mag@xmath3 in v1504 cyg and @xmath00.6 d mag@xmath3 in v344 lyr for the faintest bins are closer to bailey s original expression .",
    "if one averaged over the entire decay , the values would be larger , closer to warner s expression . the precision of the current determinations are limited by the small number of total nos in both systems . with time",
    ", better statistics will allow better determinations , as has been done for instance with ss cyg ( cannizzo & mattei 1998 , see their figure 6 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the outburst durations @xmath16 for the two systems .",
    "based on the magnitude range for outbursts in the two systems , we use a cut of @xmath37 in v1504 cyg and @xmath38 in v344 lyr to define outburst onset and termination .",
    "there is an obvious trend of increasing outburst width @xmath16 between consecutive sos : during a supercycle , @xmath16 increases by @xmath020@xmath270% .",

    "figure 8 shows the quiescent intervals @xmath19 between successive outbursts . in both systems",
    "there is a general trend of @xmath19 values that increase to a local maximum about mid - way between successive sos . for the last half of the v1504 cyg light curve and the first half of the v344 lyr light curve",
    "this effect is quite pronounced .",
    "in is interesting that while the values of @xmath39 and @xmath19 from one no to the next are fairly continuous , even across an so , the @xmath16 values show a sharp discontinuity across an so , resetting to a much smaller value .    at roughly the time of the third so in v1504 cyg , strong negative superhumps appear ( wood et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) and persist through the end of the light curve .",
    "the presence of negative superhumps indicates that the mass is not accreting primarily at the rim of the disk .",
    "although there is not an obvious change in @xmath39 at this time , it is perhaps noteworthy that @xmath19 increases .",
    "this may indicate a strong drop in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star , which would increase the recurrence time for outbursts . in the magnetic systems such as am her , which lack accretion disks ,",
    "one has direct evidence for the instantaneous mass transfer rate from the secondary stars in the long term light curves , and one does often see intervals during which the mass transfer rate reduces to a low level ( e.g. , hessman , gnsicke , & mattei 2000 ) .",

    "the @xmath16 sequence shows an increase between sos in both systems .",
    "this is consistent with a secular increase in the mass of the accretion disk .",
    "the @xmath19 values , by contrast , increase to a local maximum roughly half way between sos before returning to their initial small value by the time the next so begins . thus the @xmath19 values are roughly continuous across sos . in both systems",

    "the physics behind the viscosity in quiescence is unknown at present , and one could in principle have large variations in @xmath5 between systems at similar orbital periods .",
    "let us go back to the definition of the viscous time scale @xmath69 .",
    "since the controlling time scale in this situation is the slowest one , this expression is to be evaluated at the outer disk radius @xmath70 . following cannizzo ( 2001b )",
    ", we consider the hot state of the disk by adopting a rosseland mean opacity @xmath71 g @xmath72 and mean molecular weight @xmath73 .",
    "we can then write the viscous time as @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the surface density at the outer disk edge .    looking at this expression , we see that the warner ( 1995a , 1995b ) equation already contained an implicit assumption about @xmath78 , as it only contains @xmath13 and @xmath34 . to derive a more meaningful expression for @xmath79 in the context of sos we need to take into account two additional pieces of information , namely that during a so essentially all the mass accumulated during quiescence is accreted onto the wd , and thereby lost from the disk , and also that the accumulated mass depends on the critical surface density @xmath80 , which depends in turn on @xmath5 .",
    "this scaling is given by ( lasota 2001 ) @xmath81 since the attainment of @xmath80 is the triggering mechanism for a dn outburst , the quiescence disk mass @xmath0@xmath82 at the time of so onset can be written as @xmath83    once the so has started , the mass that was present in the non - steady state quiescent disk gets redistributed into a quasi - steady disk with @xmath84 constant , and therefore with a radial profile @xmath85 ( ss ) . therefore the mass of the hot disk can be written as @xmath86 since the ratio @xmath54 is large in su uma systems , a substantial amount of mass needs to drain onto the wd before the surface is depleted enough for the cooling wave to start .",
    "we now set @xmath87 equal to its standard functional form for a ss disk with gas pressure and free - free opacity , @xmath88 .",

    "in extreme mass ratio systems such as the su uma stars , the roche lobe of the primary asymptotes to @xmath00.82 of the binary separation ( eggleton 1983 ) . also , the relation between orbital separation and orbital period is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the orbital separation in units of @xmath94 cm .",

    "therefore if we associate the rate of so decay , expressed in d mag@xmath3 , with the viscous time at the outer edge , which is an @xmath25folding time , then equation ( [ visc3 ] ) needs to be corrected by a factor 0.924 .    by comparing the so decay rates of v1504 cyg and v344 lyr , we infer a decay rate @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , adopting @xmath99 for the su uma systems gives @xmath100 , and therefore @xmath101 solving for the constant and exponent in the @xmath5 scaling gives @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath2 a steep dependence of @xmath5 on orbital period .",

    "in a recent study of the aggregate properties of dne , patterson ( 2011 , see his figure 11 ) finds that the recurrence time for sos has a steep inverse relation with binary mass ratio @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
    "since the secondaries in cataclysmic variables are , by definition , in contact with their roche lobes , this implies that @xmath110 scales with orbital period , and hence @xmath111 .",
    "given that ( 1 ) sos accrete virtually all their stored mass @xmath112 , ( 2 ) the mass feeding rate into the outer disk from the secondary @xmath113 is thought to be relatively constant at @xmath0@xmath114 for systems below the period gap ( kolb et al .",
    "1998 ; howell et al .",
    "2001 ) , and ( 3 ) the recurrence time ( cannizzo et al . 1988 ) @xmath115 it is quite surprising that @xmath116 apparently has a strong inverse relation with orbital period . as one progresses to shorter orbital period ,",
    "one expects more frequent sos since the disks are smaller and the critical mass is reached more quickly .",
    "we are seemingly drawn to the same conclusion as previously , that @xmath5 must have a strong dependence on orbital period .",
    "howell et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see their figure 2 , panel ( a ) ) indicates a rough dependence @xmath117 for the su uma stars .",
    "if we again set @xmath118 , substitute @xmath34 for @xmath70 in equation ( [ joe ] ) , and solve for @xmath119 , we obtain @xmath120 .",
    "if the overall trend in @xmath28 for long outbursts between wz sge and u gem , which is roughly matched ( coincidentally ) by that between v1504 cyg and v344 lyr , is real , then two independent lines of reasoning imply a very steep dependence of @xmath5 on orbital period .",
    "why should one have @xmath121 constant , while at the same time @xmath118 , where @xmath122 ?",
    "current thinking on the physical mechanism for viscosity in accretion disks centers on the magnetorotational instability ( mri - balbus & hawley 1998 ) , an instability based on the shearing amplification of a weak magnetic field .",
    "the nonlinear saturation limit of the mri in ionized gas is thought to explain why @xmath1230.1 ( mckinney & narayan 2007a , 2007b ) .",
    "however , as the disk cools to the quiescent state and the supply of free electrons drops precipitously due to the exponential dependence of partial ionization on temperature below @xmath0@xmath124 k , the magnetic field no longer couples effectively to the gas , and fails to provide an effective viscosity .",
    "menou ( 2000 ) tried to model the complete accretion disk limit cycle model for dne using only the mri , and failed .",
    "he discussed the failure of the mri in quiescence , and predicted that if tidal torques ( a completely different physical mechanism from the mri ) dominate the angular momentum transport in the quiescent accretion disks in the su uma stars , one would expect an anticorrelation between @xmath116 and @xmath125 .",
    "he presents data for six su uma stars showing an anticorrelation .",
    "( patterson [ 2011 ] shows the anticorrelation in much greater detail . )",
    "menou notes that theories of tidally induced spiral waves or shock waves indicate a strong correlation between effective torque and @xmath125 ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 ; goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) .",
    "our finding @xmath126 seems to support the view that tidal torquing is the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism operating in quiescent accretion disks in interacting binaries .",
    "for completeness we note that previous workers have commented on the apparent necessity of small @xmath5 to obtain the large amplitude sos and long recurrence times in the short orbital period dne .",
    "for example meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the large required stored disk mass and outburst long recurrence time in wz sge mandated @xmath127 in the disk instability model .",
    "meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1999 ) argued for a possible physical cause in the loss of coronal activity in the very cool atmospheres of the low mass k - type secondaries expected in such short orbital period systems , resulting in lower magnetic fields in the material entrained in the l1 point as it feeds the outer accretion disk .",
    "however , in view of the findings of menou ( 2000 ) showing the lack of mri in quiescent disks , and the fact that if the mri were operating the strength of the final field within the disk would be unrelated to the amplitude of the seed field , we find the tidal torquing arguments more persuasive .",
    "the @xmath5 value strongly influences two observables , the decay time of the viscous plateaus , and the recurrence times for outburst .",
    "it is important to verify whether the steep @xmath5 relation mandated by the wz sge @xmath2 u gem trend shown in figure 11 is consistent with the observed recurrence times for the two systems . in other words , does the relation @xmath128 applied to both wz sge and u gem lead to reasonable recurrence times for both systems ? for wz sge , @xmath129 implies @xmath130 . from smak ( 1993 ) and",
    "steeghs et al .",
    "( 2007 ) we have @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 g s@xmath3 .",
    "( smak s value for @xmath113 may be too low , as it is below the floor value expected solely from gravitational radiation [ howell et al .",
    "2001 ] . ) using the value for the stored quiescent mass from equation ( 7 ) gives @xmath134 g. thus the recurrence time for sos from equation ( 13 ) is @xmath135 yr , versus the observed recurrence time for superoutbursts in wz sge ( no normal outbursts are seen ) of @xmath136 yr . for a standard value given by gravitational radiation induced mass transfer below the period gap @xmath137",
    ", the recurrence time would be @xmath138 yr . for u gem , @xmath139 implies @xmath140 , from smak ( 2001 ) we have @xmath141 , @xmath142 , orbital separation @xmath143 cm @xmath144 cm , and @xmath145 . from equation ( 7 ) , @xmath146 g for the stored mass . given a mass transfer rate typical of systems above the period gap @xmath147 we use equation ( 13 ) to arrive at a recurrence time @xmath148 d. the observed recurrence time for outbursts in u gem is @xmath149 d , and for long outbursts only it is @xmath150 d ( since the outburst pattern basically alternates between long and short outbursts ) .",
    "the long outbursts are more relevant as regards the recurrence time scale obtained from equation ( 13 ) since it is assumed most of the stored mass accretes .",
    "thus for both wz sge and u gem the theoretical and observed recurrence times for long outbursts agree to within a factor of @xmath151 , indicating both systems can have the same scaling of @xmath5 on binary orbital period . since the orbital periods of the two systems are quite different , their values of @xmath5 are quite different .",
    "the @xmath25folding decay times @xmath152 d for the mass of the accretion disk during so in v1504 cyg and v344 lyr represent @xmath153 orbital time scales in the outer disk @xmath154 540 s @xmath155 .",
    "in other words @xmath156 .",
    "the latest mri simulations of accretion disks , which should be applicable to the outburst state of dne , are not yet sophisticated enough to be directly compared to sos .",
    "for instance , sorathia et al . (",
    "2011 ) perform global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks which span a dynamic range of only a factor of four in disk radii .",
    "they also neglect the vertical dependence of the gravitational potential , which does not allow the effects of magnetic buoyancy in reducing the magnetic pressure within the body of the disk . in their simulations",
    "they find @xmath157 for the depletion of accretion disk mass .",
    "nevertheless their results are quite interesting in the context of our work because they show that the shakura - sunyaev @xmath12 values determined from the local @xmath158 and @xmath159 components of the magnetic field are about an order of magnitude lower than those determined from the averaged viscous time scale in the outer disk ( equivalent to the global decay rate of the disk mass ) , which is the more relevant determination in the context of comparison with dn decay rates .",
    "king , pringle , & livio ( 2007 ) noted a factor @xmath160 discrepancy between observationally determined @xmath13 values and those calculated numerically from mri simulations ( the mri values being too small ) . although the local shearing box simulations cited by king et al . have been strongly criticized because of convergence issues ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 ) , the global calculations of sorathia et al .",
    "also give @xmath161 . if the general trend between two methods of @xmath13 determinations by sorathia et al .",
    "are confirmed in more sophisticated global mri calculations with larger @xmath162 and realistic vertical stratification , that may resolve the current apparent discrepancy between theory and observation .     -4.75",
    "we have analyzed long term _ kepler _",
    "light curves of v1504 cyg , containing 65 outbursts , and v344 lyr , containing 64 outbursts . each system showed six superoutbursts .",
    "the findings are :    \\(1 ) the no decays are faster - than - exponential , with most of the deviation occurring near maximum light . near quiescence",
    "the decays are close to exponential , @xmath00.7 d mag@xmath3 for v1504 cyg and @xmath00.6 d mag@xmath3 for v344 lyr .",
    "these rates are in line with that expected from the bailey relation .",
    "our values are based on frequency histogram distributions of only @xmath050 nos and should improve as more outbursts are accumulated .",
    "\\(2 ) the no outburst durations @xmath16 increase by a factor @xmath01.2@xmath21.9 over the time interval between consecutive superoutbursts , resetting to a small value after a superoutburst .",
    "this is consistent with a monotonic increase of the accretion disk mass with each successive no .",
    "\\(3 ) the quiescent intervals @xmath19 between normal outbursts show a general trend in both systems of increasing to a local maximum about mid - way between superoutbursts .",
    "( there was also an anomalously long quiescence interval at the start of the v344 lyr light curve , potentially the result of a tilted disk . )",
    "this behavior for @xmath19 is inconsistent with osaki s thermal tidal instability model for sos , in which one expects a monotonic increase in @xmath19 values accompanying the monotonic build - up in disk mass and angular momentum leading to a so .",
    "if @xmath19 is correlated with the no triggering radius @xmath163 , then @xmath163 moves outward with each successive no only through roughly the first half of a supercycle , and then recedes .",
    "\\(5 ) the inference of the steep relation @xmath165 gives strength to the notion of tidal torquing as the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism operating in quiescent accretion disks in interacting binaries .    if one considers the slow decay rate of the long , viscous outbursts spanning dne from wz sge to u gem , one infers an overall variation @xmath166 .",
    "it is unfortunate that only one long outburst in one dn longward of the @xmath17 hr period gap exhibited enough dynamic variation in flux during its plateau phase that a decay rate can be reliably extracted for the slow decay portion .",
    "it is fortuitous , given the general scatter in dn outburst properties at a given orbital period , that the decay rate between v1504 cyg and v344 lyr shows a similar law @xmath167 .",
    "these dependencies are much steeper than the @xmath64 expected from the previous theoretical expression , due to warner ( 1995a , 1995b ) . by starting with the definition for the viscous time scale in the outer disk during superoutburst , and taking into account the scaling for material accumulated during quiescence",
    ", we derive a more physically motivated formula , and find that a steep dependence of the quiescent state value of @xmath12 is required , @xmath168 . in simple terms , the dramatic increase in stored quiescent mass with decreasing orbital period brings about a decrease in the viscous time scale of matter in the superoutburst disk , which is formed out of redistributed gas from the quiescent state .",
    "recent work by patterson ( 2011 ) on the recurrence time scale in su uma stars for sos also supports a steep dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath34 .",
    "the long outbursts in systems above the period gap and superoutbursts in systems below the gap both represent viscous decays , with the absence of transition waves in the disk .",
    "it is somewhat counterintuitive that the recurrence time for these long , viscous outbursts varies as @xmath169 , and yet their decay time varies as @xmath170 .",
    "the steepness of the @xmath171 relation explains why accretion disk modelers have had to adopt such small @xmath5 values for the su uma stars , compared to dne above the period gap , and also probably accounts for the fact that the extreme mass ratio black hole transient systems undergoing limit cycle accretion disk outbursts , like a0620 - 00 , have such long recurrence times for outbursts .",
    "the _ kepler _ data have already provided important constraints on the physics of accretion disks , in particular the shakura - sunyaev @xmath12 parameter : c10 showed that an interpolation between @xmath5 and @xmath13 based on the degree of partial ionization of gas was needed to account for the shoulders in the sos of v344 lyr , and in this work we have shown that the scaling of so decay rate with orbital period mandates a steep dependence of @xmath5 on orbital period , enforcing the notion of tidal torquing as being the dominant viscosity mechanism in quiescent accretion disks .",
