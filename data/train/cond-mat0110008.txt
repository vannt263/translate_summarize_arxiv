    "in some recent publications@xcite , we investigated the critical behavior of a @xmath0-state ferromagnetic potts model on a class of hierarchical diamond lattices with aperiodic interactions . taking advantage of the lattice structure , and assuming a ( layered ) distribution of exchange interactions according to suitable two - letter substitution rules , we were able to write exact recursion relations in order to characterize the critical behavior under the influence of geometric fluctuations .",
    "for disordered ferromagnetic systems , the well - known harris criterion predicts a change in critical behavior if the underlying uniform system displays a positive specific heat critical exponent .",
    "an extension of this heuristic criterion has been proposed by luck@xcite in order to gauge the relevance of geometric fluctuations associated with aperiodicity .",
    "we derived an exact expression of an analog of luck s criterion on a hierarchical lattice . for weak fluctuations",
    ", there is a nontrivial symmetric fixed point in parameter space that leads to the same critical behavior of the uniform model . for strong enough fluctuations ,",
    "this symmetric fixed point becomes fully unstable , and there appears a cycle - two in parameter space , that is shown to lead to a novel class of ( aperiodic ) critical behavior @xcite . as the systems are quite simple , it has been feasible to perform a direct thermodynamic analysis of the free energy to check the predictions of scaling arguments .",
    "now we review and extend these calculations . in section",
    "ii , we show that the same results are obtained for a @xmath0-state potts model on a necklace hierarchical lattice .",
    "although the critical temperature may change , critical exponents associated with either the symmetric fixed point or the cycle - two attractor do display universal features that do not depend on the particular choice of diamond or necklace hierarchical structures ( and on particular values of the interaction energies ) . in section iii , we consider a model of two directed polymers on a diamond lattice@xcite with a ( layered ) distribution of aperiodic interactions , according to some two - letter substitution rules .",
    "the exact recursion relations in parameter space turn out to be very simple , but with a similar structure as in the case of the aperiodic potts model .",
    "we then present some examples to show that , for relevant geometric fluctuations , a symmetric fixed point becomes fully unstable and there is again a novel cycle - two attractor of saddle - point character in parameter space .",
    "the successive application of the period - doubling two - letter rule , @xmath1 on an initial letter @xmath2 , produces the sequence @xmath3 at each stage of this construction , the numbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of letters @xmath2 and @xmath6 , can be obtained from the recursion relations @xmath7 where the eigenvalues , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , of the substitution matrix @xmath10 govern most of the geometric properties of this sequence@xcite . at order @xmath11 ,",
    "we can write @xmath12 from which we have the asymptotic expressions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for large values of @xmath11 , where @xmath15 can be regarded as a fluctuation around an asymptotic value . as the total number of letters , at order @xmath11 ,",
    "is given by @xmath16 , we have @xmath17 , with the wandering exponent @xmath18    the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model is given by the hamiltonian @xmath19 where @xmath20 , at all sites of a lattice , @xmath21 , and the sum refers to nearest - neighbor pairs of sites ( for @xmath22 , we regain the standard ising model ) .",
    "we now consider a potts model on a hierarchical necklace lattice , with @xmath23 bonds and @xmath24 branches , and assume that the couplings can take just two values , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , associated with a sequence of letters produced by the period - doubling substitution . in fig . 1 , we indicate some stages of this construction ( for @xmath23 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that the period - doubling sequence is perfectly suitable for a hierarchical lattice with @xmath23 bonds .",
    "also , note that the choice of the same interactions along the branches turns out to mimic an aperiodic layered structure in the corresponding bravais lattice .",
    "now we decimate the internal degrees of freedom of the necklace structure and write exact recursion relations for the reduced coupling parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 .    in parameter space , besides the trivial fixed points , associated with zero and infinite temperature , there is always a non - trivial symmetric fixed point , associated with the critical behavior of the underlying uniform model ( see the sketch in fig .",
    "the linearization of the recursion relations about the symmetric fixed point @xmath32 leads to the matrix form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a structure factor and @xmath35 is the transpose of the substitution matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues of this linear form are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 it is easy to show that @xmath38 .",
    "note that we can write @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the fractal dimension of the lattice and @xmath42 is the specific heat critical exponent of the underlying uniform model . also , it is easy to show that @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , for @xmath46 . in this last case , for @xmath46 ,",
    "the symmetric fixed point becomes fully unstable , and the geometric fluctuations are relevant ( see the sketch in fig .",
    "for @xmath47 , both for necklace and diamond structures , we have @xmath48 , which also corresponds to the critical number of states for the relevance of disorder in a ferromagnetic potts model on a fully disordered diamond lattice @xcite .    for necklace and diamond lattices with @xmath49 bonds and @xmath24 branches , and a suitable two - letter substitution sequence with period @xmath50 , we can always write @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fractal dimension of the lattice , @xmath53 is the specific heat critical exponent of the underlying uniform model , and @xmath54 where the wandering exponent @xmath55 comes from eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "we then have @xmath56 that leads to an exact version of luck s criterion@xcite for the relevance of geometric fluctuations , @xmath57 for the @xmath0-state potts model on both diamond and necklace lattices with @xmath58 bonds and @xmath59 branches , this inequality is equivalent to @xmath60 , as we have pointed in the last paragraph . in this special case , it also corresponds to @xmath61 , which is in agreement with the usual form of harris criterion for the relevance of disorder@xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that , according to the usual expectations , given @xmath0 , @xmath49 and @xmath24 , the eigenvalues @xmath62 and @xmath63 assume the same values for both diamond and necklace structures .",
    "we now turn to the investigation of the critical behavior when the symmetric fixed point is fully unstable .",
    "numerically , we can see that , instead of a hypothetical aperiodic fixed point , there appears a two - cycle , with a saddle - point character , in parameter space .",
    "we then invoke scaling arguments to write @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the reduced free energy per bond , @xmath66 is a regular function , and @xmath67 is a second iterate of the recursion relations . note that the factor @xmath68 has to be included because we need two iterates to go back to the vicinity of the initial point in parameter space .",
    "this equation leads to the asymptotic solution@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath32 is one of the points of the two - cycle , @xmath70 is the largest eigenvalue of the linearization of the second iterate of the recursion relations about any one of the points of the cycle , @xmath71 is an arbitrary function of period @xmath72 , and the specific heat critical exponent is given by @xmath73    let us show some calculations for the @xmath0-state potts model on a necklace lattice , with @xmath23 bonds , @xmath24 branches , and a distribution of exchange interactions according to the period - doubling two - letter sequence : ( i ) for @xmath74 and @xmath59 , the two - cycle is located at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with eigenvalues of the second iterate given by @xmath77and @xmath78 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , we have @xmath79 , to be compared with the positive value @xmath80 , for the uniform system ; ( ii ) for @xmath81 and @xmath59 , the two - cycle is located at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with eigenvalues of the second iterate given by @xmath84and @xmath85 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , we have @xmath86 , to be compared with @xmath87 , for the corresponding uniform system . for other values of @xmath24",
    ", we find qualitatively similar results .",
    "the specific heat exponent is definitely depressed as compared to the values for the underlying uniform system . also , given @xmath0 , @xmath49 , and @xmath24 , the exponents assume the same values for diamond and necklace structures .    to check the validity of the scaling arguments , and the role of the two - cycle as the responsible for the new critical behavior , we have performed direct numerical analyses of the singularity of the thermodynamic free - energy . for the @xmath0-state potts model on the @xmath23 necklace hierarchical lattice , and with the period - doubling rule , we can write the free energy per bond as a series expansion , @xmath88 \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath89 \\right\\ } .   \\label{eq19}\\ ] ]",
    "all of our numerical checks fully confirm the scaling results .",
    "for example , for @xmath59 and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 , a numerical analysis of the specific heat divergence at the critical temperature leads to @xmath92 , to be compared with the scaling prediction from the two - cycle , @xmath93 ( which is definitely different from the value for the uniform system , @xmath94 ) . within",
    "the error estimates , we always obtain the same numerical results for all values of the ratio @xmath95 . again , given @xmath0 , @xmath49 , and @xmath24 , and for all values of the ratio @xmath95 , the exponents assume the same values for diamond and necklace structures . from the numerical calculations , and particularly for bigger values of @xmath0 , we have been able to detect a log - periodic oscillatory behavior of the thermodynamic functions .",
    "the period of oscillation is compatible with eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) , which has also been confirmed in the independent calculations of andrade@xcite .",
    "along the lines of a paper by mukherji and bhattacharjee@xcite , we now consider a model of two interacting directed polymers on a diamond lattice ( see fig .",
    "the polymers start at one end of the lattice and meet at the other end .",
    "there is an attractive interaction if a bond of the lattice is shared by two polymers .",
    "consider a diamond lattice ( @xmath23 bonds and @xmath24 branches ) , with a layered distribution of interactions , according to the two - letter period - doubling sequence given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to write the recursion relations @xmath96 and @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath99 is the interaction energy at bonds of types @xmath2 and @xmath6 , respectively . for @xmath100",
    ", we recover the recursion relation for the uniform model , @xmath101 besides the trivial fixed points , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , associated with zero and infinite temperatures , there is a nontrivial fixed point , @xmath104 , which becomes physically acceptable , and is associated with a binding - unbinding transition , for @xmath105 ( there is no phase transition on the simple diamond lattice with @xmath59 branches ) .",
    "the recursion relations ( [ eq3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq3.2 ] ) are so simple , that it easy to see that , for @xmath105 , there is no physically acceptable nontrivial fixed points except the symmetric fixed point @xmath106  the linearization of the recursion relations in the neighborhood of this symmetric fixed point leads to matrix form @xmath107 with eigenvalues @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath105 , we have @xmath110 and @xmath43 , which shows that the geometric fluctuations are completely irrelevant in this case .",
    "we now turn to a more interesting case .",
    "consider a diamond lattice with @xmath111 bonds and @xmath24 branches ( in fig .",
    "3 , we sketch a diamond lattice with @xmath111 bonds and @xmath59 branches ) .",
    "suppose that the ( layered ) interactions are chosen according to the period-@xmath112 two - letter sequence , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the substitution matrix is characterized by the eigenvalues @xmath115 and @xmath116 , with the wandering exponent @xmath117 .",
    "the new recursion relations are given by @xmath118 and @xmath119 there is just a single nontrivial fixed point , for @xmath120 , at a symmetric location , @xmath121 the linearization in the neighborhood of this fixed point leads to the matrix form @xmath122 with the eigenvalues @xmath123 ,   \\label{eq3.9}\\ ] ] and @xmath124 .   \\label{eq3.10}\\ ] ] for @xmath125 , it is easy to show that @xmath38 , and @xmath126 . as in the case of the simple diamond lattice with @xmath127 bonds , geometric fluctuations are irrelevant and the critical behavior is identical to the uniform case .",
    "however , for @xmath128 , we have @xmath45 , and the symmetric fixed point becomes fully unstable .",
    "for example , for @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 , with eigenvalues @xmath131 and @xmath132 . for @xmath133 , however , we have @xmath134 , with eigenvalues @xmath135 and @xmath136 . as in the case of the potts model , there is then a cycle - two , of hyperbolic character , in parameter space .",
    "it is easy to locate this cycle at @xmath137 and @xmath138 , with eigenvalues of the second iterate given by @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "in conclusion , we have taken advantage of suitable diamond and necklace hierarchical lattices , and used a distribution of ( layered ) interactions according to a class of two - letter substitution rules , to perform an exact analysis of the effects of geometric fluctuations on the critical behavior of ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts models .",
    "we derived an exact expression for an analog of luck s criterion on a hierarchical lattice .",
    "also , due to the simplicity of the formulation , we have been able to show that the novel critical behavior under the influence of relevant geometric fluctuations is governed by a two - cycle attractor in parameter space .",
    "this new universality class can be described by scaling arguments , that are fully supported by direct thermodynamic calculations for the singularity of the free energy ( as usual , critical exponents do not depend on details of the systems , as the relative strength of the interactions ) .",
    "it is not difficult to extend these calculations for an ising model in the presence of direct and staggered fields@xcite , to analyze the effects of aperiodicity on the tricritical behavior in a mixed - spin ising system@xcite , and to consider some noncommutative sequences@xcite    we have also reported some results for the critical behavior of a model of two directed polymers on a diamond lattice with a ( layered ) distribution of aperiodic interactions ( according to suitable two - letter substitution rules ) .",
