    "it has been suggested that due to the fermi surface nesting a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) instability around @xmath12  point is essential.@xcite an ferroelectric - like soft phonon mode have also been proposed.@xcite basically all the density - functional linear response calculations give a large electron - phonon coupling constant ( @xmath13 ) , and suggest lao@xmath5f@xmath8bis@xmath1 as a strong electron - phonon coupled conventional superconductor.@xcite    in contrast to the band structure calculation , there are also works emphasizing the importance of electron - electron interaction and the possibility of unconventional superconductivity.dagoto-rpa,spinexc,qh-wang,hong-yao,jp-hu starting from the two - orbital model , the spin / charge fluctuation mediated pairing interactions had been studied by using random - phase approximation,@xcite and an extend _ s_-wave or _",

    "very recently , a new superconductor lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 had been discovered.@xcite lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 has similar structure of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1 yet with a lower t@xmath17(@xmath182.6 k).@xcite in order to shed light on the superconducting nature of this family , it is essential to investigate lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 . here we report our theoretical studies of the electronic structure and lattice dynamic properties for lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 .",
    "our first - principles calculation shows that the band structure of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 is quite similar as that of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1 , there is also a strong fermi surface nesting at @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath12 point ) , which leads to imaginary harmonic phonons at this @xmath20 point associated with in - plane displacements of se atoms .",
    "although the @xmath21  supercell frozen phonon calculations confirm a double well related to the soft - mode located at @xmath12 point , our effective model reveals that the double well is too shallow , consequently the cdw structural phase transition indeed will not happen .",
    "replacing s by se will reduce the deybe frequency @xmath22  as well as the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath23 , which explains the decrease of @xmath6 .",
    "our electronic structure calculations are performed based on the quantum espresso package ( qe)@xcite and ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite and the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite the basis set cutoff for the wave functions was 60 ry while 600 ry cutoff was used for the charge density . a dense 18@xmath24 18@xmath24",

    "la , se and bi locate at 2__c _ _ position , while o / f take the 2__a _ _ site .",
    "being embedded into lao plane , it had been found that the substitution o  by f has only small effect on the bis@xmath1 layer in lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1@xcite , and the main influence of f  substitution is a carrier doping@xcite .",

    "we show the calculated phonon spectrum along major high symmetry lines of the ibz in fig.3 .",
    "same as lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath39@xcite the phonon modes have only a little dispersion along @xmath40-z direction , which again indicates the smallness of the interlayer coupling .",
    "the phonon dispersions are extend up to 350 @xmath41 , which is smaller than that of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1wan , yildirim .",
    "there are basically two panels in the phonon spectrum .",
    "the top six branches above 180 cm@xmath29 are almost completely contributed by o and f , while the bi - se vibration dominate in the low frequency region .",
    "comparing with lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath43@xcite , lao@xmath9f@xmath0bise@xmath1 has more branches locate at low frequency region . analyzing",
    "the evolution of the phonon eigenvectors in the ibz reveals that there is clear separation between the _ xy _ and _ z _ polarized vibrations , and the phonon modes with large dispersion mainly comes from the bi - se1 in - plane vibration .",

    "we associate it with the strong fermi surface nesting .",
    "the number of soft modes in lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1  is two , while lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath44  has four unstable modes around @xmath12 point@xcite . from the analysis of the calculated polarization vectors",
    ",  we find that these two unstable modes are mainly contributed by the se1 in - plane vibrations .",
    "we then perform a frozen phonon calculation by using a @xmath45 supercell with respect to its original unit cell to adapt the lattice distortions due to the possible cdw instability associated with the soft phonon mode located at @xmath12 point .",
    "the atomic motions in the frozen phonon calculation is chosen according to the eigenvectors of the unstable phonon modes at the @xmath12 point , which basically is se1 in - plane displacement .",
    "the results of these calculations reveal essentially anharmonic interatomic potentials , and a shallow double well potential ( @xmath46 per unit cell ) where the se1 atoms shift about 0.03   away from the original high symmetry position as show in fig.4 . the depth of the double well is less than half of that in lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath26@xcite for lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1  it had been found that the displacements of s atom are dynamic.@xcite to check",
    "if the quantum zero - point motions also prevent the structural distortion of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 , we therefore extend the equilibrium position analysis by solving numerically schrdinger s equation for the anharmonic potential well found from frozen - phonon calculations , as shown in the red line of fig .",
    "indeed , our numerical atomic ground - state wave function is centered at the high symmetry position , as demonstrated by the probability curve shown in black dot line of fig .",
    "it is therefore clear that the se1 displacement is dynamic , and the unstable phonon modes at @xmath12 point are not related to a statically distorted structure of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 .",
    "experimentally the resistivity changes smoothly from 300 k to about 3 k , and there is not abnormal behavior due to the gap opening associated with cdw phase transition@xcite .",
    "this experimental observation is consistent with our above model calculation .",
    "finally , we check the linewidth @xmath47 of all stable phonons to see the contribution from different modes .",
    "calculation shows that the o / f modes have negligible contribution to electron - phonon coupling . with strong hybridization ,",
    "the coupling , however , is relatively strong for the bise based modes . counting the contribution only from the stable modes results in a coupling constant ( @xmath48 ) calculated using 4@xmath244@xmath242  q - mesh .    to find the contribution from the anharmonic modes , we follow the expression introduced by hui and allen which generalizes zero - temperature electron - phonon coupling to the anharmonic case .",
    "@xcite we make an essential approximation by assuming that the unstable mode is not coupled to the other modes .",
    "the phonon - phonon interactions and finite - temperature effects are also neglected in this treatment .",
    "basically we need all phonon excited states.@xcite fortunately , it had been found the convergency in the sum over the virtual phonon states is fast.hui,meregalli by taking the harmonic dipole matrix elements , and interpreting the first excitation energy from solving the schrdinger s equation for the anharmonic atomic  potential well as the phonon energy , hui we estimate the electron - phonon coupling for the two anharmonic modes at the @xmath12 point .",
    "our numerical @xmath49  value from this two modes is about 0.04 .",
    "adding this value with the contribution from all stable modes gives us a total coupling constant of 0.51 , which is about half of that of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath26@xcite the estimated deybe temperature ( @xmath50 ) is also smaller than that of lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath51@xcite with these values and taking the coulomb parameter @xmath52 , mcmillan formula yields values of @xmath53 in reasonable agreement with the experiment.@xcite",
    "we have studied the electronic structure , lattice dynamics and electron ",
    "phonon interaction of the newly found superconductor lao@xmath0f@xmath9bise@xmath1 using density functional theory and linear response approach .",
    "same as in the case of its cousin lao@xmath0f@xmath0bis@xmath1 , a strong fermi surface nesting is also found at ( @xmath2,@xmath2,0 ) , which results in phonon softening , and we find that the quantum fluctuation prevents the appearance of static long - range order .",
    "considering both harmonic and anharmonic contributions to electron - phonon coupling , we obtain a coupling constant @xmath54 , which is capable of producing the experimental @xmath6  value and suggesting lao@xmath0f@xmath0bise@xmath1 as a electron  phonon superconductor .",
