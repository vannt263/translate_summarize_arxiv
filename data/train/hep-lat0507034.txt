    "it is widely accepted that the continuum limit of asymptotically free lattice gauge theories at zero temperature is obtained in the limit of arbitrarily small coupling . in practice , however , the relevant information about the continuum is obtained from a crossover region where both weak and strong coupling expansions break down , but where one can observe the onset of asymptotic scaling . in this region , observables such as the average of the elementary plaquette are sensitive to the contributions of large field configurations .",

    "<S> we revisit the question of the convergence of lattice perturbation theory for a pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions . using a series for the average plaquette up to order 10 in the weak coupling parameter @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the analysis of the extrapolated ratio and the extrapolated slope suggests the possibility of a non - analytical power behavior of the form @xmath2 , in agreement with another analysis based on the same asumption . </S>",
    "<S> this would imply that the third derivative of the free energy density diverges near @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the peak in the third derivative of the free energy present on @xmath4 lattices disappears if the size of the lattice is increased isotropically up to a @xmath5 lattice . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> on @xmath6 lattices , a jump in the third derivative persists when @xmath7 increases , and follows closely the known values of @xmath8 for the first order finite temperature transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the apparent contradiction at zero temperature can be resolved by moving the singularity in the complex @xmath9 plane . if the imaginary part of the location of the singularity @xmath10 is within the range @xmath11 , it is possible to limit the second derivative of @xmath12 within an acceptable range without affecting drastically the behavior of the perturbative coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possibility of checking the existence of these complex singularities by using the strong coupling expansion or calculating the zeroes of the partition function . </S>"
