    "generating neutrino masses poses somewhat different problems from those for charged fermions .",

    "within such a context , it will be sufficient for three generations of left - handed neutrinos and an additional right - handed neutrino field @xmath12 to illustrate the kinds of bounds on neutrino masses and mixings that can be extracted from existing data .",

    "the most general mass matrix for @xmath219-generations of left - handed and @xmath220 generations of right - handed neutrinos takes the form : @xmath221 we restrict our attention to the case @xmath222 , and assume that there is only an isodoublet higgs field so that majorana masses for left - handed neutrinos are zero .",
    "the quantities @xmath223 are dirac masses , and are given by the product of the yukawa coupling constants and the vacuum expectation value of the isodoublet higgs field .",

    "the yukawa couplings define for us two vectors in three dimensional space . by the above argument",

    "in addition , when @xmath242 , the remaining light neutrino will also become massless . now , the mixing , which is still given as @xmath240 , can not be rewritten as the ratio of light to heavy neutrino masses .",
