    "* - see also @xcite  @xcite ) , the multiple star system qz  car ( hd 93206 ) is the brightest object in the collinder 228 star cluster , in the older southern part of the nebula . via independent observations ,",
    "the presence of two systems of periodically variable lines in the spectrum led @xcite and @xcite to conclude that there were four stars present , where the period of the stronger line variability was due to the @xmath7day binary ( hereafter system a ) and the period of the weaker lines corresponding to the @xmath8day period eclipsing binary ( hereafter system b ) . despite this great success two of the components of the system remain undetected .",
    "the mass functions derived for the separate binary systems suggest that the eclipsing binary component with un - detected lines is more massive than its binary companion , whereas in the longer period , non - eclipsing binary the unseen companion is a few times smaller than the primary component and therefore most likely has unobservable lines .",
    "a schematic of qz  car is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] and system and stellar parameters are noted in tables  [ tab : system_parameters ] and [ tab : stellar_parameters ] , respectively .",
    "based on the roche - lobe filling factors give roche - lobe filling factors for stars b1 and b2 of @xmath9and 0.4 , respectively .",
    "] , @xcite suggested that the stars in system b have undergone some mass exchange .",
    "@xcite also noted that there is evidence of substantial mass - loss from the primary star in system b due to a systematic difference in velocity between he i and si iv , which from an evolutionary point of view makes it the most interesting star in this system .",
    "little is known about the mutual orbit of systems a and b. the results of @xcite and @xcite were in agreement that the orbital period of the super - binary must be @xmath10yrs . yet",
    "this was based on the assumption that at the time of their observations the system was at quadrature , or apastron in an eccentric orbit .",
    "the speckle observations of @xcite were unsuccessful in spatially resolving the components of hd 93206 , as were the more sensitive fgs1r observations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the non - resolution of the system places an upper limit of @xmath11au on the projected separation of the two binary systems .",
    "in this paper we report on the recent detection of x - ray emission from qz  car . for single massive stars it is widely accepted that ( soft )",
    "x - ray emission is generated by embedded wind shocks ( ewss ) which are produced by the inherent instability of the line - driving mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "early x - ray observations of massive stars in binary systems revealed them to be over - luminous compared to the expected cumulative luminosity of the separate stars @xcite .",
    "the additional luminosity in this case is the result of wind - wind collision shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for qz",
    "car , further additional x - ray emission may be contributed by the mutual wind - wind collision between the two binary systems ( mwc ) .",
    "the observed flux may therefore be a complex cocktail of x - ray emission from different sources , and disentangling its origin(s ) is not straightforward .",
    "we note that the central multiple star system is surrounded by a subcluster of faint x - ray emitting pre - main sequence stars , for which we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed analysis .",
    "the x - ray observations of qz  car were obtained with the chandra x - ray observatory ( hereafter _ chandra _ ) as part of the chandra carina complex project ( cccp)@xcite . the x - ray spectra can be reasonably well fitted by three - temperature plasma models with a hot component at @xmath12kev .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the observed fluxes appear to be over - luminous in comparison to the total x - ray emission expected from the single stars , may be indicating the presence of shock heated plasma from wind - wind collisions .",
    "however , attempts to match the best - fit parameters from the spectral fits to the periods of either system a or b do not reveal any strong correlation . to aid in the interpretation of the observations",
    "a semi - analytical model is constructed which indicates that although normal wind - wind collision shocks are not expected , unless the wind of the o8  iii star is suppressed the model overpredicts the observed x - ray emission by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "the suppressant in this case could be mass transfer from the o8  iii star @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the dominant contributions to the observed x - ray flux are the single stars and the mwc .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows : in   [ sec : observations ] we present the observations ,   [ sec : results ] describes the results from spectral fitting ,   [ sec : interp ] details a semi - analytical model of qz  car .",
    "the results from this work are discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] , and we close with a summary of our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "+    .system parameters for qz car .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     with a range of pre - shock velocities , the x - ray spectrum for qz car may well be dominated by emission from different shocked plasma components at different energies . approximating the mean @xmath14 to be roughly half of the maximum value ( to account for shock obliquity downstream from the apex of the wcr ) we see that the predicted values for component a1-o ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - wind_plots]d ) are slightly lower than those derived for the hot plasma component from the spectral fits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit5_plots ] and table  [ tab : fit5_values ] ) which has a mean temperature of 2.00  kev .",
    "in contrast , the mean temperatures from the mwc , where @xmath14 s are @xmath15 and 3.1  kev for system a and b respectively , are higher than the observationally determined value .",
    "we note that all the values are higher than our adopted mean plasma temperature for ewss of @xmath16kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the intrinsic x - ray flux from the individual shocked winds is shown in fig .  [ fig : wind - wind_plots]e .",
    "component b1-o has the highest intrinsic x - ray luminosity , and so system b will dominate the x - ray emission if one assumes that the wcr has not been disrupted by mass transfer ( for an alternative scenario see   [ subsec : comparison2obs ] ) .",
    "component a1-o is the _",
    "emitter ( noting that component a1-o is bright for a brief period around periastron which is not sampled by our observations - see the @xmath17 s in table  [ tab : obsinfo ] ) , followed by the ewss ( @xmath18erg  s@xmath6  @xmath4 ) , both of which are fainter than the contribution from the mwc ( table  [ tab : mutual_wwc ] ) .",
    "however , before making a detailed comparison with the best - fit values from the spectral fits we can improve our predictions by considering the energy dependence of the intrinsic and attenuated flux .",
    "c +   +   +   +      the range of preshock velocities evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - wind_plots]a will cause the spectra from the different components to have different characteristic energies .",
    "we can examine the implications of this energy dependence by firstly calculating an intrinsic spectrum at the mean post - shock gas temperature using the mekal plasma code @xcite , where solar abundances are assumed @xcite .",
    "each intrinsic spectrum is then scaled so that the integrated 0.5 - 8  kev fluxes are equal to the orbital phase dependent values , which for components a1-o and b1-o are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wind - wind_plots]e . the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_specs ] shows the intrinsic spectra calculated for components a1-o , b1-o , the ewss , and the mwc for obs i d 6402 ( see table  [ tab : obsinfo ] for the respective orbital phases of systems a and b ) .",
    "the ewss clearly contribute the softest spectrum . for the wind - wind collision shocks ,",
    "the lower preshock velocity for component b1-o relative to the mwc and component a1-o also results in a slightly softer spectrum .",
    "interestingly , although not the brightest emitter , the mwc has the hardest spectrum .    to estimate the impact of circumstellar absorption , a characteristic column density for the binary systems",
    "can be calculated using eq(11 ) from @xcite ,    @xmath19    the expression for @xmath20 is for a binary system at quadrature where the winds are assumed to be at their terminal velocities ( @xmath21 s are used to calculate @xmath22 in this case ) .",
    "when the stars are at quadrature all lines of sight to the emitting region will pass through the more powerful wind , which is assumed to be the dominant absorber .",
    "the orbital phase dependent characteristic column densities for systems a and b are @xmath23@xmath4 and @xmath24@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "note that in using eq  [ eqn : nh ] we are essentially assuming the system is always at quadrature . to calculate the optical depth",
    ", we then multiply the total column density ( = @xmath25 ) by the opacity for gas at @xmath26k calculated using version @xmath27 of cloudy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , where solar abundances are assumed @xcite .",
    "it is important to highlight that no circumstellar absorption is added for the ewss as the @xmath28 relation is for sources which have been corrected only for ism absorption .",
    "coincidently , the circumstellar absorption to the wcr between systems a and b is very small , so that this component essentially suffers only ism absorption .",
    "the resulting attenuated spectra are displayed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_specs ] . with the exception of the ews emission ,",
    "there is a consistent trend of a turnover energy of @xmath29kev .",
    "furthermore , the biggest victims of energy dependent absorption are components a1-o and b1-o , which can be seen from a comparison of the intrinsic and attenuated spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_specs ] .",
    "c +   +   +   +   +    c +   +    c +   +    c      the model predictions and observations are in good agreement for a number of features . for instance , the x - ray emission from wind collision shocks can explain the hot plasma component derived from the spectral fits . despite this ,",
    "if all of the emitters in the system are active the total attenuated flux predicted by the model is @xmath30times higher than the fluxes obtained from the spectral fits , with the dominant contribution to the model flux coming from the post - shock gas of component b1-o ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_plots ] ) .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the assumption of a normal wind for component b1-o is justified as @xcite suggested that this system is semi - detached .",
    "numerical models of short period , massive star binary systems by @xcite have shown that even a relatively small mass transfer rate ( @xmath31 ) is unimpeded by the winds of the stars and can therefore disrupt the apex of the wind - wind collision region . to gain a better agreement between the model and observations it would seem necessary for some mechanism to kill - off the x - ray emission from system b ; mass transfer is a viable option .",
    "recalling that a comparison of the spectra from qz  car and those of single and binary stars in carina showed that on the basis of the spectral shape and the derived plasma temperatures we can not directly infer the presence of wind - wind collision shocks , one may be inclined to neglect the mwc emission also . yet , if we only consider the x - ray emission from the individual stars ( hereafter scenario  1 ) there is a deficit between model and observation of a factor of @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_scenarios ] ) ) lead to an integrated @xmath33 for qz  car which is a factor of @xmath34lower than determined by @xcite .",
    "although increasing @xmath35 by this factor will cause a corresponding increase in @xmath36 , the shortfall between scenario  1 and the observed fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : lx_scenarios ] would not be remedied . ] . including the mwc emission ( hereafter scenario  2 ) remedies the shortfall , and a good agreement",
    "is attained when stellar mass - loss rates are reduced by a factor of 1.1 . noting that massive star winds are inhomogeneous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) , and that results from detailed observational studies suggest that previous mass - loss rate estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require scaling down by factors of 2 - 5 @xcite , this seems to be a reasonably modest alteration .",
    "notwithstanding the improved agreement between the model and observed fluxes , the average column derived from the spectral fits ( @xmath37@xmath4 ) is significantly higher than the value calculated for the mwc .",
    "this could be indicating two things .",
    "the first is that in using eq  [ eqn : nh ] we may be underestimating the column density to the shocked gas between systems a and b , or that a more detailed description of the x - ray emission and absorption to the individual stars is warranted .",
    "bearing in mind that the x - ray flux from the mwc @xmath38 ( since the shocked gas is adiabatic ) , we raise the question of whether a lower limit can be placed on @xmath39 if we make a slightly larger ( but still reasonable ) reduction in mass - loss rates ?",
    "proceeding with this approach the observed flux level can be approximately matched if we reduce @xmath40 s by a factor of 3 and decrease @xmath39 to @xmath41 cm , i.e. a factor of 10 smaller than the upper limit given by @xcite .",
    "this alternation in fact causes a negligible change to the column density calculated for the mwc .",
    "however , due to the uncertainty in the orbital eccentricity of system ab this is a somewhat tentative lower limit .",
    "the presence of a hot plasma component with @xmath42kev in the spectral fits could be providing evidence for wind - wind collision shocks in qz  car .",
    "however , to prevent our model predictions from considerably overestimating the observed flux we must suppress the prominent x - ray emission from system b. this is an interesting result as mass transfer in system b could provide an effective mechanism to disrupt the wind - wind collision region , and therefore our results support the previous suggestion by @xcite of mass transfer in system b ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "reassuringly , this result is unaffected by our adopted distance to qz  car - we adopt a distance of 2.3 kpc which differs from that of @xcite who quote a value of 2.8 kpc .",
    "the net effect of using this slightly larger distance would be a reduction in the calculated fluxes by a factor of @xmath43 , which would not affect our qualitative conclusions .",
    "we must note , however , that although additional emission from the mwc is required in our model , a more detailed description of the emission from the single star than adopted in this work may render this unnecessary .",
    "furthermore , the ism column density provides the dominant absorption to the mwc and the individual stars , therefore , a small increase / decrease in the ism column could have implications for our model results .",
    "this semi - analytical model has nevertheless provided a great deal of insight .",
    "further progress will require detailed hydrodynamical modelling which should consider the following factors :    * the stellar separations in the binary systems are relatively small and therefore the interaction between the stellar radiation fields may affect the wind acceleration ( e.g. inhibition or braking , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which would alter the resulting x - ray flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* post - shock gas is in reality multi - temperature and more accurate comparisons against the observed spectra will require this to be taken into account .",
    "* the nature of system  b must be properly considered .",
    "* we account for the radiative behaviour of the shocked gas through the @xmath44 scaling in eq .",
    "[ eqn : lx ] .",
    "however , the effect of radiative cooling on the dynamics and the x - ray emission is likely to be more complicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contrasting views exist as to the x - ray generation mechanism for single o type stars .",
    "for instance , recent high resolution analysis of o type stars has given evidence for a decrease in x - ray temperature in the stellar wind as one tends to larger radii @xcite .",
    "this poses questions for the classic picture of x - ray generation by instability driven shocks , whereby higher x - ray temperatures are attained at larger radii at which point the flow has been accelerated somewhat @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be appropriate to assess these models in future work , in particular examining the spatial and energy dependence of the x - ray emission and absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have presented a series of nine observations of the multiple star system qz  car obtained with _",
    "chandra _ over a period of roughly 2 years .",
    "the spectral fits are characterised by cool , moderate , and hot temperature plasma components at @xmath2 and 2 kev , respectively , a circumstellar absorption of @xmath45@xmath4 , and an average flux of @xmath5erg  s@xmath6  @xmath4 .",
    "there appears to be no clear correlation between the fluxes and the orbits of the constituent binaries .",
    "the most compelling evidence for any correlation is between the high temperature thermal plasma component and the orbit of the o9.7  i + b2  v binary ( system a ) , although due to limited statistics the high temperature plasma component is poorly constrained .",
    "curiously , there is also a deficit between the x - ray flux expected from the single stars and that derived from the spectral fits .    a semi - analytical model of qz",
    "car was constructed .",
    "a stable momentum balance is not attained between the winds in either the o9.7  i + b2  v binary ( system a ) or the o8  iii + o9  v binary ( system b ) , and despite possessing the strongest stellar wind in qz  car the o9.7  i star is a weak emitter ( in terms of wind - wind collision emission ) due to the relatively small fraction of its wind being shocked .",
    "the higher fraction of the primary star s wind being shocked in the o8  iii + o9  v binary ( system b ) makes it the dominant emitter , although the magnitude of its x - ray emission exceeds the flux level derived from the spectral fits by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "the necessity of a disrupted wind - wind collision region in the o8  iii + o9  v binary to bring the model results and observations into better agreement gives some compelling evidence in support of @xcite s suggestion of mass transfer .",
    "we conclude that the magnitude and lack of variability in the fluxes derived from the spectral fits can be well matched by a combination of x - ray emission from the individual stars and the mutual wind - wind collision between the two binary systems , albeit with stellar wind mass - loss rates reduced in - line with the current consensus for inhomogeneous winds .",
    "the observed column density is , however , not well matched by the model .",
    "this may be indicating that a more complex prescription for the emission from the individual stars is required , or also that the column density calculation is not completely appropriate for the mutual wind - wind collision between the two binary systems .",
    "our analysis places a somewhat tentative lower limit on the separation of the two binary systems of @xmath46au .",
    "future analysis would benefit from further observations .",
    "a follow - up x - ray observation with significant enough exposure time to allow a satisfactory fit with a three temperature plasma model with discrete absorption components could constrain the column density to the hot plasma . at radio wavelengths it may in fact be possible to resolve the separate emission peaks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the sensitivity of current instruments would require a long observation to attain sufficient statistics , which considering the timescale of the binary orbits may cause detailed structure to become smeared @xcite . with our results providing support for mass transfer in the o8  iii + o9  v binary , multi - wavelength observations may reveal a far more complicated picture for qz  car ( e.g. @xmath47lyrae ; * ? ? ?",
