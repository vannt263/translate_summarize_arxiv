    "much theoretical and experimental work has addressed the effect of a superconductor ( s ) in proximity to a normal metal ( n ) on the transport properties during the last years , see ref .   and references therein for a review .",
    "most experimental results can be explained in the framework of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity accounting for a `` long range '' proximity effect with a coherence length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the diffusion coefficient of the normal metal and @xmath2 is the temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "applications of the quasi - classical theory to transport in heterostructures containing ferromagnets ( f ) are still scarce .",
    "in contrast to normal metals the presence of a strong exchange field in the ferromagnet leads to a strong difference in the energy dispersions for the two spin bands .",
    "however , long - range coherence in normal metals requires spin degenerate bands close to the fermi energy , since singlet superconductivity couples quasiparticles of different spins by andreev reflection .",
    "the consequence of the exchange field energy @xmath3 is a strong decoherence of quasiparticles belonging to the different spin bands .",
    "typically the superconducting energy scale @xmath4 is smaller than @xmath3 by several orders of magnitude for ( al , nb ) _ vs. _",
    "( fe , ni , and co ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the proximity effect in ferromagnetic metals is negligible and a ferromagnet in contact to a superconductor may be considered as an _",
    "incoherent _ metal coupled to the superconductor . in this case",
    "all changes induced by the contact to a superconductor depend on the properties of the interface itself .",
    "this is accomplished by the effect of spin accumulation@xcite , which requires no phase coherence in the ferromagnet and can therefore have a much longer range than the proximity effect .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the mutual influence of resistance changes by spin accumulation and interface properties .",
    "recently heterostructures of ferromagnets and superconductors have been experimentally realized and investigated.@xcite several unusual phenomena have been unveiled .",
    "the experimental results in point contact geometries@xcite can be explained by the reduced , bias - dependent transparency of the interface due to spin - dependent band mismatch between the normal metal and the ferromagnet.@xcite the experimental results in diffusive nanostructured samples@xcite are more intriguing",
    ". the measured conductance changes on the ferromagnetic side can be positive and negative at the superconducting transition with amplitudes much larger than anticipated .",
    "the sign and the amplitude of the changes appear to depend strongly on the ferromagnetic - superconductor interface transparency .",
    "it has been conjectured that a strong mutual influence of the superconductors and ferromagnetic conductors and a penetration of the superconducting order parameter into the ferromagnet over distances many times longer than expected from the above estimates might explain the observations.@xcite    some effects of the interplay between spin accumulation and andreev reflection in diffuse systems have been discussed in refs .  .",
    "since the spin - current into a superconductor vanishes at sufficiently low bias and temperature , a non - equilibrium spin - accumulation builds up on the ferromagnetic side in order to conserve the spin - currents .",
    "the spin - accumulation causes an additional boundary resistance which is of the order of the resistance of the ferromagnetic wire of a length of the spin - flip diffusion length .",
    "therefore the resistance of the f - s system should be always larger than that of the f - n system , in contradiction with many of the experimental observations .",
    "a possible reason for this apparent failure is the neglect of changes in the interface resistance in the transition from f - s to f - n .",
    "previous theories took into account only perfectly ballistic interfaces for which the resistance is determined purely by the matching of the adjacent fermi surfaces .",
    "the interface resistance and its modulation are of the order of the sharvin resistance , which is negligible compared to the total one . however , in the sputtered samples with relatively large contact areas@xcite the interface can contribute significantly , especially when differences of resistances below and above the superconducting transition temperatures are considered .",
    "other transport phenomena in ferromagnet - superconductors systems have been studied in ref . .",
    "it has been speculated that the triplet component of the order parameter induced by the fluctuations of the spin - orbit scattering potentials is essential in mesoscopic junctions.@xcite neglecting magnetic impurities and spin - orbit coupling the superconducting order parameter is a spin singlet .",
    "however , magnetic impurities or spin - orbit coupling , induce a fluctuating spin triplet component with zero average .",
    "the triplet component is ` long - range ' coherent in the ferromagnet since it couples electrons and holes with the same spin and the exchange field in the ferromagnet does not play a role .",
    "however , the contribution to the conductivity from the triplet fluctuations is only relevant when the fluctuations are relatively large which is only the case when the conductance is close to the quantum conductance .",
    "the experimental samples@xcite have a much larger conductance , and we do not expect that such mesoscopic fluctuations play an important role .",
    "none of the above - mentioned theories can explain the recent experimental results .",
    "this makes it necessary to study the properties of the contact between the ferromagnet and the normal metal in more detail and to account for a possible spin accumulation and heating effects in the ferromagnet including all possible interfaces between the ferromagnets and the superconductors .",
    "in particular we will go beyond the assumptions of a perfect transparent metallic interface@xcite and discuss its influence on the observed conductance changes below the superconducting transition temperature and for bias voltages less than the superconducting gap .",
    "we will in this work radically disregard the proximity effect . therefore our results only apply to ferromagnets with @xmath5 , which is _",
    "e.g. _ the case for the magnetic transition metals ( fe , co , and ni ) in conjunction with superconducting metals like nb and al .",
    "this assumption is supported by the experimental fact that fs interferometers show no phase - periodic oscillations down to the level of @xmath6 in strong ferromagnets.@xcite in contrast to the calculations presented in this paper , the proximity effect could be important in weak ferromagnets .",
    "below we will show that most of the recent experimental results can be explained in terms of the energy - dependence introduced by interface conductance and the accomplishing change in the spin accumulation .",
    "it is important to note that these changes are small in comparison to the total resistance , which is dominated by the long ferromagnetic wire .",
    "nevertheless they play a dominant role when only the resistance changes are measured .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : section [ sec : kin - eq ] gives a description of the diffusive ferromagnetic wire both in the limit of elastic and inelastic scattering between the electrons .",
    "section [ sec : bc ] treats the boundary condition between the ferromagnet and the superconductor which is crucial to the understanding of the transport properties .",
    "the results for the conductance obtained from the description of the ferromagnetic wire with the boundary conditions are discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally we compare our results with experiments in section [ sec : discussion ] and give our conclusions in section [ sec : concl ] .     and a grounded superconducting reservoir .",
