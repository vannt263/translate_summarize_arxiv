    "<S> the localization length and density of states of carbon nanotubes are evaluated within the tight - binding approximation . by comparison with the corresponding results for the square lattice tubes </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the hexagonal structure affects strongly the behaviors of the density of states and localization lengths of carbon nanotubes .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , there have been extensive interests in the study of carbon nanotubes transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in particular , extremely high or even ballistic conductance was reported in carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this indicates that carbon nanotubes can be synthesized with high purity . </S>",
    "<S> however , as there are always some defects or dislocations inside the tubes or caused by the substrate or attached to the tubes , much attention has been paid to the study of the disorder effect in carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in 1992 , minitmire @xcite predicted that a carbon nanotube can behave as a metal or a semiconductor depending on its chirality . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction was later confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopic measurements . @xcite white argued that due to the @xmath0 rotation symmetry the scattering of electrons is significantly reduced by the doughnut - like wave packet confined along the tube but extended around its circumference in the @xmath1 tubes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , it is believed that semiconducting tubes are more sensitive to long - range disorder than metallic tubes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in this letter we explore the effect of geometrical structure on the scattering of electrons in carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the localization length as well as the density of states with the green s function method . by comparison with the corresponding quantities for the square lattice tubes </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the hexagonal structure can significantly reduce the scattering of electrons by on - site random potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the density of states ( dos ) on the localization lengths of carbon nanotubes is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the anderson model of random potentials for carbon nanotubes @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 means that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are nearest neighbors ; @xmath6 is a random on - site potential . </S>",
    "<S> it takes any value between @xmath7 and @xmath8 with equal probability . without loss of generality , we set @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes can generally be classified by two integers and labeled as @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> two types of carbon nanotubes are of particular interest . </S>",
    "<S> one is the armchair type with @xmath11 , and the other is the zigzag type with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> an undoped armchair nanotube is always a metal , but a zigzag nanotube is a metal only when @xmath13 with @xmath14 an integer . in general , it shows that a carbon nanotube is a metal if @xmath15 is a multiple of @xmath16 or a semiconductor otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , only the armchair or zigzag nanotubes will be considered below .    </S>",
    "<S> a carbon nanotube can be taken as a one dimensional stripe extending along the tube direction . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the stripe depends on the structure of the nanotube . for a @xmath17 zigzag tube , </S>",
    "<S> the width is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if we use @xmath19 to represent the basis state for the @xmath20th slice of the stripe along the tube direction , then the schr@xmath21dinger equation for the single - particle eigenfunction , @xmath22 , can be determined by the following recursion formula , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the interaction matrix between two neighboring slices . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is a diagonal matrix , formed by the random on - site potential @xmath26 in the @xmath20th slice . for square lattices , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 is simply a unit matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however , for carbon nanotubes , it takes a more complicated form . for a zigzag tube </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath24 is a simple periodic function of @xmath20 and the periodicity is 4 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the @xmath27 zigzag nanotube ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , @xmath24 are    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a @xmath30 unit matrix . for other zigzag or armchair tubes , @xmath24 can be similarly defined .    </S>",
    "<S> the localization length @xmath31 is a characteristic length scale for describing the decay of an eigenfunction in space . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the matrix elements of the resolvent @xmath34 between the site states in the first and @xmath20th slices . given a configuration of random potentials , @xmath31 can be evaluated by solving eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) with the green s function approach introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the localization length as a function of energy @xmath35 for two zigzag nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the dos for the corresponding systems without impurities is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> for the semiconducting ( 10,0 ) zigzag nanotube , @xmath31 shows a dip at zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression of @xmath31 is apparently due to the vanishing dos at @xmath36 since there is a finite energy gap for the @xmath37 nanotube at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the ( 9,0 ) zigzag nanotube , the dos is finite and @xmath31 shows a peak at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the localization length behaves very differently in different type of nanotubes .    </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the zero energy peak of @xmath31 is a unique property of metallic carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> as shown later , it does not appear in square lattice tubes . </S>",
    "<S> for the metallic nanotubes , it is known that both the dos and the energy separation between the two dos peaks below and above @xmath36 decrease linearly with increasing tube diameters . however , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 , the @xmath36 peak of @xmath31 is found to increase monotonically with increasing tube diameters . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the peak of @xmath31 is anti - correlated with the dos at @xmath36 for the metallic nanotubes .    in both @xmath38 and @xmath37 nanotubes , </S>",
    "<S> the dos without impurities shows many diverging peaks at band edges . </S>",
    "<S> however , these singularities are smeared out by disorders and @xmath31 only exhibits some small fluctuation at the energies corresponding to these singularities ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the difference of @xmath31 in the semiconducting and metallic nanotubes can be understood from the difference in their dos . in a disorder system , within the relaxation time approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the mean free path @xmath40 is related to the dos by the relation , @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fermi velocity and @xmath43 is the dos at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> in the weak scattering limit , the velocity of carriers decreases rapidly when the fermi level shift to the edge of forbidden band , but the dos tends to diverge because of the presence of van hove singularities . </S>",
    "<S> thus the mean free path is very short . </S>",
    "<S> however , for metallic nanotubes there is a flat band around @xmath36 and the dos is small but non - zero , the corresponding mean free path should be much larger than the semiconducting case . </S>",
    "<S> since the localization length is roughly proportional to the mean free path @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of channels @xcite , it is expected the localization length of metallic nanotubes to be much longer than that of semiconducting one in the middle of the band . in additional , </S>",
    "<S> the dos near the fermi level depend only on the diameter of a metallic nanotube , independent on its chirality . </S>",
    "<S> the localization length of a chiral nanotube behaves similarly as for a zigzag or armchair nanotube with close diameter.@xcite thus the above conclusion can be also applied to a chiral nanotube .    for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we have also evaluated the localization length and the corresponding dos of pure systems for the square lattice nanotubes . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 , the dos in the square lattice tubes diverges at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity scattering will suppress the divergence of dos . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the fermi level , the dos is still very high . since the mean free path is inversely proportional to the dos , @xmath46 and @xmath31 of square lattice nanotube </S>",
    "<S> are expected to be much shorter than that of carbon nanotube as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - ratio ] . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the metallic carbon nanotubes , @xmath31 in a square lattice nanotube shows a dip around @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that @xmath31 is strongly affected by lattice structures and the hexagonal symmetry of carbon nanotubes can enhance the mobility of the state at the middle of the band .    </S>",
    "<S> to further elucidate the difference between carbon and square - lattice nanotubes , we evaluate the ratio between the localization length of metallic carbon nanotubes and that of square nanotubes with close circumference . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 , the difference between the localization lengths in these two systems is more apparent when the circumference of nanotubes or the strength of disorder becomes smaller . the localization length of the ( 2,2 ) armchair nanotube ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) is more than a order of magnitude larger than the square - lattice one when @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees with the result of white and todorov . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it indicates that the mobility of carbon nanotubes is much better than that of square lattice ones , especially for thin tubes .    in summary , we have evaluated the localization length and dos of carbon nanotubes and they are compared with the corresponding quantities for square lattice nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicates that in the same strength of disorders , electrons are more extended in a metallic carbon nanotube than in a nanotube rolled from a square lattice , especially in the limit of small diameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus high conductance is favored by the hexagonal structure of carbon nanotubes . + this work has been supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no @xmath49 . </S>"
