    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al 2000 ) has started producing both photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "it is expected that the sdss will produce a very large and homogeneous database for research on the nature of galaxies .",
    "photometric observations are made with the new five color bands ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) that divide the entire range from the atmospheric ultraviolet cutoff to the sensitivity limit of silicon ccd into five , essentially non - overlapping , passbands ( fukugita et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these passbands are chosen on the basis of their astrophysical merits , but this specific choice makes it difficult to compare or combine the sdss data with those obtained with more conventional photometric systems .    in this paper , we present results from a brief analysis for properties of galaxies using a small set of data for bright galaxies in the new photometric system .",
    "the present results have already been used to construct empirical galaxy models for simulations that have extensively been used to tune the sdss project software ( lupton et al .",
    "unpublished ) and to aid galaxy science ( yasuda et al . 2000 ) .",
    "to study properties of galaxies , it is essential to classify the galaxies into morphological types , since different morphological types exhibit distinctly different astrophysical properties , reflecting the different histories of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "a number of attempts have been proposed for automated classification of morphologies ( e.g. , doi , fukugita , & okamura 1993 ; lahav et al .",
    "1996 ; abraham et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) , but visual classification still serves as the most reliable method when we adopt the hubble classification ( sandage 1961 ) for galaxies with large apparent sizes .",
    "this visual inspection procedure , which is of course very labor - intensive , limits the size of our sample . while we are conducting an attempt to produce a large - scale eye - classified sample , we present here an analysis we have carried out as our initial study .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our considerations on three statistical quantities : color , effective size , and concentration parameter .",
    "galaxy colors are an important quantity that characterizes stellar contents of galaxies .",
    "the colors at zero redshift are also used as a fiducial zero point to study statistical properties of faint galaxies and their evolution .",
    "an important test is to confirm whether the colors obtained with sdss photometry are consistent with those expected from broad band photometry using the conventional passbands , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , and with those calculated from template spectroscopic energy distributions of galaxies .",
    "this is an initial step in establishing a photometric system where the spectrophotometrically synthesized flux matches closely with the broad band flux , which is one of the goals of sdss photometry .",
    "the second statistical quantity is the distribution of effective sizes of galaxies .",
    "the de vaucouleurs profile ( de vaucouleurs 1948 ) is usually characterized by the half light radius @xmath17 and the exponential disk by the scale length @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters set the fundamental length scales of galaxies .",
    "how these quantities scale with magnitude is indispensable information for construction of simulations of galaxies , in particular the study of the detectability of galaxies at faint magnitudes and the performance of star galaxy classification algorithms , both of which depend on the apparent sizes of galaxies .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether the effective size varies across the different color bands , which provides information needed to understand the statistical distribution of stellar populations in galaxies for a global sample .",
    "the third quantity we study is the concentration index of the light distribution of each galaxy .",
    "this parameter is known to correlate with the morphological type ( morgan 1958 ) ; earlier type galaxies have light profiles more concentrated toward the center .",
    "there is some evidence that this parameter can be used for automated morphological classification ( doi et al .",
    "1993 ; abraham et al .",
    "specifically , we study the performance of automated classification schemes when the concentration parameter is used to classify galaxies into early and late types .",
    "we describe briefly the data and the photometric catalog in  2 . in  3 our morphological classification and the resulting catalog are described .",
    "color indices are studied in  4 . in ",
    "5 the distribution of the scale lengths of galaxies is discussed , and in  6 the concentration index is studied .",
    "conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "the sdss ( york et al . 2000 ) is carried out using a wide - field 2.5 m telescope , a large format imaging camera ( gunn et al . 1998 ) , two fiber - fed double spectrographs , and an auxiliary 0.5 m telescope for photometric calibration . the sky is imaged with thirty photometric ccds , arranged in six columns of five rows , each row corresponding to a different passband .",
    "the data are taken in time - delay - and - integrate mode at the sidereal rate along great circles on the sky , yielding a _ strip _ consisting of six very long and narrow _ scanlines _ , each @xmath19 wide .",
    "the effective exposure time is 54.1 sec .",
    "the scanlines of a given strip do not overlap , but observing a second strip offset from the first strip by about @xmath20 gives a filled _ stripe _ @xmath21 wide .",
    "the pixels are @xmath22 square on a side .",
    "the 0.5 m photometric telescope observes standard stars to determine the atmospheric extinction on each night and ties the standard stars to objects observed with the 2.5 m survey telescope .",
    "sdss imaging data taken in five passbands , @xmath23 and @xmath12 ( fukugita et al . 1996 ) , are processed with the photometric pipeline ( hereafter _ photo _ ; lupton et al .",
    "unpublished ) specifically written for sdss imaging data processing .",
    "the galaxies used in this paper are taken from observations of the northern equatorial stripe on 19 march , 1999 ( sdss run 745 ) , supplemented with observations on 20 march , 1999 ( run 752 ) and 21 march , 1999 ( run 756 ) .",
    "these imaging data were taken before the commissioning of the current photometric telescope .",
    "we calibrated the data by observing secondary patches in the survey area using a ( now decommissioned ) 61 cm telescope at the observatory site , and by observing primary standard stars using us naval observatory s 40-inch telescope , with filter and ccd characteristics nominally identical to those at the sdss photometric telescope . since the transformation from the primary standard stars to the objects observed with the sdss 2.5 m telescope has not yet been fully defined , we expect photometric errors of @xmath240.05 mag in each band with respect to the proper sdss photometric system",
    ". thus , in this paper , we will denote our magnitudes as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , to emphasize the preliminary nature of our photometric calibration , rather than the notation @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 that will be used for the final sdss photometric system .",
    "however , we will use the latter notation to refer to the sdss photometric passbands themselves .",
    "the magnitudes we use are based on the ab@xmath30 system ( fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the galaxies we study in this paper are taken from run 745 , which ranges from ra=@xmath31 to @xmath32 covering effectively 127 square degrees in total .",
    "we take all 217 galaxies brighter than @xmath33 mag contained in run 745 for morphological classification by eye ( here @xmath34 stands for the petrosian magnitude in the @xmath9 band as defined below ) .",
    "additionally , we take all 160 galaxies with @xmath35 in the ra range @xmath31 to @xmath36 , and 107 galaxies with @xmath37 in the ra range @xmath31 to @xmath38 .",
    "this makes the size of our morphologically classified sample to be 484 galaxies in total .",
    "our sample is not homogeneous with respect to brightness , but otherwise we do not expect any other selection biases .",
    "those galaxies which fall on the edge of the fields are not taken in our sample .",
    "the @xmath9 band is used in order to facilitate comparison of our morphological classification with the work done in the past , which has been almost exclusively performed using the blue band image .",
    "after we carried out morphological classification using run 745 , an improved photometric data processing was done for runs 752 and 756 , the regions of which overlap with that of run 745 .",
    "therefore , we identified galaxies in our sample with those imaged by runs 752 and 756 and developed a photometric catalog from these two runs of late 1999 .",
    "the most important improvement that concerns us here is in the accuracy of fluxes of deblended objects . ] .",
    "unfortunately , the entire region of run 745 is not covered with runs 752 and 756 , and this leads us to drop 28 galaxies .",
    "hence we work with 456 galaxies in the analysis given in this paper .",
    "details of photometry of galaxies in runs 752 and 756 are discussed in yasuda et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    while many photometric parameters are measured in _",
    ", we are concerned in this paper only with three classes of parameters :    \\(1 ) _ petrosian radius in the five bands : _",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43    the petrosian radius @xmath44 is defined as the parameter that satisfies @xmath45 in practice , this implicit equation for @xmath44 is replaced with @xmath46         \\over { 2\\pi \\int i(r)rdr/(\\pi r_p^2 ) } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the surface brightness profile of the object .",
    "we adopt @xmath48 .",
    "we measure the petrosian radius in each band , but we use only the radius measured in the @xmath10 band to calculate the petrosian flux ( or petrosian magnitude ) for all color bands , so that the aperture for the petrosian flux is common to the five passbands .",
    "\\(2 ) _ petrosian magnitude in the five passbands : _",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53    the petrosian flux is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is set equal to 2 and @xmath44 is the @xmath10 petrosian radius . for further detailed discussion of the petrosian flux ,",
    "see yasuda et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ petrosian half light radius and petrosian @xmath7 light radius : _ @xmath56 , @xmath57    @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined , respectively , so that the fluxes over the aperture with these radii are @xmath60 and @xmath7 of the petrosian flux in the passband @xmath61 , and @xmath12 .",
    "to give an idea about the basic properties of our sample , we show the distribution of @xmath9-band petrosian magnitudes in figure 1 , and those of @xmath41 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 in figure 2 .",
    "magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the dust distribution estimated by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) with the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "when necessary we use @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for the other color bands .",
    "the galaxies in our sample are classified into 7 morphological classes , @xmath69 ( corresponding to e in the hubble type , or @xmath70 in rc3 type ) , 1 ( s0 , @xmath71 to @xmath72 ) , 2 ( sa , @xmath73 ) , 3 ( sb , @xmath74 ) , 4 ( sc , @xmath75 ) , 5 ( sdm , @xmath76 ) , and 6 ( i m , @xmath77 ) , where @xmath78 refers to the type index defined in the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "this classification is coarser than the standard rc3 types , but we consider that our classification is sufficient for most purposes for galaxy science .",
    "four of the present authors ( mh , ti , so , and ms ) independently classified all galaxies by eye , by comparing the image of each galaxy displayed on the saoimage viewer with template galaxies of frei & gunn ( 1994 ) which are given morphological types by rc3 .",
    "the templates of frei & gunn cover from e to i m .",
    "when one can not assign a morphology to a galaxy , an index of @xmath72 is given .",
    "for each galaxy , we adopt a median of four classifiers as the final value of @xmath79 ( a half integer means that the median falls in the middle ) . in finding a median",
    "we ignore @xmath80 when one or two classifiers give this index ( no galaxy was given @xmath72 by more than two classifiers ) . in this way",
    "some galaxies are given half integer values of @xmath79 .",
    "the catalog will be published elsewhere ( fukugita et al . ,",
    "unpublished ) .",
    "we have identified the 54 galaxies listed in rc3 and in run 745 .",
    "figure 3 compares our morphology @xmath81 with that given in rc3 , @xmath78 , for the 54 galaxies .",
    "the size of the symbol is set so that its area is proportional to the number of galaxies in the grid .",
    "the curve connects points where our morphology matches with rc3 morphology .",
    "a tight correlation is seen between the two classifications . for a given @xmath81",
    "the average discrepancy in the two classifications ( in units of @xmath78 ) is @xmath82 with the rms scatter of 1.8 .",
    "naim et al . ( 1995 ) compared experts classifications and concluded that the rms scatter among classifiers is @xmath83 . somewhat larger discrepancy between our classification and that given in rc3 may be expected , owing to the fact that we have estimated morphology from ccd images for which the contrast and grey scale are not fixed , whereas rc3 classification is based on photographic materials .",
    "on the other hand , naim et al . used the identical prints for test classifications . in view of these considerations",
    "we take our classification to be acceptable . in specific details",
    ", our classification tends to classify some s0 galaxies as e , and classify spiral galaxies into somewhat later types .",
    "figure 4 shows the morphological type distribution of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the relative fractions of types given in the literature ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ; loveday 1996 ) obtained in the @xmath13 or @xmath84 band are also plotted for comparison ( normalized to the total number of galaxies in our sample ) .",
    "loveday does not classify spiral galaxies into subclasses ; so his numbers are distributed evenly over classes 2 , 3 , and 4 . in our sample",
    "the number of galaxies with @xmath69 ( i.e. , e ) is significantly higher than that of @xmath85 ( s0 ) galaxies , in contrast to the other results , implying that our classifiers set the division criterion of e and s0 to be more to the s0 side than in other work .",
    "taking @xmath86 as early type ( e and s0 ) galaxies , the frequency of the early type galaxies in our sample @xmath87 is consistent with what has been known from the work in the blue bands . in the following analysis",
    "we mostly take e and s0 as a single class . to conclude this section",
    ", we quote the frequency of morphological types : @xmath88 we do not detect any significant systematic change of morphological compositions with magnitude bins .",
    "so we regard this fraction to represent a fair value for field galaxies brighter than @xmath89 mag .",
    "in figure 5 we plot ( a ) @xmath90 , ( b ) @xmath91 , ( c ) @xmath92 , and ( d ) @xmath93 colors against @xmath79 . the size of the symbol is again set so that its area is proportional to the number of galaxies falling in the grid . the mean and rms of the color distributions",
    "are calculated in table 1 , and represented in figure 6 ( a)-(d ) .",
    "as noted in section 2 , colors of each galaxy are measured for a common aperture which is defined as @xmath94 .",
    "the aperture is reasonably large , so that our color indices are regarded as representing nearly those for the total flux .",
    "we correct all colors for galactic reddening .",
    "the open squares connected by lines in figures 5 and 6 are colors calculated convolving kennicutt s ( 1992 ) spectrophotometric atlas of nearby galaxies with the responses of the sdss photometric system to give broad band colors ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ; hereafter fsi ) .",
    "we indicate in fig.6(a ) representative uncertainties in our @xmath79 measurements for early and late types by horizontal bars ( the estimate at @xmath69 and 3 ) which are estimated from the difference between our classification and that of rc3 shown in fig.3 .. ]    we observe ( more clearly in figure 6 ) that the data are distributed fairly close to the fsi calculations for ( a ) @xmath90 , ( b ) @xmath91 , and ( c ) @xmath92 colors . for @xmath91",
    "the difference between the mean of the data and the calculation is less than 0.05 except for i m ( a 0.3 mag discrepancy ) , for which the synthesis calculation uses the bluest known galaxies ( ngc4449 and ngc 4485 ) to define the envelope of the bluest color . the next largest discrepancy in @xmath91 color",
    "is seen for elliptical galaxies : the data are redder than the synthesis calculation by 0.05 mag .",
    "this level of discrepancy , however , is seen for @xmath95 color of elliptical galaxies , either with kennicutt s spectrophotometric data or with the spectroscopic energy distribution ( sed ) of coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 , hereafter cww ) , when compared with the broad band color : the template sed of elliptical galaxies is not sufficiently red to give @xmath96 obtained by broad band photometry , as noted by fsi .    for @xmath92 color",
    "the difference between the data and the fsi synthetic colors is less than 0.04 , again except for i m galaxies .",
    "the disagreement between our data and the fsi calculations is somewhat larger for @xmath90 , but the scatter is wider for this color ; we can not conclude that the disagreement is significant .",
    "we remark , however , that the calculation being redder than observation by 0.2 mag for e galaxies may be ascribed to the use of metal rich giant elliptical galaxies in constructing the composite sed .",
    "the @xmath90 index is most sensitive to the metal abundance . for i",
    "m galaxies the observed @xmath90 color is redder than the calculation because of the use of a blue template object , as we have seen for the i m type in @xmath91 .",
    "a significant deviation is seen for the @xmath93 color , for which the data are clearly bluer than the synthetic calculation by 0.1 mag for early - type galaxies and 0.2 for later - type galaxies .",
    "while the sed that covers the @xmath12 band used in fsi relies on an extrapolation from the bluer wavelengths , we can not blame this disagreement simply on an incorrect extrapolation , as we discuss in section 4.2 .",
    "we present in figure 7 color - color diagrams ( a ) @xmath91 vs. @xmath90 , ( b ) @xmath92 vs. @xmath91 , and ( c ) @xmath93 vs. @xmath92 .",
    "the dots represent each galaxy , and the curves are predictions from synthetic calculations of fsi ( filled squares ) , cww seds extended to the near infrared by neugebauer ( personal communication ) ( filled triangles ) , both of which use empirical sed of galaxies , kodama & arimoto s ( 1997 ) stellar population synthesis model ( open squares ) , and gissel of bruzual & charlot s ( 1996 , unpublished ; see also _ idem _ 1993 ) stellar population synthesis model ( open triangles ) .",
    "the convergence of the four synthesis calculations is very good for the @xmath91 vs. @xmath90 plot .",
    "a trend is visible that the sdss photometry gives a somewhat bluer @xmath90 ( or slightly redder @xmath91 ) for early type galaxies than all synthetic calculations .",
    "the agreement among synthetic calculations is still fairly good for the @xmath92 vs. @xmath91 plot ; the sdss data also closely follow the synthetic calculations . in the @xmath93 vs. @xmath92 plot ,",
    "however , the data are clearly shifted by 0.1@xmath970.2 mag downward ( bluer @xmath93 ) compared with all four synthetic curves , which mutually agree very well .",
    "pass band . ] the @xmath4 color of the sdss galaxies is deviated from all model calculations .",
    "buta & williams ( 1995 , hereafter bw ) present @xmath98 colors for 501 nearby galaxies classified into morphology according to the rc3 system .",
    "@xmath99 colors for these galaxies are given in rc3 .",
    "in this subsection , we compare sdss photometry with the bw ( and rc3 ) catalog to examine the consistency among broad band photometries .",
    "color transformations from the @xmath3 system to the sdss system are carried out using the transformation laws given in fsi .",
    "the rc3 morphology indices are also converted into our system .",
    "we adopt bw s total color to compare with our petrosian color .",
    "figure 8(a)-(d ) gives plots for the bw sample , similar to the plots in figure 5(a)-(d ) .",
    "we remark that the bw sample is not homogeneous with respect to morphology , but is highly biased towards early type galaxies .",
    "we expect , however , that this does not produce any biases to our color analysis .",
    "we overlay the data of our sample ( fig.5 ; we omit @xmath100 and @xmath101 data since no galaxy is classified as these types in the bw sample ) by open circles , with a horizontal offset of @xmath102 for clarity .    a comparison of figure 8 with 5 shows that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 distributions of the bw galaxies are grossly consistent with those for sdss photometry .",
    "the agreement of the @xmath0 colors between the two samples is particularly good , although a somewhat smaller scatter for the early type galaxies of the bw sample may be ascribed to its selection effect that the bw sample is not homogeneous .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 colors for early type galaxies are slightly bluer for the bw sample .",
    "the appreciable discrepancy found in the comparison of the two samples is with @xmath4 colors .",
    "@xmath4 colors of the sdss sample are systematically bluer than those of bw by @xmath103 mag .",
    "this trend is similar to what was found between the fsi calculation and the sdss measures of galaxies in the previous subsection .",
    "this discrepancy in @xmath4 color leads us to suspect that there may be a systematic error by @xmath5 mag in @xmath12 band photometry , but the real reason is not clear to us .",
    "the preliminary work for the sdss primary standard stars ( smith et al . 2001 ) shows that all sdss color indices relative to the johnson - morgan - cousins photometric system differ from a synthetic calculation using gunn - stryker stars ( gunn & stryker 1983 ) by no more than 0.03 mag .",
    "we have recently recognized some unexpected shifts of the filter response function in the 2.5 m camera system due to the evaporation of water vapor from silicon layer of the coating surface when the filters are soaked in a vacuum chamber , but we estimate the effect to be smaller than 0.015 mag for all color bands . the difference in the response between the front - illuminated thick ccd device used in the 2.5 m camera and the back - illuminated thin device for the photometric telescope ( which defines the sdss magnitude ) does not cause an offset of more than 0.01 magnitude .",
    "the sky brightness and its time variation are the highest in the @xmath12 band , so errors in the sky subtraction in @xmath12 band could affect photometry of galaxies .",
    "however , it is not easy to estimate photometric errors due to the sky subtraction errors , since they affect galaxy photometry in a complicated way depending on sizes and surface brightnesses of galaxies . at present , we have not found clear evidence that they account for the discrepancy in @xmath4 color .",
    "it should be , however , worth noting that the observed amount of the discrepancy in @xmath4 does not depend either on the brightness ( and size ) of galaxies nor on the position of galaxies on a strip , ie , when they were imaged .",
    "the effect of 0.1 - 0.2 mag seems a bit too large to be ascribed to the uncertainties in the present photometric system , but we can not find the reason for this discrepancy at the moment .",
    "in this section , we study the relation between apparent size and apparent brightness of galaxies .",
    "we expect different relations for different morphological types .",
    "the relation may also depend on the color band used , if star forming regions or metallicity distributions are not homogeneous throughout the galaxy .",
    "the information on the radius - brightness relation is also needed to construct a realistic simulation of galaxies .",
    "we additionally examine whether the relation derived from sdss photometry is consistent with our knowledge of the galaxy sizes we obtained from other studies of local galaxies .",
    "the consistency would allow us to supplement the sdss data with the results from other , more detailed studies , such as which have not yet been done with sdss .",
    "we consider @xmath58 estimated in the five color bands as a measure for the galaxy size .",
    "note that @xmath58 is approximately the conventionally defined effective radius ( half light radius ) .",
    "we adopt petrosian magnitudes , @xmath104 , also in the five color bands to represent apparent brightness .",
    "four panels in figure 9 show the plot of @xmath56 ( @xmath105 , and @xmath11 ) as a function of apparent brightness in the @xmath10 passbands .",
    "we divide our galaxy sample into three morphological classes on the basis of @xmath79 values : the open circles are early type galaxies with @xmath86 ( e and s0 galaxies ) , the filled circles denote @xmath106 ( s0/a to sbc ) , and the crosses are for late spiral galaxies with @xmath107 ( later than sc ) . the data are well represented by the curve @xmath108 + a_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath109 are constants that depend on @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this relation holds for any combination of the passbands @xmath112 with the parameters @xmath109 ( and their rms scatters ) being obtained by least squares fits to the plots for the three morphological classes .",
    "these parameters are given in table 2 for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and for @xmath115 .",
    "the plots in figure 9 show that half light petrosian radii @xmath58 are nearly independent of the color bands with which these radii are calculated . looking into details , however , we see the trend that the half light radius shrinks slightly from uv to redder bands for all morphological types ( see rows 1 - 5 of table 2 ) . for early type galaxies we observe a 10% decrease in the effective radius continuously from the @xmath8 to the @xmath12 band .",
    "this is interpreted as due to the effect of the color gradient of early type galaxies driven from the metallicity gradient . for spiral galaxies",
    "the decrease is 20 - 25% .",
    "this represents the star forming component being more extended towards outer parts of galaxies : in other words an increasingly dominant importance of the bulge component in redder passbands .",
    "the fitting formulae with @xmath116 give useful parameters ( see rows 6 - 10 of table 2 ) to construct simulations of galaxies .",
    "the knowledge of these parameters is particularly important in understanding the detection limit of galaxies and the performance of star galaxy classification .",
    "let us now investigate the consistency of eq.(5 ) with the relation involving the effective radius known in the literature .",
    "the most accurate study concerning the scale of galaxies is presented by kent ( 1985 ) on the basis of excellent thuan - gunn @xmath117 band ccd images of nearby bright galaxies with known redshifts .",
    "he derived the relations between intrinsic size and surface brightness separately for the bulge and disk components . using the transformation law of fsi",
    ", we convert his relations between the effective radius ( kpc ) and the effective surface brightness ( mag arcsec@xmath118 ) to those in the sdss @xmath10 band as , @xmath119 + 20.3 ( { \\rm mag~sec}^{-2})\\ ,    \\hspace{20pt } { \\rm ( e , s0)}\\ ] ] @xmath119 + 20.5   ( { \\rm mag~sec}^{-2})\\ ,   \\hspace{20pt } { \\rm ( disks)}\\ ] ] where we have assumed the hubble constant to be 100 km s@xmath120 mpc@xmath120 .",
    "when these relations are fitted to the sdss data for @xmath121 ( bulge dominated ) and @xmath107 ( disk dominated ) , we obtain for the effective radius @xmath17 defined by @xmath122 $ ] for the de vaucouleurs profile and the scale length defined by @xmath123 for the exponential disk ,    @xmath124    and @xmath125 where the errors indicate the @xmath126 range .",
    "note that the average luminosity of galaxies that contribute to galaxy number counts in the bright magnitude is very close to @xmath6 ( within @xmath1270.1 mag error for @xmath128 mag ) with the slope of the schechter function @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the values given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : re - dev ] ) and ( [ eq : re - exp ] ) represent the average sizes for the @xmath6 galaxies .",
    "our data indicate that the mean @xmath18 derived from late type disks is about the same value as the mean @xmath17 of early type galaxies . with these two parameters , our data are consistent with the relations derived by kent ( 1985 ) .",
    "we define the ( inverse ) concentration index by the ratio of the two petrosian radii @xmath130 measured in the @xmath10 band .",
    "figure 10 shows @xmath131 against @xmath79 ( see also table 3 ) .",
    "we have dropped 30 galaxies having @xmath132 , since large smearing effects are suspected for @xmath131 for such small galaxies unless significant corrections are made for the seeing ( average fwhm is @xmath133 ) .",
    "the two filled squares with error bars near the top of the panel show the typical errors in @xmath81 measurements at @xmath69 and 3 .",
    "a tight correlation is seen between @xmath131 and @xmath79 ; @xmath131 increases with @xmath79 , which is understood by the spheroid or bulge dominance of early type galaxies and an increasing disk dominance of later - type galaxies .",
    "we have studied similar plots for galaxies with magnitudes divided into three bins , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "no systematic effects are observed among the samples with different apparent brightnesses ( hence different apparent sizes ) of galaxies , in so far as we limit ourselves to galaxies with @xmath137 .",
    "the galaxies with @xmath132 show a weaker correlation between @xmath131 and @xmath79 due to smearing by seeing but also possibly due to errors of eye classification . and @xmath79 .",
    "we have found that the correlation does not change appreciably againt the sample with specified minor - to - major axis ratio .",
    "our concentration index defined using the petrosian radii is a robust indicator against inclination of galaxies . ]",
    "the scatter in @xmath131 for a given @xmath79 is larger than expected from the errors in our @xmath79 measurements .",
    "this reflects the fact that galaxies with a given morphology have a fairly wide range of the bulge - to - disk ratio ( e.g. , kent 1985 ; simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ; kodaira , watanabe , & okamura 1986 ) and the bulge - to - disk ratio is directly related to the concentration index .",
    "we examined the correlations of visual morphology with a number of parameters measured by _",
    "( likelihoods of a fitting to the de vaucouleurs or exponential profiles , texture parameters defined by _ photo _ ) in addition to the three parameters studied in this paper .",
    "the correlation of the likelihood of profile fitting and of the texture parameter with our visual morphology is not strong ( we used the version of _ photo _ version  @xmath138 of late 1999 ) .",
    "the concentration index shows the strongest correlation with visual morphology , and a combination of the concentration index with other parameters , such as surface brightness , color , asymmetry parameter , does not appreciably enhance the correlation .",
    "the concentration index is perhaps the best parameter to be used to classify morphology of galaxies .",
    "this is basically the same conclusion as reached by doi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and further corroborated by abraham et al .",
    "these authors used a combination of a concentration index and mean surface brightness , while the concentration index is sufficient for our case .",
    "this simplification arises merely from the different definition of the concentration indices . in doi",
    "et al . and",
    "abrahams et al .",
    "the concentration index is defined using isophotal photometry .",
    "the calculated index then depends on both apparent brightness and distance of galaxies . to correct for these redundant effects",
    "the second parameter is needed , and those authors took average surface brightness , which also depends on apparent brightness and the distance . in our case",
    "the petrosian quantities are physically well defined , independent of the apparent brightness or the distance .",
    "therefore the introduction of a second parameter is unnecessary .",
    "the correlation in figure 10 suggests that the @xmath131 parameter can be used for morphological classification allowing for the uncertainty of roughly @xmath139 ( see table 3 above ) .",
    "the most important problem in the classification using the @xmath131 parameter is that the @xmath131 parameter for sa galaxies can be as small as that for e galaxies , making it difficult to construct a purely early type galaxy sample free from a contamination of sa galaxies .",
    "as noted above this problem is not ameliorated with the use of any second parameters we studied . on the other hand ,",
    "the distinction between s0 and sa is not too difficult , allowing for some intermediate cases , upon visual inspections due to the presence of spiral arms and/or hii regions in sa galaxies , which are not properly picked up with the parameters given by _",
    "photo_.    a practically important application is to distinguish e / s0 galaxies from spiral galaxies . here",
    "we consider this problem in a more quantitative way , and study the completeness and contamination of the morphologically classified sample with the use of the @xmath131 parameter .",
    "the upper panel of figure 11 shows the completeness as a function of @xmath131 : the solid curve represents the completeness of early type galaxies when sample is selected with @xmath140 for a given @xmath141 , while the dashed curve represents the completeness of the late type galaxy sample with @xmath142 .",
    "the completeness of the two samples balances with @xmath143 at 80% . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower panel of figure 11 indicates the contamination from the opposite type .",
    "namely , the solid curve is the contamination from late type galaxies to the early type galaxy sample with @xmath140 .",
    "the dashed curve is the contamination by early type galaxies to the late type sample with @xmath144 .",
    "the two curves become even at @xmath145 .",
    "the inspection of two curves in the lower panel of figure 11 shows that we can make a reasonably pure late type galaxy sample with the choice of large @xmath141 , say , 0.37 at a loss of completeness ( 70% completeness ; contamination is less than 5% ) .",
    "the opposite is not true : one can not decrease the contamination of an early type sample by late type galaxies below 15% , whatever value of @xmath141 is chosen , as a result of a contamination from sa galaxies .",
    "our recommended choice of @xmath141 is 0.33 if we want dichotomous classification of galaxies into early and late types . for this specific choice",
    "the completeness and contamination are given in table 4 .",
    "93 out of the 136 early type ( e / s0 ) galaxies are classified as ` early ' types , i.e. , a completeness of @xmath146 . on the other hand , 24 ` early'-type galaxies are not real e / s0 galaxies , which means a contamination of @xmath147 ( 24/117 ) .",
    "similarly , the fraction of late type ( sa - im ) galaxies classified as ` late ' types is @xmath148 ( 266/290 ) and the contamination in the ` late ' galaxy sample from early type galaxies is @xmath149 ( 43/309 ) .    in summary",
    ", our analysis demonstrates that the parameter @xmath130 is useful for automated classification of early and late type galaxies , if one is satisfied with a completeness of @xmath150 , allowing for a contamination of @xmath151 .",
    "it appears difficult to improve the performance with the use of simple photometric parameters .",
    "further improvement requires the introduction of more complicated parameters such as those characterizing the presence of spiral arms and hii regions .",
    "an improvement of late type galaxy classification may be achieved with the introduction of the asymmetry parameter ( e.g. , abraham et al . 1996 ) .",
    "we have produced a morphologically classified sample of 456 bright galaxies from imaging data which were taken during the sloan digital sky survey commissioning phase .",
    "we have classified galaxies into seven hubble types ( e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , sdm , and i m ) by visual inspections carried out by four individuals .",
    "we have measured the distributions of colors , scale lengths , and concentration indices in the sdss photometric system as functions of morphology .",
    "our prime purposes are ( i ) to derive the fundamental statistical properties of galaxies in the sdss passbands , ( ii ) to examine the consistency with existing galaxy data other than the sdss , and ( iii ) to find the parameters that can be used for an efficient automated morphological classifier .",
    "all parameters we have studied in this paper , except for visually determined morphology , are among the standard outputs from the sdss image analysis software ( _ photo _ ) , and thus routinely registered in the sdss photometric catalog .",
    "we have found that the colors of our galaxies in the sdss system match with those obtained from template sed data and from @xmath3 broad band photometry of nearby galaxies to within @xmath1520.05 mag .",
    "the exception is @xmath4 color for which the discrepancy is as large as 0.1 - 0.2 mag .",
    "we could not find the origin of this discrepancy yet .",
    "we found that the half light radius falls on the line @xmath153 , and the constant we found indicates @xmath154 kpc for de vaucouleurs profiles , and @xmath155 kpc for exponential disks of late type spiral galaxies with the aid of the surface brightness radius relation derived by kent ( 1985 ) .",
    "we found additionally that the half light radius of galaxies depends slightly on the color band and the dependence is consistent with the expected distribution of star forming regions for late type galaxies and with the known color gradient in early type galaxies .",
    "finally , we have shown that the concentration index shows a strong correlation with the morphological types .",
    "we explored the possibility of using this parameter for automated morphological classification of galaxies , in order to classify a huge number of galaxies into early , intermediate , and late types with parameters that are routinely produced in the photometric data processing of the sdss .",
    "for an optimum ratio of @xmath156_1 \\equiv c_1=0.33 $ ] , we find , however , a @xmath157 contamination from opposite types of galaxies . the contamination is particularly important for the early type galaxy sample , and we must consider some higher order photometric parameters to enhance the performance .",
    "_ photo _ has been continuously updated over the years . after we submitted our paper , strateva et al .",
    "( submitted to aj ) found on the basis of a different sample ( 287 galaxies at @xmath158 ) that the likelihood of profile fitting based on a later version of _ photo _ ( @xmath159 ) correlates with eye morphology better than we found .",
    "however , they also found that the profile fitting does not work well in comparison with concentration index for bright galaxies such as those we study in our paper .",
