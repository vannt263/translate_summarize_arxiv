    "in the @xmath0  years since antineutrinos were first detected using a nuclear reactor as the source  @xcite , these facilities have played host to a large number of neutrino physics experiments .",
    "about two decades later it was realized  @xcite that the techniques and technologies developed for the study of neutrino physics could also be applied to nuclear reactor monitoring in the context of nuclear safeguards .",
    "this capability was demonstrated by several later physics experiments  @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been pointed out that the field of antineutrino detection has matured sufficiently to envisage the deployment of practical devices dedicated to reactor safeguards  @xcite .",
    "safeguards agencies , such as the iaea , use an ensemble of procedures and technologies to detect diversion of fissile materials from civil nuclear fuel cycle facilities into weapons programs .",
    "nuclear reactors generate up to several hundreds of kilograms of plutonium per year , and are thus an especially important part of this cycle , as it is here that plutonium is produced .",
    "current safeguards practice at reactors is focused upon tracking fuel assemblies through item accountancy and surveillance , and does not typically include direct measurements of fissile inventory .",
    "while containment and surveillance practices are considered effective , they are also costly and time consuming for both the agency and the reactor operator .    in this paper , we describe how we observe the effect of fuel evolution upon the rate at which the reactor emits antineutrinos .",
    "this data was acquired using a simple , robust , and nonintrusive detector , `` songs1 ''  @xcite , which we have installed at a commercial nuclear power reactor .",
    "observing this evolution with an antineutrino detector allows limits to be placed upon the fissile inventory of the reactor , in particular the amount of @xmath1u consumed and @xmath2pu produced .",
    "antineutrino emission by nuclear reactors arises from the beta decay of neutron - rich fragments produced in heavy element fissions . on average ,",
    "fission is followed by the production of approximately six antineutrinos , which emerge from the core isotropically and effectively without attenuation . furthermore , the average number of detectable antineutrinos produced per fission is significantly different for the two major fissile elements , @xmath1u and @xmath2pu .",
    "hence , as the core evolves and the relative mass fractions and fission rates of @xmath1u and @xmath2pu change , the number of detected antineutrinos will also change .",
    "this relation between the mass fractions of fissile isotopes and the detectable antineutrino flux is known as the burnup effect , and has been observed consistently in previous neutrino physics experiments @xcite",
    ".    day reactor equilibrium fuel cycle.,width=288 ]    to evaluate the antineutrino production rate we begin by considering the key operational parameter of a reactor , the thermal power @xmath3 ; @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fission rate for isotope @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the average energy released per fission for this isotope .",
    "the sum runs over all fissioning isotopes .",
    "however , in practice it is sufficient to consider only the four dominant fissioning isotopes @xmath1u , @xmath8u , @xmath2pu and @xmath9pu , which account for @xmath10 of fissions in a typical reactor .    following the formulation of @xcite ,",
    "it is useful to define the power fractions contributed by each isotope as : @xmath11 even with the reactor operated at constant thermal power these fractions are time - dependent , changing by several tens of percent throughout a typical cycle as , for example , @xmath1u is consumed and @xmath2pu is produced by neutron capture on @xmath8u .    using tabulated values of the antineutrino production number densities  @xcite for each fissioning isotope , we can express the total antineutrino emission rate , @xmath12 , in terms of the thermal power and the power fractions : @xmath13 where the explicit time dependence of the power fractions and , possibly , the thermal power are noted .",
    "here , @xmath14 , is the antineutrino energy dependent number density per mev and fission for the @xmath6th isotope .",
    "antineutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay process on quasi - free protons in hydrogenous scintillator : @xmath15 .",
    "the number of antineutrinos produced per unit energy varies with isotope above the @xmath16  mev threshold for this reaction , so that the antineutrino _ detection _ rate will also vary as the fuel composition of a reactor evolves .",
    "this relation between fissile plutonium and uranium content and the antineutrino detection rate provides a means by which to use these particles to provide information relevant to reactor safeguards .    to derive the antineutrino detection rate @xmath17",
    ", we must fold the energy dependent inverse beta cross section , @xmath18 , and detector efficiency , @xmath19 , into the integral of eq .",
    "[ eq : nu_p_rate ] : @xmath20 the prefactor includes @xmath21 , the number of target protons in the active volume of the detector , and @xmath22 , the distance from the detector to the center of the reactor core .",
    "following the formulation of @xcite , it is instructive to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : nu_d_rate ] as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant encompassing all non varying terms ( e.g. detector size , detector / core geometry ) , and @xmath25 describes the change in the antineutrino flux due to changes in the reactor fuel composition .",
    "@xmath24 is chosen so that the value of @xmath26 at the beginning of a reactor fuel cycle is zero .",
    "typically , commercial reactors are operated at constant thermal power , independent of the ratio of fission rates from each isotope .",
    "operating in this mode , the factor @xmath26  and therefore the antineutrino detection rate @xmath17 decreases by about @xmath27 over the course of a reactor fuel cycle , depending on the initial fuel loading and operating history . the magnitude of this burnup effect can be predicted at the few percent level in an absolute sense , if the reactor fuel loading and power history are known .",
    "much of the uncertainty arises from systematic shifts in measured antineutrino energy densities @xmath28 , so that the relative uncertainty in the predicted burnup rate can be considerably smaller .      in order to predict @xmath25 , and thus the evolution of the detected antineutrino rate , for the songs unit  2 reactor we used the origen / scale simulation package  @xcite to predict the fission rates per isotope throughout a typical reactor fuel cycle . at discrete steps , the simulation returns the mass , fission rate , and number densities of fissile isotopes in each fuel assembly of the core .",
    "the per assembly fission rates are summed over the core to produce an estimate of the reactor evolution history ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fisrates]a ) .",
    "the input fuel isotopics for this simulation are taken from the san onofre nuclear generating station final safety analysis report ( fsar ) @xcite .",
    "this report describes a nominal fuel loading which differs by a few percent from the actual fuel load in recent cycles .",
    "while this difference will lead to a systematic shift in our predicted count rate from the true count rate , the fsar isotopics are sufficient for comparison with our current data , and have the important advantage of being publicly available and not subject to use restrictions by the utility .",
    "to predict the antineutrino detection rate , the fission rates are folded with measured or estimated antineutrino energy densities , the inverse beta interaction cross - section , and an estimate of the detector response function .",
    "the antineutrino energy densities are provided from @xmath29mev to @xmath30mev in @xmath31mev steps in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "various parameterizations exist for this data @xcite . in our parametrization",
    ", we used a cubic interpolation between adjacent data points to extract the densities and errors at intervening energies .",
    "we predict a change in the detected antineutrino rate of about @xmath32%/month ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fisrates]b ) for songs unit  2 , and a thus a decrease in rate of 10% over the course of the entire fuel cycle .",
    "similarly , we expect a step increase in the detection rate of this amount after reactor refueling , when spent fuel laden with @xmath2pu is removed and replaced with fuel containing only @xmath1u and @xmath8u .",
    "as shown in eq .  [ eq : nu_d_rate2 ] , the time dependence of the antineutrino detection rate also depends on the evolution of both the thermal power and the core isotopics . as a consequence ,",
    "an independent measurement of @xmath33 is required if antineutrino detection rate measurements alone are used to constrain reactor fissile inventory . in this case",
    ", the inspector would require access to the reactor power history .",
    "used in concert with operator declarations , antineutrino rate measurements may be of considerable safeguards value .",
    "declarations of fresh and spent fuel and operating history , whose self - consistency is already checked as part of the iaea regime , must now in addition be consistent with the slow change in antineutrino rate throughout each cycle ( `` slope '' changes ) and the sharp increase in rate observed following refueling ( `` step '' changes ) .",
    "moreover , for reactors which have proceeded through several refueling cycles , a standard operating history emerges , so that a comparison of slope and step _ between _ cycles offers additional confirmation of standard operation .",
    "this latter type of comparison is slightly different than verification within a single cycle , inasmuch as it is less dependent on year - to - year operation declarations .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the detected antineutrino energy spectrum is different for the two main fissioning isotopes .",
    "this means that a completely independent estimate of fissile content can be derived from the antineutrino _ energy spectrum _ without relying on operator declarations  @xcite .    the requirements for a detector capable of making such a spectral measurement would be considerably more stringent than is the case for a rate measurement .",
    "for example , excellent counting statistics would be required in the high energy region ( @xmath34  mev ) , necessitating a more efficient and/or larger detector , as well a good energy calibration across the entire energy range .",
    "we expect it would be difficult to design a detector with these additional features , while still preserving the operational simplicity and low cost of our current design .",
    "the songs1 detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "songs1 comprises a central target region , a @xmath35  m thick layer of passive shielding , and a plastic scintillator muon veto .",
    "the target comprises @xmath36  tons of gadolinium ( gd ) loaded liquid scintillator  @xcite contained in @xmath37  stainless steel cells each of which is readout by two photo multiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the positron ( @xmath38 ) and neutron ( @xmath39 ) produced by the inverse beta interaction are detected in close time coincidence , allowing strong rejection of the much more frequent single event backgrounds due to natural radioactivity or cosmic ray backgrounds .",
    "the incorporation of gd in the liquid scintillator greatly aids this rejection by decreasing the neutron capture time to @xmath40s , compared to @xmath41s for capture on hydrogen .",
    "unfortunately , this reaction is not the only means by which correlated pairs of interactions can be produced in the scintillator .",
    "for example , cosmic ray muons can produce fast neutrons in the material surrounding the detector ",
    "these neutrons can slow due to elastic collisions with protons , whose recoils are detected by the scintillator , and then capture on gd with the characteristic @xmath40s time constant .",
    "such processes are referred to as correlated backgrounds .",
    "it is for this reason that songs1 incorporates a muon veto system .",
    "the random coincidence of two unrelated single background interactions ( gamma rays or neutrons ) can also occur within the short time characteristic of neutron captures on gd .",
    "the statistical rejection of these _ uncorrelated backgrounds _ is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , while the passive shielding incorporated into songs1 reduces the frequency with which these occur .    a data acquisition system ( daq ) based upon standard nim and vme electronics modules records timing and pmt amplitude information .",
    "a trigger is generated when the signals from the two pmts on a cell exceed an @xmath42  mev threshold and no hit was recorded in the muon veto in the preceding @xmath43s . on a trigger ,",
    "adcs record the amplitude of all @xmath44  pmts and time - to - amplitude converter ( tac ) pulses corresponding to the time to last trigger ( interevent time ) and the time since last hit in the muon veto ( or , because of hardware limitations , the time since the last trigger , whichever is less ) .",
    "we estimate the detection efficiency of the complete songs1 detector system , including the daq , to be @xmath45 . when combined with the expected antineutrino interaction rate ( @xmath46/day ) at the beginning of cycle ,",
    "this yields an expected antineutrino detection rate of @xmath47  /day .",
    "songs1 is located in the tendon gallery of the unit  2 reactor at the san onofre nuclear generating station ( songs ) .",
    "this is an ideal location , since it places the detector as close to the reactor core as possible ( @xmath48  m ) while remaining outside containment , away from regular plant operations , and about @xmath49  m below the surface which attenuates correlated background generating cosmic ray muons .",
    "again , the details of the event selection have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the analysis begins by forming consecutive triggers streamed to disk by the daq into events pairs ( the two halves of which are denoted `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' ) .",
    "the raw data thus formed comprises prompt and delayed pmt amplitudes , the time between the prompt and delayed events , and the time between the prompt event and the last muon to traverse the veto .",
    "an online calibration is performed using a spectral feature due to the @xmath50mev @xmath51tl gamma ray from the thorium chain , which originates from the material surrounding the detector . in our relatively small detector",
    ", this feature will be shifted lower in energy due to escape of some of the gamma energy .",
    "we have used an mcnpx @xcite simulation to estimate this shift as @xmath52  mev , such that the @xmath53  mev peak would appear at @xmath54  mev .",
    "setting the analysis threshold at this peak in the energy spectrum reduces the impact of calibration uncertainties , since no extrapolation in the energy scale is needed .",
    "table  [ tab : cuts ] lists the selection cuts that are then applied to extract candidate antineutrino events ( correlated events ) .",
    "these cuts are applied to each scintillator cell separately so that each is considered an independent detector . while this results in an @xmath55% loss of detector efficiency , it allows for a more simple and flexible analysis .",
    "a brief description of each cut is given below :    _ pmt ratio cut _ : a cut on the ratio of the light seen by the two pmts on a cell , @xmath56 is enforced .",
    "this is to ensure that energy depositions that occur much closer to one pmt than the other , and that hence have an atypically large light collection efficiency , are excluded .    _",
    "prompt energy cut _ : the prompt energy threshold is placed at the calibration point , @xmath57mev , so that no extrapolation in energy is required .",
    "no events are admitted beyond @xmath58mev as it is expected , and observed , that there are very few antineutrino interactions above this energy .",
    "_ delayed energy cut _ : the delayed energy threshold is placed at @xmath59  mev .",
    "this threshold is optimized to keep the number of uncorrelated events as low as possible , which requires a high threshold , while still staying as close as possible to the @xmath54  mev calibration peak to reduce calibration uncertainties .",
    "events with delayed energy of greater than @xmath30mev are also excluded , as the predicted delayed energy spectrum is zero beyond this energy .",
    "_ time since last muon cut _ : event pairs closer in time to a muon than @xmath60s are excluded , since these have a high likelihood of having been produced by the muon .",
    "it should be noted that we apply a stricter pmt ratio cut ( less than @xmath27 ) when performing the online calibration .",
    "while this samples a smaller volume of the cell than the general event selection , it improves the reliability with which the calibration peak can be found .",
    "we are aware of no effect which alters the relative calibrations between these two volumes .",
    "for example , examination of the relative number of events passing the prompt and delayed energy cuts with these two ratio values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_stab ] ) shows little time dependent variation .     while analysis employs @xmath27 ) .",
    "the variation in this fraction over the @xmath61  month data taking period is less than @xmath62%.,width=288 ]    .list of selection cuts applied to extract candidate antineutrino events . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this study , the songs1 antineutrino detection rate was simulated throughout a 600 day fuel cycle . at day  300 in the cycle , the antineutrino detection rate is increased , as it would if pu laden fuel were exchanged for fresh fuel . for each value of the step change in rate @xmath63  simulated experiments were conducted , sampling from gaussian distributions to represent the systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of thermal power ( @xmath64 ) and the magnitude of the burnup effect ( @xmath65 ) , as well as the statistical fluctuation of the antineutrino detection rate , and a @xmath66 distribution generated .",
    "comparison of these distributions to that generated with zero step allows us to estimate the change in antineutrino detection rate required to observe such a change ( table  [ tab : sen_mc ] ) . for comparison , the step change that occurs at refuelling ,",
    "when @xmath67  kg of @xmath2pu is replaced with @xmath42  tons of @xmath1u , is @xmath68  counts per day .",
    "the songs1 data demonstrate a clear correlation between the changes in the reactor antineutrino emission rate and the evolution of the reactor power and fissile inventory . while the sensitivity differs according to the specific fuel loading and operating history ,",
    "our data and simulations show that changes in antineutrino rate throughout a fuel cycle , including both rate `` slope '' and `` step '' information , can be used in conjunction with power declarations to constrain the amount of @xmath2pu being produced or removed at the level of about @xmath69  kg .",
    "high - statistics antineutrino rate measurements of the kind presented here can be used to quantitatively verify operator inventory and operating history declarations , complementing the containment and surveillance based approach that prevails in the current iaea reactor safeguards regime .",
    "comparison of the antineutrino rate changes from fuel cycle to fuel cycle also provides independent verification that the reactor is being run in a consistent fashion across cycles . since in this case",
    "only self - consistency of the antineutrino measurements across cycles is demanded , such an approach reduces dependence on operator declarations .",
    "the songs1 deployment has also demonstrated that an antineutrino detector can be operated stably and without interruption or maintenance for many months to a year or longer , using background gamma rays as the sole means of calibration , and with remote real - time retrieval of data and detector state - of health information . with appropriate protection against tampering ,",
    "this makes remote quantitative verification of reactor operations possible , and may thereby allow a reduction in the frequency of site visits by iaea or other inspectors .",
    "further work must be done to study specific scenarios , and to consider safeguards tasks of particular interest to the iaea , such as the study of different reactor types and power ratings . in terms of detector development",
    ", further improvements in precision and ease of operation are being pursued through iterations on the current detector design .",
    "ultimately , complete independence from declarations may be made possible through measurements of the antineutrino energy spectrum , using a somewhat more sophisticated detector .",
    "we are deeply indebted to the management and staff of the san onofre nuclear generating station for site access and the excellent support they have provided us .",
