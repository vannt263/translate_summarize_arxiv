    "the dynamics of swarms of active particles has been studied intensively in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "much of the work is based on the assumption that each particle of the swarm moves with a velocity determined by its own activity and by the local fluid flow velocity arising from the flow patterns of surrounding particles .",
    "the flow pattern of each particle is centered on that particle and is carried along with the particle velocity . due to the perpetual change of particle positions this leads to an interesting many - body problem with complicated dynamics .",
    "the assumptions in the theory , as used in practice , can be questioned on two counts .",
    "first , it is usually assumed that at each point in time the net steady state flow pattern of each particle is all that needs to be considered .",
    "in fact the net flow pattern must be regarded as the time average over a period of the swimming or flying motion . on the fast time scale of the period",
    "there is an additional oscillating flow pattern .",
    "the phase of the oscillating pattern is important and affects the hydrodynamic interaction and hence the swimming velocities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "second , a net steady state flow pattern is often assumed without derivation from a swimming motion on the fast time scale .    in the following",
    "we study the second assumption on the basis of low reynolds number hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore the fluid equations of motion are stokes equations for a viscous incompressible fluid , and inertia effects are neglected . in stokes",
    "hydrodynamics the flow at each point in space is determined instantaneously by the no - slip boundary condition on the surface of each of the particles .",
    "we study a single distorting sphere and calculate the resulting net flow pattern to second order in the amplitude of stroke .",
    "it turns out that a commonly assumed active particle flow pattern , of so - called @xmath0 type , can not be realized as the result of the swimming motion of a distorting sphere .",
    "in particular this calls into question the calculation of the hydrodynamic interaction of two swimming micro - organisms for which the @xmath0 model was first proposed @xcite .",
    "we conclude that instead of assuming a particular net steady state flow pattern for an active particle it is preferable to consider a swimmer characterized by a combination of low order oscillating multipole moments and to calculate the corresponding net flow pattern .",
    "several examples of such explicit calculations are presented .",
    "each of the resulting net flow patterns can be used in the dynamics of swarms of active particles , though with the caveat that the phase of stroke may be relevant in hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we consider a sphere of radius @xmath1 immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath2 .",
    "the fluid is of infinite extent and at rest at infinity .",
    "it is made to move as a result of shape deformations of the sphere , which change the undeformed sphere with surface @xmath3 into a body with surface @xmath4 at time @xmath5 .",
    "the fluid flow equations are formulated conveniently in the instantaneous rest frame of the body .",
    "it is assumed that in this frame the flow velocity @xmath6 and the pressure @xmath7 satisfy the stokes equations of low reynolds number hydrodynamics @xcite @xmath8 the flow velocity is assumed to satisfy the no - slip condition at the surface @xmath4 . a point on the surface @xmath3 of the undeformed sphere",
    "is denoted by @xmath9 , and the corresponding point on the surface @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath10 , with displacement vector @xmath11 .",
    "the no - slip condition reads @xcite @xmath12    we place the origin of a cartesian system of coordinates at the center of the sphere @xmath3 . by definition @xmath13",
    "we also exclude the radial displacement corresponding to uniform expansion of the sphere .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the displacement is axially symmetric and choose the axis of symmetry as @xmath14 axis . as a consequence",
    "the flow velocity and pressure are also axially symmetric , and the body acquires a translational velocity @xmath15 in the direction of the @xmath14 axis , but no rotational velocity .    in spherical coordinates @xmath16 the flow velocity can be expanded in terms of a set of fundamental solutions of the stokes equations ( 2.1 ) , @xmath17 with @xcite @xmath18,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ v$}}_l(r,\\theta)&=&\\bigg(\\frac{a}{r}\\bigg)^l\\big[(l+1)p_l(\\cos\\theta){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}_r+\\frac{l-2}{l}p^1_l(\\cos\\theta){\\mbox{\\boldmath $ e$}}_\\theta\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with legendre polynomials @xmath19 and associated legendre functions @xmath20 in the notation of edmonds @xcite . in the second sum in eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) the term @xmath21 is missing on account of the requirement that the body exert no net force on the fluid .",
    "it follows from the expansion eq . ( 2.4 ) that the translational velocity @xmath22 may be calculated from the identity @xmath23 where the integral is over any large sphere centered at the origin and enclosing the body completely . the pressure corresponding to eq .",
