    "the problem of transport in velocity fields characterized by different flow regimes in different subareas ( i.e. a `` spatially disordered set of streamlines '' @xcite ) has been considered by many authors .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to steady and time - dependent oceanic and atmospheric flows with recirculations @xcite and the related problem of the dispersion in porous media @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on flows with recirculations of geophysical interest .",
    "the study of transport properties in presence of recirculations has a crucial relevance , since gyre- or eddy - like recirculating patterns are ubiquitous features in different areas of the world ocean and atmosphere . in the ocean",
    "these features are typically induced by forcing spatial structures at the boundaries ( e.g. bottom topography , wind stress curl , coast - lines ) or by intrinsic dynamical reasons ( mesoscale eddies ) , one interacting with the other ( for a general reference see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that large - scale meandering jets , which are typically associated with the extensions of western boundary currents , often separate ocean regions characterized by different physical and biogeochemical characteristics .",
    "consequently , the study of mixing processes in correspondence of them is important also for multidisciplinary investigations @xcite ( e.g. the biological effects of longitudinal transport in western boundary current extensions see @xcite ) .",
    "the systems we consider are characterized by the joint presence of open streamline areas where particle motion is essentially a ballistic flight and closed streamline regions typically distributed according to a periodic geometry , where particles tend to be trapped . the easiest way to study the transport properties in such systems",
    "is by averaging over smaller space or over shorter time scales .",
    "typically , this results in the possibility of describing dispersion by an equation for macroscopic quantities of the system such as the average passive scalar concentration in terms of an effective drift and an effective diffusivity ( as classically done by taylor @xcite ; see @xcite , for a detailed discussion ) , at least in the case of standard diffusion .",
    "however , a description in terms of equations for macroscopic quantities needs to average out the small scale ( fast ) features of the velocity field and thus such approach applies only for asymptotic times , when particles have been able to thoroughly sample the different flow regimes in the system .    as stressed by young @xcite , before reaching this asymptotic regime very interesting transient behaviors , which can not be described within an effective diffusion model , could occur .",
    "the transient regime may be very long and , if the system is finite , the asymptotic one may not be reached .",
    "this is , typically , the case of finite domain systems with no large scale separation between the size of the domain and the largest characteristic eulerian length . in realistic flows , which are usually characterized by a fairly limited number of recirculations , fluid particles ordinarily sample just a fraction of the available regimes .",
    "therefore , it is often not possible to characterize dispersion simply in terms of asymptotic quantities such as average velocity and diffusion coefficients : different approaches are needed , as done in @xcite for the characterization of transport in closed domains ; such as the symbolic dynamics approach to the sub - diffusive behavior in a stochastic layer and to mixing in meandering jets respectively described in @xcite and @xcite ; or the study of tracer dynamics in open flows in terms of chaotic scattering by tl and coworkers @xcite ; and the exit time approach of @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe dispersion in finite size systems . in particular , we want to characterize flows with a small number of recirculations using some ideas stemming from the chaotic scattering theory .    in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly review some methods for the study of transport in non asymptotic regimes , namely the finite - size diffusion coefficients and the exit time statistics originated from the chaotic scattering phenomenon .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] contains a description of the two studied models ( traveling wave and meandering jet ) and some numerical results .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to the comparison between numerical results and a probabilistic model .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the investigation of passive tracer diffusion is usually reduced to the study of an effective equation describing the long - time , large - distance average tracer concentration behavior . under rather general hypotheses ,",
    "given an eulerian velocity field the long - time transport process is uniquely characterized by the effective diffusion ( or diffusivity ) tensor @xmath0 : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of the tracer particle at time @xmath3 ; @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the spatial dimension ; the average is taken over the tracer initial conditions or , equivalently , over an ensemble of tracer particles .",
    "the effective diffusion tensor @xmath6 takes into account the molecular diffusivity and the details of the velocity field . even in presence of simple eulerian fields ( e.g. laminar and periodic in time ) the diffusion coefficient as a function of the parameters of the velocity field",
    "can display a rather non trivial behavior @xcite    it is worth underlining that the diffusivity tensor ( [ eq : eddydiff ] ) is mathematically well defined only in the asymptotic limit , therefore its use in finite size domains yields meaningful results only if the characteristic length @xmath7 of the velocity field is much smaller than the size of the domain .",
    "if this is not the case ( e.g. in many geophysical settings or plasma physics @xcite ) , dispersion can be characterized more satisfactorily using concepts and techniques borrowed by the dynamical systems theory which will be discussed in the following .    as an example , consider the relative diffusion of a cloud of @xmath8 test particles in a smooth velocity field with characteristic length @xmath7 and assume that the lagrangian motion is chaotic . denoting with @xmath9 the radius of the cloud : @xmath10 with @xmath11 we expect the following regimes to hold @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the generalized lyapunov exponent @xcite , @xmath14 is the diffusion coefficient under the assumption of isotropy , @xmath15 , and the over - bar denotes the average over initial conditions of the cloud . equation ( [ example1 ] ) states that as long as the size of the cloud is relatively small , chaotic behavior prevails ; later on , dispersion displays a diffusive behavior .    another way to describe the above behavior , even though at first glance rather artificial , is by introducing the `` doubling time '' @xmath16 at scale @xmath17 as follows : define a series of thresholds @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the initial size of the cloud , and then measure the time @xmath20 it takes for the growth from @xmath19 to @xmath21 , and so on for @xmath22 up to the largest considered scale . though strictly speaking the term `` doubling time '' refers to the threshold rate @xmath23 , any value can be chosen for @xmath24 , even if a too large one might not separate different scale contributions .",
    "performing @xmath25 experiments with different initial conditions for the cloud , we define an average doubling time @xmath16 at scale @xmath17 as @xmath26 it is worth noting that the average in ( [ def : taudelta ] ) is different from the usual time average ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .",
    "a finite size diffusion coefficient @xmath27 can then be introduced as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the finite size lagrangian lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the lyapunov exponent @xmath30 can be obtained from @xmath31 for @xmath32 , namely @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "for a tracer cloud of non - infinitesimal size @xmath35 depends on the details of the nonlinear mechanisms of expansion : in the case of standard diffusion @xmath27 is a constant , i.e. @xmath36 @xcite . thus @xmath37    the fixed scale analysis allows us to extract physical information at different spatial scales avoiding some unpleasant consequences resulting from working at a fixed delay time @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , in presence of strong intermittency , @xmath38 as a function of @xmath3 can be rather different from one realization to another . in figure",
    "1a we present an example taken from @xcite where different exponential rates of growth for different realizations of @xmath38 produce a spurious behavior of @xmath39 .",
    "since at small scales , say @xmath40 , one typically has an exponential growth of @xmath9 due to lagrangian chaos and at large scale a diffusive behavior , one can mimic @xmath9 as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is such that @xmath9 is continuous .",
    "+ figure 1b shows the average @xmath39 versus time @xmath3 ; at large times the diffusive behavior is recovered , but at intermediate times an apparently anomalous regime occurs .",
    "this last regime is only due to the superposition of exponential and diffusive contributions by different samples at the same time . on the other hand",
    "the doubling time analysis yields unambiguous results , see figure 1c .",
    "let us remark that the above technique recovers the usual asymptotic description when there is a large scales separation and also if a genuine anomalous diffusion occurs @xcite , in addition , it constitutes a systematic method to treat situations in which the scales are not well separated .",
    "moreover , the finite size diffusion coefficient @xmath27 enables the understanding of the different spreading mechanisms at different scales .",
    "this has been recently shown in @xcite , where this method is applied to analyzing experimental trajectories described by surface drifters in the adriatic sea .",
    "another interesting approach to the study of transport properties in finite systems is the _",
    "chaotic scattering theory _ used in @xcite for passive tracer advection in open flows . in a nutshell , chaotic scattering can be summarized as follows .",
    "a particle arriving from , say , @xmath43 enters a region ( defined as the scattering , or interacting , region ) where due to the presence of a potential it scatters , then exits and goes to @xmath44 .",
    "typically , for a rather general class of potentials @xcite the time a particle takes to escape from the scattering region can be very sensitive on the impact parameter @xmath45 and thus displaying a _ chaotic _",
    "character ( like a ball in a pinball game ) .",
    "this justifies the definition in terms of chaos , even if since chaos is a time - asymptotic concept , from a technical point of view this kind of behavior is not chaotic : particles after a transient ( even if very long ) leave the scattering region and enter a regular motion regime .",
    "a nice example of the application of chaotic scattering theory in passive tracer study is given in @xcite for the motion of lagrangian tracers in blinking vortex - sink system and in a von karman vortex street behind a cylinder in a channel .",
    "tracer particles can temporarily be trapped in certain regions , e.g. the wakes of the von karman street , performing very irregular paths . on the other hand , since the non stationarity of the flow is mainly restricted to a finite mixing region around the obstacles , the asymptotic almost free particle motion is also recovered .    for the use of the exit time approach for the transport and mixing in volume preserving maps",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analogy between chaotic scattering , occurring in hamiltonian systems , and passive scalar motion can be drawn in formal terms for two dimensional incompressible velocity field @xcite . in this case",
    "the eulerian field is described by a stream - function @xmath46 , and the corresponding equations for the lagrangian evolution are : @xmath47 the equations ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) are nothing but the canonical equations for a one dimensional time dependent hamiltonian system , where the stream function plays the role of the hamiltonian .    since in chaotic scattering",
    "the particle exit time from the interacting region depends strongly on the initial conditions , it is interesting to look at the time delay function @xcite , i.e. the exit time as a function of the initial position , @xmath48 , e.g. with @xmath49 . in presence of chaotic scattering @xmath50 ,",
    "displays a rather irregular shape ( see , e.g. , fig . 5.18 in @xcite ) .",
    "as already remarked , since in chaotic scattering the irregular character is confined both in space and time ( i.e. one has the so - called transient chaos ) , the lyapunov exponent is trivially zero ; however , a sort of high sensitivity on initial conditions is suggested by the occurrence of very different time delays for very close deployment locations .",
    "the presence of large excursions for the exit time has an obvious relevance for transport processes in finite size systems .",
    "the wild variations of @xmath51 pose severe limits on the possibility to make prediction on the particles behavior and force us to use statistical approaches .",
    "this leads to introduce the probability distribution function , @xmath52 , of the exit times @xmath53 .",
    "in this paper two idealized flow models are studied ; both are reminiscent of oceanographic features .",
    "we consider finite amplitude rossby waves in a channel , recently revisited in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the reference frame",
    "moving with the phase speed of the wave , the flow field shows a central open streamline region ( ballistic motion ) sided by trapping recirculations ( see fig .",
    "2a ) ; this flow pattern is a suitable , even if simplified , prototype for studying the effect of a finite number of trapping areas on the longitudinal dispersion of particles .",
    "the two - dimensional incompressible rossby wave flow @xcite here considered is specified by the following stream - function : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is related to the maximum velocity in the @xmath56direction , ( @xmath57 ) is the wave vector and @xmath58 is the phase speed of the primary wave in the @xmath59direction . in ( [ eq:3.1 ] )",
    "@xmath60 is expressed in the reference frame co - moving with the primary wave .    in order to reproduce the instabilities usually present in geophysical flows ,",
    "we introduce a time - periodic perturbation , @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a ( not necessarily small ) parameter which controls the amplitude of the perturbation and ( @xmath64 ) is the wave - vector of the perturbation ( secondary wave ) .",
    "even though realistic disturbances can not be characterized in terms of a single wave alone @xcite , the perturbation ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) is a first step towards a description of the complex structure of transport mechanisms in these systems .",
    "the second flow we investigate is a meandering jet , which represents a natural extension of the above rossby wave system , and it was extensively studied in the literature with particular reference to the gulf stream @xcite .",
    "again , the flow can be subdivided into different regions roughly corresponding to a prograde flow ( in reality , the current jet core ; in our schematization , the open streamline regime ) , recirculation regions and , at a farther distance , an essentially quiescent ( far ) field ( see fig .",
    "we consider now fluid particle trajectories in the two - dimensional kinematic model originally proposed by bower @xcite and thereafter widely studied @xcite .",
    "the large - scale flow , in a reference frame moving eastward with a velocity coinciding with the meander phase speed and suitably nondimensionalized , is expressed by the stream function : @xmath65   + cy\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq:3.2.1}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "2b we show the streamlines in the co - moving frame .    as mentioned above , chaotic advection may be introduced trough a time dependence . among the different mechanisms discussed in @xcite , we chose here a time - periodic oscillation of the meander amplitude : @xmath66 where we set @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the parameters choice is mainly motivated by observations and numerical results , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth underlining that , even if quite a great deal of efforts has been devoted to study fluid exchange across the jet @xcite , very little is known as to tracer behavior in the along - jet direction ( periodic flows with open streamlines have been proposed as model for the meandering jets ; the presence of recirculations has been seen to induce non - trivial effects on the along - jet dispersion , see @xcite ) .",
    "tracer particle trajectories have been numerically generated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2.9 ] ) with the stream - functions corresponding to the traveling wave ( [ eq:3.1]-[eq:3.2 ] ) and the meandering jet ( [ eq:3.2.1]-[eq:3.2.2 ] ) . however , since the results relative to the two flows are qualitatively the same , we shall present and discuss just those obtained for the meandering jet .    as can be seen from the streamfunctions ,",
    "the two flows are periodic in the longitudinal direction .",
    "since we are interested in the characterization of longitudinal transport , the number of elementary flow structures ( or cells ) , @xmath71 , constituting the system , is a crucial parameter .",
    "for very large @xmath71 , the dispersion properties of the system can be studied using asymptotic techniques , e.g. the multiscale method @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", we mainly concentrate on systems with a small number of cells , namely @xmath72 .",
    "the first focus of our analysis is the particle exit time ( or time delay function , see sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] ) as a function of the initial position , i.e. the time @xmath53 a tracer particle deployed at @xmath73 takes to reach the boundary @xmath74 .",
    "two very different scenarios occur for large and small @xmath71 .",
    "3a - d show the behavior of @xmath51 for @xmath75 . increasing the system size",
    "there is a clear change in the shape of @xmath51 : highly inhomogeneous structures ( fractal objects ) for low @xmath71 ( figs .",
    "3a , b ) , with very strong fluctuations of the exit time value even for small variations of the initial conditions . as @xmath71 increases",
    ", the shape of @xmath51 becomes more and more homogeneous .",
    "the fractal character of @xmath51 is evident from figs .",
    "3a and the enlargements figs .",
    "4a - b , which suggest the self - similarity of the structures at different scales .",
    "this can be quantitatively assessed studying the correlation dimension @xmath76 of the initial condition set @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . using the grassberger and procaccia algorithm @xcite ,",
    "i.e. computing the percentage @xmath79 of pairs @xmath80 such that @xmath81 ; for small @xmath24 we obtain @xmath82 ( shown in fig .",
    "5 ) with @xmath83 .",
    "the value of @xmath84 can depend weakly on the threshold @xmath85 , e.g. for @xmath86 and the parameters of fig .",
    "3a @xmath84 results @xmath87 and @xmath88 yields @xmath89    let us remark that also for very large values of @xmath71 some fractal structures may be present , in particular , on very small scales ( detectable only for infinitesimally close particles ) .",
    "however , we do not consider this feature because on those scales in real fluids we expect the presence of smoothing due to molecular diffusion .    in order to characterize the system behavior ,",
    "we have also studied the probability density function @xmath90 . in figs .",
    "6a - d the probability density functions @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath75 are shown . for large @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "6c , d ) @xmath90 displays an asymptotic shape which can be obtained with simple probabilistic arguments ( see below , sect .  [ sec:4 ] ) , whereas in the opposite case ( fig .",
    "6a , b ) the distributions exhibit sharp peaks in correspondence of the ballistic time and exponential tails indicating the possibility of very large excursions .",
    "the above results show that the dispersion process in a finite size system can not be described in terms of a unique characteristic time . as shown in figs .",
    "3a , b , for @xmath91 the exit time @xmath53 exhibits very strong fluctuations within @xmath92 orders of magnitude , which prevents the possibility to extract meaningful information just from the average of @xmath53 .",
    "this is reflected in the exit times probability distribution : for large @xmath71 the shape of the distribution suggests the appropriateness of the average exit time to describe the diffusion , whereas this is not the case for small @xmath71 , where @xmath90 exhibits exponential tails .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed some statistical properties of the lagrangian dynamics generated by the streamfunctions ( [ eq:3.1],[eq:3.2.1 ] ) ; it seems thus natural to look for probabilistic models reproducing the above properties .    the rossby wave flow ( fig .",
    "2a ) shows two different regions ; the central one characterized by ballistic motion ( open streamlines ) and particle trapping recirculations ( closed streamlines ) on both sides of the ballistic regime . the meandering jet flow ( fig .",
    "2b ) , in addition to the recirculation and ballistic ones , presents two far field regions moving retrogradely with respect to the jet core .",
    "however , with our parameter choice the far field is practically never visited by the tracer particles @xcite and thus we shall not consider them .",
    "this intrinsic subdivision of the flow fields suggests to build a discrete symbolic picture of the motion : one can label the trapping and ballistic regions with the symbols @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively and then construct a probabilistic model .",
    "since the studied flows are time periodic we express the time in number periods of the perturbation , namely @xmath95 .",
    "the simplest conceivable probabilistic model is a bernoulli scheme such that at each time the particle can be in the states @xmath94 with probability @xmath96 or @xmath93 with probability @xmath97 .",
    "however , we do not expect such a model to give a good description of the system , because once the length @xmath98 of the system ( i.e. the equivalent of @xmath71 ) is fixed , the probability @xmath99 that at time @xmath100 the particle exits from the domain depends just on the parameter @xmath96 , and just one free parameter is obviously not enough to characterize the system behavior .",
    "the natural choice for a model which take into account memory effects is a markov chain @xcite .",
    "the process is completely defined by the transition matrix @xmath101 , i.e. by the probability to go in one step to the state @xmath102 starting from the state @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) which has the properties : @xmath105 the probabilities @xmath106 to be in state @xmath103 are given by @xmath107    now we consider the following stochastic process for the evolution of a particle @xmath108 where @xmath103 represents the state visited at time @xmath109 and @xmath110 the increment in the position of the particle at time @xmath3 .",
    "then we can compute the probability @xmath99 as follows : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the probability of first arrival from state @xmath94 to the state @xmath94 in @xmath113 steps , which obeys the following recursive formula @xcite : @xmath114 where @xmath115 indicates the @xmath116-th power of the matrix @xmath117 . applying recursively the ( [ ptl ] )",
    "yields @xmath118 being @xmath119    even if , in general a one - step markov process is not enough for a detailed description of statistical properties of the dynamical system @xcite , it may result a good description as long as @xmath120 is not too small : one indeed expects that for large exit times the memory effects are less important . the expression ( [ sempli ] ) for @xmath99 has been compared with the exit time probabilities numerically computed in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] . in order to carry out the comparison between the probabilistic model and the numerical results we have first to evaluate the parameters of the model , i.e. @xmath98 , @xmath106 , @xmath121 .    in the numerical evaluation of the matrix @xmath101 and the probabilities",
    "@xmath106 we have proceeded according to the following scheme . expressing the time in number of periods of the perturbation",

    "the larger @xmath98 , the better is the fitting with numerical data , nevertheless the probability density function ( [ ptburger ] ) does not capture the tail behavior of the physical system probability @xmath99 . this is not very surprising because the process described by eq.([langevin ] ) is @xmath17-correlated in time and thus it is not able to describe long - range correlated events @xcite responsible of such a tail .",
