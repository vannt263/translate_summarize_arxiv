    "given the prominent role of @xmath1 decay in searching for physics beyond the standard model , it is of great importance to have a precise prediction for its inclusive rate and cp asymmetry in the standard model .",
    "the total inclusive @xmath1 decay rate can be calculated using a conventional operator - product expansion ( ope ) based on an expansion in logarithms and inverse powers of the @xmath11-quark mass . however , in practice experiments can only measure the high - energy part of the photon spectrum , @xmath2 , where typically @xmath12gev or slightly below ( measured in the @xmath0-meson rest frame ) @xcite . with",
    "@xmath13 restricted to be close to the kinematic endpoint at @xmath14 , the hadronic final state @xmath15 is constrained to have large energy @xmath16 but only moderate invariant mass @xmath17 . in this kinematic region ,",
    "an infinite number of leading - twist terms in the ope need to be resummed into a non - perturbative shape function , which describes the momentum distribution of the @xmath11-quark inside the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom based on phenomenological studies of shape - function effects says these effects are important near the endpoint of the photon spectrum , but they can be ignored as soon as the cutoff @xmath18 is lowered below about 1.9gev . in other words , there should be an instantaneous transition from the `` shape - function region '' of large non - perturbative corrections to the `` ope region '' , in which hadronic corrections to the rate are suppressed by at least two powers of @xmath19 .",
    "below , we argue that this notion is based on a misconception . while it is correct that once the cutoff @xmath18 is chosen below 1.9gev the decay rate can be calculated using a local short - distance expansion",
    ", we show that this expansion involves three `` large '' scales .",
    "in addition to the hard scale @xmath4 , an intermediate scale @xmath5 corresponding to the typical invariant mass of the hadronic final state @xmath15 , and a low scale @xmath6 related to the width of the energy window over which the measurement is performed , become of crucial importance .",
    "the precision of the theoretical calculations is ultimately determined by the value of the lowest short - distance scale @xmath20 , which in practice is of order 1gev or only slightly larger .",
    "the theoretical accuracy that can be reached is therefore not as good as in the case of a conventional heavy - quark expansion applied to the @xmath0 system .",
    "more likely , it is similar to ( if not worse than ) the accuracy reached , say , in the description of the inclusive hadronic decay rate of the @xmath21 lepton .",
    "while we are aware that this conclusion may come as a surprise to many practitioners in the field of flavor physics , we believe that it is an unavoidable consequence of our analysis .",
    "not surprisingly , then , we find that the error estimates for the @xmath1 branching ratio that can be found in the literature are , without exception , too optimistic .",
    "since there are unknown @xmath22 corrections at the low scale @xmath23gev , we estimate the present perturbative uncertainty in the @xmath1 branching ratio with @xmath18 in the range between 1.6 and 1.8gev to be of order 1015% .",
    "in addition , there are uncertainties due to other sources , such as the @xmath11- and @xmath24-quark masses .",
    "the combined theoretical uncertainty is of order 1520% , about twice as large as what has been claimed in the past .",
    "while this is a rather pessimistic conclusion , we stress that the uncertainty is limited by unknown , higher - order perturbative terms , not by non - perturbative effects , which we find to be under good control .",
    "therefore , there is room for a reduction of the error by means of well - controlled perturbative calculations .",
    "using recent results on the factorization of inclusive @xmath0-meson decay distributions @xcite , it is possible to derive a qcd factorization formula for the integrated @xmath1 decay rate with a cut @xmath2 on photon energy . in the region of large @xmath18",
    ", the leading contribution to the rate can be factorized in the form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is twice the width of the window in photon energy over which the measurement of the decay rate is performed .",
    "the variable @xmath27 is the `` plus component '' of the 4-momentum of the hadronic final state @xmath15 , which is related to the photon energy by @xmath28 .",
    "the endpoint region of the photon spectrum is defined by the requirement that @xmath29 , in which case @xmath30 is called a hard - collinear momentum @xcite .    in the factorization formula",
    ", @xmath31 is a hard scale , while @xmath32 is an intermediate hard - collinear scale of order the invariant mass of the hadronic final state .",
    "the precise values of these matching scales are irrelevant , since the rate is formally independent of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the hard corrections captured by the function @xmath35 result from the matching of the effective weak hamiltonian of the standard model ( or any of its extensions ) onto a leading - order current operator of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite . at tree level",
    ", @xmath36 is equal to the `` effective '' coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "the expression valid at next - to - leading order can be found in ref .",
    "the function @xmath35 is multiplied by the running @xmath11-quark mass @xmath38 defined in the @xmath39 scheme , which is part of the electromagnetic dipole operator @xmath40 .",
    "the jet function @xmath41 in ( [ ff ] ) describes the physics of the final - state hadronic jet .",
    "an expression for this function valid at next - to - leading order in perturbation theory has been derived in refs .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the jet function can be trusted as long as @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "note that the `` natural '' choices @xmath44 and @xmath45 with @xmath46 independent of @xmath4 remove all reference to the @xmath11-quark mass ( other than in the arguments of running coupling constants ) from the factorization formula .    the shape function @xmath47 parameterizes our ignorance about the soft physics associated with bound - state effects inside the @xmath0 meson @xcite .",
    "its naive interpretation is that of a parton distribution function , governing the distribution of the light - cone component @xmath48 of the residual momentum of the @xmath11 quark inside the heavy meson .",
    "once radiative corrections are included , however , a probabilistic interpretation of the shape function breaks down @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "the shape function is renormalized in ( [ ff ] ) at the intermediate hard - collinear scale @xmath34 rather than at a hadronic scale @xmath49 .",
    "this removes any uncertainties related to the evolution from @xmath34 to @xmath49 .",
    "since the shape function is universal , all that matters is that it is renormalized at the same scale when comparing different processes .",
    "the last ingredient in the factorization formula is the function @xmath50 , which describes the renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution of the hard function @xmath51 from the high matching scale @xmath33 down to the intermediate scale @xmath34 , at which the jet and shape functions are renormalized .",
    "the exact expression for this quantity and its perturbative expansion valid at next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic order can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as written in ( [ ff ] )",
    ", the decay rate is sensitive to non - perturbative hadronic physics via its dependence on the shape function .",
    "this sensitivity is unavoidable as long as the scale @xmath6 is a hadronic scale , corresponding to the endpoint region of the photon spectrum above , say , 2gev .",
    "here we are interested in a situation where @xmath18 is lowered out of the shape - function region , such that @xmath20 can be considered large compared with @xmath52 . for orientation , we note that with @xmath53gev and the cutoff @xmath54gev employed in a recent analysis by the belle collaboration @xcite one gets @xmath55gev .",
    "the values of the three relevant physical scales as functions of the photon - energy cutoff @xmath18 are shown in figure  [ fig : scales ] .",
    "this plot illustrates the fact that the transition from the shape - function region to the region where a conventional ope can be applied is not abrupt but proceeds via an intermediate region , in which a short - distance analysis based on a multi - stage ope ( msope ) can be performed .",
    "the transition from the shape - function region into the msope region occurs when the scale @xmath20 becomes numerically ( but not parametrically ) large compared with @xmath52 .",
    "then terms of order @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are non - perturbative in the shape - function region , gradually become decent expansion parameters . only for very low values of the cutoff ( @xmath58gev or so )",
    "it is justified to treat @xmath20 and @xmath5 as scales of order @xmath4 .",
    "separating the contributions associated with these scales requires a sophisticated multi - step procedure .",
    "the first step , the separation of the hard scale from the intermediate scale , has already been achieved in ( [ ff ] ) . to proceed further",
    ", we use that integrals of smooth weight functions with the shape function @xmath59 can be expanded in a series of forward @xmath0-meson matrix elements of local operators in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , provided that the integration domain is large compared with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the perturbative expansions of the associated wilson coefficient functions can be trusted as long as @xmath60 . in order to complete the scale separation ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to evolve the shape function in ( [ ff ] ) from the intermediate scale @xmath61 down to a scale @xmath62 .",
    "this can be achieved using the analytic solution to the integro - differential rg evolution equation for the shape function in momentum space @xcite .    as a final comment",
    ", we stress that the main purpose of performing the scale separation using the msope is not that this allows us to resum sudakov logarithms . indeed ,",
    "the `` large logarithm '' @xmath63 is only parametrically large , but not numerically .",
    "what is really important is to disentangle the physics at the low scale @xmath62 , which is `` barely perturbative '' , from the physics associated with higher scales , where a short - distance treatment is on much safer grounds .",
    "the msope allows us to distinguish between the three coupling constants @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( for @xmath55gev ) , which are rather different despite the fact that there are no numerically large logarithms in the problem .",
    "given the values of these couplings , we expect that scale separation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 is as important as that between @xmath4 and the weak scale @xmath67 .",
    "the scale dependence of the renormalized shape function is governed by an integro - differential rg evolution equation , whose exact solution in momentum space can be found using a technique developed in ref .",
    "the result takes the remarkably simple form @xmath68 the exact expression for the evolution function @xmath69 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath70 is given in terms of the cusp anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "relation ( [ sonice ] ) accomplishes the evolution of the shape function from the intermediate scale down to the low scale @xmath62 . the remaining task is to expand the integral over the shape function in ( [ ff ] ) in a series of forward @xmath0-meson matrix elements of local hqet operators of increasing dimension , multiplied by perturbative coefficient functions",
    "this can be done whenever @xmath71 is large compared with @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath72      \\nonumber\\\\     & \\times &   \\left [ 1 + \\frac{\\eta(\\eta-1)}{2}\\ ,      \\frac{(-\\lambda_1)}{3\\delta^2 } + \\dots \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 \\ln\\frac{m_b\\delta}{\\mu_i^2 }      + 2h^2(\\eta ) + 3h(\\eta ) - 2h'(\\eta ) + 7 - \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3 } \\",

    "even though it is parametrically larger than ordinary power corrections of order @xmath75 , the `` enhanced '' @xmath76 correction in ( [ rate2 ] ) remains small in the region of `` perturbative '' values of @xmath20 , where the msope can be trusted .",
    "the net effect amounts to a reduction of the decay rate by less than 5% .    the rate in ( [ rate2 ] )",
    "is formally independent of the three matching scales , at which we switch from qcd to scet ( @xmath33 ) , from scet to hqet ( @xmath34 ) , and finally at which the shape - function integral is expanded in a series of local operators ( @xmath77 ) . in practice ,",
    "a residual scale dependence arises because we have truncated the perturbative expansion .",
    "varying the three matching scales about their default values provides some information about unknown higher - order terms . in the limit where the intermediate and low matching scales @xmath34 and @xmath77 are set equal to the hard matching scale @xmath33 , our result reduces to the conventional formula used in previous analyses of the @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "however , this choice can not be justified on physical grounds .    in ( [ rate2 ] ) we have accomplished a complete resummation of ( parametrically ) large logarithms at next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic order in rg - improved perturbation theory , which is necessary in order to calculate the decay rate with @xmath78 accuracy .",
    "specifically , it means that terms of the form @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 are correctly resummed to all orders in perturbation theory . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a complete resummation at next - to - next - to - leading order has never been achieved before .",
    "finally , we stress that the various next - to - leading order terms in the expression for the decay rate should be consistently expanded to order @xmath82 before applying our results to phenomenology .    up to this point",
    ", the @xmath11-quark mass @xmath4 entering the formula ( [ rate2 ] ) for the decay rate is defined in the on - shell scheme .",
    "while this is most convenient for performing calculations using heavy - quark expansions , it is well known that hqet parameters defined in the pole scheme suffer from infra - red renormalon ambiguities .",
    "it is necessary to replace them in favor of some physical , short - distance parameters . for our purposes ,",
    "the `` shape - function scheme '' provides for a particularly suitable definition of the heavy - quark mass @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a good estimate of a shape - function integral can be obtained using the mean - value theorem , replacing @xmath83 with @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the running shape - function mass , which depends on a hard cutoff @xmath20 in addition to the renormalization scale @xmath77 . the quantity @xmath20 in the shape - function scheme is defined by the implicit equation @xmath86 .",
    "the shape - function scheme provides a physical definition of @xmath4 , which can be related to any other short - distance definition using perturbation theory .",
    "based on various sources of phenomenological information including @xmath87 spectroscopy and moments of inclusive @xmath0-meson decay spectra , the value of the shape - function mass at a reference scale @xmath88gev has been determined as @xmath89gev @xcite .",
    "the results discussed so far provide a complete description of the @xmath1 decay rate at leading order in the @xmath90 expansion , where the two - step matching qcd@xmath91scet@xmath91hqet is well understood .",
    "for practical applications , however , it is necessary to include corrections arising at higher orders in the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "most important are `` kinematic '' power corrections of order @xmath92 , which are not associated with new hadronic parameters . unlike the non - perturbative corrections , these effects appear already at first order in @xmath93 , and they are numerically dominant in the region where @xmath94 . technically ,",
    "the kinematic power corrections correspond to subleading jet functions arising in the matching of qcd onto higher - dimensional scet operators , as well as subleading shape functions arising in the matching of scet onto hqet operators .",
    "the corresponding terms are known in fixed - order perturbation theory , without scale separation and rg resummation @xcite . to perform",
    "a complete rg analysis of even the first - order terms in @xmath93 is beyond the scope of our discussion . since for typical values of @xmath18",
    "the power corrections only account for about 15% of the @xmath1 decay rate , an approximate treatment suffices at the present level of precision .",
    "details of how these corrections are implemented can be found in ref .",
    "the contributions from the three different short - distance scales entering the central result ( [ rate2 ] ) and the associated theoretical uncertainties can be disentangled by taking ratios of decay rates .",
    "some ratios probe truly short - distance physics ( i.e. , physics above the scale @xmath31 ) and so remain unaffected by the new theoretical results presented above . for some other ratios , the short - distance physics",

    "these complications would be absent if it were possible to measure the fully inclusive rate .",
    "it is convenient to define a function @xmath99 as the ratio of the @xmath1 decay rate with a cut @xmath18 divided by the total rate , @xmath100 because of a logarithmic soft - photon divergence for very low energy , it is conventional @xcite to define the `` total '' inclusive rate as the rate with a very low cutoff @xmath101 .",
    "the denominator in the expression for @xmath99 can be evaluated using the standard ope , which corresponds to setting all three matching scales equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the numerator is given by our expression in ( [ rate2 ] ) , supplemented by power corrections .",
    "another important example of a ratio that is largely insensitive to the hard matching contributions is the average photon energy @xmath102 , which has been proposed as a good way to measure the @xmath11-quark mass @xcite .",
    "the impact of shape - function effects on the theoretical prediction for this quantity has been investigated and was found to be significant @xcite . here",
    "we study the average photon energy in the msope region , where a model - independent prediction can be obtained .",
    "it is structurally different from the one found using the conventional ope in the sense that contributions associated with different scales are disentangled from each other .",
    "we stress that the hard scale @xmath31 affects the average photon energy only via second - order power corrections .",
    "this shows that it is not appropriate to compute the quantity @xmath102 using a simple heavy - quark expansion at the scale @xmath4 , which is however done in the conventional approach @xcite .",
    "this observation is important , because information about moments of the @xmath1 photon spectrum is sometimes used in global fits to determine the ckm matrix element @xmath103 . keeping only the leading power corrections , which is a very good approximation",

    "the result may be compared with the values @xmath119 and @xmath120 obtained from two studies of shape - function models @xcite , in which perturbative uncertainties have been ignored .",
    "we obtain a significantly smaller central value with a much larger uncertainty .",
    "the last quantity we wish to explore is the average photon energy .",
    "as mentioned above , this observable is very sensitive to the interplay of physics at the intermediate and low scales .",
    "the study of uncertainties due to parameter variations exhibits that the prime sensitivity is to the @xmath11-quark mass , which is expected , since @xmath121 to leading order .",

    "our prediction is in excellent agreement with the belle result in ( [ belle ] ) .",
    "this finding provides support to the value of the @xmath11-quark mass in the shape - function scheme extracted in ref .",
    "we stress , however , that the large perturbative uncertainties in the formula for @xmath102 impose significant limitations on the precision with which @xmath4 can be extracted from a measurement of the average photon energy .",
    "our estimate above implies a perturbative uncertainty of @xmath129={}_{-100}^{+140}$]mev .",

    "this is the region of interest to experiments at the @xmath0 factories .",
    "the first condition ( @xmath94 ) ensures that a theoretical treatment without shape functions can be applied .",
    "however , the second condition ( @xmath131 ) means that this treatment is _ not _ a conventional heavy - quark expansion in powers of @xmath132 and @xmath19 .",
    "instead , we have shown that three distinct short - distance scales are relevant in this region .",
    "they are the hard scale @xmath4 , the hard - collinear ( or jet ) scale @xmath5 , and the low scale @xmath20 .",
    "to separate the contributions associated with these scales requires a multi - scale operator product expansion ( msope ) .",
    "our approach allows us to study analytically the transition from the shape - function region , where @xmath133 , into the msope region , where @xmath134 , into the region @xmath135 , where a conventional heavy - quark expansion applies .",
    "this is a significant improvement over previous work .",
    "for instance , it has sometimes been argued that exactly where the transition to a conventional heavy - quark expansion occurs is an empirical question , which can not be answered theoretically .",
    "our formalism provides a precise , quantitative answer to this question .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 with a realistic cut on the photon energy , one is _ not _ in a situation where a short - distance expansion at the scale @xmath4 can be justified .",
    "the analysis makes it evident that the precision that can be achieved in the prediction of the @xmath1 branching ratio is , ultimately , determined by how well perturbative and non - perturbative corrections can be controlled at the lowest relevant scale @xmath20 , which in practice is of order 1gev .",
    "consequently , we estimate much larger theoretical uncertainties than previous authors . these uncertainties are dominated by yet unknown higher - order perturbative effects .",
    "non - perturbative , hadronic effects at the scale @xmath20 appear to be small and under control .",
    "this is not the first time in the history of @xmath1 calculations that issues of scale setting have changed the prediction and error estimate for the branching ratio ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our case , however , the change in perspective about the theory of @xmath1 decay is more profound , as it imposes limitations on the very validity of a short - distance treatment .",
    "if the short - distance expansion at the scale @xmath20 fails , then the rate _ can not _ be calculated without resource to non - perturbative shape functions , which introduces an irreducible amount of model dependence . in practice , while @xmath7gev ( for @xmath8gev ) is probably sufficiently large to trust a short - distance analysis , it would be unreasonable to expect that yet unknown higher - order effects should be less important than in the case of other low - scale applications of qcd .",
    "obtaining a precise prediction for the @xmath1 decay rate in the standard model is an important target of heavy - flavor theory .",
    "the present work shows that the ongoing effort to calculate the dominant parts of the next - to - next - to - leading corrections in the conventional heavy - quark expansion is only part of what is needed to achieve this goal .",
    "equally important will be to compute the dominant higher - order corrections proportional to @xmath22 and @xmath136 , and to perform a renormalization - group analysis of the leading kinematic power corrections of order @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , our error analysis suggests that these effects are potentially more important that the hard matching corrections at the scale @xmath4 .    _",
