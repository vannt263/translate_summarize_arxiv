    "in this paper , we consider the martin compactification of a complete non - compact surface @xmath4 with negative curvature .",
    "in particular , we investigate positive eigenfunctions with eigenvalue one of the laplace operator @xmath2 of @xmath4 and prove a certain uniqueness result .",
    "the problem arises in our study of deformations of three - dimensional collapsed gradient steady ricci solitons @xcite .    a classical result due to g. herglotz @xcite says that any positive harmonic function @xmath5 on the unit disk @xmath6 has an integral representation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the poisson kernel of @xmath6 and @xmath9 is a finite positive borel measure .",
    "a fundamental generalization of the above formula to bounded domains in @xmath10 was given by r. martin in @xcite .",
    "he showed that an analogue of the above representation formula holds in complete generality , where the integral is taken over an ideal boundary , called the martin boundary , defined in terms of the limiting behavior of a green s function .",
    "later , martin s results were extended to the second order elliptic differential operators on complete riemannian manifolds , see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .    on a riemannian manifold of non - positive curvature ,",
    "there is a well - known compactification by attaching its geometric boundary that is determined by the asymptotic behavior of geodesics at infinity , see @xcite .",
    "a celebrated result by m. anderson and r. schoen @xcite states that on a negatively curved manifold @xmath11 , its martin boundary with respect to the laplace operator is homeomorphic to its geometric boundary , provided the sectional curvature is pinched between two negative constants .",
    "thus the martin compactification of such a manifold associated to the laplace operator coincides with its geometric compactification .",
    "anderson - schoen s result has been generalized by a. ancona in @xcite to weakly coercive elliptic operators @xmath12 using different techniques . in @xcite , w. ballmann constructed examples of non - positively curved manifolds containing flats of dimension @xmath13 such that the martin compactification agrees with the geometric compactification .",

    "we are especially interested in characterizing non - negative functions @xmath17 on @xmath1 such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 note that the laplace operator of @xmath4 is given by @xmath20 hence such a function @xmath21 is in fact an eigenfunction of @xmath2 with eigenvalue one , @xmath22 this problem of characterizing non - negative solutions of ( [ eqn : pdew ] ) arises in our study of the infinitesimal rigidity of deformations of the collapsed 3d cigar soliton @xmath23 , the product of hamilton s cigar soliton @xmath24 and the real line @xmath25 with the product metrics , as follows : consider any one - parameter family of complete three - dimensional gradient steady ricci solitons @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , with @xmath28 being the 3d cigar soliton @xmath29 , satisfying the following two conditions :    * the metric @xmath30 admits a non - trivial killing vector field for all @xmath31 , * the scalar curvature @xmath32 of @xmath30 attains its maximum at some point on @xmath33 for each @xmath31 .",
    "then , the first variation of the sectional curvatures of @xmath26 produces a certain non - negative function @xmath17 on @xmath1 satisfying ( [ eqn : pdew ] ) .",
    "the infinitesimal rigidity of the deformation essentially reduces to proving the uniqueness of such nonnegative eigenfunctions up to a positive constant multiple ; see @xcite for the details . this led us to consider the martin compactification of @xmath4 associated with the operator @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that the gauss curvature of @xmath4 is negative , bounded from below , but approaches zero along some paths to infinity .",
