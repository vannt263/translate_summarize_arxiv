    "then , the extrinsic curvature is given by k^_=\\ { 2a+a^2 + } , k^_= , where the hats are used to denote that we are working in an orthonormal basis ; the dot means a derivative with respect to the proper time @xmath27 on the shell , and a prime stands for a derivative with respect to @xmath28 . with these definitions we can write down the lanczos equations @xcite , which relate the extrinsic curvature at both sides of the one dimensional surface with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath29 on it -[k_ij]+[k]g_ij=8s_ij . here",

    "the parameter @xmath51 can be interpreted as the squared velocity of sound ( then @xmath52 ) ; however , this is not necessarily the case here , because of the exoticism of the matter at the shell .",

    "the results corresponding to the chan  mann wormhole are qualitatively similar , when the charge is very close to the critical one , to those of the low mass btz geometry .",
    "the main difference is that the behavior does not change for large values of the mass as in the btz case .",
    "mann metric is characterized by the parameter @xmath9 ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "decreasing values of @xmath9 shift the regions of stability to smaller adimensionalized throat radius , and to higher positive values of the parameter @xmath80 when the charge is lower than the critical one .",
    "the schmidt ",
    "singleton wormhole spacetime , which has no charge and admits the simplest treatment , is stable only when @xmath110 .",
