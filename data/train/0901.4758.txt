    "the competition between the short time scale physics associated with the fugacity of the warps and the long range interaction between them is precisely the reason for the observed phase transition .",
    "in reference [ 1 ] we have argued that the long wavelength theory of a model for the pseudogap state for the cuprate superconductors is the ashkin - teller model , the quantum version of this model with dissipation is in the universality class of dissipative quantum @xmath187 model .",
    "the marginal fermi liquid @xcite properties of the optimally doped system originate from the fluctuation spectrum of the local quantum critical point . in this model",
    "the phase variable @xmath14 represents the possible current loop order within a given unit cell and the four fold anisotropy restricts it to four values representing states that break time reversal and one of two possible reflection symmetries .",
    "the origin of the dissipation in this system is due to the coupling of the order parameter , which corresponds to the coherent part of the current operator , to the incoherent part of the current operator which correspond to fermions near the fermi surface . for long - wavelength fluctuations",
    "such a coupling leads to ohmic dissipation of the form in eqn.[diss ] , while term of the form in eqn.[densdiss2](see below ) is not generated .",
    "detailed derivation of the long wavelength theory will be provided in a later publication .",
    "the classical ashkin teller model is defined in terms of two ising degrees of freedom per unit cell . if we define @xmath199 and @xmath200 as ising variables taking @xmath201 values to parameterize the currents along the the @xmath7 and @xmath8 direction , the four resulting states in each unit - cell ( see fig.[fig : domain ] ) form the basis of the low energy sector of the long wavelength theory .     and @xmath8 directions . ]",
    "the hamiltonian of the classical ashkin teller model is @xcite    @xmath202\\ ] ]    for @xmath203 the model reduces to two decoupled ising models which is known to undergo a gaussian phase transition @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been extended to map out the entire phase diagram by observing that @xmath204 is a marginal operator in this theory @xcite . for @xmath205",
    "the system undergoes a gaussian phase transition form a ferromagnetically ordered state to a paramagnetic state with continuously varying exponents . quite remarkable",
    ", for @xmath206 , the specific heat exponent @xmath122 is negative .",
    "the ashkin teller model explains why no singularity is observed in specific heat measurements at the pseudogap temperature accompanying the breaking of time reversal symmetry .",
    "defining @xmath207 and @xmath208 we can rewrite the hamiltonian as    @xmath209\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 s take values @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",

    "the discrete nature of the underlying degrees of freedom of the ashkin teller model enforce an ising type order at low temperatures .",
    "on increasing temperature , it undergoes a gaussian transition into a state which can be described by proliferation of vortices .",
    "it is a unique property of four fold anisotropy that the disordering , which occurs via proliferation of vortices , and ordering , which is enforced by a diverging anisotropy field , happen at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "we now analyze the effect of such an anisotropy field on the local quantum critical point .",
    "to do so we introduce the term @xmath214 in the hamiltonian .",
    "to handle such a term in the action we employ the following approximation scheme    @xmath215    where @xmath216 is an integer field that lives at each site and @xmath217 . for large values of @xmath218",
    "the approximation is reliable as the sum will be dominated by the terms with @xmath219 .",
    "eq.[anis ] introduces two new terms in the action , one linear in the phase and the other independent of it .",
    "we can proceed as before in integrating out the phase degrees of freedom to get a new action which is of the form    @xmath220    given that the coupling between the integer field @xmath221 and the phase variable is linear we can follow a self consistent procedure to calculate its effect on the dissipative fixed point . in this context",
    "it is useful to recall that in the absence of dissipation , the disordered side is characterized by the anisotropy field going to zero , i.e. being marginally irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of anisotropy the dissipative transition leads to a state which is characterized by the proliferation of warps .",
    "in other words , the most singular part of the action is the interaction between warps in time .",
    "since the action for the integer field , @xmath221 , is quadratic , the cumulant expansion implies that the a new term in the action for warps appears of the form    @xmath222    the correlation is obtained from a self consistent solution of the coupled equations shown diagrammatically represented in fig.[fig : greensfn ] .     and the thick dashed lines represent @xmath223 , while the thin full and dashed lines represent the same propagators computed in the absence of the linear coupling with the warps . ]",
    "a quadratic equation is obtained for each of the propagators .",
    "since we are looking at the effect of the anisotropy on the effective action for the warps , we can solve these equations to obtain the most singular contribution to the propagator in eqn.[aniscoup ] . defining @xmath224 and @xmath225 ,",
    "symbolically the equation satisfied by @xmath226 can be written as    @xmath227    where @xmath228 and @xmath229 are the corresponding propagators evaluated in the absence of the linear coupling and @xmath230 . at the quantum critical point ,",
    "the most singular contribution for the warps is logarithmic in frequency , while the action for the integer fields is not singular .",
    "this is again due to the fact that the integer fields interact via colomb kernel in three dimensions .",
    "thus the most singular part of the solution is of the form @xmath231^{-1}$ ] . substituting in eqn.[aniscoup ] ,",
    "the effect of the anisotropy is to introduce a term in the action of the form    @xmath232^{-1 } \\rho_{w}\\left(\\textbf{k},\\omega\\right)\\rho_{w}\\left(-\\textbf{k},-\\omega\\right).\\ ] ]    thus all anisotropy does is to modify the coupling constants but the local quantum criticality remains and the form of the correlations at the critical point are still local in space and power law in time .",
    "in addition to the bosonic modes associated with the order parameter , the low energy sector of the cuprates has fermionic degrees of freedom associated with electron near the fermi surface .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the order parameter correspond to flipping between states of the ashkin - teller model . from the mapping above of the ashkin teller model to an xy model with four fold anisotropy , we note that a flip operator is the quenched angular momentum operator . for the cuprates",
    ", the analogous operator can be shown to correspond to the curl of the fermionic current @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the fermionic degrees of freedom and the bosonic critical modes is of the form    @xmath233    where @xmath234 is an operator which flips the state of the ashkin teller model ( analogous to @xmath235 in the continuous limit ) and @xmath236 is the fermionic current .",
    "integrating out fermions leads to an ohmic dissipative term in the action for the order parameter .",
    "the reason is that the current current correlation is the conductivity which goes as @xmath237 . unlike josephson junction arrays",
    ", the origin of dissipation in cuprates is the presence of both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in the low energy long - wavelength theory .",
    "the form of dissipation considered so far is physically motivated to reproduce a term linear in the gradient of the phase variable in its equation of motion . furthermore it can also be understood as arising from dissipation via resistors connecting the islands on which the phase degrees of freedom live . in principle",
    "one can also study the effect of other forms of dissipation that are allowed by symmetry .",
    "in particular , we can introduce a term which leads to suppression of density in each grain instead of the phase difference between nearest neighbor grains as in eqn.[diss ] .",
    "@xmath238    to understand the effect of such a term on the dissipation driven critical point we consider the effect of integrating out frequency shells as before .",
    "we find that the coupling constant @xmath239 scales to zero since it has a dimension of @xmath240 .",
    "in other words such a form of dissipation is irrelevant near the local quantum critical point , while for a @xmath67 critical point such a term is marginal .    a dissipative mechanism where the external bath directly couples to the phase variable leads to an action of the form    @xmath241    the coupling @xmath242 is marginal at the local quantum critical point .",
    "a study of the critical properties showed the existence of a line of fixed points controlling the transition from the superconducting to the insulating state @xcite , but the approximation made were called into question @xcite .",
    "a weak coupling study of the model has been reported @xcite and a strong coupling analysis will be the subject of future investigation",
    "with the identification of the correct degrees of freedom we have been able to access the dissipation driven critical point that has been previously shown to exist within a perturbative analysis .",
    "furthermore , fourfold anisotropy does not alter the local criticality obtained at this quantum critical point .",
    "thus the dissipative @xmath134 model defines a new universality class .",
    "classical models which undergo a gaussian phase transition from an ordered to a disordered phase will belong to this universality class provided their quantum generalization include ohmic dissipation . in this context",
    "we can look at the physics of six and eight vertex models .",
    "the phase diagram of the six vertex model has two ordered phases , the orbital ferromagnet and the orbital antiferromagnet , and a power law phase .",
    "the high temperature phase is the power law phase and at low temperatures undergoes a transition to one of the two ordered phases .",
    "it is known that there exists an essential singularity at the phase transition and the physics is similar to the @xmath134 model except that is inverted .",
    "the high temperature phase is power law correlated while the low temperature phase has finite correlations @xcite . unlike the dissipative xy model considered here , the inverted character of the phase transition , while allowing for a phase transition without a singularity in specific heat @xcite , is unlikely to belong to the universality class of local criticality .",
    "however , the low temperature physics of this model including quantum generalization allowing for sources and sink is yet to be analyzed .",
    "the classical eight vertex model on the other hand has in its parameter space a high temperature disordered phase which can undergo a kt transition to an ordered phase @xcite .",
    "such models also share the feature that the specific heat is nonsingular at the phase transition",
    ". quantum generalization of this model with dissipation have not been studied .",
    "in particular it is not clear which operators in the classical theory are equivalent to the warps defined in the continuum . a detailed analysis of the conditions for classical eight vertex models to exhibit local criticality is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "local quantum criticality closely related to the form proposed for the cuprates @xcite and derived here has also been used to fit the spectral function near the quantum - critical point of a heavy - fermion @xcite measured by neutron scattering .",
    "some theoretical calculations @xcite emphasizing the deconstruction of the single impurity kondo effect near the quantum critical point @xcite have been performed . a general point based on",
    "the present work appears worth making : local quantum criticality requires showing that near the quantum - critical point , there must be variables in terms of which the action for low energies is separable exactly into orthogonal parts which interact only in space without retardation in time , and those which are power law in time but interact only locally in space .",
    "it appears to us that only dissipation driven quantum critical points can have this property . at this point",
    ", it does not appear clear to us in terms of which variables , the general action of the heavy fermion problem with dissipation , local kondo interactions , interaction between local moments , magnetic order with attendant deconstruction of the kondo effect , etc .",
    ", may be cast into the simple structure due to which we have been able to solve the problems addressed in this paper .",
    "in this paper we have provided a detailed analysis of the dissipation driven phase transition in the quantum 2d xy model .",
    "there exists a critical point in the phase diagram where the correlation are shown to be local in space and power law in time .",
    "this is a new paradigm in critical phenomena which does not appear in the universality classes of classical dynamical critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the quantum disordering due to the proliferation of a new of class of topological defects , the warps , which interact logarithmically in time but local in space allows such criticality .",
