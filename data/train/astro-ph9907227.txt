    "the study of gravitational lenses has become a powerful tool to address several distinct cosmological and astrophysical questions .",
    "these include the distribution of dark matter in galaxies ( keeton et al .",
    "@xcite ) , studying dust extinction at redshift @xmath3 ( nadeau et al .  @xcite ; jean & surdej @xcite ) , and determining the hubble parameter @xmath4 from measurements of light travel time delay between different lines of sight ( refsdal @xcite ) .",
    "the appeal of this method lies in its complete independence of the traditional cosmic distance ladder , yielding distances for high - redshift objects in a single leap .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath4 estimation are mainly limited by ambiguities in modelling the deflector mass distribution , since all relevant _ measurement _ errors can be reduced to insignificance . while ` simple ' lenses such as double qsos do not strongly constrain the deflector model , multiple systems such as quadruply imaged qsos provide many additional constraints , allowing e.g.  to independently test the assumed mass distribution models ( cf .",
    "saha & williams @xcite ) . a problem with quadruple systems , however , can be excessive symmetry leading to time delays which are short compared to intrinsic radio and optical variability timescales , as in the famous ` einstein cross ' 2237@xmath5030 or in the ` clover leaf ' h  1413@xmath5117 .",
    "in this paper we present the discovery of the new multiple qso he  0230@xmath02130 .",
    "the object was originally identified as a high - probability qso candidate in the course of the hamburg / eso survey ( wisotzki et al .",
    "@xcite ) and subsequently observed as part of a large imaging search for lensed qsos .",

    "imaging data were obtained at the ctio 1.5 m on 13 november 1998 , in johnson @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and cousins @xmath14 . in each band , three images were taken of 5min exposure time each .",

    "although we had little doubt about its qso nature , confirmation was clearly needed .",
    "we obtained a first low - resolution spectrum on 23 november 1998 with the eso / danish 1.5 m telescope equipped with dfosc .",
    "a slit of @xmath25 positioned east - west gave a spectral resolution of @xmath26  fwhm .",
    "the rather poor seeing of @xmath27 inhibited all attempts to separate different components ; and the spectrum , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spcdanish ] , represents more or less the superposition of all components .",
    "it shows a typical qso with @xmath28 , as measured from the centroid of the mgii emission line .",
    "an attempt to obtain individual spectra of different components was made at the eso 3.5 m ntt on 10 december 1998 , using the red arm of emmi with grism # 3 and a @xmath16 slit , at 8  resolution .",
    "only one spectrum could be taken , with the slit oriented north - south crossing a2 and b. at a seeing of @xmath29 , the components were well separated , showing two qso spectra at the same redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , the spectrum of b suffers from substantial slit losses : while the flux ratio a2/b is 2.3 in the red , in good agreement with the psf photometry described below , it increases to @xmath30 at the blue end around 4000 . to correct for these losses ,",
    "the quotient spectrum was fitted with a 5th - order polynomial , and the spectrum of b was multiplied by the fit , thereby adjusting both spectra to the same global level of relative fluxes .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",

    "to decompose the complex configuration into discrete sources , we employed the daophot  ii software package as implemented within eso - midas . for the optical images ,",
    "a numerical composite psf was built for each image using three bright stars at @xmath31 distance to the qso . in the @xmath32 band data no bright psf star was available within the small field of view , and",
    "a purely analytical psf was estimated from the only two isolated stars in the field .",
    "the qso was then modelled by the superposition of five point sources , with positions and psf scaling factors simultaneously optimised ( routine allstar ) .",
    "fitting five components gave always a significantly better fit , in terms of residual @xmath33 , than with four , even in the @xmath12 band image where c and d are both very faint .",
    "the fitting results are collected in tables [ tab : pos ] and [ tab : phot ] .",
    "positions are measured relative to a1 , which was arbitrarily taken as reference point .    for components a1 , a2 , and b , the positions measured in the four _ brik _ images are very consistent , and the scatter between the photometric bands reflects the measurement error . for c and d ,",
    "image positions are consistent only between @xmath14 and @xmath32 ; at shorter wavelengths , the fitted centroids approach each other as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pos ] .",
    "this could be related to different intrinsic colours of the objects , but could also be an artefact of low s / n and the somewhat poorer seeing in the shorter wavelength data .",
    "differential psf photometry of the qso components relative to a1 was available from the allstar analysis ( tab .",
    "[ tab : phot ] ) .",
    "flux calibration was established separately using simple aperture photometry ( aperture diameter was @xmath34 for _ bri _ and @xmath35 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "standard stars from the ru149 field ( landolt @xcite ) served to obtain colour terms and photometric zeropoints in the optical , while sj9106 ( persson et al .",
    "@xcite ) was used for the nir photometry .",
    "the total magnitudes thus measured are listed in the first line of table [ tab : phot ] , with uncertainty estimates as given in the daophot output .",
    "we have also determined aperture _ bri _ magnitudes for 14 nearby stars in the field that may be useful to serve as reference stars in future monitoring .",
    "a list with these measurements is available on request .",
    "the relative photometry confirms that a1 , a2 , and b have very similar optical - nir colours although b appears slightly redder than a1 and a2 .",
    "c and d are much redder , on the other hand , so neither can correspond to a single unobscured fourth qso image .",
    "because of the apparent positional shift between the bands , we computed a second model with fixed positions imposed from the @xmath14 band image , fitting only the psf scaling factors .",
    "the resulting colours are slightly bluer for components b and c , and even much redder for d. however , inspection of the psf - subtracted images indicated that the fit quality of these restricted models was much poorer , leaving residuals significant on the 23@xmath36 level .",
