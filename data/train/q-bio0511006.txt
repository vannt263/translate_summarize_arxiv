    "this paper is devoted to introducing a simple class of capsomer models , and demonstrating that newtonian dynamics of these models exhibit spontaneous assembly into 60-unit icosahedral capsids , depending upon conditions ( i.e. , particle concentration and force field parameters ) .",
    "we believe it is the first report of statistically meaningful simulations of capsid assembly that follow from unbiased dynamics obeying time - reversal symmetry and detailed balance .",
    "the formation of viral capsids is a marvel of natural engineering and design .",
    "a large number ( from 60 to thousands ) of protein subunits assemble into complete , reproducible structures under a variety of conditions while avoiding kinetic and thermodynamic traps .",
    "understanding the features of capsid components that enable such robust assembly could be important for the development of synthetic supra - nano assemblies .",
    "in addition , this knowledge is essential for the development of anti - viral drugs that inhibit capsid assembly or disassembly and could focus efforts to direct the making of highly specific drug delivery vehicles .",
    "these goals necessitate the ability to manipulate when and where capsids assemble and disassemble .",
    "thus , we seek to determine what externally or internally controlled factors promote or alleviate dynamic frustration in the capsid assembly process . although many viruses assemble with the aid of nucleic acids and scaffolding proteins , the first step toward this objective is to understand the inherent ability of subunit - subunit interactions to direct spontaneous assembly .",
    "the equilibrium properties of viral capsids have been the subject of insightful theoretical investigations ( e.g refs . ) and the assembly process has been investigated in a number of experiments ( e.g. refs . ) , yet this process is still poorly understood for many viruses ( e.g. ref . ) .",
    "assembly is difficult to analyze experimentally because most intermediates are transient . with single molecule techniques",
    ", it is now possible to directly probe intermediate structures .",
    "each intermediate , however , is a member of a large ensemble of structures and pathways that comprise the overall assembly process .",
    "formation of an intermediate requires collective binding events that are regulated by a tightly balanced competition of forces between individual subunits .",
    "it is difficult , with experiments alone , to parse these interactions for the factors that are critical to the assembly process .",
    "thus , it is useful to have complementary computational models in which the effects of different interactions can be isolated and monitored .    studying assembly through computation is challenging because short range subunit - subunit properties regulate the formation of overall structure . binding and unbinding",
    "rates of individual subunits are orders of magnitude faster than the overall assembly times .",
    "furthermore , these rates are controlled by interactions defined on atomic lengths , which are three orders of magnitude smaller than typical capsid sizes .",
    "prior computational studies provide valuable insights that we build upon ; in particular , zlotnick pioneered a rate - equation description of assembly @xcite and berger and co - workers developed particle based methods @xcite .",
    "earlier studies , although an important foundation for our work , are limited in that they have been based upon pre - conceived pathways of assembly @xcite , or dynamics that did not obey detailed balance @xcite , or dynamics that was anecdotal @xcite .",
    "these approaches can be useful and physical justifications for them can be made .",
    "nevertheless , we seek to avoid these limitations in order to understand the nature of possible kinetic traps and the extent of ensembles of successful assembly events . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present our class of models for capsid subunits .",
    "we evaluate the thermodynamic properties of this model in section [ sec : thermo ] , and then discuss the results of dynamical simulations in section [ sec : results ] . by simulating assembly for many different values of system parameters , we vary the strength of the forces that either drive or thwart assembly .",
    "we identify regions of parameter space in which two forms of kinetic traps prevail and we elucidate processes by which dynamic frustration is avoided in other regions of parameter space .",
    "* capsomers . * capsid proteins typically have several hundred residues that fold into well defined shapes with specific interactions that lead to attractions between complementary sides of nearby subunits .",
    "we imagine that by integrating over degrees of freedom , such as atomic coordinates , as capsid proteins fluctuate about their native states , one can arrive at a model in which subunits have excluded volume and asymmetric pairwise bonding interactions between complementary sides .",
    "several models have been presented in which asymmetric subunits , the capsomers , are represented by conglomerates of spherically symmetric particles with varying interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "these approaches can describe complex excluded volume shapes .",
    "the approach we take here , however , is simpler , and motivated by the modeling described in ref . .",
    "specifically , we use only a single spherical excluded volume per capsomer , and we use internal bond vectors to capture the effects of protein shape and complementarity .",
    "our model capsomers are of three types : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which contain three , four and five internal capsomer bond vectors , respectively .",
    "these bond vectors , @xmath3 , are pictured in figure 1 .",
    "the index @xmath4 goes from 1 to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 for the @xmath0 model , @xmath7 for the @xmath1 model , and so forth , and the index @xmath8 goes from 1 to @xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the number of capsomers in the system .",
    "the vector @xmath10 is the position of interaction site @xmath4 on capsomer @xmath8 , where @xmath11 is the center of capsomer @xmath8 .",
    "all bond vectors have the same magnitude , @xmath12 . within a capsomer frame of reference ,",
    "the bond vectors are fixed rigidly .",
    "they move only because the capsomer translates and rotates .",
    "this is not to say that proteins do not fluctuate .",
    "those fluctuations , we imagine , have been averaged over , i.e. , integrated out of the model at the level we consider .",
    "the net potential energy of interaction among @xmath9 capsomers , @xmath13 , is taken to be pair - decomposable ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 depends upon the bond vectors and centers of capsomers @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "the particular form for this pair potential depends upon which of the three models , @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 is under consideration . in each case , however , the potential is constructed so that the lowest energy configurations coincide with separate icosohedral clusters of 60 identical capsomers .",
    "these clusters represent capsids with triangulation number ( t ) of one @xcite ; for example , design @xmath2 is consistent with fig .  3 of ref .",
    "our @xmath0 model is similar to the model considered in ref .  .",
    "in each model , bond vectors or interaction sites have complementary counterparts .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 model , interaction site pairs @xmath17 and ( 3,3 ) are the primary complementary pairs .",
    "this means that a favorable potential energy of interaction between a pair @xmath8 and @xmath16 of @xmath0 capsomers has two ways of occuring : 1 ) interaction site 1 on one capsomer overlaps with interaction site 2 on the other capsomer , and the respective bond vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are nearly antiparrallel ; 2 ) interaction site 3 on one capsomer overlaps with interaction site 3 on the other , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nearly antiparrallel .",
    "the only favorable ( i.e. , attractive ) interactions are those associated with primary complementary pairs .    in addition , there are secondary complementary pairs .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 model , with primary complementary pair ( 1,2 ) , there is the secondary pair ( 3,3 ) .",
    "this means that a favorable interaction affected by the primary complementary pair ( 1,2 ) , as described in the previous paragraph , also requires that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nearly coplanar .",
    "similarly , for the primary complementary pair ( 3,3 ) , the secondary pair is either ( 1,2 ) or ( 2,1 ) , meaning that if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are antiparallel , favorable interactions result only if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are nearly co - planar and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are nearly co - planar . of course , because the capsomers are rigid bodies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 being co - planar implies @xmath22 and @xmath23 are co - planar .",
    "the primary and secondary pairs for each of the models are listed in the entrees to table i. local bonding associated with these complementarities and resulting capsid structures are illustrated in figure 2 . in creating these pictures , it is imagined that excluded volume interactions prohibit an interaction site from participating simultaneously in more than one favorable complementary interaction , as is the case for the models we describe .",
    "the dependence of subunit - subunit interactions on the orientation of primary and secondary pairs incorporates the fact that there is a driving force for subunits to align complementary regions to maximize the contact between complementary residues .",
    "capsid curvature in the minimum energy orientation arises from that fact that the angles between bond vectors on a given subunit do not sum to @xmath24 .",

    "[ fig : fc]a . in all cases for which significant assembly occured",
    ", the rate of capsid formation has a roughly sigmoidal shape .",
    "this is a general feature of assembly reactions @xcite that can be understood as follows .",
    "there is an initial lag phase during which capsid intermediates form and progress through the assembly cascade , followed by a rapid growth phase during which these intermediates assemble into complete capsids .",
    "finally , growth slows when monomers ( free subunits ) are depleted and the remaining capsid intermediates are unable to bind with each other .",
    "* final capsid yields are non - monotonic with respect to parameter values , but high yields are possible . * the fraction of subunits in complete capsids , @xmath111 , at the final observation time , @xmath112 , is shown in fig [ fig : fc ] . as @xmath82 , @xmath84 , or @xmath43 increase , intermediates form and grow more rapidly , and thus capsid yields increase to as high as 90% , meaning 15 of the 16 possible capsids were completed .",
    "one of the primary results of this study is that a particle model that does not include details such as heterogeneous nucleation or conformational changes can predict such high capsid yields .",
    "although capsids form more quickly as parameter values are increased , saturation of growth also occurs sooner and capsid yields are non - montonic in each parameter . the sensitivity of capsid yields to parameters seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] is further illustrated with a kinetic phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpd ] .",
    "it demonstrates the coupled dependencies of capsid yields on system parameters .",
    "phases are partitioned according to whether or not there is significant assembly , arbitrarily chosen as @xmath113 .    *",
    "the non - monotronic variation of capsid yields with parameter values arises due to competition between faster capsid growth and kinetic traps . * the initial steps in the assembly cascade result in the formation of fewer bonds than later steps .",
    "if the attractive energy of these bonds is not sufficient to overcome entropic loss the initial steps are uphill on a free energy barrier and hence , are slow .",
    "for parameter sets that are near @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ccc ] ) , where half of the subunits are in complete capsids at equilibrium , the fact that a complete capsid has many more bonds than initial assembly products indicates that the free energy barrier must be many times the thermal energy , @xmath55 .",
    "significant assembly , therefore , does not occur within the finite assembly times we consider until parameter values are much higher than the thermodynamic critical values , and we identify a kinetic lower critical surface ( lcs ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpd ] that bounds the regions with significant assembly from below and to the left .",
    "we consider results at finite observation times because capsid assembly reactions are limited in - vivo by proteolysis times and in - vitro by experimental observation times .",
    "increasing parameters increases the overall rate of capsid growth : higher subunit concentrations , @xmath82 , result in more frequent subunit collisions , higher values of @xmath43 increase the likelihood of binding upon a collision , and higher values of the binding energy , @xmath84 , decrease the rate of the reverse reaction ( subunit unbinding ) .",
    "as parameter values cross the lcs , faster capsid growth leads to significant capsid yields , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] . at even higher values , however , assembly becomes frustrated by two kinetic traps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kt ] ) and we identify an upper critical surface ( ucs ) in fig [ fig : kpd ] to the top and right of the regions in which assembly is kinetically accessable .",
    "because of these kinetic traps , assembly only occurs at subunit - subunit binding energies that are much smaller than values calculated from atomistic potentials in ref . ( see table 1 of that ref . ) . when the binding entropy ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : saddlepoint ] ) is included , however , the resulting free energies are consistent with association constants fit to assembly experiments with hepatitis b capsids in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we present results at three observation times to show how the distance between assembly boundaries expands in all directions as time increases .",
    "the rough boundary of the kinetically accessable region in fig .",
    "[ fig : kpd ] is a measure of the statistical uncertainty that results because each data point describes a single stochastic trajectory .",
    "for trajectories run with different random number seeds at a given set of parameter values , the final number of complete capsids typically did not vary by more than one capsid ; however , variations during the rapid growth phase were larger",
    ".    the kinetic trap depicted in fig [ fig : kt]a arises when progress through initial assembly steps is too rapid , allowing so many capsids to initiate that the pool of monomers and small intermediates becomes depleted before a significant number of capsids are completed . if the remaining partial capsids have non - complementary geometries , further binding can only proceed upon disassembly .",
    "this kinetic trap has been seen in experiments @xcite and predicted theoretically @xcite ; this theory , however , assumes that only monomers can add to partial capsids . as discussed below ,",
    "binding of capsid intermediates is an important mode of assembly and growth does not become frustrated until only intermediates with non - complementary geometries remain .",
    "the kinetic trap just described may not limit assembly _ in vivo _",
    ", where there is a continual supply of new capsid proteins .",
    "subunit bonding in configurations not consistent with a complete capsid ( misbonding ) , however , can lead to a kinetic trap that could frustrate assembly even with an unlimited supply of subunits .",
    "it is not surprising that misbonding occurs more frequently as @xmath43 increases , since there is a smaller driving force toward the minimum energy orientation . as noted by berger and co - workers @xcite ,",
    "though , increasing concentration and binding energy can stabilize subunits with strained bonds , and the higher rate of capsid growth under these conditions can cause misbonded subunits to become trapped in a growing capsid by further addition of subunits . because so many assembly pathways that do not lead to complete capsids are available at these parameter values , the minimum energy configuration , with complete capsids ,",
    "is seldom realized and misformed capsids with spiraling or multi - shelled configurations dominate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt]b . progression from this state to a completed capsid is extremely slow because breakage of many bonds is required",

    "variation of assembly with @xmath82 and @xmath43 ( not shown ) is also similar for each design .",
    "although the capacity to assemble spontaneously is similar for each capsid design , the mechanism of assembly ( near optimal assembly ) for @xmath2 is qualitatively different from that for @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we evaluated assembly mechanisms from simulations by tabulating the size , @xmath116 , of the smallest intermediate involved in each binding or unbinding event ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the net contribution to capsid growth by intermediates of size @xmath116 , @xmath117 , is shown for each capsid design in fig [ fig : nbe ] . while about 33% of subunits assembled as multimers ( @xmath118 ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 capsids , multimer binding accounted for only 6% of all binding for @xmath2 capsids .",
    "the influence of capsid design on mechanism can be understood by examining assembly pathways that are available if growth occurs only through monomer additions , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asspath ] .",
    "once dimerization occurs for @xmath2 , all subsequent monomers can add in such a way that two or more bonds are formed . for parameters values",
    "at which optimal assembly occurs , the formation of a single bond is unfavorable due to entropy loss , but the formation of two or more bonds is favorable .",
    "consequently , the approximate projection of free energy onto cluster size ( see appendix c ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fenergy ] is monotonically decreasing after formation of a dimer .    for architectures @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "it is not possible to construct an assembly path for which monomers form multiple bonds at all cluster sizes greater than two ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : asspath ] ) .",
    "therefore , free energy profiles consistent with these architectures , shown in fig .  [ fig : fenergy ] , have numerous free energy barriers and local minima . at parameter values that are optimal for @xmath2 assembly , progression of @xmath1 and @xmath0 intermediates through the assembly cascade",
    "is stymied by these free energy barriers .",
    "all free energy barriers vanish if parameters are increased until formation of single bonds is favorable . since dimers are stable under these conditions , however , too many capsids initiate and the system becomes mired in the kinetic trap shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kt]a . at moderate parameter values , @xmath1 intermediates that correspond to local minima , such as trimers and hexamers , are metastable .",
    "optimal assembly occurs when these intermediates bind to growing capsids as fast as they are formed .",
    "the first local minimum for @xmath0 capsids does not occur until a cluster size of five ; in this case , optimal assembly occurs at parameter values for which dimerization is only slightly unfavorable and binding events involving dimers are common ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nbe ] ) . as parameter values",
    "are increased beyond optimal assembly conditions , formation of small intermediates becomes more rapid and multimer binding becomes more important for all capsid designs .",
    "note that these free energies compare the relative stability of different multimers .",
    "there are also free energy barriers not shown that are associated with subunit binding or unbinding , which is required to transition between these states .",
    "given the importance of multimer binding to assembly of some capsid designs , it might seem surprising that a rate equation model @xcite that assumes capsids grow only via addition of monomers predicts significant assembly for some parameter values . that particular class of models assumes , however , that monomers bind to intermediates with an average binding free energy , independent of the number of intersubunit contacts formed in a particular configuration . while not explicitly described herein , we have considered a model in which binding free energies were specifically calculated for each capsid intermediate , but the assumption that only monomers could bind to these intermediates was retained .",
    "the assembly dynamics predicted by this model for @xmath2 were consistent with those seen in brownian dynamics simulations , but concentrations of intermediates at local free energy minima built up for @xmath1 and @xmath0 designs , as well as for the design shown in fig 1b of ref .  .",
    "because these intermediates could not bind with each other , the predicted assembly was much less efficient than that predicted by brownian dynamics simulations .",
    "these results suggest that it may be important to consider binding of complexes that are larger than the basic assembly unit when hypothesizing assembly mechanisms from experimental data .    for many viruses ,",
    "the basic assembly units are believed to be small intermediates , such as dimers or trimers .",
    "experimentally observed high concentrations of these species during assembly reactions imply that they form rapidly and are extremely metastable .",
    "this feature could be included in our model by designing a new `` subunit '' that represents the basic assembly unit , or by choosing higher binding energies for certain bond vectors . in this work , where all maximum binding energies are equal",
    ", the importance of multimer binding for @xmath1 and @xmath0 capsids is not a result of the interaction between individual subunits .",
    "rather , the collective interactions of many subunits lead to a free energy profile with numerous local minima , which forces assembly to proceed through binding of intermediates .",
    "although binding of trimers and other multimers is essential to @xmath1 assembly in our simulations , the fraction of subunits that comprise these intermediates is always small compared to the fraction of subunits that are monomers or in completed capsids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pnnt ] ) .",
    "hence , the significance of binding of multimers would be difficult to detect by bulk experiments , such as light scattering or size exclusion chromatography , alone .",
    "the combination of these techniques , though , with selective deletion of residues through mutation @xcite or single molecule experiments may offer insights into the importance of various intermediates in capsid assembly .",
    "* capsids are metastable in infinite dilution and capsid disassembly shows hysteresis . *",
    "since even single virions can sometimes infect cells , viral capsids must be metastable in infinite dilution .",
    "model capdsids also displayed this feature ; for example , significant assembly with @xmath119 did not occur for @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kpd ] ) , but isolated complete capsids simulated without periodic boundary conditions ( to model infinite dilution ) were metastable through @xmath112 for @xmath121 .",
    "this result indicates that the final yield of the capsids at some binding energies will be different for a trajectory that started with mostly complete capsids then for a trajectory that started with random subunit configurations , as shown in fig  [ fig : dissoc ] . in other words",
    ", there would be hysteresis between assembly and disassociation .",
    "hysteresis arises because , as discussed above , there can be large free energy barriers separating the early stages of assembly , where there are few bonds per subunit , and complete capsids , for which each subunit has @xmath5 bonds . therefore , monomers ( or complete capsids ) can be metastable throughout a finite length trajectory above ( or below ) @xmath104 . once the first subunit is removed from a metastable complete capsid , neighboring subunits have fewer bonds and further disassembly",
    "hysteresis in capsid assembly  disassembly has been seen with experiments and theory by zlotnick and co - workers @xcite .",
    "in this work we examined ensembles of assembly trajectories for models that assemble into capsid - like objects .",
    "we demonstrated that computational models can distinguish driving forces and corresponding mechanisms that lead to successful assembly from those that engender dynamic frustration .",
    "therefore , the approach we have outlined might be used to good effect to analyze the dynamics of other assembly models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as well as that for other types of assembly models .",
    "in addition to the calculations presented herein , there are other ways that ensembles of assembly trajectories can be carefully analyzed . for instance",
    ", distributions of capsid formation times could be studied by simulation and potentially estimated with single molecule experiments ; comparisons could shed light on assembly mechanisms , such as the mechanisms for @xmath1 and @xmath2 assembly illustrated in this work .",
    "trajectories generated by the approach described in this work can be a starting point for performing importance sampling in trajectory space @xcite , which would facilitate statistical analysis of ensembles of assembly pathways .",
    "rechtsman and co - workers describe an `` inverse statistical mechanical - methodology '' that allows importance sampling in model space to design potentials that direct assembly into a particular ground state @xcite . the ability to generate ensembles of dynamical trajectories invites a related strategy , in which one seeks to optimize a function of entire assembly paths , such as capsid assembly times or identities of key intermediates .",
    "this approach would involve importance sampling steps in trajectory space , such as shooting moves @xcite , as well as sampling steps in model space .",
    "understanding model features that lead to specific assembly behavior could guide and interpret experiments that involve mutated capsid proteins .",
