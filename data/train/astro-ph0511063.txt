    "observations made with the egret ( energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ) gamma - ray detector onboard the cgro ( compton gamma ray observatory ) spacecraft resulted in the identification of nearly 70 gamma - ray emitting agns @xcite , with more recent studies increasing the number of egret sources with at least one plausible agn association by @xmath3 ( @xcite , ) .",
    "these are predominantly radio - loud agns , which suggests a strong connection between the gamma - ray emission and the radio emission .",
    "recent vlbi observations have revealed several interesting features of the parsec - scale structures in gamma - ray loud agns . @xcite",
    "completed multi - epoch vlba ( very long baseline array ) observations of 42 gamma - ray loud agns at 22.2 and 43.2ghz , and occasionally 8.4 and 15.4ghz . from these they found that 10 gamma - ray flares in eight objects fall within 1@xmath4 uncertainties of extrapolated epoch of zero separation from the core of a superluminal radio component .",
    "in addition they compared their observations with variability of polarized radio flux and gamma - ray flares , and suggest that gamma - ray emission occurs in the superluminal radio components @xcite . the fact that the gamma - ray flare occurs close to the time of the maximum polarized radio flux density and after the mm - wavelength radio flare favors a model in which the gamma - ray emission is produced by inverse compton scattering by the electrons in the parsec - scale jet rather than closer to the central engine .",
    "gamma - ray emission from inverse compton scattering ( e.g. @xcite ) requires a smaller jet viewing angle and higher doppler factor because the emission should be concentrated in the jet direction .",
    "@xcite compiled the published data for 52 agns ( including 18 egret agns ) , for which measurements of the angular size and radio flux density of the vlbi core , proper motion of the components in the jet , and x - ray flux density were available .",
    "they applied the inhomogeneous jet model of @xcite to the sample and showed that the derived mean viewing angle for 14 egret sources is and the doppler factors of these sources are greater than 4.7 .",
    "these results also indirectly support the gamma - ray emission model by inverse compton scattering . however , there are still large uncertainties for the derived parameters in gamma - ray loud agns and it is therefore important to verify the milliarcsecond ( mas)-scale properties for individual sources precisely by vlbi observations .",
    "in this paper we report the results of an observation of pks 1622@xmath0297 ( j1626@xmath02951 ) by vsop ( vlbi space observatory programme ) , consisting of the radio - astronomy spacecraft halca and ground radio telescopes located around the world @xcite .",
    "vsop observations enable improvement of the angular resolution by up to a factor of three compared to ground - only vlbi observations at the same frequencies .",
    "pks 1622@xmath0297 is one of the gamma - ray emitting sources with a high - confidence identification by egret @xcite . during an outburst at epoch 1995.48 ,",
    "the source was the most luminous gamma - ray emitting agn ever detected and showed rapid gamma - ray variability by a factor of at least 3.6 in less than 7.1 hours @xcite .",
    "it is a strong , compact radio source optically identified as a quasar @xcite with a fractional polarization of more than 4% at cm - wavelengths @xcite .",
    "previous results of vlbi observations are described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "pks 1622@xmath0297 has also been reported to display intraday variability ( idv ) at 8.6ghz at two epochs in 1994 @xcite .",
    "both intrinsic and extrinsic origins have been suggested for idv @xcite , while current radio observations show that interstellar scintillation ( iss ) is mainly responsible for the rapid idv feature , such as the annual modulation in the scintillation timescale @xcite , and detection of time delay across the 10,000 km baseline between atca and vla @xcite .",
    "both intrinsic and extrinsic explanations require very compact source structure .",
    "we present here the results of multi - frequency multi - epoch monitoring of pks 1622@xmath0297 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and discuss the origin of the idv , and consider the gamma - ray emission mechanism based on both the vsop and atca observations .",
    "a redshift of @xmath5 was listed in @xcite , corresponding to an angular - to - linear scale conversion of 5.3@xmath6pcmas@xmath7 assuming a hubble constant , @xmath8 , of 100@xmath9kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , a flat universe with a cosmological constant , @xmath10 , and a pressureless matter density parameter , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , this redshift has been questioned @xcite , and so although we adopt it in this paper , it should be kept in mind that confirmation of this value is required .",

    "ground baselines . on the space  ground baselines ,",
    "however , we could detect significant fringes only within an hour from the beginning of the observation , corresponding to the shorter space baselines , and so we excluded the halca data after that time .",
    "we exported the fringe - fitted visibility data to difmap for imaging .",
    "at first we integrated the data over 10 seconds to reconcile the different preaveraging time from the correlator output , and performed several iterations of cleaning and self - calibration to the phases . to ensure a better angular resolution with the halca data",

    "rapid flux density variations of @xmath110% at both 4.8 and 8.6ghz were detected within the first eight hours ( see the upper panels of figure  [ fig : figure5 ] ) .",
    "if the observed flux density variations are intrinsic to the source , the variability brightness temperature , @xmath111 , can be calculated as @xmath112@xmath113k .",
    "this would require a doppler factor at least two orders of magnitude higher than estimated in section [ subsec : estimation of parameters ] from the vsop data for the intrinsic brightness temperature to remain below the inverse compton scattering limit , implying an intrinsic origin for the idv is highly unlikely .    as mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] , current radio observations show that iss is mainly responsible for the rapid idv features .",
    "we use the ne2001 galactic electron density model @xcite to investigate the likely effect of iss .",
    "the model predicts a transition frequency between weak and strong scattering of 31.7ghz on the line of sight to pks 1622@xmath0297 ( galactic coordinates @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) . in this case",
    "the observed frequencies would be in the strong scattering regime .",
    "the very rapid idv observed in a few sources has been shown to be due to weak scattering at frequencies @xmath116ghz , in very nearby turbulence @xcite .",
    "however the idv seen in pks 1622@xmath0297 has a characteristic timescale longer than a day .",
    "our two - day atca observations do not provide a sufficient sample of the variability pattern to estimate the characteristic timescale accurately .",
    "in many epochs we observe only a steady increase or decrease in flux density .",
    "even for the most extreme variations observed , in 2001 june as shown in figure  [ fig : figure5 ] , the variability pattern is not well - sampled .",
    "a characteristic timescale of several days is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation ( riss ) in the strong scattering regime as would be expected at 4.8 and 8.6ghz for a source along this line of sight through the galaxy .",
    "if the transition frequency is close to 30ghz , as expected from the ne2001 model , then applying the theory of strong scattering @xcite we would expect to see rms modulations of @xmath117% at 4.8ghz and @xmath118% at 8.6ghz for a source of angular size @xmath119 smaller than the scattering disk @xmath120 .",
    "if @xmath121 , then the modulation index will be reduced and the scintillation timescale increased by a factor @xmath122 .",
    "the ne2001 model predicts scattering disk sizes of 0.16mas at 4.8ghz and 0.04mas at 8.6ghz for the line of sight to pks 1622@xmath0297",
    ". the fitted angular size of component c from the 5ghz vsop data is then 34 times larger than the predicted scattering disk , we could therefore expect to see rms modulations of order 10% or @xmath123mjy in this component as a result of riss .",
    "the expected characteristic timescale would be of order one week , depending on the transverse bulk velocity of the scattering plasma with respect to the observer .",
    "it may also be the case that some fraction of the flux density of component c is in an even more compact component that is unresolved on vlbi scales , so that this would scintillate on a shorter timescale than the more extended component . after taking into account",
    "that pks 1622@xmath0297 has significant flux density , @xmath57jy , which is extended on mas to arcsecond scales , the rms variations observed in the atca data remain somewhat lower in amplitude than expected from the riss model .",
    "however , since we do not fully sample the scintillation pattern in the atca observations , the modulation index is almost certainly underestimated .",
    "we conclude that the idv observed in atca data is consistent with what is expected due to riss of the core component in pks 1622@xmath0297 .    as",
    "riss is a stochastic process , sampling of the variability over many more days would be required to accurately estimate the rms flux density variations and characteristic timescales .",
    "however , on longer timescales this source is also likely to show intrinsic variability which may complicate analysis .    with the addition of pks 1622@xmath0297 , short timescale variability within a few hours to a few days at cm - wavelengths",
    "has been reported in 28 sources ( 42% ) of 67 egret - identified agns to date ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "this compares with a general incidence for idv among flat - spectrum radio sources of between 10 and 20% ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , suggesting a higher incidence of idv among gamma - ray sources , a possibility which has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "if the idv is due to iss , each source should have a compact core between several tens to a few hundred @xmath124as , corresponding to a linear scale of about @xmath125 cm , depending on the source s distance .",
    "this linear scale of the core is similar to , or slightly larger than , those obtained by @xcite , assuming an external radiation compton model ( e.g. @xcite ) can account for the gamma - ray emission . again , the vsop-2 mission will enable the inner region of the core to be observed with a maximum angular resolution of 38@xmath124as , comparable to the linear scale of the gamma - ray emission region .",
    "vsop-2 would certainly be able to tell us more about how the core flux density is distributed and would allow us to measure scatter - broadening in sources which are moderately strongly scattered .",
    "we have observed the gamma - ray loud quasar pks 1622@xmath0297 using the halca satellite and three ground radio telescopes .",
    "the source was clearly resolved and we could determine three distinct features , the core and two jet components , and have confirmed that both jet components display superluminal motion . by using the inverse compton catastrophe model we estimated the doppler factor , @xmath2 , as 2.45 , and the jet viewing angle , @xmath24 , of each component as larger than .",
    "especially , the innermost component has very large viewing angle , @xmath126 . both @xmath2 and @xmath24 are rather different from other gamma - ray loud agns",
    "yet observed , though this may be due to the quasar being in a relatively quiescent ( i.e. , low brightness temperature ) state during the epoch of the vsop observation .",
    "although some previous theoretical and observational studies have implied the possibility of inverse compton scattering as the gamma - ray emission mechanism , the vsop observations at epoch 1998.15 do not on their own provide any supporting evidence .",
    "we have also presented the results of the atca total flux density monitoring between february 2001 and february 2002 .",
    "pks 1622@xmath0297 displays idv at both 4.8 and 8.6ghz throughout this year .",
    "the extremely high brightness temperature implied for the idv being due to fluctuations intrinsic to the source strongly favor refractive interstellar scintillation as the origin of the idv .    in either case , compact structure at a level significantly below the angular resolution of our vsop observations",
    "can be inferred .",
    "scattering models imply the existence of a compact core , @xmath127mas in angular size , or @xmath128 cm in linear size .",
    "this is comparable to the gamma - ray emitting region expected from the theoretical model .",
