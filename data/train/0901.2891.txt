    "<S> relative to the contact state , the solvent separated state becomes more stable with increasing pore length at @xmath42 nm ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pmf_q0.4]a ) , and also with increasing @xmath4 at fixed @xmath45 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> however , for the wider pores with @xmath69 and 2.0 nm , the opposite trend is observed ; increasing solute charge makes the ssm more stable relative to the contact minimum .    in the solvent separated state , the two solutes are stabilized in individual hydration shells with a single water molecule between them that is hydrogen bonded to other water molecules . from m@xmath70-water radial distribution functions ( data </S>",

    "<S> solute - solute interactions differ drastically from those in bulk solvent . </S>",
    "<S> hydrophobic interactions are altered more than electrostatic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> nonpolar solutes , such as the methane - methane pair , are driven to the pore surface to maximize solvent entropy . </S>",

    "<S> methane - methane free energy profiles show one contact minimum and two distant minima , at separations corresponding to the diameter and the length of the pore . </S>",
    "<S> the broad curvature of the free energy profiles is shown to be largely determined by the translational entropy of the solutes at the pore surface . </S>",
    "<S> the solvent drives the hydrophobic solutes either to contact or to the largest possible separation in the pore . </S>",
    "<S> the intervening minimum arises due to the greater solute entropy at @xmath60 min\\{@xmath61}. the stability of the distant minima , relative to the contact minimum , depends on the pore dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> model ions m@xmath10 and m@xmath11 , created by adding charges of magnitude @xmath13 or @xmath1 to the methanes , have a more favorable energy of interaction with the solvent . </S>",
    "<S> these charged solutes are solvated in the pore interior , away from the surface , and their interaction free energy shows a ssm . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath1 increases the stability of the solvent separated state for the pores with @xmath76 nm , which can accomodate a complete hydration shell around the ion pair . in narrower pores , increasing the ion charge destabilizes the ssm .    </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between charged species in cylindrical confinement can be rationalized using an interplay of two length scales . in the presence of charges , an additional length scale @xmath77 ( @xmath28 is the valence and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 is the dielectric constant ) plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> the balance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 determines the stability of the ssm . to a first approximation , the stability of the second minimum ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pmf_q0.4 ] and  [ fig : pmf_q1.0 ] ) is determined by @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath79 decreases at a fixed charge magnitude , the second minimum becomes more pronounced .    </S>",
    "<S> the preference of aliphatic groups to be localized at the pore boundary and charged species to be solvated in the pore interior can be used to infer the stability changes of peptides confined to cylindrical pores . for a generic amphiphilic sequence </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the reduction in the conformational entropy of the denatured states , with respect to the bulk , and the propensity of polar and charged residues to be fully solvated , should compensate for the tendency of hydrophobic species to be pinned at the interface . </S>",
