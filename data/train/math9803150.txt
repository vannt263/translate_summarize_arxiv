    "versions of theorem a ( for polynomial functions @xmath57 ) and of theorem e below were first formulated by a.  b.  kempe in 1875 @xcite , however , his statement of the theorem was vague and as far as we can tell , his proof requires corrections ( due to possible degenerate configurations ) .    * theorem e. * ( see  [ draw ] . )",

    "_    the main problem with kempe s proof is that it works well only for a certain subset of the moduli space , however near certain `` degenerate '' configurations the moduli space splits into several components and the linkage fails to describe the desired polynomial function ( see for instance  [ notion ] ) .",
    "we use the `` rigidified parallelograms '' to resolve this problem and get rid of the undesirable components .",
    "kempe s methods were also insufficient to prove theorem b and corollary c even if the problem of `` degenerate configurations '' is somehow resolved .",
    "the second obstacle in proving theorem b is that the restriction @xmath48 of the regular ramified covering @xmath63 to @xmath49 apriori does not have to be an analytically trivial covering :    \\(a ) it is possible that @xmath49 intersects the ramification locus of @xmath34 ;    \\(b ) even if @xmath48 is a _ topologically _ trivial covering it can fail to be _ analytically trivial _ covering because of `` quasiwalls '' ( see  [ elementary ] for various examples ) : think of the function @xmath64 .",
    "both problems of degenerate configurations and reflection symmetries of linkages were neglected ( or incorrectly resolved ) in the previous work we have seen ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the first precise formulation of a theorem of the above type was given by w.  thurston who stated a version of corollary c about 20 years ago and has given lectures on it since .",
    "he realized that such a theorem would follow by combining the 19-th century work on linkages ( i.e. kempe s theorem ) with the work of seifert , nash , palais and tognoli .",
    "however , thurston did not write up a proof so we have no way of knowing whether he overcame the problems discussed above in the 19-th century work on linkages",
    ". there is also ambiguity concerning which theorem thurston formulated in his lectures , we heard three different versions from three sources . according to the most recent ( april 1997 ) oral communication from thurston , he can also prove corollary c.    we would like to thank a number of people who helped us with this work .",

    "the moduli space @xmath1138 is ( polynomially ) isomorphic to the real algebraic set @xmath1139 .",

    "this story began with the invention of the steam engine by newcomen in 1722 .",
    "one problem that appeared naturally was to transform a periodic linear motion ( of the `` input '' vertex ) to a circular motion ( of the `` output '' vertex ) .",
    "the `` parallelogram '' invented by watt in the late 18-th century gave an approximate solution to this problem .",
    "the `` input '' motion was not exactly linear , however the input vertex traces a curve with a point of zero curvature , hence the output approximates a straight line up to the 2-nd order .",
    "after discovery in the first half of the 19-th century of several `` unsolvable '' geometric problems ( like squaring a circle , etc . ) , for a while it was a common opinion that the problem of transforming linear to circular motion also has no exact solution .",
    "this opinion was shared for instance by chebyshev who after thinking about this problem introduced _ chebyshev polynomials _ , partial motivation for which was the optimal approximate solution of the problem .",
    "there are several opinions on what happened next ( this caused a serious controversy between russian and french - british mathematical schools in the late 19-th century ) . in 1871",
    "lippman lipkin published the first detailed solution @xcite .",
    "two years later ( in 1873 ) peaucellier published a paper @xcite which also contained a detailed solution ( the _ peaucellier inversor _ ) identical to lipkin s . immediately after that several other ways to `` draw a straight line '' were discovered @xcite , @xcite . as far as applications are concerned it turned out that all the mechanisms that transform linear motion to circular are too complicated to be used instead of watt s parallelogram , invention of efficient lubricants had closed the problem .",
    "the only practical application of the inversor we are aware of was in air engines which ventilated the british parliament in 1870 - 1880-s ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 182 ) ) .",
    "[ kempthm ] suppose that @xmath1178 is an algebraic curve , @xmath1179 .",
    "then there exists an abstract closed @xmath9-functional linkage @xmath30 , a zariski closed algebraic subset @xmath1180 ( which is a union of irreducible components ) and an closed @xmath52 of @xmath37 in @xmath44 so that the restriction of the input map @xmath34 to @xmath327 is onto @xmath52 .      versions of kempe s proof were reproduced in a number of places ( see for instance @xcite ) , however ( as far as we know ) even the assertion was not made precise and details of the proof were not given .",
    "recently several ( written ) attempts were made to improve theorem [ kempthm ] , i.e. to make the subset @xmath327 open and @xmath1183 ( see @xcite ) and the projection @xmath1184 injective ( see @xcite ) , however , as far as we can tell , they were unsuccessful .",
