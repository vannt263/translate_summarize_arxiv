    "it is well known that the decay of close lying states in atomic systems can be quite different from that of the decay of an isolated state @xcite .",
    "this is because in the former case the transition amplitudes arising from each state can interfere with each other .",
    "this interference occurs provided the transition dipole matrix elements ( @xmath0 ) satisfy certain conditions@xcite . to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider two excited states @xmath1 and @xmath2 decaying to a common ground state @xmath3 . the condition for the interference between the two decay channels is @xmath4 as a consequence of ( 1 ) the populations and coherences get coupled in the density matrix equation @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the decay rate of the level @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "this coupling leads to some remarkable consequences as discussed in various references @xcite .",
    "for example , such coupling leads to quantum beats @xcite , phase dependent line shapes @xcite , quenching of spontaneous emission @xcite , lasing without inversion @xcite , and interference in decay of nuclear levels @xcite etc .",
    "the question arises - what are the systems for which the condition ( 1 ) holds ?",
    "consider for example the @xmath8 transition in an atomic system .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the above example denote the states @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in this case , simple algebra shows that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the reduced dipole matrix element .",
    "thus , the interference between two decay channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 will not occur .",
    "_ @xcite found states in sodium dimer where the spin - orbit coupling makes the dipole matrix elements non - orthogonal as the states get mixed .",
    "several proposals have been made @xcite to obtain non - orthogonality .",
    "however , it is desirable to examine how the condition ( 1 ) can be _",
    "bypassed_. the condition ( 1 ) arises from the fact that spontaneous emission occurs in two orthogonal modes of polarization . therefore if we _",
    "pre - select _ the polarization mode , then we do not need the condition ( 1 ) for interference to occur . in order to pre - select the polarization , we consider the problem of spontaneous emission in a mode selective cavity .",
    "it is of course known that the cavity can provide a good way to manipulate the spontaneous emission from an excited atom @xcite .    1.3 in    2.3 in    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the possibility of restoring quantum interference effects in spontaneous emission of an excited atom inside a cavity with its modes selected suitably , and thus avoid the condition ( 1 ) .",
    "a possible configuration is shown in fig.1 . in section",
    "ii , we describe the model atom which consists of two near - degenerate intermediate levels and orthogonal dipoles .",
    "the atom interacts with the cavity modes which are selected a priori .",
    "we consider the bad cavity limit and derive a master equation which shows evolution of quantum coherence between the degenerate or near degenerate levels .",
    "we obtain quantum beats in the populations of the intermediate states as well as the ground state .",
    "we present the solution of the master equation in section iii .",
    "we observe a decrease in the ground state population for some range of parameters .",
    "we compare these results obtained with and without interference terms . in section iv , we show that , suitable selection of cavity polarization plays vital role in determining the occurrence of interference . finally in section",
    "v , we make some concluding remarks .",

    "the above hamiltonian describes the reversible interactions between the atom and the cavity field .",

    "if the intermediate levels are degenerate ( @xmath101 ) , then @xmath102 is purely imaginary and therefore the trigonometric functions in eq.([sol ] ) change to hyperbolic functions - ceasing the oscillations in the populations .",

    "further we note that for @xmath106 , the ground state population decreases for a small time interval implying a population transfer to the intermediate levels .",
    "it should be borne in mind that , we work in the low - q cavity limit where cavity vacuum is not strong enough to cause the vacuum field rabi oscillation @xcite . to interpret the decrease in population , we go back to eq.([master ] ) .",
    "the 4th line of eq.([master ] ) suggests that the ground state population couples the intermediate state coherences via @xmath107 ( and @xmath108 ) ; e.g. , an emission followed by absorption of the same photon on a different transition . the corresponding transitions would correspond to @xmath109 ( and @xmath110 ) .",
    "the various transitions of @xmath111 type and various interference paths are illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "in particular from fig.5(b ) , one understands the decrease in the ground state population .    3.3 in",
    "we now examine the question - what leads to such coherences which otherwise do not occur .",
    "it is clear from eq.([den - eq ] ) that , the coherence terms are related to matrix elements like @xmath112 for the choosen geometry of fig.1 , eq.([product ] ) reduces to @xmath113 the later is non - vanishing ; as for @xmath114 transitions , @xmath115 , @xmath116 . note further that if polarization can not be pre - selected , then we have to sum eq.([product ] ) over the two possible polarization modes leading to @xmath117 under these conditions the coherence term can survive only if the dipole matrix elements are non - orthogonal .",
    "it is thus clear that , in order to see the interferences or beats at @xmath118 , one has to make a pre - selection of polarization so that coherence between @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be produced by spontaneous emission .",
    "note that this is different from the usual quantum beat spectroscopy @xcite where coherence is produced by excitation with an _ external field of appropriate band width_.",
    "in conclusion , we have shown : ( a ) how the pre - selection of polarization leads to certain types of interference effects which otherwise are missing unless the dipole matrix elements are non - orthogonal ; ( b ) how the pre - selection of polarization can be achieved in a cavity .",
    "we demonstrate this in the context of a four level atomic system in a bimodal cavity in the limit of a bad cavity .",
    "we hope to consider the effect of the cavity quality on intermediate states coherences elsewhere .              for studies on @xmath35-systems ,",
