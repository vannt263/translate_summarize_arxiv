    "the gps are identifiable with extreme versions of nearby blue compact dwarfs ( bcd ) galaxies , probably representing a major episode in their assembly history .",
    "this conclusion relies on recent results from detailed studies on their physical properties and chemical abundances , integrated star formation histories ( sfh ) , and photometric structure @xcite .",
    "they showed that gps are currently producing a significant fraction ( up to 20% ) of their total stellar mass ( @xmath9@xmath110@xmath1010@xmath11@xmath12 ) in a galaxy - wide starburst that takes place over a small ( @xmath123 kpc ) low - surface brightness exponential envelope , which might be due to more evolved stars .",
    "extended nebular emission excited by a strong ongoing starburst can , however , also produce a large exponential envelope , mimicking a stellar disk @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the ionized gas - phase in these galaxies show low oxygen and high nitrogen - to - oxygen ratios , clearly deviating from the median for local galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "all these properties led @xcite to suggest hydrodynamical effects e.g. , massive inflows and/or enriched outflows , as playing a key role before and during the short and extreme phase of mass growth where these dwarfs are seen as gps .    in order to further explore this hypothesis , we are conducting a comprehensive study of the ionized gas kinematics and chemodynamics in these low - mass starbursts . in this letter",
    "we present first outstanding results on the remarkably complex kinematics of a handful of gps observed using very deep , high resolution long - slit spectroscopy .",

    "this companion at @xmath17 kpc exhibits only pure  emission in the spectrum , and no counterpart is detected in sdss imaging .      since it was not possible to separate the different and relatively close spatial components in their corresponding 1d - spectra , the integrated 1d - spectra in the region of h@xmath24  and ",

    "as described in detail in @xcite , the method involves an iterative fitting of multiple gaussian components using the task ngaussfit in iraf .",
    "starting from the simplest solution , where the line profiles are formed by a broad- and a narrow - line component , the procedure adds extra gaussian components until the solution that best fits the observed profile is obtained . using this technique we obtain the different gaussian parameters for each component , allowing us to derive the radial velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersions , the latter were corrected from instrumental and thermal broadening .",
    "we considered here an instrumental width @xmath26@xmath1310.2 km s@xmath3 , as measured from the observed lamp arcs .",

    "an exception is j0040 , where  lines are too faint for a fitting attempt .",
    "the accuracy of the fit in the wings of the   emission is highlighted in the inset of figures  [ fig2a][fig2b ] .",
    "results from the  fitting , including velocity dispersions and the fractional emission measures ( in % ) for each kinematical component are presented in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "all the six observed galaxies show a composite of more than one _ strong _ narrow  components , spanning in a large range of velocity dispersions ( @xmath2@xmath110120 km s@xmath3 ) and luminosities ( l@xmath30@xmath110@xmath3110@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) . with the exception of j2325 , the  narrow components are blue- or red - shifted with respect to the line centroid by about @xmath32v@xmath150500 km s@xmath3 . especially remarkable",
    "are the cases of j1439 , j1615 , and j1454 , which presents shifts between some of their components larger than 350 km s@xmath3 . in two of these galaxies",
    "at least one secondary narrow component is spatially identified in their spectra , being located on a spatial extent @xmath33510 kpc .",
    "for the broad emission we found velocity dispersions and full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) in the range of @xmath2@xmath1100250 km s@xmath3 and @xmath16501750 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding broad  luminosities are exceedingly large @xmath15@xmath2810@xmath341.5@xmath2810@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 , representing @xmath14065% of the total h@xmath24  emission ( table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "only j1615 shows the broad emission significantly red - shifted ( @xmath1100 km s@xmath3 ) from the line centroid .",
    "remarkably , forbidden lines , such as  also show broad components .",
    "the broad emission in the wings of emission lines suggests very high velocity gas .",
    "different mechanisms have been explored in the literature to account for it in both giant extragalactic hii regions ( gehrs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bcds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these typically include ( 1 ) strong stellar winds caused by hot , massive stars , e.g. , wr , ofp , and lbv stars , ( 2 ) expansion of multiple sne remnants , ( 3 ) sne - driven superbubble blow - up , ( 4 ) effects of turbulent mixing layers ( tml ) , and ( 5 ) agns .",
    "the presence of large amounts of wr stars has been confirmed for two galaxies of the sample  j0040 and j2325  using high s / n osiris - gtc spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for some other gps ( e.g. j1615 and j1439 ) wr features are already detectable from sdss spectra @xcite . besides that , the strong ongoing starburst activity in gps @xcite and their clear detection in the radio continuum @xcite are consistent with a significant number of wr stars and sne",
    ". both dense circumstellar envelopes of hot massive stars with strong stellar winds ( e.g. , wrs ) and sne remnants can produce broad components with luminosities of about 10@xmath3510@xmath36 erg s@xmath3 and expansion velocities of @xmath37 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "our calculations confirm that the mechanical energy released by the sne ii expected from the measured broad l ( ) using starburst 99 models @xcite at the appropriate @xmath38 is fully consistent with their measured dispersions .",
    "therefore , the combined effects of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) appear as the probable dominant source for the observed broad emission .    other mechanisms like ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) appear unlikely as the sole explanation for the broad emission at kiloparsec scales .",
    "for example , the expansion velocity of a sne - driven superbubble in blow - up phase is generally higher by a factor of @xmath12 - 3 . if present",
    ", tmls do not appear to be a dominant effect at global scales .",
    "moreover , models show tmls only producing broad emission in balmer lines but not in forbidden lines @xcite , as observed in our galaxies .",
    "these broad components in the forbidden lines were also observed in circumnuclear regions @xcite , gehrs @xcite , and star - forming knots of the bcd haro  15 @xcite . very broad line emission with luminosities between 10@xmath3910@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 are also expected in galaxies with agn as due to accretion onto an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "the existence of rare low - metallicity dwarf galaxies with agn have been proposed in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although we can not rule it out , at this point the data for the gps studied as yet do not support this hypothesis .",
    "emission line ratios are consistent with pure starbursts and there is no evidence of hard non - thermal emission in none of these galaxies . a deeper examination of spectra looking for additional clues evidencing nuclear activity , e.g. presence of high ionization ions , and ifu data for studying the spatial distribution of the broad emission in these galaxies , are strongly required to reach more firm conclusions about this hypothesis .",
    "overall , the kinematics of the ism on kpc scales in the studied galaxies is likely witnessing strong star formation feedback .",
    "so we conclude that broad emission in both balmer and forbidden lines are mostly originated in strong gas outflows driven by the intense , galaxy - wide starburst taking place in these galaxies .",
    "decomposition of emission lines in multiple kinematical components with large velocity dispersions and luminosities suggest that the starburst episode takes place in several massive clumps .",
    "ensembles of star - forming knots / clumps distributed across the host galaxy are typical for nearby bcds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in compact starbursts at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to gain further insight into the properties of the star - forming components in gps , we processed archival hst / acs images of j2325 and j0040 in the filter f150lp with a flux - conserving unsharp - masking technique @xcite .",
    "the unsharp - masked images of these two gps ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) reveal a wealth of morphological substructure , notably three and six knots in j2325 and j0040 , respectively , with a projected separation between @xmath10.4 and @xmath11 kpc .",
    "interestingly , the number of photometrically detected knots is in both gps equal or larger than the kinematically distinct components revealed from ngaussfit .",
    "the compactness of gps precludes a morphological analysis based on ground - based imaging from the sdss . despite this , for the nearest galaxy ( j1615 ) , the sdss _ gri _ image after unsharp - masking reveails two main knots along the slit ( a and c in figure  [ fig3 ] ) , that can be associated with the two main narrow components in the spectrum .",
    "most bcd / hii galaxies show emission lines accurately fitted using single narrow gaussians and , eventually , one relatively broad component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity dispersion of the _ main narrow _ component in our sample galaxies is considerably higher than the average measured turbulent velocity dispersions of gehrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and still higher than those in local bcd / hii galaxies of similar broad - band luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "together with their compactness , these values are more consistent with those of strongly star - forming galaxies of similar luminosity at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than for nearby bcds .",
    "we interpret the composite profiles as an evidence of multiple massive star - forming clumps , distributed in a very small ( few kpc ) and dynamically young host galaxy . in line with results from both optical @xcite and near infrared integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) @xcite for uv - luminous starburst galaxies at @xmath6@xmath10.10.3 ,",
    "the observed high velocity dispersion suggests disturbed kinematics , likely driven by turbulence rather than rotation .",
    "qualitatively , gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and star formation feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear as possible mechanisms to inject energy to drive such high velocity dispersion .      for half of the galaxies",
    " j1615 , j1439 and j1454 ,  the large difference in radial velocity found between different components ( clumps ) can possibly be interpreted as a sign of ( clump - clump ) interaction or minor - mergers .",
    "mergers and tidal interactions with gas - rich , low - mass companions have been suggested as the main triggering mechanism for starbursts in nearby luminous bcds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these systems , closely resembling high - redshift lyman break galaxies @xcite , offer us a laboratory to study at high spatial resolution collisionally induced star formation and its rle on galaxy buildup .    in the remaining galaxies , where signs of interactions are not obvious",
    ", gravitational instabilities may be the main cause for the enhanced star formation .",
    "models suggest that large gaseous clumps formed by gravitational instabilities in primordial disks can drive significant and fast gas accretion , and trigger and sustain starburst episodes @xcite .",
    "those clumps massive enough ( @xmath4010@xmath41m@xmath42 ) to resist disruption by star - formation can eventually coalesce toward the center , loss angular momentum , and form a spheroidal system ( e.g. , a bulge ) in @xmath331 gyr @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , has been proposed for bursty systems at @xmath6@xmath401 @xcite , and suggested for some clumpy bcds in the local universe @xcite .",
    "in summary , observations for the six starburst galaxies presented here suggest that these systems are likely clumpy and highly turbulent , and with strong gas flows , probably as a consequence of strong star formation feedback .",
    "the above results highlight the important analogies found between the some local low - mass starbursts , like the gps , and star - forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "a further study with additional observations and including an analysis of physical properties and chemical abundances for the different kinematical component will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "furthermore , high  spectral and spatial  resolution studies using ifs , tracing both star formation and gas kinematics , appear essential to test models and disentangle the striking gas kinematics of the gps .",
