    "kac @xcite proposed in 1954 a random process to model the dynamics of a dilute gas .",

    "the case @xmath5 is of main interest , but we will allow any @xmath6 .",
    "since no account is taken of particle positions , any physical justification for the model relies on assumptions of spatial homogeneity and rapid mixing .",
    "it is thus impossible to give a physical meaning to the number of particles @xmath1 . yet , on the mathematical side , we have to make a choice .",
    "hence it is of interest to show consistency for sufficiently large values of @xmath1 .",
    "kac s process depends on a choice of collision kernel @xmath7 .",
    "this is a finite measurable kernel @xmath8 on @xmath9 which is chosen to model physical characteristics of the gas .",
    "the collision kernel specifies the rate for collisions of pairs of particles with incoming relative velocity @xmath10 and outgoing direction of separation @xmath11 .",
    "since collisions are assumed to conserve momentum and energy , for a pair of particles with pre - collision velocities @xmath10 and @xmath12 , and hence relative velocity @xmath13 , the post - collision velocities @xmath14 and @xmath15 are determined by the direction of separation through @xmath16 we will often write @xmath17 for the direction of approach , given by @xmath18 . we assume throughout that , for all @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a probability measure , supported on @xmath21 , and that the following standard scaling and symmetry properties hold . for @xmath22 and @xmath19 , and for any isometry @xmath23 of @xmath24",

    "the kac process with collision kernel @xmath7 and particle number @xmath1 is the markov chain in @xmath35 with generator @xmath37 given on bounded measurable functions @xmath38 by @xmath39 where @xmath40 the choice of state - space @xmath35 is possible because in each collision the number of particles , the momentum @xmath41 and the energy @xmath42 are conserved .",

    "the transition rates of the kac process are bounded by @xmath45 on @xmath35 .",
    "hence , by the elementary theory of markov chains , given any initial state @xmath46 , there exists a kac process @xmath47 in @xmath35 starting from @xmath48 , the law of this process is unique , and almost surely it takes only finitely many values in any compact time interval .",

    "we have avoided so far any mention of the boltzmann equation , which classically is the starting point for kinetic theory .",
    "we shall show in our other main results , theorem  [ cbe ] and corollaries [ cor ] and [ cor2 ] , that the consistency estimate leads quickly to existence and uniqueness of measure solutions for the spatially homogeneous boltzmann equation , and convergence to such solutions of the kac process in the large @xmath1 limit .",
