    "during the last decade , dynamic force microscopy ( dfm ) used in the tapping mode has been found as a suitable tool to investigate surfaces morphology and mechanical properties of soft materials .",
    "the technics has been widely used to investigate a wide range of samples including polymers @xcite , biological materials @xcite or organic layers @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the sensitivity of the oscillating tip - cantilever system ( otcl ) at the proximity of the surface , various physical properties can be investigated including mechanical properties @xcite , adhesion @xcite , forces mapping @xcite and dissipation processes @xcite . as a complementary approach",
    ", experiments performed in contact mode were widely used to probe chemical treatments of surfaces and evolution of surface properties .",
    "therefore , numerous works were dedicated to investigate adhesion and friction variations as a function of changes of the surface properties under various conditions  : humidity rate , vacuum or controlled atmosphere @xcite .    because dfm is a very sensitive tool probing forces is noncontact and intermittent contact situations , it is a suitable approach to investigate local properties without inducing severe damage on the surface .",
    "in particular , liquid layers and the influence of capillary forces have been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the presence of a liquid layer from molecular thickness up to a few nanometers can significantly modify the behavior of the otcl . in ref.@xcite , m.luna et al . discuss the influence of the conservative and non conservative forces due to the water adsorption onto various surfaces on the variation of the resonance frequency and quality factor of the otcl .    in the present work",
    ", we use dfm to investigate the growth of a water film on a silica surface at room temperature as a function of the exposure time . to do so",
    ", we use recent theoretical developments describing the influence of the noncontact dissipation ( nc dissipation ) on the observed phase delay during a tapping experiment @xcite .",
    "the silica surface is first cleaned and heated under oxygen flow at @xmath1{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c during @xmath2 minutes .",
    "then , it is put into a glove box under controlled atmosphere assuming that the water covering goes along .",
    "evolution of the surface is measured by recording approach - retract curves versus time that give the variations of the oscillation amplitude and phase as a function of the tip - surface distance .    in the first part of the paper ,",
    "we briefly recall the model used to take into account the surface modifications and nc dissipation processes .",
    "the second part is devoted to experimental results obtained with the cleaned and heated silica surface and a comparison with the theoretical developments .",
    "the experimental results are compared to those obtained with a previous tribological study performed in contact mode as a function of the sample temperature .",
    "the last part of the paper is a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "the present section gives a synthesis of the theoretical developments allowing analytical expressions of the nonlinear equations of motion of the otcl amplitude and phase variations as a function of the distance between the tip and the surface to be obtained in order to fit the experimental data .",
    "the aim of these equations is to reproduce the observed approach - retract curves and more particularly the increase of the phase delay due to the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface . by using a sphere - plane geometry with an attractive van der waals interaction @xcite describing the interaction between the tip and the surface  :    @xmath3 = -\\dfrac{hr}{6\\left [ d - z\\left ( t\\right ) % \\right ] } \\text { , }   \\label{equpotvanderwaals}\\ ] ]    the equations of motion are given by @xcite  :    @xmath4    in equ.[equpotvanderwaals],@xmath5 is the distance between the sample and the equilibrium position at rest of the otcl and @xmath6 the position of the tip at time @xmath7 with the driven frequency @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the surface hamaker constant and the tip s apex radius , respectively . from equ.[equcossin ] , one can extract the relationship between the oscillation amplitude and the tip - surface distance  :    @xmath11 ^{2/3 } } \\label{equdattr}\\ ] ]    in equ.[equdattr],@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the reduced amplitude , distance and frequency , respectively . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the resonance amplitude and resonance frequency of the otcl far from the surface , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the quality factor of the otcl given by @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the otcl damping coefficient in air .",
    "@xmath20 is a dimensionless parameter which is characteristic of the nonlinear coupling with @xmath21 , the cantilever stiffness .",
    "thus , varying @xmath22 with @xmath23 is equivalent to vary the strength of the attractive interaction @xcite .    in order to fit the experimental data , e.g. amplitude and phase variations as a function of the distance between the tip and the surface",
    ", it was shown that the introduction of an additional dissipation when the tip does not touch the surface was a necessary requirement that explained the increase of the phase delay @xcite .",
    "the additional dissipation is modeled as being the consequence of the otcl energy loss due to the mechanical response of the substrate induced by the attractive interaction with the tip @xcite .",
    "the substrate is modeled as a viscoelastic , thus described by its local stiffness @xmath24 and damping coefficient @xmath25 with a relaxation time @xmath26 .",
    "these works give a detailed explanation of the origin of an additional damping coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath28 with regard to the characteristic times of the otcl its oscillation period @xmath29 and the residence time of the tip at the proximity of the surface , @xmath30 two asymptotic regimes of dissipation can be deduced .",
    "@xmath30 is the residence time of the tip in the vicinity of the surface , e.g. when the coupling between the otcl and the surface is large and is given by @xmath31 @xcite , where @xmath32 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath28 ( see fig.[figtoustemps ] ) , two asymptotic behaviors are calculated .",
    "results are @xcite  :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 .",
    "thus the nc dissipation processes are controlled by the strength of the attractive interaction through a square dependence with the term @xmath35 .",
    "the limit of short relaxation times is @xmath36 for which the sample behavior is elastic - like . in that case",
    ", the local deformation of the surface follows the action of the oscillating tip without any phase delay ( see fig.[figtoustemps ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the dissipated energy goes to zero . for long relaxation times , the mechanical susceptibility of the sample scales as @xmath37 , then also the additional dissipated energy .",
    "the total damping coefficient of the otcl can be written as an equivalent damping term @xcite  :    @xmath38    leading to the variations of the sine of the phase ( see equ.[equcossin ] ) on the form  :    @xmath39    equ.[equsinfidissipnc ] is the one that is used to fit the experimental phase variations .",
    "the variation of the amplitude without including an additional dissipation is straightforwardly obtained from equ.[equdattr ] . in accordance with the known result that the dissipation reduces the nonlinear effects @xcite , a first consequence is a drastic reduction of the size of the hysteresis loop @xcite .",
    "when the otcl approaches the surface , the amplitude variations are similar .",
    "the main difference appears at the bifurcation spot where the magnitude of the amplitude jump is slightly frustrated .",
    "we have shown that equ.[equdattr ] was of some help to estimate the value of the @xmath40 product @xcite .",

    "then the sample is put into a glove box under nitrogen controlled atmosphere with one ppm ( part per million ) of water and oxygen and at room temperature .",
    "experiments of approach - retract curves were performed with a nanoscope iii @xcite operating in tapping mode into the glove box . in such conditions ,",
    "the cantilever behavior is very stable .",
    "a commercial silicon tip - cantilever tesp - ncl - w from nanosensors @xcite is used , with an announced stiffness of about @xmath42  n.m@xmath43 , a measured resonance frequency of @xmath44  hz and a quality factor of @xmath45 .",
    "particular attention was focussed on the quality of the otcl whose behavior has to be harmonic for quantitative measurements .",

    "the subscript `` free '' means that the oscillation conditions are measured at a tip - surface distance for which the tip does not interact with the surface , typically distances of ten nanometers or more .    to investigate the influence of water layers , all the experiments presented in this paper were performed with the same cantilever over three days . over those three days , no noticeable variation of the otcl parameters ( resonance frequency and quality factor )",
    "was observed .    * contact mode  :* nanotribological measurements are detailed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "here , we briefly recall the experimental conditions and present a synthetic result which will then be compared to dfm results ( see discussion )",
    ". the silica substrate is also cleaned and heated at @xmath1{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c under oxygen flow , then exposed to dry conditions .",
    "all experiments were performed in a glove box under dry conditions with nitrogen flow .",
    "this condition is necessary since experiments performed in air ( under uncontrolled humidity rate ) were not as much reproducible to extract a significant variation of the adhesion and friction as a function of the temperature .",
    "force curves and friction loops were recorded at temperature varying between @xmath49{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c and @xmath50{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] c @xcite .",
    "when the sample is taken out of the furnace , corresponding to the reference time set time zero , approach - retract curves are recorded every two or three hours , three days long . during the approach - retract curve ,",
    "when the bistable behavior occurs , the tip is at a vertical location far enough from the surface , in the range of one nanometer or more , to reduce the contribution of the nc dissipation . as a consequence",
    ", one can estimate that the bifurcation is only controlled by @xmath51 and @xmath15 through the @xmath52 dependence .",
    "nevertheless , note that the strength of the attractive force scaling as @xmath53 @xcite ( see also the @xmath54 dependence in @xmath30 ) , a too low value of the amplitude can not be used to perform the fits .",
    "therefore , the curves for which the noncontact ( nc ) situations occur allow to get an evaluation of the @xmath51 product from equ.[equdattr ] .",
    "for this set of experiments , the amplitude at which the first nc situation happens is @xmath55  nm @xmath56 . to simplify the analysis and use the fit of the experimental nc curves ,",
    "a typical value of the amplitude used is @xmath57  nm @xmath58 .",
    "the experimental measurements are then compared at different times .    in fig.[figfit_expenc ]",
    "are reported comparisons between experimental and theoretical curves for different amplitudes and different times .",
    "the equ.[equdattr ] used to fit the experimental data gives a reasonable agreement .",
    "the average value of the coefficient @xmath51 extracted from the fits is @xmath59  m@xmath60 .",
    "thus , by taking @xmath61  n.m@xmath43 , we get @xmath62  j.m . taking into account",
    "the fact that the very first nc situation is obtained for @xmath55  nm , it s expected that the radius of the tip is not very small since we usually observe nc situations on the silica for @xmath63  nm , or less @xcite .",
    "thus in that case , let s consider @xmath64  nm . as a consequence , we get for the silica @xmath65  j.",
    "this evaluation is in agreement with a previous result ( see below ) .",
    "the fits do not provide an accurate quantitative value of @xmath40 but allow to evaluate the variation of the strength of the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface as a function of time .",
    "the result of the fits obtained at different times for @xmath57  nm are given in fig.[figsynthr ] .",
    "any variation of the value of @xmath51 is noticed three days long .",
    "since the radius of the tip and the cantilever stiffness are constant parameters , a constant value of @xmath51 means that the hamaker constant remains nearly the same . therefore ,",
    "whatever the evolution of the silica surface during those three days , this evolution does not lead to a noticeable variation of the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface .",
    "the same method was used to compare the attractive interaction between a tip and a silica surface and the same tip and a grafted silica surface . from the fits",
    ", it was deduced that @xmath66  j.m and @xmath67  j.m @xcite .",
    "while it is difficult to evaluate the error on the @xmath9 values , the use of equ.[equdattr ] appears quite helpful either to compare two different surfaces or to evaluate the relative evolution of the surface properties for a given tip .",
    "as detailed in refs.@xcite , in tapping mode it is more convenient to use intermittent contact ( ic ) situations to evaluate the contribution of the nc dissipation on the phase delay .",
    "the main reason is that one needs to use an average distance between the tip and the surface,@xmath68 , that gives an order of magnitude of the strength of the attractive interaction @xmath69 \\simeq hr/\\left ( 6\\delta ^{2}\\right ) $ ] .",
    "to simplify our evaluation , we consider a fixed value of @xmath70 , typically @xmath71  nm . these assumptions are easily achieved with a large oscillation amplitude .",
    "note that for ic situations , @xmath72 is less than the percent of the amplitude and therefore @xmath73 . thus , while for pure nc situations one has two varying parameters , the closest distance @xmath68 and the oscillation amplitude @xmath54 , for ic situations a fixed value of the closest distance @xmath74 appears as a reasonable working assumption to evaluate the average contribution of the attractive interaction .",
    "experimental phase variations at different times and the theoretical curves obtained from equ.[equsinfidissipnc ] with the large values of @xmath28 ( @xmath75 , equ.[equtempslongs ] ) are shown in fig.[figfit_expeci ] .",
    "the phase jump increases as a function of time .",
    "this is predicted to be the consequence of an increase of the nc dissipation @xcite ( see also discussion ) .",
    "the phase variations are fitted as a function of the observed variations of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "there is only one varying parameter which is @xmath37 , the others parameters being evaluated ( @xmath40 ) , or estimated ( @xmath21 , @xmath74 ) .",
    "all the theoretical curves are obtained with the power law @xmath76 .",
    "fits performed with the other asymptotic regime , short relaxation times , with a power law @xmath77 ( equ.[equtempscourts ] ) can be separated unambiguously , as shown with fig.[figpowerdea ] .",
    "the mechanical susceptibility @xmath37 extracted from the fits exhibits a marked evolution versus time ( fig.[figevoldissip ] ) . since the fits of the @xmath40 product lead to a constant value ( fig.[figsynthr ] )",
    ", this result indicates a decrease of the surface damping coefficient .",
    "it is noteworthy recalling that the amount of nc dissipated energy corresponds to the ability of the surface to exhibit a viscoelastic displacement induced by the attractive interaction .",
    "therefore for surface relaxation times larger than that of the oscillation period , when @xmath25 decreases , a surface displacement proportional to @xmath37 leads to an increase of the nc dissipated energy .",
    "this is what is straightforwardly observed with the increase of the phase jumps of the curves with time ( fig.[figfit_expeci ] ) .",
    "such a variation of @xmath25 indicates an evolution of the surface structure and properties as a function of time . just after the heating process ,",
    "only a few water molecules , if any , cover the surface and are tightly bounded to the silica . in that case , the water layer might be considered as an amorphous layer with long relaxation times corresponding to a high damping coefficient .",
    "the mechanical susceptibility of these molecules is weak so that the surface is weakly perturbed by the tip - surface attractive interaction .",
    "when the sample is exposed , even in a dry atmosphere , water molecules are more and more adsorbed on the surface , leading to a more fluid - like behavior of the surface with a higher molecular mobility and , in turn , a shorter relaxation time . nevertheless , as shown with fig.[figpowerdea ] , the use of the short relaxation times model does nt provide a good agreement with the observed phase variations .",
    "even @xmath78 hours after the beginning of the experiments , it s still possible to fit the experimental data with the long time model ( fig.[figfit_expeci ] , diamonds symbols ) . in ref.@xcite , the experimental phase variations on the silica could not be fitted with the long times model , but only with the short times one .",
    "but in that case , no thermal treatment of the silica had been used and the surface was placed into the glove box for many days . from these results , one can deduce that the quantity of water layers on this latter surface should be larger than the one on the thermally treated surface , even @xmath2 hours after the beginning of the experiments .",
    "while equs.[equtempscourts ] or [ equtempslongs ] aim at describing pure nc situations , questions rise about the origin of the information which is measured within tapping experiments . as explained above , in tapping mode , one has two varying parameters to fit the experimental variations  : @xmath54 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath54 varying during the approach - retract curves , @xmath70 too .",
    "this leads to complex situations if one wants to extract nc dissipation parameters from the pure nc situations .",
    "this is mainly the reason why , ic situations are used , @xmath70 being fixed to an average value , @xmath79 , of about a few angstroms .",
    "but as a consequence , @xmath74 might be as well fixed to the so - called contact distance @xcite , @xmath80 nm , thus changing the magnitude of @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , by choosing @xmath81  nm instead of @xmath82  nm , the value of @xmath25 obtained would be @xmath83 times larger because of the @xmath84 dependence in equ.[equtempslongs ] .",
    "this makes absolute quantitative measurements difficult to achieve . as a consequence ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath25 reported in fig.[figevoldissip ] is only indicative since it could has been one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the dfm results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from contact mode and ftir spectroscopy @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "we had focused on the influence of capillary effects due to the presence of water layers on the nanotribological properties as a function of the sample temperature .",
    "the variations of the pull off force and of the frictions forces were reasonably well explained by assuming the creation of a water meniscus between the tip and the surface .",
    "when the tip is pulled off the surface ( adhesion force ) or moved laterally ( tangential force or friction ) , a gap is created between the tip and the silica surface and is filled with a liquid phase .",
    "the afm measurements show a net decrease of the measured forces as the temperature increases . as an example",
    ", the decrease of the pull off force as a function of the temperature is shown in fig.[figevoladh ] .",
    "the abrupt decrease observed around @xmath85c suggests that capillary forces provide a major contribution to the pull off and tangential forces at room temperature .",
    "the nature of the water layer on silica versus temperature was also analyzed by ftir spectroscopy and correlated to the water layers morphology .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the spectrums obtained gives two kinds of water layers  : liquid layers , which are removed above @xmath85c and strongly adsorbed water molecules with a solid - like behavior that still remain at @xmath86c and under vacuum . in this latter case ,",
    "the water layers become more structured due to the proximity of the substrate . for the liquid structure ,",
    "we assume a molecular mobility that is weakly dependent on the thickness of the water film .",
    "when the temperature increases , the decrease of these forces is related to a structural modification of the water layers .    the comparison between the evolution of the damping coefficient as a function of time deduced from the tapping experiments ( fig.[figevoldissip ] ) and the one of the normalized pull off force ( fig.[figevoladh ] ) as a function of the temperature , suggests that the first tapping measurement performed at time zero corresponds to the data measured at @xmath87c with the contact mode ( arrow @xmath88 on both figures ) .",
    "thus we can deduce an equivalence between time exposure of the sample to dry conditions and temperature of the sample .",
    "the covering of the silica going on with time , e.g. the quantity of the water molecules adsorbed on the surface increasing , the damping coefficient decrease can be interpreted as a decrease of the equivalent temperature of the sample ( from arrow @xmath88 to @xmath89 on fig.[figevoldissip ] and from @xmath89 to @xmath88 on fig.[figevoladh ] ) .",

    "dynamic force microscopy experiments were performed to investigate the growth of water layers on a silica surface exposed to a rather dry atmosphere as a function of time .",
    "noncontact dissipation due to the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface is included in the theoretical developments .",
    "this allows to describe the evolution of the otcl phase as a function of time that corresponds to changes of the water layers structure .",
    "the equations obtained from the model are able to reproduce with a good agreement the experimental observations .",
    "these variations can only be reproduced from the model taking into account rather long relaxation times .",
    "the damping coefficient deduced shows a marked decrease as a function of time .",
    "as a consequence , the evolution of the mechanical susceptibility of the silica surface indicates the contamination of the surface with water molecules as a function of time .",
    "these dfm observations are in good agreement with previous tribological and infra - red measurements for which the contamination of a silica surface with water molecules was investigated as a function of the sample temperature .",
