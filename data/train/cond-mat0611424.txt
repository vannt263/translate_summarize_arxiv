    "granular flows are often separated into two categories dealing with ( i ) dense granular flows where the flow density is not far from the density of static packing ( for studies in 2 dimensions see @xcite or in 3 dimensions see @xcite ) and ( ii ) a rapid , very dilute ( gas ) regime @xcite , which is often analyzed in terms of a kinetic theory @xcite ) . although flow on a rough inclined plane has become a model experiment because of its simple geometry most of the available research focuses on the dense regime while less data is devoted to characterizing the gas regime and the transition between the dense and very dilute phase regimes .",
    "a granular layer of thickness @xmath2 on a rough inclined plane starts flowing only if the plane inclination @xmath3 surpasses a critical angle @xmath4 and stops flowing when @xmath3 is decreased below an angle of repose @xmath5 ( for reviews see : @xcite ) .",
    "experiments in 3 dimensions typically feature a storage container with an opening of height @xmath6 that influences the volume flow rate of material down the plane @xcite .",
    "the properties of granular flows in this system have been extensively studied when @xmath3 is not much larger than the flow initiation conditions @xcite . for @xmath7 and for small volume flow rates , intermittent flows",
    "are observed @xcite including avalanches @xcite and wave - like motion @xcite . at somewhat larger @xmath3 ,",
    "the grains flow uniformly with a statistically steady flow velocity that depends on the layer height @xcite .",
    "for still higher @xmath3 , the flow properties have not been well studied although an interesting stripe state has been reported @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the layer density would decrease as @xmath3 is increased because of higher average flow velocity which creates larger shear rates and higher granular temperature . because the ratio of the down - plane force to the normal force diverges at @xmath8 , one might also ask whether a dense phase with a well defined layer thickness continues to exist at large @xmath3 .",
    "flowing granular layers can be described by a set of macroscopic variables that depend on the system control parameters .",
    "the two control parameters for granular flow on a rough inclined plane are the hopper opening @xmath6 and the inclination angle @xmath3 .",
    "the hopper opening largely influences the volume flow rate from the hopper whereas @xmath3 controls the balance of tangential and normal gravitational force on the layer .",
    "an additional parameter that is harder to vary systematically is the roughness of the inclined plane surface . for fixed surface roughness ,",
    "the flow properties of the layer at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath3 can be characterized by the surface velocity , the height @xmath2 and the average density @xmath9 .",
    "these quantities depend on the control parameters and on each other in a complicated manner .",
    "part of our purpose in this paper is to understand these relationships .",
    "one particular issue for granular flows at high inclination angles was suggested by idealized numerical simulations in which gravitational forcing can not be balanced by energy dissipation mechanisms , and the flow is predicted to accelerate @xcite .",
    "constitutive equations recently proposed for dense granular flows suggest that the effective friction coefficient saturates to a finite value @xmath10 for high shear rates @xcite . in this case the flow is expected to accelerate for @xmath3 above @xmath11atan@xmath12 .",
    "as we will show in the present work , in accordance with the data presented in @xcite the dense , non - accelerating regime can only be observed up to tan@xmath13tan@xmath14 . for the case of density",
    "we show , that @xmath9 is observed to decrease substantially from its closed - packed value at plane inclinations starting from tan@xmath13tan@xmath15 ( in our case tan@xmath16tan@xmath17 ) . at very high plane inclinations where",
    "a very dilute gas phase is observed the equation of state is certainly much different than for the dense flows and the above criterion is not relevant . for the case of velocity @xmath18 ,",
    "our characterization of @xmath18 as a function of downstream distance demonstrates that there is a healing length of order the size of our inclined plane for moderate plane inclinations that complicates a comparison with the predictions for an acceleration threshold .",
    "we conclude that because of the limited plane length our data are not complete enough to make a quantitative prediction of the angle up to which stationary flows exist .",
    "as demonstrated in other experiments , air can sometimes have a profound effect on the observed behavior of the granular flow as in , for example , segregation of vertically - vibrated granular materials @xcite , discharging hourglasses @xcite , or impact studies @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to characterize the properties of granular flow at high inclination angles , it is important to understand how air interacts with the granular flow and to determine the level of fluidization and grain velocity when the role of air drag is no longer negligible .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize the flow of relatively mono - dispersed sand particles on a rough inclined plane .",
    "the experimental apparatus , that allows for measurements of flow conditions as a function of air pressure , and a characterization of the average terminal velocity of individual grains with different mean sizes and material composition are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we describe our measurements of granular layer velocity , height and density as a function of hopper opening @xmath6 .",
    "we summarize our findings in a phase diagram that includes the transition to a gaseous phase .",
    "finally , we conclude with some discussion of the implications and further opportunities for the system of granular flow on an inclined plane .",
    "we start by characterizing the granular material and describing the experimental apparatus used to make quantitative measurements of the flow . for determining the flow properties of the granular layer , we used sand that was sifted with 300 and 500 @xmath19 m sieves to yield a mean diameter of @xmath20 m .",
    "we designate this distribution as having a mean of @xmath20 m and a standard deviation of @xmath21 m .",
    "we also used finer sand , salt and glass beads to help calibrate the air drag effects .    the experimental setup used for measurements of inclined plane flows",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "a glass plate with dimensions 230 cm x 15 cm was set inside a 274 cm long , 20 cm diameter cast - acrylic tube .",
    "the leftmost 40 cm of the tube ( full with sand in the image ) serves as the hopper .",
    "the surface of the remaining part ( 190 cm ) of the glass plate was made rough by gluing one layer of grains onto it or by covering the plate with sandpaper that had a characteristic roughness of 190 @xmath19 m ( 80 grit ) . the same flow regimes were observed for both surfaces . because the surface of the sandpaper was slightly smoother , we observed a small ( about 10@xmath22 ) increase of the flow velocity compared to the case of grains glued onto the plate .",
    "the tube was rotatable about the middle so that we could set an arbitrary inclination angle @xmath3 .",
    "the whole system could be pumped down to @xmath23 0.5 mbar .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath18 at the surface was determined by analyzing high speed ( 8000 frames per second ) recordings .",
    "space time plots were created by taking one line of the recordings parallel to the main flow .",
    "the fourier transform of such an image ( consisting of streaks as traces of particles in the flow ) yields the average velocity of surface particles .",
    "the thickness of the flow @xmath2 was monitored by the translation of a laser spot formed by the intersection with the surface of a laser beam aligned at an angle of @xmath24 with respect to the inclined plane .",
    "the flow properties were characterized by varying two control parameters : the plane inclination @xmath25 and the hopper opening @xmath26 cm ( _ i.e. _ @xmath27 ) . setting a constant @xmath6",
    ", we observed a slight increase of the hopper discharge rate when increasing @xmath3 , _",
    "e.g. _ , see fig .",
    "[ discharge ] .",
    "the hopper discharge rate also depended on the presence of air in the system @xcite . in a typical hourglass geometry ,",
    "when the hopper and the main chamber are separated , the flow of sand faces a counterflow of air as the hopper discharges and a pressure difference builds up . without a connection between the two chambers in our experiment , the hopper discharge rate was significantly smaller ( by about @xmath28 ) in the presence of air when compared to the case in vacuum . by connecting the two chambers with a flexible tube ,",
    "the counterflow was substantially reduced , and the discharge rate was about @xmath29 of the discharge rate observed in vacuum ( fig .",
    "[ discharge ] ) .",
    "all the measurements presented here were done for the case of reduced counterflow .    to set the stage for our discussions of air effects in inclined plane flows , we introduce some results related to the interaction of granular particles with air . one way in which air can affect a granular flow is through the drag force of air acting on an isolated particle . given a spherical particle of radius @xmath30 ( diameter @xmath31 ) and density",
    "@xmath32 falling under gravity @xmath33 in air with dynamic viscosity @xmath19 and density @xmath34 , the equation of motion is @xmath35 where the buoyancy term is ignored since @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a turbulent drag correction @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the turbulent drag coefficient @xmath37 yields a good approximation for the range of velocities that are of interest here .",
    "the terminal velocity @xmath40 is obtained by setting @xmath41 and solving numerically the equation @xmath42    the air drag on the individual grains is characterized by the reynolds number @xmath43 of a particle of diameter @xmath31 falling at velocity @xmath44 .",
    "taking spherical particles with @xmath45 mm and with the density of sand @xmath46 g/@xmath47 , by solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn : eom2 ] ) numerically we obtain @xmath48 m / s with a corresponding @xmath49 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 were also measured by dropping particles from 2.7 m. all of the particles reached a terminal velocity where the change in their velocities was below @xmath50 over a 7 cm interrogation window .",
    "the velocity distribution reflecting the variations in particle size and shape is presented for 100 particles in fig .",
    "[ terminalvelo ] .",
    "the average value of the terminal velocity for the 400 @xmath19 m sand is @xmath51 m / s .",
    "the measurements were also done for fine sand @xmath52 m , salt @xmath53 m and glass beads @xmath54 m , yielding the the velocity distributions presented in fig .",
    "[ terminalvelo ] .",
    "the corresponding mean values of @xmath40 are @xmath55 m / s , @xmath56 m / s and @xmath57 m / s , respectively .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath40 are indicated with a vertical line for each case .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath40 are close to the measured values with deviations between data and theory presumably resulting from non - spherical shapes and/or uncertainties in the mean particle diameter .",
    "for example , the deviations observed for the two sets of sand can be consistently explained with non - centered size distributions .    having determined that our calculation of @xmath40 agrees well with the measured data , we used eq .",
    "[ eqn : eom2 ] to estimate the air drag reduction and the resulting increase in @xmath40 as a function of air pressure .",
    "the dynamic viscosity @xmath19 of air is almost constant as a function of air pressure @xmath58 .",
    "using an ideal gas relationship between @xmath34 and p and eq .",
    "[ eqn : eom2 ] , one obtains @xmath40 ( and @xmath59 ) as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ vt - pressure ] , @xmath40 is expected to increase by a factor of 4 when @xmath58 decreases to 0.5 mbar .",
    "if air drag plays a significant role in determining the granular flow state , the substantial decrease in air drag under vacuum will reveal that effect .",
    "here we ignore the expected further increase in the terminal velocity at very low pressures when the air mean free path is comparable to the particle diameter .",
    "another approach to estimating the effect of air drag on a flowing granular layer is to assume that the granular layer is similar to a fluid and that the air forms a boundary layer between air at large distance with zero velocity and the granular layer flowing with a `` surface velocity '' @xmath44 .",
    "a prandtl boundary layer description yields a boundary layer thickness @xmath60 where @xmath0 is the downstream distance .",
    "the force per unit area @xmath61 exerted on the flow by the entrained air is approximately @xmath62 .",
    "the relevant parameters of the air are @xmath63 pa s , @xmath64 kg / m@xmath65 ( for local pressure @xmath66 ) , and @xmath67 . taking a distance @xmath68 cm and @xmath69 cm / sec , one obtains @xmath70 cm and @xmath71 n / m@xmath72 which is less than 0.1@xmath22 of the gravitational force @xmath73 a negligible effect .",
    "the surface of a granular flow , however , is not as sharply defined as it is for liquid flows .",
    "if there were substantial fluidization of the granular layer , the cumulative drag force experienced by the low density particles might play a role in the instabilities of the homogeneous flow .",
    "based on qualitative observations of the flow and on quantitative measurements presented below , we can separate the granular flow into regions with certain characteristic features .",
    "such a phase diagram identifying the different flow regimes as a function of the two control parameters @xmath6 and @xmath3 is shown in fig .  [ phasediagram ] .",
    "the ratios tan@xmath3/tan@xmath5 and @xmath74 are also shown on the top and right axes , respectively , where @xmath75 is the independently measured bulk angle of repose for the granular material used here .",
    "the boundaries are neither precisely defined nor indicative of sharp transitions between different flow regimes .",
    "further , this phase diagram does not capture the convective nature of the granular flow in that features or flow properties may evolve over length scales comparable to the length of the inclined plane .",
    "nevertheless , identification of the general regimes are useful in setting the stage for more complex issues raised below .    at very slow flow rates and low plane inclinations",
    "the homogeneous flow is unstable and organizes itself into waves .",
    "the properties of such waves have been studied extensively @xcite . by increasing the flow rate and staying in the range of not very steep plane inclinations ( up to about @xmath76 ) ,",
    "the flow becomes homogeneous . for steeper planes an instability occurs leading to a pattern consisting of lateral stripes @xcite .",
    "a detailed characterization of the stripe state in our system will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the dashed line divides the diagram into two regions : accelerating and @xmath1invariant steady flows . above the dashed line the acceleration of the flow ( averaged over the range of @xmath77 cm ) was more than 5% of g sin@xmath78",
    "this boundary depends on the distance downstream @xmath0 at which the acceleration was measured as discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ subsec : velocity ] .",
    "the phase diagram was found to be qualitatively the same for flow at ambient pressure and flow at low pressure with @xmath79 mbar .        the plane of the images shown in fig .",
    "[ laserspot ] was parallel to the inclined plane .",
    "a laser beam projected from the left hand side of the image at an angle of @xmath24 with respect to the plane of the image produced a localized laser spot .",
    "the first image , fig .",
    "[ laserspot]a , shows the case of the empty chamber without flow , where the laser beam was reflected by the rough surface of the inclined plane . the other images ( b - h ) were taken in the presence of flow at a constant hopper opening @xmath80 cm and downstream distance @xmath81 cm with increasing @xmath3 as we go from ( b - h ) .",
    "the laser beam was reflected from the particles at the surface of the flowing layer . the horizontal shift of the laser spot with respect to image ( a ) measured the thickness of the flowing layer .",

    "i.e. _ , the surface of the flow was well defined ( figs .",

    "[ laserspot ] . because of the increasing fluctuations in the laser spot intensity for the higher @xmath3 , averaging over many images was necessary .    for the relatively dense regime ( with a compact laser spot ) , the position of the center of mass of the laser spot was taken as the flow thickness @xmath2 . in the very dilute regime",
    "we integrate the @xmath84 curves and define @xmath2 as the height below which 80@xmath22 of the flowing grains were detected .",
    "the flow density was measured in the following manner . a stationary flow was established and was maintained for about 4 seconds .",

    "@xmath6 leads to increasing levels of fluidization and to a transition to the gaseous phase . in this regime , see fig .",
    "[ height - velo]b , the density of the flow rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath6 and the measured thickness rapidly increases .",
    "contrary to trends for the fluid - like phase , the leftmost data points of the curves in fig .",
    "[ height - velo]b correspond to the highest hopper flow rates and the rightmost ones to the lowest hopper flow rate .",
    "thus , the flow is not simply determined by ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 ) as is the case for dense flows . for a given @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 , two solutions exists , one corresponding to a dense phase and the other to a very dilute one , depending on the flow rate .    a recent linear stability analysis indicated , that the air drag could play a role in the development of stripe patterns in the fluid - like regime @xcite . according to our findings the density of the flow for the stripe state was in the range of @xmath131 , corresponding to the regime where the role of the air drag is minor .",
    "the flow properties are not affected even at flow velocities near the terminal velocity in free fall . at the transition to the gaseous state",
    "the stripes disappear and the rapid decrease of the flow density leads to visible effects of air drag .    in summary , we have presented a detailed description of granular flow on a rough inclined plane - one of the most commonly used model systems for granular dynamics - concentrating on the fast flow regime .",
    "we developed a method to measure the depth averaged normalized flow density @xmath85 and characterized the flow regimes as a function of @xmath85 .",
    "we have characterized the transition to a very dilute gaseous phase that takes place by increasing plane inclination and decreasing incoming flow rate . by measuring the flow properties at ambient pressure and at low pressure ( @xmath138 mbar ) in a vacuum flow channel",
    "we have shown that the dissipation by the air drag ( with respect to the other dissipational processes ) is non - negligible only in the dilute gas - like phase .",
    "other implications of this work involves the possibility of linking changes in the flow structure ( such as the stripe state ) as a function of plane inclination to the change in the depth averaged normalized flow density @xmath85 .",
