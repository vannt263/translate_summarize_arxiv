    "the so - called `` missing baryon problem '' actually refers to two separate , but related , issues .",
    "first is the realization that the mean density of all detected baryons in the local universe accounts for less than half of the cosmological baryon density .",
    "the universal baryon fraction is known precisely from , among other sources , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 5-year data ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) : @xmath3 and @xmath4 . but studies that attempt to count baryons in the low - redshift universe ( fukugita , hogan , and peebles 1998 , fukugita and peebles 2004 , nicastro et al .",
    "2005a ) find that only about a tenth of this figure is observed in stars and cool gas in galaxies , while another third of @xmath5 is divided between the hot plasma in the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters , and the cool intercluster gas detected in ly@xmath6 absorption lines ( for more on the latter , see e.g. penton , stocke , and shull 2004 ) .",
    "this result introduces the second missing baryon problem , which is the realization that most galaxies are severely baryon - depleted relative to the cosmological fraction ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2003 ) . based on cosmological simulations ,",
    "the rest of the baryon budget is thought to reside in the `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) , at temperatures between @xmath7 and @xmath8 k ( cen and ostriker 1999 , dav et al .",
    "this is thought to include most of the baryons associated with galaxies , since the optically - luminous portion of galaxies is severely baryon - depleted relative to the universal fraction ( dai et al .",
    "observational evidence for the existence of the whim has subsequently begun to accrue , primarily through detections with ultraviolet and x - ray telescopes of highly - ionized oxygen absorption lines ( for a recent review , see bregman 2007 ) .",
    "these observations do not yet constrain the nature and distribution of the whim .",
    "essentially all models agree that the whim exists as a cosmic filamentary web with some material in hot haloes around galaxies , but the mass fraction as a function of whim density is still unknown . some numerical models ( e.g dav et al .",
    "2009 ) find a diffuse whim at @xmath9 with most of its baryonic content lying outside of galactic haloes .",
    "however , many simulations either assume ( e.g. bower et al . 2006 , croton et al .",
    "2006 ) or self - consistently derive ( e.g. cen and ostriker 2006 , tang et al .",
    "2009 , kim , wise , and abel 2009 ) the result that cosmologically significant reservoirs of baryons are embedded in hot haloes around massive galaxies ( @xmath10 a few hundred ev ) .",
    "these hot haloes have also been modeled in separate theoretical calculations ( fukugita and peebles 2006 , dekel and birnboim 2006 , kaufmann et al .",
    "2009 ) and have important consequences in the galaxy formation process such as differentiating the `` blue cloud '' from the `` red sequence '' ( dekel and birnboim 2006 , bouch et al . 2009 ) .",
    "observationally , the evidence for hot haloes is still unclear : gas at these temperatures has been observed in x - rays around disk galaxies out to a few kpc beyond the disk ( strickland et al .",
    "2004 , li et al .",
    "2006 , li , wang , and hameed 2007 ) , but this gas seems to result from starburst activity in the host galaxy instead of emerging as a byproduct of galaxy formation ( rasmussen 2009 ) , and its inferred mass falls significantly short of theoretical predictions ( tllmann et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the implications of this paradigm in more detail .",
    "if most of the baryons associated with galaxies reside in hot haloes around the optically luminous part , there are several predictions that can be tested with existing observations .",
    "we seek to answer two questions .",
    "first , how much baryonic mass resides in these haloes ? and , what can these haloes and the second missing baryon problem tell us about the process of galaxy formation ?    to answer these questions , we present several independent lines of argument .",
    "first , we consider observational constraints on the density of hot gas around the milky way using the dispersion measure of pulsars in the large magellanic cloud , as well as the ambient pressure around high velocity clouds , and the galactic soft x - ray background .",
    "we then extend this argument to other galaxies .",
    "we constrain the characteristic density and radius of hot haloes using existing x - ray observations of absorption along quasar sightlines and emission from galactic haloes .",
    "we also discuss the energetics of driving a galactic - scale wind , arguing that existing mechanisms for expelling most of the missing baryons seem incomplete .",
    "finally , we discuss flattened density profiles and other prospects for resolving the second missing baryon problem . before engaging these arguments , however , we will begin by describing the assumptions we use to model hot haloes , which are very similar to those of fukugita and peebles ( 2006 ) .",
    "much of the following discussion directly relates to the milky way or uses scaling relations to extrapolate from the galaxy to other galaxies . therefore we begin by discussing the parameters and scaling relations used throughout this paper .",
    "recent estimates for the virial mass of the milky way vary significantly .",
    "the consensus figure is roughly @xmath11 ( sakamoto , chiba , and beers 2003 , bellazzini 2004 , loeb et al .",
    "2005 , li and white 2008 ) , although a recent estimate was as low as @xmath12 ( xue et al .",
    "2008 ) while another ( reid et al . 2009 ) revised upwards the circular velocity by about 15 km s@xmath13 , which should increase the mass estimate by more than 10% . since larger masses for",
    "the galaxy increase the amount of missing baryons , we will adopt a conservative virial mass estimate of @xmath14 .",
    "regarding the virial radius of the milky way , there is scatter around a central value .",
    "shattow and loeb ( 2009 ) use @xmath15 for a solar distance from the milky way center of @xmath16 kpc , while the earlier work of loeb et al .",
    "( 2005 ) uses a virial radius of 207 kpc .",
    "klypin , zhao , and somerville ( 2002 ) favor a virial radius of 258 kpc .",
    "we adopt an estimate for the virial radius of 250 kpc .",
    "another relevant galactic parameter is amount of missing baryons .",
    "there is a surprisingly tight correlation between the total mass of a galaxy and its baryon fraction ( mcgaugh 2000 , dai et al .",
    "2010 ) , which we parametrize as @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the relation flattens significantly for galaxy groups and clusters , but those are outside the scope of this work .",
    "this implies a baryonic mass of @xmath19 for the galaxy , which broadly comports with the estimate of a stellar mass of @xmath20 for the galaxy ( binney and tremaine 2008 ) , with an additional @xmath21 in gas and dust .",
    "we assume the total mass is comprised of three components : the dark matter halo , the observable baryons in the galaxy , and the missing baryons in a hot halo . in this model",
    ", the mass of the missing baryons can be related to the observed mass @xmath22 of the other two components :    @xmath23    for the milky way , the missing baryonic mass is therefore @xmath24 . as a simple first - order model ,",
    "we assume some fraction of the missing mass is distributed in a hot virialized halo around the disk",
    ". we can model the gaseous halo by assuming the galactic dark matter halo obeys a navarro , frenk , and white ( nfw ) profile ( navarro , frenk , and white 1997 ) ) .",
    "the missing baryons would follow the gravitational potential set by the dark matter , and therefore also obey the same density profile , except that the missing baryons do not extend into the disk , so we occasionally truncate the gaseous halo at an inner radius @xmath25 ( this does not have a significant effect on our analysis ) .",
    "we examine many values for @xmath25 and for the nfw concentration parameter @xmath26 , but our nominal choice will be @xmath27 kpc and @xmath28 ( so @xmath29 kpc ) .    finally , the gaseous halo is assumed to be approximately isothermal at the virial temperature @xmath30 ev .",
    "this is also the temperature of the hot gas observed around ngc 891 ( tllmann et al .",
    "2006 ) , a near twin of the milky way ( van der kruit 1984 ) , and is similar to the 250 ev gas surrounding the galactic disk observed by snowden et al .",
    "we expect the gas to have @xmath31 ( using anders and grevesse 1989 abundances ) following cen and ostriker ( 2006 ) and rasumssen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and since similar metallicity is found in the hot intracluster medium even towards the virial radius of distant galaxy clusters ( maughan et al .",
    "2008 , anderson et al .",
    "2009 ) . in computing the electron density of the halo ,",
    "we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the strongest constraint we can derive for the hot halo around the galaxy comes from the dispersion measure ( dm ) of pulsars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . the dm is defined as + @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the distance to the pulsar and @xmath36 is the free electron density along the line of sight .",
    "the galactic free electrons ( primarily from the so - called `` warm ionized medium '' , or `` wim '' ) have been modeled as an exponential disk by , e.g , gaensler et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . integrating over this disk out to the lmc ( and assuming a distance of 50 kpc from the sun ) , we estimate the galactic wim contributes about 47 @xmath37 pc to the dm of pulsars in the lmc . in a survey of the magellanic clouds , manchester et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measured the dm of 11 pulsars in the direction of the lmc .",
    "three pulsars have dms below 47 @xmath37 pc ( the values are 26,28 , and 45 @xmath37 pc ) , suggesting these sources are located within the galaxy and randomly superimposed in front of the lmc .",
    "the next - lowest dms for lmc pulsars are 66 , 69 , and 73 @xmath37 pc , which leads to a conservative estimate of @xmath38 @xmath37 pc for the minimum dm introduced by the free electrons towards the lmc .",
    "this is also consistent with the lowest dms for pulsars in the same survey towards the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) : 70 and 76 @xmath37 pc .    subtracting 47 @xmath37 pc of galactic electrons",
    "leaves 23 @xmath37 pc of electrons from other sources .",
    "the lmc has an ionized halo that may be responsible for much of this excess dm .",
    "one can assess the amount of ionized gas from the high - ionization absorption lines , such as ovi and civ .",
    "the column densities of these ions in the lmc are comparable to the milky way ( howk et al . 2002 ) . considering that the metallicity is lower in the lmc , the inferred electron column is likely to be greater than that of the milky way .",
    "this implies that only a fraction of the excess dm is due to an ambient medium along the line of sight toward the lmc .",
    "however , since we do not know precisely the position of the lmc pulsars within its halo , in order to keep our estimate as conservative as possible we neglect the lmc electrons and assign all 23 @xmath37 pc of excess dm to the hot halo of the milky way .    with an lmc distance of 50 kpc , 23 @xmath37",
    "pc corresponds to an average electron density between the sun and the lmc of @xmath39 @xmath37 .",
    "if the entire halo had this mean density out to the virial radius , it would contain @xmath40  all of the missing baryons .",
    "this is an unphysical profile , however .",
    "we instead consider the standard assumption of an nfw profile for the missing baryons , with a concentration of 12 ( klypin , zhao , and somerville 2002 ) , and find a halo obeying this profile and the dm constraint would have a mass of @xmath41 , which is only 4% of the missing baryons from the galaxy .",
    "however , since the galactic electrons have a scale length of @xmath42 kpc ( gaensler et al .",
    "2008 ) , we might reasonably argue that baryons within a few scale lengths are galactic , not missing baryons .",
    "we therefore also consider an nfw profile with an inner truncation radius of 10 kpc , which is five scale lengths and therefore a very conservative estimate .",
    "such a profile would have a mass of @xmath43 , or just 5% of the missing baryons from the galaxy .    as a consistency check",
    ", we compute the cooling time of this halo , using our halo temperature and metallicity with the cooling function of sutherland and dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "our model assumes a stable halo , but we find the halo is probably not quite stable against cooling over a hubble time . for @xmath44 @xmath37 ( the upper limit on the average gas density out to the lmc ) , the cooling time is @xmath45 gyr . for the above nfw profile , then , @xmath46 ( 40% of the total hot halo gas mass ) will cool within the age of the galaxy and re - accrete onto the disk . to maintain self - consistency ,",
    "the constraints above must be treated as upper limits on an even more rarefied halo , or there must be continuous re - heating of the halo gas by a wind or some other mechanism .",
    "we can compare the constraints on the galactic hot halo from lmc pulsars to other constraints derived using a variety of methods . for reference ,",
    "the dm upper limit on the electron density at @xmath47 kpc is @xmath48 @xmath37 for an nfw halo , or @xmath49",
    "@xmath37 if we truncate the profile at @xmath50 kpc .",
    "our first comparison is to the result of stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who used 21 cm observations of the magellanic streams to measure the radius and velocity width of clumps of neutral gas in the streams . from these measurements",
    ", they derive the internal pressure of the clumps , and equate this to the gas pressure of the hot halo ( making the assumption that the clumps are confined entirely by gas pressure , and neglecting magnetic and turbulent pressure ; this is therefore probably an upper limit on the gas pressure ) .",
    "they assume a halo temperature of @xmath51 k ; for our higher temperature of @xmath52 k , the inferred upper limit on the hot halo electron density is @xmath53(45 kpc)@xmath54 @xmath37 - consistent with the above constraint .",
    "we also consider high velocity clouds , using uv measurements of the temperature and density of numerous partially - ionized metals and inferred gas pressures ( fox et al .",
    "this analysis suffers from a size - distance degeneracy , however , and so fox et al .",
    "perform their analysis for several potential cloud distances .",
    "the lower distance ( 10 kpc ) yields a lower upper limit , and the higher distance ( 100 kpc ) yields a higher upper limit , but they seem to prefer a distance of 50 kpc based on a tentative association of some of these clouds with the magellanic stream . using this distance and converting to our halo temperature , the upper limits on the electron density at this radius are approximately @xmath55 @xmath37 .",
    "we also estimate density using the emission measure of the hot halo , as measured by kuntz and snowden ( 2000 ) .",
    "they decompose the rosat soft x - ray background into components , tentatively identifying the harder emission from an unidentified component as the hot halo of missing baryons .",
    "this emission has a temperature of about @xmath56 k , close to our estimate of the hot halo temperature , and it appears to have a fairly uniform distribution across the sky .",
    "there is also a softer background component with a temperature of @xmath57 k , but this temperature is too cool to remain in a hot halo out to the virial radius , and its spatial distribution is not isotropic : it follows the galactic disk .",
    "the hotter component of the galactic x - ray background has a best - fit emission measure of @xmath58 @xmath59 pc , for an assumed solar - metallicity gas .",
    "this corresponds to an nfw hot halo of total mass @xmath60 ( 1.0% of the missing baryons from the galaxy ) , or a truncated nfw halo of mass @xmath61 ( 1.4% of the missing baryons ) . using our assumed metallicity of @xmath62",
    ", we recalculated the emissivity using the xspec utility with an apec model ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) and all other parameters matched to the observations in kuntz and snowden ( 2000 ) , which makes these halo masses increase by 190% .",
    "the corrected halo masses match very closely with the previous constraints : @xmath63 ( 2.0% of the missing baryons ) for an nfw halo , @xmath64 ( 2.6% of the missing baryons ) for a truncated nfw halo .",
    "this halo has a cooling time larger than 10 gyr for @xmath65 kpc ( no truncation ) or @xmath66 kpc ( with truncation ) .",
    "we summarize all of these constraints in table 1 .",
    "upper limits on the total hot halo mass , electron density at a radius of 50 kpc , and fraction of the missing baryons from the galaxy in the halo , are computed for each constraint .",
    "the ranges on some parameters reflect ranges in the original constraint combined with fits to both a truncated and a non - truncated nfw profile .",

    "blitz and robishaw ( 2000 ) measure hi mass for the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group , and use these masses to place upper limits on the amount of ram - pressure stripping that these galaxies could have experiences .",
    "this leads to an upper limit on the density of the local group intragroup medium , corresponding to @xmath92 @xmath37 .",
    "the galactic hot halo must be denser then the ambient medium around it , so this figure also serves as a strict lower limit on the density of the hot halo .",
    "our picture of the milky way hot halo is therefore a halo obeying an nfw profile , and containing several @xmath93 @xmath68 of material .",
    "it extends out to at least 50 kpc , although its density declines to the igm density by a radius of 80 kpc or so .",
    "such a halo is fully consistent with all of the constraints we have identified , but it does not contain more than a few percent of the missing baryons from the galaxy .",
    "the previous techniques will not work for constraining the haloes of most other galaxies , since we can not measure the dm of distant extragalactic pulsars , and even if we could , we can not reliably separate the dispersion from intergalactic electrons from the dispersion caused by the galaxy s halo of missing baryons .",
    "however , the integrated column density of free electrons from the hot haloes still will have a measurable effect in other galaxies through ovii absorption features along quasar sightlines .    at the temperatures of the haloes around large galaxies ( a few hundred ev ) ,",
    "intergalactic oxygen exists in the highly ionized ovii or oviii states , of which the former can be detected through its 21.60 @xmath94 k@xmath6 absorption line if superimposed in front of a bright background x - ray source .",
    "zero - redshift ovii absorption has been detected several times , and attributed variously to the local group igm ( nicastro et al .",
    "2002 , rasmussen , kahn , and paerels 2003 ) or to a hot halo around the milky way ( wang et al . 2005 ,",
    "fang et al .",
    "2006 , bregman and lloyd - davies 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the local detections , there are a few published claims of nonlocal ovii absorption lines ( mathur , weinberg , and chen 2003 , nicastro et al .",
    "2005b , buote et al . 2009 ) , but these have yet to yield any significant constraints ( see , e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "one successful approach comes from a statistical argument by fang et al .",
    "they studied 20 active galactic nucleus ( agn ) sightlines without any detections of nonlocal ovii absorption and argued based on the number density of l@xmath0 galaxies and of local group - sized galaxy groups that most of the missing baryons must be restricted to haloes around the former ; if these haloes extended to megaparsec scales , it would be statistically unlikely ( @xmath95 ) not to have seen them in ovii absorption .",
    "we extend this result by examining observations along specific sightlines , and broadening the search to galaxies smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "we select critical sightlines with the best combination of redshift interval and high signal - to - noise observations discussed by fang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and count the intervening galaxies along the sightline , focusing on the twelve agn that fall within the coverage of the sloan digitial sky survey ( sdss ) seventh data release ( abazajian et al . 2009 ) . for each of these twelve sightlines , we searched the sdss archive for foreground galaxies whose virial radii overlapped the sightline .",
    "if such a galaxy is present , but no ovii absorption is detected at its redshift , then we can place an upper limit on the ovii column from the galaxy .",
    "we searched within a @xmath97 region around each agn for sdss galaxies with photometric redshifts less than the agn s redshift .",
    "we also found a known lyman-@xmath6 absorption line at each of these photometric redshifts to help verify the photometric redshifts ; see table 2 .",
    "the photometric redshift was used to compute the distance to each galaxy and the angular distance between each galaxy and the agn sightline .",
    "the virial radius for each galaxy was estimated , and galaxies were selected whose virial radii were larger than their distance to the agn sightline .",
    "we inferred the virial radius by computing the sdss g - band galaxy luminosity and assuming a scaling relation between luminosity and virial radius , normalized to the milky way ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 kpc ) .",
    "we consider two forms for the scaling relation .",
    "the first , ( scaling relation a ) , is based on empirical scaling between the baryon fraction ( taken to be a proxy for luminosity ) and the total mass of a galaxy ( mcgaugh 2000 , dai et al .",
    "2010 ) : @xmath100 , so @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this seems to represent the data over many orders of magnitude in galaxies with disk components ( mcgaugh et al .",
    "2005 ) . for elliptical galaxies , the well - established `` tilt '' in the fundamental plane ( e.g. tortora et al",
    ". 2009 ) has the baryon fraction scaling in the opposite direction with mass : @xmath103 , so @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( scaling relation b ) .",

    "for the former , we apply scaling relation b , and for the latter we apply scaling relation a to estimate the virial radius .    using this technique , out of our sample of twelve sightlines",
    "we find three with nearby galaxies whose virial radii encompass the sightline : 3c273 ( @xmath109 ) , q1821 + 643 ( @xmath110 ) , and ton 1388 ( @xmath111 ) . for each intervening galaxy ,",
    "the mass and the baryon fraction are estimated , as well as the expected mass in missing baryons .",
    "we assume these baryons are distributed in a halo around the galaxy , extending to the virial radius , and that they obey an nfw density profile ( using several values for the concentration parameter between c=9 and c=17 , as in klypin , zhao , and somerville 2002 ) .",
    "the expected electron column contributed by each galaxy is computed by integrating along the agn sightline as it passes through the halo .",

    "( 2006 ) . for each sightline",
    ", they provide the expected width of a @xmath113 detection of ovii absorption , from which we compute the ovii column that would produce this line using n(o vii ) = @xmath114 ew , where n is in @xmath115 and ew in m@xmath94 ( bregman and lloyd - davies 2007 ) .",
    "the electron column is estimated from the oxygen column by adapting the conversion derived by bregman and lloyd - davies ( 2007 ) : + @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the o vii ion fraction ( we use @xmath118 ) and assuming gas of @xmath119 . this yields @xmath120 , the minimum ( threshold ) electron column that can be detected at @xmath113 using ovii absorption .",
    "these assumptions are conservative .",

    "this is probably a low estimate since hot intracluster medium gas typically has a metallicity of about @xmath119 , even towards the virial radius of distant galaxy clusters ( maughan et al .",
    "2008 , anderson et al .",
    "for both @xmath117 and z , choosing less conservative values reduces @xmath123 , which would imply even stronger expected detections than those listed in table 2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these two galaxies are similar in mass , but very different in composition .",
    "ngc 4138 is a bulge - dominated lenticular galaxy with 91% of its baryons in stars .",
    "ngc 4183 is a late - type disk galaxy with only 31% of its baryons in stars ( the other 69% are in gas ) .",
    "our sample contains more extreme cases of both gas - rich and gas - poor galaxies than these , but these two present a useful contrast in both gas fraction and galaxy type , with little difference in total mass . since ngc 4138 has such a high stellar fraction and such a prominent bulge , it must have been able to use its agn and its supernovae to produce a significant galactic wind and drive out more of its baryons than ngc 4183 , and yet the latter has a smaller baryon fraction than the former .",
    "more quantitatively , if we assume a negligible smbh in ngc 4183 and assume its @xmath124 of stars has produced @xmath125 supernovae explode in a core - collapse supernova , and applying a 20% correction ( mannucci et al .",

    "( 1 ) , we calculate ngc 4183 is missing @xmath126 of baryons , so each supernova needs to heat and eject @xmath127 from the galaxy .",
    "it already requires @xmath128 of the supernova energy ( i.e. , @xmath129 erg ) to heat @xmath127 to the virial temperature of ngc 4183 , and a comparable amount of energy to drive this material up into a halo from the gravitational potential of the disk , for a total supernova energetic efficiency of 350% ( or more , if cooling is included ) .",
    "these extreme efficiencies may pose a problem even for momentum - driven winds , and this leads to our suggestion that the classical picture of agn- and supernova - driven winds is incomplete for explaining the missing baryon problem .",
    "there exists one significant modification to the standard picture of hot haloes that must be considered .",
    "significant pre - heating of the baryons can lead to excess entropy in the halo gas , which causes it to deviate from the dark matter nfw profile and obey a flatter density profile instead ( e.g. mo and mao 2002 , kaufmann et al .",

    "this limit is dramatically weaker compared to the nfw upper limit of about 5% . on the other hand ,",
    "the pressure confinement constraints based on high velocity clouds and magellanic stream clouds place an upper limit of @xmath1 of the missing baryons ( @xmath132 ) , which still fails to resolve the second missing baryon problem . a flattened profile containing all the missing baryons",
    "also violates the em measurement of kuntz and snowden ( 2000 ) .",
    "they measured an em of @xmath58 @xmath59 pc ( which becomes approximately @xmath133 @xmath59 pc for our assumed metallicity ) , while the flattened halo would have an em of @xmath134 @xmath59 pc .",
    "thus the picture we described in section 3.2 remains - the galaxy has a limited hot halo of some form that declines to the igm density , but it does not contain most of the missing baryons from the galaxy .",
    "the extragalactic emission measure constraint ( x - ray surface brightness ) is also significantly affected by a flatter profile .",
    "kaufmann et al .",
    "claim their profile lowers the x - ray luminosity of the inner region of the halo by a factor of @xmath135 .",
    "we computed the emission measure for the flattened power - law profile ( figure 5 ) and indeed found the em lowered by a factor of 70 - 300 at the edge of the thick disk .",
    "however , the emissivity of the gas per unit mass increases , by about 75% , because the flattened profile is hotter than the nfw profile .",
    "finally , since the slope of the profile is flatter , the emission can remain significant out to larger radii .",
    "the result of these combined effects is that the emission from within the disk is lowered significantly , but the emission remains flatter , so at larger radii it is still visible .",
    "as figure 5 shows , smaller galaxy haloes are not detected , but a milky way - sized galaxy would still have a halo detectable out to 70 kpc or so , and a larger galaxy would have a hot halo visible to even larger radii . searching for x - ray emission at significant fractions of the virial radius around large , isolated disk galaxies",
    "is therefore a good way to constrain these flattened profiles .",
    "this claim differs from the conclusions in kauffmann et al .",
    "they argue that the surface brightness of their high - entropy halo is consistent with observations , while we argue the emission from such a halo should be detectable tens of kpc away from the galaxy disk .",
    "this distinction is primarily due to different assumptions about the baryon fraction .",
    "they initialize their models 10 gyr ago with a baryon fraction @xmath136 , while we assume galaxies form with the cosmological baryon fraction @xmath137 .",
    "this gives our halo a density 1.7 times larger than theirs , which yields a factor of three in the emission measure .",
    "correcting for this effect reconciles our respective predictions with each other , although we disagree on the interpretation . to understand the second missing baryon problem",
    ", however , one must begin with the cosmological baryon fraction , and then explain the fate of all the baryons originally associated with the galaxy over cosmic time ; thus we argue that flattened density profiles do not hide all of the missing baryons from galaxies .",
    "the flattened profiles are still detectable through their ovii absorption as well . at large fractions of the virial radius ,",
    "a flattened profile has a higher density compared to an nfw profile , so sightlines that only pass through a small section of the hot halo produce larger absorption lines if the profile is flatter .",
    "sightlines that pass closer to the central galaxy produce roughly equivalent sightlines to the nfw halo .",
    "we computed the absorption lines expected for our seven absorbers , and displayed the results in table 2 above . in the former regime ,",
    "the small @xmath138 detections predicted for nfw haloes increased moderately if the profile was flatter and the @xmath139 detections became roughly @xmath113 detections . in the latter regime ,",
    "the two large @xmath140 detections both decreased slightly . since a @xmath113 absorption line could be observable",
    ", the flattened density profiles do not seem to solve the ovii absorption issue , and actually make the problem worse .",
    "in general , flattened profiles can contain a larger fraction of the missing baryons from galaxies than nfw profiles .",
    "for the milky way , a flattened profile can meet the lmc pulsar dm constraint with up to 58% of the missing baryons in the hot halo instead of 5% , although the pressure constraints bring this figure down to 6 - 13% .",
    "the x - ray emissivity argument constrains the mass of these haloes around other large galaxies to about 59% of the missing baryons from these galaxies .",
    "this is a factor of three more mass than the nfw profile can hold without violating surface brightness limits .",
    "the ovii argument also limits the mass of these haloes in the same way it limits the mass of nfw haloes , with an independent upper limit of about 70% on the fraction of the missing baryons that can reside in the halo .",
    "flattened haloes are therefore an improvement , but they do not seem to be a perfect solution .    if the halo is driven from the galactic disk by a superwind , then the energetics problem we highlighted still applies .",
    "the flattened profile puts some additional constraints on the wind , however . in kaufmann",
    "2009 ) , the high entropy that keeps the profile flat is assumed to be injected at redshift 2 or 3 .",
    "this pushes back the energetics problem 10 gyr or so , but still does not quite resolve it . on the other hand ,",
    "if the halo has existed in its present form for 10 gyr , perhaps the gas simply never fell into the disk in the first place .",
    "we will discuss this idea further in the conclusion .",
    "the above arguments place separate and independent constraints on the baryons around galaxies .",
    "these arguments lead us to two general conclusions :    first , the majority of the missing baryons from spiral galaxies do not lie in hot haloes around these galaxies .",
    "for the milky way , the combination of observed constraints suggests that the common assumption of a hot halo of missing baryons obeying an nfw density profile with a concentration of 12 can only hold 2 - 3% of the baryons missing from the galaxy .",
    "the emission measure of theoretical haloes places an upper limit of 11 - 24% on the fraction of the missing baryons that can reside in similar hot haloes around other large galaxies .",
    "the analysis of o vii sightlines constrains hot haloes around a wider mass range of galaxies .",
    "the free electrons in these haloes should be detected through o vii absorption in the spectra of several strong background x - ray sources .",
    "this absorption has not been observed , so the column must be several times smaller than the prediction .",
    "this would occur if the halo has a radius of @xmath141 kpc or if its mass is reduced by factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "the former case leads to further difficulties .",
    "the density would be 0.01 - 0.1 @xmath37 , so the halo would cool quickly and should be far too bright in x - rays .",
    "the latter case is possible , but such a rarefied halo would not account for the missing baryons from galaxies .",
    "the proposal of hot haloes obeying flattened density profiles instead of nfw profiles was also considered . around the milky way , a typical flattened profile could hold @xmath1 of the missing baryons without violating any of our constraints .",
    "the emission measure of hot haloes with a flattened profile around other large disk galaxies sets an upper limit on the mass of about 59% of the missing baryons from these galaxies .",
    "the ovii constraint is approximately unchanged , which also limits the mass and extent of flattened density profiles .    collectively , these arguments rule out the existence of a large reservoir of hot gas around large galaxies that could account for the missing baryons .",
    "the most likely scenario is the presence of a small gaseous halo around @xmath96 galaxies containing @xmath142 and extending to a radius of 50 - 100 kpc .",
    "this picture also satisfies pulsar dm observations , measurements of the pressure around high - velocity clouds , and x - ray surface brightness constraints . if such a limited halo exists , it is not the primary reservoir of the missing baryons from galaxies .",
    "our second general conclusion is that galaxies do not expel their baryons primarily by galactic winds driven by supernovae or agn activity .",
    "we infer this from the lack of correlation between missing baryon fraction in galaxies and the stellar fraction or bulge mass in the galaxy .",
    "since the latter observables are taken to be proxies for the energy available in a galaxy from supernovae or from a supermassive black hole , the lack of correlation implies these energy sources do not explain the observed missing baryon fractions",
    ".    additionally , there are galaxies where most of the baryons are still gaseous yet they have the same missing baryon fraction as their counterparts where the baryons are nearly all in stars .",
    "to explain the baryon depletion of some of these star - poor , gas - rich galaxies , the energy required is several times that expected from galactic winds powered by supernovae .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to model the remaining mechanisms for resolving the second missing baryon problem , but we can comment on the possible solutions . based on our conclusions ,",
    "a straightforward way to account for the missing baryons from galaxies is if the baryons never fell into galaxies in the first place .",
    "this would require pre - heating before or just as the galaxy is forming .",
    "the most obvious source of non - gravitational energy at these times is early supernovae , whose contribution to heating would be much more effective in the epoch of protogalaxies ( when potential wells are shallow ) than it is today .",
    "these early supernovae could even come from the hypothetical `` population iii '' stars , which have the advantage of a top - heavy imf , so this process would not convert much of the missing baryonic mass into low - mass stars .",
    "if the missing baryons never accreted onto protogalaxies because of early supernova heating , there are several observable consequences in addition to resolution of the second missing baryon problem .",
    "these early supernovae pre - enrich gas in addition to pre - heating it , and this helps to explain phenomena like the g - dwarf problem and the `` floor '' in iron abundance noted in section 4 . for more discussion of this possibility ,",
    "see benson and madau ( 2003 ) .",
    "due to the top - heavy imf , they would have short lifetimes , so few of these early unbound stars would survive today , and the strict limits on intracluster light ( e.g krick and bernstein 2007 ) would not be violated . a top - heavy imf would also increase the efficiency per unit mass of metal production , which has further implications for the metallicity in galaxy clusters , as discussed in bregman , anderson , and dai ( 2010 ) .",
    "there are also observable constraints on this process .",
    "for example , if supernova heating is to prevent the baryons from accreting onto galaxies , the supernovae must occur before the galaxies form , i.e. @xmath143 . there is also an important period at @xmath144 when compton cooling can efficiently cool the baryons ( cen 2003 ) .",
    "depending on the details of the supernovae and the cosmology , the bulk of the early star formation and baryon expulsion might occur either before or after this period .",
    "more detailed observation and theoretical work can further constrain these possibilities .",
    "the remarkably tight correlation for galaxies between dark matter halo mass and baryon fraction seems to offer a powerful clue for understanding galaxy formation .",
    "the correlation persists over variations in star / gas mass ratio the mechanism and details of this connection remain unclear , however , and still need to be understood .",
    "further observations could also help to constrain more tightly the mass and extent of hot haloes around galaxies .",
    "direct imaging around large galaxies in soft x - rays could strengthen the surface brightness constraints .",
    "measurements of extragalactic pulsars or additional ovii lines could also provide useful constraints on the electron column density around galaxies .",
    "detailed examination of simulations could also be helpful , predicting , for example , the fraction of dark matter in the universe that falls into galactic haloes for comparison to the behavior of the baryons .",
    "finally , more modeling of galaxy formation could greatly assist in producing testable predictions that would differentiate between various solutions to this second missing baryon problem .",
