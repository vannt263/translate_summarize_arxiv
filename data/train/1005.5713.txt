    "relaxation processes in complex systems such as glass - forming liquids , polymeric melts , liquid crystals and even lipid membranes is a very active area of research  @xcite .",

    "these multiscale time relaxations suggest an accumulative effect of different elemental relaxation processes that can be associated with collective motions in the system  @xcite .",
    "the average effects of these cooperative mechanisms observed in experiments can be accurately described by means of well known empirical relations such as the williams - watts function in time space , or through its conjugated frequency domain ( havrilak - nagami ) function .",
    "these functions , and many others that can be found in the literature  @xcite , reflect the specific features of the micro- or mesoscopic relaxation dynamics of each system . the microscopic description of these features may involve the formulation of specific molecule - molecule interaction models that lead to particular results . in view of this",
    ", it seems important to have a general theoretical model able to cope with different relaxation processes that may describe , for example , the dielectric relaxation in diverse materials including solids , glass - forming liquids and polymer melts  @xcite . these last systems may exhibit , for example , anomalous kerr effect which can be described in terms of models based on fractional fokker - planck equations ( ffpe )  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we adopt a mesoscopic point of view for describing the relaxation of a system of non - interacting polar molecules inmersed in a time - dependent external electric field , because at this level of description it is still possible to formulate the mentioned general framework able to cope with different relaxation dynamics .",
    "in particular , we use the mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics ( mnet ) formalism in order to derive a non - markovian fokker - planck like equation ( nmfpe ) for the evolution of the probability distribution describing the orientation and position of the molecules .",
    "the mnet method uses the entropy produced by the system when it is driven out from equilibrium and is particularly useful for describing the stochastic evolution of systems at the mesoscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formalism lies in the fact that the nmfpe derived has a kinetic origin , and therefore there is no explicit assumption on the specific time correlation properties of the underlying gaussian stochastic process , contrary to what happens with equations derived from langevin formalisms @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "linear relations between generalized forces and fluxes occurring in phase space are postulated , which allow us to introduce memory effects accounting for the non - instantaneous response of the system to the external perturbations .",
    "the effects of the non - markovian dynamics on a measurable property of the system like its complex dielectric susceptibility can then be analyzed in a systematic way by considering different memory kernels . in this work",
    "we will concentrate mainly on memory kernels decaying as power laws .",
    "we will show that these particular functions turn out to be important since they lead to the mentioned ffpe .    in the section  ii we will derive the nmfpe for a system of non - interacting polar molecules by using mnet .",
    "this equation describes both rotational diffusion and the diffusion of polarization , and we will show that it can be recast into a ffpe when proper memory kernels are considered . in section  iii we will construct the equations for the first two moments of distribution .",
    "subsequently , in section  iv we will present a perturbation procedure which allow for a solution of the obtained dynamic equations , when the system is subjected to an external harmonic electric field superposed to a large static electric field .",
    "consequently , we will obtain a closed expression for the non - homogeneous dielectric susceptibility of the system which incorporates non - markovian effects , and the effects of the three first moments of the distribution function .",
    "these effects will be analyzed systematically in section  v by considering diverse limiting cases and memory functions .",
    "memory kernels decaying as power laws in time will be shown to generate ffpe and response functions of the cole - cole type  @xcite .",
    "a comparison with recent experimental results is performed to validate the models derived . in section",
    "vi we will propose a model based on a theory of distribution of relaxation times which can be used to give an insight of the physical processes producing power law kernels and , accordingly , ffpe .",

    "for convenience , in the following we will use the unit vector , @xmath4 , which represents the orientation of the molecular dielectric moment , and describe the system in terms of a single - molecule probability density .",

    "<S> mesoscopic non - equilibrium thermodynamics is used to formulate a model describing non - homogeneous and non - debye dielectric relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the model is presented in terms of a fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution of non - interacting polar molecules in contact with a heat bath and in the presence of an external time - dependent electric field . </S>",
    "<S> memory effects are introduced in the fokker - planck description through integral relations containing memory kernels , which in turn are used to establish a connection with fractional fokker - planck descriptions . </S>",
    "<S> the model is developed in terms of the evolution equations for the first two moments of the distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are solved by following a perturbative method from which the expressions for the complex susceptibilities are obtained as a functions of the frequency and the wave number . </S>",
    "<S> different memory kernels are considered and used to compare with experiments of dielectric relaxation in glassy systems . for the case of cole - cole relaxation , we infer the distribution of relaxation times and its relation with an effective distribution of dipolar moments that can be attributed to different segmental motions of the polymer chains in a melt . </S>"
