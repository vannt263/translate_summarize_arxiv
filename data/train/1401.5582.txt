    "in wireless networks with multiple user nodes , concurrent transmissions give rise to competition for channel resources between multiple information flows .",
    "how to deal with interference caused by concurrent transmissions is they key to understand the fundamental capacity limit of wireless networks . among a variety of interference management schemes ,",
    "recently , a new multiplexing technique called _ interference alignment _ was proposed to study the degrees of freedom ( dof ) of communication networks @xcite .",
    "while many interference alignment schemes have been designed for a wide variety of multiuser networks , the central common insight is to align interference as much as possible , while the desired signal of each receiver can still be distinguishable .",
    "so far , the dof characterizations available are almost for one - way communication networks , i.e. , each node in the network either sends or demands messages , but not both .",
    "however , in general communication networks , most user nodes are likely to both send and demand messages . in contrast to one - way networks ,",
    "such a class of communication networks are referred to as multi - way networks . for multi - way communication networks ,",
    "channel capacity , or even the dof characterizations , remain widely open .      for multi - way communication networks , recently lee _ et .",
    "_ studied the dof of a 3-user mimo @xmath4 channel in @xcite where each user equipped with 2 antennas sends one independent message to each of the other user nodes via the help of a 3-antenna relay only , and there are no direct links between any two user nodes . while their achievable scheme can achieve 1 dof per message , i.e. , 2 dof per user , which is the single - user dof upper bound , what is interesting is the new idea of _ alignment for network coding_. specifically , they first designed linear beamforming vectors at each user , so that every two pairwise symbols , i.e. , the symbols of two pairwise users , each sending to and demanding from the other , are aligned along the same vector at the relay . after receiving the signal ,",
    "the relay is able to resolve the 3 linear combinations , each of which is the sum of two pairwise symbols .",
    "afterwards , they applied a reciprocal approach to design beamforming vectors at the relay and each user , so that each user finally only sees two linear combinations , each of which is the sum of one of its desired symbols and one of its own transmitted symbols .",
    "since each user s own symbols are available at itself as side information , it can subtract the signal carrying its own symbols to obtain an equivalent clean single - user channel , and then to decode its desired symbols .",
    "thus , the phrase of alignment for network coding essentially means signal alignment at the relay and network coding at each user for decoding .",
    "regarding the idea of alignment for network coding in @xcite , we are interested in the question whether we can directly apply it to the setting with more than 3 users .",
    "to simply the problem as much as possible , we consider a symmetric but general setting where there are 4 @xmath0-antenna users , each sending one independent message to each of the others via an @xmath1-antenna relay only , and there are no direct links between any two users , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 can take arbitrary positive integers . we will study the symmetric dof per message of this network",
    ". actually , this problem is challenging for two reasons .",
    "first , since @xmath5 can take arbitrary values , every two users may have not project a common intersection at the vector space at the relay . in the signal alignment terminology",
    ", it implies that _ one - to - one alignment _ is impossible , and we have to use _ one - to - many alignment _ , by meaning that one symbol lies in the subspace _ jointly _ spanned by many other symbols .",
    "however , it is quite challenging to design an efficient achievability scheme .",
    "second , as we will explain later , for every user , the number of interfering messages increase from 2 in the 3-user setting to 6 in this work .",
    "thus , identifying the complex interplay between the subspaces at the relay carrying each message is quite interesting and nontrivial .      of the vast amount of literature on beyond one - way relay interference networks ,",
    "the most closely related to this work are references @xcite . in particular , following the idea of alignment for network coding in @xcite , the dof of several multi - way networks were studied in @xcite .",
    "however , they all only tackled with networks with special number of antennas , so that the signals carrying every two pairwise symbols can be aligned along the same vector at the relay .",
    "thus , their results , requiring one - to - one alignment only , are established in a relatively straightforward manner . in the absence of one - to - one alignment , wang _",
    "_ studied the dof of the 2-pair and 3-pair two - way relay mimo interference channel @xcite , based on the idea of inter - pair signal subspace alignment .",
    "compared to @xcite , this work also needs one - to - many alignment .",
    "however , since the total number of messages increase from 6 in @xcite to 12 in this work , how to identify the interplay between the subspaces projected from each user at the relay , and thus the dof characterizations become much more challenging . in @xcite ,",
    "chaaban _ et .",
    "_ characterized the dof of a general 3-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel , on the top of the particular model in @xcite , where each node is equipped with arbitrary number of antennas .",
    "however , for this channel , again , one - to - one alignment is sufficient to achieve the dof upper bound . regarding the problem we study in this paper , recently , yuan _ et .",
    "al . _ showed an achievable dof result in @xcite , essentially based on the idea of inter - pair signal subspace alignment in @xcite .",
    "however , their result is the dof achievability only , and it is not clear whether their result is tight , thus leaving this problem still open in general .      in this paper",
    ", we show that the symmetric dof value per message is piecewise linear depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 alternatively . to establish this result ,",
    "we provide both the information theoretic dof converse and the dof achievability .",
    "while our dof converse is established for every @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the dof achievability relying on linear signal vector alignment is established in the spatially - normalized sense in general .",
    "we remind the reader that the similar observations were also illustrated in @xcite for studying the dof of the 3-user mimo interference channel . however , as we will explain in detail later , the ideas behind both the dof converse and the dof achievability appear to be different . as a byproduct of this work , we also study the dof of a two - way relay mimo @xmath3 channels , and we present the dof result in the similar piecewise linear type .",
    "the key to establish the new results of this work is _ how to design an efficient scheme using the idea of inter - user signal subspace alignment for network coding_. compared to the recent work @xcite where only the achieved dof are presented , we provide both the information theoretic dof upper bound and the dof inner bound . in particular , we show that the result in @xcite is not tight when @xmath6 , by identifying a gap between their achieved dof and the upper bound developed in this work , and further closing the gap with a new achievable scheme .",
    "for example , consider the network @xmath7 , which is also the most interesting case for this work .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that each message can achieve @xmath8 dof .",
    "however , we show in this paper that each message can achieve 1 dof , which are also the information theoretic dof upper bound .",
    "we believe that our contribution is interesting for three reasons .",
    "first , as mentioned earlier in this section , the open problem studied in this paper has attracted much attention these years , and finally we settle this problem in this work .",
    "second , as we explain in this paper , for both the dof converse and the dof achievability , we essentially translate the original network to a one - way one - hop channel , from the users to the relay , by imposing additional constraints at the relay .",
    "contrary to conventional one - hop one - hop channels where every message is either undesired or desired but not both at a receiver , in this work , since all communication must pass through the relay , every message is both desired ( to its desired decoder ) and undesired ( to other decoders ) at the relay .",
    "thus , the imposed additional constraints at the relay , is the key to formulate the multi - way relay network to a one - way one - hop channel , which provides a lens to study the dof of multi - way relay networks .",
    "finally , as all existing work on the feasibility of linear interference alignment are for one - way one - hop wireless networks , in this paper we also settle the feasibility of linear interference alignment for two multi - way relay mimo interference networks . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work establishing the feasibility of linear interference alignment if the network is beyond one - hop .",
    "consider a wireless network where there are 4 user nodes , each with @xmath0 antennas , and one relay node with @xmath1 antennas . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , each user @xmath9 sends one independent message @xmath10 to each of the other 3 users where @xmath11 via the help of the relay node only , and there are no direct links between any two users .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the @xmath13 channel matrix from user @xmath14 to the relay , and @xmath15 the @xmath16 channel matrix from the relay to user @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the channel coefficients are independently drawn from continuous distributions , and stay constant during the entire transmission once they are drawn .",
    "we also assume that global channel knowledge is available at every node in the network .",
    "notice that our results are valid regardless of whether the channel matrices @xmath12 and @xmath17 are identical or not for each user @xmath14 . in this work ,",
    "we assume that all the 5 nodes work in the full - duplex mode , i.e. , they can hear and transmit simultaneously due to normalization to time . ] .",
    "since the relay hears from all users , its received signal vector at time @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the complex - valued @xmath21 signal vector sent from user @xmath14 , the @xmath22 column vector @xmath23 represents the i.i.d .",
    "circularly symmetric complex additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the relay and @xmath24 . at the user node , each user hears from the relay only .",
    "thus , the received signal vector at user @xmath14 at time @xmath25 is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the complex - valued @xmath22 signal vector sent from the relay , the @xmath21 column vector @xmath28 represents the awgn and @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the transmitted signal vectors from all nodes @xmath30 satisfy the average power constraint @xmath31\\leq p$ ] for @xmath32 channel users .    in this work , we will study the dof of the following two settings :    * all the 12 messages are active , to form a 4-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel , which is a natural extension of the 3-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel .",
    "we refer to this case as the _ all unicast _ setting . * among the 12 messages , we set @xmath33 , to form a two - way relay mimo @xmath3 channel , because every user on both the left - hand - side and the right - hand - side sends one independent message to every user on the other side .",
    "we refer to it as the _ multiple unicast _ setting .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the symmetric rate of the message @xmath10 and the corresponding symmetric dof metric is denoted as @xmath35 . the rate and the dof definitions follow from their standard definitions in information theory .",
    "in addition , the definition of the spatially normalized dof metric , to avoid special channel structures and to keep generic channels for the dof achievability , is introduced in @xcite , and we omit it here to avoid repetition .",
    "basically , it means that we scale the number of antennas at each node by a factor @xmath36 so that the resulting dof value @xmath37 is an integer , much like @xmath36 symbol extensions over the time / frequnecy domains .",
    "based on all available results so far , from the dof perspective , dof normalization to spatial extensions ( without special channel structures ) , is similar to normalization to time / frequency ( with block diagonal structures ) .",
    "that is , scaling time / frequency / spatial resources for a network also scales its dof with the same factor .    _",

    "it can be seen that the dof value per message is piecewise linear depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 alternatively , which implies that there are antenna dimension redundancies at either each user or the relay node .",
    "recall that the similar observation was recently also made for the 3-user @xmath16 mimo interference channel by wang _ et.al . _ in @xcite .",
    "however , the tools used to obtain these results appear to be different . in @xcite , the dof achievability based on the new idea of subspace alignment chains ,",
    "only needs one - to - one alignment , and the length of subspace alignment chains depends on the values of @xmath5 only .",
    "when @xmath54 increases , we keep adding new symbols to subspace alignment chains one by one . in contrast , in this work , we have to use one - to - many alignment when @xmath54 falls into some regimes , and thus there does not exist the concept of subspace alignment chains .",
    "in particular , when @xmath54 increases , e.g. , from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , the type of the achievable scheme changes from one - to - many alignment to one - to - one alignment . while it is clear how to design an one - to - one alignment scheme , the most challenge of this work comes from how to design an efficient one - to - many alignment scheme which can achieve the dof upper bound .",
    "similar to @xcite , we conclude the antenna redundancies observations from fig .",

    "specifically , if and only if @xmath57 , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 include redundant antenna dimensions . if and only if @xmath58 , neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 contains any redundant dimensions .",

    "remark : _ we point out that the most interesting and nontrivial dof achievability at @xmath65 is essentially much simpler than the achievability at @xmath55 of the all unicast setting .",

    "as implied by lemma 1 , there are 4 linear pieces depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 alternatively .",
    "let us consider the regime @xmath73 first .",
    "since each user sends 3 messages and each user is equipped with @xmath0 antennas only , the total number of dof per user can not be larger the than single - user dof bound @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the dof per message are upper bounded by @xmath74 .",
    "next , we consider the remaining regimes sequentially .",
    "note that each user only hears from the relay , thus the received signal at each user is a degraded version of what the relay sends . since each user is able to decode its 3 desired messages with its 3 own messages as side information ,",
    "if a genie provides that side information to the relay , then the relay is able to decode the messages desired at that user as well . by doing so , the dof converse for the one - hop multiple access channel ( mac ) is also the dof converse the original two - hop channel .",
    "thus , we will use the genie - aided approach for the one - hop mac to establish the dof converse .      in order for the reader to understand the dof converse proof easily",

    "next , note",
    "that @xmath87 can be both decoded at user 3 where @xmath88 are available as side information . since @xmath89 are already provided by the genie at the relay , and @xmath78 can also be decoded first and thus again available at the relay , the relay is able to decode the messages @xmath87 as well .",
    "hence , @xmath87 contribute other @xmath90 dimensions .",

    "thus , all those 6 messages occupy a total of @xmath100 dimensions , so as to produce the desired dof upper bound .    in the following , we translate the linear dimension counting approach into the information theoretic statement .",

    "thus , these 3 messages contribute a total of @xmath85 dimensions , which have to be linearly independent with the interfering dimensions contributed by the rest 4 messages @xmath114 .",
    "note that @xmath115 both originate from user 2 and @xmath116 both originate from user 3 , and these two users do not project a common intersection at the @xmath1-dimensional vector space at the relay because of @xmath117 .",

    "then we consider the sum rate of the 3 messages desired at user 1 : @xmath148    next , consider the sum rate of the messages @xmath122 desired at user 4 : @xmath149    adding up ( [ eqn : y3ob1_s ] ) , ( [ eqn : y3ob2_s ] ) we obtain : @xmath150 where ( [ eqn : y3ob3_remov ] ) is obtained because by removing the contributions of @xmath125 and @xmath126 from @xmath128 , the relay only sees @xmath1 linear combinations of the signals @xmath130 , @xmath131 , i.e. , @xmath132 , @xmath133 sent from user 2 and user 3 subject to the noise .",
    "note that @xmath143 , the transmitted signal from user 3 , is projected into that common subspace .",
    "thus , from @xmath151 , the relay is able to reconstruct the signals @xmath132 and @xmath133 subject to the noise distortion .    finally , by rearranging ( [ eqn : y3ob3_rearrange ] )",
    "we have the following rate inequality : @xmath152 then dividing @xmath108 on both sides , and letting first @xmath109 and then @xmath110 , we obtain the desired dof upper bound @xmath153",
    "following from the antenna dimension redundancies argument mentioned in section [ sec : results ] , and as what we illustrated in @xcite , we again only need to first present the achievability schemes at the two points of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and then extend the dof achievability to other regimes by the use of spatial extensions .",
    "basically , the dof achievability at @xmath56 , reported in @xcite , is not very challenging due to the fact that only one - to - one alignment is sufficient . to see this , consider @xmath154 where each message carries 2 dof . since @xmath155 , every two users project a 2-dimensional common intersection at the relay .",
    "thus , each user sends each message so that every two pairwise messages occupy only 2 dimensions at the relay .",
    "since there are 6 pair of messages , the total number of dimensions occupied by all the 6 pairs is given by @xmath156 .",
    "that is , one - to - one alignment is sufficient in this case . for the regime @xmath157 , we can also use the same achievable scheme , in the sense of spatial extensions .",
    "in contrast with @xmath56 , the dof achievability at @xmath55 is much more challenging . in this section ,",
    "we are primarily interested in this case , and the other regimes @xmath158 and @xmath159 can then be covered by the same achievable scheme by using spatial extensions . as a remark",
    ", we emphasize here again that our dof achievability only relies on linear beamforming schemes . due to the reciprocity of linear schemes , and following from the prior work such as @xcite ,",
    "once we finish the transmitting beamforming design at each user and the receiving beamforming design at the relay in the first phase , then transmitting beamforming at the relay and receiving beamforming at each user if the second phase can be automatically determined by using a reciprocal approach . by doing so , each user finally sees an equivalent interference - free single - user mimo channel for each desired message .",
    "thus , the key of designing the dof achievability is the transmission design for the first phase , i.e. , from each user to the relay .      as mentioned in section [ sec : y_ob ] , the received signal at each user only depends on the transmitted signal at the relay . since each user is able to decode its desired messages , with its own transmitted messages as side information ,",
    "if that side information is available at the relay , then the relay is able to decode those messages as well .",
    "thus , from the dof achievability perspective , it does not affect whether the signals carrying the pairwise messages @xmath160 align or not at the relay , because @xmath97 is side information at user @xmath161 who demands @xmath98 , and @xmath98 is side information at user @xmath162 who demands @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the principle to design an achievability scheme is that _ for every pairwise messages @xmath163 , the signals carrying all the other messages occupy only @xmath164 dimensions at the relay , and the @xmath35 dimensions at the relay accommodating each message in the pair @xmath160 are linearly independent with those @xmath164 dimensions , so that the relay is able to resolve @xmath35 linearly independent combinations of the signals carrying @xmath160 only , subject to the noise . _      for this case",
    ", lemma 2 implies that each message can achieve @xmath166 dof , i.e. , each user can achieve a total of @xmath167 dof which are also the single - user dof upper bound .      in the first phase ,",
    "user @xmath14 encodes each symbol @xmath168 using a @xmath169 beamforming vector @xmath170 , and the transmitted signal vector of user @xmath14 , denoted as @xmath171 , can be written as @xmath172 now , let us consider the received signals at the relay node . note that there are a total of 12 symbols , comprising 6 pair of messages @xmath173 . as mentioned in the principle of the beamforming design in the first phase ,",
    "_ our goal is that for every two pairwise messages , the other 5 pairs of symbols , i.e. , the other 10 symbols , span @xmath174 dimensions only , and the signal vector carrying each symbol in that pair is linearly independent with those 6 dimensions , so that a linear combination of every two pairwise can be resolved at the relay .",
    "_ by doing so , in the second phase , the relay can precode the 6 linear combinations of pairwise symbols using beamforming , so that every user finally only sees 3 linear combinations , each of which is associated with one of its own symbols and one of its desired symbols . with this approach ,",
    "let us count the total number of alignment equations that we need .",
    "for every two pairwise symbols , we need to accommodate the other 10 symbols into a 6-dimensional subspace at the relay .",
    "that is , we need to align 4 symbols into the subspace spanned by the other symbols .",
    "since there are 6 pairs , the total number of alignment equations is given by @xmath175 .",
    "however , with such a counting approach , the associated 24 alignment equations could be linearly dependent with each other , and it is even not clear how to explicitly design each alignment equation .",
    "thus , such a counting approach may not help solve this problem very much .",
    "instead , let us let us consider necessary vector alignment from the user perspective . regarding every user , except for its 3 desired symbols and its 3 own symbols , the other @xmath176 interfering symbols constitute interference .",
    "thus , we need to ensure that at the relay , for each user , the 3 desired symbols occupy a 3-dimensional subspace , which has only null intersection with the subspace spanned by the 6 interfering symbols .",
    "for example , consider user 1 who desires the symbols @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , and its own transmitted symbols are @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 . except for these 6 symbols , the other @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188",
    "are 6 interfering symbols . in the @xmath189-dimensional space at the relay , in order to protect a @xmath167-dimensional subspace for the 3 desired symbols , the 6 interfering symbols sent from from user 2 , user 3 and user 4 can only occupy @xmath190 dimensions .",
    "that is , we need to align at least 2 of those 6 symbols into the subspace spanned by the other 4 symbols at the relay , implying that we need 2 alignment equations . following from a symmetric analysis ,",
    "if we consider user 2 , user 3 and user 4 , individually , we need a total of 8 alignment equations , 2 for each user .",
    "note that this is only a necessary requirement , and our achievability scheme finally must meet the goal we emphasized above .",
    "so far , we demonstrate that we need at least 8 alignment equations .",
    "however , it is still quite challenging to design an achievable scheme for two coupled reasons .",
    "* first , it is quite challenging to explicitly design the two alignment equations for each user .",
    "consider the 6 interfering symbols at the relay regarding user 1 as an example .",
    "note that @xmath183 , @xmath185 both originate from user 2 , @xmath184 , @xmath187 both originate from user 3 , and @xmath186 , @xmath188 both originate from user 4 .",
    "since @xmath191 , every two users do not project a common intersection at the relay .",
    "thus , finding the explicit two alignment equation by identifying which symbol is aligned into the subspace spanned by which symbols , is essentially quite important and very challenging .",
    "* second , as we will explain later , in fact , the 8 alignment equations are still linearly dependent , i.e. , some equations can be linearly represented by the others .",
    "thus , which alignment equations are redundant among the 8 alignment equations is nontrivial . to see this ,",
    "let us count the number of nulling equations and variables .",
    "since we need to design 12 @xmath169 beamforming vectors , there are a total of 36 variables we need to determine their values .",
    "also , each alignment equation at the relay contributes @xmath192 nulling equations .",
    "if all the 8 alignment equations , i.e. , @xmath193 nulling equations are linearly independent , then linear algebra implies that the beamforming vectors have to be zero . in order to have a non - zero solution , one necessary condition is that we must have fewer linearly independent nulling equations than the number of variables .",
    "thus , among the 56 nulling equations , at most there are @xmath194 linearly independent nulling equations .",
    "that is , there are at least 21 redundant nulling equations , or equivalently 3 redundant alignment equations .",
    "however , the question which 3 alignment equations are redundant is nontrivial .",
    "as mentioned above , since directly designing each alignment equation might be quite difficult , let us first consider the signal vectors at the relay carrying each symbol .",
    "we denote @xmath195 as 7 linearly independent @xmath196 column vectors .",
    "suppose that the three vectors carrying the 3 symbols of user 1 , i.e. , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , arrive at the relay along the following vectors : @xmath200 also , we suppose the 3 symbols of user 2 arrive at the relay along the vectors : @xmath201 the 3 symbols of user 3 arrive at the relay along the vectors : @xmath202 and the 3 symbols of user 4 at the relay along the vectors : @xmath203    as we will show the linear independencies among vectors @xmath195 later , let us first examine at the relay , for every symbols pair , the other 5 pairs , i.e. , 10 symbols , only span a @xmath204-dimensional subspace , and the vector carrying each symbol in that pair does not align into that @xmath204-dimensional subspace spanned by the other 5 pairs .",

    "following from the antenna dimension redundances intuition illustrated in section [ sec : results ] , section [ sec : y_ib ] and @xcite , it suffice to present the achievability at @xmath65 and @xmath290 . since the dof achievability at @xmath290 , similar to that for @xmath56 of the all unicast setting ,",
    "was already shown by xiang _",
    "_ in @xcite , we only study the most interesting and nontrivial case @xmath291 , and show that each message has @xmath166 dof , as implied by theorem [ thm : x ] .",
    "aggain , we only need to carefully design the achievability in the first phase , so that a clean linear combination of each pair of symbols can be resolved at the relay .    in the first phase ,",
    "each user @xmath14 encodes each symbol @xmath292 using a @xmath293 beamforming vector @xmath294 , and the transmitted signal vector of user @xmath14 can be written as @xmath295 note that there are a total of 8 symbols in this channel .",
    "similar to our analysis for @xmath7 of the all unicast setting , in this case , at least we need to ensure that for every user , except for its 2 desired symbols and its 2 own symbols , the signal subspace occupied by the other @xmath277 symbols has @xmath296 dimensions only . for example , consider user 1 who desires the symbols @xmath178 and @xmath179 , and its own transmitted symbols are @xmath181 and @xmath182 . except for these 4 symbols , the other 4 symbols @xmath183",
    ", @xmath185 @xmath184 and @xmath186 are interfering symbols . in the @xmath297-dimensional space at the relay , to protect a @xmath298-dimensional subspace for the 2 desired symbols",
    ", those 4 vectors carrying the 4 interfering symbols sent from from user 2 , user 3 and user 4 can only span @xmath167 dimensions .",
    "that is , we need to align one of those 4 vectors into the subspace spanned by the other 3 vectors at the relay . among those 4 symbols ,",
    "note that @xmath183 , @xmath185 both originate from user 2 .",
    "since @xmath191 , every two users do not project a common intersection at the relay .",
    "thus , we align align the vector carrying @xmath186 into the subspace spanned by the vectors carrying @xmath183 , @xmath185 and @xmath184 at the relay .",
    "that is , @xmath299 next , consider user 2 who desires the symbols @xmath184 and @xmath186 , and its own transmitted symbols are @xmath183 and @xmath185 .",
    "thus , the remaining 4 symbols @xmath181 , @xmath182 @xmath178 and @xmath179 are interfering symbols . in the @xmath297-dimensional space at the relay , in order to protect a @xmath298-dimensional subspace for the 2 desired symbols , we need to align one of the 4 vectors carrying those 4 symbols into the subspace spanned by the other 3 vectors at the relay .",
    "in particular , we align the vector carrying @xmath179 into the subspace spanned by the vectors carrying @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath178 at the relay .",
    "that is , @xmath300 with the similar analysis , for user 3 , we need one alignment equation regarding the 4 interfering symbols @xmath182 , @xmath185 @xmath179 and @xmath186 , and we let @xmath301    finally , for user 4 , again , we need another alignment equation regarding the 4 interfering symbols @xmath181 , @xmath183 @xmath178 and @xmath184 .",
    "however , after carefully observing the alignment equations ( [ eqn : xalign1 ] ) , ( [ eqn : xalign2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : xalign3 ] ) , we find that @xmath302 produces the following alignment equation : @xmath303 which implies that the vector carrying @xmath181 is automatically aligned into the subspace spanned by the vectors carrying @xmath183 @xmath178 and @xmath184 at the relay .",
    "that is , the equation ( [ eqn : xalign4 ] ) is redundant .",
    "next , we need to examine at the relay , for each pair of symbols , the other 6 symbols only occupy 4 dimensions , which are also linearly independent with the vector carrying each symbol in that pair .",
    "take the symbols pair @xmath206 as an example , it can be seen that the vectors carrying the other 6 symbols are indeed aligned into at most 4 dimensions subspace because two alignment equations ( [ eqn : xalign1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : xalign3 ] ) are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "what remains to be shown is that for @xmath311 and @xmath312 , each does not lie in the subspace occupied by the other 6 symbols . since the channel matrices and beamforming vectors are already available , it is easy to verify , and we omit the calculation here .",
    "in this section , we present the proof of theorem [ theorem : feasibility ] .",
    "for the 4-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel defined in section [ sec : system ] , theorem [ theorem : feasibility ] implies that the dof demand per user , @xmath35 , is feasible with linear interference alignment if and only if @xmath313 .",
    "since the upper bound follows directly from lemma [ lemma : y_ob ] , we only need to provide the achievability to show @xmath313 dof per message are achievable using linear beamforming schemes without the need for symbol extensions in time / frequency / space .",
    "as implied by theorem [ theorem : feasibility ] , the feasible dof value is again presented by four pieces , depending on either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "we will consider each regime individually .",
    "the idea behind the proof for the regime @xmath251 is based on reducing the number of antennas at each user and the relay to obtain a reduced network , to which we directly apply the achievable scheme designed for @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider the regime @xmath73 . in this regime ,",
    "our goal is to show that each message can achieve @xmath314 dof . to see this ,",
    "each message is encoded to @xmath314 independent symbols . at each user",
    ", we reduce the number of antennas from @xmath0 to @xmath315 . also , at the relay node , we reduce the number of antennas @xmath1 to @xmath316 .",
    "this can be done since @xmath317 and @xmath318 . by doing so ,",
    "we form a new 4-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel where each user has @xmath319 antennas , the relay has @xmath320 antennas and @xmath321 .",
    "thus , @xmath322 dof can be achieved , by the use of he achievable scheme that we present in section [ sec : y_ib ] by replacing each one - dimensional symbol with an @xmath323-dimensional symbol .",
    "next , consider the regime @xmath159 .",
    "our goal is to show that each message can achieve @xmath324 dof . to see this , each message is encoded to @xmath324 symbols . at the relay , we reduce the number of antennas from @xmath1 to @xmath325 . also , at each user node , we reduce the number of antennas @xmath0 to @xmath326 . again , this can be done due to the fact that @xmath317 and @xmath318 .",
    "hence , we form a new 4-user relay mimo @xmath4 channel where each user has @xmath319 antennas , the relay has @xmath320 antennas and @xmath321 .",
    "thus , @xmath327 dof can be achieved , by the use of the achievable scheme that we present in section [ sec : y_ib ] by replacing each one - dimensional symbol with an @xmath328-dimensional symbol .",
    "the idea behind the proof for the regime @xmath157 is based on reducing the number of antennas at the relay node only to obtain a reduced network , to which we directly apply the achievable scheme designed for @xmath56 .",
    "first , we consider the regime @xmath59 . in this regime ,",
    "our goal is to show that each message can achieve @xmath329 dof . to see this , each message is encoded to @xmath329 symbols . at the relay node , we reduce the number of antennas from @xmath1 to @xmath330 . since @xmath59",
    ", we must have @xmath331 as well .",
    "now , consider the number of common intersection projected from every two users , which is given by @xmath332 , implying that we can randomly pick @xmath333 dimensions in that common intersection , along which the two signals carrying the corresponding pairwise @xmath333 symbols per user are aligned",
