    "quantum frequency standards find a number of applications in fundamental science and applied technology . nowadays",
    "the unit of time ( si second ) is defined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation of the ground state hyperfine transition in @xmath2cesium  @xcite .",
    "cesium fountain primary frequency standards have reached an accuracy level of @xmath3  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the progress in atom cooling and trapping together with sub - herz linewidth lasers allows to develop more accurate frequency standards based on optical transitions in neutral atoms and ions .",
    "for example , an accuracy level evaluation for a neutral @xmath4sr optical lattice clock is @xmath5  @xcite , and the @xmath6al@xmath7 quantum logic frequency standard demonstrated an inaccuracy level of order of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "an interesting candidate for the role of an etalon transition in quantum frequency standards is the isomer transition in a nucleus of @xmath0thorium .",
    "this unique isotope has an extremely low - energy @xmath9th isomeric state , expected at an optical wavelength of about 165 nm . the creation of a quantum frequency standards based on this transition will open new possibilities for experimental studies of basic fundamental laws of physics .",
    "the question  are fundamental constants really constant \" is among them .",
    "it is shown that the amplification factor between the drift of the nuclear transition frequency @xmath10 and the drift of the fine structure constant @xmath11 has an absolute value between @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "hence the thorium quantum frequency standard will be several order of magnitude more sensitive to the possible drift of @xmath14 than existing standards based on the transitions in electronic shell of atoms or ions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : isomer ] we review current knowledge on the isomer transition energy and lifetime . in section  [ sec : possibilities ] we briefly discuss two main experimental approaches to the direct observation of the isomer transition : trapped ions and thorium - doped crystals . in section  [ sec : spectroscopy ]",
    "we describe fluorescence spectroscopy of our thorium - doped calciumflouride crystals and estimate the optical pumping rate .",
    "section  [ sec : future ] gives an outlook on future steps .",
    "the isomer transition energy in @xmath0th nucleus is currently known only from undirect measurements . in 1976 ,",
    "kroger and reich  @xcite studied the @xmath15-ray spectrum resulting from the decay of @xmath16uranium .",
    "they concluded that the @xmath0th nucleus has a @xmath17 isomer state lying within @xmath18 ev above the @xmath19 ground state level .",
    "the development of high quality germanium detectors ( resolution from 300 to 900ev ) allowed helmer and reich to measure more precise @xmath15-energies in 1989  1993 and to predict the energy of the nuclear transition to be @xmath20 ev  @xcite .",
    "this unnaturally low value triggered a multitude of investigations , both theoretically and experimentally , trying to determine the transition energy precisely , and to specify other properties of the @xmath17 excited state of @xmath0th ( such as lifetime and magnetic moment ) .",
    "however , direct searches for photon emission from the low - lying excited state have failed to observe a signal  @xcite . in 2005 , guimraes - filho and helene  @xcite re - analysed the old experimental data and reported @xmath21 ev .",
    "new indirect measurements with the most advanced x - ray microcalorimeter ( resolution from 26 to 30ev ) were performed by beck et.al in 2007  @xcite .",
    "they published a new value for the transition energy @xmath22 ev for the isomer nuclear transition , shifting it into the vacuum ultraviolet domain .",
    "this shift probably explains the failure in observing the transition in previous experiments . in 2009",
    "al . reanalyzed their results taking into account the non - zero probability of the @xmath23 transition rate ( estimated as 2% ) and published a revised version @xmath24 ev  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath24 ev is currently most accepted by the community but can not be considered definite untill the direct measurements are performed successfully .",
    "the dominant uncertainty in the prediction of beck et.al is connected with the value of the branching ratio @xmath25  @xcite from the 29.19 kev level to the ground state @xcite . estimation of this value vary in different works .",
    "sakharov  @xcite mentions two alternative values for this branching ratio : 25% in  @xcite which would result in @xmath26 ev and 51% in  @xcite leading to @xmath27 ev .",
    "while the direct measurement of the @xmath28 ultraviolet transition in @xmath0th is still not performed , the isomer state lifetime @xmath29 remains unknow .",
    "most recent estimations of the half life of the isomer state in a bare nucleus based on theoretical calculations of the matrix element of the magnetic moment for the transition between ground and isomer levels were performed in  @xcite .",
    "the theory was checked by comparison with experimental data for transitions at higher energies .",
    "they found the half - life of this transition @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is given in ev .",
    "this corresponds @xmath32 min for @xmath33 ev .    for a thorium atom or low charged ion",
    "the isomer lifetime can be significantly reduced . in work of tkalya",
    "@xcite it is predicted that the probability of spontaneous magnetic dipole emission in a transparent non - magnetic dielectric medium with refractive index @xmath34 is @xmath35 times higher than in vacuum .",
    "the reason for this factor is the renormalisation of the density of emitted photon states . for a caf@xmath36 crystal , @xmath37 at wavelength @xmath38 nm ( corresponding @xmath33 ev ) , which gives a reduction factor of 3.7 for the lifetime .",
    "a more significant lifetime reduction can be connected with electronic bridge and bound internal conversion effects , i.e. isomer state decay can be amplified by interaction between the nucleus and the electron shell .",
    "there are a number of theoretical calculations of electronic bridge processes . in an isolated neutral thorium atom",
    "the isomer state lifetime is about @xmath39s for @xmath40ev and about 4.5min for @xmath41ev  @xcite . in the th@xmath42 ion for",
    "@xmath40ev the lifetime remains the same if the valence electron is in the ground state , and decreases 20 times if the valence electron is in the metastable @xmath43 state  @xcite .",
    "similar calculations for the th@xmath44 ion which is most likely to occur in the solid - state approach have yet to be performed . in the th@xmath45 ion",
    "the lifetime decreases @xmath46 times for @xmath41 and @xmath47ev  @xcite , there is not sufficient data about the th@xmath45 ion spectrum to calculate the lifetime at @xmath33ev .",
    "experimental attempts to measure the @xmath9th lifetime were performed in  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are based on the theoretical prediction  @xcite that the @xmath14 decay rate for @xmath9th is 2 to 4 times higher than for the ground state and that the energy spectrum of the @xmath14 particles slightly differs for ground and isomer state .    in  @xcite thorium",
    "was electrodeposited onto a hollow cathode and then electronically excited by electric discharge . with some probability the excitation of the electronic shell",
    "was transfered to the nuclei  @xcite and therefore some amount of @xmath9th was obtained .",
    "after the end of the discharge the @xmath14 activity of the sample was monitored and @xmath14 counts with different energies were written to different channels to record a spectrum . it was shown that @xmath14 particles from thorium are well energy separated from those of thorium daughter products .",
    "the excitation and detection procedure was repeated several times and a decaying component with half - life @xmath48 min was observed in counts for @xmath14 particles emitted from thorium . in the same work",
    "also plots indicating a time dependence of count ratios for @xmath14 particles from daughter products are presented  @xcite .",
    "these plots demonstrate some time dependence higher than @xmath49 variation ( total number of counts is about 8000 per minute whereas the variation is about 300 per minute ) .",
    "this could indicate some technical artifact being responsible for the observed decay of the @xmath14 count rate from thorium .    in the work of kikunaga et.al",
    "@xcite a sample of @xmath16u was chemically purified from thorium , then it was left for 1h to allow the growth of @xmath0th in its ground and isomer state , then the thorium was extracted .",
    "the @xmath14 spectrum from this fresh thorium sample was recorded during the first 6000s and the following 6000s .",
    "they compared the @xmath14 counts in the region of 49154955kev , where the @xmath14 particles are produced in the decay of the @xmath9th isomer state with much higher probability than in the decay of the ground state .",
    "slightly more @xmath14 counts where detected for the first time interval and the authors derived @xmath50h with @xmath51 confidence .",
    "this experiment was not suited to measure half - lifes on the order of minutes because of the long chemical preparation process .",
    "in general the analysis of these experiments is further complicated by the presence of various chemical compositions of thorium with different decay rates depending on the chemical state ( mainly tho@xmath7 , th and th@xmath7 in  @xcite and hydroxide and chloride complexes in  @xcite ) . so far , no clear evidence for @xmath14 particles or photons originating from the @xmath9th isomer state has been presented .",
    "therefore both the energy and the half - life of the @xmath9th isomer state are still not determined definitely .",
    "there are several groups worldwide working towards a direct measurements of the thorium isomer transition .",
    "( t. schumm , institute of atomic and subatomic physics tu vienna , austria ; e. r. hudson , university of california , usa e. peik , ptb , germany ; m. chapman and a. kuzmich , georgia institute of technology , usa ) .",
    "the expected excitation energy of 7.8ev enforces work with thorium in an ionized state to avoid overwhelming optical response by the electron shell which would mask the nuclear signal .",
    "two main experimental directions are proposed .",
    "the first is the spectroscopy of thorium ions in ion traps  @xcite .",
    "the second is the _ solid - state nuclear spectroscopy _ , where thorium ions are implanted into a crystal ( such as caf@xmath36 or licaf ) transparent for vacuum ultraviolet light  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of solid - state nuclear spectroscopy is the possibility of simultaneously excitating a macroscopic number ( just a few orders of magnitude smaller than total number of atoms in a crystal ) of thorium nuclei whereas for ion trap spectroscopy this number is limited by @xmath52 .",
    "this high number facilitates the first search for the transitions compared to ion traps .",
    "the second advantage is the fact that the experimental setup does not require any bulky equipment for ion trap creation such as ultrahigh vacuum and laser cooling .",
    "however , the solid - state spectroscopy method is not free of additional difficulties connected with the hardly removable or irremovable systematic effects in a crystal . here ,",
    "trapped ions present a very clean system with well - controllable parameters , probably ultimately more relevant for the realization of a high - performance laboratory frequency standard .    in our study",
    "we plan to first perform low - resolution fluorescence spectroscopy using caf@xmath36 as a host crystal to find the transition with 1 nm precision .",
    "caf@xmath36 has a large ( more than 10ev ) band gap .",
    "th@xmath44 ions can replace ca@xmath53 ions in the crystal lattice ( ionic radii are 94pm for th@xmath44 and 114pm for ca@xmath53 ) , charge is compensated either by a ca vacancy or two f interstitials .    caf@xmath36 is not a good scintillator at the room temperature which is important as @xmath0th nuclei undergo @xmath14 decay with a half - life of @xmath54 years ( @xmath14 decay rate @xmath55s ) . according to  @xcite",
    ", the total time of a photon scintillation burst following an @xmath14 decay does not exceed 20@xmath56s .",
    "the scintillation decay constant for events caused by @xmath15 or @xmath57 ray accompanying most of the @xmath14 decays is 2 times longer therefore the total decay time @xmath58 should not exceed 50@xmath56s .",
    "@xmath0th has 8 short - living radioactive daughter elements .",
    "therefore the number @xmath59 of decays per second in the sample containing @xmath60 thorium nuclei with equilibrium number of daughter nuclei is about @xmath61 the scintillation will perturb the detection system during the part @xmath62 of data aquisition time .",
    "the requirement @xmath63 gives the upper limits for the total number of thorium nuclei in the sample : @xmath64 for @xmath65s .",
    "another important question concerns the position of possibly emerging electronic states connected with thorium impurities in the crystal .",
    "if there is a level with an energy near the isomer transition energy , it can increase the rate of isomer state decay via the electronic bridge process .",
    "this critical point is issue of ongoing theoretical and experimental work .",
    "low - resolution fluorescence spectroscopy is the first step towards an accurate determination of the exact energy and lifetime of the @xmath9th isomer state .",
    "[ fig : f1 ]    figure  [ fig : f1 ] shows a scheme of the planned spectroscopy experiment .",
    "we plan to irradiate the sample for a time @xmath66 with the probe radiation ( laser or synchrotron ) .",
    "we wait for a dead time @xmath67 to let the crystal fluorescence decay and then collect the fluorescence photons during time @xmath68 .",
    "scanning the frequency of radiation and analysing the obtained photon counts , we plan to find the frequency of the isomer transition .",
    "a recent study by the hudson group using the synchrotron radiation available at the advanced light source showed that typical relaxation time of crystal fluorescence ( not connected to the isomer decay ) for similar crystals ( licaf , lisaf nayf etc . ) doped with @xmath69th is less or about 1s  @xcite .",
    "we plan to perform similar measurements for @xmath69th - doped caf@xmath36 crystal using a high power laser system at the max born institute in berlin  @xcite .",
    "as long as the isomer state lifetime considerably exceeds the crystal fluorescence lifetime and the isomer transition lies within the band gap of caf@xmath36 it should be possible to determine the isomer transition energy using the solid - state approach .",
    "the number of photons detected from a spontaneous nuclear isomer decay is : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the total decay rate , @xmath72 is the optical pumping rate , @xmath73 is the radiative decay rate of the bare nucleus , @xmath34 is the refraction index , @xmath74 is the solid angle covered by the detector , @xmath75 is the detector efficiency .",
    "we now estimate the optical pumping rate @xmath72 . for the low - resolution spectroscopy stage",
    ", the spectrum of the radiation source will be broad and smooth , therefore @xmath72 depends only on the spectral power density @xmath76 of the radiation at the transition frequency @xmath77 .",
    "let us consider for the sake of simplicity the lorentzian spectral density of intensity : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the spectral linewidth of the source , @xmath80 is the spectral intensity density on resonance .",
    "th@xmath44 ion has a rn - like electronic shell ( noble gas ) with zero angular momentum and zero spin . in the following we neglect the structure of the electronic shell as well as higher levels of the th nucleus .",
    "ground and isomer state are degenerate with respect to projections @xmath81 and @xmath82 of angular momenta @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively ( here we neglect the interaction with ramdomly oriented spins of surrounding f nuclei ) . the magnetic field @xmath85 of the spectroscopy radiation can be represented as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 describes the random phase variations responsible for non - zero spectral linewidth @xmath79 .",
    "note that for the low - resolution spectroscopy @xmath88 just a few orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath90 in resonance approximation can be represented as @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the @xmath93th covariant component of @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the @xmath93-th contravariant component of the matrix element @xmath96 of the nucleus magnetic momentum operator in cyclic coordinates , @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 is the bare hamiltonian of the thorium nucleus , @xmath99 describing the interaction of the nucleus with all other fields except the spectroscopy radiation .",
    "we can choose a quantization axis , for example , along the radiation propagation direction , and classify excited states @xmath100 and ground states @xmath101 by angular momentum projection onto this axis .",
    "the set of equations for the density matrix @xmath102 in the rotating frame with relaxation terms reads as : @xmath103-\\gamma \\rho_{ee}+\\sum_{e'}\\gamma_{||}^{ee'}\\rho_{e'e ' } ; \\displaybreak[1 ] \\\\",

    "we can estimate @xmath104 and @xmath105 via the spin - spin relaxation time @xmath108s for caf@xmath36 @xcite .",

    "now we should calculate @xmath118 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we suppose that the radiation has a certain polarization along @xmath119th cyclic unit vector , so @xmath120 . in dipole approximation , @xmath121 . according the wigner - eckart theorem , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a reduced dipole moment",
