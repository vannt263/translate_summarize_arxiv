    "planetary transits in an exoplanetary system were first discovered in 1999 for the hd  209458 system @xcite@xcite . the discovery of planetary transits enabled us to measure the time between the start and end of transit , the shape of ingress and egress event , and the depth of occultation .",
    "this allows us to estimate several planetary parameters for transiting systems by modeling transit light curves .",
    "there are some ( almost ) equivalent but different types of formalism describing transit light curves @xcite @xcite . based on these formulae ,",
    "transit light curves are characterized by the combination of following parameters : the ratio of star - planet radii @xmath0 , the semimajor axis in units of the stellar radius @xmath1 , the orbital inclination @xmath2 , the limb - darkening parameters ( e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the quadratic limb - darkening law ) , the time of mid - transit @xmath5 , the phase of igress or egress @xmath6 , and the transit duration @xmath7 . by combining with the information from radial velocity observations , one can determine the true planetary mass @xmath8 and also the density of the planet @xmath9 for transiting planets .",
    "in addition , the mass - radius distribution enables us to estimate the planetary interior structure by modeling planetary atmospheres .",
    "after the first discovery of transit events , several teams started programs of transit surveys with ground - based telescopes @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "thanks to these ground - based transit surveys , the number of detections of transiting planets dramatically increased in these years . on the other hand , it is also important to conduct precise follow - up observations to determine precise parameters of transiting planets .",
    "for example , such follow - up observations are imperative to confirm the existence fo `` inflated '' planets ( e.g. , hd209458b ) or planets with massive cores ( e.g. , hd149026b ) .",
    "some groups have focused on such follow - up studies ( e.g. , the transit light curve project @xcite@xcite ) . and have contributed to improve the knowledge of exoplanetary nature .",
    "such ground - based transit surveys and follow - up observations are nowadays actively conducted in the world , and also two spectacular space missions _ corot _ @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite have been successfully initiated .",
    "these space - based transit surveys would open the door for detections of smaller earth - like transiting planets in the near future .      in infrared region ,",
    "the planet - to - star flux ratio is higher compared to that in optical wavelength .",
    "the thermal emission from a hot planet is detectable when the planet passes behind the host star , namely the time of secondary eclipses .",
    "the first detections of secondary eclipses were reported for hd209458b and tres-1b with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ in 2005 @xcite @xcite .",
    "the detections of secondary eclipses provide us the information of planetary dayside temperature .",
    "subsequently , knutson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) @xcite presented a series of _ spitzer _ observations of hd189733b over a half of the planetary orbital period , including a planetary transit and a secondary eclipse .",
    "they detected phase variations of hd189733b and reported a temperature map ( day - night contrast ) of the exoplanet .",
    "in addition , multi - wavelength secondary eclipse observations for several transiting hot jupiters revealed that some of hot jupiters have temperature inversion in upper atmosphere @xcite @xcite . also , very recently a few groups reported ground - based detections of secondary eclipses . in the coming decade , larger infrared space telescopes such as _ jwst _ and _ spica _ will enable us to study thermal emission of smaller and colder ( but still warm ) transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "given that a transiting planet is the one and only body in the planetary system , transit events would occur at a regular interval ( except for the effect of general relativity and stellar quadrupoles ) .",
    "however , if there is any additional bodies around transiting planets , such as other planets or moons , the interval of consecutive transits is not constant in principle .",
    "such variations is referred to as `` transit timing variations '' ( hereafter ttvs ) .",
    "theoretical studies for ttvs caused by another unseen planet were presented @xcite @xcite , and ttvs caused by an exomoon around a transiting planet were studied @xcite .",
    "an interesting point of observations of ttvs is that a typical amplitude of ttvs is large enough to detect an earth - mass planet around a transiting hot jupiter even with ground - based telescopes if the unseen planet is in mean motion resonance . recently",
    "a detection of ttvs for ogle - tr-111b was reported @xcite .",
    "observational studies of ttvs will become more active in the corot / kepler era .",
    "during a planetary transit , a small fraction of the stellar surface is blocked by the planetary body , and even smaller fraction of the starlight is transmitted through the optically thin portion of the planetary upper atmosphere .",
    "thus for transiting planets , one can search for additional absorption features due to the planetary atmosphere by obtaining spectra with sufficiently high spectral resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio , and comparing the spectra taken in and out of transit , at least in principle .",
    "this methodology is referred to as `` transmission spectroscopy '' ( figure  1 ) .",
    "pioneering theoretical studies predicted that such excess absorption would be especially strong in the optical transitions of alkali metals , such as na  i ( @xmath105890 , @xmath105896 ) and k  i ( @xmath107670 ) @xcite@xcite . in particular , the signal for the sodium doublet lines ( predicted by cloudless models ) was as strong as @xmath11 and the strongest in optical wavelength , and thus the sodium lines were considered to be the best target for this study .",
    "later , the first detection of an additional @xmath12 absorption for the sodium doublet lines ( @xmath13 ) was made for the hd209458 system with the stis on board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) @xcite .",
    "however the size of the signal was considerably weaker than the original prediction of @xmath11 with the cloudless models , and the weakness of the absorption has prompted theoreticians to invoke the presence of high cloud decks or haze in this planet .    on the ground side , however , some observers tried to detect the excess absorption in hd209458b with ground - based large telescopes , but cound not achieve sufficient sensitivity @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , recently a few groups report detections of sodium excess absorption in hd209458b and also hd189733b @xcite",
    ". the reports would stimulate independent confirmation and further ground - based studies in the near future .",
    "on the other hand , transmission spectroscopy has been also conducted in infrared wavelength region with the _ spitzer _ telescope , and some observers succeeded in detecting a few kinds of molecules in atmospheres of hot jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the methodology of transmission spectroscopy would be especially important in the future when larger infrared space telescopes _ jwst _ and _ spica _ are available , in order to search for bio - signatures in transiting earth - like or super - earth planets discovered by space - based transit survey missions such as _ corot _ , _ kepler _ , and _ tess _ , although such transmission spectroscopy observations may be difficult @xcite .        the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect ) is a phenomenon originally reported as a `` rotational effect '' in eclipsing binary systems by rossiter ( 1924 ) @xcite ( for the beta lyrae system ) and mclaughlin ( 1924 ) @xcite ( for the algol system ) . in the context of transiting planets ,",
    "queloz et al . ( 2000 ) first reported the detection of the rm effect in the hd209458 system .",
    "subsequently , theoretical discussions and analytic formulae for the rm effect were studied @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the rm effect is seen as the radial velocity anomaly during a transit caused by the partial occultation of the rotating stellar surface .",
    "since the radial velocity anomaly depends on the trajectory of the planet across the host star , by monitoring this anomaly throughout a transit , one can determine the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis denoted by @xmath14 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath14 has become widely recognized to be an useful diagnostic to investigate planet migration histories .",
    "it is because the standard disk - planet interaction models ( type ii migration models ) generally predict small misalignments between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis , while planet - planet scattering models @xcite @xcite or the kozai migration models for planets in binary systems @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite have possibilities to produce large spin - orbit misalignments .",
    "so far , the spin - orbit alignment angle @xmath14 has been measured for over 10 transiting planets @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . as evidenced by the number of recent publications , measurements of the rm effect",
    "have become one of the most active research topics in exoplanetary science .    among the observed transiting planets , three transiting eccentric planets ( hat - p-2b , xo-3b , and hd17156b )",
    "are particularly interesting targets , because the migration models that produce eccentric orbits may also produce large spin - orbit misalignments .",
    "interestingly , the outcomes of the measurements of these systems were different ; hat - p-2b and hd17156b are well - aligned and the results resemble the majority of other non - eccentric systems for which the rm effect has been measured , while xo-3b has a significant spin - orbit misalignment and it is currently the one and only exception which has a large spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "however , since we can not draw robust conclusions with just one sample of a spin - orbit misalignment @xcite , further observations of the rm effect are desired to investigate migration mechanisms of extrasolar planets in the future .      _",
    "question by d. n. c. lin _ : is there any possibility to detect weather variation of transiting planets by transmission spectroscopy ? + _ answer _ : weather variations may cause variations of excess absorption level , since haze or high cloud decks may suppress such absorption . thus if we are able to detect excess absorption for a single transit , we can compare the excess absorption level for every transit and can search for weather variations in transiting exoplanets . + _",
    "question by e. kokubo _ : how can we detect planetary rings around transiting planets ?",
    "+ _ answer _ : precise photometric monitoring of planetary transits will enable us to search for rings @xcite . also , precise measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect may provide us independent evidence of planetary rings @xcite .",
    "question by e. l. turner _ : does the xo-3b result confirm migration scenarios of planet - planet scattering or the kozai models statistically ? + _ answer _ : the existence of spin - orbit misaligned planetary systems favors dynamical scenarios of planet - planet scattering or the kozai migration models , and so the xo-3b result is an important result to confirm such scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , since currently xo-3b is the one and only system that have a large spin - orbit mislignment , more observations of the rm effect are desired , especially for transiting eccentric planets or transiting planets in binary systems , so as to detect more spin - orbit misaligned planets .",
