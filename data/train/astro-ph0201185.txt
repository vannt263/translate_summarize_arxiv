    "there is now a large and compelling body of observational evidence that suggests that most , if not all , galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are only found in a small minority of all galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what is it that makes some galaxies agn but most others quiescent ?",
    "one line of inquiry is to ask if the differences are to be found in their circumnuclear environments . in particular , is the difference simply a matter of whether or not the central black hole is being provided with interstellar gas to fuel the nuclear activity ?    the problem of providing fuel to an agn from the vast reservoirs of interstellar gas found in the disks of spiral galaxies is how to remove the angular momentum from the gas so it can fall into the nucleus .",
    "the two classical mechanisms that are invoked are interactions @xcite and bars @xcite , including nuclear bars @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive literature devoted to demonstrating that both are theoretically viable mechanisms for fueling agn @xcite .",
    "however , neither interactions nor bars of either type are sufficiently common among agn compared to non - agn galaxies to be the fueling mechanism in all cases @xcite .",
    "previous investigations have used _ hst _ to study the circumnuclear environments of seyfert galaxies and search for differences between the seyferts with and without broad - line components .",
    "@xcite obtained pre - costar imaging of a large sample of seyfert and non - seyfert markarian galaxies to look for differences in the nuclear structure of these galaxies at higher angular resolution than is possible with ground - based imaging .",
    "they discovered that the nuclei of broad - line seyfert @xmath0 galaxies are dominated by strong point sources . in contrast , seyfert @xmath1 galaxies and other markarian galaxies that lack broad - line regions contained weak or no strong nuclear source superimposed on the underlying galaxy s surface brightness profile .",
    "this result is further borne out in the extensive _ hst _ snapshot program of @xcite .",
    "they also invariably find more strong central point sources in seyfert 1 galaxies than in the seyfert 2s . as this survey",
    "was carried out with the unaberrated wfpc2 pc camera , these investigators were also able to look for differences in the nuclear environments of these galaxies .",
    "they found seyfert 2 galaxies were more likely to possess dusty nuclear environments than seyfert 1 galaxies , lending support to unified models , which propose obscuration of the broad - line region in seyfert 2s by dust .",
    "their observations are evidence for the presence of dust on large scales in the nuclear region , not in a torus immediately outside the broad - line region .",
    "visible  near - infrared color maps obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) have shown that the circumnuclear ( @xmath2 pc ) regions of a large number of low - luminosity agn contain nuclear spiral dust lanes .",
    "these spirals are distinct from the spiral arms on kpc scales in the main galaxy disk .",
    "@xmath3 color maps of these galaxies show that these ` nuclear spirals ' extend from 100 s of pc scales into the unresolved nucleus @xcite .",
    "theoretical models for the formation of nuclear spiral structure suggest that it is dynamically distinct from the main disk spiral arms @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that nuclear spirals in agn reside in nonself - gravitating disks and are therefore likely due to shocks in nuclear gaseous disks .",
    "they postulated that as shocks can dissipate energy and angular momentum , these nuclear spirals may be the signature of the fueling mechanism in these galaxies .",
    "nuclear spirals in agn have generally been seen mostly in seyfert 2s , although this could easily be a selection effect : the samples of @xcite and @xcite were mostly comprised of seyfert 2s .",
    "also , @xcite only observed seyfert 2s with _ nicmos _ as they have fainter nuclear psfs , and thus the circumnuclear environments of seyfert 2s are easier to study with _ hst _ than the circumnuclear environments of seyfert 1s .",
    "the question remains , however , if seyfert 1s and 2s contain nuclear spirals with the same relative frequency ; that is , nearly 100% as seen in seyfert 2s .",
    "as we only have near - infrared _ nicmos _ imaging of the seyfert 2s in the cfa sample , we need to use an alternate technique to look for nuclear spiral structure in these seyferts . in  [ sec : procedure ] we discuss our data - processing , and introduce a technique for creating `` structure maps '' in ",
    "[ sec : stmaps ] that are an excellent surrogate for color maps for detecting small - scale dust - extinction and emission - line features present in the visible - band images .",
    "we then use this technique to compare the circumnuclear environments of the seyfert 1s and 2s in   [ sec : morph ] and [ sec : sey ] , connecting the nuclear structures seen to the larger host galaxies in most cases . in  [ sec : conc ] we present a summary of our results , and discuss the implications for the fueling of the active nuclei .",
    "a limiting factor in statistical studies of seyfert galaxies is the notorious difficulty of identifying a homogeneous sample free of crippling selection biases . since seyferts are identified primarily by their line spectra , one way to be absolutely certain of completeness is to take a spectrum of _ every _ galaxy down to some sensible magnitude limit . at present ,",
    "the largest spectroscopically complete host - galaxy selected sample of seyfert galaxies is the @xcite sample derived from the cfa redshift survey @xcite . while not ideally homogeneous , its selection criteria are nonetheless very well understood .",
    "the cfa survey obtained optical spectra of a complete sample of 2399 galaxies down to a limiting photographic magnitude of @xmath4 in fields limited to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this spectroscopically complete sample of seyfert galaxies is reasonably large by agn standards ( 46 galaxies ) , and relatively free of most of the usual selection biases , especially biases against reddened agns that are inherent in traditional uv - excess surveys .",
    "a further advantage of the cfa sample is that @xcite have obtained high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra of the nuclei of galaxies identified as having narrow lines ( primarily seyfert 2s ) .",
    "this provides us with a definitive set of spectral classifications for all of the cfa seyfert galaxies with uniform depth . this important property",
    "is often overlooked in compiling samples of seyfert galaxies .",
    "much of the classification material in the literature is of mixed quality , especially for the intermediate types 1.5 , 1.8 , and 1.9 @xcite , where the broad - line component can be relatively weak . without a carefully and homogeneously acquired set of classification spectra",
    ", a sample will be biased against the detection of nuclei with weak broad - lines because such galaxies will be misclassified as seyfert 2s .",
    "this is a potential problem with large samples selected out of the general catalogs without regards to the quality of the available classification material , especially if such samples are going to be used to examine the statistical properties of seyferts with and without broad - line regions in direct spectra .",
    "a recent criticism of the cfa seyfert sample is that it missed many low - luminosity agn with weaker emission lines due to the fact that the spectra were obtained for the purpose of redshift estimation @xcite .",
    "our comparison of the circumnuclear regions of seyfert 1s and 2s is thus based primarily upon objects with relatively bright emission lines . in this paper",
    "we will refer to the seyfert 1 and 1.5s collectively as the `` seyfert 1s '' and the seyfert 1.8 , 1.9 , and 2s collectively as the `` seyfert 2s . ''",
    "this division reflects the fact that most of the 1.8s and 1.9s were at one time classified as seyfert 2s , and is thus a division between `` strong broad lines '' and `` weak broad lines '' rather than an arbitrary division among what is arguably a continuum of types .",
    "lumping the 1.8s and 1.9s in with the `` seyfert 1s '' would only have the effect of giving us a much smaller number of seyfert 2s , but it does not otherwise affect our results significantly as will become apparent .",
    "the final virtue of this sample is that it is volume limited . for all seyfert types , @xmath9 tests @xcite show that both seyfert 1s and 2s have @xmath10 to within the uncertainties @xcite .",
    "@xcite repeated this analysis using different combinations of the various intermediate types , showing that this result is unaffected by how the seyferts are subdivided into different types .",
    "the only systematic effect found thus far is that luminosity functions of the cfa seyferts as a function of seyfert type @xcite show that the integrated ( host+nucleus ) luminosities of the seyfert 1s are on average about 1 magnitude brighter than the seyfert 2s .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest that this is primarily due to the systematically brighter seyfert 1 nuclei .    out of the 46 cfa seyferts in our sample 43 ( @xmath11% )",
    "have been imaged in broad bandpasses by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . in general , the archival pc1 camera imaging in broad - band filters",
    "( most of which are snapshots ) constitute a relatively uniform set of images with sufficient depth and spatial resolution to reveal detailed structures at subarcsecond scales in the nuclear regions .",
    "most of these structures are expected to be due to stars and dust in the host galaxy .",
    "extended emission - line regions can also be seen in these broad - band images , if they are high surface - brightness regions composed of essentially unresolved knots of emission , even though the bandpasses are broader than used in narrow - band imaging work with _ hst _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these images will permit us to map out the immediate ( few 100  pc ) environment of nearby seyfert nuclei in a well - defined , spectroscopically complete sample of objects .",
    "we have searched the hst archives for all publicly available wfpc2 images of the cfa seyfert galaxies listed in table  1 of @xcite . we include mrk471 which was accidentally omitted from huchra & burg s table  1 ( but included in their analysis ) , and exclude the starburst galaxy mrk789 @xcite . for this work we have selected only those galaxies classified as seyferts and neglected liners , x - ray galaxies and qsos .",
    "the seyfert classifications are taken from the classifications given by @xcite .",
    "the final sample of 46 galaxies , our adopted classifications , and the archival imaging parameters ( exposure time , filter , and go program i d ) , are listed in table  [ tbl : cfa ] .",
    "distances to each galaxy in mpc are listed in column 7 , computed by transforming the heliocentric radial velocities given by @xcite into the rest frame of the local group following @xcite and adopting @xmath12kmsec@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "column 8 gives the projected scale in parsecs corresponding to 1on the sky at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "hst / wfpc2 _ images of suitable quality for our purposes are available for 43 of the 46 cfa seyferts .",
    "there is no archival wfpc2 imaging for three of the galaxies among the 46 : mrk841 , ngc3080 , and 1335 + 39 .",
    "the absence of these galaxies from our sample does not significantly affect our results .",
    "most of the galaxies ( 35 out of 43 ) have 500-second f606w ( wide - v ) band wfpc2 planetary camera ( pc ) images obtained as part of a large _ hst _ cycle 5 snapshot survey of agns ( go5479 , pi : malkan ) .",
    "images of the remaining galaxies are available from archival data of individual observations made by a variety of programs ( table  [ tbl : cfa ] , column 6 ) . for these galaxies",
    ", we used the f547 m filter or f814w filter ( i - band ) images if f606w images were unavailable .    in the case of ngc1068 ,",
    "all of the pc detector pixels in the central 23  of the nuclear region were completely saturated in the 500-second f606w snapshot image from go5479 .",
    "for this reason we also use the archival f547 m images to recover information about the nucleus .",
    "these data consist of a pair of short integrations ( 140 and 300-seconds ) that are not saturated .",
    "we will use these to probe structures closer than @xmath141 , and use the deeper f606w snapshot for the outer regions .",
    "all of the wfpc2 images used in this study were already processed by the standard stsci reduction pipeline ( described by * ? ? ?",
    "after inspection of the post - pipeline images to verify that they were of acceptable quality for this study , the only additional processing steps required were removal of cosmic rays , and treatment of saturation - related artifacts in the nuclei ( destreaking ) .",
    "all of the galaxies selected had the active nucleus roughly centered in the pc detector , so we did not process any of the wf camera frames .    the majority of the images ( 35 of the 43 ) are snapshots acquired in a single exposure . in these cases",
    ", we used the cosmicrays task in the noao iraf package to statistically remove most of the cosmic ray events .",
    "cosmic ray events were defined as pixels deviating by more than 5@xmath15 above the local mean computed in a @xmath16 pixel window , and were replaced by the average of the four neighboring pixels .",
    "any residual cosmic ray events were hand - cleaned from the final images with an interactive median filtering tool in the xvista package .    for those galaxies with pairs of images of the same ( or similar ) integration time , we combined the images using a statistical differencing technique implemented as a xvista procedure script .",
    "this latter technique works as follows . the difference image formed by subtracting one image in the pair from the other consists primarily of positive and negative cosmic ray hits , as the galaxy , foreground stars , and background all cancel to within the uncertainties .",
    "all pixels within @xmath17 of the mean residual background level on the difference image are then set to zero ( tagging them as unaffected by cosmic rays ) . a pair of cosmic - ray template images is then formed by separating the remaining positive and negative pixels .",
    "these templates are subtracted from the original images , and the two cosmic - ray subtracted images are added together to form the final galaxy image .",
    "a number of the images have the nuclei over - exposed and saturated .",
    "we judged saturation by consulting the data quality file ( dqf ) that accompanies each wfpc2 image @xcite .",
    "two forms of saturation were encountered : pixels at or above the maximum a / d converter level ( adc saturation ) , and pixels that are so saturated they overfill the wells and bleed charge into adjacent pixels in their column ( full - well saturation or `` bleeding '' ) . in our descriptions below ,",
    "a nucleus was judged to be `` completely saturated '' if ( 1 ) it showed bleed streaks due to full - well saturation , or ( 2 ) the central 9 or more pixels were flagged as saturated in the dqf , corresponding to all pixels within the fwhm of the pc1 point - spread function in this band . in general , it takes only one or two pixels to be saturated in the core of the psf to obviate deriving any useful quantitative photometry of the nucleus . for this reason our analysis will concentrate on morphological characteristics . bleed streaks of between 1 and 5 pixels in width appear in the most saturated nuclei , and",
    "would complicate our structure mapping analysis described in the following section if left alone .",
    "we destreaked these images via a simple method that successively interpolated across the streaks from the inside out until they are removed .",
    "no significant artifacts from the destreaking process are seen in our final structure maps .",
    "ideally , we would like to map the circumnuclear dust in these galaxies by creating photometric color maps from pairs of images taken at widely separated wavelengths , e.g. , by making @xmath18 color maps as we did in our previous study of seyfert 2s @xcite . for more than half of our sample , however , corresponding nicmos images are not available , especially among the seyfert 1s .",
    "even where nicmos imaging is available , the small field of view of nicmos restricts the maps to the central 510  or so @xcite . we therefore need an alternative way to recover this information in the absence of wide - field ir images .    in @xmath18 color maps like those we presented in @xcite , the regions of strong red or blue color that appear are primarily due to structures that are strongest in the v - band images .",
    "the h - band images , by contrast , are very smooth and appear essentially featureless in all but the most unusual cases . in creating a @xmath18 color map",
    "we are in effect using the h - band image to suppress the underlying starlight distribution in the v - band image .",
    "the dust and emission structures are certainly visible in the v - band images , but their contrast is diminished by the bright stellar background , especially in the innermost regions .",
    "the contrast is further reduced in the seyfert 1s by the strong , unresolved nuclear point - source , especially since the core of the psf is usually completely saturated in these images , and the surrounding 12  are contaminated by light from the wings of the wfpc2 point - spread function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one way to enhance such fine structural features in single - filter images is to fit the smooth galaxian starlight profile with elliptical isophotes and then subtract or divide the model fit from the images .",
    "the fine structure emerges as fit residuals .",
    "this is often done to search for dust and other structures in ground - based and _ hst _ images of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the great majority of our galaxies , however , this technique is impractical because the nuclear - region isophotes are generally not elliptical and isophote fitting fails completely , producing residuals that are more a reflection of the fit s failure to converge rather than real structures .",
    "the presence of a bright , saturated nucleus in many of our images makes matters worse .",
    "we have instead devised an alternative approach based on richardson - lucy ( r - l ) image restoration @xcite applied to _ hst _",
    "imaging @xcite that yields excellent results , as we shall describe and demonstrate .",
    "the method is as follows ( why it works is described below ) . for each cleaned image , we convolve a copy of that image with a model of the psf for the pc1 camera appropriate to the filter bandpass generated using tinytim @xcite .",
    "we adopted an elliptical galaxy template spectrum for computing the polychromatic model psf .",
    "we then divide the original image by the psf - smoothed image , and then further convolve this ratio with the transpose of the model psf .",
    "mathematically , this procedure produces a final image @xmath19 defined as : @xmath20\\otimes p^{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the original image , @xmath22 is the model psf , and @xmath23 is the transpose of the model psf , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the convolution operator .",
    "( the use of @xmath23 reveals the origins of this technique in r - l restoration , as shall be described below ) .",
    "the procedure described above has been implemented as an xvista script that performs all of the convolutions in the fourier domain using fast - fourier transforms .",
    "we call the resulting image @xmath19 a `` structure map '' because the process described above has effectively removed most of the larger - scale smooth light distribution , highlighting unresolved and marginally resolved structures on the scale of the psf .",
    "dusty regions appear dark , while compact emission - line regions or clusters ( knots ) of stars appear bright , much as they would in a color map derived from two images .",
    "these maps recover both dust and emission structures with very high fidelity , and with fewer artifacts due to mis - matched psfs in the inner regions as seen in visible / ir color maps",
    ".    figures  [ fig : stmap1 ]  [ fig : stmap7 ] and figure  [ fig : n1068 ] ( ngc1068 ) show the structure maps for the central 30  of each of the 43 cfa seyfert galaxies in our sample .",
    "the intensities ( black to white ) show the fractional residuals ( @xmath26 ) about the original pixel - to - pixel intensity .",
    "dark regions show the locations of dust obscuration , and bright regions are either locations of enhanced stellar light ( e.g. , star formation regions ) or emission - line regions ( the f606w filter is wide enough to admit several bright emission lines from high surface - brightness regions ) .",
    "images appear in the same order as listed in table  [ tbl : cfa ] , running from left - to - right and top - to - bottom across the figure , in order of seyfert 1 through seyfert 2 . within each seyfert type ,",
    "the galaxies appear in alphanumeric order by the name listed in column 1 of table  [ tbl : cfa ] .",
    "the scale bar in each image panel indicates 1  kpc projected size at the adopted distance of the galaxy ( table  [ tbl : cfa ] , col 8) .",
    "figure  [ fig : n1068 ] shows ngc1068 separately as its close proximity and large physical size allows sampling of particularly fine spatial scales .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : n1068 ] shows an f606w filter image with the same 30  field of view used in the other structure maps , while the right panel shows the central 10  of a short - exposure f547 m filter image .",
    "a detailed description and interpretation of these structure maps is provided in the next section .",
    "when referring to images of individual galaxies in the text below , we will give the figure number and the image s location in the figure the first time it is cited . for example , the image of um146 is fig[fig : stmap5 ] middle right .",
    "structure maps of visible - wavelength wfpc2 images are excellent surrogates for color maps , allowing us to recover a great deal of information from a single - band image .",
    "to illustrate this , figure  [ fig : vh ] shows ( left ) a @xmath18 color map of the central 5  of ngc7674 from @xcite and ( right ) the structure map of the same region derived from the v - band image alone using the techniques described above .",
    "the structure map shows all of the dust ( dark ) and emission ( bright ) features visible in the @xmath18 color map , but without artifacts due to the mismatch between the wfpc2 and nicmos point - spread functions .",
    "the structure maps give us two advantages over the @xmath18 color maps derived from wfpc2 and nicmos images : we can get closer to point - like nuclei at full wfpc2 resolution ( higher than that of nicmos ) , and we can recover information across most or all of the @xmath1434 pc1 camera field of view , as compared with the @xmath145 field of view of the nic1 images presented in @xcite .",
    "this greater field of view will be crucial for our analysis as it will allow us to study any associations between nuclear dust structures and larger - scale structures like bars or disk spiral arms in the host galaxies proper .",
    "why does it work ?",
    "the structure map defined above is approximately the `` correction image '' that emerges from the second iteration of a r - l image reconstruction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* eqns 5 & 6 ) . at the end of each iteration of an r - l reconstruction ,",
    "the resulting reconstructed image is convolved with the psf and compared to the original image .",
    "a correction image is generated by forming the ratio of the original image to its psf - convolved reconstruction which measures the fractional deviation between the model and the original .",
    "this information is then used to refine the estimate of the reconstructed image during the next iteration .",
    "this correction and comparison process is repeated until the correction image no longer changes significantly , usually because noise and artifacts , relentlessly propagated through each iteration , overwhelm whatever residual structures remain to be reconstructed .",
    "after the second iteration , the corrector frame contains the unrecovered structures after the reconstruction has recovered only the first - order , smooth structure in the image ( the first iteration in typical implementations compares the original image to a `` reconstruction '' which contains no structure at all ) .",
    "our structure map is essentially this second - iteration correction image , which is why it highlights unresolved and marginally resolved high - order structures present in the images .",
    "formally , however , the expression defining the corrector image from the second r - l iteration contains an additional convolution with the transpose of the psf in the denominator ( i.e. , @xmath27 instead of @xmath28 ) .",
    "this difference is minor , as operationally it makes the true second - iteration correction frame slightly smoother than our structure map .    like any reconstructive technique ,",
    "structure maps are exquisitely sensitive to noise and artifacts in the images , especially single bright or dead pixels .",
    "if these are not removed , the bright negative or positive false stars appear in the structure map images .",
    "other artifacts are the appearance of negative `` moats '' around very high - contrast point sources ( either in the nuclei or nearby field stars ) and bright spots or smudges near the residuals of cosmic ray events ( we can never completely remove the brightest ion - event trails ) .",
    "moats are a problem for those images with strongly saturated nuclei .",
    "we can eliminate most moats by truncating the nuclear brightness profiles before creating the structure map , allowing us to recover information close to a bright nucleus . in the very brightest nuclei",
    "we still lose information despite this .",
    "artifacts due to single bad pixels are removed manually using the interactive pixel zapper ( tvzap ) in xvista and then iterating until all of the most obvious artifacts are removed from the subsequent structure maps .    while the structure mapping procedure appears superficially similar to so - called `` digital unsharp masking '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results are quite different . to illustrate this , the top two panels of figure  [ fig : unsharp ] show ( top left ) the central 15-arcseconds of the unprocessed f606w image of ngc3516 ( displayed as logarithmic intensity ) and ( top right ) the structure map generated using the method described above .",
    "below these we show a pair of normalized unsharp - mask images generated using ( left bottom ) a gaussian kernel with fwhm=2.2 pixels ( the fwhm of the core of the psf on the pc1 detector in this filter ) , and ( right bottom ) a @xmath29 pixel boxcar kernel ( the smallest practical boxcar kernel width ) .",
    "each of the three maps are displayed to show the same range of dark and bright features .",
    "the structure maps created by the method described above are superior in all respects .",
    "no choice of gaussian , boxcar , or other smoothing kernels ( e.g. , hanning , cosine bell , etc . ) could be found that produced results of comparable quality . in some sense",
    "this should not be surprising , as what passes for unsharp masking in the literature is all too often the result of an arbitrary choice of smoothing kernel .",
    "our method is formally rooted in reconstructive analysis of the images and uses the image psf which embodies detailed information about how the original images are formed , including the power in the broad wings surrounding the diffraction - limited core .",
    "the circumnuclear regions of all of the seyfert galaxies in our sample , with exceptions noted below , have dust and emission regions in the inner kiloparsec .",
    "it is immediately evident from the structure maps that the distribution of circumnuclear dust in most of these galaxies takes the form of nuclear dust spirals . by analogy with the spirals arms of galaxy disks ,",
    "we can characterize them as either `` grand design '' ( clearly delineated and symmetric two - arm spirals ) or `` flocculent '' ( spiral - form , but broken into many arms ) .",
    "our structure mapping technique has successfully recovered all of the spiral dust lanes previously reported in the cfa seyfert 2s @xcite , although we can now trace these structures to larger radii than in the limited field - of - view nicmos images .",
    "the nuclear dust spirals in most of the galaxies in this sample appear to connect to larger scale dust lanes to the signal - to - noise limit of the images .",
    "some of these dust lanes form nearly contiguous arms that can be followed for over a full rotation and extend many kiloparsecs in length , such as those in ngc6104 ( fig[fig : stmap3 ] bottom left ) , and mrk744 ( fig[fig : stmap4 ] middle left ) .",
    "the fact that some of these dust lanes extend for kiloparsecs suggest they are relatively long - lived and trace the infall of cold , dense material from the host galaxy disk .",
    "a notable feature of some nuclear spirals is that they are the inner extension of large - scale , often `` straight '' dust lanes along the edges of large - scale stellar bars in the host galaxies .",
    "particularly striking examples of this are mrk766 ( fig[fig : stmap1 ] bottom left ) , ngc5940 ( fig[fig : stmap2 ] top right ) , a0048 + 29 ( fig[fig : stmap2 ] middle right ) , mrk471 ( fig[fig : stmap4 ] top right ) , ngc5674 ( fig[fig : stmap5 ] middle left ) , ngc5347 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] top left ) , ngc5695 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] top right ) , and ngc7674 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] middle right ) .",
    "this dust morphology is expected from hydrodynamic simulations of the flow of interstellar gas under the influence of large - scale stellar bar potentials @xcite , and is seen in non - active galaxies , especially in later - type barred spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will discuss these structures further in the next section .",
    "while spiral dust lanes are very common , they are not the only dust distribution seen . in some galaxies",
    "the distribution of dust is chaotic , having no clear overall pattern .",
    "the best examples of this are ngc3227 ( fig[fig : stmap3 ] top left ) , mrk266sw ( fig[fig : stmap6 ] bottom left ) , and ngc5929 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] middle left ) .",
    "these three galaxies are all strongly interacting and we will discuss them further below . in two galaxies , ngc4235 ( fig[fig : stmap2 ] top left ) and",
    "ngc4388 ( fig[fig : stmap6 ] bottom right ) , the host galaxy is sufficiently inclined relative to the line of sight that we can not discern the circumnuclear distribution of the dust .",
    "only a few galaxies show no dust structures on @xmath30kpc in their nuclei .",
    "these are the seyfert 1s mrk231 ( fig[fig : stmap1 ] top left ) and mrk335 ( fig[fig : stmap1 ] middle left ) , and the dwarf seyfert 1 ngc4395 ( fig[fig : stmap4 ] bottom left ) ; although mrk231 does show larger - scale structure ) .",
    "the first two are among the most distant objects in our sample and have extremely prominent nuclei , but there are distant seyfert 1s which still show structures on small scales despite their distance ( e.g. , mrk279 and mrk471 ) .",
    "the mottling in the structure map of ngc4395 is due to being able to resolve giant stars in this nearby ( @xmath31mpc ) galaxy",

    "ngc5252 ( fig[fig : stmap5 ] top left ) and mrk270 ( fig[fig : stmap5 ] bottom right ) have flocculent nuclear spirals embedded in inclined disks on scales of 12kpc . in both cases",
    "we see only the half of the disk on the near side of the host galaxy relative to our line of sight ; this is the side of the disk that will obscure the most starlight `` behind '' the disk from our point of view .",
    "the far side of the dust disk will be less distinct because there is more galaxian starlight between us and the back of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : nucdisk ] shows the disks outlined in the structure maps .",
    "the flocculent nuclear dust disk in ngc5252 is the same one found by @xcite after they divided their wfpc2 continuum images by a smooth elliptical isophote fit .",
    "the kinematic properties of this disk , which also appears in emission , has been described by @xcite . in our structure map images , we find that this disk has an axis ratio of 0.73 , implying a disk inclination of @xmath32 , with the semimajor axis of @xmath33  ( @xmath34kpc ) oriented along @xmath35 .",
    "this orientation is almost exactly perpendicular to the major axis of the host galaxy stellar disk ( @xmath36 ) , but it is misaligned by @xmath37 relative to the axis of the famous ionization cone in this object ( @xmath38 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the disk of mrk270 is nearly face - on ( axis ratio of 0.927 reported by 2mass ) .",
    "mrk270 has only small - scale extranuclear emission , seen here as the white filaments between @xmath44  northeast of the nucleus in figure  [ fig : nucdisk]b .",
    "this emission can not be characterized as an ionization cone per se ( see @xcite for ground - based [ ] emission - line imaging ) .",
    "it is more likely to be dusty material in the farside of the nuclear disk illuminated and ionized by the nucleus ; note how the bright filaments of emission appear to merge smoothly with the darker ( dust ) filaments in the foreground .",
    "an additional component of diffuse emission , apparently _ stellar _ in origin , is seen nearly perpendicular to the gas disks in both of these galaxies . in mrk270 , this is the diffuse dumb - bell shaped feature aligned along @xmath45 and extending to a projected radius of @xmath40 .",
    "this feature is aligned exactly with the major axis of the nuclear stellar bar seen in h - band nicmos images @xcite , and the outer edge of the dumb - bell coincides with the ends of the nuclear bar . in ngc5252 , the enhanced starlight is aligned nearly exactly with the major axis of the stellar isophotes along @xmath46 , but it is less pronounced and lacks the sharp cutoff in radius seen in mrk270 .",
    "such features are not unusual among the structure maps in our sample",
    ". in particular , the ridge lines of the strong stellar bars in mrk766 , a0048 + 29 , ngc5674 , ( and present but less obvious without contrast enhancement in ngc5940 ) appear as excess diffuse light in our structure maps .",
    "it is not immediately obvious to us why our structure mapping technique should enhance such features , as they correspond to structures many times larger than the psf , but we note that in these latter cases the features we see in the structure map are clearly present in the unenhanced raw images , and not artifacts of the enhancement process .",
    "emission regions appear in the structure maps as bright , often filamentary structures on many scales .",
    "the larger - scale emission features , like those seen in mrk573 ( fig[fig : stmap6 ] top right ) and ngc3516 ( fig[fig : stmap3 ] top right ) are previously known from ground - based and space - based imaging ( cf .",
    "@xcite or @xcite for mrk573 ; @xcite for ngc3516 ) .",
    "some of these regions are on scales of @xmath471 , like the small figure-8 ( bicone ? ) of emission we see in ngc7682 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] bottom left ) or the s - shaped region interrupted by dust in the nucleus of ugc6100 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] bottom right ) .",
    "other `` emission '' features appearing in the structure maps are bright stellar knots , many appearing along the spiral arms of the host galaxy .",
    "some of these knots of emission can be quite near the nucleus , signalling at least some circumnuclear star formation in these objects .",
    "the most obvious example in our sample is the well - known bright starburst ring in ngc7469 ( fig[fig : stmap2 ] middle left ) @xcite , but not all of these appear to qualify as `` starbursts . ''",
    "interesting cases , particularly for future study by those interested in circumnuclear star formation are a0048 + 29 ( a nuclear ring and bar ) , ngc7603 ( fig[fig : stmap3 ] bottom right ) , mrk334 ( fig[fig : stmap4 ] top left ) , mrk744 ( fig[fig : stmap4 ] middle left ) , and ngc7674 ( fig[fig : stmap7 ] middle right ) .      about 75% of the host galaxies in the cfa sample",
    "are known to be barred @xcite .",
    "it is in many of these barred galaxies that we find the grand - design nuclear spirals on sub - kiloparsec scales .",
    "furthermore , most of the spirals are clearly connected to the host galaxy via dust lanes running along the bars .",
    "particular examples are ngc4235 , ngc5940 , mrk817 , ngc6104 , mrk471 , ugc12138 , ngc5674 , ngc5347 , ngc5695 , and ngc7674 , all have `` straight '' dust lanes on large scales in the structure maps in addition to nuclear grand - design spirals .",
    "these straight dust lanes are expected for gas and dust compressed in the principal shocks along the leading edges of a bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all but mrk817 , ngc6104 , and ngc5695 have bars strong enough to have led to a barred classification in the rc3 catalog ; the rc3 classification for these three galaxies is given as `` ? '' .",
    "ngc6104 , ngc5695 , and ngc7674 were observed to have bars in the @xmath48band by @xcite ( noted by the `` bir '' in table  [ tbl : prop ] ) .",
    "they did not observe mrk817 , although @xcite report a distinct bar in mrk817 in their wfpc2 image ( the same image we use to create this structure map ) , and @xcite list it as barred in their ir imaging .",
    "mrk279 shows some evidence for the long , `` straight '' dust lanes found in many large - scale bars , but no bar classification is given by either the rc3 , @xcite , or @xcite , although @xcite give it a relatively weak bar classification .",
    "only three strongly barred galaxies do not contain circumnuclear grand - design spirals : ngc7469 , ngc3516 , and ngc5695 . ngc7469 and ngc5695 may contain them , although the circumnuclear region is difficult to resolve well in these two objects , while ngc3516 clearly has a multi - arm spiral .    nuclear spiral structure in the gas ( and dust ) on sub - kiloparsec scales",
    "is predicted by hydrodynamical models of gas flow in the central regions of barred galaxies . in many cases",
    "these spirals were barely resolved by the numerical simulations in the inner kiloparsec due to a decreasing number of sph particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations @xcite show the formation of structures remarkably similar to what we see here in single - barred galaxies on comparable ( few hundred parsec ) scales . the structures are spiral shocks in gas with relatively high sound speeds , leading to gas flows directly into the nucleus ( or at least down to the smallest scales resolved by their models ) . at low sound speeds , they find that the spiral shocks are interrupted by the inner lindblad resonance and the inflows terminate on a nuclear ring",
    ". only two of our galaxies have nuclear rings : ngc7469 ( figure  [ fig : stmap2 ] , middle left ) and a0048 + 29 ( figure  [ fig : stmap2 ] , middle right ) .",
    "interestingly , none of the unbarred galaxies have grand - design nuclear spirals .",
    "the nuclear spiral structure in these systems is often multi - arm and `` flocculent '' in form .",
    "the morphology of the nuclear spirals in the seyfert 2s were previously described in @xcite .",
    "the seyfert 1s shown here exhibit similar types of structures . particularly striking and well - resolved",
    "nuclear spirals are apparent in ngc4051 , ngc3227 , ngc7603 , and mrk993 .",
    "ngc4051 shows some evidence for a grand - design , nuclear spiral on roughly kiloparsec scales , but on smaller ( several hundred parsec ) scales the structure breaks up into multi - arm spirals .",
    "the spiral structure in ngc3227 is very irregular and the individual components or armlets can rarely be traced for more than 60 degrees .",
    "the spirals in ngc7603 and mrk993 are much more regular , but appear to have more than two arms .",
    "flocculent spiral structures are found in both barred and unbarred galaxies and could be due to acoustic , or pressure - driven , instabilities in the circumnuclear gaseous disks @xcite .",
    "there are three strongly interacting galaxies in this sample : ngc3227 , mrk266sw , and ngc5929 .",
    "these galaxies have very chaotic dust structures from large scales down to less than a kiloparsec , suggestive of the transport of a significant fraction of the host galaxy s ism into the central regions .",
    "such massive transport is a feature of hydrodynamical simulations of interacting galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , other clearly interacting but decidedly less morphologically disturbed galaxies in our sample , specifically mrk744 and ngc1144 , exhibit a relatively ordered and spiral dust morphology down to less than kiloparsec scales .",
    "however , both still have very dusty nuclear regions compared to other galaxies in the sample .",
    "bar modes which might drive gas inflow are expected in minor merger systems , although only after about 1gyr has elapsed since the merger between the host and satellite galaxy @xcite . the nearly complete dusty disorder",
    "we see in the nuclear regions of the most strongly interacting galaxies suggests that the matter transport has occurred on less than a dynamical timescale , much faster than the typical slow and steady infall due to a bar potential .",
    "these interacting galaxies clearly have sufficient matter inflow to fuel nuclear activity on the scales probed by these _ hst _ observations .",
    "at first sight , the differences between seyfert 1s and 2s appears striking , as nearly all of the seyfert 1s and 1.5s have bright , saturated star - like nuclei showing multiple airy rings and diffraction spikes , whereas the seyfert 1.8s , 1.9s , and 2s have fainter , unsaturated nuclei .",
    "this strong nuclear brightness contrast was seen by @xcite in wfpc-1 images of seyferts , and confirmed by @xcite using a larger wfpc2 imaging survey from which many of our images were derived .",
    "as we shall see , however , the circumnuclear regions do not show such systematic differences between the two types : only the very bright nucleus gives any hint as to the spectral type of the nucleus .",
    "a major goal of our study is to determine if there are any differences in the circumnuclear morphologies of these seyfert 1s and 2s .",
    "we inspected each galaxy for evidence of circumnuclear features such as nuclear spirals , bars , and rings , in addition to dust lanes consistent with a large - scale bar feeding gas and dust into this region .",
    "table  [ tbl : prop ] lists the galaxies from table  [ tbl : cfa ] and provides their morphological type , angular size ( @xmath49 ) , and axis ratio ( @xmath50 ) from the rc3 , along with our morphological classifications .    to examine them in detail and take into account the range of distances and sizes of the cfa sample , we first considered a distance - limited subset restricted to galaxies within 100 mpc in which we can easily resolve structure in the central kiloparsec ; more distant galaxies are denoted by a `` d '' in column8 of table  [ tbl : prop ] .",
    "in addition , nearly edge - on ( @xmath51 ) and strongly interacting galaxies were excluded .",
    "this leaves us with seven seyfert 1s and fourteen seyfert 2s .",
    "all of these galaxies , with the exception of ngc4395 ( which is exceptionally close and small ) show evidence for nuclear spiral structure on sub - kiloparsec scales with no obvious differences in nuclear dust morphology between the seyfert types .",
    "we also formed a size - limited subset in which we took into account the variation in actual physical size of the galaxies . to do this",
    "we computed the projected physical size in kiloparsecs of @xmath49 at the distance of the galaxy ( column 6 of table  [ tbl : prop ] ) and then the fraction of this total size contained within the 30  cutouts from the pc camera ( column 7 of table  [ tbl : prop ] ) .",
    "the size - limited subset only includes sufficiently large seyferts , defined here as those with less than 50% of the galaxy within the @xmath52 images ; smaller galaxies are labeled with an `` s '' in table  [ tbl : prop ] .",
    "this subset contains nine seyfert  1s and sixteen seyfert  2s . _",
    "all of these galaxies , with the exception again of ngc4395 , also contain nuclear spiral structure independent of seyfert type .",
    "_ while the choice of @xmath53 mpc and 50% for these distance - limited and size - limited subsets is somewhat arbitrary , they do effectively remove the smallest and most distant galaxies in which we would not be able to clearly resolve circumnuclear structure , regardless of their seyfert type .",
    "looking at our entire sample , what we do not see is a tendency for seyfert 2 nuclei to be more frequently crossed by host galaxy dust lanes as found by @xcite for a larger , but arguably more heterogeneous sample of seyferts .",
    "this is likely due to the different hubble type distributions of our respective samples .",
    "the median seyfert 1 host studied by @xcite is earlier than the median seyfert 2 type , while the seyfert 1s and 2s we study have a similar hubble type distribution .",
    "this difference in host galaxy type can explain why @xcite found that seyfert 2s were dustier than seyfert 1s , whereas we do not find a similar trend . within the context of the standard unification hypothesis ,",
    "@xcite invoke the apparent differences in the circumnuclear environments of seyfert 1s and 2s to posit that galactic dust on hundreds of parsec scales could obscure seyfert 1s and make them appear as seyfert 2s .",
    "they suggest that this `` galactic dust model '' is a viable alternative to the classical torus model @xcite , where the obscuration that gives rise to the seyfert 1/2 dichotomy lies on parsec scales .",
    "we do , however , have examples of nuclei obscured by host - galaxy dust in our sample ; particularly striking examples are the interacting galaxies mrk266sw ( figure  [ fig : stmap5 ] , bottom left ) and ngc5929 ( figure  [ fig : stmap7 ] , middle left ) , and the edge - on galaxy ngc4388 ( figure  [ fig : stmap6 ] , bottom right ) , where the nuclei are only visible at ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these examples offer qualitative support of the galactic dust model .",
    "the fact that we find similar circumnuclear structure in seyfert 1s and 2s at fixed hubble type does not refute the galactic dust model as the actual dust structures responsible for the nuclear obscuration in any given seyfert 2 are still likely to be unresolved in most cases ( with perhaps the few exceptions noted above ) due to the small sizes of molecular clouds .",
    "we suspect that the root cause of our discrepancy with the results of @xcite reflect differences in the distribution of host galaxy morphological types between the seyfert 1s and 2s in the respective samples .",
    "the different distributions in @xcite s sample may be due to the fact that most of the galaxies in their sample are markarian seyferts , selected on the basis of uv - excess .",
    "by contrast , samples like the cfa seyferts presented here and the palomar seyferts @xcite have similar hubble type distributions between seyfert 1s and 2s , and these surveys are both based on spectroscopy of large numbers of galaxies in a flux - limited survey .",
    "using a new `` structure mapping '' technique , we have found nuclear spiral dust structures that are plausibly related to the inflow of interstellar gas from the host galaxies into the nuclear regions of a well - defined sample of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we find the dust morphology that is expected if interstellar gas is being driven primarily by large - scale bars , and if interstellar gas is mass - transported inwards by torques arising from tidal interactions .",
    "there is also circumstantial evidence for the spiral infall of gas , with greater or lesser degrees of coherence , in galaxies which show neither stellar bars nor evidence of tidal interaction . in most cases the spiral dust structures seen previously at small scales in more traditional color maps",
    "are shown to be connected to the large - scale properties of the galaxies , although they are not simply continuations of the large - scale features .",
    "all of these structures are consistent with the idea that interstellar gas from the host galaxy may be transported into the nucleus , to varying degrees of intensity and coherence , via a variety of mechanisms .",
    "the case that these structures are related to fueling the agn is primarily phenomenological .",
    "theoretical models of gas inflow in barred and interacting galaxies predict structures similar in appearance to those we see in our images .",
    "however , what we do not know is whether we can make the final connection between these larger - scale structures and the central black hole . that we find these structures in most of the seyferts studied here makes this connection plausible , but we can not yet make it conclusively . from an observational perspective ,",
    "a particularly difficult challenge is how to establish kinematic evidence of inflow in cold interstellar material on these scales . from the theoretical side ,",
    "work on what inflow rates are expected , and what observational factors ( either in addition to or in the absence of direct kinematical measurements ) might help inform such estimations on an object - by - object basis .",
    "it has long been known that bars and interactions occur in inactive galaxies , and there is no reason to expect that they will not funnel gas into the inner regions of those galaxies in much the same way .",
    "further , nuclear spirals have been observed in a number of normal spiral galaxies without obvious agn activity @xcite .",
    "if nuclear spirals are signatures of shocks that can dissipate sufficient angular momentum to fuel a black hole , the question remains why normal galaxies that exhibit such structures are not active , particularly as it is now clear that essentially all galaxies harbor nuclear black holes , with masses closely correlated with their host galaxy properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the transport of gas into the central ( @xmath54pc ) region is a necessary , but not unique requirement of nuclear activity .",
    "the near - ubiquity of coherent , circumnuclear dust structures suggestive of shocks and matter inflow supports the conjecture that they are responsible for fueling their agn . the first step to test",
    "this is a study of a well - defined control sample of quiescent spiral galaxies of similar morphological type observed and analyzed in similar ways to the seyferts .",
    "we are currently engaged in an on - going hst snapshot program to address this question of the relative frequency and strength of nuclear dust spirals in normal galaxies compared to agn .",

    "<S> we create detailed high - quality `` structure maps '' that allow us to study the distributions of dust , star clusters , and emission - line gas in the circumnuclear regions ( 100 - 1000 pc scales ) and in the associated host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> essentially all of these seyfert galaxies have circumnuclear dust structures with morphologies ranging from grand - design two - armed spirals to chaotic dusty disks . in most seyferts </S>",
    "<S> there is a clear physical connection between the nuclear dust spirals on hundreds of parsec scales and large - scale bars and spiral arms in the host galaxies proper . </S>",
    "<S> these connections are particularly striking in the interacting and barred galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> such structures are predicted by numerical simulations of gas flows in barred and interacting galaxies , and may be related to the fueling of agn by matter inflow from the host galaxy disks . </S>",
    "<S> we see no significant differences in the circumnuclear dust morphologies of seyfert 1s and 2s , and very few seyfert 2 nuclei are obscured by large - scale dust structures in the host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> if seyfert 2s are obscured seyfert 1s , then the obscuration must occur on smaller scales than those probed by hst .    </S>",
