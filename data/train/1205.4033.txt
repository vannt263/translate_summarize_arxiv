    "the observed flatness of the milky way s circular - velocity curve at galactocentric distances larger than 20 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) shows that the visible galactic disk is embedded in a massive dark halo .",
    "the disk is composed of gas and stars ( baryons ) , while the dark halo is believed to be composed of non - baryonic matter of unknown nature . despite the dominance of the dark halo in the outer parts of the milky way",
    ", it remains unclear from direct measurements whether there is any need for a substantial amount of dark matter to explain the circular - velocity curve interior to the solar radius , @xmath2 .",
    "quantitatively , the fraction of the total radial force at the solar radius that is due to the disk could be as high as 90% @xcite .",
    "a promising avenue for constraining the local density of dark matter is through a determination of the dependence of the gravitational potential on distance above the mid - plane of the disk ( `` height '' ) , from measuring the kinematics of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a major obstacle is that the uncertainty in the amount of baryonic matter in the disk makes it hard to determine the relative contributions from dark and baryonic matter to the density near the mid - plane .",
    "studies limited to heights @xmath3 pc are consistent with no dark matter near the sun , but they can not exclude the amount of dark matter expected for a standard dark - matter halo ( @xmath4 ; @xcite )",
    ".    the contributions from baryonic and dark matter can be disentangled by measuring the gravitational potential out to larger heights . at heights of several times",
    "the disk thickness , the dark halo and the baryonic disk contributions to the potential have a different vertical dependence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , most of the disk mass lies below @xmath5 , so above this height the disk contribution to the integrated surface density @xmath6 is roughly constant with height and the disk potential varies as @xmath7 , while the dark halo contributes @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , any measured increase in the surface density at @xmath10 must be due to the dark halo , and the expected increase is @xmath11 for each kpc ( for the standard value of the local dark matter density of @xmath12 ; see above ) .",
    "determinations of the surface density at @xmath13 from the plane typically find values of @xmath14 @xcite while the baryonic contribution is estimated to be around @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , these studies are consistent with the expected dark - matter density , although they do not go to large enough heights to detect the dark matter unambiguously .",
    "a recent study of the kinematics of stars with heights @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "if true , this would imply that dark matter is less abundant in the solar neighborhood than expected , by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "this would also shift experimental limits on the cross - section for elastic scattering between dark - matter particles and baryons by an order of magnitude , although this is far less than the uncertainty in the predicted cross - section .    in this paper , we show that the analysis used by mb12  is flawed .",
    "the main error is that they assume that the _ mean azimuthal _ ( or _",
    "_ r__otational ) _ velocity _ @xmath18 of their tracer population is independent of galactocentric cylindrical radius @xmath19 at all heights ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",

    ", the circular speed is larger by @xmath22 than the mean azimuthal velocity for the warm tracer population used by mb12 , a phenomenon known as asymmetric drift .",
    "the asymmetric drift _ is _ expected to vary with @xmath19although this variation can not be measured for the sample of mb12  as the data do not span a large enough range in @xmath19so the assumptions that @xmath18 and @xmath21 are independent of radius are not compatible . in the absence of a measurement of the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath18 for the tracers , we show that the assumption of an @xmath19-independent @xmath18 at all heights @xmath24 is highly implausible . by using instead the data - driven assumption that the circular speed is independent of radius at @xmath25 , we demonstrate that the measurements and analysis of mb12  are fully consistent with the standard estimate of the local dark matter density , approximately @xmath26 , and indeed provide the best available direct measurement of this quantity .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in @xmath27  [ sec : vphivcirc ] we discuss the assumption made by mb12  that the mean azimuthal velocity of the tracer population is independent of @xmath19 . in @xmath27  [ sec : poisson ] , we derive the surface density as a function of @xmath24 using the assumption that the circular - velocity curve is flat in the mid - plane and we discuss the effect of relaxing this approximation . in @xmath27  [",
    "sec : reanalysis ] , we calculate the surface density using the data of mb12  but using the approximation of constant circular speed and show that this leads to a surface density at @xmath28 that increases with height at the rate expected for a dark halo .",
    "our conclusions are in @xmath27  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we follow mb12  in defining @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 as the radial , azimuthal , and vertical velocities in cylindrical coordinates and the inertial galactocentric reference frame .",

    "the mean azimuthal velocity of a population of stars differs from the circular velocity due to the asymmetric drift .",

    "this figure shows the fractional difference between the true surface density and that calculated from equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) by approximating @xmath137 by its value in the plane .",

    "thus a systematic uncertainty of 10 to 20% in @xmath138 is unavoidable without fully modeling the potential .",
    "it is , however , possible to show that neglecting the @xmath24-dependence of @xmath130 almost always leads to an _ underestimate _ of the surface density , so this approximation gives a robust lower limit on the surface density .",
    "we start by writing the @xmath24 derivative of the integrand in equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) as @xmath139 if we again use the fact that @xmath140 , we find that @xmath141 if the first term in square brackets in equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) is neglected , we have @xmath108 ( at @xmath109 ) .",
    "this approximation is quite accurate if there is substantial mass in a thin disk and @xmath104 is small , or if the circular - speed curve is nearly flat , since then @xmath142 is almost independent of radius ( see  [ fig : approx ] ) .",

    "armed with this result , we can revisit the mb12  analysis .",
    "since the circular - speed curve is flat in the mid - plane , the integrand is zero in the mid - plane , so the approximation that the integrand is constant implies that the integral can be neglected . substituting equation ( [ eq : fz ] ) into equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) we find @xmath149\\,,\\ ] ] where we distinguish between the radial scale length @xmath52 of the tracer population and the radial scale length @xmath51 of the dispersion - squared .",

    "<S> an analysis of the kinematics of 412 stars at 1@xmath0 from the galactic mid - plane by moni bidin et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2012b ) has claimed to derive a local density of dark matter that is an order of magnitude below standard expectations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this result is incorrect and that it arises from the assumption that the mean azimuthal velocity of the stellar tracers is independent of galactocentric radius at all heights . </S>",
    "<S> we substitute the assumption , supported by data , that the circular speed is independent of radius in the mid - plane . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the assumption of constant mean azimuthal velocity is implausible by showing that it requires the circular velocity to drop more steeply than allowed by any plausible mass model , with or without dark matter , at large heights above the mid - plane . using the approximation that the circular velocity curve is flat in the mid - plane </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the data imply a local dark - matter density of @xmath1 , fully consistent with standard estimates of this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most robust direct measurement of the local dark - matter density to date . </S>"
