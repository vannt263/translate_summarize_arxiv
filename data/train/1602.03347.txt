    "the elisa project ( evolved laser interferometer space antenna ) of the european space agency@xcite with three satellites may perhaps be able to see the cosmic gravitational background ( cgb ) .",
    "recently the bicep2 collaboration@xcite claimed to have seen in the fluctuations and the polarization of the cmb fingerprints of the gravitational wave background originating from the inflationary expansion during the bb .",
    "but this was probably a to wishful interpretation of the data .",
    "the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb , often also called ` relic neutrinos ' ) decouples from matter about 1 second after the bb in the radiation dominated era at a temperature of @xmath11 kelvin @xmath12 1 mev .",
    "today due to the expansion and cooling of the universe the relic neutrino temperature is 1.95 kelvin and the average neutrino density in the universe is 340 per @xmath13 or 56 electron neutrinos per cm@xmath0 .",

    "@xcite interpreted data about damping of acoustic oscillations of the cosmic microwave background as an interaction with the cosmic neutrino background ( cnb ) .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) originates about 380 000 years after the bb at a temperature of around 3000 kelvin and is well studied .",
    "it was detected by penzias and wilson@xcite in 1964 ( nobel prize 1978 ) as byproduct of their search for possible perturbations of the communication with satellites .",
    "later on the cmb was confirmed and detailed by satellite observations@xcite .",

    "the decoupling of the neutrinos from matter is determined by the competition of the expansion rate of the universe ( hubble parameter ) and the interaction rate of the neutrinos with matter .",
    "the hubble parameter using the friedmann equation @xcite and the stefan - boltzmann law ( [ sb1 ] ) is given by : @xmath22 the universe expansion rate is given by the hubble parameter .",
    "it decreases with the square of the temperature .",
    "the variable ` a ' is any length scale describing the expansion of the universe .",
    "the neutrino reaction rate reduces with the fifth power @xmath23 of the decreasing temperature : @xmath24    when the hubble expansion rate ( [ hubble ] ) is getting faster or about equal to the neutrino reaction rate ( [ neutrinor ] ) , the neutrinos decouple from matter . @xmath25",

    "but it should be possible with katrin , in its present form , to determine an upper limit for the local relic neutrino density of the cnb .",
    "+ is it possible to increase the tritium source strength by factor 100 ? increasing the source strength one has to keep in mind the following requirements .    1 .",
    "* maximize detectable 18.6 kev electrons * , which contain the information on the neutrino mass and the capture of the relic neutrinos .",
    "* 1 ev energy resolution of the spectrometer . * 3 .",

    "only about @xmath50 decay electrons have not yet scattered .",
    "all the others including also electrons with the maximum energy , which contain the information on the neutrino mass and on the relic neutrino capture by tritium , are lost for the measurement @xcite .",
    "thus an increase of the tritium source strength beyond the 20 micrograms reduces the number of counts of 18.6 kev electrons and is counter productive .",
    "\\(ii ) if one request for the spectrometer an * energy resolution of 1 ev * , one can afford to have only 1 ev of energy in the spectrometer in the perpendicular cyclotron motion .",
    "the spectrometer can by an opposing electric field of around 18 600 volt control the longitudinal energy of the electron motion along the magnetic field lines and allow only electron to pass with energies around q = 18.562 kev .",
    "the information on the neutrino mass and on the capture of the neutrinos from the cnb lies close to the upper end point of the electron spectrum in the interval @xmath51 with a number ` a ' roughly between 2 and 20 .",
    "source @xmath52 focuses ideally half of the the electrons in forward direction .",
    "in reality @xmath53 contracts only part of the forward electrons into the transport channel with about 9 cm diameter .",
    "a to strong increase of the field @xmath53 yields a magnetic mirror and reflects all electrons .",
    "the electrons follow in cyclotron rotation the magnetic field lines .",
    "angular momentum conservation requests , that @xmath54 is constant along the electron trajectory .",
    "thus a small @xmath55 = 0.93 ev in the middle of the spectrometer requires there a weak magnetic field of about 3 gauss .",

    "+ the low magnetic field in the spectrometer of only 3 gauss is needed to transform the electron momenta , which are at the source almost perpendicular to the beam direction due to the cyclotron motion , into almost a translational direction ( see figure 9 of the katrin design report @xcite and figure [ spectrometer ] of this contribution ) , to reject with an electric opposing field all electrons almost up to the tritium q - value ( @xmath65 kev ) . to increase the source strength by a factor 100 with a corresponding increase of the source area to @xmath66 diameter , one needs also to increase the spectrometer cross section by a factor 100 or the diameter to about 90 m , which is not possible .",
    "\\(v ) * to focus a large number of 18.6 kev electrons at the source into the 9 cm wide transport channel * one needs the large magnetic field of 3.6 tesla .",
    "this then requires by magnetic flux conservation and the requirement of 1 ev energy resolution the large size of the spectrometer . with the resolution of @xmath67 ev katrin hopes to reduce the upper limit of the electron neutrino mass to about 0.2 ev @xmath68 .",
    "fitting at the upper end of the kurie plot at @xmath69 of the electron spectrum the katrin collaboration hopes to determine the q - value and the neutrino mass .",

    "+ the ` project 8 ' at santa barbara and mit wants to measure the electron antineutrino mass by the radiation emitted from the tritium beta decay electrons moving in cyclotron resonances ( rotations ) along a longitudinal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this requires special antennas along the electron trajectory from the source to the detector and a detailed analysis of the radiation spectrum .",
    "the opinion of the experts of the feasibility of this approach to determine the neutrino mass varies .",
    "+ the ptolemy project ( princeton tritium observatory for light , early - universe , massive - neutrino yield)@xcite of the princeton plasma physics laboratory wants to measure neutrinos from the cnb . the planned tritium source is exceptionally intense with a total mass of 100 grams .",
    "a single graphene layer backed by a substrate can bind tritium by sub - ev energies at each carbon intersection on the surface directly facing vacuum .",
    "maximal hydrogenation of the graphene surface achieves @xmath73 tritium atoms per cm@xmath6 .",
    "since the probability to scatter for one 18.6 kev electron on @xmath75c in one graphene layer is about 3.6 percent , one is limited to two or three stacked graphene layers ( see ref.@xcite page two ) .",
    "this limits the weight of tritium to about 1 microgram per @xmath76 with two layers .",
    "if one assumes two layers with 1 microgram per @xmath77 one needs for 100 grams of tritium roughly @xmath78 cm@xmath6 = 10 000 m@xmath6 of double graphene layers with a free way from the source to the detector .",
    "the ptolemy proposes a time - dependent system incorporating the project 8 antenna technology to significantly reduce the phase space requirements , in additional to alternative distributed geometries for the mac - e filter inspired by katrin .",
    "although the ptolemy collaboration discusses these problems in detail @xcite , it is obvious that such a source is extremely difficult to realize .      *",
    "the average relic electron neutrino number density of @xmath79 = 56 @xmath80 katrin yields only every 590 000 years a count from the cnb with katrin .",

    "estimates for this overdensity @xmath81 vary widely from about @xmath82 to @xmath83 and depend on the mass of the relic neutrinos . the very optimistic value of the local overdensity of @xmath45 yields with katrin 1.7 counts per year . increasing",
    "the effective mass of the tritium source from 20 micrograms to 2 milligrams would lead to 170 counts per year .",

    "* the second problem could be the energy resolution of the katrin spectrometer of @xmath84 = 0.93 ev .",
    "with this resolution katrin expects to extract from the electron spectrum at the upper end of the kurie plot at @xmath85 a very accurate q - value with an error of milli - ev or less and an upper limit of the electron antineutrino mass of about @xmath86 0.2 [ ev ] 90 @xmath87 c.l .. if one can fit the q value and the electron neutrino mass accurately enough , the position of the electron peak from the induced capture of the relic neutrinos is known to be at an electron energy of @xmath88 . the energy resolution and",
