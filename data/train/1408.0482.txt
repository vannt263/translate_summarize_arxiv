    "broadcast scenarios have been widely studied for video or audio broadcasting .",
    "more recently , the multimedia broadcast / multicast service ( mbms ) @xcite became a requirement of the long - term evolution ( lte ) specifications to support the delivery of broadcast / multicast data in lte systems .",
    "broadcast and multicast downlink transmissions make no significant difference at the physical layer",
    ". basically , broadcast services are available to all users without the need of subscribing to a particular service . therefore ,",
    "multicasting can thus be seen as `` broadcast via subscription '' , with the possibility of charging for the subscription @xcite .",
    "mbms is intended to be used for some content , such as streaming transmission of a sport or cultural event , but broadcasting may also be of interest to transmit some signalling such as a beacon for time synchronization or for power control purposes .",
    "we consider broadcasting under a green - aware objective aiming at reducing the energy consumption which is an important issue in wireless environments@xcite .",
    "broadcasting may bring a strong improvement in wireless channels since a common resource ( in frequency and/or time ) may be used for all destinations .",
    "the transmission cost for a base station ( bs ) to reach all nodes in a multicast group is assumed to be proportional to the power needed to reach the worst mobile among the group , where the worst refers to the mobile receiving the weaker signal which relies on its distance and on additional shadowing effects .",
    "we thus consider the situation where there is one common information that every mobile @xmath0 is interested to receive , and which can be obtained from any one of @xmath1 bss .",
    "the objective is then to achieve a mobiles assignment which _ minimizes the total power consumption_.    as mentioned above , this problem is relevant not only for streaming data transmission but also for signalling .",
    "a corollary question is indeed how many base stations should be kept active to ensure the signalling to a group of mobiles even when they are not transmitting . in low activity periods , such as during the night , it could be relevant to keep active only few bs ensuring the coverage of few active mobiles . indeed , energy consumption and electromagnetic pollution are main societal and economical challenges that developed countries have to handle .",
    "the evolution of cellular networks toward smaller cells offering theoretically higher capacity could in turn lead to an unacceptable increase of the energy expenditure of wireless systems .",
    "when decreasing the cell size , the energy consumed for data transmission becomes lower compared to the _ operational power costs _",
    "( e.g. power amplifiers , cooler , etc . ) of a typical bs . switching off a bs",
    "may then bring significant improvements in energy efficiency .",
    "therefore , we take into account the switching on / off operation in the problem formulation . the overarching problem studied in the sequel",
    "is then finding _ energy - efficient broadcast transmission techniques _ to reduce spurious energy using distributed schemes .",
    "the mobile assignment problem ( map ) in the context of broadcast transmission that we study in this work is actually a special case of the _ simple plant location problem _ ( splp ) @xcite .",
    "splp lies within _ clustering problems_. in the map , basically , the objective is to assign the points to at most @xmath2 clusters so that the sum of all distances between points in the same cluster ( @xmath2-clustering ) is minimized . in @xcite , the typical cost for a bs - mobile pair",
    "is assumed to be only a function of distance between the bs and the mobile , formulated as @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath4 is a",
    "_ cluster _ of mobiles assigned to bs @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the set of clusters , @xmath7 is the distance between mobile @xmath8 and bs @xmath5 , @xmath9 is the path loss exponent and @xmath10 is the operational power cost loaded to bs @xmath5 .",
    "this formulation is modified in order to consider the effect of shadowing leading to the following total cost @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the shadowing effect between mobile @xmath8 and bs @xmath5 .",
    "thus , this modification turns the map into the splp .",
    "while finding the global minimum of the map may be identified as an np - hard problem from splp literature , the large scale nature of the cellular network further requires to solve it in a decentralized manner .",
    "thus , game theory appears as a natural tool to cope with both features : distributed decision and np - hardness .",
    "we address this problem by considering the mobiles as players being able to make strategic decisions and the bss as the strategy identifiers : each mobile has to choose the best bs to be served",
    ".      computational geometric approaches to the map can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors examined the 1-dimensional version of the map , where the effects of shadowing and operational power cost are not taken into account .",
    "polynomial time solutions via dynamic programming are proposed . in @xcite , authors suggested approximation algorithms ( and an algebraic intractability result ) for selecting an optimal line on which to place bss to cover mobiles , and a proof of np - hardness for any path loss exponent @xmath13 .    the papers @xcite focused on source - initiated broadcasting of data in static all - wireless networks .",
    "data are distributed from a source node to each node in a network .",
    "the main objective is to construct a minimum - energy broadcast tree rooted at the source node .",
    "multi - hop routing is not the scope of our paper .    in @xcite , the combined problem of ( i ) deciding what subset of the mobiles",
    "would be assigned to each bs , and then ( ii ) sharing the bss cost of multicast among the mobiles is studied .",
    "the subset that is wished to assign to a given bs is said to be its target set of mobiles .",
    "this problem can be conceived as a coalitional pricing game played by mobiles which is called _ the association game of mobiles_.      we propose algorithmic solutions for mobile assignment in the context of broadcasting , in order to minimize the overall energy consumption related to transmission and operational powers . in this context , switching off some fraction of bss is considered to be a way of decreasing dramatically the total energy consumption .",
    "note however that heterogeneous networks include macro and small - cells with or without coordination .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that small - cells are subject to switching off operation while macro - cells are always turned on .",
    "they can indeed serve moving mobiles in order to decrease the number of hand - offs . further , since the small - cells are deployed intensively , their transmission power is lower than those of macro - cells , while their circuit power dominates .    comparing the transmission power about few milliwatts with the operational power costs which may approach tens of watts , turning off a fraction of bss is appealing for reducing the total energy footprint of the network .",
    "the efforts for turning off some bss will be concentrated on small - cells serving fixed mobiles@xcite .",
    "the referred literature mostly concentrates on the geometric aspects of the map where basically , the coverage area of a bs is assumed to be a disc which issues from omnidirectional antenna pattern .",
    "however , _",
    "the effect of shadowing _ , special designed _ antenna patterns _ as well as _ the operational power costs",
    "_ may impact the bs - mobile assignments . in this paper , we take into account these effects by introducing a _ power cost matrix _ containing all bs - mobile pairing power costs .",
    "furthermore , several papers working on coverage optimization deal with static optimization and planning from a centralized point of view .",
    "but the dynamic switching - off process associated to the large - scale nature of the network induces to find distributed solutions .",
    "to this end , we deal with this problem through a group formation game formulation .",
    "subsequently , we introduce a new algorithm based on group formation games , called _ hedonic decision algorithm_. this formalism is constructive : a new class of group formation games is introduced where the utility of players within a group is separable and symmetric .",
    "this is a generalization of parity affiliation games and this hedonic decision algorithm is in fact applicable for any set covering problem .    to prove the efficiency of this approach ,",
    "we then derive four other methods allowing to solve the initial problem .",
    "first , we propose a recursive algorithm called _ the hold minimum algorithm _ which solves the considered problem optimally .",
    "however , the hold minimum algorithm operates in a centralized way since it requires the whole knowledge for each bs - mobile pairing power cost .",
    "we then adapt an approach from the splp literature to the map : a centralized polynomial - time heuristic algorithm is proposed called the _ the column control _ which produces optimal assignments when taking into account the operational power cost .",
    "this algorithm is also extended to a distributed approach , where each mobile gathers the local information from the bss located in its range .",
    "on the other hand , _ the nearest base station algorithm _ , a distributed greedy algorithm which runs in polynomial - time is also evaluated .",
    "this algorithm is not efficient if the operational power cost is large , but is very efficient for the fast - moving users served by macro bss .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : genericproblem ] , the map is formulated mathematically as a clustering problem and different formulations are then proposed . in section [ sec : decentralized ] , the game framework and the hedonic decision algorithm are proposed . in section [ sec : efficientalgorithms ] , we derive other algorithmic solutions for the map and their complexity is anlayzed in section [ sec : timecomplexity ] . finally , we present simulation results in section [ sec : simulationresults ] and we expose some conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the coverage problem in the case of broadcast transmission in cellular networks .",
    "we assume that each bs transmits simultaneously to the mobiles .",
    "the distance between the mobile @xmath8 and bs @xmath5 is represented by @xmath7 .",
    "the power needed to receive the transmission is given by @xmath14 .",
    "we consider basic signal propagation model capturing path loss as well as shadowing effect formulated as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath9 denote transmitted power from bs @xmath5 to mobile @xmath8 and path loss exponent , respectively .",
    "the random variable @xmath17 is used to model slow fading effects and commonly follows a log - normal distribution .",
    "the required transmission power depends on the mobile having the worst signal level from the bs ( figure [ fig : broadcasttransmission ] ) . at this power level , all mobiles are guaranteed to receive a sufficient power .",
    "we also consider the operational power cost denoted as @xmath18 which captures the energy expenditure of a typical bs @xmath5 for operational costs ( power amplifiers , cooler , etc . ) .",
    "so , the total power cost ( transmission power + operational power cost ) of a typical transmission between bs @xmath5 and mobile @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath19 let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be the sets of mobiles and bss , respectively .",
    "representing the _ power cost matrix _",
    "@xmath22 , we assume @xmath23 where if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 ( @xmath26 denotes a maximal power , for instance , in wifi , it is @xmath27 mw ) .      clustering is a rich branch of combinatorial problems which have been extensively studied in many fields including database systems , image processing , data mining , molecular biology , etc .",
    "@xcite . consider the set of mobiles @xmath28 ; a _",
    "cluster _ is any non - empty subset of @xmath28 and a _ clustering _ is a partition of @xmath28 .",
    "many different clustering problems can be defined .",
    "the mostly studied problems are defined through their objective which is to assign the points to at most @xmath2 clusters so that either :    * _ k - centre _ : the maximum distance from any point to its cluster centre is minimized , * _ k - median _ : the sum of distances from each point to its closest cluster centre is minimized , * _ k - clustering _ : the sum of all distances between points in the same cluster is minimized .",
    "the problem of clustering a set of points into a specific number of clusters so as to minimize the sum of cluster sizes is referred to as min - size @xmath2-clustering problem . in @xcite , the typical cost for a bs - mobile pair",
    "is assumed to be only a function of the bs - mobile distance and leads to the formulation : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a _ cluster _ of mobiles assigned to bs @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the set of clusters , @xmath7 is the distance between mobile @xmath8 and bs @xmath5 , @xmath9 is the path loss exponent , @xmath10 is the operational power cost loaded to bs @xmath5 . since in this paper , we add the effect of shadowing to such a cost , the cost function becomes @xmath11 .",
    "note that the shadowing effect breaks the monotonicity with @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig : broadcasttransmission ] ) and then shifts the problem to a _ simple plant location problem _ ( splp ) @xcite formulated as follows :    * let have @xmath29 potential facility locations .",
    "a facility can be opened in any location @xmath30 ; opening a facility location has a non - negative cost corresponding to @xmath31 in the map .",
    "each open facility can provide an unlimited amount of commodity corresponding to unlimited number of mobiles served by a bs in the map ; * there are @xmath32 customers that require a service .",
    "the goal is to determine a subset of the set of potential facility locations , at which to open facilities and an assignment of all clients to these facilities so as to minimize the overall total cost .",
    "however , the splp formulation presents a very high complexity , and we rather propose to turn out the problem as a set covering problem , starting from a binary integer formulation .",
    "note that there are at most @xmath33 possible subsets of @xmath34 .",
    "each subset can be associated to any bs and the number of combinations is given by @xmath35 .",
    "we note @xmath36 the collection of total possibilities .",
    "the index set of @xmath36 is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a 0 - 1 matrix with @xmath39 if the node @xmath2 ( i.e. mobile or bs ) belongs to the set @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be an @xmath42-dimensional vector .",
    "the value @xmath43 represents the optimal power of @xmath44 by which we denote a pair which consists of a set of mobiles @xmath45 assigned to bs @xmath5 .",
    "clearly @xmath46 the formulation of this problem is given by @xmath47 where the term @xmath48 imposes that only one bs is associated to a mobile . by this way",
    ", we do not let a mobile to be assigned to several bss .",
    "it follows that the optimal clustering is denoted as @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the optimal pairing .",
    "thanks to this formulation , we can show that the map may be derived as a set partitioning problem .",
    "in the map , the set @xmath28 is associated with another set @xmath52 . therefore , the collection @xmath36 contains those subsets of @xmath28 each of which is associated with every element of the set @xmath52 .",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let us have a power cost matrix given by @xmath53 the collection of total possibilities : @xmath54 recall that @xmath40 denotes the cluster of mobiles @xmath45 assigned to bs @xmath5 .",
    "the optimal values for each possibility is given by @xmath55 .",
    "then , we define the following matrix : @xmath56 the optimal total power is thus calculated by the following binary integer program : @xmath57 the values @xmath58 and @xmath59 result in the optimal total power of the example scenario , i.e. , @xmath60 with the optimal clustering @xmath61 .    however , set partitioning problems are well known to be np - hard @xcite .",
    "consequently , the map being a special set partitioning problem is also np-hard.in the next section , we propose to reduce this complexity .",
    "the previous formulation stated that a unique bs is allowed to serve a mobile . however in terms of pure coverage considerations , the optimal solution may feature some mobiles to be covered by several bs , no matter to which bs the mobile eventually associate with .",
    "we then relax the condition of associating only one bs to a cluster of mobiles in @xmath62 such that it is now possible to have a cluster of mobiles covered by more than one bs : @xmath63 .",
    "thus , this arrangement turns the map into so called _ set covering _ problem .",
    "consider a set of mobiles @xmath64 assigned to bs @xmath5 noted as @xmath65 .",
    "when a group of mobiles @xmath66 deviates to another bs @xmath2 then the cost due to @xmath64 becomes additive .",
    "let the cost of @xmath65 and @xmath67 be @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "we denote the total cost before deviation of @xmath70 as @xmath71 and after deviation of @xmath70 as @xmath72 , respectively , which can be given by @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the remaining costs before and after deviation , respectively .",
    "there is always a potential ( probability ) increasing the total cost when a deviation occurs , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "for better observation , let us consider the following power cost matrix : @xmath78 let @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 resulting in the following total costs : @xmath84 where @xmath85 .    utilizing this property ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we delete from the collection @xmath36 all those assignments @xmath86 whenever the cost of @xmath65 is equal to the cost of @xmath86 such that @xmath66 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for example , let us consider the last example where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 , all possible assignments are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 corresponding to the cost vector @xmath97 .",
    "note that the cost of @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath96 are equal each other .",
    "therefore , we remove @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 from the collection . the reduced collection of assignments becomes as following : @xmath101 note that this property is an extension of the geometric `` coverage range '' .",
    "if the shadowing was not considered , this approach would reduced to defining the maximal coverage range .",
    "but with shadowing the mobile requiring the most power is not always the further one .",
    "thus , the binary integer program of finding the solution of the problem is given by @xmath102 the solution of this problem is found to be @xmath103 and @xmath104 which fits to the optimal one .",
    "by such an elimination , the size of the collection of assignments reduces from @xmath105 to @xmath106 . this",
    "prove that the set - covering formulation is much more efficient than the set - partitioning one .",
    "enumerating all possible solutions and choosing the one which produces the lowest cost is known as brute - force search or generate and test .",
    "we represent by @xmath107 the _ assignment matrix _ where @xmath108 .",
    "if mobile @xmath8 is assigned to bs @xmath5 , then @xmath109 , otherwise @xmath110 .",
    "notice that each row of the assignment matrix includes only unique `` 1 '' which means that a mobile is served by only one bs , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "this is not in contradiction with our former remark about the possibility of having a mobile covered by several bs . here",
    "now , we decide to associate a mobile to a bs .",
    "so if a mobile is covered by several bss , the serving bs can be anyone of this covering set . denoting the collection of the assignment matrices @xmath112 ,",
    "actually , we formalize the problem as following : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the element - wise product .",
    "note that the total number of possibilities of assignment matrices can be calculated as @xmath115 .",
    "we now turn to the study of decentralized methods for solving the map .",
    "our approach is based on _ group formation game _ ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a group formation game is represented by a triple @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the set of _ players _ ( i.e. the mobiles ) , @xmath52 is the set of _ strategies _",
    "( i.e. the bss ) shared by all the players and @xmath118 is the _ utility function _ of player @xmath119 .",
    "each player @xmath120 chooses exactly one element from the @xmath1 alternatives in @xmath52 .",
    "the choices of players are represented by @xmath121 which is called the _ strategy - tuple _",
    "( @xmath122 shows the strategy chosen by player @xmath123 ) .",
    "a _ partition _ of players according to strategy - tuple @xmath124 is denoted as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the group of players choosing the strategy @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the two following conditions and we will see later how we can define the utilities to achieve these conditions :    1 .",
    "* separability * : the utility of any player in any group is said to be _",
    "separable _ if its utility can always be split as a sum according to : @xmath127 where @xmath128 may be interpreted as the gain of player @xmath129 from player @xmath130 if @xmath129 chooses strategy @xmath131 .",
    "note that @xmath132 is the utility of player @xmath129 when it is the only player choosing strategy @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the separability property states that utility transfers among a group of users sharing the same strategy is done such that the utility granted to one user is a sum of utilities granted individually by each partner in the group .",
    "* symmetricity * : the utility is said to be _ symmetric _ if the individual gain of @xmath129 from @xmath130 is equal to the gain of @xmath130 from @xmath129 when they both share the same strategy @xmath133 : @xmath134 therefore , this symmetric utility can be referred to as : @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137 is called the _ symmetric bipartite utility _ of player @xmath129 and @xmath130 while the common strategy is @xmath133 .    actually , the game defined above is a straightforward generalization of party affiliation games @xcite .",

    "this is exactly the case when @xmath170 .",
    "2 .   when @xmath171 increases a mobile may decide to leave its nearest neighbour if the lost in power is compensated by the second term .",
    "suppose that the mobile wants to associate to a bs @xmath172 , where all other mobiles currently associated with experience a better channel .",
    "then the gain to associate to this second bs for this user will be @xmath173 , i.e. the sum of all powers of mobiles already associated with this bs , weighted by @xmath163 .",
    "it is clear that the mobile will be joining either a cell having already strong power terms or a huge number of users .",
    "if @xmath163 becomes very large , we can expect that all mobiles will converge to the same bs which means that only one bs is active .",
    "consider the setting in which only one player decides its strategy .",
    "it is called as _ best - reply dynamics _ when a player chooses the strategy which maximizes its utility .",
    "when there is no any player which can improve its utility , then this network topology , i.e. @xmath174 , corresponds to a nash equilibrium .",

    "<S> this paper addresses the mobile assignment problem in a multi - cell broadcast transmission seeking minimal total power consumption by considering both transmission and operational powers . </S>",
    "<S> while the large scale nature of the problem entails to find distributed solutions , game theory appears to be a natural tool . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel distributed algorithm based on group formation games , called _ the hedonic decision algorithm_. this formalism is constructive : a new class of group formation games is introduced where the utility of players within a group is separable and symmetric being a generalized version of parity - affiliation games . the proposed hedonic decision algorithm is also suitable for any set - covering problem . to evaluate the performance of our algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we propose other approaches to which our algorithm is compared . </S>",
    "<S> we first develop a centralized recursive algorithm called _ the hold minimum _ being able to find the optimal assignments . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the np - hard complexity of the mobile assignment problem , we propose a centralized polynomial - time heuristic algorithm called _ the column control _ producing near - optimal solutions when the operational power costs of base stations are taken into account . starting from this efficient centralized approach , a _ distributed column control algorithm _ </S>",
    "<S> is also proposed and compared to _ the hedonic decision algorithm_. we also implement the nearest base station algorithm which is very simple and intuitive and efficiently manage fast - moving users served by macro bss . </S>",
    "<S> extensive simulation results are provided and highlight the relative performance of these algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated scenarios are done according to poisson point processes for both mobiles and base stations .    </S>",
