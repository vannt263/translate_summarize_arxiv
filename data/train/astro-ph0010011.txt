    "at least 11 of the nearly 5 dozen known am her variables are true eclipsing binaries where light curves through eclipse can be used to analyze the structure and relative importance of emission regions on the magnetic white dwarf and in the accretion column that connects it to the mass - losing companion .",
    "the eclipsing systems are found with magnetic field strengths @xmath8  mg ( mg @xmath9  g ) , span the orbital period range @xmath10  hr , and include one asynchronous system .",
    "thus , there is reasonable assurance that an understanding gained from the eclipsing systems can be applied to the class as a whole ( see cropper 1990 for a general review ) .    because the magnetic field funnels accreting gas onto impact regions as small as @xmath11 , high time resolution , @xmath12  s , plus an adequate photon rate are required to resolve the structures .",
    "the wavelength region of choice is the ultraviolet , where the white dwarf and heated impact region are prominent ( @xmath13  k and @xmath14  k , respectively ) , line and continuum emission from the funnel gas is available , and the contribution from the late - type secondary star is minimized .",
    "the first two papers in this series presented _ hst _ time - resolved spectroscopy of dp leo ( stockman et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter paper i ) and uz for ( stockman & schmidt 1996 , hereafter paper ii ) ; the latter study also applied the method to st lmi , where the accretion footpoint undergoes `` self - eclipse '' when it rotates behind the white dwarf limb .",
    "dp leo was observed in a state of very low accretion , nevertheless the eclipse light curves revealed the contribution of an accretion - heated spot ( @xmath15  k ) against the surrounding white dwarf photosphere ( @xmath16  k ) .",
    "the fractional surface area of the near - uv spot , @xmath17 , was found to be very similar to that of the optical cyclotron source in a high state .",
    "observations of uz for showed that the accretion stream itself can be a dominant uv source in an active accretion state , owing to both strong resonance line emission and free - bound continua .",
    "the temperature of the hot spot was measured at @xmath18  k and found to occupy at least @xmath19 of the white dwarf surface area .",
    "attempts to model the line emission led to a two - phase composition for the gas stream , consisting of low filling - factor , dense clumps threading a more rarefied flow .",
    "many of the observed properties of uz for in the uv are shared by the well - studied hu aqr ( e.g. , schwope 1998 ) , and similar conclusions have been reached .    in this paper",
    "we present faint object spectrograph ( fos ) spectroscopy of the final 4 eclipsing magnetic cataclysmic variables ( mcvs ) observed in this program .",
    "all four are relatively bright when actively accreting , @xmath20 , and together display an interesting variety of properties : v1309  ori  is the longest - period am her system known , with an eclipse persisting for more than 40  min . given the rather modest magnetic field of @xmath21  mg , spin - orbit locking in this binary challenges current theories of the magnetic interaction mechanism .",
    "in the high state , mn  hya  is a classic 2-pole accretion system whose strong optical polarization enables detailed models . the weakest magnetic field measured on any am her system is found on v2301  oph , a characteristic which has frustrated polarimetrists but motivated a number of photometric and spectroscopic analyses .",
    "aql  is the only one of the 4 for which an eclipse by the secondary star is in doubt ; it is also the sole asynchronous eclipsing system , made all the more unusual because the spin period appears to _ exceed _ the orbital period by 0.3% .",
    "these and other properties of the systems are summarized together with basic references to previous work in table  1 .    recently , several sophisticated techniques used to study the emission of disk cvs have found their way to magnetic systems .",
    "these include doppler tomography ( e.g. , schwope et al .",
    "1999 ) and maximum entropy methods ( mem ) for modeling eclipse light curves in broad bands ( harrop - allin , hakala , & cropper 1999b ; harrop - allin et al .",
    "1999a ) as well as of full - orbit phase - resolved emission - line spectroscopy ( sohl & wynn 1999 ; vrielmann & schwope 1999 ; kube , gnsicke , & beuermann 2000 ) .",
    "several of these approaches utilize genetic algorithms ( e.g. , hakala 1995 ) to efficiently approach global optimization of the many model variables .",
    "each of the methods has its strengths and limitations .",
    "doppler tomography maps the velocity distribution of emitting regions , not their locations , and the technique is insensitive to motions out of the orbital plane ( see , e.g. , schwope et al . 1999 ) .",
    "mem and genetic optimization codes were developed in an attempt to deal with the tremendous ambiguity of generalized model - fitting approaches , where the number of emitting sources may exceed the number of independent data points .",
    "the various tools are in many ways complementary and together represent the state - of - the - art in analytical techniques for time - resolved studies of accretion binaries .",
    "we have chosen to apply a more qualitative approach to interpret the eclipse light curves of these mcvs for several reasons .",
    "first , the photon rate in the near - uv from _ hst_+fos can not compete with what is now commonplace from modern instrumentation and large ground - based telescopes working in the visible ( @xmath1@xmath22 m ) .",
    "this , plus the low spectral resolution of fos effectively rule out quantitative doppler studies of the emission lines .",
    "time allocation considerations on _ hst _ limited the observing program on each source to windows just encompassing eclipse , and for some targets scheduling constraints precluded obtaining both ingress and egress at the same epoch .",
    "with such limitations , the data presented here are amenable to identifying the location and relative importance of principle sources of line and continuum emission , but not for unraveling their detailed structure or kinematics .",
    "time - resolved uv spectra of v1309  ori , mn  hya , v2301  oph , and v1432  aql  were obtained with _ hst _ at several epochs between 1996 aug . 3 and 1996 dec . 24 ( cycle 6 , post - costar ) , as recorded in table  2 .",
    "setup of the fos was as follows : the g160l grating and 0.86  square c-1 aperture pair to provide a spectral coverage of @xmath23 , 2@xmath24 substepping for a resolution of @xmath17   ; rapid readout mode with a time resolution of 0.8201  s per spectrum ; and 5@xmath24 overstepping to eliminate gaps caused by dead diodes .",
    "data calibration was carried out as in papers  i and ii , using the _ calfos _ reduction pipeline .",
    "observations of v1309  ori  and v1432  aql  were obtained at several epochs each : the former to adequately cover the long eclipse and the latter to sample the range of eclipse behavior shown by this asynchronous system .",
    "the eclipse interval of v2301  oph  was missed in the initial observation due to a spacecraft scheduling error , and the object was revisited a month later .",
    "even then , egress was not adequately covered .",
    "mn  hya  was found in a very faint state in the first pointing but had brightened by an order of magnitude upon a second visit 70 days later .    the low accretion state of mn  hya  in mid - oct .",
    "1996 was confirmed by a contemporaneous ground - based spectrum that showed a visual magnitude @xmath25 and no obvious emission lines .",
    "this and a number of other supporting optical observations were obtained over the time period of the spacecraft observations . in the cases of v1309  ori , mn  hya , and v2301  oph ,",
    "the blue channel spectrograph of the mmt provided flux - calibrated spectra covering the range @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , a full orbital cycle of unfiltered photometry and circular polarimetry with a time resolution of @xmath145  s was acquired during an active phase of mn  hya  on 1996 jan . 27",
    "( 9 months prior to the initial _ hst _ visit ) with the octopol polarimeter attached to the 2.3  m bok telescope of steward observatory .",
    "a @xmath27    eclipse light curve of the same object with 128  ms time samples was obtained on 1996 mar .",
    "10 using a programmed - readout mode of the ccd in the mmt red channel spectrograph ( schmidt , weymann , & foltz 1989 ) . for this observation ,",
    "the disperser was replaced by a plane mirror and both the target and a nearby comparison star were located in the spectrograph slit .",
    "the light curve of the latter object enabled a quality eclipse profile of mn  hya  despite the presence of light clouds .",
    "finally , occasional spectra and circular spectropolarimetry spanning @xmath1@xmath28 were obtained with the ccd spectropolarimeter ( schmidt , stockman , & smith 1992 ) attached to the steward observatory 2.3  m telescope .",
    "the ground - based observations are also summarized in table  2 .",
    "light curves were prepared from the time - resolved uv spectroscopy in 4 wavelength bandpasses in a manner similar to the procedure described in papers  i and ii .",
    "the wavebands extracted from the dispersed spectrum are : a near - uv interval ( nuv ; @xmath29 ) ; the far - uv continuum ( fuv ; @xmath30 excluding @xmath51397 ) ; and the emission lines  @xmath31 +  @xmath32 , constructed by summing a pair of continuum - subtracted bands covering @xmath33    and @xmath34   .",
    "in addition , a `` white - light '' curve was derived from the zero - order undispersed image .",
    "this bandpass has an effective width of @xmath11900    for these sources and central wavelength of @xmath13400   .",
    "the light curves for v1309  ori , mn  hya , v2301  oph , and v1432  aql  are shown as montages plotted vs. orbital phase in figures  @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "an approximate absolute calibration of the 3 uv channels in units of flux per detected count per 0.82 s sample is : + : 2.0@xmath36 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath38 ; fuv : 9.3@xmath39 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath38 @xmath38 ; nuv : 7.4@xmath40 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath38 @xmath38 .",
    "note that the two continuum bands are characterized per unit wavelength .",
    "neither v1309  ori  nor v2301  oph  displayed discernible variations in eclipse shape over the various epochs , in the former despite a span of more than 2 months .",
    "for these objects , mean light curves are shown .",
    "mn  hya  was too faint in the initial visit to provide useful data so only the second data set is displayed .",
    "it should be noted that the quoted accuracies of all ephemerides ( table  1 ) are sufficient to phase the data presented here to an accuracy of @xmath41 for all but v1309  ori , where the uncertainty is @xmath42 .",
    "the mean spectrum of each of the 4 objects as it emerged from the processing pipeline showed evidence for the 2200    silicate depression due to interstellar absorption . using the extinction curve from cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) and @xmath43 ,",
    "corrections were applied to each spectrum with an eye toward producing as smooth a continuum as possible in the region @xmath1@xmath44 .",
    "the results , quoted in table  1 , indicate visual extinctions in the range @xmath45  mag , with uncertainties of @xmath46  mag .    for typical system parameters ,",
    "eclipse by the secondary of a point on the white dwarf has a maximum duration of @xmath47 ( @xmath1@xmath48  min total length ) , with a weak dependence on binary period .",
    "eclipse transition across the white dwarf disk itself requires a phase interval @xmath49 ( at least 30  s ) , with the inequality reflecting the dependence on primary star mass , orbital period ( greater for shorter @xmath50 ) , and inclination ( greater for smaller @xmath51 ) .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. uz for , paper ii ) have found that the accretion column is a strong source of not only line emission , but also optical - uv continuum .",
    "because the gas stream approaches the primary in a curved , prograde path ( see , e.g. , lubow & shu 1975 ) and dynamically couples to the magnetic field en route , covering of the accretion column can commence prior to the white dwarf eclipse and continue long after .",
    "moreover , depending on the colatitude of the impact region on the star , the stream may arc out of the orbital plane and undergo only a partial eclipse . at the accretion shock",
    ", optical - ir cyclotron emission typically originates over a region of the stellar surface with @xmath52 . a somewhat larger portion of the disk @xmath53 is heated by low - level accretion or the euv - bright base of the accretion column to a characteristic temperature @xmath54  ev .",
    "for a circular profile , eclipse of this hot spot will produce an abrupt drop in the fuv flux over an interval 1  s @xmath55  s , depending on the observed waveband .",
    "the smallest spots are not resolvable at our sampling frequency ( and measured uv count rates ) .",
    "therefore , the baseline behavior that we expect through eclipse is : 1 )  initially a gradual extinction of the emission - line flux , beginning with the gas stream near the secondary and proceeding along the flow ; 2 )  a brief decline in the white light and nuv continuum bands that is well - resolved at the fos sampling rate , corresponding to the limb of the secondary beginning to pass over the white dwarf disk ; 3 )  an abrupt , possibly unresolved , drop in the fuv and to a lesser extent , the nuv bands , as the accretion - heated spot on the white dwarf is eclipsed .",
    "this transition will very nearly coincide with a similar extinction of the cyclotron flux in the white light channel .",
    "continuing through the light curve , we find 4 )  the conclusion of the resolved white dwarf eclipse ; 5 )  continued obscuration of the prograde portion of the gas stream ; 6 )  a period of nearly constant minimum light lasting up to several minutes ; and 7 )  @xmath56  11 ) an egress sequence that is a vertically - mirrored repeat of steps 1 )  @xmath56  5 ) , in order , as each component is progressively exposed .",
    "barring changes in viewing perspective or in the beaming factor of an emission component , amplitudes of corresponding ingress / egress transitions will be identical .",
    "the rosetta stone for this basic behavior is uz for ( paper ii ) .",
    "v1309  ori  has the longest orbital period of the known am her binaries at 7.98  hr .",
    "the uv ( figure  5 ) and optical spectra ( garnavich et al .",
    "1994 ; shafter et al .",
    "1995 ) are dominated by continuum and line emission from the accretion stream .",
    "buckley & shafter ( 1995 ) report the detection of weak , variable circular polarization in a white - light optical bandpass .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of the system obtained by us in 1994 nov .",
    "( not shown ) confirm a low level of polarization for the system ( @xmath57 ) as well as the existence of cyclotron emission harmonics centered near @xmath58 in both total flux and polarization .",
    "identifying these with harmonic numbers @xmath59 , respectively , we substantiate previous estimates of the primary magnetic field strength near 61  mg ( garnavich et al . 1994 ; shafter et al .",
    "1995 ; harrop - allin et al .",
    "the polarization appears to vary synchronously on the orbital period and is probably strongly diluted by light from the accretion stream .",
    "it is remarkable that such a wide binary can maintain synchronism given the implied accretion rate and modest magnetic field ( see also frank , lasota , & chanmugam 1995 and harrop - allin et al .",
    "1997 ) . nevertheless , the 1996 uv light curves shown in figure  1 are so similar to published visible - light profiles from @xmath60 ( e.g. shafter et al .",
    "1995 ) , and so unlike the variable light curves exhibited by asynchronous systems ( e.g. ,  3.5 ) , that we conclude the spin and orbital motions are indeed locked .",
    "interestingly , v1309  ori  displays an extremely peculiar x - ray behavior ( walter , scott , & adams 1995 ; de martino et al .",
    "1998 ) , accreting in bursts as short as a few seconds duration whose local @xmath61 values fall in the domain of buried accretion shocks ( beuermann & woelk 1996 ) , and which cool primarily in the soft x - rays ( e.g. , szkody 1999 )",
    ". this extreme flickering does not appear in the uv light curves recorded by fos .",
    "the v1309  ori  eclipse light curves shown in figure  1 and at an expanded scale in figure  6 confirm the dominance of the accretion stream in the uv . apart from inflections in the continuum bands at the beginnings of ingress and egress , all four channels display protracted transitions ( @xmath62 ) . the lack of sharp transitions in the white - light continuum places an upper bound on the cyclotron emission in this band ( @xmath635% ) .",
    "the inflections themselves are of approximately the correct duration ( @xmath64 ) to ascribe to an eclipse of the white dwarf , but this explanation requires a hot photosphere , @xmath65  k. the interpretation is also complicated by the simultaneous egress of the line - emission region at @xmath66 as is evidenced by the emission - line channel .    on the other hand ,",
    "a sharp drop in the fuv channel at @xmath67 is strong evidence for the presence of an accretion - heated spot on the white dwarf .",
    "the data are sufficiently noisy that we show this light curve in figure  6 after smoothing by a running mean of width 10 samples ( 8  s ) .",
    "the ingress time for the spot as measured from the two contacts @xmath68 indicated in the figure is @xmath69  s , implying that the transition is unresolved in the smoothed data .",
    "we therefore can set only an upper limit to the azimuthal extension of the spot as @xmath70@xmath71  cm .",
    "the implied covering factor for a circular spot on a 0.6  @xmath72 white dwarf is @xmath73 , possibly larger if the star is over - massive .",
    "the reduction in fuv flux corresponding to this drop is @xmath12.2 counts sample@xmath38 , or a dereddened flux of @xmath74 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath38 @xmath38 at an effective wavelength of @xmath11400",
    " . for a distance @xmath75  pc ,",
    "the corresponding blackbody temperature is @xmath2  k ( @xmath76  ev ) .",
    "for v1309  ori , removal of the 2200    feature was accomplished with a minor amount of absorption , @xmath77  mag , despite a distance of at least 500  pc .",
    "the dereddened spectra are shown in figure  5 and characterized by the line strength measurements compiled in table  3 .",
    "out of eclipse , v1309  ori  shows the high excitation line @xmath51370 as well as extraordinarily strong @xmath51240 .",
    "the lines persist weakly through eclipse ( @xmath78 ) , attesting to a small , continuously - exposed portion of the funnel or corona on the secondary star .",
    "the remarkable strength of @xmath79 has already been noted by szkody & silber ( 1996 ) from an _ iue _ spectrum .",
    "the ratio @xmath79/@xmath80 is exceeded among known mcvs only by by  cam at one epoch ( bonnet - bidaud & mouchet 1987 ; shrader et al .",
    "1988 ) ; indeed among mcvs in general this ratio rarely approaches unity . with @xmath130",
    "ev separating the ionization stages , the very large ratio implies at minimum a hot ionizing continuum and high density conditions .",
    "however , more detailed analysis by bonnet - bidaud & mouchet found that the line ratios for by  cam were so extreme that a nitrogen enhancement was indicated .",
    "proposed enrichment mechanisms included accretion from a companion whose hydrogen - rich layers had already been stripped , or mixing of normal stellar material with nuclear - processed matter : either nova ejecta or possibly surface material of the white dwarf .",
    "for stripping of an initially main - sequence secondary , the orbital period of v1309  ori  would require that well over a solar mass of material has been shed by the secondary over the lifetime of the binary  a very unlikely scenario .",
    "the fact that the / , /  line ratios place v1309  ori  precisely atop the tight grouping of 4 of the 5 measurements for by  cam ( bonnet - bidaud & mouchet 1987 ) would seem to argue against a mechanism that involves mixing of unprocessed and processed material  either from a previous nova eruption or from within the secondary star . nevertheless , a nitrogen abundance anomaly would seem to be the best explanation since @xmath51718 is also overly strong in both systems relative to the other atomic species ( figure  5 and table  3 ) .",
    "the interpretation of mn  hya  is relatively straightforward .",
    "except for the eclipse , circular polarization varies smoothly from @xmath5620% to + 10% through the 3.39  hr period ( buckley et al .",
    "our orbit of polarimetry displayed in figure  7 exhibits this behavior at a time resolution of 45  s ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the presence of both senses of polarization during the orbital cycle indicates a 2-pole accretion system .",
    "ramsay & wheatley ( 1998 ; cf .",
    "buckley et al .",
    "1998b ) have proposed a model in which a dominant , positively - polarized pole is hidden behind the stellar limb except during the interval @xmath82 .",
    "a weaker , negatively - polarized pole is visible between @xmath83 and responsible for the strong polarization around the time of eclipse . though a portion of our optical light curve is complicated by the passage of clouds ,",
    "the polarization curve is unaffected and consistent with this interpretation .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath84-wave in circular polarization in the interval @xmath85 can be explained in this model as the successive disappearance of the negative pole and appearance of the positive pole over the white dwarf limb , with the double sign change due to viewing each of the slightly elevated shocks `` from below '' ( ref .",
    "the polarization undershoot in vv pup ; liebert & stockman 1979 ) .",
    "a flux minimum at this time is consistent with the grazing viewing aspect of both accretion regions .",
    "our single epoch of fos spectroscopy of mn  hya  presented in figure  2 shows sharp , well - defined transitions in the white - light and nuv bands , indicating a compact cyclotron - emitting shock .",
    "very little flux is detected in the two high - frequency channels .",
    "the light curves closely resemble optical eclipse profiles measured by buckley et al .",
    "( 1998a ) but are quite unlike the x - ray light curve ( buckley et al .",
    "1998b ) , where a broadened eclipse and hardening of the spectrum indicates absorption by the intervening accretion stream . in figure  8 the fos white - light and nuv curves are compared to an eclipse profile obtained on 1996 mar .",
    "10 with the mmt using a ccd continuously clocked at a rate of 7.8 rows s@xmath38 . in the latter curve ,",
    "the effective time resolution is set by the fwhm of the seeing profile at @xmath86  s , similar to the fos data .",
    "ingress and egress of the bright spot are measured from the optical light curves as @xmath87  s , and @xmath88  s , i.e. essentially unresolved .",
    "the implied linear dimension on the white dwarf is @xmath63@xmath89  cm ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "a non - zero flux and concave profile through minimum light is common to at least the white - light and nuv channels .",
    "the uv spectrum from the eclipse interval , @xmath91 , shown in figure  9 , exhibits strong emission lines superposed on a weak , rather red , continuum .",
    "clearly , a small portion of the stream remains exposed even at mid - eclipse .",
    "the extinction correction for mn  hya  was based on the out - of - eclipse spectrum and amounts to only @xmath92  mag .",
    "it is important to note that , like v1309  ori , mn  hya  is characterized by an unusually strong @xmath79 line , with the flux ratio @xmath79/  @xmath93 .",
    "once again , @xmath51718 appears to be present .",
    "when gauged according to the / , / ratios , mn  hya  falls in the gap between the extreme objects by  cam and v1309  ori , and the remaining 9 mcvs available to bonnet - bidaud & mouchet ( 1987 ) , all of which have @xmath79/  @xmath94 , @xmath79/ @xmath95 . to that latter group",
    "we can add uz  for and st  lmi ( paper ii ) , and v2301  oph  and v1432  aql  ( szkody & silber 1996 ; friedrich , staubert , & la dous 1996a ; this study  table  3 ) .",
    "thus , the emission - line spectra of by  cam , v1309  ori , and to a lesser extent , mn  hya , remain anomalous .      with the lowest mean surface field yet measured for any",
    "am her system ( @xmath96  mg ) , v2301  oph  is probably synchronized only because it is also very compact ( @xmath97  hr ) .",
    "the suggestion that the binary may house a small accretion disk ( silber et al .",
    "1994 ) has not found support in subsequent studies , all of which indicate a system accreting solely via a stream ( barwig , ritter , & brnbantner 1994 ; ferrario et al .",
    "1995 ; hessman et al . 1997",
    "; simi et al .",
    "1998 ; steiman - cameron & imamura 1999 ) .",
    "with such a weak field , circular polarization has eluded detection , and thus far there is no indication of the orientation of the white dwarf within the binary",
    ".    the uv light curves shown in figure  3 record one clean ingress but only the latter portion of egress prior to the center of minimum light , as has been found in other studies . ] . in the expanded plot shown as figure  10 , ingress in the optical and nuv",
    "is seen to be composed of a well - resolved ledge beginning at @xmath98 and a final decline to minimum light at @xmath99 . from nearly coincident optical and x - ray photometry",
    ", steiman - cameron & imamura ( 1999 ) showed that the x - ray eclipse is complete , with ingress occurring during the optical ledge and x - ray egress near @xmath100 .",
    "the totality of eclipse at short wavelengths is confirmed by our nuv , fuv , and light curves .",
    "in addition , the dereddened ( @xmath101  mag ) eclipse spectrum shown in figure  11 exhibits neither significant continuum nor line emission . the optical decline that extends from @xmath102 to 0.993 implies a source much larger than the white dwarf , and was interpreted by steiman - cameron & imamura ( 1999 ) to be the extinguishing of the prograde portion of the accretion stream .",
    "the idea is verified by the similarity to our  light curve over this phase interval .",
    "we return to this point below .    in figure  10",
    "we identify contact points @xmath103 and @xmath104 with ingress and egress of the ledge in the nuv , and measure a time interval @xmath105  s or @xmath106 .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the @xmath150  s duration measured in a broad optical bandpass by steiman - cameron & imamura ( 1999 ) , but is still comparable in size to the disk of a white dwarf ( @xmath1@xmath107  cm ) , and we follow their assignment as such . within this interval ,",
    "points @xmath108 and @xmath109 mark the contacts of a precipitous drop in the fuv flux which is strong evidence for an accretion - heated spot on the stellar surface .",
    "the ingress interval of @xmath110  s implies a linear distance of @xmath1@xmath111  cm , or a covering factor for a circular spot of @xmath112 .",
    "the amplitude of the drop , @xmath14.4 counts sample@xmath38 , corresponds to a decline in ( dereddened ) flux of @xmath113 ergs @xmath37 s@xmath38 @xmath38 . for @xmath114",
    "pc ( silber et al . 1994 ) , the spot brightness temperature is @xmath115  k.    out of eclipse , the _ hst _ light curves covering @xmath116 show a nearly constant flux level in the nuv and white - light bands , a slow decline in the fuv , and steady rise in line emission .",
    "these features can be explained by a geometry in which the dominant pole is receding toward the stellar limb during the eclipse interval , causing a reduction in fuv flux due to foreshortening , but a rise in the line emission as the roughly radial , optically - thick funnel presents an increasing cross - section to our view .",
    "the implication is that the orientation of the magnetic axis of the white dwarf within the binary is more closely orthogonal to than it is aligned with the stellar line of centers .",
    "the protracted ingress of the accretion stream , which extends nearly to phase zero or some 140  s beyond eclipse of the white dwarf , is a valuable diagnostic of the extent that the accretion stream overshoots in azimuth the white dwarf .",
    "such a path is of course expected for gas traveling in a purely ballistic trajectory ( lubow & shu 1975 ) . the simultaneous and rather abrupt fall to zero light in all bands indicates that the final ingress truly defines an `` edge '' to the gas , as opposed to a gradual thinning out ( cf . the eclipse profiles of v1309  ori  in figures 1 and 6 ) .",
    "the implied extension of the emitting gas above the white dwarf is @xmath117  cm , or @xmath19",

    "variations in the shape of stream egress in the interval @xmath125 can be appreciated by an intercomparison of the curves of steiman - cameron & imamura ( 1999 ) and to the white - curve in figure  3 .",
    "asynchronous am her systems have proven to be interesting puzzles . the prototype , v1500 cyg ( stockman , schmidt , & lamb 1988 ) , was unusually straightforward because it had already accumulated a rich photometric record due to its 1975 nova outburst ( e.g. , patterson 1979 ) and the system accretes continuously onto both magnetic poles . among the subsequent 3 discoveries5840=euvej2115@xmath56586 ]",
    ", it has been more common to find periods that are sidebands and/or harmonics of the underlying @xmath126 and @xmath127 due to pole - switching and migration of the accretion footpoints through the lap period ( see ferrario & wickramasinghe 1999 and mouchet , bonnet - bidaud , & de martino 1999 for recent discussions ) . the bright and highly - polarized by  cam , for example , required study over a period of several years , including an intense photometric campaign , to clearly isolate the spin period of the white dwarf ( silber et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of an eclipsing system among the known asynchronous mcvs is a particular bonus because successive light curves portray an advancing configuration between the stream and stellar magnetosphere .",
    "an extensive observational program could in principle track not only the accretion footpoint(s ) across the white dwarf but also the gas trajectory which gives rise to those variations .",
    "such information would be invaluable in forming a general understanding of the processes which couple the accreting gas to the magnetic field .",
    "v1432  aql  thus occupies a position of unique importance for all mcvs .",
    "because it is eclipsing , the binary period of v1432  aql  is unequivocal at 3.365  hr .",
    "however , controversy immediately arises over the origin of the eclipses , and they have been more commonly labeled `` dips '' to reflect this uncertainty .",
    "watson et al . (",
    "1995 ) noted phase jitter as well as an offset between the optical / x - ray dips and the velocity zero - crossing of the emission lines in proposing that the dips are due to obscuration by a high - density accretion stream .",
    "an extensive photometric campaign by patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) led to the identification of a superposed periodicity at 3.375  hr , taken to be the spin period of the white dwarf and implying a lap period of 50  d. however , the secondary star was preferred as the eclipsing object .",
    "several ensuing studies ( e.g. , friedrich et al .",
    "1996b ; staubert et al . 1995",
    "; geckeler & staubert 1997 ) have supported and extended the duality of periods , but have returned to an eclipse by the stream ( but see geckeler & staubert 1999 ) . recently",
    ", even the period identification was called into question after another variation at @xmath1@xmath128 the orbital period was noted in archival x - ray data ( mukai 1998 ) .",
    "the defining measurement  detection of phase - modulated circular polarization  consists only of unpublished data ( from buckley , quoted by watson 1995 ) which appears to support the period assignment of patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "four epochs of fos spectroscopy were attempted of v1432  aql ; unfortunately the final observation was lost due to an on - board tape recorder failure .",
    "overall , the data span @xmath1@xmath128 of a 50  d lap cycle .",
    "as shown in figure  4 , dip ingress and egress were each recorded on only one occasion .",
    "the light curves vary enormously among themselves and are quite unlike those of the other eclipsing systems .",
    "at all epochs a downward inflection is apparent near @xmath129 , at approximately the phase of optical ingress ( e.g. , watson et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , the duration of this transition varies with epoch and fos waveband from @xmath130 ( 360  s ) for all continuum bands on 19 aug .",
    "1996 to @xmath64 ( 60  s ) for the fuv approximately 2 weeks later .",
    "the dips approach totality only in the fuv , and even here significant signal remains at minimum light for all but the 3 sep . observation .",
    "the phase of optical egress , @xmath66 , is barely covered on 29 aug . , but there is no indication of a sharp inflection in any of the spacecraft bands at this time ; indeed the data are consistent with a smooth rise in count rate from the brief minimum around @xmath131 .",
    "by contrast , the emission - line channel shows no evidence of dips at all , with only a gradual , ill - defined fading through the observation of 19 aug .",
    "the data from this epoch were also searched for spectral shifts in the centroid and shape of @xmath51549 during the `` ingress '' period @xmath132 , such as might occur from the eclipse of a disk .",
    "no such variations were detected to a limit of about one diode ( @xmath1600  km  s@xmath38 ) .",
    "the top panel of figure  12 presents the pipeline - processed spectrum of v1432  aqlaveraged over all epochs .",
    "the plot basically resembles the single _ iue _ spectrum obtained by friedrich et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .",
    "however , two new features are evident in the much higher quality fos data : a prominent 2200    depression , and the presence of ly@xmath133  in absorption .",
    "the interstellar absorption feature can be erased cleanly for a visual extinction @xmath134  mag .",
    "eclipse ( @xmath135 ) and post - eclipse ( @xmath136 ) spectra corrected for this effect are shown in the bottom panel of figure  12 , both taken from the run on 29 aug .",
    "1996 , and line strengths computed from the mean dereddened spectrum are listed in table  3 .",
    "a total extinction of @xmath137  mag is by far the largest found among the objects studied here , but in good agreement with a value of 0.6  mag derived from the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) maps for @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the implied neutral hydrogen column is @xmath140  @xmath37 , and the corresponding equivalent width ( ew ) of damped ly@xmath133  is @xmath125    ( wolfe et al . 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the interstellar medium is an important contributor to the deep absorption feature we detect .",
    "we have added a sequence of panels to the light curves in figure  4 depicting the ew of the ly@xmath133  line . in these plots",
    ", ew @xmath141 corresponds to an absorption line , ew @xmath142 indicates emission , and the measurements have been smoothed with a running - mean of width 40  s ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this index measures the net strength of the feature , since these low resolution data do not resolve the absorption component from any emission line due to the gas stream .",
    "note that the feature shows roughly constant ew except for phase intervals when the fuv flux is near zero ",
    "i.e. @xmath144 during the deep dips of 29 aug . and 3 sep .",
    "the dereddened out - of - eclipse spectrum in figure  12 exhibits a continuum that rises smoothly to the blue , somewhat flatter than rayleigh - jeans .",
    "when compared to blackbodies , a temperature of @xmath145  k is found to reproduce the uv slope and not exceed the dereddened optical continuum of the only published spectrum of v1432  aql  that is provided in absolute units ( patterson et al .",
    "1995 ) . to compute the size of the object with this effective temperature , the distance estimate of @xmath1230  pc ( watson et al . 1995 ) must be reduced by 16% to @xmath1200  pc to account for the implied 0.3  mag of @xmath146-band extinction , where detection of the m4 v secondary was made . for a circular object , the uv - optical source",
    "is then estimated to have a radius @xmath147  cm . if white dwarf model atmospheres are used instead ( bergeron 1994 ) , a somewhat lower temperature , @xmath148  k , and larger size , @xmath149  cm , ensue .",
    "the model atmospheres also predict a ly@xmath133  absorption feature with an ew of 30    or more which would blend with the interstellar component at this resolution .",
    "the similarity of the derived source size to the disk of a white dwarf is very attractive , and at face value suggests a low - mass star ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "however , there is significant latitude in the combined uncertainties of the extinction correction and distance estimate .",
    "moreover , the white dwarf need not supply the entire observed continuum in either the uv or optical ( note the residual flux level in the eclipse spectrum of figure  12 ) .",
    "thus , a smaller stellar size ( larger mass ) is possible . a somewhat smaller size , @xmath151  cm , is also indicated by the 40  s duration of the most abrupt fuv eclipse ingress on 3 sep . 1996 ( figure  4 ) .",
    "the corresponding luminosity for emission by an entire white dwarf with @xmath152  k is @xmath153 , of which @xmath12% is intercepted by the secondary star .",
    "this illumination amounts to at most 50% of the @xmath154 nuclear luminosity of an m4 dwarf ( cf .",
    "v1500 cyg  schmidt & stockman 1995 ) , so the brightness modulation at the orbital period due to reprocessing would be expected to be modest .",
    "indeed , the average light curve of patterson et al . ( 1995 ) shows a @xmath10.5  mag variation away from the dip feature , peaking near @xmath155 , as is appropriate for an origin on the inner hemisphere of the companion ( see the discussion of this point by patterson et al . ) .",
    "a contribution from the white dwarf and illuminated secondary is also consistent with the weak level of optical circular polarization measured for v1432  aql  ( @xmath156% , friedrich et al .",
    "1996b ; watson 1995 ) .",
    "because a hot white dwarf can account for the basic characteristics of the uv - optical spectral energy distribution and is consistent with the mean optical light curve and polarization , we adopt this explanation throughout the remainder of the paper .      with the observed energy distribution from the uv through the optical dominated by the hot white dwarf , we now investigate the origin of the photometric dips .",
    "discussion on this topic has centered around the regularity of the features , their depth in various wavelength regions , the duration of ingress / egress , and their phasing relative to other indicators of orbital motion .",
    "secondary star proponents point out the very predictable dip ephemeris and phasing relative to the emission - line radial velocities ( patterson et al .",
    "gas stream advocates , on the other hand , note an energy dependence of eclipse depth in x - rays and the ingress / egress intervals , which exceed those expected for the sharp - edged eclipse of a white dwarf ( watson et al . 1995 ; friedrich et al . 1996b ; geckeler & staubert 1997 ) .",
    "new information on this question is provided by the fos spectroscopy .",
    "first , the dips in figure  4 are seen to be highly variable in both _",
    "shape _ and _ depth _ from epoch to epoch . note in particular the absence of a defined ingress on 19 aug .",
    ", the lack of an expected egress on 30 aug . , and the variable depth at minimum light .",
    "such behavior is natural for absorption due to a dense , ill - defined gas stream but at odds with a stellar eclipse .",
    "this is particularly true for the fuv channel , which from our prior conclusions is dominated by the hot white dwarf .",
    "indeed , based on our results for uz for ( paper ii ) and the other systems studied here , it is difficult to imagine any source of appreciable light in the @xmath1@xmath157    region that would not be located on or very near the white dwarf .",
    "second , the uv emission lines are essentially _ undiminished _ through the absorption dips . this fact has already been noted for the optical lines by watson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and contested by patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ; see their figures  12 and 13 ) .",
    "the issue revolves around the various line components and their places of origin . in the case of the high - ionization lines of  and ,",
    "the lack of eclipse features in figure  4 is unequivocal .",
    "we also point out that if the white dwarf were being eclipsed by a secondary which fills its roche lobe , the observed duration of the dip ( 820  s or @xmath158 ) requires an inclination @xmath159 . in this case , the eclipse track crosses behind the secondary disk @xmath1@xmath160 of the way from the center .",
    "the remainder of the disk would be expected to obscure line - emitting gas in the lower accretion streams(s ) out to @xmath17  @xmath4 above the orbital plane for a period of up to @xmath1800  s. no such reduction in emission - line light is evident .",
    "we therefore conclude that the absorption dips in v1432  aql  are due to the intervention of a dense portion of the accretion flow . in the context of emission by a white dwarf disk and eclipse by a stream , the curious `` choppy '' appearance to the light curves _ at all orbital phases _ ( watson et al .",
    "1995 ; patterson et al .",
    "1995 ) is suggestive of persistent obscuration by gas clumps , such as might occur in a circulating accretion `` ring '' .",
    "a similar structure is inferred to exist in the asynchronous mcv v1500 cyg from its ever - present sinusoidal polarization curve that implies 2-pole accretion ( schmidt , liebert , & stockman 1995 ) .",
    "we also note that the lack of an identifiable eclipse by the secondary implies that the inclination of v1432  aqlis @xmath161 .",
    "a very rough estimate can also be gained from the observed radial velocity half - amplitude of the narrow emission lines ( 160  km  s@xmath38 ; patterson et al .",
    "1995 ) , which for reasonable white dwarf and secondary star masses ( @xmath10.6 and 0.3  @xmath72 , respectively ) suggests @xmath162 .",
    "the link between the nova event and asynchronism was established with the discovery that the 1975 nova system v1500 cyg is an mcv ( stockman et al .",
    "1988 ) . in support of this position , patterson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) has pointed out the vanishing likelihood that all 4 asynchronous systems would be synchronizing for the first time , given that the spin - orbit period difference is universally @xmath11% and that , when measured , locking timescales are all in the range @xmath163  yr ( schmidt et al . 1995 ; mason et al .",
    "1995 ; geckeler & staubert 1997 ) .",
    "the likely alternative is that most , if not all , of the asynchronous am her systems were previously phase - locked and that the magnetic connections were broken in recent nova events .    only in the case of v1500 cyg",
    "is the post - nova classification certain .",
    "the object has an extremely rich observational history post-1975 , the white dwarf temperature has been measured at @xmath164  k and decreasing , and the object lies at the center of an expanding debris shell . none of the other asynchronous systems have been associated with a nebula , despite searches .",
    "the likelihood that the aforementioned abundance anomalies of by  cam (  3.2 . ) are indicative of mixing with nova - processed material is reduced now that the synchronized systems v1309  ori  and mn  hya  have been found to show elevated line strengths . a nova event in the recent past of the 8  hr - period v1309  ori  appears particularly improbable , as it should be especially easy to disrupt and slow to resynchronize .",
    "excluding v1500 cyg , the temperature of @xmath135,000  k that we have measured for the white dwarf in v1432  aql  is far and away the hottest yet found on an am her system ( sion 1999 ; gnsicke 1999 ) .",
    "when all cvs are considered , white dwarfs this hot have been detected _ only _ in dwarf nova and nova - like classes ( sion 1999 ) , both of which are thought to be eruptive .",
    "it is therefore tempting to classify v1432  aql  as the second post - nova am her system . using the cooling calculations of prialnik ( 1986 ) as a guide , the current stellar luminosity of @xmath165 for v1432  aql  vs. @xmath15  @xmath166 for v1500 cyg ( schmidt et al .",
    "1995 ) suggests that the interval since the last eruption of v1432  aql  is in the range @xmath167  yr . at a distance",
    "@xmath168  pc and an expansion velocity @xmath169  km  s@xmath38 , the shell could now be several arcminutes across . because the surface brightness of a nebular remnant scales as @xmath170 ( cohen 1988 ) , direct imaging of it might be very difficult ( see also wade 1990 ) .",
    "we note that the faintness and lack of a hot blackbody component in the near - uv spectrum of by  cam ( bonnet - bidaud & mouchet 1987 ; shrader et al .",
    "1988 ) suggest that , if it is also a post - nova system , it is considerably older still and thus detection of a shell would be hopeless .",
    "the fly in the ointment for a post - nova explanation of v1432  aql  is the fact that in this case @xmath171 .",
    "the mechanism outlined by stockman et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for decoupling v1500 cyg involved the transfer of a small amount of orbital angular momentum to the bloated white dwarf during the common - envelope phase of the nova . when the photosphere contracted back within the binary and eventually to a normal stellar radius , the two motions could be distinguished observationally , and @xmath172 . to achieve the v1432  aqlconfiguration from an outburst in an initially synchronized binary",
    "requires either decreasing the orbital period of the binary ( such that the secondary spirals inward ) or increasing the spin period of the primary .",
    "shara et al .",
    "( 1986 ) has shown that the net effects of frictional angular momentum loss on a secondary orbiting within the envelope results in a decrease in the binary dimension @xmath173 only for slow novae with very low - mass secondaries ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "of course , for v1432  aql , it is not sufficient merely that @xmath175 , but that the resulting decrease in @xmath127 exceed the decrease in @xmath126 due to spin - up of the envelope ( the v1500 cyg effect ) . thus , an explanation of the sense of asynchronism of v1432  aql  purely in terms of dynamical effects is not likely .",
    "more promising is rotational braking of the white dwarf during the mass - loss phase via the strong magnetic field ( the magnetic propeller effect ) .",
    "this problem has been presented in many ways for single stars as well as members of binary systems .",
    "we choose the convenient formulation of kawaler ( 1988 ) , which can be expressed in terms of the fractional change in rotational angular momentum @xmath176 here , @xmath177 is the total mass lost in the eruption , @xmath178 ( radial ) is the alfvn radius out to which corotation is maintained for a radial magnetic field line distribution , @xmath179 is an index that denotes the departure from a radial field geometry , and we have approximated the moment of inertia of the white dwarf by that of a uniform - density sphere .",
    "a value @xmath180 denotes radial field lines , while @xmath181 is appropriate for a dipole . the expression for @xmath178 provided by kawaler ( 1988 )",
    "can be rewritten using parameters appropriate for a 0.6  @xmath72 white dwarf as @xmath182 with @xmath183 being the surface magnetic field in gauss and @xmath184 in gm  s@xmath38 . assuming @xmath185  g and continuous mass loss totalling @xmath186 over a wind phase of @xmath187  s ( macdonald , fujimoto , & truran 1985 ) , we find a decoupling radius for radial field lines @xmath188 , well inside the orbit of the secondary .",
    "the total angular momentum lost is then @xmath189 , with the two limits signifying dipolar and radial geometries , respectively .",
    "the consistency with the 0.3% period difference currently observed for v1432  aql  is encouraging .",
    "the above derivation is admittedly crude .",
    "it serves , however , to illustrate the possible importance of magnetic braking during the outburst . in view of this result",
    ", it might be better to view v1500 cyg as an example , rather than a template , of a nova eruption in an mcv , and given that the net outcome is the result of a competition between at least two effects with magnitudes of a few percent each , a system @xmath171 might also be expected .",
    "in fact , with @xmath178 being most sensitive to the magnetic field strength and duration of the wind phase ( @xmath190 ) , a very fast nova like v1500 cyg could experience spin - up , while a higher - field , slow nova might be spun down .",
    "time - resolved _ hst _ uv spectroscopy of four eclipsing mcvs has enabled us to identify :    * accretion - heated photospheric spots in v1309  ori  and v2301  oph  with covering factors @xmath0 and @xmath10.008 , and blackbody temperatures @xmath2  k and @xmath190,000  k , respectively . * a cyclotron shock on mn  hya  with @xmath191 . *",

    "the undiminished line emission through eclipse indicates that the eclipse is caused by a dense portion of the accretion stream , not the secondary star .",
    "the very hot white dwarf , combined with the current asynchronous nature and rapid timescale for relocking , suggests that v1432  aql  underwent a nova eruption in the past @xmath1@xmath7  yr . a reversed sense of asynchronism , with the primary star currently spinning up toward synchronism , is not at odds with this history , if the white dwarf rotation can magnetically couple to the ejecta during the dense wind phase of the eruption .",
    "time - tagged uv spectrophotometry is an important tool for understanding the sizes and relative contributions of the accretion stream , hot spot , and white dwarf photospheres in mcvs .",

    "<S> emission from the accretion stream is a prominent component in v1309  ori  and v2301  oph , and the protracted eclipse ingress of uv emission lines in the latter object indicates that the stream penetrates the white dwarf magnetosphere to a height of @xmath19  @xmath4 before it is funneled onto the magnetic poles . </S>",
    "<S> the uv emission - line spectrum of v1309  ori  ( and to a lesser extent , mn  hya ) is unusual among mcvs , with the relative strength of @xmath51240 in v1309  orimatched only by the asynchronous system by  cam . </S>",

    "<S> the eclipse light curves vary enormously from epoch to epoch and as a function of waveband . </S>",
    "<S> the dereddened uv spectrum is extremely bright compared with the optical , and the overall spectral energy distribution coupled with the duration of eclipse ingress indicate that the dominant source of energy is a hot ( @xmath6  k ) white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation also accounts for the modest brightness variation out of eclipse and the weakness of optical circular polarization due to cyclotron emission . </S>",
    "<S> undiminished line emission through eclipse indicates that the eclipse itself is caused by a dense portion of the accretion stream , not the secondary star . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the white dwarf in v1432  aql  greatly exceeds that in any other am her system except the recent nova v1500 cyg . </S>",
    "<S> this , combined with its current asynchronous nature and rapid timescale for relocking , suggests that v1432  aql  underwent a nova eruption in the past @xmath1@xmath7  yr . the reversed sense of asynchronism , with the primary star currently _ spinning up _ toward synchronism , is not necessarily at odds with this scenario , if the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf can couple effectively to the ejecta during the dense wind phase of the eruption . </S>"
