    "understanding the evolution of the chemical abundances within the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is fundamental for the development of a galaxy formation and evolution theory which aims at being complete .",
    "numerical codes of chemical evolution address this issue ; they can be thought of as a particular realization of stellar population synthesis models , constraining the evolution of galaxies from the perspective of their observed chemical abundance patterns . from a pure theoretical point of view , since the spectral and broad - band photometric properties of stars depend on their initial metallicity , it is clear that the galaxy chemical evolution should be understood first , before drawing the galaxy spectro - photometric evolution .",
    "chemical evolution models compute the rate of restitution of a given chemical element @xmath0 , at any time @xmath5 of galaxy evolution , by taking into account all the stars which die at that time .",
    "the latter quantity corresponds to an integral appearing in the differential equations of chemical evolution models , involving the galaxy star formation history ( sfh ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) and the nucleosynthetic stellar yields . on the other hand ,",
    "spectro - photometric models recover the integrated spectrum of a galaxy at any time @xmath5 of its evolution , by taking into account all the stars which are still alive at that time .",
    "this quantity is computed by solving two folded integrals involving the galaxy sfh , the imf and the stellar spectra .",
    "given the fact that the integrals involved in chemical and spectro - photometric models are similar , their extremes are complementary : the integrated light from a galaxy is contributed by all the stars which are alive at that time ; the chemical elements are mainly contributed ( to a first approximation ) by all the stars which are dying at that time .",
    "the difficulty of building up a fast and accurate chemical evolution model  including chemical elements restored with a certain delay time from the star formation event  to couple with other population synthesis models , has represented an obstacle for developing a complete galaxy formation and evolution model for different groups in the past .",
    "examples of works combining a chemical evolution model with the galaxy spectro - photometric evolution can be considered those of @xcite for unresolved galactic stellar systems and @xcite for resolved stellar systems .    in this work",
    ", we present a simple and fast method to solve chemical evolution of galaxies , by assuming an instantaneous recycling approximation ( ira ) are neglected in the differential equations , while they are assumed to be infinite for stars with @xmath6 . ] for chemical elements contributed by massive stars and the delay time distribution ( dtd ) formalism for chemical elements restored by type ia supernovae ( sne ) .",

    "this can be easily incorporated in other stellar population synthesis models to better characterize , in a simple but effective way , the formation and evolution of galaxies from the observed properties of their stellar populations at the present time .",

    "model ] , we present the theoretical framework of our model , namely the main assumptions and the set of differential equations which we solve numerically . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the observed set of data for the mw . in section",

    "analytical models of chemical evolution have been widely used in the past by theorists and observers to predict the metallicity evolution of a stellar system in a simplified but , at the same time , highly predictive fashion .",
    "in fact , although these models have intrinsic shortcomings , they provide a very good approximation for the chemical evolution of elements like oxygen , which are restored on short typical time scales from the star formation event .",
    "incidentally , oxygen is also the dominant chemical species among the metals in the galaxy ism , since it is mainly synthesized by massive stars , with lifetimes @xmath8 , dying as core - collapse sne .    beyond the metallicity evolution ,",
    "analytical models of chemical evolution are also able to retrieve the evolution of the galaxy stellar and gas mass with time ; therefore , they can draw an approximate but complete physical picture for the evolution of the various galaxy mass components .",
    "we remind the reader that the galaxy star formation history simply follows from the gas mass evolution , because of the schmidt - kennicutt law which is assumed in the models .",
    "some analytical models do not take into account the fact that the majority of the chemical elements in the ism usually have more than one nucleosynthesis channel ; to complicate further this scenario , each nucleosynthesis channel is also characterized by a distinctive distribution of typical time scales for the chemical enrichment , which differs from the other .    in this section ,",
    "we describe our method for solving the problem of coupling different nucleosynthesis channels in analytical chemical evolution models ; in particular , we show how the nucleosynthesis from core - collapse sne can be coupled with the one by type ia sne in a simplified but effective theoretical picture .",
    "we think that this method can useful both for observers and theorists who wish to decouple  for example  the evolution of chemical elements like oxygen and iron , which do not trace each other and are usually used as tracers of the galaxy metallicity .",
    "chemical elements like iron , silicon or calcium are also synthesized by type ia sne beyond core - collapse supernovae .",
    "it is therefore fundamental to properly take into account the type ia sn contribution in a theoretical model of chemical evolution .",
    "a useful formalism to compute the type ia sn rate in galaxies was developed by @xcite , by originally introducing the concept of dtd in the theoretical framework ( see also @xcite ) . in this formalism , the type ia sn rate is defined as the convolution of the galaxy star formation rate ( sfr ) with a suitable dtd , as follows .",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are suitable values depending on the adopted scenario for the dtd .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 represents the galaxy sfr , with the units @xmath13 , and the normalization constant @xmath14 is related to the fraction of stars in the binary systems giving rise to type ia sne .",
    "the function @xmath15 physically represents the ( unnormalized ) number of type ia sne , which are expected to explode at the time @xmath16 from a burst of star formation at @xmath17 , per unit mass of the simple stellar population ( ssp ) and per unit time of duration of the burst .",
    "observational evidence suggests an integrated number of type ia sne , which is @xmath18 sn per @xmath19 of stellar mass formed , with a scatter of about @xmath20-@xmath21 around this value @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the normalization constants of the examined dtds are chosen so as to fulfill this criterion ; in particular , the constant @xmath14 is computed by requiring the following constraint : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined as the inner and outer radii , where the integrated number of type ia sne ( the numerator in the left - hand side of equation [ eq : norm_cost ] ) and the galaxy stellar mass formed ( the denominator ) are computed .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the so - called  double degenerate scenario \"  in which type ia sne originate from binary systems of electron degenerate co white dwarfs losing angular momentum via gravitational wave emission  can be modeled by assuming @xmath25 ( see also @xcite ) , which provides almost the same final results for the type ia sn rate in galaxies as the dtd proposed by @xcite and recently assumed by @xcite .    an other widely used dtd often assumed in the literature is the so - called  bimodal dtd \" as determined by @xcite .",
    "it was originally defined with the following functional form : @xmath26 where the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 guarantee that the two terms in the equation equally contribute by @xmath29 per cent ; the parameters determining the prompt gaussian function are @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; finally , the time scale of the tardy declining exponential component is @xmath32 .    in this work",
    ", we also test the scenario in which type ia sne originate from the c - deflagration of an electron - degenerate co white dwarf accreting material from a red giant or main sequence companion ( the so - called  single degenerate scenario \" ) .",
    "we assume for the single degenerate scenario the same prescriptions as given in @xcite .      in this work ,",
    "we assume ira for the chemical elements restored by massive stars and the dtd formalism for the delayed chemical enrichment by type ia sne ; in particular , we solve the following approximate differential equation for the evolution of the surface gas mass density of a generic chemical element @xmath0 within the galaxy ism : @xmath33 where we assume that the infall gas is of primordial chemical composition .",
    "the physical meaning of the various terms in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : diff_equation ] ) can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the first term represents the surface gas mass density of @xmath0 which is removed per unit time and surface from the galaxy ism because of the star formation activity .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is the abundance by mass of the chemical element @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   the second term , @xmath35 , takes into account both the stellar contributions to the enrichment of the newly formed chemical element @xmath0 and the unprocessed quantity of @xmath0 , returned per unit time and surface by dying stars without undergoing any nuclear processing in the stellar interiors . by assuming ira",
    ", one can easily demonstrate that this term can be approximated as follows @xcite : @xmath36 where the quantity @xmath37 represents the so - called  return mass fraction \" , namely the total mass of gas returned into the ism by a ssp , per unit mass of the ssp ( see also @xcite for a more accurate approximation to compute the gas mass returned by multiple stellar populations ) , and @xmath38 is the net yield of @xmath0 per stellar generation @xcite .",
    "the third term in equation ( [ eq : diff_equation ] ) removes the quantity of the chemical element @xmath0 which is expelled out of the galaxy potential well because of galactic winds .",
    "we assume the galactic wind to be always active over the whole galaxy lifetime and its intensity is directly proportional to the galaxy sfr , namely @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the so - called `` mass loading factor '' , a free parameter in the models .",
    "we can also think at the galactic wind as a continuous feedback effect of the sfr , which warms up the galaxy ism through stellar winds and supernova explosions ; as a consequence of this , the gas can move from the cold to the hot phase of the ism and hence it might not be immediately available for further reprocessing by star formation .",
    "4 .   the forth term represents the amount of @xmath0 restored per unit time and surface by type ia sne , where @xmath41 is the average amount of @xmath0 synthesized by each single type ia sn event .",
    "in particular , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the type ia sn rate , as defined in equation ( [ eq : ia_dtd ] ) .    in summary , by specifying all the various terms ,",
    "we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : diff_equation ] ) as follows : @xmath44    we remark on the fact that equation ( [ eq : diff_equation2 ] ) can be numerically solved with classical methods ( e.g. , with the runge - kutta algorithm ) , once the star formation history ( sfh ) of the galaxy has been previously determined , either observationally or theoretically ; in section [ sec : sfh ] , we show how we derive this information . in this work",

    "the differential equation for the evolution of the galaxy surface gas mass density is linear and it can be easily solved with the laplace transform method , for any assumed smooth gas mass assembly history , acting in the equation as a source term . in the second case ,",
    "since the differential equation is nonlinear in the unknown , a numerical technique is adopted to solve the problem of retrieving the galaxy sfh .      in the case of a linear schmidt - kennicutt law",

    "most of the chemical evolution models in the literature customarily assume a decaying exponential infall rate of gas with time .",
    "historically , the first work in the literature suggesting such an infall law is the one by @xcite .",

    "we are aware that our considerations above are heuristic ; in particular , there should be an underlying physical mechanism , common to almost all actively star forming stellar systems , which is not explained by our simple phenomenological recipes for star formation .",
    "a detailed physical theory must be developed , involving  for example  physical quantities in a statistical mechanics framework .",
    "in particular , one should be able to relate the astronomical quantity `` star formation rate '' with much more physical quantities , in order to gain a deeper knowledge about how a small scale phenomenon like the star formation can be regulated by large scale processes , and viceversa .",
    "an interesting attempt to develop a theory for the star formation activity in galaxies can be found in the work by @xcite .    in principle , a possible method to solve equation ( [ eq : original_kennicutt_law ] ) would be to use the green functions . in particular , by assuming a nonlinear schmidt - kennicutt law , equation ( [ eq : original_kennicutt_law ] ) becomes a bernoulli differential equation with a source function , which is given by the infall term , @xmath77 ; the corresponding green function is determined by the response of the system to a dirac delta function in the infall term , which  as aforementioned  represents the source function in equation ( [ eq : original_kennicutt_law ] ) ; hence , from a physical point of view , the green function corresponds to the solution of the so - called `` closed - box model '' , with all the gas being already present in the galaxy since the beginning of its evolution .    the exact solution for @xmath68 with a nonlinear schmidt - kennicutt law",

    "whatever is the assumed prescription for the galaxy sfr , the best agreement with the set of data for @xmath1 $ ] vs. @xmath3 $ ] is achieved by the model with the single degenerate scenario ( blue solid lines ) , while the predicted trend of the @xmath2 $ ] vs. @xmath3 $ ] with the single degenerate scenario is always above the data ; such an offset for silicon is due to the still large uncertainty in the nucleosynthetic stellar yields of this chemical element .    the models with the bimodal dtd of (",
    "* dashed curves in black ) predict a remarkable change in the behavior of the declining trend of the @xmath7 $ ] ratios , which is due to the assumed secondary population of type ia sne , which contributes by @xmath29 per cent to the global distribution of the delay times ; this tardy component bolsters the iron pollution of the ism at later times .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7 $ ] ratios with the bimodal dtd decline with the steepest slope among the assumed dtds because of the too large number of prompt type ia sne ; this result is in agreement with the findings of @xcite ; all these studies agree that the average number of prompt type ia sne can vary from @xmath99 per cent to a maximum of @xmath100 per cent with respect to the integrated number of type ia sne , hence a percentage which should be lower than the @xmath29 per cent assumed by @xcite , although these authors concluded that for their data also a percentage of @xmath101 per cent could be acceptable .",
    "finally , the models with the double degenerate scenario ( dashed - dotted red curves ) predict a steeper declining trend of the @xmath7 $ ] ratios than the single degenerate scenario as first type ia sne explode .",
    "it is worth noting that , if there are separate sequences for thick and thin disc stars , then the double degenerate dtd ( and even the unlikely bimodal dtd ) may provide a better fit to the mw thin disc than the single degenerate dtd , within our simplified model .",
    "in this work , we have presented a new theoretical framework for following the chemical evolution of galaxies , by assuming ira for chemical elements synthesized and restored by massive stars on short typical time - scales and the dtd formalism for the delayed chemical enrichment by type ia sne .",
    "the main assumptions of our model are the galaxy gas mass assembly history , the stellar yields and the initial mass function .",
    "finally , the sfr law represents also an other fundamental phenomenological assumption in the model .",
    "we have derived a very simple and general formula ( equation [ laplace ] ) , relating the laplace transform of the galaxy sfh with the laplace transform of the galaxy gas mass assembly history , provided the galaxy sfr follows a linear schmidt - kennicutt law , namely @xmath102 .",
    "this formula can be used both to derive the galaxy sfh from the assumed gas infall law and to solve the corresponding inverse problem ( i.e. , retrieving the galaxy gas accretion history from the observed sfh ) .",
    "we remark on the fact that the laplace transform method for solving ordinary differential equations can be used when the latter are linear in the unknown .    in this work ,",
    "we have also considered the case of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the evolution of the galaxy surface gas mass density with time , which can be obtained by assuming @xmath103 , with @xmath4 ( nonlinear schmidt - kennicutt law , with same same index @xmath104 as given in @xcite ) . in this case , the equation has been solved numerically ; then , the derived galaxy sfh has been assumed as an input for the chemical evolution model .",
    "we have shown that the differential equation for the evolution of a generic chemical element @xmath0 can be solved with standard numerical methods ( e.g. , the runge - kutta algorithm ) , once the galaxy sfh has been theoretically determined from our assumptions .",
    "we have applied our model to reproduce the @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath2 $ ] vs. @xmath3 $ ] chemical abundance patterns as observed in the solar neighborhood , by exploring the effect of different dtds for type ia sne and different prescriptions for the sfr law .",
    "we have assumed the galaxy disc to assemble by means of a single gas accretion episode , with typical time scale @xmath88 . in any case , our method can be easily extended also for a two - infall model @xcite .",
    "our model with the single degenerate scenario for type ia sne provides a very good agreement with the observed @xmath3$]-@xmath1 $ ] relation in the mw .",
    "since the nucleosynthetic stellar yields of the other @xmath97-elements , like si , ca or mg , still suffer of large uncertainty , the agreement between model and data for these chemical elements is still not good .",
    "we also conclude that , if there are two separate sequences between thin and thick disc data , then our models with the double degenerate scenario ( or even the bimodal dtd ) may provide a better fit to the thin disc data .",
    "we remark on the fact that a linear relation between the sfr and @xmath68 seems not to be the best fit to data , unless the star formation efficiency is defined as the inverse of the typical dynamical time scale of the system .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that our models with a nonlinear schmidt - kennicutt law provide very similar results for the galaxy sfh and chemical abundance patterns as the model with the linear schmidt - kennicutt law .",
    "we are aware that the assumption of a constant yield per stellar generation is a strong approximation , determining the predicted flat trend of the @xmath7 $ ] ratios at low @xmath3 $ ] abundances , at variance with data showing a remarkable scatter .",
    "this scatter can be reproduced only by introducing an element of stochasticity in the model ( for example , in the stellar yields , in the imf or in the sfr ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7 $ ] ratios at very low @xmath3 $ ] abundances show a global trend , which can be reproduced only by relaxing ira , and hence by including stellar lifetimes and variable nucleosynthetic stellar yields of massive stars , as in the detailed numerical codes of chemical evolution . as type ia sne start exploding , the @xmath7 $ ] ratios steeply decrease , in excellent agreement with data .",
    "the theoretical method , as presented in this work , differs from previous works in the literature , which similarly recover the galaxy chemical evolution from the assumed sfh ( see , for example , @xcite ) , because we initially start from the assumption of a galaxy gas mass assembly history .",
    "then , the galaxy sfh has been retrieved either by means of equation ( [ laplace ] ) , which makes use of the laplace transform to simplify the solution of the differential equation for the evolution of the galaxy gas mass , or by means of numerical techniques .",
    "our theoretical framework can be generalized for any choice of the galaxy gas infall law .",
    "our method for solving chemical evolution of galaxies can be easily included in other complementary stellar population synthesis models , by taking into account chemical elements  like iron  which are restored with a time delay from the star formation event . in this way",
    ", one can easily decouple the evolution of iron and oxygen , which contribute to the total metallicity of the galaxy ism with different relative fractions as a function of the galaxy lifetime .",
