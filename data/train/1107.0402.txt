    "however the construction of the confluent @xmath0-hypergeometric @xmath2-modules is not functorial as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this leads us to some difficulties in obtaining the integral representations of their holomorphic solutions ( i.e. the confluent @xmath0-hypergeometric functions ) .",

    "recall that @xmath3 is a finite subset of a lattice @xmath4 and adolphson s confluent @xmath0-hypergeometric system is defined on @xmath5",
