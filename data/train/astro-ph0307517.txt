    "ngc 6240 is a nearby luminous infrared galaxy ( e.g. , wright , joseph & meikle 1984 ; joseph & wright 1984 ) , comprising two merging nuclei ( north and south nuclei : hereafter , n and s nuclei , respectively ) separated by 1.9   ( condon et al . 1982 ; fried & schulz 1983 ; eales et al . 1990 ; thronson et al .",

    "although many excitation mechanisms for the h@xmath0 have been proposed to date [ shock excitation ( rieke et al . 1985 ; depoy et al .",

    "1997 ; ohyama et al .",
    "2000 ; tecza et al .",
    "however , because of its huge h@xmath0 luminosity and exceptionally large h@xmath0/br @xmath3 intensity ratio , the origin of ngc 6240 s h@xmath0 emission has been the subject of considerable debate ; star formation activity is not strong enough to power all the observed h@xmath0 luminosity ( e.g. , rieke et al .",
    "1985 ; draine & woods 1990 ) .",
    "interestingly , most of the h@xmath0 emission comes from the region between the nuclei , although both br @xmath3 and [ fe ii ] ( originating from ob type stars and supernovae in star - forming regions ) are detected from each nucleus ( herbst et al . 1990 ; van der werf et al .",

    "two possible models have been proposed to explain this intense , off - nuclear , shock - excited h@xmath0 emission . in the first",
    ", the emission is caused by shock heating at the interface between the two colliding galaxies ( tecza et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) , while in the second it is due to the interaction between the hot gas associated with the superwind activity of the s nucleus and the tidally - produced molecular gas concentration between the two nuclei ( ohyama al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "recent high - resolution , sensitive co observations of ngc 6240 at radio wavelengths have revealed that a significant fraction of the system s molecular gas is concentrated not at the two nuclei but rather occupies the region between them , forming a massive thick disk with highly turbulent motion ( tacconi et al .",
    "hereafter we refer to the co gas between the nuclei as the off - nuclear molecular gas or molecular gas concentration .",
    "a violent tidal disturbance during the merging process of the two nuclei could be responsible for the formation of such an off - nuclear molecular gas disk , although the creation of such a massive concentration of gas away from the merging nuclei has no theoretical explanation ( e.g. , barnes 2002 and references therein ; see also tecza et al .",
    "the peak of the h@xmath0 emission is located between the s nucleus and the co peak ( ohyama et al . 2000 ; tecza et al . 2000 ) .    the first step in exploring the reason for the source s unusually intense h@xmath0 emission was the analysis of the velocity field and the excitation conditions of the h@xmath0 lines ( ohyama et al .",
    "2000 ; tecza et al . 2000 and",
    "references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we take the second step by conducting a detailed comparison of the morphological and kinematical conditions of h@xmath0 and co lines .",
    "this work is motivated by the fact that h@xmath0 and co are molecular species with different excitation conditions ; comparisons of their emission lines should give us some new insights on the conditions under which high h@xmath0 emitting efficiency ( h@xmath0 flux per molecular gas content ) is likely .",
    "such a comparison has only recently become possible , as a result of the availability of sub - arcsecond , sensitive mapping observations of both co and h@xmath0 .",
    "tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conducted three - dimensional h@xmath0 mapping observations of this galaxy under sub - arcsec seeing conditions , while tacconi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) carried out high - resolution co ( @xmath4 ) mapping observations with a sub - arcsec beam .",
    "both data have been re - sampled to make a direct comparison between the cold and warm molecular gas at the same scale ( tecza et al .",
    "based on these data , we discuss how h@xmath0 emission can be excited efficiently , focusing on the h@xmath0/co intensity ratio as an indicator of the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency .",
    "all data that we analyze in this paper were reproduced from figure 3 of tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , in which grids of both the co ( @xmath4 ) and h@xmath0 velocity profiles were presented .",
    "these profiles were reproduced from the original data of both tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and tacconi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for h@xmath0 and co , respectively .",
    "the velocity resolution of the original h@xmath0 data was 150 km s@xmath5 , while the spatial resolution was 0.8   - 1.0  , the seeing conditions at the time of observation ( tecza et al . 2000 ) . in the co observations ,",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the elliptical gaussian was beam 0.9@xmath6 0.5  , while the velocity resolution was 6.5 km s@xmath5 .",
    "these data were re - sampled onto @xmath7 arcsec@xmath8 sub - regions ( @xmath9 pc@xmath8 ) around the double nuclei over @xmath10 arcsec@xmath8 ( @xmath11 kpc@xmath8 ) regions , and re - sampled at 140 km s@xmath5 velocity resolution ( tecza et al",
    "these data enabled us to compare the co and h@xmath0 velocity profiles directly , with a resolution that was sufficient to separate the two merging nuclei and the surrounding regions .",
    "the velocity profiles were integrated over blue and red velocity regions ( @xmath12 km s@xmath5 and @xmath13 km s@xmath5 for blue and red , respectively , where @xmath14 is the systemic velocity ) in each sub - region to measure the blue and red intensities of co and h@xmath0 [ @xmath15(co ) , @xmath16(co ) , @xmath15(h@xmath0 ) , and @xmath17(h@xmath0 ) ] .",
    "the velocity cut - offs at @xmath18 km s@xmath5 were applied in the integration because it is necessary to measure the intensities in the same velocity range for all sub - regions in order to make a fair comparison of their spatial distribution .",
    "we found that some sub - regions had a weak co intensity at larger velocity offsets from the systemic velocity , so that the intensity could not be accurately measured out to the velocity cut - off .",
    "we eliminated the integrated intensity data of the sub - regions from the following analyses if the normalized intensity of co ( normalized to be unity at the co peak position : see figure 3 of tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and figure 2 of this paper ) was 0.05 ( the typical noise level ) or less at the cut - off velocity .",
    "the cut - off velocity ( @xmath18 km s@xmath5 ) was chosen as a compromise : although a larger cut - off velocity is desirable for studying the properties of the high - velocity gas components , applying a larger ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 km s@xmath5 ) velocity cut - off would discard a larger number of sub - regions due to a lack of useful integrated intensity data . note that since the observed line widths ( @xmath21 km s@xmath5 and @xmath22 km s@xmath5 for co and h@xmath0 at full width at zero intensity , respectively : tacconi et al . 1999 ; tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) are wider than the applied velocity cut - off ( at @xmath18 km s@xmath5 ) , about 19% and 33% of the total co and h@xmath0 fluxes fall outside the velocity range for the integration , and were not counted in the analysis that follows .",
    "single gaussian profile fitting was used to measure the velocities of both lines [ @xmath23(co ) and @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) ] , although some areas show more complicated emission line profiles , such as a double - peaked profile ( tecza et al .",
    "figure 1 shows the total ( blue+red ) integrated intensity and the velocity maps of both co and h@xmath0 [ @xmath15(co)@xmath24(co ) , @xmath25(h@xmath0)@xmath24(h@xmath0 ) , @xmath23(co ) , and @xmath23(h@xmath0 ) ] .",
    "the peaks of both lines are located between the two nuclei and slightly east of the s nucleus ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "map presented by tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and other previous h@xmath0 maps ( e.g. , sugai et al .",
    "1997 ) showed the h@xmath0 peak between the double nuclei , although our figure 1 shows the peak at a slightly different position .",
    "this is an artefact that was probably caused by the re - sampling of the data onto the @xmath27   sub - regions adopted in producing figure 3 of tecza et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and our figure 1 .",
    "a similar artefact is also seen in the map of co. the adopted velocity range for integrating the profiles ( from @xmath28 km s@xmath5 to @xmath29 km s@xmath5 ) may also affect the positions of the co and h@xmath0 peaks in our maps .",
    "] the velocities of both lines change along pa@xmath30 deg , in the sense that they are blueshifted around the s nucleus and are redshifted in both the ne and sw regions .",
    "simple models of the velocity field , such as a rotation or a pure expansion / contraction , have difficulty reproducing these observations .    to compare the properties of co and h@xmath0 emissions , we here introduce a new index , the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency .",
    "the efficiency is defined as the intensity ratio of h@xmath0 and co [ @xmath2(h@xmath0)/@xmath2(co ) ] , and was calculated over the entire velocity range on each sub - region ( figure 2 ) .",
    "note , however , that these ratios are shown only at velocities where the normalized co intensity is larger than 0.05 ( the typical noise level ) to avoid obtaining erroneous ratios in regions or velocities where co is weak .",
    "next , the integrated h@xmath0 emitting efficiencies for blue [ @xmath31 , integrating over the range @xmath28 to @xmath32 km s@xmath5 ] , for red ( @xmath34 , integrating over the range @xmath35 to @xmath36 km s@xmath5 ) , and for blue plus red ( total ) ( @xmath37 , integrating over the range @xmath28 to @xmath36 km s@xmath5 ) were calculated , in order to examine the spatial and velocity distributions of the efficiencies . here",
    "@xmath38 is the velocity range for the integration , i.e. , @xmath39 km s@xmath5 for blue- and red- , and @xmath40 km s@xmath5 for total - integrated h@xmath0 emitting efficiencies .",
    "a velocity cut - off ( at @xmath18 km s@xmath5 ) was applied in integrating the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency , in the same way as for the calculation of the integrated intensities .",
    "also , the integrated h@xmath0 emitting efficiencies in sub - regions where the normalized intensity of co at the cut - off velocity was less than 0.05 were not used in the following analysis .",
    "the blue - to - red ratio of the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency ( @xmath41/@xmath34 ) could then be calculated .",
    "these values ( @xmath37 and @xmath41/@xmath34 ) are mapped together with the velocity difference between co and h@xmath0 [ @xmath42(h@xmath0)@xmath43(co ) ] in figure 3 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates our main results : ( 1 ) the total h@xmath0 emitting efficiency ( @xmath37 ) is smaller around the co peak , and becomes higher with distance from the peak ; ( 2 ) the blue - to - red ratio of the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency ( @xmath41/@xmath34 ) is smaller around the co peak , and becomes larger with distance from the peak ; and ( 3 ) the velocity difference ( @xmath44 ) is smaller around the co peak , while the h@xmath0 emission becomes more blueshifted with respect to co with distance from the peak .",
    "all these trends are seen almost systematically as a function of position , and are evident well over our resolution ( @xmath45 in space and 140 km s@xmath5 in velocity ) .",
    "it seems noteworthy that the peak of h@xmath0 emitting efficiency corresponds neither to the peak position of co nor to that of h@xmath0 .",
    "we searched for correlations between the measured quantities ( @xmath46 and @xmath41/@xmath34 ) ; the results are shown in figures 4 and 5 . in these plots ,",
    "data are marked with different symbols for different groups of sub - regions , which were divided according to their spatial positions around the co intensity peak : the central region with higher h@xmath0 and co intensities between the two nuclei ( nuclear region ) , the region northeast of the central region ( ne region ) , and the southwestern region ( sw region ) .",
    "two other sub - regions , the most southwesterly regions where h@xmath0 intensity increases with distance from the nucleus ( the sw sub - group ) and the most northeasterly regions with double - peaked profiles ( the ne sub - group ) , are grouped separately .",
    "these sub - regions are also indicated in figure 2 .",
    "we found a tight negative correlation between @xmath2(co ) and @xmath37 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "a spearman rank - order test for the correlation between log[@xmath37 ] and log[@xmath2(co ) ] showed that the probability @xmath48 of consistency with the null hypothesis ( i.e. , no correlation between the two quantities ) is less than 0.001 for any sub - grouping ( all the regions , all the regions except the sw sub - group , and all regions except for both sw and ne sub - groups ) .",
    "therefore we consider that we have definitely shown that the total h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is enhanced in the outer regions with weaker co emission .",
    "two other positive correlations were found , between @xmath49 , @xmath41/@xmath34 , and @xmath37 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "although these correlations look less tight , a spearman rank order test showed that the probability @xmath48 of the null hypothesis is 0.20 , 0.02 , and 0.04 for the above three sub - groupings , respectively , in @xmath44 vs. @xmath41/@xmath50 diagram , and 0.02 , 0.001 , and @xmath510.001 for the same three sub - groupings , respectively , in @xmath44 vs. @xmath46 diagram , indicating the presence of significant correlations between these quantities at greater than the 98% significance level if we exclude the sw sub - group .",
    "our analysis has shown that the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and the kinematical conditions of the warm gas are closely related .",
    "such a correlation is a good indication of shock heating , in which bulk kinetic energy is converted to energy radiated through the h@xmath0 line .",
    "although our analyses were carried out only for fluxes within the velocity range of @xmath52 km s@xmath5 , it seems reasonable to interpret the correlation as an indication of the major mechanism of the excitation of h@xmath0 , because this velocity range contains 81% and 67% of the total fluxes of co and h@xmath0 , respectively ( see section 2 above ) . in some inner sub - regions where we can trace the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency at even bluer velocities ( @xmath53 km s@xmath5 )",
    ", we found that the efficiency is generally higher at bluer velocity ( @xmath54 km s@xmath5 ) than at lower velocity ( @xmath55 km s@xmath5 ) , and this fact supports a model in which shock excitation of h@xmath0 is a major excitation mechanism around ngc 6240 .",
    "although other h@xmath0 excitation mechanisms ( e.g. , uv fluorescence , x - ray heating , and formation pumping ) can not be rejected , their contribution to the total must be less important . we note that the same conclusion has previously been reached based on a line - ratio analysis of the near - infrared spectra ( sugai et al . 1997",
    "; tecza et al . 2000 ; and ohyama et al . 2000 ) .",
    "since correlations between the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and the kinematical conditions of the molecular gas were found not only on the sw but also on the ne side of the co peak , on scales of @xmath56 , the molecular gas concentration seems likely to be surrounded by gas that has a simple global motion .",
    "the motion is probably directed predominantly toward the observer , and the interaction between the gas that has this blueshifted motion and the molecular gas concentration would increase the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency on the bluer velocity side of the co emission .",
    "the question then arises : what is the origin of this blueshifted gas motion ? in the following , we discuss two possible explanations .",
    "one possibility is that the merging nuclei are interacting with the off - nuclear molecular gas as they rotate around each other .",
    "although there are no good theoretical explanations for the formation of such an off - nuclear molecular gas concentration in merging galaxies ( e.g. , barnes 2002 and references therein ; see also tecza et al .",
    "2002 ) , here we assume that such concentration has formed as a result of tidal effects during the merging process .",
    "since the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is relatively higher at the sw portion of the concentration , a collision between the s galaxy and the concentration might contribute to the excitation of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the extinction maps ( scoville et al .",
    "2000 ; tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) have revealed the presence of a dusty region at 0 1.0  nne of the s nucleus , and the position of the maximum extinction ( @xmath57 0.2 0.3   nne of the s nucleus ) coincides spatially with the co peak .",
    "this indicates that the s galaxy is behind the dusty molecular gas concentration from our point of view . since the s nucleus is known to be moving toward us around the concentration ( fried & ulrich 1985 ; tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) , a violent collision between the two would enhance the blueshifted h@xmath0 emission at the sw side of the co peak .",
    "if this is the case , however , the redshifted h@xmath0 emission , rather than the blueshifted component , would be enhanced on the opposite side of the co peak , because the n galaxy is rotating away from us on the opposite side of the concentration .",
    "this model therefore can not explain the fact that blue - enhanced h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is observed on both sides of the co peak .",
    "the alternative model is that an outflow associated with the superwind activity of the s nucleus interacts with the off - nuclear molecular gas concentration .",
    "the superwind activity of this galaxy has been recognized as a result of its large - scale ( @xmath58 kpc ) shock - excited filamentary nebulae ( e.g. , armus , heckman , & miley 1990 ; keel et al . 1990 ) and the expanding motion of the h@xmath0 emitting clouds around the nuclear region ( ohyama et al .",
    "2000 ) . since both of the individual galaxies are known to show flat rotation curves in their stellar velocity fields ( tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) , disk structures are likely to be present around each nucleus , even though the system is an advanced merger .",
    "therefore we expect any superwind outflow to exhibit a bi - directional conical shape pointing toward the disk polar direction ( e.g. , tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "1990 ; suchkov et al .",
    "1994 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) , although the shape of the outflow might be distorted due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the medium around the nucleus .",
    "an @xmath59band image of the s nucleus reveals an elongated structure in the nw - se direction , suggesting the presence of a disk whose minor axis is directed ne - sw at an inclination angle of @xmath60 deg ( scoville et al .",
    "2000 ; tecza et al . 2000 ) . also , as mentioned earlier , the s nucleus seems to be located behind the molecular gas concentration . assuming that the off - nuclear molecular gas concentration formed during the merging process of the two nuclei , before the superwind started to blow",
    ", we would expect that , if a bi - conical superwind outflow emanated from the s nucleus , it would interact with the gas concentration from the rear .",
    "this interaction would produce blueshifted h@xmath0 emission around the co peak ( i.e. , not only at the sw but also at the ne sides of the co peak ) if the opening angle of the outflow were wide enough to cover the whole molecular gas concentration .",
    "the oppositely directed cone of the superwind , pointing away from us , would not contribute significantly to the h@xmath0 luminosity , as it would not interact with the off - nuclear molecular gas .",
    "since this model has no major difficulties in reproducing the observations , we regard it as more plausible than the model in which the s nucleus is colliding with the molecular gas concentration . a schematic picture of the superwind model is shown in figure 6 .",
    "note that the real situation would be much more complicated due to the complicated medium distribution around the merging nuclei .    following heckman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , clouds accelerated by the superwind outflow will have a terminal velocity of @xmath61 km s@xmath5 , where @xmath62 is the bolometric luminosity in units of @xmath63 @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the initial distance of the cloud from the nucleus , and @xmath66 is the column density of the interstellar clouds in units of @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "adopting @xmath69 ( sanders & mirabel 1995 ) , @xmath70 kpc ( the projected distance between the s nucleus and the co peak multiplied by a de - projection factor of @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 as a minimum acceptable value corresponding to the typical value for the milky way .",
    "we also adopt @xmath73 as a maximum acceptable value corresponding to one tenth of the total column density inferred from molecular gas observations of @xmath74 ( tacconi et al .",
    ", this equation implies that the clouds would be blown off at a speed of between a few and several hundreds of km s@xmath5 , which is almost comparable to the observed line width of h@xmath0 ( @xmath75 km s@xmath5 in fwhm : e.g. , ohyama et al .",
    "2000 ; tecza et al .",
    "2000 ) and co ( @xmath76 km s@xmath5 in fwhm : tacconi et al .",
    "1999 ) . since the column density is likely to decline outward around the co peak , falling off in a similar way to the co surface brightness , ( figure 1a ) , i.e. , the column density of each cloud is larger near the co peak and is smaller at the outer region , so that clouds in the outer part of the molecular gas concentration would be accelerated up to faster speeds than those near to the co peak .",
    "therefore the observed trend in the relatively blueshifted h@xmath0 emission with respect to the co emission in the outer part of the molecular gas concentration can be explained naturally by the model of superwind - molecular gas concentration interaction .",
    "this fact further suggests that kinematical disturbance due to the superwind also raises the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency within the molecular gas concentration , given the positive correlation between the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and @xmath44 .",
    "it has been pointed out that a c - type shock ( @xmath77 km s@xmath5 ) , rather than a j - type shock with faster shock velocity , is responsible for exciting most of the h@xmath0 emission , although most of the emission comes from clouds within a faster global velocity field ( @xmath78 km s@xmath5 ) ( sugai et al .",
    "one way to resolve this apparent contradiction is to suggest that internal cloud - cloud collisions within the clumpy medium , at speeds of @xmath79@xmath80 km s@xmath5 , excite the h@xmath0 emission , while the clouds move along the global velocity field as a whole ( tecza et al .",
    "since the molecular gas concentration is known to form a turbulent thick rotating disk ( tacconi et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is likely that the concentration is actually composed of numerous smaller clouds ( tecza et al .",
    "a high - resolution velocity dispersion map of the co ( figure 4 of tacconi et al . 1999 ) reveals the presence of regions with higher velocity dispersion just around the co peak ( especially to the se and nw sides of the co peak ) .",
    "therefore it seems very likely that the interaction of small clouds within the molecular gas concentration with the external superwind provides an enhanced random velocity at the outer part of the co concentration , as well as the blueshift of the h@xmath0 with respect to the co.      one of the merits of utilizing cloud - cloud collisions within the molecular gas concentration to give rise to the h@xmath0 emission is that a higher efficiency of energy deposition into the molecular gas clouds from the supernova explosions can be expected as a result of the cloud - crushing mechanism ( cowie , mckee , & ostriker 1981 ) , and the observed huge h@xmath0 luminosity can be explained ( draine & woods 1990 ; elston & maloney 1990 ) .",
    "this therefore raises the question of whether the observed trends in h@xmath0 emitting efficiency , as well as the total h@xmath0 luminosity , can be explained in terms of the cloud - crushing mechanism . in this model",
    ", we may consider , as a simple case , that some fraction of the kinetic energy of the small clouds , randomly moving within the bulk motion of the rotating molecular gas concentration , is dissipated through internal shocks as a result of cloud - cloud collisions , and gives rise to h@xmath0 emission .",
    "then , the h@xmath0 surface brightness at a velocity of @xmath81 can be expressed as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the surface mass density of the molecular gas concentration whose velocity is @xmath81 , @xmath84 is the mass fraction of the small clouds that give rise to h@xmath0 emission through the cloud - crushing mechanism at a velocity @xmath81 , @xmath85 is the mean of the squared internal random velocity of the small clouds , @xmath86 is the fraction of the energy dissipated in the shock which is radiated in the h@xmath0 1 - 0 @xmath87(1 ) line , and @xmath88 is the timescale of the cloud - cloud collisions . since the surface mass density of the clouds @xmath83 is proportional to the observed co surface brightness [ @xmath89 at the velocity of @xmath81 , the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency can be expressed as @xmath90 , by definition .",
    "since we are considering a situation in which the cloud - crushing mechanism is responsible for _ all _ the h@xmath0 emission , we may substitute a constant @xmath86 ( @xmath91 ) and a constant internal velocity ( @xmath92 km s@xmath5 ) into the equation , representing an extreme case of the cloud - crushing mechanism working at its maximum efficiency ( draine & woods 1990 ) .",
    "then , the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency can be expressed as @xmath93 .",
    "this expression indicates that the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is higher when ( 1 ) a larger mass fraction of the clouds is involved in the production of h@xmath0 emission through the cloud - crushing mechanism , and/or ( 2 ) the collision frequency is higher ( i.e. , the collision timescale is shorter ) . the observed close relationship between the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and the kinematical conditions in the molecular gas clouds",
    "can be explained by this expression , if the cloud - crushing mechanism is efficient : the outer part of the off - nuclear molecular - gas concentration is likely to be more strongly influenced kinematically by the interaction with the external superwind ( see section 3.2 above ) , and the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is expected to be higher , since a larger mass fraction of the clouds will produce h@xmath0 as a result of internal cloud - cloud shocks and a higher frequency of the cloud - cloud collisions . in addition , the efficiency is expected to be higher at bluer velocities , because these are likely to be caused as a result of a more violent kinematical influence from the superwind .",
    "therefore , the cloud - crushing mechanism within a molecular gas concentration disturbed by the interaction with the external superwind outflow seems to be able to reproduce the observed trends of the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency in both space and velocity , as well as the higher - than - normal h@xmath0 luminosity . although the mechanism by which the off - nuclear molecular gas concentration between the two merging nuclei is created is not clear , the presence of such a gas concentration is necessary if the model is to reproduce the observed intense and efficient h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we look forward to future theoretical studies of the origin of such a gas concentration ."

    "<S> the gas components are known to be distributed between the two merging nuclei , forming an off - nuclear molecular gas concentration . by comparing three - dimensional emission - line data ( in space and velocity ) of co ( j=@xmath1 ) in the radio and h@xmath0 in the near infrared , we are able to search for the spatial and kinematical conditions under which efficient h@xmath0 emission is produced in much more detail than has previously been possible . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency , defined in terms of the intensity ratio of h@xmath0 to co [ @xmath2(h@xmath0)/@xmath2(co ) ] , as a function of velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we derive this by utilizing the recent high - resolution three - dimensional data presented by tecza et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated h@xmath0 emitting efficiency is calculated by integrating the velocity profile of h@xmath0 emitting efficiency in blue , red , and total ( blue + red ) velocity regions of the profile . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ( 1 ) both the total h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and the blue - to - red ratio of the efficiency are larger in regions surrounding the co and h@xmath0 intensity peaks , and ( 2 ) the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency and the kinematical conditions in the warm molecular gas are closely related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we compare two possible models that might explain these characteristics : a large - scale collision between the molecular gas concentration and the merging nuclei , and a collision between the molecular gas concentration and the external superwind outflow from the southern nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the latter model seems more plausible , since it can reproduce the enhanced emitting efficiency of blueshifted h@xmath0 around the molecular gas concentration , if we assume that the superwind blows from the southern nucleus toward us , hitting the entire gas concentration from behind . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> internal cloud - cloud collisions within the molecular gas concentration are enhanced by the interaction with the superwind outflow , and efficient and intense shock - excited h@xmath0 emission is expected as a result of the cloud - crushing mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the observed spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency can be explained if there is a greater kinematical disturbance in the outer part of the molecular gas concentration , as a result of the interaction with the superwind outflow , and also more frequent cloud - cloud collisions in the region . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the kinematical influence of the superwind on the molecular gas concentration should be larger at bluer velocities , and the collision frequency is expected to be larger at bluer velocities , explaining the relationship between velocity and the h@xmath0 emitting efficiency . </S>"
