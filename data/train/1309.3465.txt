    "coherent transfer between an arbitrary state of a qubit and a superposition of two quasi - classical coherent states is of fundamental conceptual interest in many fields of physics jawheeler83,ccgerry05,stakagi02,manielsen01,ceajarvis09 .",
    "coherent states provide a close connection between classical and quantum mechanics , which has been introduced in a physical context , first as quasi - classical states in quantum mechanics , then as the backbone of quantum optics j - pgazeau09 .",
    "the non - classical nature of such states appears since two coherent states correspond to two different values of a macroscopic variable , such as the quasi - probability distribution in phase space .",
    "recently , in a new branch of quantum computing , two phase - opposite coherent states are exploited to be the macroscopical qubitspcochrane99,hjeong02,tcralph03,tcralph08 .",
    "much attention has been paid on obtaining such superposed coherent states aourjoumtsev07,jsneergaard - nielsen06,htakahashi08,tgerrits11 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a type of modified coherent states based on the canonical coherent state , which also demonstrate the non - classical nature .",
    "we show that an arbitrary atom state can be mapped onto the field as a schrdinger cat state in a resonant jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model .",
    "the reversal process can also be achieved in the aid of spin - echo - like technique .",
    "it is shown that a class of field states can be used as an initial state to perform this task .",
    "numerical simulation shows that the scheme is efficient and can be extended to the entanglement transfer from atoms to distant cavities .",
    "this make it possible to realize entangled pairs of macroscopic objects , nonlocal schrdinger cat state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 ,",
