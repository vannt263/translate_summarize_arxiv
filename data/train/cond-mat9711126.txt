    "one of the leading methods for growing semiconductor quantum dots is via the controlled coarsening of a film of a material that is strained with respect to the substrate on which it is grown.@xcite this ( `` self - assembled '' ) coarsening / roughening is a result of lattice - mismatch - induced strains .",
    "the dots are often capped by the substrate material , thus extending the strain around the dot to all angular directions .",
    "not surprisingly , the interpretation of the electronic structure of such dots is profoundly affected by their strain profile .",
    "thus , in order to calculate or interpret the measured electronic structure , one has first to calculate or measure the position dependent strain tensor @xmath2 .",

    "et al._@xcite    _ ( ii ) atomistic elasticity _ : here , one avoids a continuum description and describes the strain _ energy _ in terms of few - body potentials between actual atoms @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a two - body term , @xmath23 is a three - body function of the bond angle , @xmath24 .",

    "atomic symmetry is retained and harmonicity is not assumed .",
    "this approach has been used for _ small _ ( @xmath31 atom ) wires and clusters  @xcite but it impractical for @xmath32 dots ( @xmath33 atoms ) .",
    "the three approaches to the calculation of strain  harmonic continuum elasticity , ( anharmonic ) atomistic elasticity , and the atomistic quantum mechanical approached  have been recently compared for inas / gaas strained superlattices.@xcite however , no comparison exists for 0-dimensional quantum dots .",

    "we find that : ( i ) the strain profiles obtained via continuum elasticity are in qualitative agreements with those found by atomistic elasticity ; ( ii ) the atomistic elasticity produces different strains on the two facets ( @xmath27 or @xmath35 ) of the zincblend pyramidal dots ( see fig .  1 ) , corresponding to the physical c@xmath36 symmetry , while the continuum elasticity approximates this as c@xmath37 symmetric strain .",
    "( iii ) the quantitative discrepancy resides mostly inside the dots , while the difference in the barrier region is smaller ; these differences are traced back to the fact that the strain lies outside the domain of validity for the linear elasticity .",
    "we illustrate this point by contrasting the predicted @xmath38 ratio of coherent 2d films , as obtained by harmonic continuum elasticity [ eq .",

    "differences are noticeable already for 1 % biaxial strain , whereas the controlled - coarsening ( `` self - assembled '' ) growth method for quantum dots needs to deal with larger mismatches ( 7 % for inas / gaas and inp / gap ) .",
    "finally , the consequences on the electronic structure of the different strain profiles obtained for dots using ce and ae are illustrated .",

    "a piece of island material with no external forces acting on it will have its energy minimum shifted to @xmath44 this fictitious strain corresponds to unstrained island material and must be subtracted .",
    "the corrected strain is still computed with derivatives in the barrier s coordinates and must be converted to the the island coordinates through multiplication by @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the physical strain is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the strain computed directly from the displacement @xmath48 which minimizes @xmath3 .",
    "a numerical solution requires some kind of discretization .",
    "we define the displacements @xmath48 on a cubic grid , thereby maintaining the cubic symmetry of the crystal .",

    "for example , a displacement @xmath54 has @xmath55 when constructed using symmetric differences .",
    "the oscillatory solutions can not be simply discarded since they mix with the physical ones .",
    "non - symmetric derivatives are also problematic since a particular choice will single out a direction in space .",
    "the solution is to average @xmath3 over all permutation of @xmath56 on each of the three difference operators .",
    "that is , we take @xmath57 .",
    "physically this corresponds to taking the energy density at each site to be the average of the energy densities from each adjoining octant .",
