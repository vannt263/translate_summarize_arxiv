    "after a quarter of a century of modest progress , a breakthrough in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) research came in 1997 , when @xmath0-ray and optical afterglow emission was first detected from grb  970228 @xcite , showing a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "this confirmed the cosmological origin of grbs and to date , cosmological redshifts have been obtained for about 50 afterglowsjcg / grbgen.html for the most recent list . ] .",
    "initially , afterglow light curves were often sparsely sampled and had a natural explanation in the standard fireball model ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "many showed a smooth power - law decay followed by a steepening one to two days after the burst .",
    "this temporal behavior has been interpreted as being due to a relativistically expanding collimated outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter r99 ) or more recently to a structured jet viewed off axis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the standard fireball model assumes a single energy release event with subsequent interaction with an ambient medium with constant density or a stellar wind density profile .",
    "it was also generally assumed that the electron energy distribution index , @xmath2 , was independent of time and had values between 2 - 3 , based on theoretical arguments and energy considerations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is quite remarkable that the light curves of most observed afterglows where sufficiently detailed data coverage exists , can be explained within the standard fireball model or slight improvements thereof ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this most likely reflects the underlying universality of the afterglow generation mechanism .",
    "for some bursts , however , interpretations with the unmodified standard model , have proved difficult due to bumps in the light curves or because some basic model parameters turn out to have values outside the range assumed in the model . in particular ,",
    "the slope of the power law energy distribution of the radiating electrons , @xmath2 , is found to be less than 2 in some cases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite have explored the light curves and spectral signatures in models with @xmath3 .",
    "numerical calculations of relativistic shock acceleration suggest a universal value of @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "other work suggests an even higher value of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this has been referred to as the @xmath2-problem @xcite .",
    "recent afterglow observations do indicate , however , that the value of @xmath2 may not be universal @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-problem arises when the standard model is being used to interpret light curves that decay much slower than suggested by the model .",
    "such a slow decay had in fact been anticipated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rm98 and sm00 , respectively ) by the natural assumption that the mass ejected in each event ( and the associated energy ) is released with a range of lorentz - factors rather than a single value .",
    "the distributed energy injection into the fireball sustains higher fluxes for longer periods of time , thus resulting in slowly decaying light curves , without requiring @xmath3 .",
    "the cause of the slow decay is thus shifted from the electron population to the properties of the source itself .",
    "this extension of the standard model was , however , not used to interpret actual data until later ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as continuous energy injection can sustain slower light curve decay rates with @xmath6 , it is important to explore fully the properties and light curve signatures of such models .",
    "in addition to the above quoted references , energy injection in the context of grbs has previously been considered by e.g.  @xcite who give an example of how the afterglow of grb  970508 may be explained by refreshed shocks , although a spherically symmetric model may also work .",
    "@xcite explore the self - similarity of spherical blast waves with continuous energy injection , while @xcite consider a model in which a pulsar is assumed to provide the additional energy , a variant of which was also considered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite explore a toy model of the interaction of two colliding shells and estimate the flux contribution from both the forward and the reverse shocks .",
    "then , @xcite consider the interaction of two colliding shells in detail and determine a criteria for such collisions to be mild or violent .",
    "@xcite considers additional energy injection in interpreting observations of several grbs .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite conclude that discrete energy injections are needed to properly account for the optical afterglow of grb  030329 .",
    "all adopt different degrees of approximations on various model ingredients .    in recent months , observations by the _ swift _ satellite",
    "have shown that the early light curve behavior may not be as smooth as previously thought .",
    "the origin of these variations may be due to the transition from the prompt phase to the afterglow phase or due to a strong initial reverse shock @xcite .",
    "the slower decaying portions of the light curves may be due to continuous energy injection @xcite .",
    "in particular , grb  050319 @xcite and grb  050315 , have shown this kind of a behavior ( see * ? ? ? * for the latter burst and further examples ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed analysis of relativistic fireballs with either discrete or continuous energy injection .",
    "we show that this has interesting observational consequences in addition to the slower decay and provides clear signatures in the light curves .",
    "an example of these effects has already been presented by @xcite , where a discussion of the polarization properties can also be found .",
    "the clearest of those signatures are bumps in the light curves due to refreshed shocks , which may in fact have been observed in e.g.  grb  021004 and grb  030329 .",
    "these signatures provide additional information on the hydrodynamic properties of the fireball .",
    "we give examples of fits to three grb afterglows and show that even with the additional energy injection , there remains some discrepancy between the model and the data , especially at radio wavelengths . in our approach",
    "we try to keep the treatment as self - consistent as possible and improve on several of the approximations of some of the previous work .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : dynamics ] we review the effects that energy injections have on the dynamics of the fireball and outline our approach to the problem . in section",
    "[ sec : approx ] we present approximations for simple modeling of the dynamical evolution . in section [ sec : lcurves ] we discuss the ingredients in the radiative component of our model and in section [ sec : interp ] we give examples of bursts that may be interpreted with this modified model .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we discuss our results and conclude the paper .",
    "we begin this section by considering energy and momentum conservation .",
    "we follow the approach of rm98 and sm00 and assume that energy is released over a period that is short compared to the duration of the afterglow .",
    "we then specialize the method to three cases : an instantaneous energy injection in section  [ subsec : single ] for easy comparison with r99 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , several discrete injection events in section  [ subsec : discrete ] , and finally continuous injection with a power law distribution of the lorentz factors in section  [ subsec : continuous ] .",
    "we assume the dynamical evolution to be adiabatic in all cases .",
    "assume that the total ejected mass with initial lorentz factor higher than @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass ejected with the highest lorentz factor @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a function specifying the distribution of ejected mass with lorentz factor @xmath7 .",
    "we prefer to use @xmath13 as a variable , and introduce a dimensionless function @xmath14 , defined by @xmath15 , in the interval @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the minimum lorentz factor occurring in the ejected mass .",
    "we then have @xmath18 .",
    "note that in general @xmath19 , since in realistic scenarios we must have @xmath20 .",
    "note also that @xmath21 . the original fireball scenario with an instantaneous energy release is equivalent to @xmath22 .",
    "the energy of a mass element @xmath23 is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the velocity of light , and the total energy of the ejecta with lorentz factor greater than @xmath7 is therefore given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "integrating by parts we find that @xmath28 the expanding shell decelerates by sweeping up the ambient medium . assuming that the instantaneous total mass of the swept up medium is @xmath29 , the total energy of the shell can be expressed as @xmath30c^2)$ ] , where @xmath31 is the average internal lorentz factor of the particles in the expanding shell . ) below . ] using this and equation  ( [ eq : eintegral ] ) above , we find that the conservation of energy may be written as @xmath32+f , \\label{eq : econs}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 and @xmath34 note that the swept up mass ratio , @xmath35 , increases as @xmath7 decreases .    in the preceding equations we have assumed that the slower moving mass shells ejected by the central engine catch up with the decelerating shock front as soon as the lorentz factors of the two coincide .",
    "this is a simplification , as the speed difference between the ejected mass elements will cause a time delay .",
    "the dynamical evolution is however not affected by this , but it should be kept in mind when considering reverse shocks originating from shells colliding with the shock front . a method for including this time delay will be discussed in section [ subsec : discrete ] .    before impact with the expanding shock front",
    ", each mass element has momentum @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the velocity of the mass element in the burster frame .",

    "a description of the swept up mass , @xmath35 , is also required ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : dfdr ] ] below ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) is the key equation for obtaining the dynamical evolution of the fireball and has to be solved numerically in all realistic cases .",
    "since we take the evolution to be adiabatic , the dynamics can be solved for separately and the radiative properties computed afterwards .    for a complete description of the fireball evolution",
    "we must solve four differential equations ( r99 ) @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the radial coordinate in the burster frame and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the burster frame time , the comoving frame time and the observer frame time , respectively .",
    "the solid angle into which the energy is beamed is estimated by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the initial opening angle of the collimated outflow and @xmath52 is the sound speed in the comoving frame , assumed to be relativistic .",
    "the mass density of the external medium is @xmath53 , which in general is a function of radius .      in the standard fireball scenario",
    "it is assumed that the energy is released instantaneously with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we then find that @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) reduces to @xmath58 ^ 2-[\\gamma_0 ^ 2 - 1]}}= \\frac{\\gamma_0+f}{\\sqrt{1 + 2\\gamma_0f+f^2 } } , \\label{eq : e_inst}\\ ] ] which agrees with the result of @xcite and is the starting point of the r99 analysis ( see his eq .  [ 4 ] ) .",
    "some authors have based their analysis of grb afterglows on this equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "grb  990510 is an example of a burst where the afterglow may be readily interpreted with a single instantaneous energy release event .",
    "we present our fit to the observations in section  [ sec:510 ] .",
    "assume that in addition to the initial injection @xmath9 , the central engine expels several shells with masses @xmath59 and lorentz factors @xmath60 .",
    "converting to dimensionless variables , @xmath61 and @xmath62 we have that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we then obtain , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that by the assumptions of our approach discussed in the first two paragraphs of section  [ sec : dynamics ] , the @xmath67 s form a decreasing sequence .",
    "inserting equation  [ eq : fdiscrete ] into equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) we obtain @xmath68 ^ 2          - \\left [ \\gamma_0\\beta_0 + \\sum m_i \\sqrt{\\gamma_0 ^ 2x_i^2 - 1 } h(x_i - x )          \\right]^2}}.\\ ] ] because the heaviside function is zero until @xmath69 , it is clear from this equation that the dynamical evolution between injections is similar to the instantaneous case as the evolution of @xmath7 depends only on @xmath35 in the same way .",
    "when a shell collides with the shock front , a reverse shock may propagate back through the shell if the collision is violent @xcite .",
    "depending on the circumstances , radiation from the reverse shock may make a substantial contribution to the afterglow light @xcite . according to @xcite , the liklihood of getting a reverse shock depends on the relative energy and speed between the shells and the width of the incoming shell .",
    "as the energy is known and we neglect the dynamics in the shell collision , only the relative speed is needed .",
    "assuming that only the shock front slows down due to interaction with the surrounding medium and that the trailing shell travels with constant speed , shells ejected with the average lorentz factor of the shock , @xmath70 , will have reached the shock front at @xmath46 in time @xmath49 . replacing @xmath71 with @xmath72 in equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] )",
    "is then sufficient to account for the delay .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the lorentz factor of the incoming shell is @xmath73 in a constant density environment for most of the evolution .",
    "combined with the results from @xcite ( see their figure 3 ) this indicates that for a reverse shock to result , the energy of the incoming shell must be at least twice the energy of the shock front .",
    "we emphasize that in our numerical calculations we assume the shell collisions to be instantaneous and we neglect the effects of the interaction on the light curves .",
    "these effects are expected to be small considering that the relative lorentz factor of the collision is @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the shells would have to be at least several hundred light seconds thick for the effects of the interaction to be measurable with current instruments ; these would also be strongly smoothed because of the equal arrival time surface ( eats ) .",
    "an example of an afterglow that may be interpreted with discrete energy injections is that of grb  021004 .",
    "@xcite showed that its properties , including polarization , could be explained by using such a model .",
    "energy injection does affect the polarization levels calculated using the model of @xcite as these are most strongly determined by the lorentz factor .",
    "changes in the lorentz factor therefore manifests itself not only in the light curve but also in polarization data .",
    "an analysis of a more detailed data sets for grb  021004 has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the late time afterglow and the host galaxy of this burst have been studied by @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of grb  030329 also showed variations both in the optical and the polarization light curves .",
    "these have previously been interpreted with energy injections @xcite , although other alternatives have also been explored @xcite .",
    "an application of our approach to that particular burst will be presented elsewhere ( guizy et al .  in preparation ) .      here , we follow the approach of rm98 and sm00 and assume that @xmath75 , with @xmath76 , i.e.  the energy is dominated by the lowest lorentz factors .",
    "( the case @xmath77 is equivalent to instantaneous injection as the energy is then dominated by the highest lorentz factors ) .",
    "then @xmath78 , where @xmath79 to evaluate @xmath80 , we assume that @xmath81 , which is always a good approximation if @xmath82 .",
    "we then find @xmath83 .",
    "the dynamical equation for @xmath7  ( eq .  [ [ eq : gamma ] ] ) in this case becomes @xmath84 note that for @xmath85 , we recover the result for the instantaneous case ( eq .  [ [ eq : e_inst ] ] ) .",
    "also note that the second term under the square root is @xmath86 when @xmath87 .",
    "when considering models with continuous injection , we numerically solve equation  ( [ eq : gamma_con ] ) , since in all relevant cases @xmath88 .",
    "the quantities that determine the dynamical evolution of the fireball are the dimensionless mass ratios @xmath14 and @xmath35 , representing the injected energy and the swept up mass , respectively ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : gamma ] ] ) .",
    "@xmath14 is an input quantity in the model , and hence each case has to be solved separately . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath35 is only dependent on the evolution of @xmath46 , @xmath53 and @xmath89 .",
    "in general , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 for constant density interstellar medium ( ism ) and @xmath92 for a wind like environment . the evolution of @xmath35 can easily be obtained in two cases : the _ confined outflow _",
    "case when @xmath93 and @xmath89 may be considered to be a constant . in this case the dynamics is that of a spherical outflow .",
    "the second case is that of a _ laterally spreading outflow _",
    ", when @xmath94 and @xmath89 is large enough to neglect the initial opening angle .",
    "these cases were referred to as the power law regime and the exponential regime , respectively , in r99 . that naming convention is however too limiting as we show below",
    ", since for a continuous energy injection there is no exponential regime .    as a prescription for @xmath35 in the confined case ,",
    "we evaluate it as @xmath95 while in the laterally spreading case we adopt ( see r99 ) @xmath96 to obtain a full solution of the problem and the light curve behavior , these need to be consistently included in the calculation .",
    "approximate solutions applicable in the instantaneous case have been discussed in detail by e.g.  r99 and @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the approximations can give useful insight into the properties of the fireball but they should , however , only be expected to be valid during limited time intervals in the afterglow evolution .",
    "this is partly due to the validity of the underlying assumptions in those limited intervals , and partly due to the influence of the eats on the evolution ( see section  [ sec : eats ] ) .",
    "another factor is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , that is not really a set of broken power laws ( see appendix  [ sec : app ] ) , but has an intrinsic curvature , and so do the lightcurves . in the following",
    "we first give a brief discussion of the discrete case but then concentrate on the case of continuous energy injection .      if the energy is released in several discrete events ( as discussed in section  [ subsec : discrete ] ) , the evolution after a shell impact can be approximated with the evolution following a single release event with the appropriate initial parameters .",
    "of these , only the energy is relevant , being equal to the total energy that has accumulated in the shock front after the impact .",
    "integration over the eats then smooths out the transition .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ subsec : discrete ] , the relative speed between the impacting shell and the decelerating shock front is an important factor in evaluating the reverse shock emission arising from the collision .",
    "the speed of the incoming shell equals the average speed of the shock front at the time of collision , and to estimate it , we need to know how the radius of the fireball , @xmath46 , evolves with time in the burster frame , @xmath47 . using @xmath97 , appropriate for a single release ( see r99 ) , and equations  ( [ eq : ffix ] ) and  ( [ eq : dfdr ] ) , it is easy to show that in the confined case the speed of the incoming shell is @xmath98 . although this should only be valid early on in the evolution , numerical calculations indicate that it is in fact appropriate during most of the evolution .",
    "all results derived in this section assume that the shock speed , @xmath99 .",
    "we first note that as @xmath35 is the swept up mass in units of the initial ejected mass , it is small compared to the other terms in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_con ] ) for a substantial fraction of the initial fireball evolution , but will dominate at later times .    early in the evolution of the fireball , when @xmath71 is close to 1 , @xmath100 and we recover equation  ( 4 ) in r99 , and an identical initial fireball evolution .",
    "the most interesting case , however , is when @xmath101 . from the definition of @xmath102",
    "we see that this occurs when @xmath103 , i.e.  when @xmath104 for @xmath105 and for @xmath106 , when @xmath107 . in this case equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] )",
    "simplifies to @xmath108 when both @xmath10 and @xmath35 can be neglected compared to @xmath102 , we have that @xmath109 . dividing by @xmath10 and solving for @xmath13 , we find @xmath110 note that in the limit , @xmath111 , we recover the power law behavior of the instantaneous injection case , where @xmath112 ( r99 ) .    _ confined outflow : _ here",
    ", we adopt equation  ( [ eq : ffix ] ) , with @xmath113 , as the solid angle into which the beam propagates . inserting into equation  ( [ eq : x ] )",
    ", we find that @xmath114 as in r99 , we also evaluate the relevant times . from @xmath115 ,",
    "we find by integration that the time in the comoving frame is @xmath116 similarly , from @xmath117 , the time in the observer frame is given by @xmath118 inverting this result and inserting into equation  ( [ eq : xx ] ) , we find that @xmath119 , in agreement with the sm00 result . also note that if we set @xmath120 and @xmath91 , we recover the results of r99 .    _ laterally spreading outflow : _ the treatment is similar to that of r99 .",
    "the @xmath92 case can not , however , be solved analytically due to the coupling of the variables .",
    "we therefore only consider the case @xmath91 in this section ( constant density ism ) .",
    "the general case has to be solved numerically .",
    "we start from equation  ( [ eq : dfdrexp ] ) , divide by @xmath121 and integrate to obtain @xmath122 in agreement with equation  ( 14 ) of r99 if we set @xmath120 . here , @xmath123 is a constant of integration to be determined by the initial conditions .",
    "it becomes negligible when @xmath124 .",
    "the exponential behavior discussed by r99 is seen to follow from equation  ( [ eq : fs ] ) .",
    "if @xmath120 ( formally equivalent to the instantaneous case ) , then equation  ( [ eq : fs ] ) shows that @xmath125 so that @xmath126 , and the time in the comoving frame increases exponentially with @xmath46 .",
    "therefore @xmath35 also increases exponentially with @xmath46 .    on the other hand , if @xmath76 , the behavior becomes a pure power - law , @xmath127 and @xmath128 which shows that the exponential regime is a special case .",
    "it follows that @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the physical reason for this change in behavior is that the dynamical evolution is now determined by the power - law energy injection rather than the lateral spreading .",
    "we note that in general , if the incoming shell has the same opening angle as the initial @xmath51 , the resulting decay will be a mixture of a power - law decay for the part of the outflow within @xmath51 , and an exponential for that part of the flow that is outside of @xmath51 .    by assumption ,",
    "the dynamical evolution is independent of the radiative properties of the fireball . to proceed , a prescription of the radiative processes is required .",
    "we adopt the standard synchrotron emission mechanism ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) , that is widely assumed to be the source of radiation in grbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details of the radiative component of our modeling are given in section  [ sec : lcurves ] and in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "to explore the approximate light curve behavior , @xmath132 , we need to evaluate the characteristic frequencies @xmath133 , @xmath134 and the flux @xmath135 at the former ( see appendix  [ sec : app ] for definitions of these quantities ) .    for the confined case , the temporal behavior of the characteristic frequencies , the @xmath135 , and the light curve decay indices , @xmath136 , agree with those previously derived for the forward shock by sm00 ( see table 1 in their paper ) .    for the laterally spreading case we find on the other hand @xmath137    .exponents for @xmath132 for a laterally expanding beam . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fitpar ]    grb  990510 was the first burst where a polarized afterglow was detected @xcite .",
    "however , as there was only one positive detection it does not constrain the model very much , although it further strengthens the case for a synchrotron origin of the afterglow emission .",
    "this polarization measurement is easily accounted for by an off - axis viewing angle .",
    "it was not included in the fit presented here .",
    "the afterglow of grb  000301c is well time resolved at optical and radio wavelengths and was observed in the near infrared and at mm wavelengths although no @xmath0-ray observations have been published .",
    "a short lived brightening was observed in the optical light curves at about 3.5 days followed by a steep achromatic break around 7 days after the burst @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this bump may be caused by micro - lensing @xcite .",
    "their @xmath138 value of the fit is reduced by half by introducing the lens effect .    here",
    ", we fit the afterglow light curves with our model containing one additional energy injection , @xmath139 at @xmath140 days post - burst .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig:000301c ] , where a host contribution of @xmath141 @xmath142jy at 8.5  ghz has been subtracted from the data .",
    "the data in the figure is corrected for galactic extinction of @xmath143 @xcite , and an intrinsic smc like extinction of @xmath144 using the profile of @xcite .",
    "this value for the intrinsic extinction was found by @xcite which fitted a power law spectrum with various extinction curves to the measured seds .",
    "fitting the data with a model with just an initial instantaneous energy release results in @xmath145 ( dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:000301c ] ) . adding the energy injection @xmath139 ,",
    "reduces this by a a factor of three to @xmath146 , and gives the parameters presented in table  [ tab : fitpar ] .",
    "most of the reduction in the @xmath147 is due to the optical light curves , as the energy injection allows for a fairly constant emission at 8.5 ghz and the sharp steepening of the optical light curves at approximately 6 - 7 days ( solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:000301c ] ) .",
    "the remaining contribution to the @xmath147 is due to the bump at 3.5 days in the optical light curves , that rises too sharply to be fitted with an injection event .",
    "this is because of the eats and the homogeneity of the emitting region in our model , making the flux increase too smooth to fit the sharp rise and decline observed .",
    "this sharp bump may be due to an injection that is local in the sense that it only affects a small patch of the radiating shock front .",
    "we also note that the best fit is obtained by having the energy injection at @xmath140 , i.e.  just before the first optical data points , rather than at times just before the light curve bump .",
    "such an early injection does fit the flux levels in the various bands better than an injection that is constrained to lie within the time window of the observations .",
    "our model parameter values agree with those of @xcite within a factor of 2 or 3 , except for quantities that are defined differently ( such as @xmath148 ) . given the differences in approach and the different level of details in his work and ours , these differences are rather minor .    finally ,",
    "although energy injection that is uniform across the forward shock front is unable to account for the bump in the lightcurves at 3.5 days , other explanations may apply besides micro - lensing .",
    "these could be density inhomogeneities in the ambient medium or an inhomogeneous injection that energizes the emitting surface only partly ( patchy shell ) .",
    "grb  010222 had well time resolved afterglow light curves at most wavelengths and can be interpreted with the standard broken power law in the optical bands .",
    "the shallow slopes of the light curves require a hard electron energy distribution ( @xmath3 ) , if interpreted within the standard model .",
    "an unknown host extinction may influence the sed slope that in turn may lead to an inconsistent determination of @xmath2 , between the spectra and the light - curves .",
    "@xcite found that a continuous energy injection in an otherwise standard fireball model could explain both the light curves and seds without a hard electron energy distribution .",
    "we follow their suggestion and use continuous energy injection model to fit the afterglow data .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig:010222 ] where the data points have been corrected for galactic extinction of @xmath149 @xcite and intrinsic smc like extinction of @xmath144 using the profile of @xcite , that was also adopted by @xcite .",
    "the host of grb  010222 is a bright starburst galaxy @xcite and where available , the host contribution has been subtracted from the light curves .",
    "the fit resulted in @xmath150 with the model parameters presented in table  [ tab : fitpar ] .",
    "the fit is not particularly good , mainly because the model gives too high a flux at the radio wavelengths .",
    "both the optical and the x - ray data are well accounted for .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath17 is rather high ( table  [ tab : fitpar ] ) and the continuous energy injection ceases at approximately @xmath151 day , which along with the jet geometry ( @xmath152 at about 3 days ) , accounts for the steepening in the light curves . if we fit the data without the continuous energy injection , we obtain @xmath153 instead of 4.6 , with the additional contribution mainly due to a worse fit at radio wavelengths .",
    "the model parameters , however , are similar in both cases ; a narrow and energetic jet with a low magnetic field strength in a low density environment .",
    "the continuous energy injection thus better accounts for the radio light curves but otherwise the evolution in both cases is similar .",
    "we are therefore able to fit the optical data reasonably well within the standard model and still have @xmath154 .",
    "we have presented a detailed description of a relativistic fireball afterglow model with discrete and continuous energy injection .",
    "we have given explicit examples of fits to observations for both types of injections and shown how they can provide a better fit to afterglow measurements than the standard model with single initial energy release .",
    "although not a direct subject matter of the present paper , we note that even polarization measurements can in some cases be accounted for with the extended model  @xcite .",
    "however , interpreting afterglow polarimetry is not straightforward",
    ". first , polarization measurements are difficult as the polarization level in general seems to be small in afterglows .",
    "the data may therefore be sensitive to polarized contributions from other sources such as the host galaxy , which however is most likely to be constant .",
    "second , our model is sensitive to the geometry of the outflow and the assumed homogeneity of the emission region .",
    "the expanding shock front is unlikely to be homogeneous during its entire evolution , especially with the added energy injections .",
    "this is because an injected shell will not expand laterally in exactly the same way as the original shock front",
    ". the transverse size of the incoming shell will then be smaller and its energy deposition in the shock front will be concentrated in the contact zone between the two .",
    "accounting for the effects of the eats , could then lead to a rise in the level of polarization shortly after the injection and even abrupt changes in the polarization angle if the center of the colliding shell does not coincide with the geometrical center of the front .",
    "the origin of the additional shells is most likely the same as the origin of the shells producing the gamma ray burst in internal shocks .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the matter ejected from the central engine always collides and collects into one shell in the gamma ray burst event .",
    "the remaining shells will then be the ones to refresh the external shock later on in the evolution of the fireball",
    ". this might even be the case in most bursts , but goes unnoticed in many cases since the energy of the colliding shells must be of the same order or higher as the total accumulated energy of the front if their interaction is to produce a measurable brightening .",
    "when fitting grb afterglow light curves with the standard fireball model , it is quite common to use power law approximations with a light curve break due to jet structure . the slope of the light curve , @xmath136 , before and after the break is then used to determine the electron energy distribution index , @xmath2 , which is then compared to the value of @xmath2 inferred from the sed of the burst ( see e.g.  sari et al .",
    "these results must , however , be carefully considered , as the value of @xmath136 depends on @xmath155 as well ( see table  [ table : exps ] ) , and may not be smoothly varying between two fixed asymptotes , although that seems to be the general case .",
    "this is especially true when the characteristic frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are near the observing frequency , where the sed does not follow a power law .",
    "the light curve break time has traditionally been used to infer the jet opening angle from the assumption that it occurs when @xmath156 .",
    "this can lead to erroneous angle estimates , because energy injections can delay the appearance of the light curve break .",
    "an example of this is grb  021004 @xcite . as a result",
    ", the opening angle will be overestimated and the energy corrected for beaming may thus not be correct @xcite .",
    "studies based on such energy estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , should include error analysis that accounts for this bias.",
    "we approximate the synchrotron radiation power density , @xmath157 , in the comoving frame ( primed quantities ) with a smoothly joined power - law at the characteristic frequencies .",
    "this takes the form @xmath158^{-1/\\kappa_1 }                          \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\nu'}{\\nu_m'}\\right)^{(-1/2+p/2)(\\kappa_2)}\\right]^{-1/\\kappa_2}\\ ] ] for the fast cooling regime , @xmath159 , and @xmath160^{-1/\\kappa_3 }                          \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\nu'}{\\nu_c'}\\right)^{(-(p-1)/2+p/2)(\\kappa_4)}\\right]^{-1/\\kappa_4}\\ ] ] for the slow cooling regime , @xmath161 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the electron energy distribution index and @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the characteristic synchrotron frequencies corresponding , respectively , to the minimum lorentz factor of the distribution , @xmath164 and the lorentz factor above which electrons are radiative , @xmath165 here , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the mass of the proton and the electron , respectively , @xmath148 is the fraction of thermal energy in the electrons compared to the total thermal energy of the fireball , @xmath168 is the thompson scattering cross section .",
    "furthermore , @xmath169 is the dimensionless speed of the shock front and @xmath170 is the magnetic field strength , with @xmath171 the fraction of magnetic field energy compared to the total thermal energy of the fireball and @xmath172 is the density in the comoving frame .",
    "the characteristic frequencies are given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 is either @xmath175 or @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum values for the power density are given by @xmath176 where , @xmath177 , is the elementary charge and the parameters , @xmath178 and @xmath179 , are introduced here as in @xcite to account for an isotropic distribution of angles between the electron velocity and the magnetic field . comparing the results from these approximations with the more accurate calculations using the approach from @xcite , we find the following @xmath2-dependence of the exponents and coefficients in the fast cooling regime to be @xmath180 in the slow cooling regime , we find similarly , @xmath181 the difference between these approximations and the more accurate calculations is generally less than 10% unless @xmath134 is close to @xmath133",
    ". then the difference can be up to 40% .",
    "however , for most parameter sets the characteristic frequencies are close , only very early in the afterglow evolution and this is therefore not a concern in the later evolution .",
    "even then , the difference is mostly smoothed out because of the integration over the equal arrival time surface .",
    "we find the difference between the two solutions to be less than 10% for most realistic cases .",
    "we also remind the reader that the electron energy distribution is an approximation and little is known about the detailed microphysics of the shocked material ."
