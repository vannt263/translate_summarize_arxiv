    "noncommutative geometry was shown to provide a promising framework for unification of all fundamental interactions including gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "historically , the search to identify the structure of the noncommutative space followed the bottom - up approach where the known spectrum of the fermionic particles was used to determine the geometric data that defines the space .",
    "this bottom - up approach involved an interesting interplay with experiments . while at first the experimental evidence of neutrino oscillations contradicted the first attempt @xcite , it was realized several years later in 2006 ( @xcite ) that the obstruction to get neutrino oscillations was naturally eliminated by dropping the equality between the metric dimension of space - time ( which is equal to @xmath6 as far as we know ) and its @xmath7-dimension which is only defined modulo @xmath8 . when the latter is set equal to @xmath9 modulo @xmath8  @xcite , @xcite ( using the freedom to adjust the geometry of the finite space encoding the fine structure of space - time )",
    "everything works fine , the neutrino oscillations are there as well as the see - saw mechanism which appears for free as an unexpected bonus .",
    "incidentally , this also solved the fermionic doubling problem by allowing a simultaneous weyl - majorana condition on the fermions to halve the degrees of freedom .",
    "the second interplay with experiments occurred a bit later when it became clear that the mass of the brout - englert - higgs boson would not comply with the restriction ( that @xmath10 gev ) imposed by the validity of the standard model up to the unification scale .",
    "this obstruction to lower @xmath11 was overcome in @xcite simply by taking into account a scalar field which was already present in the full model which we had computed previously in @xcite .",
    "one lesson which we learned on that occasion is that we have to take all the fields of the noncommutative spectral model seriously , without making assumptions not backed up by valid analysis , especially because of the almost uniqueness of the standard model ( sm ) in the noncommutative setting .",
    "the sm continues to conform to all experimental data .",
    "the question remains whether this model will continue to hold at much higher energies , or whether there is a unified theory whose low - energy limit is the sm .",
    "one indication that there must be a new higher scale that effects the low energy sector is the small mass of the neutrinos which is explained through the see - saw mechanism with a majorana mass of at least of the order of @xmath12gev . in addition and as noted above , a scalar field which acquires a vev generating that mass scale can stabilize the higgs coupling and prevent it from becoming negative at higher energies and thus make it consistent with the low higgs mass of @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "another indication of the need to modify the sm at high energies is the failure ( by few percent ) of the three gauge couplings to be unified at some high scale which indicates that it may be necessary to add other matter couplings to change the slopes of the running of the rg  equations .",
    "this leads us to address the issue of the breaking from the natural algebra @xmath14 which results from the classification of irreducible finite geometries of @xmath7-dimension @xmath15 ( modulo @xmath8 ) performed in @xcite , to the algebra corresponding to the sm .",
    "this breaking was effected in @xcite , @xcite using the requirement of the first order condition on the dirac operator .",
    "the first order condition is the requirement that the dirac operator is a derivation of the algebra @xmath14 into the commutant of @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the charge conjugation operator .",
    "this in turn guarantees the gauge invariance and linearity of the inner fluctuations @xcite under the action of the gauge group given by the unitaries @xmath18 for any unitary @xmath19 .",
    "this condition was used as a mathematical requirement to select the maximal subalgebra @xmath20 which is compatible with the first order condition and is the main reason behind the unique selection of the sm .",
    "the existence of examples of noncommutative spaces where the first order condition is not satisfied such as quantum groups and quantum spheres provides a motive to remove this condition from the classification of noncommutative spaces compatible with unification @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this study was undertaken in a companion paper @xcite where it was shown that in the general case the inner fluctuations of @xmath21 form a semigroup in the product algebra @xmath22 , and acquire a quadratic part in addition to the linear part .",
    "physically , this new phenomena will have an impact on the structure of the higgs fields which are the components of the connection along discrete directions .",
    "this paper is devoted to the construction of the physical model that describes the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the methods used build on previous results and derivations developed over the years . to make this work more accessible",
    "we shall attempt to make the paper self - contained by including the parts needed from previous works in a brief form .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [",
    "sect : order1 ] we review the effect of removing the first order condition on the form of the inner fluctuations , emphasizing the semigroup structure . in section [",
    "sect : classif ] we modify the classification of irreducible finite geometries in the absence of the first order condition and show that the resultant algebra is , almost uniquely , given by @xmath23 the model is then based on a noncommutative geometric space formed as a product of a continuous four dimensional space times the above discrete space .",
    "the associated connection can be viewed either as a @xmath24 matrices , or in more manageable form as the tensor product of matrices . to present the computations in a comprehensible form that could be checked by others , we give in section [ sect : tensors ] a brief review of the tenorial notation we developped before .",
    "we stress that all calculations performed in this article using the tensorial method are done by hand , but have the advantage that they could also be checked using algebraic manipulation programs such as mathematica or maple . in section [",
    "sect : dirac ] we compute the inner fluctuations of the dirac operator on the above algebra and determine the field content . in section [ sect : sa ] we evaluate the spectral action using a cutoff function and the heat kernel expansion method , where we  show that the resultant model is the pati - salam @xcite @xmath25 type model with all the appropriate higgs fields necessary to break the symmetry to @xmath26 in section [ sect : sm ] we show that this model truncates correctly to the sm . in section [ sect : pot ] we analyze the potential and possible symmetry breaking , noting in particular the novel feature that for certain initial configurations of the dirac operator some of the inner fluctuations represented as higgs fields are fundamental while others are made of quadratic products of the fundamental ones . for generic initial dirac operators all higgs fields are fundamental . section [ sect : app ] is the appendix where all details of the calculation are given and where we illustrate the power and precision of noncommutative geometric methods by showing how all the physical fields arise .",
    "this is done to the benefit of researchers interested in becoming practitioners in the field .",
    "we briefly summarize the generalization of inner fluctuations to real spectral triples that fail on the first - order condition , as presented in @xcite . in this case",
    ", the usual prescription @xcite does not apply , since the operator @xmath27 with gauge potential @xmath28 $ ] @xmath29 does not behave well with respect to the action of the gauge group @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , one would require that conjugation of the fluctuated dirac operator by the unitary operator @xmath31 for @xmath32 can be implemented by a usual type of gauge transformation @xmath33 + uau^*$ ] so that @xmath34 however , the simple argument only works if @xmath35 = 0 $ ] for gauge potentials @xmath36 of the above form and @xmath32 , that is , if the first - order condition is satisfied .    for real spectral triples that possibly fail on",
    "the first - order condition one starts with a self - adjoint , _ universal _ one - form @xmath37 the inner fluctuations of a real spectral triple @xmath38 are then given by @xmath39 where @xmath40,\\\\ \\tilde a_{(1 ) } & : = \\sum_j \\hat a_j [ d,\\hat b_j ] ; \\qquad \\hat{a}_i = j a_i j^{-1 } , \\qquad \\hat{b}_i = j b_i j^{-1 } , \\\\",
    "a_{(2 ) } & : = \\sum_j \\hat a_j [ a_{(1 ) } , \\hat b_j ] = \\sum_{j , k } \\hat a_j a_k [ [ d , b_k ] , \\hat b_j].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly @xmath41 which depends quadratically on the fields in @xmath42 vanishes when the first order condition is satisfied , thus reducing to the usual formulation of inner fluctuations . as such , we will interpret the terms @xmath41 as non - linear corrections to the _ first - order _ , linear inner fluctuations @xmath42 of @xmath43 .",
    "the need for such quadratic terms can also be seen from the structure of _ pure gauge _",
    "fluctuations @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath32 . indeed , in the absence of the first order condition we find that @xmath46 + \\hat u [ d,\\hat u^ * ] + \\hat u[u[d , u^ * ] , \\hat u^*].\\ ] ] in the above prescription this corresponds to taking as a universal one - form @xmath47 .    on a fluctuated dirac operator @xmath48 such gauge transformation act in a similar way as @xmath49",
    ". by construction",
    ", it is implemented by the gauge transformation @xmath50 in the universal differential calculus .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath51\\ ] ] so the first - order inner fluctuations transform as usual . for the term @xmath41",
    "we compute that a gauge transformation acts as @xmath52,ju^ * j^{-1}]\\ ] ] where the @xmath41 on the right - hand - side is expressed using the gauge transformed @xmath42 .",
    "this non - linear gauge transformation for @xmath41 confirms our interpretation of @xmath41 as the non - linear contribution to the inner fluctuations .",
    "it turns out @xcite that inner fluctuations come from the action on operators in hilbert space of a semi - group @xmath53 of _ inner perturbations _ which only depends on the involutive algebra @xmath54 and extends the unitary group of @xmath54 .",
    "more precisely , the semi - group @xmath53 consists of _ normalized self - adjoint _ elements in @xmath55 : @xmath56 with @xmath57 the involutive algebra @xmath54 but with the opposite product @xmath58 .",
    "the semi - group product is inherited from the multiplication in the algebra @xmath55 , that is : @xmath59 which indeed respects the above normalization and self - adjointness condition .",
    "note that the unitary group of @xmath54 is mapped to @xmath53 by sending a unitary @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "given a spectral triple @xmath62 an inner fluctuation of @xmath21 by an element @xmath63 in @xmath53 is now simply given by @xmath64 this covers both cases of ordinary spectral triples and real spectral triples ( _ i.e. _  those which are equipped with the operator @xmath17 ) .",
    "in the latter case one simply uses the natural homomorphism of semi - groups @xmath65 given by @xmath66 .",
    "explicitly , this implies for real spectral triples the following transformation rule : @xmath67 which can indeed be shown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5 ) to coincide with the above .",
    "the structure of a semi - group implies in particular that inner fluctuations of inner fluctuations are still inner fluctuations a fact which is not at all direct when looking at equation  and that the corresponding algebraic rules are unchanged by passing from ordinary spectral triples to real spectral triples .",
    "some time ago the question of classifying finite noncommutative spaces was carried out in @xcite .",
    "the main restriction came from requiring that spinors which belong to the product of the continuous four dimensional space , times the finite space must be such that the conjugate spinor is not an independent field , in order to avoid doubling the fermions .",
    "this could only be achieved when the spinors satisfy both the majorana and weyl conditions , which implies that the @xmath7-dimension of the finite space be @xmath15 ( mod @xmath8 ) .",
    "consistency with the zeroth order condition @xmath68   = 0\\,,\\quad b^{\\circ}=jb^{\\ast}j^{-1},~\\forall a , b\\in\\mathcal{a}\\ ] ] ( since @xmath14 is an involutive algebra this condition is the same if one replaces @xmath69 by @xmath70 ) restricts the center of the complexified algebra to be @xmath71 the dimension of the hilbert space is then restricted to be the square of an integer .",
    "the algebra is then of the form@xmath72 a symplectic symmetry imposed on the first algebra forces @xmath73 to be even @xmath74 and the algebra to be of quaternionic matrices of the form @xmath75 the existence of the chirality operator breaks @xmath76 and further restricts the integer @xmath77 to be even , and thus the number of fundamental fermions must be of the form @xmath78 where @xmath77 is an even integer .",
    "this shows that the first possible realistic case is the finite space with @xmath79 to be based on the algebra @xmath80 a further restriction arises from the first order condition requiring the commutation of the commutator @xmath81   $ ] where @xmath21 is the dirac operator and @xmath82 with elements @xmath69 , @xmath83 , @xmath84   , b^{\\circ}\\right ]   = 0,\\qquad a , b\\in\\mathcal{a},\\qquad b^{\\circ}=jb^{\\ast}j^{-1}\\ ] ] ( since @xmath14 is an involutive algebra this condition is the same if one replaces @xmath69 by @xmath70 ) this condition , together with the requirement that the neutrinos must acquire a majorana mass restricts the above algebra further to the subalgebra @xmath85 the question is whether the first order condition is an essential requirement for noncommutative spaces .",
    "there are known examples of noncommutative spaces where the first order condition is not satisfied such as the quantum group @xmath86 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as recalled in the previous section , the main novelty of not imposing the first order condition is that the fluctuations of the dirac operator ( gauge and higgs fields ) will not be linear anymore and part of it @xmath87 will depend quadratically on the fields appearing in @xmath88 in this work we shall study the resulting noncommutative space without imposing the first order condition on the dirac operator .",
    "our starting point , however , will be an initial dirac operator ( without fluctuations ) satisfying the first order condition relative to the subalgebra , but inner fluctuations would spoil this property .    the noncommutative geometric setting provided answers to some of the basic questions about the sm , such as the number of fermions in one family , the nature of the gauge symmetries and their fields , the fermionic representations , the higgs fields as gauge fields along discrete directions , the phenomena of spontaneous symmetry breaking as well many other explanations @xcite . in other words ,",
    "noncommutative geometry successfully gave a geometric setting for the sm .",
    "the dynamics of the model was then determined by the spectral action principle which is based on the idea that all the geometric invariants of the space can be found in the spectrum of the dirac operator of the associated space .",
    "indeed it was shown that the spectral action , which is a function of the dirac operator , can be computed and gives the action of the sm coupled to gravity valid at some high energy scale . when the couplings appearing in this action are calculated at low energies by running the rg equations one finds excellent agreement with all known results to within few percents .",
    "the first order condition is what restricted a more general gauge symmetry based on the algebra @xmath89 to the subalgebra @xmath90 it is thus essential to understand the physical significance of such a requirement .",
    "in what follows we shall examine the more general algebra allowed without the first order condition , and shall show that the number of fundamental fermions is still dictated to be @xmath1 .",
    "we determine the inner automorphisms of the algebra @xmath14 and show that the resulting gauge symmetry is a pati - salam type left - right model @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the color group with the lepton number as the fourth color .",
    "in addition we observe that the higgs fields appearing in @xmath87 are composite and depend quadratically on those appearing in @xmath93 provided that the initial dirac operator ( without fluctuations ) satisfies the order one condition relative to the subalgebra",
    ". otherwise , there will be additional fundamental higgs fields .",
    "in particular , the representations of the fundamental higgs fields when the initial dirac operator satisfies the order one condition are @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 with respect to @xmath97 when such an order one condition is not satisfied for the initial dirac operator , the representations of the additional higgs fields are @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 there are simplifications if the yukawa coupling of the up quark is equated with that of the neutrino and of the down quark equated with that of the electron .",
    "in addition the @xmath101 of @xmath102 decouple if we assume that at unification scale there is exact @xmath92 symmetry between the quarks and leptons .",
    "the resulting model is very similar to the one considered by marshak and mohapatra @xcite .",
    "although it is possible to use matrix notation to deal with the physical model , the fact that the matrix representation ( which is a product of matrices ) is @xmath24 dimensional making the task daunting and not very transparent , although only involving products of matrices . we find it much more efficient and practical to use a tensorial notation which simplifies greatly the algebraic operations .",
    "this also has the added advantage of allowing to check all the steps using computer programs with algebraic manipulations such as mathematica and maple .",
    "we will restrict to the case where @xmath103 an element of the hilbert space @xmath104 is represented by @xmath105{c}\\psi_{a}\\\\ \\psi_{a^{^{\\prime}}}\\end{array } \\right )   , \\quad\\psi_{a^{\\prime}}=\\psi_{a}^{c}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the conjugate spinor to @xmath107 thus all primed indices @xmath108 correspond to the hilbert space of conjugage spinors .",
