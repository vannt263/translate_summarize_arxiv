    "understanding the nature of the first stars in the universe is , in principle , a very straightforward problem to solve .",
    "the initial conditions are defined by well - constrained cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) and accepted calculations of big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relative simplicity of the chemistry of primordial gas , along with powerful numerical methods , have made it possible to accurately characterize the formation process of primordial stars from the assembly of their dark matter halos through the end of the optically - thin regime of the collapsing protostar @xcite .",
    "results from theory and numerical simulations suggest that the first stars were 10s to 100s @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation , however , involves simulating the complex processes of accretion and radiative feedback , a capability currently just beyond the state of the art .",
    "in contrast , the challenge of understanding the second generation of stars is significantly more complex .",
    "the initial conditions of the first stars essentially depend only on the principles of cold dark matter cosmology and the properties of molecular hydrogen , but the initial conditions of the second stars require a complete solution to the formation and evolution of their predecessors as well as host of additional chemistry and physical processes .",
    "the chemical composition and physical conditions of second - generation star - forming environments strongly depend on the exact masses of the first stars @xcite and the mechanics of their supernovae @xcite .    at the heart of the problem regarding forming the second stars",
    "is understanding how the star formation process is altered by the introduction of the first metals in the universe , created in the explosions of the first stars .",
    "the chemical composition of a gas determines the efficiency with which it can cool radiatively .",
    "cold , metal - free gas ( @xmath6 k ) cools solely through ro - vibrational lines of h@xmath7 , whose lowest - lying transition has an energy equivalent temperature of @xmath8 512 k , resulting in a minimum achievable temperature of @xmath8 200 k. the energy levels of h@xmath7 become thermalized at rather low densities ,",
    "@xmath9 @xmath8 10@xmath10 @xmath11 , where @xmath9 is the number density , above which the cooling rate is only proportional to @xmath9 , instead of @xmath12 .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that this creates a stalling point in the star formation process , where the free - fall collapse of metal - free gas comes to a halt as the cooling time increases to be significantly above the dynamical time @xcite .",
    "entry into this ` loitering ' phase marks the end of hierarchical fragmentation that occurs during the free - fall period , a fragmentation that occurs because the temperature is able to continually decrease with increasing density . the final fragmentation mass scale is then set by the jeans mass at the temperature and density corresponding to the point where the gas can no longer get colder with increasing density @xcite . in the metal - free case ,",
    "this yields a mass scale of @xmath8 1000 @xmath3 , resulting in the high - mass nature of the first stars .",
    "the addition of metals enhances the cooling rate at low temperatures through fine - structure and molecular transitions , as well as by continuum emission from dust grains . at",
    "low to moderate densities ( @xmath13 10@xmath14 @xmath11 ) , only metals in the gas phase contribute significantly to the cooling , unless the level of metal enrichment is very high @xcite . in the phases where h@xmath7 cooling is strong ( @xmath15 @xmath11 , an increase in the cooling due to metals",
    "is first seen only at temperatures less than the 200 k temperature minimum that exists in metal - free star formation @xcite . at abundances of @xmath16",
    "10@xmath17 @xmath18 , where metal cooling is only significant for @xmath19 200 k , the low - density evolution of the cloud is identical to the metal - free case @xcite . at higher metallicities ,",
    "gas - phase metal cooling becomes strong enough for the collapsing cloud to bypass the loitering phase and to undergo continued fragmentation @xcite .",
    "if dust grains are present , their influence becomes important at very high densities ( @xmath20 10@xmath21 @xmath11 ) .",
    "this has been shown to induce fragmentation for metallicities as low as 10@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "calculations by @xcite predict that up to 30% of the progenitor mass is converted into dust in a pair - instability supernova , but observations of type ii supernova in the local universe remnants have not returned conclusive evidence of dust @xcite . in the context of star formation in the early universe ,",
    "the arrival at this critical metallicity , @xmath0 , at which fragmentation occurs beyond the capabilities of primordial gas , is predicted to be the point where the universal mode of star formation shifts permanently from the high - mass , solitary mode of the first stars , to the low - mass , multiply - producing mode that is presently observed @xcite .",

    "these simulations had a mass resolution of only 100 @xmath3 and were , therefore , unable to investigate the formation of solar - mass stars .",
    "more recently , @xcite have performed a series of high - resolution simulations of metal - enriched gas collapse that were able to follow the evolution of gas fragments to sub - solar mass scales .",
    "they , too , find that gas with metallicities , @xmath38 @xmath39 10@xmath33 @xmath18 will fragment into multiple clumps , while gas with @xmath38 @xmath40 10@xmath17 @xmath18 will produce only one object .",
    "however , @xcite reported the existence of regions in density and temperature that are thermally unstable in gas with metallicities as low as 10@xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "fragmentation is traditionally thought to happen when the cooling time is less than the dynamical time , as the gas is able to cool and form perturbations before they can be smoothed out by sound waves .",
    "when this condition , referred to as the fragmentation criterion , is satisfied , fragmentation can also be aided by thermal instabilities @xcite , where a slight decrease in temperature or increase in density leads to a higher cooling rate , causing differences in temperature between pockets of gas to grow in a runaway fashion . in the adaptive mesh refinement simulations of @xcite ,",
    "grid refinement was performed based on baryon and dark matter overdensities and by ensuring that the truelove criterion , @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 , where @xmath41 is the local jeans length and @xmath43 is the grid cell size , was satisfied @xcite .",
    "however , refinement was not performed when the cooling time was less than the hydrodynamic time - step . while this was not explicitly wrong , since the radiative cooling solver iterates with time - steps that are no larger than 10% of the cooling time , it may have artificially suppressed the growth of thermal instabilities that could have formed extra fragments .",
    "we rerun the simulations of @xcite with an additional refinement criterion which ensures that the hydrodynamic time - step is always less than the cooling time on the finest level of resolution .",

    "the cosmological parameters have the following values : @xmath46 = 0.3 , @xmath47 = 0.7 , @xmath48 = 0.04 , and hubble constant , @xmath49 = 0.7 , in units of 100 km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50 . the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations is given by @xcite , with @xmath51 = 0.9 and @xmath9 = 1 .",
    "refined grids are created during the simulations when the baryon ( dark matter ) density is 4 ( 8) times greater than the mean density at that level . the density threshold for refinement decreases at higher levels .",
    "the local jeans length is resolved by a minimum of 16 grid cells at all times , exceeding the truelove criterion @xcite by a factor of four along each coordinate axis .",
    "in addition , grid refinement occurs whenever the cooling time drops below the integration time step of the hydrodynamic solver .",
    "this final refinement criterion was not used in @xcite . during the simulation",
    ", a grid cell is flagged for refinement if one or more of any of these criteria are met .",
    "we perform three sets of simulations . qualitatively , the three sets are the same .",
    "they each have the same cosmological parameters , box size , and resolution .",
    "the only difference between them is that their initial conditions were created with three unique randomizations of the initial density and velocity perturbations .",
    "thus , they represent three different realizations of the same problem .",
    "the first set of initial conditions is the one used by @xcite .",
    "the second and third sets were initially used by @xcite and correspond to the runs named l0_30a and l0_30d in that work . for each set of initial conditions , we perform a metal - free control run . excluding the control runs , we run 10 simulations using initial condtions set 1 , with metallicities ranging from 10@xmath52 to 10@xmath53 , 5 simulations using set 2 , and 6 simulations using set 3 , with metallicities from 10@xmath54 to 10@xmath53 for sets 2 and 3 .",

    "see @xcite for a full discussion of this method .",
    "we neglect cooling from hd , as @xcite found its contribution to be negligible in situations where the initial ionization is low , such as in this work .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by @xcite that when the initial ionization is high , the hd fraction can become enhanced to the point where hd cooling is important .",
    "heating from h@xmath7 formation is not included in the chemical network .",
    "this may contribute a significant source of heat when h@xmath7 formation via three - body reactions becomes important at @xmath56 @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "the population iii stars responsible for the enrichment of the gas in our simulations have died , and we assume any living pop iii stars are most likely too distant to contribute significant amounts of radiation . a major difference between our simulations and those of @xcite is the choice of h@xmath7 cooling rates .",
    "we use the updated h@xmath7 cooling rates of , whereas @xcite used the older rates of @xcite .",
    "the rates of are generally lower than those of @xcite , causing the gas to take longer to cool in the newer simulations . as a result",

    "we use @xmath72 to avoid confusion with the term , @xmath73 , which is often expressed in units of [ erg s@xmath50 cm@xmath45 ] .",

    "the results are shown in table [ tab : zcrit ] .",
    "the systematic shift toward lower values of z@xmath78 compared to previous calculations is most likely due to the fact that the minimum temperatures are slightly higher than 200 k , where both the h@xmath7 and metal cooling rates are higher .",
    "in addition , cooling from h@xmath7 was not included in the calculation of @xcite , meaning that more cooling from the metals would have been required .",
    "there is a correlation between @xmath0 and the collapse redshift of the simulation , with the highest value of @xmath0 coming from the highest collapse redshift , despite the lack of such a correlation for @xmath9 , @xmath79 , or @xmath63 .",
    "however , there is a correlation between the h@xmath7 fraction and collapse redshift , which has been observed in the pop iii simulations of @xcite .",
    "they find that the higher h@xmath7 fractions result from the generally warmer gas in halos that collapse at higher redshifts , which is simply a function of the linear dependence upon redshift of the virial temperature",
    ". this may be the dominant factor , but with only 3 data points it is unclear whether the observed trend is even significant .",
    "in addition , the artificial nature of our initial conditions may make this finding inapplicable to the real world .",
    "we see a trend with metallicity and collapse redshift that is similar to what was reported by @xcite , where simulations with higher metallicities reach the runaway collapse phase earlier .",
    "we define @xmath80 as the difference in time to runaway collapse between a simulation with non - zero metallicity and the metal - free run with the same initial conditions .",
    "an increase in metallicity by 0.5 dex results in an increase in @xmath80 by a factor of approximately 1.3 to 4 .",

    "in addition , within individual runs , an increase in the gas temperature is matched by an increase in the density .",
    "the instantaneous accretion rate at a given radius is a function of the infall velocity at that position . although there are some exceptions , the correlation between temperature / sound speed and infall velocity , with higher temperatures / sound speeds corresponding to higher velocities , generally holds .",

    "we find that the inflow is roughly transonic throughout the entire density range , showing that even though the collapsing clouds are not isothermal spheres , their accretion rates are still largely regulated by the sound speed .",
    "the fragmentation of collapsing gas depends sensitively on its thermal evolution , which is effectively a measure of the radiative cooling properties of the gas as a function of density and temperature . since our radiative cooling method ,",

    "we calculate values of the absorption coefficient , @xmath99 , as a function of density , metallicity , temperature , and frequency .",
    "equation [ eqn : tau ] then takes the form @xmath100 for metallicities @xmath101 and in the absence of dust , metal cooling is dominated by fine - structure transitions of oi and feii @xcite . in figure [ fig : tau_n_08 ] , we plot the optical depth from equation [ eqn : tau_sim ] for the feii line at 25.99 @xmath102 m and the oi line at 63.18 @xmath102 m as a function of density using the spherically - averaged densities and temperatures shown in figure [ fig : radial_08 ] . at low energies and in the absence of dust grains , the largest contributor to the opacity is free - free absorption , which is dominated by h for low metallicities . as a result , the opacity in the energy range of interest is essentially independent of metallicity for metallicities less than solar .",
    "when the metals become a considerable fraction of the total gas content , above @xmath103 or so , the opacity at low energy for dust - free gas begins to grow with metallicity . in figure",
    "[ fig : tau_n_08 ] , the apparent decrease in the optical depth at the highest metallicities is due to the flattening of the density profile at small radii . as such ,",
    "the final point for each curve in figure [ fig : tau_n_08 ] should be ignored . for values inside the point where the density profile flattens , it would be more reasonable to use the radius at which the density turns over for the calculation of @xmath104 .",
    "fortunately , @xmath104 remains significantly less than 1 throughout all of our simulations , peaking at roughly 0.25 at the highest densities for the runs with the lowest metallicities .",
    "the lower optical depth in the higher metallicity runs is due to the smaller characteristic size of the core , as seen in figure [ fig : radial_08]a .",
    "it should also be noted that some molecules are missing from the cloudy dust - free chemistry network that could contribute to the opacity , such as tio .",
    "as such , the optical depths calculated could be slightly higher for the high metallicity simulations .",
    "however , we show in  [ sec : frag ] that fragmentation in our simulations occurs well before this becomes a concern .",
    "in order to quantify the degree of fragmentation within each run , we employ a clump finding algorithm to search for bound clumps within 5 pc of the density maximum . as in @xcite , we define a clump , there referred to as a fragment , as `` the mass contained between a local density maximum and the lowest isodensity surface surrounding only that maximum , '' to quote that work .",
    "we begin by identifying all grid cells within a sphere of radius 5 pc , centered on the point of maximum density .",

    "the onset of rapid h@xmath7 formation occurs slightly earlier ( within a factor of a few in density ) in the runs with higher metallicity due to the @xmath115 dependence of the three - body rate coefficients .",

    "the lone exception is run r3_z-3 , where fragmentation occurs at @xmath131 @xmath11 and h@xmath7 formation heating matches the total cooling at @xmath122 @xmath11 . however , the core in this simulation does not fragment until it has already begun to reheat due to adiabatic compression , so it is not clear what effect the inclusion of this missing heating term would have had",
    ".    in figures [ fig : t_n_08 ] and [ fig : t_n_real ] , we plot the number density vs. gas temperature for the final output of each simulation . due to the self - similar nature of the collapse , figures [ fig : t_n_08 ] and [ fig : t_n_real ] can also be used to understand the evolution of the central core throughout the collapse . in all the runs with @xmath132 ,",

    ", the gas cools all the way to the temperature of the cmb .",
    "the cooling proceeds so efficiently that the gas has not had sufficient time to reach high densities before hitting the temperature floor of the cmb .",
    "fragmentation can only continue as long as the temperature decreases with increasing density @xcite .",
    "although the temperature decreases slightly in runs r1_z-2.5 and r1_z-2 for densities greater than 10@xmath45 @xmath11 , the temperature minimum is effectively at @xmath9 = 10@xmath45 @xmath11 , where the gas reaches the cmb temperature . near the cmb temperature ,",

    "therefore , when the gas reaches the cmb temperature , the cooling rate drops to zero , and the cooling time becomes infinite .",
    "the gas cloud becomes extremely thermally stable , preventing further fragmentation .    to verify that the cmb is indeed suppressing fragmentation , we run one simulation , r3_z-2_nocmb , with the cmb temperature floor removed .",
    "we choose initial conditions set 3 for this exercise since it has the highest cmb temperature at the redshift of collapse and should therefore show the greatest contrast with the cmb removed . in figure",
    "[ fig : proj_cmb ] , we show mass - weighted mean number density projections of the central 5 pc for runs , r3_mf , r3_z-2 , and r3_z-2_nocmb .",
    "run r3_z-2 has a much clumpier structure than its metal - free counterpart , even with the cmb temperature floor present .",
    "however , when the temperature floor is removed , the gas is able to collapse into a long , thin filament with far more small - scale structure .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : clumps ] , we find the most bound clumps in this run ( 4 within 1 pc of the density peak and 1 more within 5 pc ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : proj_cmb_temp ] , we show mass - weighted mean temperature projections for the same runs as figure [ fig : proj_cmb ] .",

    "the 2 largest contours roughly represent the 2 bound clumps found within the 5 pc radius sphere .",
    "the gas within the clumps has a very uniform temperature , as its cooling has been abruptly halted at the cmb temperature ( @xmath871 k ) .",
    "the 2 clumps have masses of roughly 100 and 300 @xmath3 .",
    "it is unlikely that they will fragment further , since the jeans mass of each clump is nearly equivalent to its total mass . at a temperature of 71 k",
    ", sound waves will travel @xmath81.7 pc in the 1.9 myr required for any additional fragments to increase in density by an order of magnitude once they have cooled to the cmb temperature .",
    "any additional fragments that might possibly condense out of lower densitiy gas must be approximately this large in order to collapse , suggesting they will also be very massive .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two bound clumps in the simulation are also about this size .",
    "in contrast , the gas inside the contours of run r3_z-2nocmb shows significantly more structure in temperature .",
    "the cold knots in run r3_z-2nocmb seen in figure [ fig : proj_cmb_temp ] correspond to the high density regions seen in figure [ fig : proj_cmb ] .",
    "4 of the 5 bound clumps are jeans unstable , with masses of 4 , 4 , 12 , and 33 @xmath3 .",
    "the fifth , with @xmath134 , is approximately 1/6 of its jeans mass .",
    "the most massive clump is about 5 times more massive than its jeans mass .",
    "we have shown that fragmentation occurs within a collapsing cloud when the metallicity is above the critical metallicity .",
    "the exact value of the critical metallicity required to prevent an increase in temperature at the stalling point of h@xmath7 varies slightly from halo to halo . within our three sets of initial conditions ,",
    "the values of @xmath0 are correlated to the collapse redshift of the metal - free runs , with the highest z@xmath78 corresponding to the highest redshift .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this is significant .",
    "if the metallicity is only marginally higher than @xmath0 , fragmentation is unlikely to occur , as the increase in temperature at the h@xmath7 stalling point is only delayed momentarily .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that a sharp transition in star formation mode occurs at just the moment when the critical metallicity is reached .",
    "fragmentation is suppressed when the metallicity is high enough such that the gas is able to cool to the temperature of the cmb when the central density is still relatively low .",
    "we confirm that the cmb is responsible for the observed suppression of fragmentation by running an identical simulation without the cmb . in this simulation",
    "where the cmb is absent , we find more bound clumps than in any other of the runs in this study .",
    "2 bound clumps were found in run r3_z-2 , where the gas was able to cool to the cmb temperature .",
    "however , both of these clumps were quite massive ( @xmath135 ) , and we showed in  [ sec : frag ] that is is unlikely that they will fragment into smaller objects .",
    "we observe a small amount of variance in the metallicity range in which fragmentation occurs that does not appear to be related to the cmb .",
    "just as the exact value of @xmath0 seems to vary from halo to halo , we suspect that the range of metallicities where fragmentation occurs will also be influenced by the individual properties of a halo as well as its particular evolution",
    ".    the mass scale of collapsing clumps can be estimated from the jeans mass at the end of the cooling phase .",
    "this implies the existence of three distinct metallicity regimes for star formation . in the first regime , @xmath38 @xmath136 @xmath0 , which we refer to as the ` primordial ' mode , metals do not provide enough additional cooling to allow the gas temperature to continue to decrease monotonically with increasing density when the core reaches the h@xmath7 thermalization density . in this case",
    ", the collapse proceeds in a similar way to the metal - free scenario , resulting in the formation of a single , massive object .",
    "there is also the potential for stars forming in this mode to be somewhat less massive than the very first stars .",
    "the fragmentation mass scale for extremely low metallicity gas ( @xmath137 ) may be lowered though compression by shocks from pop iii supernovae and enhanced cooling from hd in relic hii regions @xcite .    at the other extreme",
    ", we define @xmath138 as the metallicity at which the gas can cool to the cmb temperature .",
    "when @xmath139 , the cloud - core will efficiently cool to the temperature of the cmb when the central density is still relatively low . in this scenario ,",
    "fragmentation is limited by cooling rapidly to the cmb temperature , as the mass scale is determined by the jeans mass at the density when the core first reaches the cmb temperature .",
    "we refer to this as the cmb - regulated star formation mode , similar to @xcite . as fragmentation",
    "is severely limited in this mode , these stars will most likely be more massive on average than the characteristic mass of stars forming today .",
    "finally , our simulations have shown that there exists a special range in metallicity , @xmath140 , where the core does not reheat at the metal - free stalling point , but also can not cool all the way to the cmb temperature .",
    "the minimum temperature is set only by the balance of radiative cooling and adiabatic heating .",
    "the mass scale is not regulated externally by the cmb , but rather internally by the metallicity - dependent gas - cooling .",
    "hence , we term this the metallicity - regulated star formation mode .",
    "this mode produces the lowest mass stars of the three modes mentioned .",
    "the cmb - regulated star formation mode creates a means by which a higher number of massive stars are formed in very early universe , when the cmb temperature was much higher .",
    "as the universe evolves , the cmb temperature will slowly decrease , which will increase the metallicity required to reach the cmb temperature , referred to here as @xmath138 .",
    "the decrease in the cmb temperature also means that the fragmentation mass scale will be lower at the point where the gas reaches the temperature floor .",
    "thus , the characteristic mass of stars produced by the cmb - regulated mode will slowly decrease with time .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the model of an imf that evolves with redshift formulated by @xcite . as the metallicity threshhold for",
    "the cmb - regulated mode advances to higher metallicity , the range of operation of the metallicity - regulated mode will extend to take its place .",
    "we lack sufficient data in this study to predict the evolution of @xmath138 with redshift .",
    "however , in a paper to follow , we will map out the evolution of @xmath138 vs. @xmath57 with additional simulations collapsing as much lower redshifts",
    ". observations of nearby star - forming clouds show that the minimum achievable temperature in the local universe is roughly 10 k ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this implied that the cmb - regulated star formation mode is in operation up to @xmath141 , at the absolute latest .",
    "a growing amount of evidence has been presented that the stellar imf evolves with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite report evidence from high redshift that the imf may deviate from the standard salpeter imf , favoring higher mass stars for @xmath142 2 - 4 .",
    "if dust is present in the very early universe , this would extend the range of the metallicity - regulated star formation mode to metallicities as low as @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the existence of low mass , hyper metal poor stars , he0107 - 5240 @xcite , and he1327 - 2326 @xcite , both with [ fe / h ] @xmath42 -5 , may provide evidence of this .",
    "both of these stars show extremely enhanced c and o abundances , which would make their effective metallicities ( in terms of the radiative cooling ability of gas with that abundance ) much higher .",
    "however , it is pointed out by @xcite , that the abundance patterns of these stars are best recreated by a scenario in which the c and o enhancement comes via binary mass transfer from an intermediate mass agb star , meaning the stars are truly metal poor . in that case",
    ", these two low - mass stars would likely require dust in order to form at such low metallicity .",
    "@xcite also shows that such a high fraction of carbon enhanced metal poor stars ( cemps ) requires a higher than normal fraction of more massive stars that go through the agb phase .",
    "@xcite claims that the evolution of cemp fraction with metallicity ( with a higher cemp fraction at lower metallicity ) already shows the influence of the cmb on the imf . if a cemp star and its binary companion were formed from gas at the same metallicity , there would have to be process at work that would prevent the dust cooling fragmentation from forming only low mass stars .",
    "the star formation models of @xcite do not indicate that the dust cooling phase that induces low mass fragmentation is able to reach the cmb temperature for @xmath144 .",
    "this may simply imply that metal mixing from the first supernovae is higly heterogeneous , allowing stars to form simultaneously with largely different abundances .    in this work , we study only gas clouds with solar abundance patterns .",
    "most likely , the first metals in the universe will not have solar abundance patterns . however , from the perspective of simulating metal - enriched star formation , it is not the specific elemental abundances of a gas cloud that are important , but rather the total cooling rate produced by the gas . therefore , given that it is the sum of the metals that is important , and not the abundance pattern , the results of this work are robust in spite of the fact that the abundance patterns used are likely to be incorrect .",
    "there appears to be some discrepancy between our results and those of @xcite , who see no evidence of fragmentation induced by gas - phase metal cooling .",
    "this is potentially resolved by the fact that in that work , the gas collapse is only strictly followed up to densities of 5@xmath145 @xmath11 before sink particles are created .",
    "figures [ fig : t_n_08 ] and [ fig : t_n_real ] show very little difference in the thermal structure of the gas for densities below 5@xmath145 @xmath11 .",
    "additionally , our clump finding algorithm found only a single bound clump within every simulation when the analysis was performed on data outputs that were made when the maximum density was only @xmath146 @xmath11 .",
    "multiple clumps were only found when the clouds had reached somewhat higher densities .",
    "finally , the simulations in this work began with cold , neutral gas , whereas their simulations began with hot , ionized gas . had their simulations been run to higher densities , any dissimilarities might also be due to using different initial conditions .",
    "we have performed a series of high resolution simulations of metal - enriched star formation using cosmological , pop iii style initial conditions , and assuming fully homogeneous metal enrichment .",
    "we have shown that our results apply to more than a single star forming region by using 3 different sets of initial conditions with identical cosmological parameters and resolution , but with 3 unique random seeds with which to create the initial perturbations in the density and velocity fields . from the results of these simulations ,",
    "the main conclusions of this work are :    \\1 .",
    "fragmentation does not occur when the metallicity is only slightly above @xmath0 , since this only leads to a small delay in the onset of the loitering phase that is brought on by a decrease in the efficiency of h@xmath7 cooling .",
    "the density at which the temperature begins to increase with increasing density is only marginally higher than in the metal - free case , and therefore does not lead to a signicant lowering of the minimum jeans mass . within our simulations , @xmath0 is roughly 10@xmath147 .",
    "we find that fragmentation does not occur until the metallicity is roughly 0.5 dex above @xmath0 .",
    "fragmentation is suppressed when the metallicity is high enough such that the gas is able to cool to the temperature of the cmb when the density of the collapsing cloud is still relatively low ( @xmath148 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the jeans mass at the density and temperature at which the cloud first reaches the cmb temperature sets the minimum fragmentation mass within the cloud , and as such only massive clumps are able to form .",
    "metal - enriched star formation occurs in three modes that are separated by two metallicity thresholds , @xmath0 and @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath0 is the conventional critical metallicity and @xmath138 is the metallicity at which the gas is able to cool to the temperature of the cmb at a given redshift . at the approximate collapse redshifts of our simulations , @xmath149 , @xmath138 is between 10@xmath33 and 10@xmath150 .",
    "the three modes of star formation are :    * the primordial mode ( @xmath132 ) - the additional cooling provided by the metals is not enough to significantly alter the thermal structure of the cloud relative to the metal - free case .",
    "no fragmentation occurs and the star will have a mass similar to a pop iii star . * the metallicity - regulated mode ( @xmath151 ) - metal cooling is high enough to allow the cloud to continue to cool past the metal - free loitering phase , but not high enough to cool it to the temperature of the cmb .",
    "the minimum fragmentation mass is set at lower temperatures and higher densities than in the primordial case and fragmentation into multiple objects occurs .",
    "based on the masses of clumps formed within our simulations , stars forming in this mode could have masses of the order of a few @xmath3 or less . *",
    "the cmb - regulated mode ( @xmath152 ) - fragmentation is suppressed when the cloud is able to cool to the cmb temperature , as is described in point 2 of the conclusions . at minimum , stars forming in the cmb - regulated mode will be more massive than stars forming in the metallicity - regulated mode .",
    "@xmath138 will increase as the cmb temperature lowers with time .",
    "as such , the masses of stars forming in the cmb - regulated mode will slowly decrease .",

    "<S> , we use initial conditions identical to a pop iii star formation simulation , with low ionization and no external radiation other than the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . for metallicities below the critical metallicity , @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , collapse proceeds similarly to the metal - free case , and only massive objects form . for metallicities well above @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> efficient cooling rapidly lowers the gas temperature to the temperature of the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> the gas is unable to radiatively cool below the cmb temperature , and becomes thermally stable . for high metallicities , @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> this occurs early in the evolution of the gas cloud , when the density is still relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cloud - cores show little or no fragmentation , and would most likely form massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> if the metallicity is not vastly above @xmath0 , the cloud cools efficiently but does not reach the cmb temperature , and fragmentation into multiple objects occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that there were three distinct modes of star formation at high redshift ( @xmath2 ) : a ` primordial ' mode , producing massive stars ( 10s to 100s @xmath3 ) at very low metallicities ( @xmath4 ) ; a cmb - regulated mode , producing moderate mass ( 10s of @xmath3 ) stars at high metallicites ( @xmath1 at redshift @xmath515 - 20 ) ; and a low - mass ( a few @xmath3 ) mode existing between those two metallicities . as the universe ages and the cmb temperature decreases </S>",
    "<S> , the range of the low mass mode extends to higher metallicities , eventually becoming the only mode of star formation . </S>"
