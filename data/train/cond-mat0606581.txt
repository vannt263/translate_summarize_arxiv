    "the kondo effect in superconductors has been studied over three decades . @xcite",
    "it was shown in early years that the competition between the superconducting ( sc ) gap and kondo energy scale @xmath10 determines the low - temperature properties .",
    "the sc energy gap @xmath11 disturbs the conduction - electron screening of the local moment .",
    "the ground state becomes a magnetic doublet for @xmath12 , while the ground state is still a nonmagnetic singlet for @xmath13 .",
    "these aspects of the kondo physics in superconductors have been re - examined precisely by efficient numerical methods such as the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite and numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approaches .",
    "@xcite    in quantum dots embedded in a josephson junction , new interesting features have been predicted to be observed @xcite and some experiments have been reported .",
    "@xcite particularly , the screening of the local moment in the quantum dot is affected not only by the size of the two sc gaps but also by the josephson phase @xmath14 between the two sc leads on the left and right .",
    "the phase difference @xmath14 also induces the josephson current flowing through the dot .",
    "it can drive a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between the singlet and doublet ground states , and at the critical point the direction of the current changes discontinuously .",
    "these properties of the sc - dot - sc systems have been studied with various theoretical approaches ; such as the noncrossing approximation,@xcite slave - boson mean - field theory,@xcite perturbation theory in the coulomb interaction @xmath2,@xcite qmc,@xcite and nrg.@xcite so far , however , most of the calculations have been carried out assuming a highly symmetric condition as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the left lead has been shown to be separated from the rest of the system , which consists of the dot and right lead .",
    "it just leaves a static sc pair potential , which is given by @xmath22 , in the dot .",
    "the pair potential appears because a sc proximity from the left lead is allowed even in the large gap limit , while the quasi - particle tunneling into the left lead is prohibited .",
    "this situation is described by a single - channel anderson model with an extra sc pair potential @xmath23 in the impurity site .",
