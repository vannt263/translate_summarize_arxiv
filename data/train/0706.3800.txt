    "obtaining some physically interesting piece of information on a spectrum of a differential operator is generically a difficult problem . for systems in low dimension ,",
    "say one or two , though numerical approaches can usually compute the spectrum to a high precision , very few is usually known when demanding the standard criterions of rigour of mathematical physics .",
    "the aim of the present article is to propose a method for finding gaps in the spectrum of a differential operator .",
    "we will mainly focus on the stationary one - dimensional non - magnetic schrdinger equation with a smooth potential  @xmath1 defined on the whole real axis , @xmath2 but it can be easily understood that our ideas , which will be explained in the first part of this article  (   [ sec : guideline ] ) , can be extended to a wider family of ordinary differential equations . for the sake of definiteness , in the second part  (   [ sec : quarticoscillator ] ) we will illustrate more concretely our method on the quartic oscillator   where the numerical `` exact '' spectrum will serve us as a touchstone .",
    "we will show that we are able to obtain gaps in the energy spectrum , _ i.e. _  intervals where there is no eigenenergy , with purely algebraic manipulations involving no integrals .",
    "an algorithm is explicitly constructed in the case of the quartic oscillator  but it remains robust under any kind of smooth perturbations  and provides more and more non - trivial gaps .",
    "as far as we know , in the huge mathematical physics literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * for instance and their references ) on the quartic oscillator no such gaps have been found .",
    "we will present strong evidence that , for still unknown reasons , this algorithm allows to resolve all the eigenenergies with a surprising precision even though , remaining stuck to the simplest means , we are far from having exhausted all the possibilities that our method offers .",
    "actually , some very subtle information on the spectrum can be gained since we can find a gap in between the tunnelling doublets , _",
    "i.e. _  when the energies are below the height of the intermediate barrier in a double - well configuration .",
    "the key idea of our method is to construct , for a given integer  @xmath3 , a real function  @xmath4 from a possible real square - integrable solution  @xmath5 of   with energy  @xmath6 ( the prime stands for the derivative  @xmath7 ) such that @xmath8 the real function  @xmath9 of both the spatial coordinate  @xmath10 and the energy  @xmath6 is @xmath5__-independent _ _ and is constructed from the potential  @xmath11 and its derivatives .",
    "an example of  @xmath12 is given by equation   below and some @xmath9 s are given by  ( [ eq : f1 ]  [ eq : f4 ] ) .",
    "( i ) is the cornerstone of our method and , before justifying how it can be obtained ( we will see that condition  ( ii ) is not so restrictive ) , let us first explain how gaps in the spectrum may be obtained .    when the conditions  ( i ) and ( ii ) are simultaneously fulfilled , an immediate consequence is that the integral  @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "this implies that , if @xmath6 is truly an eigenenergy , the function @xmath14 should change its sign .",
    "if  @xmath15 is even , we obtain a @xmath5-independent condition : _ for any fixed energy @xmath16 must change its sign on the real axis_. we will see that for such a one - dimensional problem , and for a given  @xmath15 , we still can choose  @xmath9 in a wide continuous set of smooth functions on the real axis . a forbidden value of  @xmath6 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath6 can not be an eigenenergy ) is obtained if we are able to construct a  @xmath9 that remains positive on the whole @xmath10-axis .",
    "once this property is achieved , it remains stable under small perturbations within the set of  @xmath9 s , and we obtain a whole interval where no eigenenergy can exist .",
    "when  @xmath15 is odd , _ a priori _ some non - trivial information can be extracted for the ground state only , if there is any .",
    "indeed , it is known that its wavefunction can be chosen positive for any schrdinger equation of the form   ( see for instance ( * ? ? ? * xiii.12 ) ) whereas all the excited eigenfunctions do change their sign .",
    "no gap can be found but one can use this strategy to find upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy even in a multidimensional situation . the differential method presented in @xcite corresponds to  @xmath17 .      in order to obtain condition  ( i ) ,",
    "let us start with  @xmath18 being a homogeneous polynomial of degree  @xmath15 with respect to its first two variables  @xmath19 : @xmath20 the smooth functions @xmath21 will be constructed in order to get condition  ( i ) : equation   allows us to eliminate  @xmath22 from the total derivative of  @xmath12 and then , the systematic cancellation of the coefficients of @xmath23 for  @xmath24 leads to the relations @xmath25 ( to get a unified expression , we define  @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 the recurrence relation   uniquely determines all the @xmath28 s and @xmath9 from  @xmath29 , which remains a free smooth function .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath30 the only condition on  @xmath29 is that it must not increase too rapidly when  @xmath31 in order to get condition  ( ii ) . from the standard semiclassical analysis ( * ? ? ? * for instance chap .",
    "vi ) , we know that if a bound state of  @xmath11 exists , its wavefunction decreases exponentially as  @xmath32 when  @xmath31 ; therefore the ansatz   will vanish at infinity as soon as @xmath33 becomes negligible compared to  @xmath34 .",
    "the condition @xmath35 is sufficient and not too demanding",
    ".    we do not loose generality with the form  .",
    "in fact any smooth function @xmath36 will inevitably lead to the hierarchy of functions  @xmath37 . to understand this , consider one monomial @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a function of @xmath10 , in the taylor expansion of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath19 once @xmath22 has been substituted by  @xmath41 .",
    "this monomial can be written as @xmath42\\nonumber \\\\                           & + \\frac{1}{m+1}\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}}{{\\mathrm{d}}x}\\left(c\\,(\\varphi')^{n-1}\\varphi^{m+1}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using this type of identity an adequate number of times we can systematically absorb all the powers of @xmath43 in a total derivative while keeping the homogeneity in  @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure can be pursued until we obtain  @xmath38 of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are smooth functions .",
    "a redefinition of  @xmath47 for each monomial of degree  @xmath48 leads to condition  ( i ) . rather than the starting point",
    ", we could have started from  @xmath49 and , working modulo a total derivative , repetitions of procedure   would have led to condition  ( i ) . for small  @xmath15",
    ", it can been checked that the @xmath9 thus obtained are also given by  ( [ eq : f1 ]  [ eq : f4 ] ) .",
    "to illustrate the efficiency of our approach , in this section we will consider a quartic potential , which can always be reduced in appropriate units to @xmath50 for  @xmath51 real .",
    "the associated energy spectrum is purely discrete and bounded from below by the minimum @xmath52 .",
    "the energies can been computed numerically without any difficulty by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the standard basis of the eigenstates of an harmonic oscillator .",
    "they are given by the continuous black lines in figure  [ fig : gapsm ] .",
    "for large positive  @xmath51 , the bottom of the spectrum  @xmath53 tends to the harmonic spectrum  @xmath54 . for @xmath55",
    ", we get a double - well configuration whre the central barrier reaches its maximum at  0 . when @xmath51 decreases from  @xmath56 , we observe the pairing of the energies @xmath57 into doublets that characterize tunnelling from one well to the other . for  @xmath58 the two first states  @xmath59 and  @xmath60",
    "are both negative , therefore below the energetic barrier , and  @xmath61 represents the tunnelling oscillation period ( recall that we are working in units where  @xmath62 ) of a state initially localised in one well and constructed from a linear combination of the symmetric / antisymmetric eigenstates associated with  @xmath59 and  @xmath60 respectively . as  @xmath63 increases , a standard semiclassical analysis shows that @xmath64 behaves like  @xmath65 for large  @xmath63 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , for instance ) .",
    "this exponentially small splitting is a highly non - trivial piece of spectral information to obtain by approximate methods .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that for a given positive or negative  @xmath51 , we actually can exhibit a gap between  @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    for simplicity , and in order to keep the computation tractable with elementary algebraic manipulations",
    ", we will work with  @xmath66 and take @xmath29 of the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is real ( not necessarily positive , see  ) and @xmath69 is a real polynomial in  @xmath10 ( to lighten the notations we leave the @xmath6-dependence implicit .",
    "note that @xmath69 may depend on  @xmath68 as well ) .",
    "condition   is largely satisfied . from expression",
    ", we have  @xmath70 where  @xmath71 is the polynomial @xmath72 that must change its sign if  @xmath6 is an eigenenergy . to find a forbidden value for the energy we construct an even  @xmath71 and therefore start from an odd  @xmath69 : @xmath73 then @xmath74 where the coefficients  @xmath75 are expressed in terms of the  @xmath76 via the recurrence relation @xmath77 for @xmath78 ( we define  @xmath79 for @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) . the simplest way to control",
    "the sign of  @xmath71 is to reduce it to a polynomial of degree two in @xmath82 : @xmath83 where  @xmath84 .",
    "this can be done if we choose the  @xmath85 s in order to cancel all the @xmath86 for @xmath87 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "equations   determine uniquely all the @xmath85 s up to a common factor  @xmath89 than can be taken to one without loss of generality : @xmath90 is a polynomial in  @xmath91 of degree at most  @xmath92 . from equation   written for @xmath93 , the condition @xmath94 imposes an algebraic relation of degree at most  @xmath95 between  @xmath6 and  @xmath68 that implicitly defines  @xmath68 as a function of  @xmath6 ( several branches are possible in general ) . after eliminating  @xmath68",
    ", the discriminant of  @xmath96 appears as a function  @xmath97 of  @xmath6 and  @xmath51 only . for a given  @xmath51 , all the values of  @xmath6 where  @xmath98 are forbidden .",
