    "in the past decade , the advent of magnetic field control of interatomic interactions near a feshbach resonance has rapidly sparked both experimental capabilities and theoretical understanding in the field of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "using @xmath0-wave feshbach resonances in an atomic fermi gas with two different spin states @xcite , fundamental problems such as the crossover between bose - einstein condensation and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer - type superfluidity @xcite have become accessible experimentally , allowing tests of fundamental theories and studies of novel phenomena ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "recently , the observation of @xmath1-wave feshbach resonances in spin - polarized fermi gases @xcite instigated theoretical studies that predicted a variety of novel many - body phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent experimental observation of @xmath1-wave molecules @xcite in a @xmath2k fermi gas has provided a starting point for further investigations of novel many - body phenomena in the strongly interacting regime @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of the theoretical predictions will hinge on the lifetime and stability of @xmath1-wave molecules , since , e.g. , the long lifetime predicted @xcite and found @xcite for @xmath0-wave molecules was one of the key ingredients that facilitated the observation of fermionic superfluid behavior in dilute gases . in ref .",
    "@xcite , though , it was found that @xmath1-wave molecules are short - lived which limits the possible types of states that can be created for @xmath1-wave molecular condensates .    in this paper , we explore the physics of three - body collisions involving both @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave molecules with the goal of understanding what determines their different levels of stability . for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave cases ,",
    "the dominant contribution to the inelastic atom - molecule rate coefficient at sufficiently low collision energies has @xmath0-wave character and therefore does not vanish , even at zero temperature .",
    "such processes thus play an important role for atom - molecule mixtures near a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "our results indicate that many of the characteristics of @xmath1-wave @xmath2k@xmath3 molecules are likely to be shared by other atomic species .",
    "this expectation is based on the universal nature of our results that are discussed below .",
    "we have also found that , near a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance , @xmath0-wave atom - molecule collisions are likely to be insensitive to the presence of the feshbach resonance , in contrast to the @xmath0-wave case .",
    "however , our results indicate that while inelastic @xmath1-wave atom - molecule collisions are suppressed , elastic @xmath1-wave atom - molecule collisions are enhanced near a @xmath1-wave resonance .",
    "we then briefly discuss the three - body parameters that might be important for understanding many - body aspects in degenerate fermi gases with resonant @xmath1-wave interactions .",
    "the primary goal of the present study is to discuss calculations carried out for both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave molecules that highlight the main mechanisms that cause their lifetimes to be so different .",
    "near a two - body feshbach resonance , the physics that determines the collisional properties of @xmath0-wave molecules is closely related to what has been called efimov physics @xcite .",
    "efimov physics occurs when the two - body @xmath0-wave scattering length , @xmath4 with @xmath5 the phase shift and @xmath6 the wave number , is abnormally large compared to the characteristic range @xmath7 of the interatomic interactions . for @xmath0-wave molecules composed of fermions in different spin states , say @xmath8 , efimov physics predicts a universal repulsive effective interaction for @xmath9 collisions which is responsible for the @xmath10 suppression of atomic and molecular losses @xcite . for @xmath9 collisions , efimov physics also predicts that the atom - molecule scattering length should be @xmath11 @xcite , which ensures a strong atom - molecule interaction in the many - body quantum gas , and which provides efficient evaporative cooling near a feshbach resonance .",
    "a positive @xmath12 can also protect the atom - molecule mixture against collapse .",
    "however , as has been shown experimentally @xcite , near a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance the situation differs strikingly and @xmath1-wave molecules composed of spin - polarized fermions in a single internal substate , say @xmath13 , tend to have short lifetimes .",
    "only recently has atom - molecule scattering for large @xmath1-wave scattering lengths , @xmath14 , been studied @xcite .",
    "( note that the @xmath1-wave scattering is sometimes characterized equivalently by the `` @xmath1-wave scattering volume '' @xmath15 @xcite . )",
    "three - body recombination of spin - stretched fermions received earlier attention @xcite where it was shown that recombination rate could be significant near a @xmath1-wave resonance despite the fermi statistics suppression .",
    "more recently , the recombination channel in the @xmath16 system was studied using a zero - range @xmath1-wave pseudopotential interaction @xcite . there , the existence of a large number of weakly bound three - body states analogous to the efimov states for bosons @xcite was proposed . in our calculations",
    ", we found similar three - body states at the simplest level of approximation of the hyperspherical adiabatic representation .",
    "they disappear , however , once nonadiabatic effects are included , which leads us to speculate that these nonadiabatic corrections might also eliminate the three - body states found in ref .",
    "moreover , it is not clear whether the energy dependence neglected in their @xmath1-wave pseudopotentials @xcite affects the universality of the results predicted in ref .",
    "our results presented here do not suffer from such limitations because our two - body finite range model potential intrinsically includes such corrections .",
    "in this paper we focus on atom - molecule scattering properties and find that both elastic and inelastic @xmath0-wave @xmath17 processes are largely and surprisingly insensitive to variations of @xmath18 and potentially explain the loss rates observed in ref .",
    "this result agrees with the qualitative arguments in ref .",
    "we trace the insensivity of the atom - molecule losses to the weakly attractive effective atom - molecule interaction and to the fact that the size of a @xmath1-wave molecule is mainly determined by @xmath7 and therefore does not change as @xmath19 varies , in contrast to @xmath0-wave molecules whose size is directly related to @xmath20 .",
    "our results , therefore , indicate that the insensitivity to variations of @xmath19 of both elastic and inelastic @xmath17 processes is likely to be a universal property of @xmath1-wave molecules . based on these results we also speculate",
    "on which few - body parameters are important for many - body theories for spin - polarized fermi gases .",
    "we have extracted the three - body elastic and inelastic collisional properties of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave molecules from numerically converged solutions of the three - body schrdinger equation carried out in the adiabatic hyperspherical representation @xcite , using model finite - range two - body interactions .",
    "this representation offers a simple , unifying picture from which we can quantitatively determine and then qualitatively interpret the origin of the significantly different collisional properties of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave molecules .      in our calculations",
    "we have used the two - body model interaction @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the interatomic separation .",
    "we have taken @xmath7 to be the van der waals length @xcite for @xmath2k atoms , @xmath32  a.u . , and @xmath24 to be the @xmath2k atomic mass .",
    "we varied @xmath20 and @xmath19 by changing the potential depth @xmath33 around the vicinity of the value that produces a weakly bound state of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave character , respectively .",
    "for @xmath34 systems we adjusted @xmath33 to produce two deeply bound @xmath8 molecules ( one @xmath0-wave and one @xmath1-wave ) in addition to the weakly bound @xmath0-wave molecule , and we neglected @xmath13 interactions . for @xmath16 systems , we adjusted @xmath33 to produce one deeply bound @xmath1-wave molecule and one weakly - bound @xmath1-wave molecule . in a more realistic model for @xmath1-wave interactions near a feshbach resonance",
    ", however , one needs to consider the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction which treats the resonance in terms of its angular momentum projection @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "our model , which does not include dipole - dipole interactions , is applicable to @xmath35 and @xmath37 resonances individually and does not include coupling between @xmath35 and @xmath37 molecules .",
    "@xmath34 fermionic systems with @xmath0-wave resonant interaction and for ( b ) @xmath38 @xmath16 spin - polarized fermionic systems with @xmath1-wave resonant interactions . as is discussed in the text , these potentials illustrate the main mechanisms that produce different collisional behaviors of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave molecules presented here.,width=326 ]    at ultracold energies , the dominant contribution for both @xmath39 and @xmath40 collisions comes from the relative @xmath0-wave , which implies that the dominant three - body symmetry for @xmath34 is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the total orbital angular momentum and @xmath43 is the total parity ) while for @xmath16 it is @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ potentials ] shows typical effective potentials @xmath44 for @xmath34 [ fig .",
    "[ potentials](a ) ] and @xmath16 systems [ fig .",
    "[ potentials](b ) ] obtained for @xmath45 and @xmath46  a.u .",
    ", respectively . for these scattering lengths , the binding energy for @xmath0-wave molecules , @xmath47 , and @xmath1-wave molecules , @xmath48 @xcite ,",
    "are comparable , making it easier to contrast the two cases .    in fig .",
    "[ potentials ] the series of effective potentials that converge to zero as @xmath49 are three - body continuum channels representing collisions between three free atoms .",

    "[ potentials](b ) converging to the @xmath1-wave @xmath13 molecule energy at large @xmath21 due the possible @xmath50 and @xmath51 atom - molecule relative angular momenta allowed for @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ potentials ] we also sketch the elastic and inelastic pathways that are of interest here .    from the figure",
    ", we notice a fundamental difference between the initial @xmath9 and @xmath17 collision channels . for @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "the effective potential is repulsive ( proportional to @xmath52 @xcite ) in the range @xmath53 , while the @xmath50 effective potential for @xmath17 collisions is attractive in the analogous range @xmath54 [ the quantity @xmath55 can be understood from the length scale defined by the molecular binding energy @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of a repulsive barrier for @xmath9 collisions whose range scales with @xmath57 suggests that @xmath12 should be proportional to @xmath20 , in analogy to scattering from a hard sphere of radius @xmath20 .",
    "the inelastic processes for this case , however , should be suppressed as @xmath20 increases , since it becomes increasingly difficult for the system to tunnel to the region @xmath58 where the coupling to the deeper molecular states lies [ we have verified this statement from our calculations of the nonadiabatic couplings in eq .",
    "( [ schreq ] ) ] .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that the suppression of the inelastic losses scale with @xmath59 as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is related with the strength of the repulsive potential barrier in the range @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the presence of an attractive potential for @xmath17 collisions instead of a repulsive potential allows the atom and molecule to approach each other closely without any suppression of the inelastic transition probability .",
    "in addition , the absence of a repulsive barrier does not allow us to make an analogy to scattering from a hard sphere , which implies that @xmath12 is not necessarily a simple function proportional to @xmath19 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been speculated that there is one trimer state in this attractive potential that can cause resonant enhancement of the elastic and inelastic rates when varying @xmath19 . as we show below , in our calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ rates ] ) we do observe resonant effects for elastic and inelastic @xmath17 collisions , and we do associate them with the formation of a trimer state as predicted in refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "however , we believe such trimer states are likely to be non - universal in the sense that their energy as a function of @xmath19 depends on the short - range physics not fully represented by the two - body parameters in ref .",
    "therefore , the resonant peaks in the elastic and inelastic rates will likely depend on a purely three - body non - universal parameter , similar to the problem with identical bosons where all three - body observables depend on a three - body parameter representing the short - range physics @xcite .",
    "we have verified the qualitative behavior described above for the elastic and inelastic rates by solving the schrdinger equation ( [ schreq ] ) in coupled hyperradial form using an @xmath21-matrix approach @xcite .",
    "we define the atom - molecule scattering length in terms of the real part of the complex phase - shift obtained from the @xmath62-matrix element [ @xmath63 associated with the atom - molecule channel , @xmath64}{k_{ad } } ,   \\label{aad}\\ ] ] with @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the binding energy of the weakly bound dimer . for inelastic collisions ,",
    "we define the vibrational relaxation rate @xmath68 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the initial collision channel ( atom+weakly bound molecule ) ; and @xmath71 , all possible final collision channels ( atom+deeply bound molecule ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath12 and @xmath68 for values of @xmath20 and @xmath19 ranging from @xmath72  a.u . ) up to approximately @xmath73 at a collision energy of 1  nk , in order to satisfy the @xmath74 limit in eq .",

    "we have obtained both @xmath12 and @xmath68 in the @xmath75 regime that verifies the @xmath76 universal prediction  @xcite and reproduces the strong @xmath77 suppression of the inelastic rate  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is rather favorable for the realization of cold atom - molecule mixtures since it combines strong elastic rates with suppression of atomic and molecular losses .     and ( b ) vibrational relaxation rate @xmath68 for @xmath41 @xmath9 ( dash - circle line ) and @xmath38 @xmath17 ( solid - circle line ) collisions as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "while for @xmath9 collisions @xmath12 and @xmath68 show a strong dependence on @xmath20 , for @xmath17 they are essentially insensitive to variations of @xmath19.,width=312 ]    on the other hand , @xmath17 elastic and inelastic processes involving @xmath1-wave molecules are quite different . for smaller values of @xmath19 , we observe a strong variation of both @xmath12 and @xmath68 [ see fig .",
    "[ rates ] ] due to the presence of a trimer state @xcite that becomes unbound as @xmath19 increases . as we mentioned before",
    ", we do not expect the energy of such a trimer state , nor the value of @xmath18 at which it appears , to be universal , since they both depend on the short - range physics .",
    "consequently , the resonance position in fig .  [ rates ] can change , and eventually disappear , for different choices of the two - body interaction .",
    "however , near a @xmath1-wave two - body feshbach resonance , i.e. , in the regime @xmath78 , our results for @xmath12 and @xmath68 are insensitive to variations of @xmath19 .",
    "we rationalize this result by recognizing that even though @xmath18 changes substantially , the size of the weakly - bound @xmath1-wave molecule is practically unchanged .",
    "we expect that this insensitivity of @xmath12 and @xmath68 to variations of @xmath19 is universal but that their actual values will not be universal since the system must access small @xmath21 where details of the two - body interactions become important .",
    "further , it can be demonstrated by a simple wkb analysis @xcite that the constant character of @xmath68 as a function of @xmath19 is ensured provided the effective potential falls off faster than @xmath52 . from our numerical calculations , for instance , we found that @xmath79 in the regime @xmath80 , in contrast to the @xmath81 result of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the consequences of the three - body physics discussed above for the lifetime and stability of spin - polarized fermionic mixtures of atoms and molecules are very different from the scenario found for a gas of fermions in two different spin states .",
    "the constant value of @xmath12 for @xmath80 means that atom - molecule collisions will not help much for evaporative cooling , unless @xmath12 is unnaturally large .",
    "more importantly , the insensitivity of @xmath68 to @xmath19 implies that the molecular lifetimes do not change as we approach the point of divergence of @xmath19 , in contrast to @xmath0-wave molecules whose lifetime increases near a zero - energy fano - feshbach resonance .",
    "these results are in agreement with recent experimental data for an atom - molecule gas mixture of @xmath2k atoms @xcite , where it was found that the lifetimes of both @xmath35 and @xmath37 molecules do not depend on the magnetic field and therefore on @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was found that the molecules were shorter - lived than one would expect based on the magnetic field independent _",
    "two_-body dipolar relaxation rates .",
    "more recently @xcite , loss rates substantially below those found in @xcite were observed after the atoms had been removed from the trap , leaving only molecules .",
    "therefore , since both dipolar relaxation and atom - molecule collisions yield molecular losses independent of the magnetic - field , we believe that the shorter molecular lifetimes were due to vibrational relaxation as we have calculated here .",
    "our prediction of approximately constant atom - molecule losses also demonstrates that even when atoms are prepared in their lowest hyperfine state , and therefore dipolar relaxation is energetically forbidden , a magnetic field independent molecular lifetime is likely to be found for other atomic species , but now limited by three - body loss processes . in the absence of atoms ,",
    "molecule - molecule elastic and inelastic processes should also be important .",
    "we speculate that these are also likely to be insensitive to variations of @xmath19 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , based on the fact that the size of a @xmath1-wave molecule does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 does not seem to depend on @xmath18 raises the question whether @xmath12 will be the important parameter for theories attempting to describe many - body aspects of atom - molecule mixtures in spin - polarized fermi gases .",
    "a constant value of @xmath12 across a feshbach resonance essentially means that the atom - molecule interaction does not `` feel '' the presence of the @xmath1-wave resonance . from this perspective , the atom - molecule interaction is not controllable , and the atom - molecule mixture can not be claimed to be strongly interacting near the resonance . for this reason",
    ", we have also performed some preliminary calculations to explore @xmath1-wave atom - molecule collisions . for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ( which are all the symmetries that allow @xmath1-wave collisions between an atom and a @xmath1-wave molecule )",
    ", we have found that the three - body effective potentials are now repulsive in the range @xmath85 , instead of attractive as found for @xmath86 .",
    "the presence of such a repulsive barrier suppresses inelastic @xmath1-wave atom - molecule collisions @xcite , making these collisions less important than @xmath0-wave collisions in determining the lifetime of @xmath1-wave molecules . on the other hand",
    ", the repulsive barrier indicates that the @xmath1-wave atom - molecule scattering length , @xmath87 , should be proportional to @xmath55 , again in analogy to scattering from a hard - sphere .",
    "therefore , it is likely that @xmath87 will be an important parameter for many - body theories of atom - molecule mixtures near a @xmath1-wave resonance , since @xmath87 is a controllable parameter .",
    "experimentally , however , @xmath1-wave atom - molecule interactions will be comparably difficult to control as @xmath1-wave atom - atom interactions because of the suppression of the energy dependent elastic cross - sections .",
    "certainly , it will be necessary to explore in depth the importance of @xmath87 , but this discussion is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have determined the atom - molecule scattering length , @xmath12 , and vibrational relaxation rate , @xmath68 , for collisions involving @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave molecules of fermionic atoms as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath19 which can be controlled with two - body feshbach resonances .",
    "we have determined @xmath12 and @xmath68 for @xmath0-wave molecules of fermionic atoms in different spin states , verifying previously derived results .",
    "we could thus identify the mechanisms that control the collisional properties of @xmath1-wave molecules . for spin - polarized systems ,",
    "we have found that both @xmath12 and @xmath68 are insensitive to variations of the two - body @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath19 for @xmath80 , consistent with the recent experimental data in ref .",
    "we expect the results for @xmath12 and @xmath68 to be universal with respect to their insensitivity to variations of @xmath19 but their values can change for different atomic species .",
    "we also speculated that , due to the constant character of @xmath12 , the relevant parameter for many - body theories for a spin - polarized mixture of atoms and molecules is likely to be associated with @xmath1-wave collisions between a fermionic atom and a @xmath1-wave molecule .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that the @xmath1-wave scattering length for such collisions , @xmath88 , is likely to be proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "note that the very recent preprint by jona - lasinio _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite argues that the threshold exponent for three - body recombination of spin - polarized fermions should be proportional to @xmath89 at large @xmath1-wave scattering lengths .",
