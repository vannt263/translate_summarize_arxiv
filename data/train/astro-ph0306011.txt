    "the ever - tightening network of constraints from cmb and non - cmb observations favors a concordant @xmath3 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model that is commonly accepted as the standard cosmological model . as long as the systematic errors associated with cmb observations are small",
    ", the cmb power spectrum can play an increasingly large role in establishing and refining this model .",
    "thus , it is crucial to check the cmb data for possible systematic errors in as many ways as possible .",
    "systematic errors and selection effects are notoriously difficult to identify and quantify . calibration and/or beam uncertainties dominate cmb measurements and there may be lower level systematic errors of which we are not aware .",
    "individual experimental groups have developed various ways to check their cmb observations for systematic effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the use of multiple calibration sources , multiple frequency channels and extensive beam calibrating observations .",
    "internal consistency is the primary concern of these checks .",
    "testing for consistency with other cmb observations is another important way to identify possible systematic errors .",
    "when the areas of the sky observed overlap , this can be done by comparing cmb temperature maps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when similar angular scales are being observed one can compare power spectra ( e.g. sievers et al . 2002 ) . and",
    ", for example , check for frequency - dependent discrepancies ( odman 2003 ) .    to calibrate a data set",
    ", one needs a trusted external calibrator . in this work",
    "we take the point of view that the @xmath3cdm concordance model , that has emerged over the past 5 years due to its compatibility with dozens of observations with independent systematic errors , can be used as a calibrator .",
    "these independent observations are the hubble key project constraint on @xmath4 ( freedman et al 2001 ) , the @xmath5 constraints from observations of type ia supernovae ( riess et al . 1998 , perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , big bang nucleosynthesis constraints on the baryon content ( burles et al .",
    "2001 ) , and large scale structure constraints on the amplitude @xmath6 and shape of the matter power spectrum from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( peacock et al .",
    "recent joint likelihood analyses of this data and the cmb ( as summarized in griffiths & lineweaver 2003 ) suggest the observationally concordant cosmology ; @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 taken to be zero .",
    "our analysis is based on the assumption that the combined cosmological observations used to determine the concordance model are giving us a more accurate estimate of cosmological parameters , and therefore of the true @xmath16 spectrum , than is given by the cmb data alone . under this assumption , the residuals of the individual observed cmb band powers and the concordance @xmath3cdm model become tools to identify a variety of systematic errors .",
    "we look for any linear trends that may identify systematic effects that are correlated with the details of the observations .    a prerequisite for the extraction of useful estimates for cosmological parameters from the combined cmb data",
    "set is the mutual consistency of the observational data points .",
    "however , for the sake of a clean interpretational story , systematic errors in a data set are sometimes ignored or explained away .",
    "david wilkinson was fond of explicitly showing the systematic errors , or warts as he called them , in his data . in a similar spirit",
    "we went looking for warts in the pre - wmap data .",
    "we have performed linear fits on the residual data with respect to angular size ( @xmath2 ) , galactic latitude , frequency , frequency channels , frequency bandwidth , galactic longitude , instrument type , platform and altitude , pointing uncertainty and area of sky observed ( griffiths & lineweaver 2003 ) . for the majority ,",
    "we find little or no evidence for any trend .",
    "the most significant linear trend observable in the residuals is with respect to the absolute galactic latitude @xmath17 of the observations .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "3 shows a linear trend that is inconsistent at more than 95% confidence with a zero gradient line through the residuals .",
    "this trend is not eliminated by the removal of any one experiment and may be indicative of a source of galactic emission that has not been appropriately treated .",
    "the best - fit line to the data suggests that cmb observations made closer to the galactic plane may be over - estimated by approximately 2% .",
    "the weighted average of points with @xmath18 is @xmath19 , while it is @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "if this is due to galactic contamination , then the normalization q@xmath22 may have to be reduced @xmath23 or by @xmath24 from @xmath25k to @xmath26k .",
    "a more detailed analysis of galactic dust and synchrotron maps may reveal the source of this trend .    at the level of @xmath0 to @xmath1",
    "we find trends in the residuals with respect to @xmath2 ( angular size ) .",
    "figure  [ bin_clplotcol ] indicates that the 6 bins between @xmath27 prefer a lower normalization .",
    "this could be due to underestimates of beam sizes or pointing uncertainties or unidentified beam smearing effects at high @xmath2 for small beams .",
    "although we see no significant evidence for trends associated with beam size or pointing uncertainty , limiting the pointing uncertainty analysis to the 5 points with the largest uncertainties yields a trend , suggesting that the largest pointing uncertainties may have been underestimated .    to analyze various experiments , knowledge of the calibration uncertainty of the measurements",
    "is necessary .",
    "independent observations that calibrate off the same source will have calibration uncertainties that are correlated at some level and therefore a fraction of their freedom to shift upward or downward will be shared . in this analysis",
    "we have marginalized over the calibration uncertainties associated with the observations , treating them as independent free parameters with gaussian distributions about their nominal values .    over the past 10 years",
    ", successive independent and semi - independent data sets have extended the angular scale , calibration precision and freedom from galactic contamination of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "the wmap measurements ( bennett et al . 2003 ) are a milestone in this direction .",
    "more wmap data and the results of other cmb experiments are eagerly awaited .",
    "each cmb measurement contains useful cosmological information and no data set is immune to contamination .",
    "it is therefore important to compare data sets and check for systematics .",
    "our results indicate that the pre - wmap data set is consistent with the concordant model although the model seems to need slight modifications around the scale of the first peak and at high @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "we find no significant evidence for inter - experiment inconsistencies other than an indication of low - level galactic contamination ( fig .",
    "we are now extending our analysis to include the wmap data .",
