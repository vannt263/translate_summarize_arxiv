    "the system in thermal equilibrium can be described by a temperature - dependent one - body green s function @xmath2 on the imaginary axis , where @xmath3 are matsubara frequencies , @xmath4 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the exact expectation values of any one - body operator can be evaluated using the explicitly temperature - dependent density matrix @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the system hamiltonian , particle number operator , and chemical potential , respectively .    in this paper , we discuss an iterative perturbative 2nd - order approximation , gf2 ,  @xcite yielding an approximate temperature - dependent density matrix from the 2nd - order green s function . in such method , the perturbation is not only a function of interactions , but also temperature .",
    "therefore , gf2 is exact in the limit of infinite temperature as well as vanishing perturbation .",
    "recently , numerous papers appeared that investigate different variants of temperature - dependent perturbation theories ,  @xcite since the inclusion of temperature , while not very relevant in molecules , is crucial in materials studies .",
    "the iterative temperature - dependent green s function methods such as gf2 are conserving approximations ,  @xcite and the observables obtained from the green s function agree with the macroscopic conservation laws , _",
    "e.g. _ , conservation of particle number , momentum , angular momentum , and energy .",
    "in such approximations , the self - energy can be expressed as a functional derivative of a certain functional with respect to the green s function .",
    "this is only attained if the green s function method is self - consistent .",
    "@xcite if the green s function method is not self - consistent , the particle number can be incorrect and the virial theorem does not need to be preserved .",
    "most importantly , in the conserving approximations at self - consistency different methods for calculating the total energy via the green s function give the same result .",
    "@xcite    another advantage of self - consistency is due to effective inclusion of higher - order diagrams , which are not explicitly present in the 2nd - order self - energy approximation , via iterative renormalization of the free propagator lines . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we discuss how the iterations ( and implicit inclusion of higher - order diagrams ) influence the phase diagram and convergence of gf2 for metallic systems .",

    ", we aim to simultaneously take advantage of the following useful representations of the green s function and self - energy .",
    "first , in a fashion similar to refs .  , we are exploiting a convenient denominator - free form of the 2nd - order self - energy in the imaginary - time domain .",
    "then , since the 2nd - order self - energy expression can be evaluated using atomic orbitals , we take advantage of the local character of the self - energy in this basis .",

    "the evaluation of various quantities such as overlap , density and fock matrices or green s functions is made feasible by exploiting translational symmetry and imposing periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",

    "[ gf2_mol ] , the evaluation of the formally 6-fold contractions over the basis functions is facilitated by breaking it down into several consecutive transformations .",

    "in addition , screening the two - electron integrals and discarding negligible intermediate contractions can reduce the computation cost even further .    the self - energy expression ( eq .",
    "[ gf2_pbc_real ] ) appears as a product of quantities that decay with the increase of the intercell distance .",
    "such structure of @xmath50 prompts a higher decay rate of the self - energy than that of the individual @xmath52 and @xmath53 components as the distance between the cells increases .",

    "( ii ) large green s function limit*. we maximize the green s function elements in the expression ( [ term ] ) by choosing the on - site elements : @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , the expression  ( [ term ] ) reduces to @xmath69 if we further maximize this expression by setting @xmath70 to its largest value @xmath71 , we obtain @xmath72 the integral @xmath73 decays fast enough to prevail over a possibly substantial product of green s functions .",
    "specifically , for @xmath62    the largest product of the green s functions corresponds to @xmath74 at @xmath75 , and the integral @xmath76 drops to the order of @xmath63 for @xmath16 being 5 cells apart from the reference one .",
    "we observe that even the largest possible elements of @xmath52 or @xmath53 are contracted to facilitate a rapid decay of @xmath77 with respect to the distance between cells @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",

    "<S> despite recent advances , systematic quantitative treatment of the electron correlation problem in extended systems remains a formidable task . </S>",
    "<S> systematically improvable green s function methods capable of quantitatively describing weak and at least qualitatively strong correlations appear promising candidates for computational treatment of periodic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we present a periodic implementation of temperature - dependent self - consistent 2nd - order green s function method ( gf2 ) , where the self - energy is evaluated in the basis of atomic orbitals . evaluating the real - space self - energy in atomic orbitals and solving the dyson equation in @xmath0-space are the key components of a computationally feasible algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this technique to the 1d hydrogen lattice  a prototypical crystalline system with a realistic hamiltonian . by analyzing the behavior of the spectral functions , natural occupations , and self - energies , </S>",
    "<S> we claim that gf2 is able to recover metallic , band insulating , and at least qualitatively mott regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the iterative nature of gf2 is essential to the emergence of the metallic and mott phases . </S>"
