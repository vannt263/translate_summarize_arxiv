    "after this work was completed we learnt about very recent related works on unistochastic matrices of berkolaiko  @xcite and tanner  @xcite .",
    "for a real bistochastic matrix @xmath1 of size @xmath53 @xmath174 we want to find a unitary matrix @xmath2 , such that @xmath175 .",
    "we can manipulate with @xmath176 variable phases @xmath177 of the matrix @xmath2 @xmath178 the unitarity of @xmath2 requires that @xmath179 equations  ( [ ueqs ] ) for @xmath180 are fulfilled due to stochasticity of @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ beqs ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ ueqs ] ) for @xmath181 are complex conjugated of these for @xmath182 . transforming the system of equations  ( [ ueqs ] )",
    "@xmath183 we found that @xmath184 equations of the system are depending on the other ones , because the diagonal equations of the righthand side are equivalent to conditions for bistochasticity of @xmath1  the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ beqs ] ) .",
    "we subtracted the unity from @xmath53 since there is one common condition stemming from each of the sums in eq .",
    "( [ beqs ] ) , @xmath185 .",
    "the number of independent real equations in  ( [ ueqs ] ) equals thus @xmath186 .",
    "we introduce new variables @xmath187 , so the equations  ( [ ueqs ] ) are equivalent to @xmath188 since @xmath189 , so the @xmath186 equations  ( [ ueqs ] ) depend on @xmath186 real independent variables @xmath190 .",
    "these equations give the values of @xmath191 .",
    "for @xmath192 there exists only one phase @xmath193 equal to @xmath136 as shown by tanner  @xcite .",
    "this value does not depend on the bistochastic matrix @xmath194 .",
    "( [ leqs ] ) do not depend on @xmath195 and @xmath169 , so we may average over them , assuming the uniform distribution over the unit circle , @xmath196 for @xmath197 .",
    "this is equivalent to averaging of the matrix @xmath198 over diagonal unitary random matrices @xmath199 and @xmath200 , with a fixed matrix @xmath201 , fulfilling @xmath202 .",
    "the system of equations  ( [ ueqs ] ) is solvable only if @xmath203 which is the condition for the possibility of balance the maximal term in the sums  ( [ ueqs ] ) by the rest and the analog condition for the sums stemming from  ( [ veqs ] ) .",
    "this necessary condition for a bistochastic matrix to be unistochastic becomes sufficient in @xmath204 case .",
    "for @xmath192 all bistochastic matrices are orthostochastic ( and therefore also unistochastic ) .",
    "however for @xmath205 several examples of bistochastic matrices , which are not unistochastic , are known  @xcite , they do not satisfy the condition  ( [ ucreq ] ) .",
    "statistical properties of random unistochastic matrices are studied in  @xcite .",
    "the construction of quantum graphs presented in section  [ secgs ] hinge on the possibility of finding an unitary ( or orthogonal ) matrix corresponding to the bistochastic matrix obtained for a given dynamical system for an arbitrary markov subdivision of the original partition .",
    "rather then attempting the formulation of the most general theorem concerning the existence of such unistochastic matrices , we present here a construction for a particular case of the `` four legs map '' presented in fig .",
    "in other words we show that the all bistochastic matrices @xmath54 corresponding to this classical dynamical system are unistochastic .",
    "let us consider the following choice of a corresponding unitary matrix @xmath207 the bistochastic matrix for the two times finer subdivision reads @xmath208 using our knowledge of the unitarity of @xmath209 we want to find a unitary matrix @xmath210 , such that latexmath:[$b^{(8)}_{ij}=    @xmath209 with an appropriate shift .",
    "thus @xmath210 may read as follows @xmath212 note that the number of the non zero elements in @xmath210 is two times larger than the number of the non zero elements in @xmath209 . by replicating each row of the matrix @xmath209 @xmath57 times",
    "we obtain in the similar way unitary matrices of the size @xmath213 .",
    "the success of this construction is due to the fact that the nonzero elements of the first and fourth rows of @xmath209 are equal , which implies orthogonality of the following pairs of rows in @xmath210 : ( 2,3 ) , ( 2,5 ) , ( 4,7 ) and ( 6,7 ) .",
    "however this is not the only way of constructing the family of unitary matrices @xmath214 .",
    "for example we found another family @xmath215 originating from @xmath216 even though the procedure described above fails in this case .",
    "this fact allows us to hope that the class of classical 1d maps leading to quantum graphs ( fulfilling the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) ) is not trivial .",
