    "models that describe multi - channel nonadiabatic processes in explicitly time - dependent quantum systems are important for the theory of control and characterization of numerous mesoscopic and atomic systems @xcite .",
    "several exact results for explicitly driven two state systems , such as the landau - zener - stuekkelberg - majorana formula @xcite , have become widely used in practice . however , the physics of nonadiabatic transitions in _ multichannel _ explicitly driven systems is a much more complex topic .",
    "exactly solvable models can provide the needed intuition about this subject .",
    "they also can be used as a starting point for various approximation schemes and testing numerical algorithms and analytical methods .    a relatively large class of exactly solvable landau - zener - like models with multichannel interactions has been identified and explored in @xcite .",
    "these models correspond to quantum mechanical evolution of systems with matrix hamiltonian operators of the type @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constant @xmath5 matrices .",
    "one has to find the scattering @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 , in which the element @xmath7 is the amplitude of the diabatic state @xmath8 at @xmath9 , given that at @xmath10 ( or at @xmath11 ) the system was at the state @xmath12 . the related matrix @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , is called the matrix of transition probabilities .    in this article , we present a new exactly solvable system of the type and determine its matrix of transition probabilities .",
    "equation for the amplitudes , called @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , of this model is given by @xmath18 with constant parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will call @xmath22 the amplitude of the `` 0th level , '' @xmath23 the amplitude of the `` @xmath24th level , '' etc . ;",
    "parameters @xmath21 are called the coupling constants , and @xmath19 is called the slope of the @xmath25th diabatic energy level .     time - dependence of the eigenspectrum ( adiabatic energies ) of the hamiltonian with elements @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and zero otherwise ( @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ) . for any @xmath12 , all @xmath31 . ]",
    "this model corresponds to the case of a single linear diabatic energy level crossing a band of states whose diabatic energies ( diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix ) decay as @xmath32 with time ( ) . structurally , the model ( [ eq : sch1 ] , [ eq : sch2 ] ) is very similar to the celebrated demkov - osherov model @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds to the case of a single level crossing a band of parallel states .",
    "in fact , one can show that the demkov - osherov solution is recovered from our model in a specific limit : @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "when this condition is not satisfied , the band has a nonzero curvature near the avoided level crossings .",
    "hence , our solution makes a unique insight into the physics of nonadiabatic transitions in the case when a band has a non - zero curvature , as shown in .",
    "another interesting situation corresponds to the case when all @xmath20 are negative .",
    "our model then corresponds to the system with nonadiabatic transitions between a level that passes in the vicinity of a band but does not go through avoided level crossings ( figure  [ diab - av ] ) .",
    "we will discuss that not all transition probabilities among diabatic states are well defined in this system because states of the band become asymptotically degenerate at @xmath35 , so that transitions among them never saturate .",
    "therefore , our main focus will be on the probability of transition to the 0th level .",
