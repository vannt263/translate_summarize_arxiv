    "<S> we thererfore construct ( see in _ sm - ii&iii _ ) a simpler model which takes into account only the pair interactions between the nearest neighbors as springs on rods ; the results for the coupling coefficients are shown as colors in fig  [ fig : kappas ] . the symmetric ch stretch mode # 1 couples most efficiently with a pair of the asymmetric rotations # 6 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , asymmetric ch stretch mode # 2 couples strongly with a pair of non - equivalent phonons , i.e. , asymmetric rotation # 6 and cartwheel mode # 7 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling to the symmetric rotation mode # 11 is ineffective and the coefficients are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller . </S>",

    "<S> the anharmonic coupling coefficients described above allows for a theoretical extimation of @xmath85 . if @xmath81 , the estimate is @xmath96  s , which is about 7 times larger than the best fit value . however , as noted above , the double excitation of the reaction coordinate mode gives in this case a contribution to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting value of the coefficient @xmath71 is then @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath98 times larger than the fitted value @xmath99 . </S>",

    "<S> the latter , being a hindered rotation mode , may simplify the resulting molecule rotation .    to conclude , we show that the precursor for the acetylene rotation on cu(001 ) is the out - of - plane bend ( or asymmetric rotation ) mode @xmath102100  mev ( # 6 in table  [ tab : vibmodes ] ) . </S>",
