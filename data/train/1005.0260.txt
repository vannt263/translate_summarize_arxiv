    "although the m dwarfs are the most numerous stars in our galaxy , the mass , metalicity and age dependencies of their stellar luminosities and radii are poorly calibrated .",
    "the reason is the selection effect that plays against the detection of fainter and smaller stars .",
    "less than 20 binaries with low - mass dm components have empirically - determined masses , radii , luminosities and temperatures ( see section [ sec : global ] , table [ tab : stars ] ) . as a result",
    "the mass - luminosity relation is determined by only a few low - mass stars .",
    "this deficiency hindered the development of the models for the cool dense atmospheres of the m dwarfs .",
    "it is established that all available models underestimate the radii ( by around 1015 per cent ) and overestimate the temperatures ( by 200300 k ) of short - period binaries with dm components @xcite .",
    "the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ) contains a great number of photometric data @xcite that allows searching of variable stars and determination of their periods and types of variability . a multiparametric method for search for variable objects in large datasets",
    "was tested on the nsvs @xcite and as a result many eclipsing stars were discovered .",
    "one of them was gsc  2314 - 0530 @xmath17 nsvs  6550671 ( @xmath14=02@xmath18 , @xmath19=+@xmath20 ) .",
    "on the base of the nsvs photometry obtained in 19992000 we derived the ephemeris :    @xmath21    and built its light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nsvs ] ) .",
    "we found that this star has been assigned also as swasp  j022050.85 + 332047.6 according to the superwasp photometric survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported its coincidence with the _ rosat _ x - ray source 1rxs  j022050.7 + 332049 .",
    "initially gsc  2314 - 0530 attracted our interest by its short orbital period because there were only several systems with non - degenerate components and periods below the short - period limit of 0.22 days @xcite : gsc  1387 - 0475 with @xmath22 d @xcite , asas  j071829 - 0336.7 with @xmath23 d @xcite , the star v34 in the globular cluster 47 tuc with @xmath24 d @xcite and bw3  v38 with orbital period @xmath25 d @xcite .    when we established that the components of gsc  2314 - 0530 were dm stars our interest increased and we undertook intensive photometric and spectral observations in order to determine its global parameters and to add a new information for the dm stars as well as for the short - period binaries .",
    "the ccd photometry of gsc  2314 - 0530 in @xmath0 bands was carried out at rozhen national astronomical observatory with the 2-m rcc telescope equipped with versarray ccd camera ( 1300 @xmath26 1340 pixels , 20 @xmath27 m pixel , field of 5.25 @xmath26 5.35 arcmin ) as well as with the 60-cm cassegrain telescope using the fli pl09000 ccd camera ( 3056 @xmath26 3056 pixels , 12 @xmath27 m pixel , field of 17.1 @xmath26 17.1 arcmin ) .",
    "the average photometric precision per data point was 0.005  0.008 mag for the 60-cm telescope and 0.002  0.003 mag for the 2-m telescope .",
    "table [ tab : log1 ] presents the journal of our photometric observations .",
    "it should be noted that the observations on 2009 december 30 are synchronous in the @xmath0 colors .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the small orbital angular momentum is characteristic feature of all short - period systems ranging from cvs to cb that seem to be old , being at later stages of the angular momentum loss evolution as a result of the period decrease .",
    "we calculated the orbital angular momentum of the target by the expression @xcite    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is in days and @xmath30 are in solar units .",
    "the obtained value @xmath31 of gsc  2314 - 0530 is considerably smaller than those of the rs cvn binaries and detached systems which have @xmath32 .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of gsc  2314 - 0530 is smaller even than those of the contact systems which have @xmath33 .",
    "it is bigger only than those of the short - period cvs of su uma type .",
    "the small orbital angular momentum of gsc  2314 - 0530 implies existence of past episode of angular momentum loss during the binary evolution .",
    "it means also that gsc  2314 - 0530 is not pre - ms object .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the values of @xmath34 of its components .",
    "the x - ray emission of the stellar coronae are directly related to the presence of magnetic fields and consequently gives information about the efficiency of the stellar dynamo .",
    "@xcite established that the x - ray luminosity decreased for later m stars while the ratio @xmath35 did not change significantly from m0 to m6 . as a result he proposed the ratio @xmath35 as most relevant measure of activity of m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found that the upper boundary of @xmath35 for late m stars is @xmath36 .",
    "besides all indicators of stellar activity in the optical ( surface inhomogeneities , emission lines , flares ) the star gsc  2314 - 0530 shows also x - ray emission ( it is identified as _ rosat _",
    "x - ray source 1rxs  j022050.7 + 332049 ) and x - ray flares .    on the basis of the measured x - ray flux @xmath37 ergs @xmath38 @xmath39 of gsc  2314 - 0530 at quiescence @xcite and derived distance 59 pc we calculated its x - ray luminosity @xmath40 ergs s@xmath41 .",
    "this value is at the upper boundary @xmath42 29 for dm stars @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath43 of gsc  2314 - 0530 is almost at the upper boundary of this ratio and considerably bigger than those of the m dwarfs studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is known that the activity and angular momentum loss tend to be saturated at high - rotation rates @xcite .",
    "due to its short period and high activity gsc  2314 - 0530 is perhaps an example of such saturation .",
    "our observed field ( fig . [ fig : chart ] ) contains the weak star usno - b1 1233 - 0046425 .",
    "we called it twin due to the same tangential shift as our target star gsc  2314 - 0530 .",
    "table [ tab : colors ] presents the proper motion and the colors of twin according to the catalogue nomad .",
    "usno - b1  1233 - 0046425 has @xmath44 corresponding to temperature less than 3200 k.    we suspect that our `` twins '' may form visual binary . the angular distance between them of 61",
    "arcsec corresponds to linear separation around 3500 au for distance of 59 pc .",
    "such a supposition is reasonable because it is known that the short - period close binaries often are triple systems @xcite .",
    "particularly , the object tres  her0 - 07621 from our table [ tab : stars ] has a red stellar neighbor at a distance 8 arcsec with close proper motion @xcite .    the check of the supposition if twin is physical companion of gsc  2314 - 0530 needs astrometric observations of the `` twins '' .",
    "the analysis of our photometric and spectral observations of the newly discovered eclipsing binary gsc  2314 - 0530 allows us to derive the following conclusions :    \\(1 ) this star is the shortest - period binary with dm components which period is below the short - period limit .",
    "\\(2 ) by simultaneous radial velocity solution and light curve solution we determined the global parameters of gsc  2314 - 0530 : inclination @xmath11 ; orbital separation @xmath12 r@xmath5 ; masses @xmath4 m@xmath5 and @xmath6 m@xmath5 ; radii @xmath7 r@xmath5 and @xmath8 r@xmath5 ; temperatures @xmath2 k and @xmath3 k ; luminosities @xmath9 l@xmath5 and @xmath10 l@xmath5 ; distance @xmath13 pc .",
    "\\(3 ) we derived empirical relations mass@xmath16 , mass  radius and mass  temperature on the basis of the parameters of known binaries with low - mass dm components .",
    "\\(4 ) the distorted light curve of gsc  2314 - 0530 were reproduced by two cool spots on the primary component .",
    "the next sign of the activity of gsc  2314 - 0530 is the strong h@xmath14 emission of its components .",
    "moreover we registered 6 flares of gsc  2314 - 0530 .",
    "half of them occurred at the phases of maximum visibility of the larger stable cool spot on the primary .",
    "the analysis of all appearances of magnetic activity revealed existence of long - lived active area on the primary of gsc  2314 - 0530 .",
    "the high activity of the target is natural consequence of the fast rotation and low temperatures of its components .",
    "our study of the newly discovered short - period eclipsing binary gsc  2314 - 0530 presents a next small step toward understanding dme stars and adds a new information to the poor statistic of the low - mass dm stars .",
    "recently they became especially interesting as appropriate targets for planet searches due to the relative larger transit depths .",
    "the research was supported partly by funds of projects do  02 - 362 of the bulgarian scientific foundation .",
    "this research make use of the simbad and vizier databases , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
