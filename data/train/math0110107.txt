    "in this paper we give an estimate of the filling order in some particular cases of infinite finitely generated groups and of lie groups .",
    "we may talk about filling area of a loop in riemannian manifolds , in finitely presented groups and , more generally , in metric spaces .",
    "in a metric space we begin by fixing a small @xmath3 . by @xmath3-filling area of a loop one",
    "means the minimal number of small loops of length at most @xmath3 ( `` bricks '' ) one has to put one next to the other in order to obtain a net bounded by the given loop .",
    "usually we choose @xmath4 . by means of the filling area one can define the filling function and the filling order in a metric space .",
    "the filling order is the order in @xmath5 of the maximal area needed to fill a loop of length @xmath6 ( see section [ fil ] for definitions and details ) . with the terminology introduced in section [ fil ] , if in a metric space @xmath7 a function in the same equivalence class as the filling function is smaller that @xmath8 or @xmath9 , it is sometimes said that the space @xmath7 _ satisfies a linear , quadratic or exponential isoperimetric inequality_.    it is interesting to study these notions for two reasons at least : because a finitely presented group @xmath10 has a solvable word problem if and only if its filling function is ( bounded by ) a recursive function and because the filling order is a quasi - isometry invariant @xcite .",
    "we recall that a _ quasi - isometry _ between two metric spaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a map @xmath13 such that @xmath14 for some fixed positive constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is at a finite hausdorff distance from the image of @xmath18 . if such a map exists between @xmath19 and @xmath17 , the two metric spaces are called _ quasi - isometric_. a property invariant up to quasi - isometry is called _ a geometric property . _    we shall study two classes of metric spaces : lie solvable groups endowed with a left invariant riemannian structure and lattices in semisimple groups , endowed with a word metric .",
    "the solvable groups are interesting as far as few things are known on their behaviour up to quasi - isometry . in the case of nilpotent groups",
    "there is more information .",
    "first , a consequence of gromov s theorem on polynomial growth @xcite is that virtual nilpotency is a geometric property in the class of groups ( we recall that a group is called _ virtually nilpotent _ if it contains a nilpotent subgroup of finite index ) . in free nilpotent groups ,",
    "the filling order is polynomial of degree @xmath20 , where @xmath15 is the class of the group ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the heisenberg group @xmath21 it was shown by thurston in @xcite that the filling order is cubic ( which implies that @xmath21 is not automatic ) .",
    "the other heisenberg groups @xmath22 , have quadratic filling .",
    "this was conjectured by thurston in @xcite , gromov gave an outline of proof in @xcite and d. allcock gave the complete proof @xcite by means of symplectic geometry .",
    "y. olshanskii and m. sapir later gave a combinatorial proof @xcite .",
    "the behaviour is much more diversified in the case of solvable groups . to begin with",
    ", the property of being virtually solvable is not a geometric property in the class of groups anymore @xcite . on the other hand , certain solvable groups are very rigid with respect to quasi - isometry ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the estimate of a quasi - isometry invariant for a class of solvable groups , as the one given in this paper , should be interesting .",
    "the filling order is already known for some solvable groups .",
    "w. thurston has shown that the group @xmath23 has exponential filling ( so it is not automatic ) @xcite .",
    "s. gersten showed that the baumslag - solitar groups @xmath24 have exponential filling order for @xmath25 , which in particular implies that they are not automatic , while they are known to be asynchronously automatic",
    ". m. gromov showed that @xmath26 has polynomial filling order , without specifying the degree @xcite .",
    "also , g. arzhantseva and d. v. osin @xcite constructed a sequence of discrete non - polycyclic solvable groups with filling orders that are at most cubic .",
    "we should note here that the discrete solvable groups we deal with in this paper are all polycyclic , as lattices in lie groups .    in the case of lattices ,",
    "the filling order is already known for almost all ambient semisimple groups of @xmath1-rank one ( see the comments following remark [ fact ] ) . if the semisimple group has @xmath1-rank",
    "@xmath27 then the filling order is exponential @xcite .",
    "we note that this has already been proven by w. thurston in @xcite in the particular case of @xmath28 , from which result he deduced that @xmath29 is not combable . also in @xcite w. thurston stated ( without giving a proof ) that the filling order of @xmath30 , is quadratic . in the cases where the @xmath1-rank is at least @xmath2",
    "it is known that the filling order is at most exponential @xcite . in a previous paper",
    "we have proved that for some @xmath0-rank one lattices ( among which the hilbert modular groups ) and for some solvable groups the filling order is at most `` asymptotically cubic '' @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove the following more general and stronger results .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath7 be a product of symmetric spaces and euclidean buildings , @xmath7 of rank at least @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a geodesic ray which is not contained in a rank one or in a rank two factor of @xmath7 .",
    "* the riemannian filling order in the horosphere @xmath32 of @xmath7 is quadratic .",
    "* let @xmath33 be a lie group acting by isometries , transitively with compact stabilizers on the horosphere @xmath32 of @xmath7",
    ". in @xmath33 endowed with any left invariant metric the filling order is quadratic .",
    "the same is true for every discrete group @xmath34 acting properly discontinuously cocompactly on @xmath32 , @xmath34 endowed with a word metric .",
    "the previous result has been obtained independently by e. leuzinger and chr .",
    "pittet @xcite in the case @xmath35 .    for a definition of euclidean buildings",
    "see @xcite , for a definition of horospheres see section [ h ] .",
    "we note that the quadratic estimate on the filling function is sharp .",
    "this is because in a product of symmetric spaces and euclidean buildings , which is of rank @xmath36 , every horosphere contains isometric copies of the euclidean space @xmath37 .",
    "[ t2 ] the filling order in any irreducible @xmath38rank one lattice of a semisimple group of @xmath1-rank at least @xmath2 is at most asymptotically quadratic .",
    "that is , for every @xmath39 there exists @xmath40 such that @xmath41    we emphasize that the filling order in all @xmath0-rank one lattices in semisimple groups of rank at least @xmath27 is at least quadratic .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are maximal flats in the symmetric space associated to the semisimple group on which the lattices act cocompactly .",
    "thus theorem [ t2 ] gives an `` asymptotically sharp '' estimate .",
    "_ examples where the two theorems apply _ :    \\(1 ) all solvable groups @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an injective homomorphism with diagonalizable image , verify the hypothesis of theorem [ t1 ] . the same is true for the groups of upper ( lower ) triangular matrices of order at least @xmath45 with the set of diagonals of the form @xmath46 for a fixed vector @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "\\(2 ) any irreducible lattice in a semisimple group having a @xmath1-rank one factor is a @xmath0-rank one lattice ( @xcite , lemma 1.1 ) .",
    "in particular the hilbert modular groups @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the ring of integers of a totally real field @xmath51 with @xmath52\\geq 3 $ ] .    in @xcite one can also find examples of @xmath0-rank one lattices in simple groups .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ prel ]",
    "we recall some basic facts about filling area , asymptotic cones , buildings and ( @xmath0-rank one ) lattices in semisimple groups .",
    "in particular we recall that for every lattice there exists a space @xmath53 obtained from the ambient symmetric space @xmath54 by deleting a countable family of disjoint open horoballs on which the lattice acts with compact quotient ( see section [ r ] ) .",
    "it follows that the filling order in the lattice is the same as the filling order in @xmath53 .",
    "in the case of the solvable groups we consider , one just has to look at horospheres .",
    "since the projection of the exterior of the corresponding open horoball on the horosphere diminishes distances , one can study the whole exterior of the open horoball , which can also be denoted by @xmath53 , instead of the horosphere .",
    "thus , both in the case of lattices and in the one of solvable groups it suffices to estimate the filling order in a metric space @xmath53 obtained from a symmetric space by deleting a family of disjoint open horoballs .",
    "the main tool we use is the asymptotic cone .",
    "this notion has been introduced by m. gromov in @xcite and consists , philosophically speaking , of giving `` an image seen from infinitely far away''of a metric space ( see section [ fil ] for definition and properties ) . to every metric space one",
    "associates a whole class of asymptotic cones ( possibly isometric ) .",
    "there are similarities of arbitrary factor `` acting '' on this class , that is , sending a cone into another ( remark [ si ] ) .",
    "we dispose of a result , due to m. gromov and p. papasoglu , allowing to deduce from an uniform estimate of the filling order in all asymptotic cones an estimate of the filling order for the initial metric space ( section [ fil ] , theorem [ crit ] ) .",
    "thus , instead of considering the space @xmath53 one can consider its asymptotic cones .",
    "let @xmath55 be such an asymptotic cone .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that each @xmath55 is obtained from an euclidean building @xmath56 by deleting a family of disjoint open horoballs .    in section [ horo ]",
    "we first place ourselves in an euclidean building . essentially , an euclidean building is a bunch of `` flats '' , that is , of isometric copies of an euclidean space . by deleting disjoint horoballs",
    "one makes polytopic holes into these flats .",
    "these polytopic holes can take , up to similarity , only a finite number of shapes .",
    "thus we may hope to reduce the problem of filling a loop in a space like @xmath55 to that of filling a loop in an euclidean space with polytopic holes .",
    "we first prove some global and local properties of such a polytopic hole , that is , of the trace of a horoball in a maximal flat",
    ". we also provide a way to join two points on a connected horosphere by polygonal lines with length comparable to the distance , in two different cases ( see lemma [ fetze ] and lemma [ fetze2 ] ) . as a byproduct we give new proofs of the theorems on the nondistorsion of horospheres in euclidean buildings and symmetric spaces .",
    "( theorems [ nondist1 ] and [ nondist2 ] in this paper ) .    in section [ k ]",
    "we prove the main theorem , theorem [ fillgen ] , on the filling order in the exterior of a disjoint union of open horoballs .",
    "we give here an outline of the proof .",
    "first it is shown that a loop contained in the exterior of one open horoball , @xmath57 , where @xmath31 is not parallel to any rank 2 factor , has a quadratic filling area , as soon as the loop is contained in only one apartment ( proposition [ polit3 ] ) .",
    "then we show that under the same hypothesis the same conclusion is true for certain loops contained in the union of two apartments ( proposition [ camera ] ) . then we prove theorem [ fillk0 ] , which is a weaker version of theorem [ fillgen ] . this",
    "is done as follows .",
    "up to spending a linear filling area , a generic loop can always be assumed to be contained in the union of a finite set of maximal flats , the number of maximal flats being of the same order as the length @xmath5 of the loop . in filling the loop",
    ", there is a problem when one passes from one flat to another .",
    "more precisely , by means of proposition [ camera ] one can show that when passing from one flat to another , in the process of filling the loop , one might have to spend an area of order @xmath58 .",
    "this explains why instead of a quadratic filling area , one obtains a cubic filling area , in this first approach . for certain curves contained in",
    "a union of maximal flats of uniformly bounded cardinal a quadratic filling area is obtained .",
    "in section [ qsol ] it is shown that part ( b ) of theorem [ fillk0 ] implies part ( b ) of theorem [ fillgen ] and in particular theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "the proof of the previous implication is done in two steps .",
    "firstly it is shown that loops composed of a uniformly bounded number of minimizing almost polygonal curves have quadratic filling area ( see the end of section [ horo ] for a definition of minimizing almost polygonal curves ) .",
    "secondly an induction procedure is applied .",
    "section [ aq ] contains the proof that theorem [ fillk0 ] , ( a ) , implies theorem [ fillgen ] , ( a ) , and theorem [ t2 ] . according to theorem [ crit ] , in order to prove theorem [ fillgen ] , ( a ) , it is enough to prove that the filling order is quadratic in all the asymptotic cones of the space @xmath53 on which a @xmath0-rank one lattice @xmath10 acts properly discontinuously cocompactly . by theorem [ fillk0 ] , ( a )",
    ", it is already known that in every asymptotic cone @xmath55 of @xmath53 the filling order is at most cubic .",
    "it is shown that in reality the filling order is not cubic but quadratic .    to understand the proof of the previous statement we should see first why the filling order in the euclidean plane is quadratic . in the euclidean plane",
    ", any loop @xmath59 of length @xmath6 can be filled with at most @xmath60 bricks of length @xmath61 ( one may think of the bricks as being small squares ) . to fill it with bricks of length @xmath62 , it is enough if we fill the @xmath61-bricks with @xmath63-bricks , which can be done with @xmath64 bricks for each @xmath61-brick . in this way the initial loop @xmath59 is filled with at most @xmath65 bricks of length @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the fact that for every @xmath66 , however small , we may fill @xmath59 with at most @xmath67 @xmath68-bricks is due to the fact that the quadratic filling is preserved in the small .",
    "this should also happen , under replacement of the exponent @xmath27 by the exponent @xmath2 , in a space with a cubical filling order .",
    "but in the space @xmath55 the first important remark is that , when one fills a loop of length @xmath6 with bricks of length @xmath69 , one puts @xmath70 bricks with uncontrolled shapes and @xmath71 bricks which bound small euclidean squares entirely contained in @xmath55 ( remark [ rc ] ) .",
    "this means that , for @xmath72 , the @xmath68-filling area of the loop tends to become more and more quadratic as @xmath68 becomes smaller and smaller . since we may choose bricks as small as we want , the quadratic factor will end by dominating the cubic factor .",
    "and then , by applying similarities ( remark [ si ] ) , since this is a reasoning which is done simultaneously in all asymptotic cones , one can come back to bricks of length one and obtain a quadratic filling order .    in the appendix we provide an isoperimetric inequality for a hypersurface in an euclidean space composed of points at a fixed distance from a certain polytope @xmath73 ( proposition [ lpolit ] ) .",
    "from this we derive an isoperimetric inequality for every polytopic hypersurface whose points are at a distance between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , from the polytope @xmath73 .",
    "the constants appearing in the isoperimetric inequality in the first case depend only on @xmath73 while in the second case they also depend on @xmath76 .",
    "the second result is useful in the proof of our main theorem .",
