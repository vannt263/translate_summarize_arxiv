    "the ch magnetic field then guides cmes toward the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite attribute the deflection to gradients in the background magnetic energy density , which would also cause cmes to tend to deflect toward the hcs . at solar minimum , the hcs remains flat at low latitudes , so predominantly latitudinal deflections should occur as a result of magnetic forces .",
    "during other times of the solar cycle , the hcs transitions to a more complex configuration allowing deflections to have a more significant longitudinal component .",
    "the 15 cmes of @xcite occurred during solar minimum ( between 2008 and 2010 ) so magnetic forces would explain the observed smaller longitudinal component of the deflections .",
    "cme deflections also occur in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations @xcite . as with the observed cmes ,",
    "the mhd cmes tend towards regions of lower magnetic energy .",

    ", hereafter referred to as k13 , we introduced forecat ( forecasting a cme s altered trajectory ) , a versatile model for cme deflection . given a magnetogram and the initial cme characteristics , forecat uses a simplified solar background to predict the expected deflection of the cme .",
    "forecat includes the radial propagation and expansion of the cme as well as the background magnetic forces that deflect the cme .",
    "because forecat is optimized to be computationally efficient , as opposed to an mhd model , we are easily able to run a large number of cases .    in k13 , we explored cmes erupting from the active region ( ar ) 0758 in carrington rotation ( cr ) 2029 .",
    "this background contains strong gradients in the magnetic field strength as the ar is located in close proximity to both a low latitude ch and the streamer belt ( sb ) that transitions into the hcs at farther distances .",
    "the strong global magnetic gradients in this background caused the majority of the simulated cmes to deflect to the hcs , the minimum in the magnetic field strength , within the first few solar radii .",
    "we describe this cme motion as deflection toward the `` magnetic minimum . ''",
    "close to the sun the magnetic minimum tends to correspond to local null points resulting from the orientation of the sb and any ar within the streamer region . at farther distances ,",
    "the magnetic minimum corresponds to the hcs . in the strong background explored in k13",
    ", most cmes deflected to the sb magnetic minimum within the first few solar radii .",
    "the cmes remained at the sb minimum as it transitioned to the hcs minimum and exhibited negligible deflection as the cmes continued propagating to 1 au . if the sb and hcs minimum do not correspond to the same position , such as would be the case for a cme erupting within a pseudostreamer , we expect additional deflection to the hcs minimum at further distances .",
    "additionally , if the local ar magnetic gradients initially deflect the cme , a change in the direction of deflection may occur when the global gradients begin to dominate the local gradients .",
    "we define global gradients as those resulting from the relative orientation of chs and the hcs .",
    "k13 explored deflection due the effects of the global background rather than local effects .",
    "here we consider the effect of both local and global magnetic gradients .",
    "however our simplified background with a static magnetic field more accurately describes the global gradients since the local gradients evolve on shorter time scales .",
    "works such as @xcite and @xcite show that local gradients at ars might be important .",
    "for example , filaments can undergo significant deflections or rolling motions before the formation of the cme flux rope that encapsulates the filament .",
    "reproducing the rolling motion of filaments requires accurately describing the temporal evolution of local gradients that can evolve on time scales similar to the motion of the filament ( of order hours ) .",
    "the global gradients also evolve in time , but this change occurs much slower than the time necessary for a cme to propagate through the corona .",
    "future work with forecat will address the temporal evolution of the local magnetic gradients , including those of ars , which can cause variation in the initial non - radial motion .    here , we present results from an expanded version of forecat that follows the full three - dimensional motion of a deflecting cme .",
    "we extend the analysis of k13 to multiple crs to look at variations in the deflections of cmes throughout the solar cycle .",
    "based on the conclusions of k13 we ask if all cmes deflect to the magnetic minimum and if this deflection always occurs below 4 @xmath0 .",

    "the deflection is sensitive to the actual number of points , however the solution converges for grids as large as 15x13 , which is the grid we use throughout this work .",

    "we find that the inclusion of the rotation has little effect on the deflection - the difference between the latitude and longitude of the rotating and non - rotating cases is negligible .",
    "it is possible that larger rotation could cause the cme to experience highly different forces from those felt in the original orientation , we show that this can occur for cme 2029d when we compare with the k13 results in section [ fc1comp ] .",
    "we present a new three - dimensional version of forecat , which we use to study the trends in cme deflection .",
    "we also show that torques due to differential forces along the cme can cause rotation about the cme axis . to the best of our knowledge , forecat is currently the only simple model which simulates both deflection and rotation and runs fast enough to be useful for either real time predictions or large parameter space studies .",
    "the deflection of a cme depends on both cme parameters and the background magnetic field .",
    "forecat results for cmes initiated in cr 2029 and cr 2077 show that the majority of the deflection occurs below 10@xmath0 . for a strong magnetic background , such as cr 2029 ,",
    "the deflections are primarily determined at distances less than 2 @xmath0 .",
    "our model , forecat simulates the magnetic deflection using actual magnetic forces determined from the solar background but relies on simplified empirical models to describe the cme s radial propagation and expansion .",
    "we have shown that the radial velocity model and cme size affect deflection so it is essential to develop realistic propagation and expansion models so that forecat can accurately predict cme deflections .",
    "forecat s ad - hoc kinematic model can be constrained with observations and the deflection can be used to constrain cme masses , as well as the drag and background solar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and direction of the deflection is determined by cme parameters such as the mass and velocity , as well as the solar magnetic field and magnetic gradients .",
    "both global gradients , determined by the relative orientation of chs and the hcs , and local gradients , related to ars or other small scale structures , can contribute to the total deflection .",
    "we find that wide , slow , low mass cmes in backgrounds with strong magnetic fields and magnetic gradients ( i.e. near solar maximum ) tend to deflect the most and that these deflections typically have a larger longitudinal component as a result of both local and global magnetic gradients",
    ".    many cmes do not deflect to the magnetic minimum , the hcs on global scales .",
    "the global magnetic gradients always cause a cme to deflect toward the magnetic minimum but the forces are not necessarily strong enough to fully deflect the cme to the magnetic minimum .",
    "alternatively , the forces may be sufficiently strong to push the cme beyond the hcs .",
    "this can occur when local gradients cause the cme to deflect towards a null point in the low corona and the cme moves underneath the hcs at a height where the streamer region has not yet transitioned into the hcs .",
    "the cme can also deflect beyond the the hcs at further distances as a result of global gradients . when a cme reaches the hcs , the magnetic forces change direction as the cme attempts to deflect beyond it .",
    "however , since the magnetic forces decrease rapidly with distance , if the cme reaches the hcs beyond a few solar radii the force may be insufficient to slow the cme s deflection motion .",
    "if the cme reaches a magnetic minimum in the low corona the changing forces can halt the deflection motion and act as a potential well , trapping the cme at the magnetic minimum .    during solar minimum ( cr 2077 ) , the weak magnetic field and gradients leads to smaller deflections that tend to have very little longitudinal components .",
    "however , during more complex backgrounds with stronger magnetic field , such as the declining phase cr 2029 , the magnitude of the deflections increases and they tend to have a larger longitudinal component .",
    "the higher inclination of the hcs causes the global magnetic gradients to have a larger longitudinal component .",
    "additionally , this declining phase cr has stronger local gradients that deflect the cme perpendicular to the pil of an ar . for cmes that erupt from the quiet sun , the local magnetic gradients",
    "typically do not contribute significantly to the deflection so that the direction of the deflection is typically determined solely by the global gradients .    at distances where the forces are negligible ,",
    "angular momentum is conserved and the deflection is proportional to the inverse of the distance .",
    "we suggest that observed interplanetary cmes deflections be split into two categories , those which are deflected primarily in the low corona ( and thereafter having a constant angular momentum ) , and those which are actively accelerated at interplanetary distances ( where the angular momentum is still changing ) . deflections proportional to the inverse of the distance may result from a constant deflection velocity obtained in the lower corona , and not require any additional interplanetary deflection .",
    "interplanetary deflections exceeding the inverse of the distance , however , would indicate additional deflection forces or a radial deceleration of the cme .",
    "additionally , we expect a difference in the direction of the deflection for these two categories .",
    "cmes deflecting mainly in the low corona can deflect in a wide range of directions based on the direction of the coronal gradients .",
    "cmes which are actively accelerated by interplanetary forces will systematically deflect to the east or the west if the cme is faster or slower than the solar wind @xcite .",
    "this work has only used static magnetic fields that were derived from synoptic maps .",
    "the global magnetic field does not vary greatly on the time scales used to map the solar magnetic field .",
    "however , the global magnetic gradients alone do not determine the deflection , rather we see that local gradients can contribute significantly , particularly for slow , low mass cmes in strong magnetic fields .",
    "in addition to the inherent temporal lag associated with synoptic maps , ars can evolve on time scales shorter than the time it takes the cme to propagate through the low corona so the local gradients should be accurately represented both spatially and temporally .",
    "the first version of forecat determined the deflection of a cme cross - section within a fixed deflection plane , the direction of which was determined by the magnetic gradients at 2 @xmath0 .",
    "major changes have been incorporated to the version of forecat used in this paper .",
    "first , we abandon the deflection plane - the cme is free to deflect in 3d space .",
    "second , the full cme flux rope , opposed to only a cross section , is considered via a grid representing a toroidal surface .",
    "third , the initial cme is aligned with an polarity inversion line to determine the location and tilt .",
    "fourth , we use a self - similar expansion model instead of the msoe model .",
    "fifth , the @xcite density model has been replaced with a modified version of the @xcite model to better describe the three - dimensional density variations .",
    "sixth , we include the effects of solar rotation , including the resulting interplanetary magnetic field beyond the source surface of the pfss model . finally , we can include rotation of the cme due to differential deflection forces along the toroidal axis .",
    "figure [ fig : fc1comp ] shows the effect of each these changes on the latitudinal ( top ) and longitudinal ( middle ) deflection and comparison with the results of k13 .",
    "the case considered in k13 corresponds to cme 2029d from this work . the dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] represents the k13 results using the pfss model . to replicate the k13 results as best as possible",
    ", we use a 1x3 grid ( an odd number of points are required in the poloidal direction ) , place the cme at the same location with the same tilt as k13 , use the expansion from the msoe model and the @xcite density model , and do not include the effects of solar rotation or cme rotation .",
    "the only differences between this version , hereafter case 1 , shown in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] , and the k13 is the freedom from the deflection plane and the enforced decrease in the deflection velocity to conserve angular momentum .",
    "we immediately see a significant difference in the cme deflection .",
    "the k13 cme was forced to move in the direction of the global magnetic gradients at 2 @xmath0 , however this direction is not aligned with the direction of the local magnetic gradients lower in the corona .",
    "the k13 cme only experienced the component of the local gradients pointing in the same direction as the global gradients .",
    "this forced the cme to quickly move toward the magnetic minimum at the hcs , then stop its motion as its momentum carried it toward the opposite side of the magnetic potential well at the hcs .",
    "case 1 is free to deflect in the direction of the local magnetic gradients and begins deflecting to the northeast , nearly perpendicular to the southeastern motion of the k13 cme . since case 1 experiences the full magnetic force in the low corona , opposed to the deflection plane component , it deflects more than the k13 cme .",
    "this initial northeastern deflection causes the cme to move along the hcs at further distances , rather than moving directly into in and being trapped by the potential well .",
    "we next consider the effect of having a higher resolution grid covering the front of the cme , rather than a single cross section near the cme nose .",
    "case 2 , shown in orange in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] , is the same as case 1 , but the grid has been changed to the standard 15x13 grid used in this work .",
    "the change in grid causes a small increase in the longitudinal deflection but a noticeable change in the latitudinal motion .",
    "the latitudinal motion initially begins in the same direction as before , but at a lower rate .",
    "the latitudinal deflection then reverse and the cme moves slightly past its initial latitude .",
    "the cme deflects according to the average force from all grid points , so increasing the number of grid points used decreases the relative contribution of any single grid point .",
    "a large number of grid points averages out any extreme values and tends to cause smaller average forces .",
    "the deflection tends to decrease as the number of grid point increases with the rate of change decreasing until convergence near a 15x13 grid .",
    "cmes in this work are initially aligned with a pil to minimize the initial magnetic forces .",
    "this corresponds to a slight change in the initial location from k13 and a larger change in the tilt .",
    "case 3 ( yellow line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] ) is the same as case 2 , but with the updated initial position and tilt .",
    "this causes a minor difference in the longitudinal motion and an increase in the latitudinal deflection with the result being more similar to case 1 than case 2 .",
    "this change is primarily due to the 23@xmath1 change in the tilt of the cme .",
    "case 4 , the green line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] , is the same as case 3 , but with self - similar expansion instead of the msoe model .",
    "the msoe model causes rapid overexpansion below 2 @xmath0 followed by a gradual decrease in the angular size of the cme at further distances . for this case",
    ", we find very little difference between the two expansion models , with a slight decrease in the deflection for the self - similar model which expands less at small distances .",
    "case 5 , the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] , includes the modified @xcite model instead of the @xcite density model .",
    "this line is essentially indistinguishable from the black line representing case 6 .",
    "we have increased the thickness of the line corresponding to case 5 to show it lies underneath case 6 .",
    "the change in density model causes a large increase in both the latitudinal and longitudinal deflection .",
    "the two density models agree near 1 au , however they differ by nearly an order of magnitude in the corona .",
    "the @xcite model is less dense which causes a significant reduction in the total drag and leads to larger deflections .",
    "the model matches the version used in this work when we include the effects of solar rotation ( black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] ) .",
    "inclusion of the parker spiral causes almost no noticeable change in the deflection . by the distances",
    "as which the magnetic field has gained a significant component the magnetic forces have become too weak to strongly influence the cme s motion .",
    "finally , we can include cme rotation due to the differential deflection forces , which we show with the purple line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc1comp ] .",
    "the bottom panel shows the change in tilt of this cme , and comparison with the non - rotating case .",
    "for the two cases considered in section [ cmerot ] , the cmes rotated less than 10@xmath1 and the inclusion of rotation had little effect on the rotation .",
    "this cme erupted from a complex environment- an ar located near the location of the hcs at further distances .",
    "this cause the cme to rotate over 100@xmath1 , and this causes a significant effect on the deflection .",
    "using equation [ acceleq ] we determine how the deflection should vary based on changes in either the initial cme parameters , or properties of the background solar model .",
    "we compare these predictions with forecat results in section [ modelsens ] and [ cmeinputs ] .",
    "we express the cme density , @xmath94 , in terms of the cme mass , @xmath30 , and the cme volume determined as the product of the toroidal length , @xmath95 , and the cross - sectional area , @xmath96 .",
    "the non - radial cme acceleration can be approximated in terms of the non - radial displacement , @xmath97 and time , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath98 we consider the amount of deflection after the cme has propagated a specified radial distance , @xmath99 , which we relate to the time using the radial cme velocity , @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the curvature in the tension force can be approximated as @xmath100 and the magnetic gradients approximated as @xmath101 where @xmath44 is a representative length scale of the gradients in the magnetic energy . solving for the non - radial displacement , we find @xmath102 where we have assumed that the solar wind is purely radial .",
    "this equation describes the linear deflection assuming constant forces in the time it takes the cme to propagate @xmath99 but we can use it to understand how the deflection varies with input parameters .",
    "the change in the angular position of the cme depends on the linear non - radial displacement and the radial distance of the cme .",
    "we find a straightforward dependence on the cme mass and final propagation velocity .",
    "these terms only affect the coefficient that multiplies the force terms , rather than affecting the individual forces . as the mass increases ,",
    "the deflection decreases because the forces act upon higher densities . as the velocity increases , the deflection decreases because the cme requires less time to travel @xmath103 and the non - radial forces act upon the cme for less time .",
    "an increase in either the mass or velocity causes a decrease in the deflection but eq .",
    "[ scalingeq ] we expect the deflection to be more sensitive to velocity than mass because the displacement is proportional to @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the other parameters affect the individual force terms .",
    "we first consider the case without drag to better understand the effect on the deflection forces .",
    "the magnetic pressure and magnetic tension terms have nearly the same form , the relative contributions depend on the ratio @xmath106 .",
    "the length scale of the gradients will change throughout the solar cycle . on average",
    ", this length will decrease as the solar magnetic configuration becomes more complex near solar maximum .",
    "the length scale of the gradients also decreases with distance as the magnetic field configurations simplifies into only radial magnetic field and the hcs .",
    "if the cross - sectional width is significantly larger than the scale of the gradients , which will happen for wide cmes near solar maximum or far from the sun , then the magnetic pressure gradient term dominates the deflection . in this case",
    ", the deflection will increase as the width increase .",
    "the width does not affect the magnetic pressure gradient force but causes a decrease in the cme density , assuming a constant mass .",
    "the deflection will depend strongly on the width as the displacement is proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "the deflection will also increase as the length scale of the gradients decreases since the force is proportional to @xmath108 .",
    "if the cross - sectional width is significantly smaller than the scale of the gradients , which will happen for narrow cmes close to the sun near solar minimum , the magnetic tension term dominates the deflection force .",
    "the net dependence of the deflection on the width is then proportional to @xmath3 . for an increase in the width , the decrease in the density outweighs the decrease in the tension force , causing a net increase in the deflection .    when the width and gradient length scales are comparable both the magnetic pressure gradients and magnetic tension contribute to the deflection .",
    "the deflection will still increase as the length scale decreases , but to a lesser extent as the tension term is unaffected .",
    "conversely , as the width increases the tension term decreases while the magnetic pressure term remains unaffected .",
    "the corresponding decrease in density will cause an increase in deflection that will exceed the corresponding increase in the tension - only case but be smaller than that of the gradient - only case .",
    "for all cases , as the magnetic field increases , the deflection will increase proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "we expect larger deflections near solar maximum when the magnetic field is the strongest . without the effects of drag",
    ", we expect the largest deflections for wide , slow , low mass cmes near solar maximum .",
    "when the effects of drag are included , the amount of deflection decreases but the zeroth order scaling relations do not change .",
    "the net force will still be smaller than the case without drag as the drag acts in the opposite direction to the velocity caused by the deflection forces .",
    "this decrease in the amount of deflection will increase as the drag coefficient increases .",
    "for the case where the magnetic pressure gradients exceed the tension , the deflection will still increase proportional to @xmath107 because the drag decreases proportional to @xmath110 so it will have a less noticeable effect for wide cmes . for the tension - only case , the tension will increase as the width decreases , however the drag increases at the same rate so that the net effect will still be proportional to @xmath3 because of the change in density .",
    "when both components of the deflection force contribute the deflection still increases with width , but the net deflection is smaller than in the drag free case .",
    "again we determine that the largest deflections should occur for wide , slow , low mass cmes near solar minimum .",
    "forecat deflections forces result from the background solar magnetic field , @xmath111 , which we assume drapes around the cme .",
    "the precise nature of the draping of the 3d magnetic field lines onto a 2d surface is an area of open research , however , we must make some approximation to determine the deflection force .",
    "we assume that the components of the background magnetic field in the toroidal and poloidal directions remain unchanged . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] the toroidal direction , @xmath112 , parallels the long axis of the torus , and the poloidal direction , @xmath113 , is perpendicular to @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that the component in the normal direction , @xmath114 , drapes in the poloidal direction as cmes tend to be smaller in that direction relative to the toroidal direction so the background solar wind will tend to flow in the poloidal direction .",
    "we define the draped solar magnetic field , @xmath115 , at a point on the cme surface using the toroidal and poloidal coordinate system .",
    "@xmath116 we assume that as the magnetic field drapes around the cme the ratio of the toroidal to poloidal magnetic field does not change .",
    "this describes a geodesic path where the draped field line has no additional curvature beyond that of the cme surface .",
    "we determine the direction of the draped magnetic field for each grid point so that the draped magnetic field is only required to follow a geodesic path local to that grid point .",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient force , @xmath117 is defined as @xmath118 where @xmath119 represents the gradient in the direction perpendicular to @xmath120 .",

    "we then remove the component parallel to @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124    the magnetic tension force , @xmath125 is defined as @xmath126 which requires the curvature , @xmath127 , of the draped solar magnetic field lines , which we have assumed is equal to the curvature of the cme surface in the direction of the draping .",
    "we define the torus surface , @xmath128 , in terms of the toroidal and poloidal angles , @xmath129 and @xmath130 and the shape parameters @xmath8 , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 .",
