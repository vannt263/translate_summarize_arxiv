    "the study of financial markets poses many challenging questions . for example , how can one understand a strongly fluctuating system that is constantly driven by external information ? and , how can one account for the role of the feedback between the markets and the outside world , or of the complex interactions between traders and assets ?",
    "an advantage for the researcher trying to answer these questions is the availability of huge amounts of data for analysis .",
    "indeed , the activities at financial markets result in several observables , such as the values of different market indices , the prices of the different stocks , trading volumes , etc .    some of the most widely studied market observables are the values of market indices .",
    "previous empirical studies   show that the distribution of fluctuations measured by the returns of market indices has slow decaying tails and that the distributions apparently retain the same functional form for a range of time scales  @xcite . fluctuations in market indices reflect average behavior of the price fluctuations of the companies comprising them .",
    "for example , the s&p 500 is defined as the sum of the market capitalizations ( stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares ) of 500 companies representative of the us economy .    here , we focus on a more `` microscopic '' quantity : individual companies .",
    "we analyze the tic - by - tic data  @xcite for the 1000 publicly - traded us companies with the largest market capitalizations and systematically study the statistical properties of their stock price fluctuations .",
    "a preliminary study  @xcite reported that the distribution of the 5@xmath2min returns for 1000 individual companies and the s&p 500 index decays as a power - law with an exponent @xmath7 well outside the stable lvy regime ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "earlier independent studies on individual stock returns on longer time scales yield similar results  @xcite .",
    "these findings raise the following questions :    first , how does the nature of the distribution of individual stock returns change with increasing time scale @xmath0 ?",
    "in other words , does the distribution retain its power - law functional form for longer time scales , or does it converge to a gaussian , as found for market indices  @xcite ? if the distribution indeed converges to gaussian behavior , how fast does this convergence occur ? for the s&p 500 index , for example ,",
    "one finds the distribution of returns to be consistent with a _ non - stable _ power - law functional form ( @xmath9 ) until approximately 4  days , after which an onset of convergence to gaussian behavior is found  @xcite .",
    "second , why is it that the distribution of returns for individual companies and for the s&p 500 index have the same asymptotic form ?",
    "this finding is unexpected , since the returns of the s&p 500 are the weighted sums of the returns of 500 companies .",
    "hence , we would expect the s&p 500 returns to be distributed approximately as a gaussian , unless there were significant dependencies between the returns of different companies which prevent the central limit theorem from applying .    to answer the first question , we extend previous work@xcite on the distribution of returns for 5 min returns by performing empirical analysis of individual company returns for time scales up to 46  months .",
    "our analysis uses two distinct data - bases detailed below .",
    "we find that the cumulative distribution of individual - company returns is consistent with a power - law asymptotic behavior with exponent @xmath9 , which is outside the stable lvy regime .",
    "we also find that these distributions appear to retain the same functional form for time scales up to approximately 16  days .",
    "for longer time scales , we observe results consistent with a slow convergence to gaussian behavior .    to answer the second question ,",
    "we randomize each of the 500 time series of returns for the constituent 500 stocks of the s&p 500 index .",
    "a surrogate `` index return '' thus constructed from the randomized time series , shows fast convergence to gaussian .",
    "further , we find that the functional form of the distribution of returns remains unchanged for different system sizes ( measured by the market capitalization ) while the standard deviation decays as a power - law of market capitalization .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii describes the databases studied and the data analyzed .",
    "sections iii , iv , and v present results for the distribution of returns for individual companies for a wide range of time scales .",
    "section vi discusses the role of cross - correlations between companies and possible reasons why market indices have statistical properties very similar to those of individual companies .",
    "section vii contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we analyze two different databases covering securities from the three major us stock markets , namely ( i ) the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , ( ii ) the american stock exchange ( amex ) , and ( iii ) the national association of securities dealers automated quotation ( nasdaq ) stock market .",
    "nyse is the oldest stock exchange , tracing its origin to the buttonwood agreement of 1792@xcite .",
    "the nyse is an agency auction market , that is , trading at the nyse takes place by open bids and offers by exchange members , acting as agents for institutions or individual investors .",
    "buy and sell orders are brought to the trading floor , and prices are determined by the interplay of supply and demand . as of the end of november 1998 , the nyse lists over 3,100 companies .",
    "these companies have over @xmath10 shares , worth approximately usd  @xmath11 , available for trading on the exchange .",
    "in contrast to nyse , nasdaq uses computers and telecommunications networks which create an electronic trading system wherein the market participants meet over the computer rather than face to face .",
    "nasdaq s share volume reached @xmath12 shares in 1997 and dollar volume reached usd  @xmath13 .",
    "as of december 1998 , the nasdaq stock market listed over 5,400 us and non - us companies@xcite .",
    "nasdaq and amex , have merged on october 1998 , after the end of the period studied in this work .",
    "the first database we consider is the trades and quotes ( taq ) database@xcite , for which we analyze the 2-year period january 1994 to december 1995 .",
    "the taq database , which is published by nyse since 1993 , covers _ all _ trades at the three major us stock markets .",
    "this huge database is available in the form of cd - roms .",
    "the rate of publication was 1 cd - rom per month for the period studied , but recently has increased to 23 cd - roms per month .",
    "the total number of transactions for the largest 1000 stocks is of the order of @xmath14 in the 2-year period studied .",
    "the second database we analyze is the center for research and security prices ( crsp ) database@xcite .",
    "the crsp stock files cover common stocks listed on nyse beginning in 1925 , the amex beginning in 1962 , and the nasdaq stock market beginning in 1972 .",
    "the files provide complete historical descriptive information and market data including comprehensive distribution information , high , low and closing prices , trading volumes , shares outstanding , and total returns@xcite .",
    "the crsp stock files provide monthly data for nyse beginning december 1925 and daily data beginning july 1962 . for the amex ,",
    "both monthly and daily data begin in july 1962 . for the nasdaq stock market ,",
    "both monthly and daily data begin in july 1972 .",
    "we also analyze the s&p 500 index , which comprises 500 companies chosen for market size , liquidity , and industry group representation in the us . in our study , we analyze data with a recording frequency of less than 1  min that cover the 13 years from january 1984 to december 1996 .",
    "the total number of data points in this 13-year period exceeds @xmath15 .",
    "the basic quantity studied for individual companies  @xmath17  is the market capitalization @xmath18 , defined as the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares .",
    "the time @xmath19 runs over the working hours of the stock exchange  removing nights , weekends and holidays@xcite . for each company",
    ", we analyze the return    @xmath20    for small changes in @xmath18 , the return @xmath21 is approximately the forward relative change , @xmath22 for time scales shorter than 1  day , we analyze the data from the taq database .",
    "we consider the largest 1000 companies@xcite , in decreasing order of values of their market capitalization on the first trading day , 3 january 1994 .",
    "we sample the price of these 1000 companies at 5@xmath2min intervals@xcite . in order to obtain time series for market capitalization ,",
    "we multiply the stock price of each company by the number of outstanding shares for that company at each sampling time .",
    "we thereby generate a time series , sampled at 5  min intervals , for the market capitalizations of each of the largest 1000 companies .",
    "each of the 1000 time series has approximately 40,000 data points  corresponding to the number of 5  min intervals in the 2-year period  or about 40 million data points in total . for each time series of market capitalizations , we compute the 5  min returns using eq .",
    "( [ return ] ) .",
    "we filter the data to remove spurious events , such as occur due to the inevitable recording errors@xcite .",
    "figure  [ taq](a ) shows the cumulative distributions of returns @xmath24 for @xmath23  min  the probability of a return larger than or equal to a threshold  for 10 individual companies randomly selected from the 1000 companies that we analyze . for each company @xmath25 , the asymptotic behavior of the functional form of the cumulative distribution",
    "is `` visually '' consistent with a power - law , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the exponent characterizing the power - law decay . in fig .",

    "the histogram has most probable value @xmath28 .",
    "next , we compute the time - averaged volatility @xmath29 of company @xmath25 as the standard deviation of the returns over the 2-year period @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a time average over the 40,000 data points of each time series , for the 2-year period studied .",
    "figure  [ taq](a ) suggests that the widths of the individual distributions differ for different companies ; indeed , companies with small values of market capitalization are likely to fluctuate more . in order to compare the returns of different companies with different volatilities , we define the normalized return @xmath32 as @xmath33 figure  [ taq](c ) shows the ten cumulative distributions of the normalized returns @xmath34 for the same ten companies as in fig  [ taq](a ) .",

    "extrapolation of the linear regression lines yield : @xmath47      the next logical step would be to extend the previous procedure to time scales longer than 5  min .",
    "however , this approach leads to unreliable results , the reason being that the estimate of the time averaged volatility  used to define the normalized returns of eq .",
    "( [ eq_defg])has estimation errors that increase with @xmath49 . for the distribution of 5  min returns , the previous procedure relies on 40,000 data points per company for the estimation of the time averaged volatility . for 500",
    "min returns the number of data points available is reduced to 400 per company which leads to a much larger error in the estimate of @xmath50 .    to circumvent the difficulty arising from the large uncertainty in @xmath50 , we use an alternative procedure for estimating the volatility@xcite which relies on two observations .",
    "the first is that volatility decreases with market capitalization [ fig .",
    "[ varsize ] ] .",
    "the second is that companies with similar market capitalization typically have similar volatilities .",
    "based on these observations , we make the hypothesis that the market capitalization is the most influential factor in determining the volatility , @xmath51 hence , we group the returns of all the companies into `` bins '' according to the market capitalization of each company at the beginning of the interval for which the return is computed .",
    "we then compute the conditional probability of the @xmath0 returns for each of the bins of market capitalization .",

    "the scaling of the distribution of returns for individual companies is consistent with previous results for the distribution of the s&p 500 index returns  @xcite .",
    "the estimates of the exponent @xmath40 from power - law regression fits to the cumulative distribution and from the hill estimator are listed in table  [ alpha.exp ] .      in the preceding subsection we reported that the distribution of returns retains the same functional form for 5  min@xmath64 1  day .",
    "we can further test this scaling behavior by analyzing the moments of the distribution of normalized returns @xmath44 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes an average over all the normalized returns for all the bins . since @xmath9",

    "the moments do not vary significantly for the above time scales , thus confirming the scaling behavior of the distribution observed in fig  [ chk_taq](b ) .",
    "for time scales of 1@xmath2day or longer , we analyze data from the crsp database .",
    "we analyze approximately @xmath71 daily records for about 16,000 companies for the 35-year period 1962 - 96 . we expect the market capitalization of a company to change dramatically in such a long period of time .",
    "further , we expect small companies to be more volatile than large companies .",
    "hence , large changes that might occur in the market capitalization of a company will lead to large changes on its average volatility . to control for these changes in market capitalization ,",
    "we adopt the method that was used in the previous subsection for @xmath72 5  min .",
    "thus , we compute the cumulative conditional probability @xmath73 that the return @xmath74 is greater than @xmath75 , for a given bin of average market capitalization @xmath53 . we first divide the entire range of @xmath53 into bins of uniform length in logarithmic scale .",

    "in this section we address the second question that we posed initially .",
    "that is , why is it that the distribution of returns for individual companies and for the s&p 500 index have the same asymptotic form ? in the previous sections , we presented evidence that the distribution of returns scales for a wide range of time intervals . in a previous study  @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that this scaling behavior is possibly due to time dependencies , in particular , volatility correlations .",
    "next , we will show that as the time correlations lead to the time scaling of the distributions of returns , so do cross correlations among different companies lead to a functional form of the distribution of returns of indices similar to that for single companies .",
    "a direct way of analyzing the cross - correlations is by computing the cross - correlation matrix  @xcite . here",

    "the distributions show the same power - law behavior for @xmath88 .",

    "the distribution changes with @xmath94 , and approaches a gaussian shape for large @xmath94 , which indicates that the scaling in fig .",
    "[ xcorr](a ) is caused by non - trivial dependencies between different companies .",
