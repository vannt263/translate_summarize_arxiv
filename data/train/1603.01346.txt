    "the study of newton - okounkov convex bodies is started by okounkov in order to study multiplicity functions for representations of a reductive group ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and afterward developed independently by kaveh - khovanskii ( @xcite ) and by lazarsfeld - mustata ( @xcite ) .",
    "these convex bodies generalize newton polytopes for toric varieties to arbitrary projective varieties , and have various kinds of information about corresponding projective varieties ; for instance , we can systematically construct a series of toric degenerations ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.14 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) ) .",
    "hence it is important to describe the explicit form of a newton - okounkov convex body . as an application of our main result below",
    ", we obtain a series of examples , in which a newton - okounkov convex body is given by a system of explicit affine inequalities .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the theory of newton - okounkov convex bodies of schubert varieties and bott - samelson varieties is deeply connected with representation theory .",
    "for instance , kaveh ( @xcite ) proved that the newton - okounkov convex body of a schubert variety with respect to a specific valuation is identical to the littelmann string polytope constructed from the string parameterization for a demazure crystal .",
    "furthermore , one of the authors ( @xcite ) extended this result of kaveh to bott - samelson varieties . also , the feigin - fourier - littelmann - vinberg polytopes are examples of newton - okounkov convex bodies ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to realize the newton - okounkov convex body of a schubert variety with respect to a specific valuation as the nakashima - zelevinsky polyhedral realization of a demazure crystal .    to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath1 be a connected , simply - connected semisimple algebraic group over @xmath2 , @xmath3 its lie algebra , @xmath4 the weyl group , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the chevalley generators , where @xmath7 denotes an index set for the vertices of the dynkin diagram .",
