    "have been shown to behave under appropriate conditions much like moving mirrors @xcite . following these developments",
    ", cavity optomechanics is rapidly becoming a very active sub - field of fundamental and applied research at the boundary between amo physics , condensed matter physics , and nanoscience .",
    "cavity optomechanics presents considerable promise both in opening the way to address fundamental questions related to pushing quantum mechanics toward increasingly macroscopic systems , but also in applications that span a variety of areas from quantum detection to the coherent control of microscopic atomic and molecular systems and/or of nanoscale devices .",
    "specific examples include nanomechanical cantilevers coupled to a bose - einstein condensate @xcite or to dipolar molecules @xcite , to a single atom @xcite , oscillating mirrors coupled to atomic vapors @xcite , magnetized resonator tip to color center of diamond @xcite .",
    "cold atoms can probe the state of the nanostructure , or conversely , the optomechanical cavity setup can serve as a diagnostic tool for the quantum state of atoms trapped inside the resonator @xcite . on a more applied side",
    "such systems will enable the development of ultrasensitive force sensors and may find applications in quantum information processing technology .    in recent work we studied the many - body state of ultracold bosons in a bistable optical lattice potential in an optomechanical resonator .",
    "we considered explicitly the weak - coupling limit where the coupling between the cavity - field and the movable mirror results in a bistable optical lattice potential for the atoms , and showed how such a cavity plus cold - atom system can be engineered so that a superfluid and a mott insulator phase are bistable ground states for the ultracold atomic gas @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends this study to consider the dynamics of the transition between these two states as the optical potential undergoes a bistable loop . a time - dependent variational principle combined with a gutzwiller ansatz",
    "are introduced to calculate the evolution of the quantum many - body state as a super - gaussian incident light pulse @xcite switches the intracavity optical field .",
    "we discuss conditions under which this process can proceed adiabatically , and identify experimental parameters that would permit to test our predictions .",
    "section ii reviews our model of a quantum - degenerate bose gas confined by the standing wave generated in a fabry - prot cavity with one movable end mirror , and briefly reviews its steady - state properties .",
    "section iii introduces an effective potential description of the system and comments on the conditions required for an adiabatic evolution of the atoms .",
    "it then turns to the time evolution of the superfluid order parameter during the bistable superfluid to mott insulator transition .",
    "finally , section iv is a conclusion and outlook .",
    "we consider a fabry - prot cavity with one fixed end mirror and the other one , of mass @xmath0 , mounted on a spring of frequency @xmath1 and damping rate @xmath2 .",
    "an optical field @xmath3 of frequency @xmath4 is incident on the fixed mirror .",
    "the reflectivity of both mirrors is @xmath5 , with @xmath6 so that the intracavity field can be approximated by a standing wave of amplitude @xmath7 . in the absence of that field",

    "a sample of ultracold bosonic two - level atoms with transition frequency @xmath10 is loaded inside the optical lattice formed by the standing wave , and the atoms are assumed to interact with the light field in the weak coupling regime @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of atoms , @xmath13 is the single - photon atom - field coupling strength , @xmath14 is the cavity decay rate , and @xmath15 is the atom - field detuning @xcite . in this limit",
    "the intracavity field has no significant dependence on the atomic distribution and we can investigate the dynamics of the intracavity field by using the theory of an empty cavity . in this paper",
    "we describe both the light field and the movable mirror as classical objects , while the center - of - mass motion of the atoms is quantum mechanical .",
    "the extension to mirrors cooled near their quantum mechanical ground state of vibration will be considered in future work .    .",

    "equations   and are coupled through the cavity - pump detuning since the cavity frequency is @xmath25-dependent , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the integer associated with the mode closest to the laser frequency in the single - mode theory considered here .",
    "the approximate equality assumes that the mirror displacement due to radiation pressure is small compared to both @xmath9 and to the cavity mode wavelength @xmath28 .",

    "the quantum - degenerate atomic sample , assumed to be at zero temperature is trapped in the optical lattice along cavity axis , its transverse motion being strongly confined by a strong transverse potential .",
    "its hamiltonian can be then approximated as the one - dimensional form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the schrdinger field operator , @xmath46 is the two - body interaction coefficient , @xmath47 is the atomic mass and @xmath48 is the depth of the optical potential . in the tight - binding approximation",

    "finally @xmath54 is the inter - site tunneling matrix element and @xmath55 is the pair interaction energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be evaluated by expanding the field operators on the wannier basis of the lowest bloch band , and then evaluating the pertinent integrals @xcite .    setting the time - derivatives to zero yields the steady - state solution @xmath56 eliminating the equilibrium displacement @xmath57 in these equations results in a transcendental equation for the intracavity field intensity @xmath58",

    "the steady - state position of the mirror is likewise bistable.,width=302 ]    as is well known , the ground state of the atomic system is determined by the ratio @xmath67 which can be controlled by varying the lattice depth @xmath68 . for a shallow potential",
    ", interwell tunneling dominates and the many - body ground state is a superfluid , while for a deep enough potential on - site interactions dominate and the atoms enter the mott - insulator phase with integral filling factor @xcite . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ bisx ] indicates the critical depth @xmath68 at which the superfluid - mott insulator phase transition occurs , for sodium atoms trapped by a laser of wavelength @xmath69 .",
    "of particular interest is the bistable region where the shallow lower branch corresponds to a superfluid phase and the deeper upper branch to a mott insulator phase .",
    "the next section discusses the dynamics of the transition between these two phases as the optical field is varied along the bistable loop .",
    "three important time scales are relevant in understanding the dynamics of the system : the characteristic time @xmath29 of the mirror , the cavity buildup time @xmath70 , and the interwell tunneling time @xmath71 of the atoms . in the weak coupling limit",
    "the dynamics of the cavity system ( the light field plus the movable mirror ) is determined by the former two .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a bad cavity the dynamics of the light field is much faster than that of the movable mirror , @xmath72 , so that it can adiabatically follow the instantaneous displacement of the movable mirror .",
    "note that this approximation neglects the non - adiabatic effects that lead to optical damping , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this paper treats the motion of the moving mirror classically as it is not concerned with the dynamics of mirror cooling .",
    "we therefore ignore optical damping in the following , and adiabatically eliminate the optical field in the eq .  , resulting in the nonlinear oscillator equation @xmath73    to further analyze the dynamics of this nonlinear oscillator we introduce the effective potential @xcite @xmath74 where the first term corresponds to the restoring force on the movable mirror and the second to the radiation pressure force .",

    "[ poten](a ) the potential has a single minimum , but increasing it sees the appearance of a second local minimum , fig .",
    "[ poten](b ) , indicative of bistability .",
    "further increasing the input intensity past the bistable region the initial minimum disappears as expected , see fig .",

    "the two dashed lines label the critical intensities at the beginning and the end of the bistable region .",
    "( b ) evolution of the intracavity intensity @xmath79 controlled by @xmath80 .",
    "here @xmath81 and the other parameters are as in fig .  2 . the dotted line labels the critical depth of the atomic phase transition.,width=340 ]    for concreteness we assume in the following that the optical field incident on the fabry - prot is a super - gaussian pulse , fig .  [ dynam](a ) .",
    "since the intracavity field is assumed to follow the motion of the mirror adiabatically , this readily yields the time - dependent optical potential @xmath82    figure  [ dynam](b ) illustrates the dynamics of the intracavity intensity as the incident intensity is varied to switch the system from the lower to the upper bistability branch and back . in this example",
    "@xmath83 is initially switched to a value only slightly above the critical value @xmath84 where the first local minimum of the effective potential degenerates into a plateau , hence it takes a relatively long time to switch to its new steady - state value . under appropriate circumstances",
    "this critical slowing down @xcite can be exploited to allow the atoms to adiabatically follow the potential changes in the superfluid region , see below . following that slow evolution stage",
    ", @xmath85 grows nearly exponentially as the mirror falls into the newly formed potential well and completes its transition to the upper branch . for the switch back to the lower branch shown in this example ,",
    "the lower value of @xmath83 is chosen to be significantly below @xmath86 , so as to reduce the effects of critical slowing down . as expected",
    ", @xmath85 then switches much faster to the lower branch .    the time dependence of the potential @xmath85 results in wannier functions that are likewise time - dependent , and hence also in time - dependent tunneling rate @xmath87 and on - site interaction @xmath88 .",
    "in order for the many - body ground state of the atoms to follow adiabatically the changes in potential , two requirements must be fulfilled .",
    "the first one is that the variation of the potential depth must be slow enough to prevent the occurrence of inter - band excitations , that is the atoms must remain in the first bloch band at all times . this condition is usually easy to satisfy for atoms with quasi - momentum @xmath89 because of the existence of a band gap @xcite .",
    "the explicit adiabaticity criterion is @xmath90 we note that for the experimental parameters considered here this condition is satisfied for even the fastest transients in fig .",
    "4(b ) : the maximum value reached by @xmath91 is @xmath92 which is much less than @xmath93 .",
    "we therefore assume in the following that that inter - band excitations are negligible , and evaluate @xmath94 and @xmath95 with wannier functions of the first band .",
    "in addition to this single - particle adiabaticity condition , we also need to consider the time scale associated with many - body effects . as the potential depth varies in time",
    ", the atoms need a sufficient amount of time to tunnel and redistribute themselves across the lattice , and hence to settle in their new ground state  think specifically of a transition between a mott insulator and a superfluid .",
    "although this is not a significant consideration if the atoms remain in the mott insulator phase , which is quite insensitive to inter - well rearrangement , it is more important in the superfluid region , due to the variation of the tunneling rate @xmath94@xcite .",
    "that is the reason why the critical slowing down can be useful in controlling the variation of the potential in the superfluid region . whether or not the second adiabaticity condition is satisfied can be determined from the time - dependent order parameter which we calculate next .",
    "the evolution of the atomic ground state can be obtained from the time - dependent variational principle @xcite , @xmath96 where the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath97 depends on time via the coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and @xmath98 is taken to be given by the time - dependent mean - field gutzwiller ansatz @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath101 are fock states , and @xmath102 are probability amplitudes that preserves the normalization of the wave function .",
    "we assume that the lattice is uniform with unit filling factor and insert the gutzwiller ansatz into eq .  .",
    "this yields the set of coupled nonlinear equations for the amplitudes @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the atomic superfluid order parameter .",
    "our numerical results are for an initial optical potential depth of 5@xmath32 , for which the tight binding approximation is valid and the many - body ground state is superfluid .     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath36 .",
    "the dotted line indicates the critical value @xmath106 , corresponding to the potential depth @xmath107 for our parameters , for the superfluid and to mott insulator phase transition .",
    "( b ) dynamics of the superfluid order parameter @xmath108 during the transition from the superfluid to the mott insulator and back to the superfluid . here",
    "@xmath109 nm and @xmath110khz for @xmath111na . the mass and vibration frequency of the mirror are @xmath112 g and @xmath113hz , respectively . in real units , the full cycle through the bistable loop takes @xmath114s .",
    "( c ) same as ( b ) but for @xmath115 g and @xmath116hz , width=377 ]    figure  [ bisphase](a ) shows the ratio @xmath117 as a function of time .",
    "the transition between the superfluid and mott insulator phases is clearly shown by the absolute value of the superfluid order parameter @xmath118 plotted in fig .",
    "[ bisphase](b ) . as the ratio @xmath119 decreases below the critical value @xmath120 , corresponding to the critical potential depth @xmath121 for sodium atoms , the order parameter rapidly drops to zero , indicating that the atoms enter the mott insulator phase .",
    "when @xmath119 rises back above that critical value , the order parameter recovers a non - zero value , indicative of the return of the atoms to the superfluid phase .",
    "the small oscillations of the order parameter in the mott - insulator region are due to collapses and revivals of the condensate with period @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the oscillations following the return of the system to the superfluid region were first predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite . they result from a rapid transition of the system from being a mott insulator to a superfluid , and can be suppressed via a slower variation of potential depth .",
    "the small amplitude of these oscillations , less than 5 percent of the initial value of the order parameter , indicates that the second adiabatic condition ( associated with tunneling ) is well satisfied in this example .    for comparison fig .",
    "5(c ) shows the time - dependent superfluid order parameter for a situation here non - adiabatic effects are more apparent . in this case the mass and vibration frequency of the mirror have been changed to 0.031 g and @xmath123hz . since these parameters give the same steady - state solutions as fig .  2 ,",
    "the form of the evolution of the intracavity intensity is unchanged , but it occurs now on a shorter time scale .",
    "the cycle through the bistable loop takes now 0.5s in real units , five times faster than the case of fig .",
    "although the first adiabatic condition is still satisfied for these parameters , it is apparent from fig .",
    "5(c ) that the amplitude of the oscillations in both the mott insulator and the superfluid regions is much larger than in fig .",
    "5(b ) an indication of the breakdown of the second adiabatic condition .",
    "we conclude by remarking that the finite temperature of the classical mirror leads to thermal position fluctuations @xmath124 which result in turn in fluctuations for the intracavity field strength the lattice potential depth @xmath125 . in order to prevent this effect",
    "we request that @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the minimum value of the potential depth during the switching process .",
    "this inequality gives a mirror temperature limit of @xmath128 .",
    "we have analyzed the dynamics of a quantum - degenerate ultracold sample of bosonic atoms trapped in the optical lattice of a bistable optomechanical system .",
    "the variation of intracavity optical lattice depth results in a bistable quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a mott - insulator ground state .",
    "we considered the concrete case of a super - gaussian incident light pulse to drive the atomic system around the bistable loop , and found that the critical slowing down of the optomechanical system can be useful to prevent the excitation of the atoms in a potential ramping - up stage .",
    "our numerical results indicate that the bistable superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition should be realizable for realistic experimental parameters .",
    "future work will extend these studies to the strong - coupling regime , where the optical field depends on the motion of the cold atoms as well as the mirror .",
    "we will also investigate to which extent the mirror can serve as a measurement device to observe the dynamics of a quantum phase transition nondestructively , in particular in cases where it is cooled to near its quantum mechanical ground state of vibration , additional goals include the study of the optically induced quantum correlations and entanglement between the ultracold atomic system and the mirror , the quantum control of the mirror motion by the atoms , and conversely of the atoms by the nanomechanical system , and finally the development of novel types of quantum sensors .",
