    "in this paper , we are interested in the connections between the principle eigenfunctions of the koopman operator associated with a diffeomorphism of a banach space with an asymptotically stable , hyperbolic fixed point and the existence of a topological conjugacy between the diffeomorphism and its linearization around the fixed point .",
    "as long as the principle eigenvalues satisfy the standard non - resonance conditions ( see @xcite ) of normal form theory , the principle eigenfunctions generate a commutative algebra of polynomials from which a sequence of coordinate transformations that linearizes the diffeomorphism can be generated . more specifically , if @xmath0 is the generated algebra and @xmath1 is the diffeomorphism , then there are banach - valued polynomials @xmath2 in @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fixed point and @xmath6 is a power series around @xmath5 such that @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "our interest in this connection arose when investigating the construction of spaces of observables for nonlinear dissipative dynamics , each element of which has an expansion into eigenfunctions of the associated koopman operator .",
    "the procedure for constructing such spaces is straight forward and proceeds by first defining a space of observables for the simpler linear dynamics .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the koopman operators associated with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and assume that we have constructed a space of observables @xmath13 for @xmath10 of which every element has an expansion into eigenfunctions . if there exists a topological conjugacy @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , then every element of the space @xmath16 has an expansion into eigenfunctions of @xmath9 .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that if @xmath17 is an eigenfunction of @xmath10 , then @xmath18 is an eigenfunction of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , getting a concrete representation of elements of @xmath19 in terms of simpler functions can be difficult due to the action of @xmath20  we know that @xmath19 and @xmath13 are isomorphic through @xmath21 , but we do not know if they are _",
    "identical_. if we can show that the two spaces are identical , or at least their uniform closures agree , then we can use the functions in @xmath13 and its uniform closure as observables for the nonlinear dynamics and still have spectral expansions for each element .    in this paper , we answer the following questions .    1",
    ".   [ question:1 ] is there a sub - algebra of @xmath22 of which every element has an expansion into eigenfunctions of @xmath10 ?",
    "[ question:2 ] similarly , is there a sub - algebra of @xmath22 of which every element has an expansion into eigenfunctions of @xmath9 ?",
    "[ question:3 ] if the above two sub - algebras exist , what is their relation ?",
    "answering , the so - called principle eigenfunction can be used to generate an algebra of observables ( called the principle algebra ) which have expansions in eigenfunctions .",
    "this algebra can be pulled back to an algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics as long as a topological conjugacy exists .",
    "this conjugacy can actually be constructed from change of variables transformations that are formed from tensor products of the principle algebra with the banach space ( question ) .",
    "the pullback algebra , formed via the topological conjugacy , also has spectral expansions since eigenfunctions are preserved when composing with topological conjugacies @xcite ( question ) .",
    "if we work on real , finite dimensional , banach spaces and look at the complexification of the linearization , the generated principle algebra separates points and is closed under complex conjugation .",
    "if we restrict the domain of the algebra to a compact neighborhood of the fixed point and appeal to the stone - weierstrass theorem , the uniform closure of the principle algebra is either the space of complex continuous functions on the compact neighborhood ( if the constant functions are appended to the algebra ) or the maximal ideal consisting of complex continuous functions which vanish at the fixed point .",
    "furthermore , if we have built the topological conjugacy @xmath21 from the linear to nonlinear dynamics , we can pull back the principle algebra of observables for the linear dynamics to an algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics by composing functions @xmath23 in the principle algebra with @xmath20 ; i.e. , elements of the algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics have the form @xmath24 . taking a compact neighborhood @xmath25 of the fixed point , the sets @xmath26 and @xmath25 are homeomorphic via the conjugacy .",
    "this implies that the pull back algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics inherits the uniform closure properties of the principle algebra of observables ; i.e. , if the uniform closure of the principle algebra of observables is the entire space of complex continuous functions on @xmath25 , then the uniform closure of the pull back algebra is the space of complex continuous functions on @xmath26 .",
    "if instead the uniform closure of the principle algebra of observables is the maximal ideal @xmath27 , then the uniform closure of the pull back algebra is the maximal ideal @xmath28 , where @xmath5 is the fixed point .",
    "one can interpret these results as saying that every continuous function is a perturbation of an observable that has an expansion into eigenfunctions of the associated koopman operator . or",
    ", if we choose a continuous function as an observable , then there is another observable arbitrarily close in the uniform norm that has a spectral expansion into koopman eigenfunctions .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we develop the framework for polynomial transformations between banach spaces and the concept of principle eigenfunctions of the koopman operator .",
    "the definition of the polynomial maps requires the introduction multilinear maps between banach spaces .",
    "we record these definitions and basic properties in section [ subsec : polynomials ] . in section [ subsec : principle - eigenfunctions ] , we define the relevant koopman operators , ( koopman ) principle eigenfunctions , the non - resonance condition on the principle eigenvalues , and the principle algebra .",
    "section [ sec : linear - nonlinear - observables ] relates the principle algebra of observables for the linearized system with an algebra of observables for the nonlinear system .",
    "this is done by constructing a sequence of approximate topological conjugacies between the linear and nonlinear dynamics using the principle algebra .",
    "the results of this section follow normal form theory closely .",
    "section [ sec : approximate - conjugacies - eigenfunctions ] relates the spectral properties of the koopman operator for the linearized system with those of the koopman operator for the nonlinear system .",
    "it is shown that if an eigenfunction for the linearized system s koopman operator is composed with the sequence of approximate topological conjugacies , then the resulting functions are approximate eigenfunctions of the koopman operator of the nonlinear system at the same eigenvalue when restricted to the open unit ball . by approximate eigenfunction , we mean a function that is order @xmath29 away from a true eigenfunction ( see ) . in section [ sec : uniform - closure - of - a ] , we restrict our banach space to be real . after going through the standard complexification process of the space and the map @xmath11",
    ", an application of the stone - weierstrass theorem gives that both the principle algebra of observables for the linear system and its pullback to the nonlinear system is either uniformly dense in the continuous functions or the maximal ideal of continuous functions that vanish at the fixed point .",

    "this paper investigated the connection between the existence of a topological conjugacy between a diffeomorphism @xmath11 and its linearization @xmath12 around an asymptotically stable fixed point and the principle eigenfunctions of the koopman operator @xmath138 .",
    "the conjugacy @xmath21 from the linear dynamics to the nonlinear dynamics is generated using principle eigenfunctions of @xmath138 .",
    "specifically , the principle koopman eigenfunctions generate an algebra @xmath0 of observables for the linear dynamics from which we can generate a sequence of approximate conjugacies @xmath388 satisfying @xmath389 .",
    "these approximate conjugacies are in @xmath3 , the space of @xmath30-valued polynomials generated by the principle eigenfunctions of @xmath138 .",
    "as long as the principle eigenfunctions are non - resonant for all orders , then this process can continue in order to get a conjugacy between the linear and nonlinear dynamics @xmath21 .",
    "the use of this connection is to generate `` good '' spaces of observables for the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we know by construction that each element in the space of observables @xmath0 for the linear dynamics has an expansion into eigenfunctions of @xmath138 .",
    "when constructing a space of observables for the nonlinear dynamics , we would also like to have this property .",
    "the question is then how to construct such a space and what relation , if any , it has to @xmath0 .    if we have built a conjugacy @xmath20 from the nonlinear dynamics to the linear dynamics , every element of the space @xmath390 has an expansion into eigenfunctions of @xmath9 .",
    "the results of this paper build @xmath21 , and ultimately @xmath20 , from a sequence of _ polynomial _ transformations @xmath285 generated from the principle koopman eigenfunctions .",
    "@xmath20 is an analytic function and for every @xmath391 , the observable @xmath392 is an analytic function generated by the principle koopman eigenfunctions .",
    "thus the koopman eigenfunctions for the linearized system generate a space of observables for the nonlinear dynamics for which every element has a spectral expansion into eigenfunctions of the koopman operator associated with the _ nonlinear _ dynamics .",
    "even if we terminate the construction of the conjugacy at a finite number of steps ( giving @xmath285 ) , we can get an approximate eigenfunction for @xmath9 which is within @xmath393 of a true eigenfunction of @xmath9 .",
    "often we work with real banach spaces and diffeomorphisms on them .",
    "if we again linearize around a fixed point and then look at the complexification , we can generate a complex algebra of functions from the principle eigenfunctions that is closed under complex conjugation and whose domain is a compact neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "appealing to the stone - weierstrass theorem allows us to make statements about the uniform closure of the principle algebra . in particular , if the constant functions have been appended to the algebra , the uniform closure of the algebra is the space of complex continuous function . on the other hand ,",
    "if we have not appended the constant functions to the principle algebra , then every element of the algebra vanishes at the fixed point , and the uniform closure of the algebra is the maximal ideal of complex continuous functions that vanishes at the fixed point .",
    "we can get an algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics by pulling back the algebra of observables for the linear dynamics using the topological conjugacy .",
    "since the spaces are homeomorphic via the conjugacy , the algebra of observables for the nonlinear dynamics inherits the uniform closure properties of the principle algebra of observables for the linear dynamics .",
    "what these results says is that if we choose a continuous observable for our system , we know that it is arbitrarily close , in the uniform norm , to an observable that has a spectral expansion . from another viewpoint , every continuous observable is a perturbation of an observable which has an expansion into koopman eigenfunctions .",
    "let @xmath394 be the @xmath395-linear map that gives @xmath396 . by assumption @xmath397 , where @xmath398 .",
