    "a minority game can be exemplified by the following simple market analogy ; an odd number @xmath1 of traders ( agents ) must at each time step choose between two options , buying or selling a share , with the aim of picking the minority group .",
    "if sell is in minority and buy in majority one may expect the price to go up to satisfy demand and vice versa if buy is in minority , thus motivating the minority character of the game .",
    "clearly , there is no way to make everyone content , at least half of the agents will inevitably end up in the majority group each round . as the losing agents will try to improve their lot",
    "there is no static equilibrium .",
    "instead , agents might be expected to adapt their buy or sell strategies based on perceived trends in the history of outcomes @xcite . the minority game proposed by zhang and challet",
    "@xcite formalizes this type of market dynamics where agents of limited intellect compete for a scarce resource by adapting to the aggregate input of all others @xcite .",
    "each agent has a set of strategies that , depending on the recent past history of minority groups going @xmath8 time steps back , gives a prediction of the next minority being buy or sell .",
    "the agent uses at each time step her highest scoring strategy which has most accurately predicted correct minority groups historically .",
    "the state space of the game is given by the strategy scores of each agent together with the recent history of minority groups , and the discrete time evolution in this space represents an intricate dynamical system .",
    "what makes the game appealing from a physics perspective is that it can be described using methods for the statistical physics of disordered systems , with the set of randomly assigned strategies corresponding to quenched disorder @xcite . in particular challet , marsili , and",
    "co - workers showed that the model can be formulated in terms of the gradient descent dynamics of an underlying hamiltonian @xcite , plus noise .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics corresponds to minimizing the hamiltonian with respect to the frequency at which agents use each strategy , a problem which in turn can be solved using the replica method @xcite . in a complementary development coolen solved the statistical dynamics of the problem in its full complexity using generating functionals @xcite .",
    "the game is controlled by the parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of distinct histories that agents take into account , which tunes the system through a phase transition ( for @xmath11 ) at a critical value @xmath12 . in the symmetric ( or crowded ) phase ,",
    "@xmath13 , the game is quasi - periodic with period @xmath14 where a given history gives alternately one or the other of the outcomes for minority group @xcite .",
    "a somewhat oversimplified characterization of the dynamics is that the information about the last winning minority group for a given history gives a crowding effect @xcite where many agents want to repeat the last winning outcome which then counterproductively instead puts them in the majority group .",
    "the crowding also gives large fluctuations of the size of the minority group .",
    "in the asymmetric ( or dilute ) phase , @xmath15 , agents are sufficiently uncorrelated that crowding effects are not important and there is no periodic behavior . instead ,",
    "as exemplified in figure [ timeseries ] the score dynamics is random but with a net correlation between agents that makes fluctuations in the size of the minority group small .",
    "the dilute occupation of the full strategy space gives rise to a non - uniform frequency distribution of histories which can be beneficial for agents with strategies that are tuned to this asymmetry .",
    "in this paper we study the dynamics of the minority game in the asymmetric phase by formulating a simplified statistical model , focusing on finding probability distributions for the relative strategy scores .",
    "in particular , we study the original formulation of the game with sign - payoff for which quantitative results are challenging to derive . by sorting the strategies based on",
    "how strongly they are correlated with the average over all strategies in the game , we find that sufficient statistical information can be extracted to formulate a quantitatively accurate model for @xmath16 .",
    "we discuss how the relative score for each agent can be derived from the master equation of a random walk on a chain with asymmetric jump probabilities to nearest neighbor sites , and how these jump probabilities can be calculated from the basic dynamic update equation of the scores .",
    "the corresponding probability distributions of scores are either of the form of exponential localization or diffusion with a drift . in the appendices",
    "we show that the model is related to but independent from the hamiltonian formulation and we show how it can also be readily applied to the game with linear payoff where the master equation has long - range hopping . +",
    "although the mg is well understood from the classic works discussed above , it is our hope that the simplified model of the steady state attendance and score distributions presented in this paper provides an alternative and readily accessible perspective on this fascinating model .",
    "in order to give an overview of our results and for completeness we start by providing the formal definition of the minority game and some basic properties @xcite .    at each discrete time step every agent gives a binary _ bid _ @xmath17 , all of which are collected into a total _ attendance _",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath1 odd ) and the winning minority group is then identified through @xmath19 .",
    "a binary string of the @xmath8 past winning bids , called a history @xmath20 , is provided as global information to each agent upon which to base her decision for the following round .",
    "there are thus @xmath21 with @xmath10 different histories . at her disposal",
    "each agent has two randomly assigned strategies ( a.k.a .",
    "strategy tables ) that provide a unique bid for each history .",
    "the bid of strategy @xmath22 of agent @xmath23 in response to history @xmath20 is given by @xmath24 and the full strategy is the @xmath2 dimensional random binary vector @xmath25 .",
    "there are thus a total of @xmath26 distinct strategies available .",
    "the agent uses at each time step the strategy that has made the best predictions for minority group historically .",
    "this is decided by a score @xmath27 for each strategy which is updated according to @xmath28 , irrespectively of the strategy actually being used or not .",
    "( here the superscript @xmath20 on @xmath29 just indicates that the attendance will depend on the history @xmath30 giving the bids at time @xmath31 . ) ties , i.e. @xmath32 , are decided by a coin toss .",
    "since it is only the relative score between an agent s two strategies that is important in deciding which strategy to use , one may focus on the relative score @xmath33 this is updated according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 and where @xmath36 is an agents `` difference vector '' that takes values @xmath37 or @xmath38 for each history @xmath20 .",
    "evolution of strategy scores for the two strategies of four ( @xmath39 ) representative agents in a game with @xmath40 agents and a memory of length @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . at each time step",
    "every agent uses the one of her two strategies which has the highest momentary score , given by how well the strategy has predicted the past minority groups .",
    "the corresponding score difference @xmath43 ( inset ) shows the distinction between frozen agents that consistently use a single strategy , and fickle agents that switch between strategies . ]    to make the dynamics generated by these equations more concrete , figure [ timeseries ] shows the scores of the strategies of four particular agents @xmath44 , @xmath45 for one realization of a game with @xmath40 , @xmath42 , together with the corresponding relative scores @xmath46 ( inset ) , over a limited time interval . as exemplified by this figure agents come in two flavors , known as  frozen  and  fickle",
    "an agent is frozen if one of her strategies performs consistently better than the other , such that on average the score difference is diverging , whereas fickle agents have a relative score that meanders around @xmath4 switching their used strategy .",
    "the motion of @xmath46 for both fickle and frozen agents is a random walk with a bias towards or away from @xmath4 .",
    "a basic problem is to characterize and understand this random walk and derive the corresponding probability distribution @xmath47 ; the probability to find agent @xmath48 at position @xmath49 at time @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "as presented in section [ model ] we can quantify the correlation between an agent s strategies , specified by @xmath50 , and the total attendance @xmath51 , which in turn allows for characterizing the mean ( time averaged ) step size @xmath52 in terms of a distribution over agents @xmath53 .",
    "in agreement with earlier work we find that @xmath54 has two contributions ; one center ( @xmath4 ) seeking bias term which arises from self interaction ( the used strategy contributes to the attendance and as such is more likely to be in the majority group @xcite ) and a fitness term which reflects the relative adaptation of the agent s two strategies to the time averaged stochastic environment of the game .",
    "the distribution of step sizes over the population of agents are shown in figure [ distribution ] where frozen agents are simply those where the fitness overcomes the bias , such that @xmath55 for @xmath56 or @xmath57 for @xmath58 , whereas for fickle agents @xmath57 for @xmath56 and vice versa .    knowing the mean step size of an agent allows for a formulation in terms of a one dimensional random walk ( fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) with corresponding jump probabilities , as presented in section [ distributions ] . depending on",
    "whether it is more likely to jump towards the center or not ( fickle or frozen respectively ) the master equation on the chain can be solved in terms of a stationary exponential distribution centered at @xmath4 or ( in the continuum limit ) a normal distribution with a variance and mean that grow linearly in time ( diffusion with drift ) .",
    "these are the distributions @xmath47 depending on @xmath54 .    in simulations over many agents",
    "it is natural to consider the full distribution @xmath59 , with @xmath60 thus the probability of finding an agent at time @xmath31 with relative score @xmath49 . in terms of scaled coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 we find that the distribution only depends on @xmath7 .",
    "the model distributions show excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ pxt ] and [ large_a ] ) with no fitting parameters .",
    "this result for the full distribution of relative scores together with its systematic derivation for the original sign - payoff game represent the main results of this paper .    in appendix [ hamiltonian ]",
    "we discuss the relation between the model presented in this work and the formulation in terms of a minimization problem of a hamiltonian generator of the asymptotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "we find that one way to view the present model is as a reduced ansatz for the ground state where the only parameters are the fraction of positively and negatively frozen agents ( solved for self - consistently ) instead of the full space of the frequency of use of each strategy .",
    "with this ansatz closed expressions can be derived for the steady state distributions irrespective of the form of the hamiltonian .    in appendix [ linearpay ]",
    "we show how the model applies to the game with linear payoff @xmath61 .",
    "we will now turn to describing the statistical model in some detail and derive the results discussed in the previous section .",
    "we define for each agent the sum and difference of strategies for each bid @xmath62 and ( as discussed above ) @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "clearly @xmath63 , being the sum of two random numbers @xmath37 is distributed over @xmath64 with probability @xmath65 .",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath63 means that agent @xmath48 always has the same bid for history @xmath20 independently of which strategy it has in play .",
    "the sum over all agents , @xmath66 , thus gives a constant history dependent but time independent background contribution to the attendance .",
    "( in the sense that every time history @xmath20 occurs in the time series it gives the same contribution . )",
    "this background @xmath67 is , for large @xmath1 , normally distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath68    an interesting property of the minority game is that there is a `` @xmath69 gauge '' freedom with respect to an arbitrary choice of which is called strategy @xmath70 and which is @xmath71 , thus corresponding to a change of sign of @xmath72 .",
    "such a sign change will simply result in a change of sign of @xmath43 having no consequence on which strategy is actually in play .",
    "( it is the strategy in play which is an observable , not whether it is labeled by 1 or 2 . )",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that making a consistent definition of the order of strategies is helpful in formulating a simple statistical model .",
    "explicitly we order the two strategies ( `` fix the gauge '' ) of all agents @xmath48 such that @xmath73 shortly we will describe the distribution over agents of @xmath50 , to quantify its anticorrelation with @xmath74 .",
    "to proceed we write the attendance at a time step @xmath31 with history @xmath20 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 depending on which strategy agent @xmath48 is playing @xcite . again , the relative strategy score @xmath46 of agent @xmath48 is updated according to eqn .",
    "[ step1 ] . given the background contribution to the attendance @xmath77 we expect there to be a surplus of @xmath78 in the steady state with our choice of gauge because the strategy 1 is expected to be favored by the score update function .",
    "( in other words , strategy 1 is expected to have a higher fitness . ) however , this correlation is not trivial as the accumulated score also depends on the dynamically generated contribution the attendance .",
    "as discussed previously some fraction @xmath79 of the agents are frozen , in the sense of always using the same strategy , @xmath80 .",
    "we make an additional distinction ( made significant by our choice of gauge ) and separate the group of frozen agents into those with @xmath81 ( fraction @xmath82 ) , and those with @xmath83 ( fraction @xmath84 ) , such that @xmath85 .",
    "clearly , we expect the former to be more plentiful than the latter .",
    "we will now derive steady state distributions over agents for the mean step size @xmath54 .",
    "for this purpose we will write the attendance as @xmath86 where @xmath87 corresponding to the three categories of agents discussed previously .",
    "we will make the following simplifying approximations for these three components : the fickle component we will model as completely disordered , such that @xmath76 is random , and correspondingly ( for large n ) @xmath88 is normally distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath89 with @xmath90 the fraction of fickle agents .",
    "( thus , neglecting that the fickle agents would also have a net anticorrelation with the background @xmath77 )",
    ". we will assume the frozen agents to simply be a sum of independent random variables drawn from the distribution of @xmath91 , thus neglecting that the agents that are frozen may come from the extremes of this distribution .",
    "to proceed , we need to find the distribution of @xmath72 , i.e. how it varies over the set of agents .",
    "( henceforth we will usually drop the index @xmath48 and regard the objects as drawn from a distribution . )",
    "begin by defining @xmath92 , which is thus disordered with respect to the sign of @xmath93 .",
    "is what is called @xmath94 in the literature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we reserve @xmath94 for the object where strategies are ordered such that @xmath95 , corresponding to @xmath96 . ]",
    "the object @xmath97 is independent of @xmath67 ( ignoring @xmath98 corrections due to @xmath99 limiting the available bids @xmath37 ) , taking values @xmath100 with probability @xmath65 , which gives mean zero and variance @xmath101 . consider the joint object @xmath102 , for large @xmath2 this becomes normally distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "now , to quantify the correlation between @xmath91 and @xmath77 we define the object @xmath104 which consequently has mean @xmath105 and @xmath106",
    ". we will represent this distribution by assuming that each component @xmath107 are independent gaussian random variables with a mean that is linearly dependent on @xmath67 . with this assumption",
    "we find the conditional distribution @xmath108 where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , and where we write the normal distribution over @xmath49 with mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath111 as @xmath112 .",
    "this quantifies that @xmath107 is on average anticorrelated with @xmath67 which is expected to place strategy 1 in the minority group more often than strategy 2 .    using eqn .",

    "( the factor @xmath122 in the delta function is to account for the fact that the attendance , as defined in eqn [ attendance ] , changes in steps of two and the factor @xmath123 comes from the fact that only the used strategy enters the attendance . )",

    "we will assume that histories occur with the same frequency such that @xmath127 .",
    "this is in fact not the case for a single realization of the game in the dilute phase , some histories occur more often than others , as one can see directly from any simulation in this regime .",
    "nevertheless , for large @xmath2 we will assume that this variation of occurrences of @xmath20 averages out . as discussed extensively in the literature",
    "the overall behavior of the game is insensitive to whether the actual history is used ( endogenous information ) as input to the agents or if a random history is supplied ( exogenous information ) @xcite .",
    "this is also confirmed by the present work through the good agreement between the model using exogenous information and simulations in which we use the actual history .",

    "the only appreciable contribution to the variance comes from the fitness term scaling as @xmath138 whereas the bias has a variance that scales with @xmath139 and thus negligible ( as is the cross term ) .",
    "the variance can be written @xmath140 where @xmath141 also changes slowly in the relevant regime ( fig .",
    "[ changes ] ) and satisfies @xmath142 .",
    "the width of the fitness distribution explains the fact that even though @xmath143 consistent with @xmath144 , there are also some agents with a large negative fitness which implies @xmath145 . the fact that @xmath146 thus does not necessarily imply that strategy @xmath70 is more successful than strategy @xmath71 as the correlation with the other frozen agents is also an important factor",
    ". for large @xmath7 , both the mean and variance of the fitness vanish , as can be understood as a result of there being too few agents compared to the number of possible outcomes to maintain any appreciable correlation between an agents strategies and the aggregate background , @xmath147 . in this limit , since the bias term always penalizes the used strategy there can be no frozen agents .",
