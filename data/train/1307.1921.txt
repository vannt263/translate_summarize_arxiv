    "a conventional boundary layer theory of fluid flow used for free convective description assumes zero velocity at leading edge of a heated plate .",
    "more advanced  theories of self - similarity also accept this same boundary condition @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however experimental visualization definitely shows that in the vicinity of edge the fluid motion exists sb , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is obvious from the point of view of the mass conservation law . in the mentioned convection descriptions the continuity equation",
    "is not taken into account that diminishes the number of necessary variables .",
    "for example the pressure is excluded by cross differentiation of navier - stokes equation component .",
    "the consequence of zero value of boundary layer thickness at the leading edge of the plate yields in infinite value of heat transfer coefficient which is in contradiction with the physical fact that the plate do not transfer a heat at the starting point of the phenomenon .",
    "the whole picture of the phenomenon is well known : the profiles of velocity and temperature in normal direction to a vertical plate is reproduced by theoretical concepts of prandtl and self-similarity.while the evolution of profiles along tangent coordinate do not look as given by visualisation of isotherms ( see e.g. gdp ) .",
    "it is obvious that isotherms dependance on vertical coordinate @xmath1 significantly differs from power low depandance @xmath3 of boundary layer theories .    in this article",
    "we develop the model of convective heat transfer taking into account nonzero fluid motion at the vicinity of the starting edge .",
    "our model is based on explicit form of solution of the basic fundamental equations ( navier - stokes and fourier - kirchhoff )  as a power series in dependant variables .",
    "the mass conservation law in integral form is used to formulate a boundary condition that links initial and final edges of the fluid flow .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional free convective fluid flow in @xmath4 plane generated by vertical isothermal plate of height @xmath2 placed in udisturbed surrounding .",
    "the algorithm of solution construction is following .",
    "first we expand the basic fields , velocity and temperature in power serious of horizontal variable @xmath0 , it substitution into the basic system gives a system of ordinary differential equations in @xmath1 variable .",
    "such system is generally infinite therefore we should cut the expansion at some power .",
    "the form of such cutting defines a model .",
    "the minimal number of term in the modeling is determined by the physical conditions of velocity and temperature profiles . from the scale analysis of the equations we neglect the horizontal ( normal to the surface of the plate ) component velocity .",
    "the minimum number of therms is chosen as three : the parabolic part guarantee a maximum of velocity existence while the third therm account gives us change of sign of the velocity derivative .",
    "the temperature behavior in the same order of approximation is defined by the basic system of equations .    the first term in such expansion is linear in @xmath0 , that account boundary condition on the plate ( isothermic one ) .",
    "the coefficient , noted as @xmath5 satisfy an ordinary differential equation of the fourth order .",
    "it means that we need four boundary condition in @xmath1 variable .",
    "the differential links of other coefficients with @xmath6 add two constants of integrations hence a necessity of two extra conditions .",
    "these conditions are derived from conservation laws in integral form .",
    "the solution of the basic system , however , need one more constant choice .",
    "this constant characterize linear term of velocity expansion and evaluated by means of extra boundary condition .    in the second section we present basic system in dimensional and dimensionless forms . by means of cross - differentiation",
    "we eliminate the pressure therm and next neglect the horizontal velocity that results in two partial differential equations for temperature and vertical component of velocity .    in the third section",
    "we expand both velocity and temperature fields into taylor series in @xmath0 and derive ordinary differential equations for the coefficients by direct substitution into basic system .",
    "the minimal ( cubic ) version is obtained disconnecting the infinite system of equations by the special constraint .",
    "the fourth and fives sections are devoted to boundary condition formulations and its explicit form in therms of the coefficient functions of basic fields .",
    "it is important to stress that the set of boundary conditions and conservation laws determine all necessary parameters including the grasshof anf rayleigh numbers in the stationary regime under consideration .",
    "the last section contains the solution @xmath5 in explicit form and results of its numerical analysis .",
    "the solution parameters values as the function of the plate height @xmath2 and parameters whivh enter the grasshof number @xmath7 estimation are given in the table form , which allows to fix a narrow domain of the scale parameter @xmath8 being the characteristic linear dimension of the flow at the starting level .",
    "let us consider a two dimensional stationary flow of incompressible fluid in the gravity field .",
    "the flow is generated by a convective heat transfer from solid plate to the fluid .",
    "the plate is isothermal and vertical . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates @xmath0 ( horizontal and orthogonal to the palte)@xmath9 ( vertical and tangent to the palte ) the navier - stokes ( ns ) system of equations have the form @xcite.:@xmath10@xmath11    in the above equations the pressure terms are divided in two parts @xmath12 .",
    "the first of them is the hydrostatic one that is equal to mass force @xmath13 , where :    @xmath14    is the density of a liquid at the nondisturbed area where the temperature is @xmath15 .",

    "we use the same scale @xmath29 along both variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will return to the eventual difference between characteristic scales in different directions while the solution analysis to be provided . after introducing variables : @xmath30@xmath31 we obtain in boussinesq approximation ( in all terms besides of buoyancy one we put @xmath32 ) .@xmath33@xmath34 and fk equation is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath8 is a characteristic linear dimension and @xmath37 is characteristic velocity : @xmath38 then @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41is the grashof number , which after plugging ( @xmath42 takes the form:@xmath43 after cross differentiation of equations ( @xmath44 and ( @xmath45 ) we have : @xmath46 = \\ ] ] @xmath47   \\label{ns1 + 2}\\ ] ]    the fk equation rescales as @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50    next we would formulate the problem of free convection around the heated vertical isothermal  plate @xmath51 @xmath52 , dropping the primes . in this case",
    "we assume the angle between the plate and a stream line is small that means a possibility to neglect the horizontal component of velocity of fluid , denoting the vertical component as @xmath53 . in this paper",

    "so we choose for a calculation the variable that has the zero value for nondimentional temperature ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "the formulation should be based on physical assumptions for a concrete conditions .",
    "we would like to restrict ourselves by the fourth order approximation for both variables that means we neglect higher order terms starting from fifth one .",
