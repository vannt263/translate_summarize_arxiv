    "several recent theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite works have focused on a new quantum state of matter , _ topological insulators _ in three dimensions , which exhibit bulk insulating gaps ( mainly of spin - orbit origin ) while possess _ time - reversal symmetry _ protected gapless surface states .",
    "one of intriguing properties in this new quantum state comes from those `` protected '' surface states , which provide a lab - realizable condensed - matter analog of two dimensional , massless dirac theory with `` odd '' number of species ( dirac cones ) , in the surface brillouin zone ( sbz)@xcite . the charge carriers on the surfaces here , the so - called ( spin ) _ helical _ dirac fermions@xcite , behave like relativistic particles with a spin locked to its momentum leading to the breakdown of the spin @xmath0 rotational symmetry .",
    "this feature is sharply in contrast to graphene , where the system not only possesses an even number of dirac cones in its spectrum , but the role of the `` locked '' spin is also replaced by a pseudo - spin ( sublattice symmetry ) and hence each dirac cone still has two - fold spin degeneracy@xcite . as a useful surface probe ,",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments successfully demonstrated the surface band structures with odd number of dirac cones@xcite as well as the corresponding spin helical structures near a dirac point@xcite .",
    "although the confirmed nature of the bands by arpes suggests the quantum state to be topologically insulating , the quest for new quantum phenomena uniquely associated with such topology - protected surface states remains urgent and necessary .",
    "the usual way in solid state physics to explore the nontrivial electronic properties of helical dirac fermion systems would be the transport measurement on the surface of a topological insulator@xcite .",
    "however , such a measurement may not be practically straightforward , since ( i ) tuning the system to the topological transport regime where the charge density vanishes is tricky , and ( ii ) the presence of the n - type doping from vacancy ( or anti - site defects ) as well as the fact that the surface states surround the sample make the results difficult to be distinguished from the bulk and surface contributions@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) caused by scattering off impurities on a surface can provide a way of revealing the topological nature of the surface states@xcite .",
    "the concept of qpi is elementary in quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , due to impurity ( elastic ) scattering , the interference between the incoming and outgoing waves with momenta @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , can give rise to an amplitude modulation in the local density of states ( ldos ) at wavevector @xmath3 .",
    "such kind of interference pattern can be observed in fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ft - sts ) nowadays and it has been proved useful in determining the pairing nature of high-@xmath4 cuprates@xcite . by measuring the qpi patterns and analyzing them through a convolution of arpes data together with a spin - dependent scattering matrix element , roushan and et al@xcite were able to demonstrate the absence of backscattering in the topological surface states of @xmath5 , a key property of helical spin liquid .",
    "most recently , based on symmetry analysis , a new hexagonal warping term , which is absent in @xmath5 , is suggested by liang fu@xcite to explain the evolution of the fermi surface of the effective 2d helical dirac model describing the surface band structure of a family of 3d topological insulators , @xmath6 ( x = se or te ) . as measured in arpes experiments , the shape of the fermi surface ( fs ) evolves gradually from a hexagram , a hexagon , to a circle of shrinking volume , and finally meets at the dirac point when lowering the fermi energy .",
    "the new term leads to strong density variation around fermi surface and also modifies the spin helical configuration . as a result ,",
    "the existence of the new term can strongly modify the qpi .",
    "in other words , the qpi can provide a direct evidence to justify the model .    in this paper we systematically investigate the interference effects of a point - impurity and an edge - impurity scattering , respectively , on the ldos in a 2d helical dirac fermion system .",
    "we use @xmath7-matrix approach to calculate qpi spectra at a few representative energies , for emphasizing the effects of the hexagonal warping term , in the presence of a nonmagnetic / magnetic impurity .",
    "we also investigate an edge impurity by using a method generalized from 1d scattering problems with a potential barrier .",
    "several profound features are found in this study . in a nutshell",
    ", we observe : ( i ) the backward scattering by nonmagnetic point impurities is topologically suppressed , just as what has been shown in @xcite with a simpler empirical analysis , and the dominant interference pattern becomes that of spatial period @xmath8 when going away from the dirac regime ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cce_ew ] for the definition of @xmath9 ) ; ( ii ) in the presence of magnetic impurity , the qpi of charge density is very weak while that of spin density becomes strong .",
    "near the dirac regime , spin moments of fermions are flipped when scattering wave vector crosses over @xmath10 , as demonstrated in the ( @xmath11-component ) spin ldos [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmagz_qpi ] ( b ) ] ; ( iii ) the mirror symmetries of the spin ldos in the presence of in - plane magnetic impurity with spin polarization fixed along @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions can be used to determine the symmetry of microscopic models and to verify the presence or absence of the warping term ; ( iv ) in the case of 1d edge impurities , the friedel oscillation has no universal decaying function . depending on fermi surface energy ,",
    "we show that the oscillation decays as @xmath14 if the fs shape is dominated by the warping term , and as @xmath15 if the warping term is negligible . these special quantum phenomena , sharply in contrast to conventional metals ,",
    "are mainly associated with the 2d helical liquid .",
    "we now briefly introduce our used formalism below . the explicit model we study here",
    "is written as h()=v(k_x_y - k_y_x)++(k^3_+ + k^3_-)_z , [ eq : model ] where @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 denote fermi velocity and hexagonal warping parameter , respectively .",
    "the pauli matrices , @xmath19 , act on spin space of fermionic quasiparticles .",

    "the @xmath26-linear term , @xmath27 , describes an isotropic 2d helical dirac fermions , and the @xmath26-square term causes particle - hole asymmetry .",
    "more importantly , the @xmath26-cube warping term , @xmath28 , leads to hexagonal distortion of the fermi surface .",

    "[ fig : sfs ] .",
    "they clearly demonstrate the `` spin - helical '' nature of the 2d fermions , which is indeed essential when analyzing the qpi spectra later .",
    "in particular , as @xmath46 , non - vanishing spin moments along z direction ( out of surface plane ) are present mainly due to @xmath47 in the warping term , which is directly proportional to electron s spin .",

    "the model we have solved produces interference patterns that have enough features to be associated with the topology - protected surface states and the effects of the hexagonal warping term in 3d topological insulators .",
    "however , in order to be more careful before making conclusions , there are two more remarks we would like to mention here .",
    "\\(i ) in our calculations , we neglected the possibility of any ordering due to interaction - induced fs instability .",
    "this is valid as long as there is no significant fs nesting vector@xcite .",
    "in addition , we do not expect strong electron - electron interaction based on the following observation . in experiments on topological insulators ,",
    "the fermi level of the sample in general is closer to the bottom of the conduction band and is far away from the dirac point .",
    "such a system with finite density of states may provide enough screening effect to coulomb interaction between surface electrons .",
    "moreover , attempting to tune the fermi level lower by a metallic gate may also lead to the same phenomenon , turning interaction between electrons into irrelevant regime .",
    "( ii)in real systems , there is no purely magnetic impurity .",
    "a magnetic impurity should also have a non - magnetic component .",
    "this fact does not change our results obtained for magnetic impurities . in the parameter region",
    "we choose , the weak impurity approximation is always valid ( see a detailed discussion of this approximation in the appendix ) , the non - magnetic impurity only leads to the charge density modulation and has little effect on the sldos .",
    "namely , the magnetic part of impurity is solely responsible for the sldos .",
    "\\(iii ) as we noticed in section iii a , the stm experiment done by zhang et al.@xcite on [ 111 ] surface of bi@xmath22te@xmath23 exhibited six peaks in ft - ldos for the case of nonmagnetic impurities .",
    "the experimental result differs from our results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonmag_qpi](a ) by a 30 degrees of rotation . however , this discrepancy can be understood by noticing that in the energy range where they observed the clear interference patterns ( 50mev@xmath193400mev ) , the surface density of states are mixed with bulk states along @xmath25 . consequently , due to the superposition of waves with various wavelengths the interference patterns are simply smeared out in these regions . instead of a full fs we considered here ,",
    "the dominant interference patterns are then from other unmixed parts of the fs , , the parts along @xmath84 .",
    "\\(iv ) in an stm experiment done by alpichshev et al.@xcite , the decaying behavior of the friedel oscillation was claimed to be @xmath194 .",
    "however , in the case of 1d edge impurities , our calculation shows @xmath195 behavior if the fs shape is dominated by the warping term , and @xmath15 if the warping term is negligible .",
    "we believe there are two possible sources of the discrepancy .",
    "first , we notice that a simple fitting to the first several periods of oscillation is not enough to determine the decaying behavior . in fig.[fig",
    ": exp_exp ] , we show that the data in ref . can also be well fitted using an exponentially decaying function , as opposed to the @xmath194-type fit used in ref .. second , the experimental measurements are not a pure surface effect",
    ". there are bulk electrons in the nearby conduction band which can cause different decaying behavior and complicate the issue .",
    "more future experimental measurements are necessary to resolve the issue and test the theoretical predictions .",
    "\\(v ) we also notice that a similar theoretical work@xcite focusing solely on nonmagnetic impurity was posted online recently , which suggests the six peaks at fixed @xmath96 s that correspond to the scattering vectors connecting between second neighbor of the convex parts of the fs dominate in the qpi patterns .",
    "their results are consistent with our calculations since their results , according to the energy unit in our paper , are obtained at @xmath196 .",
    "however , our results suggest that the relative strength between the interference at @xmath96 s connecting next nearest neighboring vertices ( e.g. , @xmath9 and the interference at @xmath96 s connecting next nearest neighboring arc - centers ( e.g. , @xmath197 in the qpi patterns is quite subtle and depends on energy .",
    "therefore , a full @xmath7 matrix calculation is necessary in calculating the qpi patterns .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the quasiparticle scattering in a 2d helical liquid in the presence of nonmagnetic / magnetic point impurity or an nonmagnetic edge impurity .",
    "the inclusion of the hexagonal warping term in our system not only inherits the nature of the @xmath26-linear helical liquid but also sharpens our features mentioned above by distorting the shape of the fs .",
    "more importantly , it requires an out of plane spin texture and can be distinguished from other systems with examination of the mirror symmetries when the magnetic point impurity with in - plane spin moment is present .",
    "the absence ( presence ) of spots in ft - ldos ( ft - sldos ) , corresponding to the backscattering interference , are the essential features to confirm the topological nature of the helical liquid",
    ". the results in our work , as may be detected by stm experiments , can be a useful quantum signature , which is uniquely associated with this new phase of matter , a 3d topological insulator .",

    "next we show that the approximate symmetries listed in table[table1](a ) hold within the same approximation .",
    "according to the table , we have , for impurity spin ( again it is a purely magnetic impurity ) along the z - axis , the sldos @xmath205 , which is equivalent to @xmath206 .",

    "a simple consequence of the weak impurity approximation is a linear combination of ldos or sldos when there is more than one impurity , or an impurity that has both magnetic and non - magnetic parts . in the latter case",
    ", one can simply add up the ft - ldos and ft - sldos for each part to obtain the total configuration .",
