    "one of the most challenging and intriguing problems of cosmology is undoubtedly that of dark energy , the marginally dominant negative pressure component that drives the present acceleration of the universe ( for reviews see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the identification between dark energy and the energy of the vacuum ( cosmological constant ) , which , in some respect , may look as a `` minimal '' choice , rises at least a couple of embarrassing issues .",
    "the main concern is perhaps to explain why the vacuum energy is so small in particle physics units ( `` fine - tuning '' problem ) .",
    "moreover , beside being generically `` small '' , the cosmological constant happens to be exactly of the value required to become dominant at the present epoch .",
    "the latter mysterious circumstance is sometimes referred to as the `` coincidence problem '' .",
    "these puzzles may be better interpreted by assuming that the energy of the vacuum is , for some unknown cancellation mechanism , exactly zero and by considering in its place a dark energy component with a dynamically variable equation of state .",
    "a host of such models have been studied , ranging from quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , braneworlds @xcite , tachyons @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite etc .. effective scalar fields represent , in this respect , a simple and well motivated choice , since they are omnipresent in supersymmetric field theories and in string / m theory .",
    "for instance , a definite prediction of string theory is that the gauge and gravitational couplings are not fixed _ a priori _ but , rather , related to the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field , the dilaton .",
    "more precisely , at the tree level in the string loop expansion , the vacuum expectation value of the ( four dimensional ) dilaton @xmath2 is related to the gauge coupling @xmath3 and to the planck mass @xmath4 through @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the string mass and @xmath7 the universal regge slope parameter of the string .    the very existence of a relation between the couplings and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field ,",
    "although promisingly tasting of `` unification '' , threatens with possible violations of the equivalence principle as well as unobserved variations of the coupling constants .",
    "it is common wisdom @xcite to assume that the dilaton and the other moduli of the theory are given a mass by some non - perturbative mechanism , in such a way that their long range interactions are suppressed and their vevs frozen at some phenomenologically reasonable value .",
    "an alternative possibility is that , at the level of the effective action , the dilaton decouples from the other fields . to be more explicit ,",
    "let us consider a generic effective string action at lowest order in @xmath7 [ we use the convention @xmath8 for the metric ] @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the scalar curvature and @xmath11 is the gauge field . here",
    "the dilaton - dependent loop effects as well as the non - perturbative corrections are encoded in the `` coupling functions '' @xmath12 , and a tilde denotes the quantities as measured in the `` string frame '' , the sigma - model metric minimally coupled to the fundamental strings .    in the non  weak coupling region ( @xmath13 ) , where the loop effects are important , all the ( relevant ) functions @xmath12 may extremize at some value @xmath14 .",
    "this possibility has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where it has been shown that the cosmological evolution tends to push the dilaton toward the value @xmath14 .",
    "this is a phenomenologically `` safe '' vacuum where the massless dilaton decouples from the matter fields .    by means of a large - n argument ,",
    "veneziano has recently suggested @xcite that the effective couplings @xmath15 are , for the most part , _ induced _ by the quantum corrections of the many moduli and gauge bosons of the theory . as a result , these functions of @xmath2 reach an extremum at infinite _ bare _ coupling @xmath16 and follow the general behaviour @xmath17 in this scenario ( of the so called `` runaway dilaton '' ) , @xmath2 gradually decouples from gravity and from the matter fields by evolving towards infinity : @xmath18 .",
    "the moduli of the coefficients @xmath19 are proportional , by factors of order one , to the number @xmath20 of independent degrees of freedom which have been integrated over . what about their signs ?",
    "it is natural to require a sensible low energy theory e.g.  in our conventions  that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 be positive numbers .",
    "moreover , in order for the dilaton @xmath2 to behave as a `` normal '' scalar field in the limit of @xmath23 , the kinetic coefficient @xmath24 has to be negative .",
    "this choice was made in @xcite where the late - time cosmology and phenomenology of this model with a `` well - behaved '' scalar field were studied in some detail . in particular , in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a residual coupling of the dilaton to some hidden ( dark matter ? ) sector of the theory can give rise to a final cosmological attractor with both an accelerated expansion and a constant ratio between dark matter and dilatonic energy densities .",
    "such a type of `` scaling '' behaviour @xcite , relaxes the `` coincidence problem '' by interpreting the present energy budget of the universe ( dark matter @xmath25 , dark energy @xmath26 of the total ) as belonging to a stable attractor configuration .",
    "moreover , these scaling solutions can lead to a viable late - time cosmology @xcite with the acceleration starting earlier ( @xmath27 ) than in usual ( uncoupled ) dark energy models but still consistent with the recent type ia supernovae data @xcite .",
    "the opposite choice for the kinetic sign in ( [ intro ] ) , @xmath28 , leads to what in quantum field theory is called a `` ghost '' field or , in a more recent cosmological fashion , a `` phantom '' @xcite .",
    "when considered as dark energy candidates , ghosts can have an equation of state parameter @xmath29 which is not ruled out ( rather , slightly favoured @xcite ) by current observations .",
    "ghosts / phantoms prove to have a viable cosmological behavior which has been extensively studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and also constrained with observations @xcite .",
    "although intriguing as `` classical  cosmological '' fields , phantoms are generally plagued by severe uv quantum instabilities and an unnatural lorenz invariance breaking  cut off of @xmath30 mev is required to prevent an overproduction of cosmic gamma rays @xcite . ] , so that the fundamental origin of a @xmath31 component still represents an interesting challenge for theoreticians .",
    "recently , it has been shown that a scalar field with a wrong sign kinetic term does not necessarily lead to inconsistencies , provided a suitable structure of higher order kinetic terms exists in the effective theory @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism resembles that of a @xmath32theory , where the field acquires a non - zero vev and the energy of the small fluctuations around the new minimum is bounded from below . by the same token , in a theory with higher order kinetic terms",
    ", the field can `` condensate '' at a non - constant background value , @xmath33 , which is perfectly stable at the quantum level .",
    "the basic scheme is that of a lagrangian of the type @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a canonically normalized ( ghost ) scalar field and @xmath36 a mass scale . in this case",
    "a background value @xmath37 can , at the same time , be quantum mechanically stable ( @xmath38 ) and act as a negative pressure component ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "a kinetically driven cosmic acceleration has been proposed both in inflationary @xcite and quintessence @xcite contexts .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent works about ghost condensation .",
    "in this paper we highlight the runaway dilaton scenario by exploiting the possibility that string ",
    "loop corrections may result in the `` wrong '' kinetic sign for the dilaton at the effective level [ i.e. @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ bidef ] ) ] .",
    "the low energy theory can still be consistent if the dilaton , by a mechanism similar to that in @xcite , `` condensates '' in a `` safe '' vacuum configuration .",
    "we also show that a residual coupling of the scalar field to dark matter can lead to a late - time accelerating universe with the fractional densities of dark matter and dark energy that remain constant in time . in section 2 we sketch the origin of our model from the low - energy limit of string theory . in section 3",
    "we address the stability of quantum fluctuations for a scalar field @xmath35 whose lagrangian is a general function of @xmath40 and of @xmath35 itself .",
    "we also generalize the late - time attractors studied in @xcite and derive the general functional form of the lagrangians that allow this type of scaling solutions . in section 4",
    "we study the dynamics of the effective ghost / dilaton for various choices of the parameters .",
    "it is found that in the absence of the coupling @xmath41 between the dilaton and the non - relativistic matter one can get a viable attractor solution which asymptotically approaches a de sitter phase without violating the stability of the vacuum .",
    "we also show that there exist well - behaved cosmological scaling solutions if the coupling @xmath41 grows from nearly zero to a constant value during the transition to the dilaton - dominant era .",
    "we give conclusions and discussions in the final section .",
    "let us consider a general four - dimensional effective low - energy string action @xcite @xmath42 \\ , + \\ , \\wt{{\\cal   s}}_m[\\phi ,   \\wt{g}_{\\mu\\nu } , \\psi_i]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the scalar curvature and @xmath2 is the ( four dimensional ) dilaton field with potential @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 is the action for the matter fields @xmath45 , which we suppose that they are generally coupled to the dilaton .",
    "the dilaton - dependent loop effects as well as the non - perturbative corrections are encoded , at the lowest order of approximation in the universal regge slope parameter @xmath46 , in the `` coupling functions '' @xmath12 . in the weak coupling region of the theory , where the tree - level ( four dimensional ) string coupling @xmath47 is much smaller than one ,",
    "the functions @xmath12 can be expressed by an expansion of the form @xmath48 as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will assume that in the region with @xmath23 , the coupling functions @xmath15 have the following behavior @xmath49 asymptotically approaching a constant value as @xmath50",
    ". therefore the dilaton gradually decouples from gravity as the field evolves toward the region with @xmath23 from the weakly coupled regime . in this scenario , the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath51 are of order @xmath52 ( the number of independent degrees of freedom which have been integrated over ) and unity respectively .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the conformally related `` einstein '' metric @xcite @xmath53 in the above relation the constant factor @xmath54 has been chosen so that the einstein metric approximates the `` string '' one in the limit @xmath55 .",
    "note that in the runaway dilaton scenario the 4-dimensional planck mass @xmath4 is asymptotically related to the string scale @xmath56 through @xmath57 , which makes sense if one considers that the coefficients @xmath19 are expected to be of order @xmath52 .",

    "when the expression in square brackets is positive the dilaton behaves as a normal scalar field ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "for example it is known that at tree level , despite the positive sign of the kinetic term in the string - frame ( @xmath64 ) , we have , in the einstein - frame , a `` proper '' scalar field .    in the runaway scenario that we are considering ( [ triv ] )",
    "the value of @xmath61 crucially depends on the sign of @xmath24 , since in the @xmath23 limit the expression in square brackets in ( [ fvdef ] ) evaluates @xmath65 .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine that loop corrections give the `` wrong '' kinetic sign to the dilaton , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "this possibility , in principle , does nt worry us too much since , as sketched in the introduction and analyzed in some detail in section 3 , higher order kinetic terms may ensure the stability of quantum fluctuations by `` condensating '' @xcite the ghost field in a stable vacuum .",
    "however , if we are to interpret a ghost condensate as dark energy , a `` fine - tuning '' problem , identical to that of the cosmological constant , arises .",
    "the higher order kinetic terms are in fact generically suppressed by powers of the cut - off ( string- ) scale and therefore are expected to be largely subdominant today . a possible way out ,",
    "again , is to consider the effects of the loop corrections . in particular",
    ", the contributions of the lightest fields ( neutrinos ? ) should dominate the higher order corrections giving effective terms of the type @xmath67 , @xmath36 being the mass of the lightest ( coupled ) field running into the loops .    in what follows",
    "we will concentrate on an ( admittedly , ad - hoc ) higher order correction to insert in ( [ eaction ] ) of the type ( see also @xcite ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are numbers of order one and @xmath36 a mass scale .",
    "exponential corrections of this type are naively expected if the theory contains `` exponentially light '' ( @xmath71 ; i.e. @xmath72 ) fields running into the loops .    while considering as our basic structure the one with @xmath73 , for the sake of generality we also cite the possibility of a `` zeroth order '' kinetic contribution : a potential term @xmath74 for the dilaton .",
    "since there is no trace of it at tree level , @xmath75 must be of non - perturbative origin ( e.g. , @xmath76 ) and dying out exponentially at weak coupling ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we will make also the `` phenomenological '' request that it goes to zero in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "a viable ansatz is @xcite @xmath79\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is some mass scale , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants satisfying @xmath83 .",
    "this is a bell - type potential which has a maximum in an intermediate regime .",
    "note that in the strongly coupled region ( @xmath23 ) the potential behaves as @xmath84 in summary , the most general scalar field lagrangian that we consider is @xmath85 where , by equation ( [ fvdef ] ) , @xmath86 . before going into the details of our model ,",
    "let us have a look at some general properties of a scalar field @xmath87 whose lagrangian density is a generic function of @xmath88 and of @xmath87 itself .",
    "in this section we analyze some general features of a canonical cosmological scalar field @xmath87 whose lagrangian is a general function of the scalar quadratic kinetic term @xmath89 and of the field itself @xcite .",
    "we consider the following action written in the `` einstein frame '' @xmath90   + { \\cal s}_m [ \\varphi , \\psi_i , g_{\\mu \\nu}]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the action for the matter fields , which is generally dependent on @xmath35 as well .",
    "hereafter we will use the unit @xmath94 , but we restore the planck mass when it is needed .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) can be expressed as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field that we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ lag2 ] ) reads @xmath98 here and in the following a suffix @xmath91 or @xmath35 indicates a partial derivative with respect to @xmath91 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "we note that the energy momentum tensor ( [ emtensor ] ) of the scalar field is that of a perfect fluid , @xmath99 , with velocity @xmath100 and energy density @xmath101      in order to address the problem of the quantum stability of the scalar field in action ( [ lag2 ] ) we consider the dynamics of the small fluctuations @xmath102 around a background value @xmath37 which is a solution of the equations of motions .",
    "since @xmath103 depends both on @xmath35 and its derivatives , the most general case to be considered is that of a background with both @xmath104 and @xmath33 . in particular , the choice of a background field evolving in time is essential for the mechanism of `` ghost condensation '' @xcite , by which a scalar theory with the `` wrong '' kinetic sign settles to a stable vacuum .",
    "we divide the field @xmath35 into a homogeneous part @xmath37 and a fluctuation @xmath105 , as @xmath106 since we are most concerned with uv instabilities it is not restrictive to consider a minkowski background metric and to choose , at least locally , a time direction in such a way to satisfy ( [ decompose ] ) . by expanding @xmath107 at the second order in @xmath105 it is straightforward to find the lagrangian and then the hamiltonian for the fluctuations .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath108 the fluctuations of a time - varying scalar typically obey lorentz - violating dispersion relations @xcite .",
    "this should not worry us too much since , in a cosmological setup , lorenz invariance is always violated by the presence of a `` preferred '' ( cmb , comoving observers ) frame .",
    "the positive definiteness has a meaning if compared with the sign of the hamiltonian of the other fields , which we take to be positive .",
    "] of the hamiltonian is guaranteed if the following conditions hold @xmath109 both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are usually taken into account when considering the stability of classical perturbations .",
    "the quantity often used is the speed of sound @xmath112 defined by @xcite @xmath113 which in cosmological perturbations appears as a coefficient of the @xmath114 term ( here @xmath115 is the scale factor and @xmath116 is the comoving momentum ) .",
    "while the classical fluctuations may be regarded to be stable when @xmath117 is positive , it is essential , for the quantum stability , that both @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "these two conditions , in fact , prevent an instability of a very bad type related to the presence of negative energy `` ghost '' states which render the vacuum unstable under a catastrophic production of ghosts and photons pairs @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a uv instability , since the rate of production from the vacuum is simply proportional to the phase space integral on all possible final states and since only a uv cut off can prevent the creation of modes of arbitrarily high energies . when the lagrangian @xmath120 is written as @xmath121 , as was considered in most of the phantom dark energy models @xcite , the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 are both negative .",
    "the situation is different if we take into account higher - order terms such as @xmath122 in @xmath120 .",
    "for example , consider the case with @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "then one has @xmath124 and @xmath125 . when @xmath118 and @xmath119 , corresponding to @xmath126 , the system is completely stable at the quantum level . in the region of @xmath127 one",
    "has @xmath128 and @xmath129 so that the perturbations are classically stable due to the positive sign of @xmath117 .",
    "this vacua is , however , generally quantum mechanically unstable .",
    "the kind of instability prevented by the condition ( [ xi2 ] ) , is of the tachyonic type and generally much less dramatic , provided that the conditions ( [ xi ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the point is that if @xmath130 there are modes , the ones with @xmath131 , that undergo a classical exponential growth .",
    "this is an intrinsically ir instability of the kind often encountered in cosmology when perturbations of super - horizon scales are considered .",
    "in fact , for a `` normal '' cosmological scalar field @xmath132 , one has just @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the hubble rate . for the above reasons we will adopt ( [ xi ] ) but not ( [ xi2 ] ) as fundamental criteria for the consistency of the theory and we will eventually make sure that the effects of @xmath135 are negligible on the relevant physical scales .",
    "we now set the field @xmath35 in a cosmological framework and study its evolution in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background spacetime with scale factor @xmath136 @xmath137 the equation for @xmath35 can be written as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the hubble rate and the scalar charge @xmath140 corresponds to the coupling between the matter and the dilaton and it is defined by the relation @xmath141 .",

    "[ varyingq ] , we require a step - like change of the coupling @xmath41 during the transition to the scalar - field dominant era .    in our work we carried out the analysis for the simplified lagrangian ( [ ourlag ] ) in order to understand the basic picture of the system with a phantom - type scalar field .",
    "in string theory we have other non - perturbative and loop corrections such as the gauss - bonnet curvature invariant @xcite .",
    "it is certainly of interest to extend our analysis to such a direction .",
    "we are grateful to parampreet singh for his contribution at the early stages of this work and for very useful discussions and comments on the draft .",

    "in this appendix we consider the classical evolution of the system in the absence of the higher - order terms in @xmath91 with the exponential potential of the dilaton ( @xmath236 , @xmath233 and @xmath199 ) .",
    "although the stability of quantum fluctuations is not ensured for @xmath236 , it is worth clarifying the classical evolution to compare it with the case in which higher - order terms are included . when @xmath199 we obtain the following fixed points by setting @xmath257 and @xmath345 in eqs .",
    "( [ xeq ] ) and ( [ zeq ] ) : @xmath346 the first solution is a trivial one which approaches @xmath347 at late times . on the other hand the second one corresponds to an asymptotic solution with @xmath279 at late times .",
    "this differs from the scaling solutions that approach a nonzero value of @xmath142 or @xmath229 .",
    "the scaling solutions which keep @xmath142 constant in the range @xmath334 do not exist in the present case , since @xmath142 becomes negative in eq .",

    "when @xmath236 the equation of state for the field @xmath35 is given as @xmath348 from eq .",
    "( [ quan ] ) the function @xmath349 is generally expressed as @xmath350 therefore the second fixed point in eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) corresponds to the equation of state @xmath351 which is less than @xmath259 .",
    "it is clear that this is different from the scaling solution ( [ likebefore ] ) with @xmath199 , since @xmath352 in this case .",
    "this constant behavior of @xmath152 for the exponential potential was numerically found in ref .",
    "@xcite , but we succeeded to derive it analytically .",
    "the field @xmath35 is driven up the potential hill due to the negative kinematic term .    we can consider the bell - type potential ( [ po ] ) in order to follow the classical evolution of the dilaton",
    ". then the dilaton evolves toward the potential _ maximum _ and is eventually stabilized there . in the region",
    "where the potential ( [ po ] ) is effectively described by an exponential one , we have numerically checked the existence of the constant equation of state characterized by eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) . for the bell - type potential , this stage is only transient and @xmath152 approaches @xmath259 as the field evolves toward the potential maximum .",
    "after the field is stabilized there , we have @xmath353 and @xmath354 , thus yielding @xmath269 .",
    "this classical evolution of the dilaton is similar to what was already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , hence we do not repeat it here . if one takes into account the coupling between the dilaton and the matter ( @xmath355 , we have additional scaling solutions characterized by eq .",
