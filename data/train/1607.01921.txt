    "atom - scale identification of structures of solid surfaces in real space has been achieved by the scanning probe microscopy in which either the tunneling electric current between the surface and the probing tip [ scanning tunneling microscope ( stm)@xcite ] or the forces acting on atoms on the tip [ atomic force microscope ( afm)@xcite ] is measured at a certain lateral position with atomic resolution .",
    "this scanning probe technique has been also utilized to manipulate atoms on surfaces .",
    "eigler and schweizer first manipulated xe atoms on ni surfaces at 4 k,@xcite and then crommie _ et al . _ made a quantum corral by placing fe atoms on the ni surface using an stm probe.@xcite the afm probe has been also successfully utilized for the atomic manipulation on the si surface,@xcite expanding the feasibility to non - conductive surfaces .",
    "moreover , the manipulation of an atom on semiconductor surfaces at room temperature leads to the possibility of bottom - up fabrication processes in nanotechnology .",
    "since then , many types of atomic manipulation by the afm probe has been achieved .",
    "they include vertical interchange of the tip and surface atoms on the sn - covered si(111 ) surface,@xcite lateral interchange of adatoms on the ge(111)@xcite and on the si(111)@xcite surfaces , lateral manipulation of single si and ge adatoms on the si(111)@xcite and the ge(111)@xcite surfaces , respectively , and the controlled diffusion of ag adatom on the si(111 ) surface.@xcite albeit these stimulating experimental achievements , clarification of the underlying microscopic mechanisms of these atomic manipulation processes remains to be clarified .",
    "the atomic manipulation is classified into two categories : lateral manipulation in which a surface atom is moved and placed at a certain site with the aid of the probe , and the vertical manipulation in which a surface atom is interchanged with a probe atom and then moved to a different position .",
    "as for the former , sugimoto _ et al .",
    "_ first successfully achieved the lateral interchange of surface sn and ge adatoms on the ge(111)-c(2@xmath08 ) surface@xcite and then succeeded in lateral interchange of sb and si adatoms on the si(111)-(7 @xmath0 7 ) surface.@xcite it is noteworthy that such lateral interchange is observed without the probing tip : ganz _ et al .",
    "_ showed that pb and ge adatoms are interchanged with each other on the ge(111)-c(2@xmath08 ) surface at temperatures from 24 to 79@xmath1c without the probing tip.@xcite this implies that the lateral interchange manipulation with the probing tip is essentially the enhancement of the combined process of the migration or diffusion and the subsequent exchange of adatoms .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to examine the possibility of these enhanced atomic reactions with the probing tip based on the first - principles calculations .",
    "atomistic calculations have provided insights into the interaction between the afm tip and the surface atoms.@xcite perz _",
    "et al._@xcite performed the total energy calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite for si tips on the si(111 ) surface and have found that the covalent interaction between the tip and the surface atoms is important for the atom - scale resolution in afm .",
    "it is also found that weak ionic interaction due to the charge transfer plays a role on the cu(001 ) surface.@xcite the structure of the si tip and its effect on the tip - surface interaction have been examined by the dft calculation.@xcite as for the atom manipulation , dieka and tich are first to provide a theoretical insight on the lateral interchange of sn and ge atoms on the sn - covered ge(111)-c(2@xmath08 ) surface.@xcite they have found that with the presence of an afm tip , the energy barrier of the adatom migration is 0.6 - 0.8 ev but that the subsequent exchange is associated with the energy barrier of more than 1 ev , concluding that the lateral interchange is unlikely to occur .",
    "then they proposed , based on the dft calculation using specific tip structure model , that the interchange could occur via the exchange of the tip and the surface atoms .",
    "however in the corresponding experiment,@xcite the discontinuity in the frequency shift which is usually expected in the atom transferring between the tip and the surface was not observed .    in this paper",
    ", we perform extensive density - functional calculations for the sn - covered and pb - covered ge(111 ) surfaces and also sb - covered si(111 ) surface to resolve the microscopic mechanism for the lateral interchange of surface atoms .",
    "we first examine the diffusion ( migration ) and exchange processes without the afm tip .",
    "we identify the diffusion pathways : there are several metastable atomic configurations and the diffusion takes place via step - by - step migration among the configurations .",
    "we find , when the target two atoms are close to each other , that the two atoms spontaneously form a dimer structure which provides a new reaction pathway for the exchange process .",
    "the energy barrier for the exchange process is substantially lower than that examined in the past.@xcite we also find that the presence of the afm tip lowers the migration barrier and further assists in the formation of the precursor dimer structure , leading to the more frequent lateral interchange .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "structural optimization is performed using calculated hellmann - feynman forces .",
    "all the atoms except for the bottommost layer atoms and the attached h atoms are relaxed until the forces acting on the atoms are smaller than 0.1 ev/. the conditions explained above assure that the numerical error of the total energy is less than 0.04 ev .    to identify the reaction pathways of the interchange of surface atoms and the corresponding energy barriers , we adopt nudged elastic band ( neb ) method.@xcite this method partly assures continuity of the reaction pathway , compared with the hyperplane constraint method,@xcite by introducing fictitious elastic forces during the energy minimization .",

    "it is noteworthy that the tip apex atom has a dangling bond which points toward the surface direction .",
    "in this section , we first present our results for the lateral interchange process without the afm tip .",
    "we identify the detailed migration mechanism and find a pathway for the exchange process via a dimer structure newly found in our calculation .",

    "[ fig : surfaces](b ) ] .",
    "we examine the interchange process in which one of the two target atoms migrates near to the other atom for the exchange to take place , and then the other atom migrates to the vacant adatom site .",
    "there are two scenarios : in the first scenario , the foreign adatom at the site 0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfaces ] migrates near to the host adatom located at the site 4 ; then when the two atoms are close enough to each other , an exchange process starts .",
    "after the exchange process , the adatom originally at site 4 migrates to the vacant site 0 ( @xmath3 process hereafter ) . in the second scenario ,",
    "the roles of the two atoms are changed : i.e. , the host adatom at the site 4 migrates near the site 0 and the two atoms are exchanged , and then the foreign adatom originally at site 0 migrates to the vacant site 4 ( @xmath4 process hereafter ) .",
    "it may be possible that both the two atoms migrate , meet together , are exchanged and then migrate back . or the two atoms both migrate independently and reach the site where the partner atom is originally located .",
    "however , in these processes , the two sites at which the adatom disappears are generated .",
    "this costs the energy roughly twice compared with the situation in which one of the two atoms stay at the stable site .",
    "hence we consider the two scenarios described above in this paper .          in this subsection , we present the results of the migration pathway and the corresponding energy barrier in the interchange reaction on the ge(111 ) surface without the tip .",
    "we find that the hollow sites labeled as h@xmath5 and the on - top sites above the third - layer host atom labeled as t@xmath6 ( fig .  [ fig : surfaces ] ) are ( meta)stable for the adatom , in accordance with the previous work of takeuchi _",
    "et al._.@xcite at these sites , the adatom forms three bonds with the second layer ge atoms which makes these sites ( meta)stable .",
    "there are three steps in the adatom migration before the two adatoms get close to each other in @xmath3 and @xmath4 processes : in the @xmath3 process , the foreign adatom migrates from site 0 to site 1 , then from site 1 to site 2 , and thirdly from site 2 to site 3 .",
    "interestingly we have found that the foreign adatom spontaneously forms a dimer with the host adatom at site 3 ( see below and fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_strs ] ) .",
    "we call this dimer structure @xmath7 hereafter .",
    "the energy profiles for the migration of sn and pb adatoms along the pathway we have determined are shown in the left part of the fig .",

    "[ fig : i1i2 ] ) . in migration 1 , the rate - determining processes are _ 04 _ @xmath11 _ 14 _ and _ 14 _ @xmath11 _ 24 _ migrations for sn and pb adatoms , respectively , as are deduced from our migration - energy calculations ( table [ tb : barriers ] ) .",
    "the calculated rate - determining migration energy is 0.60 ev for sn and 0.49 ev for pb .",
    "this indicates that pb migrates more frequently than sn .    in the @xmath4 process",
    ", we have found that the host ge adatom migrates toward the foreign adatom at site 0 via the three metastable configurations , _ 04 _ , _ 03 _ and _ 02 _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i1i2 ] ( b ) ( migration 1 ) .",
    "again we have found that , after the _ 02 _ configuration , the ge adatom forms the dimer structure spontaneously . in the migration 1 process , the rate - determining process is the first movement from _ 04 _ to _ 03 _ ( table [ tb : barriers ] ) .",
    "the calculated barriers are 0.80 ev for the sn - covered surface and 0.79 ev for the pb - covered surface",
    ". these migration barriers are definitely larger than those of the rate - determining barriers in the @xmath3 process , indicating that the foreign adatom is likely to move toward the host ge adatom and then make the exchange .",
    "after the two adatoms become close to each other , the exchange reaction via the dimer structures occurs ( details are given in the next subsection ) . by the exchange ,",
    "two adatoms change their places : e.g. , @xmath7 and @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_strs ] . after this exchange ,",
    "one of the two adatoms migrates to the vacant site : ge goes to the site 0 in the @xmath3 process and the foreign adatom goes to the site 4 in the @xmath4 process .",

    "we have found that the migration barriers in the migration 2 process for sn , pb and ge adatoms are relatively lower than those of the migration 1 process ( table .",

    "this is what is expected since the migration 2 is the atomic transitions from the higher to the lower energy configurations whereas the migration 1 is the contrary .    [",

    "we have also found other dimer structures , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath12 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 shown in fig .",

    "a possibility is a structural transition as @xmath19 ( path 1 ) .",
    "an alternative way ( path 2 ) is the transition as @xmath20 .",
    "we note that only a single adatom changes its position during this structural transition ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dimer_strs ] ) so that the energy cost may be reduced .",
    "it can be seen that the positions of the two adatoms are exchanged during the @xmath21 and @xmath22 structures . for both sn and pb ,",

    "we have found that the energy barriers for the dimer - dimer transitions and thus the exchange reaction is substantially smaller than 1 ev for both paths 1 and 2 : the rate determining process is @xmath23 with the barrier of 0.64 ev for the path 1 and @xmath24 with the barrier of 0.60 ev for the path 2 . in both rate - determining dimer - dimer transitions , the ge adatom rather than the foreign adatom hops to the nearby site . this is a consequence from the difference in the strength among the sn - ge , the pb - ge and the ge - ge bonds .",
    "these energy barriers are substantially lower than that for the direct exchange discussed in the past.@xcite the dimer formation we have found is the key process for the reduced energy barrier .    in the @xmath4 process , the ge adatom comes near to the site 1 and then spontaneously forms a dimer with the foreign adatom ( @xmath25 structure hereafter ) .",
    "we have also found other five ( meta)stable dimer structures ( from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : not shown here ) as in the @xmath3 process .",
    "then the exchange reaction takes place through two paths : i.e. , the @xmath28 process ( path 1 ) and the @xmath29 process ( path 2 ) . sn or pb adatom hops in @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and ge adatom hops in the rest of the dimer - dimer structural transitions .",

    "again the highest barriers of about 0.7 ev appear in the structural transitions in which the ge adatom rather than the foreign adatom hops to the nearby site .",
    "the shape of the energy profile in the @xmath4 process is almost the mirror image of that of the @xmath3 process .      in this subsection",

    "the rule of the labeling of the metastable configurations are the same as that in the previous subsections .",
    "the calculated migration barriers are 0.76 ev for the _ 04 _ @xmath11 _ 14 _ process and 0.60 ev for the _ 14 _ @xmath11 _ 24 _ process",
    ". after the migration , unlike the adatoms on the ge(111 ) surface , sb and si adatoms do not form dimer structure : the @xmath21 structure shown in the energy profile is a structure similar to the @xmath7 structure of ge and sn adatoms on the ge surface .",
    "however , it is not metastable structure and goes back to the structure _ 24 _ upon the structural optimization .",
    "similarly , in @xmath4 process , we have calculated the energy profile of si adatom migration toward sb adatom ( the _ 04 _ @xmath11 _ 03 _ @xmath11 _ 02 _ @xmath11 @xmath35 migration ) .",
    "the energy barriers for the _ 04 _ @xmath11 _ 03 _ step and the _ 03 _ @xmath11 _ 02 _ step are 0.92 ev and 0.57 ev , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbsi ] ( b ) .",
    "we have found that a dimer structure ( @xmath25 structure ) is metastable .",
    "however , it is not stable enough at room temperature for the energy barrier in the @xmath36 reaction is less than 10 mev .",
    "the relatively high migration barriers of sb and si adatoms show that the migration of sb and si adatoms on the si(111 ) surface is less frequent than that of pb , sn and ge adatoms on ge(111 ) surface .",
    "in addition to that , the dimer structure which assists in the exchange on the ge(111 ) surface is practically unstable on the si ( 111 ) surface , indicating that the adatom interchange is unlikely to occur on the si(111 ) surface without the afm tip .",
    "we are now in a position to examine the effect of the afm tip on the interchange reaction between the foreign and host adatoms .",
    "we here present our result regarding the @xmath3 process on ge(111 ) and si(111 ) surfaces with the presence of the afm tip .",
    "the time scale of the tip motion in the afm measurements is in the order of microseconds , whereas that of the atomic motion on the surface is picoseconds .",
    "hence we simulate the effect of the afm tip in a static manner .",
    "the tip is placed at 5 and 4.75 distances from the surface for the ge and si surfaces , respectively . at these distances ,",
    "the short - range attractive force between the tip and the surface is found to arise , which corresponds to the experimental situation .",

    "is scanned over the line connecting two adatoms with the time scale of milliseconds at fastest .",
    "to simulate this situation , tip apex atom is placed at the middle of the site 2 and the site 4 and then the interchange reaction is investigated .",
    "we have identified the migration and the exchange reaction pathways in the @xmath3 process on the sn - covered ge(111 ) surface .",
    "we have found that the reaction pathway is essentially identical to that with the absence of the afm tip . however , the afm tip substantially modulates the energy profile along the reaction coordinate . the calculated energy profile of the reaction with the presence of the afm tip is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tip_profile ] ( a ) . the migration barrier from the structure _ 04 _ to the structure _ 14 _ is unchanged by the presence of the afm tip ( cf .",
    "[ fig : i1i2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "however , the barrier of the _ 14 _ @xmath11 _ 24 _ migration is lowered from 0.47 ev to 0.35 ev by the afm tip .",
    "the lateral distances between tip apex atom and sn atom in the saddle point configuration is about 3.0 .",
    "it shows that the interaction between the tip apex atom and the migrating adatom starts from relatively large distance .",
    "not only the migration barrier is lowered , but also the total energy difference between the most stable _ 04 _ and the metastable _ 24 _ configurations is decreased from 0.56 ev to 0.37 ev .",
    "this means that the _ 24 _ configuration is stabilized by the afm tip .",
    "the exchange process is also enhanced by the afm tip . as stated above",
    ", the rate - determining exchange process without the tip is the @xmath23 with the barrier of 0.64 ev for the path 1 and the @xmath24 with the barrier of 0.60 ev . with the presence of the afm tip",
    ", we have found that the transition state between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 in path 1 for instance disappears with the presence of the afm tip .",
    "instead , an energy dip labeled by _ m _ emerges [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tip_profile](a ) ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the formation of the covalent bond between the tip apex atom and the hopping ge atom ( see below ) . as a result ,",
    "the rate - determining process becomes the @xmath37 dimer - dimer transition with the barrier of 0.40 ev [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tip_profile ] ( a ) ] .    in the path 2 , the tip apex atom forms a bond with the sn adatom and pins it at the position in the @xmath7 structure .",
    "consequently , the hopping of ge adatom is suppressed in @xmath24 transition with the barrier of 0.89 ev due to the restricted relaxation of the sn adatom .",
    "this implies that the enhancement and the suppression of the reactions generally depend on the atom - scale positioning of the afm tip .",
    "the energy profile for the interchange reaction obtained by our gga calculations unequivocally clarifies that the afm tip reduces the energy barrier in both migration and the exchange processes .    in order to clarify the microscopic reason for the reduction of the reaction barriers , we have examined the charge density at the _ m _ configuration during the @xmath23 structural transition .",

    "[ fig : charge](b ) .",
    "this bond formation makes the _ m _ configuration energetically favorable and thus assists in the hopping of the ge adatom during the @xmath23 structural transition .",

    "in contrast to that , we have found that the dimer structure which is a precursors for the exchange reaction is formed with the presence of the afm tip on the si(111 ) surface .",
    "further we have found the four dimer structures , @xmath7 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath12 as on the ge surface , on the sb covered si(111)-(7@xmath07 ) surface .",

    "the energy for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 migrations are 0.77 ev and 0.55 ev , respectively .",

    "the energy barriers among the dimer - dimer structural transitions are in the range of 0.2 ev - 0.5 ev . in the whole interchange reaction , the rate - determining processes are the migration _ 04 _ @xmath11 _ 14 _ and the dimer dissociation @xmath22 @xmath11 _ 42 _ with the energy barriers of 0.68 ev and 0.63 ev , respectively .",
    "the total energy difference of the structures _",

    "we have first clarified the atom - scale reaction pathways for the adatom interchange without the afm tip . we have found that the interchange reaction on the ge(111 ) surface occurs as follows : ( i ) an adatom migrates toward the other adatom ( forward migration ) , ( ii ) it spontaneously forms a dimer with the other adatom , ( iii ) there are several total - energy equal dimer structures , and the exchange of the two adatoms is realized through the dimer - dimer structural transitions , and finally ( iv ) the exchanged adatom migrates to the vacant site generated by the forward migration ( backward migration ) .",
    "the calculated energy barriers are substantially lower than the barriers discussed in the past .",
    "this is due to the multistability of the dimer structures newly found in the present calculation . on the si(111 ) surface ,",

    "we have also identified the reaction pathways and the corresponding energy barriers for the interchange reaction with the presence of the afm tip . for the ge(111 ) surface , we have found that the reaction takes place similarly , i.e. , the forward migration , the dimer - assisted exchange and the backward migration .",
    "further , due to the bond formation of the tip apex atom and the surface adatom , the reaction barriers for the migration and the exchange processes are substantially reduced .",
    "we have also found that the afm tip induces qualitative difference in the interchange phenomena on the si(111 ) surface .",
    "the reaction channel for the exchange through the dimer formation opens with the tip - surface interaction : we have found that the formation of the covalent bond between the tip apex atom and the surface adatom causes the formation of the multistable dimer structures and thereby make the interchange reaction feasible .",
    "our calculations show that the bond formation between the afm tip atom and the surface adatom is the essential physics for the atom manipulation .",
    "this also implies that the precise placement of the afm tip is important in more sophisticated atomic manipulation .",
    "this work was supported by the `` computational materials science initiative '' and also by the project for priority issue ( creation of new functional devices and high - performance materials to support next - generation industries ) to be tackled by using post ` k ' computer , both conducted by ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan .",
    "computations were performed mainly at the supercomputer center at the institute for solid state physics , the university of tokyo , the research center for computational science , national institutes of natural sciences , and the center for computational science , university of tsukuba .",
