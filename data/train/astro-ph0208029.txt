    "we have obtained deep ubvri ccd photometry for trumpler  14 , trumpler  16 and collinder  232 , the three young open clusters closest to @xmath0 carina  . in this paper",
    "we briefly summarize our analysis methods and results .",
    "first of all we have tried to reconstruct the extinction pattern in the direction of the three clusters . by combining optical photometry with near infrared photometry and spectral classification for a sample of stars in the three clusters ,",
    "we find by using a variety of methods that the total to selective absorption ratio varies from cluster to cluster , being @xmath1 , and @xmath2 for trumpler  16 , trumpler  14 and collinder  232 , respectively .",
    "then , by using the method devised by romaniello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we derived individual star color excesses and built up reddening corrected colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , from which we constrain clusters s distances , finding that trumpler  14 , trumpler  16 and collinder  232 are located @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 kpc from the sun , respectively .",
    "the method devised by romaniello et al .",
    "( 2001 ) provides also stars luminosities and effective temperatures , that we used to construct the hr diagram ( hrd ) for the clusters , which , together with cmds , have been used to derive clusters ages and age spreads . to this aim",
    "pre - main sequence ( ms ) isochrones have been adopted from ventura et al .",
    "we find that trumpler  16 is older than trumpler  14 , and that all the clusters have a prominent pre - ms population . as an example , in fig .  1 we present our results for collinder  232 , that we conclude to be a real open cluster ."
