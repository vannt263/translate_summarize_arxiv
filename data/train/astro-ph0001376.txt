    "the evolution of the space density of clusters of galaxies is a measurement sensitive to the physical and cosmological parameters of models of structure formation .",
    "we describe a deep x - ray survey of clusters of galaxies ( the wide angle rosat pointed survey or warps ) , and use it to measure the evolution of the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of clusters of galaxies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fairley et al ( these proceedings ) describe our results on the evolution of the cluster x - ray luminosity - temperature relation at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "our goal was to compile a complete , unbiased , x - ray selected sample of clusters of galaxies from serendipitous detections in deep , high - latitude rosat pspc pointings . a detailed review of the x - ray source detection algorithm used ( voronoi tessellation and percolation or vtp ) , the sample selection and flux correction techniques are given in @xcite .",
    "vtp is particularly well suited to the detection and characterization of low surface brightness emission and to the recognition of extended sources .",
    "only the centre of the rosat pspc field was used , up to an off - axis angle of 15 arcmin . however , even at this relatively small off - axis angle , the pspc point - spread function degrades to @xmath155 arcsec ( fwhm , at 1 kev ) and there is a possibility that some clusters at the edge of the pspc fields ( where most of the survey area is ) would remain unresolved . to reduce this possible incompleteness , our optical follow - up observations",
    "are not limited to extended x - ray sources but also include likely point x - ray sources without obvious optical counterparts .",
    "the flux limit is 5.5x10@xmath2 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and the total solid angle 73 deg@xmath5 .",
    "detailed simulations were performed to derive the survey sensitivity as a function of both source flux and source extent .",
    "the survey currently contains over 150 clusters and groups of galaxies , approximately half of which are at redshifts z@xmath60.3 .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for all but a few have been obtained and the survey is complete at z@xmath70.85 .",
    "the remaining few distant cluster candidates are very probably all at higher redshifts , based on their brightest cluster galaxy magnitudes .",
    "the xlfs shown here are based on an initial analysis ; while some details will change ( eg correction for agn contamination ) in a final version , we do not expect there to be major changes .",
    "the cluster xlf is shown in fig 1 .",
    "a value of q@xmath8=0.5 has been assumed in calculating the luminosities and volumes but the results are qualitatively similar for q@xmath8=0.1 .",
    "the warps data points extend over almost 3 decades of luminosity , from 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath4 at low redshifts and up to 8x10@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) at high redshifts .",
    "there is no evidence for evolution of the xlf at any redshift up to z=0.8 when compared with the local bcs xlf @xcite , shown as a solid line .",
    "the error bars are based on a poissonian distribution of the number of clusters in each bin .",
    "the survey area for each cluster has been calculated using the cluster flux but making the simplifying assumption that all clusters have the same observed surface brightness profile ( characterised as a constant angular core radius and @xmath11=2/3 index ) .",
    "mean differences from the true survey areas are small ( @xmath710% ) .    as the xlfs at z=0.3 - 0.5 and z=0.5 - 0.85",
    "are consistent with each other , in the lower panel of the figure we have combined both redshift ranges to increase the statistical accuracy at the expense of a rather broad redshift bin .",
    "nevertheless , the small error bars on the high redshift points ( filled circles ) indicate that any evolutionary factor @xmath61.5 in the space density of moderate luminosity clusters ( 3x10@xmath12l@xmath133x10@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ) is ruled out .",
    "several recent deep x - ray clusters surveys are described in these proceedings and elsewhere . in the regime where these surveys have good statistical accuracy ( ie .",
    "moderate x - ray luminosities",
    "@xmath143x10@xmath15 - 3x10@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 ) there is a consensus that _ no evolution of the xlf is observed to z@xmath10.7_. five surveys agree on this point ( emss , rdcs , sharc , cfa , warps ) and the only disagreement ( the rixos survey @xcite ) can be understood in terms of the rixos source detection algorithm .",
    "most models of the growth of structure in the universe with @xmath0=1 predict rapid evolution of the space density of clusters of galaxies ( eg . scaling relation models @xcite or a cold+hot dark matter model @xcite ) .",
    "the tight constraints on the level of evolution allowed by the observations rules out most of the @xmath0=1 models . in models with @xmath160.3 ( with or without a cosmological constant )",
    "the predicted evolution is much less rapid and these values of @xmath0 are consistent with the lack of evolution observed .    at the higher x - ray luminosities of the most massive clusters ( l@xmath175x10@xmath10 erg s@xmath4 )",
    ", there is some disagreement between the results of different surveys as to the degree of evolution found ( if any ) , but this may partly be due to the small numbers of high luminosity clusters in any one survey .",
    "this is unfortunate , since it is the most massive clusters which have most leverage to constrain the cosmological parameters of model predictions .",
    "wide area x - ray surveys , designed to detect the rare high luminosity , massive clusters in large numbers at high redshifts ( z@xmath60.5 ) are planned ( see lumb & jones and ebeling et al in these proceedings ) .    future work will concentrate on the handful of clusters in the warps survey at z@xmath11 , on measurements of the evolution of the cluster x - ray temperature function using chandra and xmm , and studies of the butcher - oemler effect in x - ray selected clusters .",
