    "the main objective of control allocation is to determine how to generate a specified control effect from a redundant set of actuators and effectors .",
    "control effectors are devices or surfaces producing forces and moments , such as thrusters , propellers , fins or rudders , while actuators are electromechanical devices responsible to tune the magnitude , position and orientation of single effectors .",
    "due to input redundancy , several configurations leading to the same generalized force are admissible and for this reason the control allocation scheme commonly incorporates additional secondary objectives @xcite @xcite @xcite , such as power or fuel consumption minimization . on the other hand , usually there are also some limitation factors to be accounted for : actuators / effectors dynamics , input saturation and other physical or operational constraints .",
    "one further advantage of actuator and effector redundancy is the possibility to reconfigure the control in order to cope with unexpected changes on the system dynamics , such as failures or malfunctions : in particular if the set of actuators and effectors is partially affected by faults , one can modify the control allocation scheme by preventing the use of inefficient / ineffective devices in the generation of control effect or compensating for the loss of efficiency . however , one key point for successfully re - allocating the control is the availability of adequate information about the faults that have occurred ; indeed , some accurate fault estimation and/or a correct identification of the faulty actuators or effectors are necessary to address the reconfiguration .",
    "recent results toward fault tolerant control allocation are based on sliding - mode techniques @xcite @xcite and adaptive control strategies @xcite @xcite .",
    "further investigations on this topic , with a more application - oriented character , are proposed for reconfiguration in flight control @xcite , @xcite and fault accommodation in automated underwater vehicles @xcite .",
    "an interesting bibliographical survey on the general problem of fault - tolerant control reconfiguration is provided in @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to present the use of unknown input observers for fault detection / isolation and control reconfiguration in overactuated systems .",
    "unknown input observers @xcite are a very useful tool for generating robust detection filters , as they can be made insensitive to certain input space directions if some structural algebraic conditions on the system are fulfilled . due to control redundancy ,",
    "isolating faults affecting single actuators or effectors in overactuated systems can be a difficult task , as the same effects can be produced by faults occurring in different actuators or effectors : the family of filters needed to isolate the faults usually results to be larger compared to a control system framework with full - rank input matrix , and moreover there is an upper bound on the maximum number of simultaneously isolable faults . on the other hand , by constraining the inputs in prescribed configurations without altering system dynamics , control redundancy can be very helpful in separating the effects produced by multiple faults in order to identify which groups of effectors and actuators are losing effectiveness .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic setup of control allocation is introduced and the general structure of unknown input observers ( uio ) is defined ; moreover some issues related to control reconfiguration are reported , such as control re - allocation in the presence of cost functions and input constraints .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the proposed method for designing families of detection / isolation filters based on uio , namely _ constrained output fault direction _ ( cofd ) observers ; an alternative approach based on a different class of unknown input observers has recently been proposed by the authors @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 4 , the application of the theoretical results is extensively illustrated by the case study of an overactuated ship subject to thruster failures including common mode faults in thruster auxiliary systems .",
    "let us consider the following linear system @xmath0 with @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and all matrices except @xmath7 are assumed to be full - rank .",
    "the vector @xmath8 is the state , which is assumed to be not accessible for direct measurements , while @xmath9 is the measured output of the system .",
    "the vector @xmath10 represents the redundant control input and @xmath11 is the generalized control effect or virtual input . without loss of generality , the desired control effect @xmath12",
    "is assumed to be given by a suitable known function depending on the system output : [ tau - y ] _",
    "c(t)=f(y(t ) ) .",
    "the above condition can also be generalized , assuming that the desired effect @xmath13 and the measured output @xmath14 are related through a suitable dynamic law .",
    "a control allocation strategy is defined such that , whenever it is possible , the control @xmath15 satisfies [ unominal ] g u(t)=_c(t ) .",
    "although the above linear equation always admits ( uncountable ) exact solutions when @xmath16 , there are possible constraints or bounds to be met and this may lead to the existence of approximate solutions only : [ unominalcon ] \\ {    l u + gu(t)=_c(t)_c(t )",
    ". we point out that the approximate effect @xmath17 may differ from the desired one @xmath12 but it is a known quantity , as it can be computed exploiting the input constraints given by @xmath18 which is an assigned set .",
    "+ in the unconstrained case , a simple solution can be obtained using the right pseudo - inverse matrix @xcite : [ uncons ] u(t)=g^-r_c(t),g^-r:=g^t(gg^t)^-1 . in the case of constrained control @xmath19 ,",
    "several methods for control allocation are available in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the class of faults acting on effectors and actuators efficiency by changing their effectiveness : these can be modeled by a multiplicative term @xmath20 : @xmath21,\\ ] ] for some unknown functions @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that , whenever @xmath23 , the controller operates with nominal conditions and hence @xmath24 on the other hand if one of the actuators is subject to a loss of effectiveness or complete failure , i.e. if @xmath25 for some @xmath26 , the designed control law will no longer be able to ensure the desired effect , this meaning that , in the case of fault presence , one may have @xmath27 with a consequent deterioration of system performances .",
    "such problems can be avoided by accommodating the fault effects if a suitable control reconfiguration policy is considered . defining a set of diagnosis signals , usually called residuals",
    ", one can detect and isolate the faults ; then , performing the correct reconfiguration of the control input , one can track the ( approximate ) desired effect @xmath28 properly again . the approach presented in this paper",
    "is based on unknown input observers uio ( see for instance @xcite ) , whose general structure is the following:@xmath29 where the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath31 are design parameters and @xmath32 , @xmath14 are , respectively , a known reference input signal and the measured output of the system to be estimated through the observer ; the signal @xmath32 is usually set equal to the nominal and unperturbed input that is commanded to the system .",
    "it is worth to note that , in order to achieve a correct asymptotic state estimation , the matrix @xmath33 has to be hurwitz . +",
    "as it will be shown in the following , unknown input observers are useful for the task of isolating faults in overactuated systems .",
    "moreover , thanks to input redundancy , the control can be re - allocated in order to limit or avoid the use of faulty effectors / actuators once these have been isolated .",
    "on the other hand , this is not the only advantage of input redundancy in the considered framework : indeed , control allocation can be combined together with the fault isolation scheme in order to enlarge the family of identifiable faulty events",
    ". the reconfiguration can be performed by different methods , depending on several factors such as actuator dynamics , bounds on energy consumption , limited control inputs rates or other control constraints .",
    "it is worth to note that , due to the negative effects of faults , also the desired control effect @xmath12 might be requested to change with respect to the original one in order to recover the deteriorated system performances , this corresponding to update the relation between @xmath12 and the output signal @xmath14 given by ( [ tau - y ] ) .",
    "+ in the simplest case of unconstrained inputs , the nominal control allocation law is given by ( [ uncons ] ) and therefore , if the actuators @xmath34 are faulty and @xmath35 , to get the desired effect @xmath12 it is sufficient to re - allocate the control action setting @xmath36 and assigning the other components of @xmath10 , which are grouped for convenience in a vector @xmath37 , according to [ simple - realloc ] ( t)=g^-r_c(t ) , where the matrix @xmath38 is obtained from @xmath39 by neglecting the columns @xmath34",
    ". +   + on the other hand , since control reconfiguration can be regarded as a reduced - order control allocation problem in which some of the inputs are neglected , the use of the aforementioned techniques for handling input constraints can be straightforward extended . however , by turning off the input signals corresponding to faulty actuators , the redundancy of control inputs is reduced and the error between the desired control effect and the control effect provided by the approximate solution may increase after reconfiguration , as the class of admissible solutions to the allocation problem reduces .",
    "+ as already mentioned , control allocation can be used actively also to make faults observable ; in particular , by considering additional input constraints ( see section [ club ] ) which constrain control devices and surfaces to achieve common modes , one can isolate faults affecting selected groups of effectors .",
    "whenever such constraints are not allowed to be imposed simultaneously in practice due to lack of control design freedom , an iterative control allocation scheme can be defined in order to switch periodically from one common mode to another after a prescribed time interval , until the fault isolation task is accomplished successfully .",
    "the estimation error is defined as the difference between the true state @xmath40 and the estimated state @xmath41 : @xmath42 our aim is to design a family of unknown input observers @xmath43 , such that the information provided by the estimation errors allow us to detect and isolate faults . to address such target",
    "one can proceed as follows @xcite .",

    "exploiting the observer structure , the dynamics of the error is ruled by the following equation @xmath45x(t)-f\\hat x(t)\\\\   & + ( i_{n\\times n}-hc)bg\\delta(t)u(t)-rbg u(t ) .",

    "it is worth to note that a first strong design constraint for the achievability of this condition is that directions @xmath65 need to correspond to eigenvectors of the observer matrix @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , due to the rank deficiency of @xmath52 , it is not possible in general to address a decoupled distribution of the faults effects over the columns of the matrix @xmath66 and we are required to deal with linear combinations of such characteristic directions .",

    "+          in particular , it is assumed that @xmath238 and @xmath245 share the same auxiliaries , as well as @xmath246 and @xmath247 do ; the thruster @xmath248 is supposed to be equipped with a switching device that enables it to be connected arbitrarily to one sub - group or to the other , depending on the operating conditions of the system .",
    "+ using actively the control allocation , a new family of observers can be designed to obtain cluster residuals ( as showed in section [ club ] ) ; for sake of simplicity we assume the evolution time to be re - initialized at the present step .",
    "we choose the coefficients @xmath249 and @xmath250 according to the initial values of the control inputs , i.e. @xmath251 ; we impose the following conditions on the control input [ glizeta ] ^(1)u_1(t)=u_2(t ) ,  ^(2)u_3(t)=u_4(t ) ,  ^(3)u_5(t)=u_6(t ) and we set [ gliw ]      by transformation ( [ glizeta])-([gliw ] ) , each thruster @xmath252 is associated to its overall input vector @xmath253 , @xmath254 , in a scheme that corresponds to fixed directions of azimuth thrusters . a family of cofd unknown input observers @xmath255 is then defined such that the corresponding matrices @xmath100 satisfy : [ rules ]      figure [ fig8 ] illustrates the case of faults @xmath256 and @xmath257 affecting simultaneously the thrusters @xmath258 .",
    "the cluster residual @xmath259 has a negligible component along the direction @xmath243 while the other components are significant ; moreover it can be verified that all other cluster residuals have significant components along the directions @xmath69 for @xmath260 .",
    "based on the design rules ( [ rules ] ) , such information is sufficient to allow a correct identification of the pair of faulty thrusters @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "the control re - allocation can be performed through the reduced order pseudo - inverse method ( [ simple - realloc ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig5]-[fig6 ] show the evolution of the ship position in the case of a fault affecting the thruster @xmath238 ; the reconfiguration procedure is supposed to be activated after @xmath261 .",
    "the control is successfully re - allocated , and the commanded control effect is modified in order to track the original vessel velocities in surge and sway , while the rotational speed is automatically updated by the heading pid controller given by @xmath237 .",
