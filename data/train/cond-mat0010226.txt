    "bilayer quantum hall systems at total landau level filling factor @xmath0 @xcite allow for novel interlayer coherent phases .",
    "these phases have attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental attention @xcite over the last sixteen years , dating back to a seminal paper by halperin @xcite , in which the multicomponent generalization of the laughlin wavefunction was first considered in a rather general context . in particular , there is strong experimental evidence @xcite and a compelling theoretical basis @xcite to believe that a spin - polarized bilayer @xmath5 quantum hall system would have a novel spontaneous interlayer coherent incompressible phase for small values of the interlayer separation @xmath2 , even in the absence of interlayer tunneling .",
    "( we consider only the situation without any interlayer tunneling in this paper  our considerations also apply to the physical situation with weak interlayer tunneling .",
    "the situatiion with strong interlayer tunneling is trivial by virtue of the tunneling - induced symmetric - antisymmetric single - particle tunneling gap which leads to the usual @xmath0 quantum hall state in the symmetric band . ) in the limit @xmath6 , however , one expects two decoupled layers , each with @xmath5 , and hence no quantized hall state .",
    "the phase diagram for this incompressible to incompressible quantum phase transition in @xmath5 bilayer systems has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , but we still do not have a complete qualitative understanding of the detailed nature of this transition .",
    "in particular , one does not know how different kinds of incompressible ( and compressible ) phases compete as system parameters ( e.g. @xmath2 ) are tuned , and how to distinguish among possible competing incompressible phases . in this paper",
    ", we revisit this issue by arguing that , in principle , there are several interesting and nontrivial quantum hall phases in the @xmath0 bilayer system which could be systematically probed via interlayer drag experiments carried out at various values of the interlayer separation @xmath2 .    among the more interesting quantum hall phases",
    "are the so - called paired hall states , which have been extensively studied theoretically @xcite . in these states ,",
    "the composite fermions form an incompressible superconducting paired state in which two electrons composite fermions bind into effective cooper pairs which then condense into an incompressible ground state analogous to the bcs state .",
    "the well - studied moore - read pfaffian state @xcite is a spin - polarized version of such a paired hall state for a single layer system .",
    "bilayer paired hall states have been discussed earlier in the literature in the context of @xmath5 ( and @xmath7 systems ) , but no definitive idea has emerged regarding their experimental observability or their relation to the more intensively studied ( and robust ) @xmath4 state @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the current paper is to critically discuss the possible existence of a paired @xmath5 bilayer hall state which , we argue , is distinguishable from the better - studied @xmath4 incompressible state ( as well as from compressible states ) through interlayer drag experiments .",
    "given the great current interest @xcite in the phyiscs of @xmath5 bilayer systems , we believe that the results presented in this paper could shed considerable light on the nature of the possible quantum phase transitions in bilayer systems .    in sections ii , iii , and iv of this paper , we consider the possible bilayer @xmath5 quantum hall phases in the parameter regimes @xmath8 ( section ii ) , @xmath9 ( section iii ) , and @xmath10 ( section iv ) , where @xmath11 is the magnetic length , which sets the scale for intralayer correlations .",
    "we argue that the likely ground states in these three regimes are , respectively , compressible ( fermi - liquid - like ) states ( @xmath8 ) , paired hall states ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath4 states ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we conclude in section v with a critical discussion of the various drag resistivities which we argue can , in principle , distinguish among these phases and could be used to study bilayer quantum phase transitions .",
    "let us consider a bi - layer system in which each layer has filling factor @xmath13 in the limit that the layer separation @xmath2 is much larger than the typical interparticle spacing , which is of the order of the magnetic length @xmath14 . as a starting point , we will model the system by two almost independent fermi - liquid - like compressible states , one in each layer .",
    "there are two alternative and complementary descriptions of compressible states at even - denominator filling fractions .",
    "we will briefly recapitulate some features of both , as they will inform the following discussion of paired states .",
    "one description of a fermi - liquid - like compressible state at @xmath13 is based on the lowest landau level wavefunction @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 has the matrix elements @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the position of electron @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20s are parameters which are chosen so that the total energy of the system is minimized .",
    "we will discuss their interpretation below .",
    "@xmath21 projects states into the lowest landau level ; it has the following action @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the guiding center coordinates of the electrons .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction of the double - layer system at @xmath0 can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 label the two layers .",
    "the lowest landau level constraint and fermi statistics displace the electrons from the correlation holes ",
    "i.e. zeroes of the wavefunction or , equivalently , vortices represented by the @xmath26 factor in the wavefunction .",
    "the @xmath27 factor is necessary to ensure fermi statistics ; it is a displacement operator @xcite because @xmath28 acts as @xmath29 in the lowest landau level .",
    "thus the composite fermion made of an electron and two correlation holes has a dipolar structure . using these ideas ,",
    "the system can be described as a collection of dipolar ` composite fermions ' in which each dipolar fermion consists of an electron and the corresponding correlation holes @xcite . to each composite fermion",
    "we assign a @xmath20 which is equal in magnitude ( in units of @xmath14 ) and perpendicular to the displacement between the electron and its correlation holes . by fermi statistics ,",
    "the @xmath20s must be distinct .",
    "the structure of a dipolar composite fermion is given schematically in fig.1 .",
    "the energy of a composite fermion increases with @xmath20 , so the ground state is a filled fermi sea in @xmath30-space . in the long wavelength limit",
    ", the total energy of these dipolar composite fermions can be approximately written as @xmath31 with effective mass @xmath32 which is determined by the interaction potential @xcite .",
    "an alternative formulation springs from the observation that an electron may be represented by a ` composite fermion ' together with a chern - simons gauge field which attaches two fictitious flux quanta to each fermion @xcite .",
    "this representation is mathematically equivalent to the original one , but it naturally suggests a new approximation .",
    "the composite fermions see zero average magnetic field due to the cancellation between the external magnetic field and the average fictitious magnetic field coming from the fictitious flux quanta .",
    "consequently , the system can be described as an almost free ( composite ) fermion system in zero effective magnetic field . in this approach ,",
    "the fictitious flux quanta are introduced to represent the phase winding of the electron wavefunction around correlation holes associated with the positions of other electrons . the @xmath33 $ ] factor in ( [ eqn : rr_wavefcn ] )",
    "can be interpreted as the wavefunction of the almost free composite fermion system .",
    "@xcite then @xmath20s can be regarded as the `` kinetic momenta '' of the composite fermions . in the long - wavelength , low - frequency limit ,",
    "the two formulations are equivalent .",
    "we will now implement the latter formulation in a double - layer system , and show that the compressible state has a strong pairing instability @xcite .",
    "we introduce two composite fermion fields @xmath35 and two chern - simons gauge fields @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath38 with the constraints @xmath39 . @xmath40",
    "if the filling factor of each layer is @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath41 is the density disturbance measured from the average value @xmath42 .",
    "the interaction potential is given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dielectric constant .",
    "it is convenient to change the gauge field variables to @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 can be rewritten as @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 $ ] . from ( [ eqn : h_0 ] )",
    ", we see that @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same gauge `` charges '' for @xmath52 , but opposite gauge `` charges '' for @xmath53 . as a result",
    ", there will be an attractive interaction between the composite fermions in different layers via @xmath54 and a repulsive interaction via @xmath55 .",
    "composite fermions in the same layer have repulsive interactions . as a result of coulomb intractions ,",
    "the attractive interaction mediated by the @xmath54 gauge field dominates in the low energy limit and there exists a pairing instability between the composite fermions in different layers .",
    "this result can be understood in physical terms as follows .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 fields represent antisymmetric and symmetric density fluctuations . in the presence of coulomb interactions , symmetric density fluctuations",
    "are highly suppressed , but antisymmetric density fluctuations can still be large . as a result , the dynamic density fluctuations in the antisymmetric channel becomes more important in the low energy limit and lead to a pairing instability .",
    "this pairing instability has a natural explanation in the dipolar composite fermion picture @xcite .",
    "let us take a dipolar composite fermion in layer @xmath56 with wavevector @xmath57 and a dipolar composite fermion in layer @xmath58 with wavevector @xmath59 . as seen in fig.2 , this configuration can lower the interlayer coulomb energy because the electron in layer @xmath56 and the vortex in layer @xmath58 can sit on top of each other and vice versa .",
    "= 1.4 in    this analysis predicts that , at least in principle , the fermi - liquid - like compressible state is always unstable to pairing . in practice , the pairing gap will be small in the limit @xmath60 and easily destroyed by disorder . as a result , we expect the pairing instability discussed above to be relevant for @xmath61 not too small . when @xmath61 become small , on the other hand , the starting point of two decoupled compressible states is no longer sensible , and we take a different starting point , as described in later sections .    the wavefunction of the paired quantum hall state constructed in this way can be written as @xmath62 where @xmath63 \\cr & \\equiv & { \\cal a } [ f(z_1 , z_2 ; \\uparrow , \\downarrow ) f(z_3 , z_4 ; \\uparrow , \\downarrow ) \\cdots ] \\ .",

    "$ ] denotes the pfaffian , which is defined in the second line , with @xmath66 $ ] denoting the antisymmetrized product .",
    "notice that @xmath67 can be regarded as the product of the wavefunction of the paired composite fermions and that of the ( 2,2,0 ) bosonic laughlin quantum hall state .",
    "it is not immediately clear what choice of @xmath64 is most favorable energetically . in the chern - simons theory of @xcite ,",
    "there is a pairing instability in all angular momentum channels @xcite . in a modified chern - simons theory ,",
    "it was claimed that the leading instability occurs in the @xmath68-wave channel @xcite .",
    "these approximate calculations do not necessairly capture the detailed energetics which determines the pairing symmetry .",
    "hence , we will not enter into a discussion of energetics , but limit ourselves to a discussion of the simplest ( and , therefore , likeliest ) possibilities .",
    "the simplest possibility is @xmath69 pairing , @xmath70 \\prod_{i > j } ( z^{\\uparrow}_i - z^{\\uparrow}_j)^2 \\prod_{k > l } ( z^{\\downarrow}_k - z^{\\downarrow}_l)^2 \\ .\\ ] ] using the cauchy identity @xcite , @xmath71 this can be rewritten as @xmath72 thus @xmath67 is the @xmath73 state if one takes the @xmath74 pairing .",
    "this wavefunction is well - behaved in the long distance limit , but has a short distance singularity . in the presence of landau - level mixing ,",

    ", @xmath79 could be a good candidate for the paired quantum hall state represented by @xmath67 .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath67 does not have an `` interlayer josephson effect '' because there is no gapless neutral mode in the system , in contrast to the case of the @xmath4 state @xcite .",
    "we will show this later by direct calculation .",
    "another possibility for the pair wavefunction @xmath80 is the exponentially decaying function @xmath81 with a correlation length @xmath82 .",
    "this would correspond to a `` strong '' pairing state while the previous choice of @xmath83 corresponds to a `` weak '' pairing state in the terminology of of read and green @xcite .",
    "finally , the pairing wavefunction could have @xmath84-wave symmetry , which would entail a pairing form similar to ( [ eqn : other_pairing ] ) , but without the @xmath85 factor .",
    "when the layer separation becomes sufficiently small , the interlayer coulomb interaction can be comparable to or even larger than the intralayer coulomb interaction . in this case",
    ", it should be more advantageous to first form an `` interlayer '' dipolar object which consists of an electron in one layer and two vortices in the other layer , then form a paired state of these `` interlayer '' composite fermions , as shown in fig.3 . in the chern - simons formulation , this corresponds to the situation in which the electron in one layer can only see fictitious flux in the other layer .",
    "the appropriate chern - simons constraint equation are : @xmath87    as in the previous case , we can form symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the gauge fields @xmath88 and @xmath89 . again",
    ", the antisymmetric combination mediates an attractive interaction .",
    "the wavefunction of the corresponding paired quantum hall state has the following form .",
    "@xmath90 where @xmath91\\ ] ] and @xmath92 is the appropriate pair wavefunction .",
    "notice that the wavefunction @xmath93 can be regarded as the product of the wavefunction of a paired state of the composite fermions and that of the ( 0,0,2 ) bosonic laughlin quantum hall state .",
    "= 1.4 in    however , this line of thinking appears to conflict with the conventional wisdom that a bi - layer quantum hall system at @xmath94 is described by the @xmath4 state for @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the @xmath4 state , @xmath96 can be rewritten in the form @xmath97 \\prod^{n}_{i , j=1 } ( z^{\\uparrow}_i - z^{\\downarrow}_j)^2 \\ .\\ ] ] using the cauchy identity . in other words",
    ", @xmath98 is the correct choice for @xmath95 .",
    "notice that this form of @xmath99 corresponds to the ( pseudo-)spin triplet @xmath69 pairing order parameter for the `` interlayer '' composite fermions . from this point of view , it is natural to have the same pairing symmetry ( [ eqn:(3,3,-1 ) ] ) for @xmath100 but for `` intralayer '' rather than `` interlayer '' composite fermions .",
    "in the preceeding sections , we have described three possible states of a bi - layer system at @xmath94 . as one decreases the ratio of @xmath61 , we expect the following sequence of phase transitions @xmath101 the transition between @xmath102 and @xmath79 is disorder - driven since @xmath102 should never be the ground state in the presence of disorder .",
    "hence , we expect the transition to be second - order . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition between @xmath79 and @xmath103 is likely to be first order because the nature of the underlying quasiparticles changes from the `` intralayer '' composite fermions to the `` interlayer '' composite fermions and this change is not likely to be continuous .",
    "more formally , the change of the wavefunction requires a flux attachment transformation without changing the total filling factor which does not usually occur continuously . of course , disorder will eventually round the transition and make it second order .",
    "since the first order transition may be obscured by disorder , it is important to discuss experiments which can distinguish the @xmath79 and @xmath103 states . here , we propose coulomb drag experiments in which the longitudinal , @xmath104 and hall , @xmath105 , drag resistivities are used to distinguish the different phases . these may be calculated in chern - simons theory from @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the antisymmetric tensor , and @xmath110 in the compressible and @xmath73 states ( `` intralayer '' composite fermions ) while @xmath111 in the @xmath4 state ( `` interlayer '' composite fermions ) .",
    "first , consider the longitudinal drag resistivity . in the compressible state , if we neglect gauge field fluctuations , @xmath112 , so @xmath113 . including these fluctuations",
    ", it vanishes as @xmath114 at low temperatures @xcite . in @xmath103 and @xmath79 , @xmath115 and ,",
    "hence , @xmath116 vanish at zero temperature and are activated at low temperatures .",
    "now , let us consider the hall drag resistivity . in the compressible state , both terms on the right - hand - side of ( [ eqn : drag ] ) vanish , so the hall drag resistivity vanishes . in the @xmath73 state",
    ", @xmath117 is that of a @xmath69 superconductor , which has vanishing charge resistivity ( since it is a superconductor ) but quantized spin hall resistivity . in other words , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "consequently , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . in the @xmath4 state ,",
    "@xmath117 is identical , but @xmath123 is different , so @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath5 ( @xmath0 ) bilayer quantum hall system ( in the absence of interlayer tunneling ) is likely to have as its ground state a novel paired hall state ( possibly of @xmath68-wave symmetry ) for intermediate layer separations @xmath126 , which gives way to the usual @xmath4 state for smaller layer separations ( @xmath10 ) , and to compressible fermi - liquid - type states ( two decoupled halperin - lee - read @xcite @xmath5 layers ) for large layer separations ( @xmath127 ) .",
