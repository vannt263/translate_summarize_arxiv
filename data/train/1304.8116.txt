    "<S> we propose that interstellar extreme scattering events , usually observed as pulsar scintillations , may be caused by a coherent agent rather than the usually assumed turbulence of @xmath0 clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the penetration of a flux of ionizing , positively charged strangelets or quark nuggets into a dense interstellar hydrogen cloud may produce ionization trails . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the specific nature and energy of the incoming droplets , diffusive propagation or even capture in the cloud are possible . as a result , enhanced electron densities may form and constitute a lens - like scattering screen for radio pulsars and possibly for quasars .    </S>",
    "<S> a variety of scintillation phenomena observed from pulsars and quasars require interstellar scattering screens that contain compact regions of high electron density . these include quasar extreme scattering events ( ese ) @xcite , pulsar parabolic arcs @xcite and galactic center scattering of oh maser sources @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many of these phenomena , in particular the eses , require enhanced electron density regions of a.u . </S>",
    "<S> size ( @xmath1 cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overpressure @xmath2 , as estimated from typical temperatures @xmath3 and particle densities @xmath4 , is difficult to explain in any conventional scattering screens embedded in dense molecular @xmath0 clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the only plausible environment where such pressures might be attained would be in the dense cloud cores ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> the compact ionized cloud model developed by walker    @xcite ) . the required source properties in this latter model require a significant mass in extremely dense cold gas clumps to source the ionized gas . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of such cold clumps is questionable , although exotic models have been proposed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is some direct evidence that the ionized clouds are highly elongated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is an already well - known fact that plasma lenses result from electron ( over- ) under - densities . </S>",
    "<S> electron over - densities result in a faster phase velocity , corresponding to a concave ( divergent ) optical lens , while under - densities are associated with a convergent lens @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative lens models for the eses @xcite estimate electron column densities @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> here we are interested in estimating the effect of the enhancement of the electron column density on a.u . </S>",
    "<S> scales as a result of the formation of ionized trails in @xmath0 ( molecular ) and hi ( atomic ) hydrogen clouds caused by an external agent . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a mechanism that provides an alternative to postulating the existence of controversial clumps of dense molecular hydrogen , and naturally generates pervasive ionized trails in dense interstellar cloud cores . </S>",
    "<S> our model invokes strangelets @xcite ( also known as _ nuclearites _ ) , finite droplets of quark matter with non - zero strangeness fraction and slightly charged . </S>",
    "<S> they are currently being searched on earth @xcite as final products in heavy ion collisions , with the alice experiment at the lhc , in the cdmsii , under the form of light ionizing particles , or in the ams-02 mission . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that these quark droplets can be naturally generated by a series of different astrophysical events where a nucleon - quark deconfinement transition may take place , e.g. neutron star ( ns ) collisions , ns or black hole combined binary mergers or in ns to quark star ( qs ) conversions . </S>",
    "<S> this latter process may be induced by internal heating due to dark matter annihilations @xcite ( under the assumption of a majorana particle candidate ) and even leave observable traces in the pulsar distribution @xcite or in the emission of very short gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) with typical time scales @xmath6 s @xcite detectable with modern projected missions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to the large gravitational and nuclear binding energies released in the transitioning process , a mass ejection episode is expected , possibly seeding the interstellar medium with a fraction of strangeness - carrying lumps of matter formed during the phase of nucleon deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> energetics show that the measured short grbs isotropic equivalent photon emission value @xmath7 erg is compatible with relativistic mass ejecta @xmath8 able to consistently produce observable gamma rays . </S>",
    "<S> it has been actually proposed that quark matter droplets might partially populate cosmic ray ( cr ) primaries ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this context , let us consider a cloud of mixtured @xmath0 and hi . </S>",
    "<S> typical ionization reactions are of the form , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the incoming charged strangelet . in addition , </S>",
    "<S> electron capture by the positively charged strangelet could be , in principle , possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy needed to ionize a hydrogen atom ( molecule ) , initially in the ground state is @xmath12 ev ( @xmath13 ev ) . in astrophysical cgs units </S>",
    "<S> a more practical conversion factor @xmath14 erg is used . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions of the molecular cloud ( mc ) vary but the denser regions with @xmath15 @xmath16 are typically less than @xmath17 1 pc . </S>",
    "<S> assuming for the cloud core @xmath18 cm , then the core volume is @xmath19 @xmath20 . taking in the cloud core @xmath21 @xmath16 , the number of particle species ( hi , protons , electrons ) is accordingly given by @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , non - vanishing magnetic fields are expected in the mc and can be parametrized @xcite as @xmath23 @xmath24 g . in general , </S>",
    "<S> other ionizing agents , such as crs can cause ionization of @xmath0 or hi with a rate @xmath25 @xcite or @xmath26 @xcite . a more exotic flux of potentially ionizing electrically charged strangelets through the cloud will depend , on the one hand , on the time and spatial distribution of their astrophysical sources ( besides a possible primordial background ) and , on the other hand , on their peculiar nature .    we will consider a simplified model with emission of lumps of baryonic number @xmath27 and mass @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the nucleon mass . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed mass formula can be obtained from existing calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strangelet number production rate in the astrophysical ith - process will be given by @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 is the mass rate and @xmath32 is the efficiency of strangelet ejection for the ith - process involved , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for ns collisions it is expected that @xmath33 while in a ns merger the mass ejection is @xmath34 for equal - mass binaries with total mass @xmath35 @xcite . in a ns </S>",
    "<S> to qs transition capable of emitting a grb , it is expected that @xmath36 . according to @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the rate of these transitions is @xmath37 being @xmath38 @xmath39 the rate of type ii supernovae in our galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> having enumerated the possible processes that may constitute a source of the strangelet flux , for the rest of this work for practical purposes we will consider a _ </S>",
    "<S> generic source _ where the deconfinement transition can take place with galactic appearance rate @xmath40 @xmath39 and ejected mass @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the ejected mass rate is then @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> since the efficiency of strangelet production depends on the so far unknown details of the engine model , we will consider that only a small fraction @xmath43 is ejected under exotic form @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , strangelets should be emitted with a - values larger than a critical stability value @xcite , @xmath44 so that they can possibly decay to the lightest energetically stable @xmath45-species .    </S>",
    "<S> the peculiar nature of the quark droplets is highly uncertain but it is usually assumed that their charge is small and distributed positively on the surface @xcite . for ordinary strangelets @xmath46 @xcite while for cfl ( color - flavour - locked ) strangelets @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> even smaller charge - to - mass ratios are energetically possible for intermediate masses , @xmath48 , assuming a strong coupling @xmath49 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 while larger strangelets @xmath52 have @xmath53 and even @xmath54 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we constrain strangelets to have @xmath55 .    to estimate the strangelet production number rate we are going to consider scintillation from a galactic emitting generic source located at a distance @xmath56 kpc from an observer . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , pulsar simulations yield a spatial distribution peaking about galactocentric radii @xmath57 kpc and vanishing beyond @xmath1712 kpc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will also discuss the effect from a possibly nearby pulsating source @xcite @xcite at @xmath58 pc . </S>",
    "<S> then , the a - sized strangelet number galactic prodution rate at the generic source is given by @xmath59 it is expected that a possible emission distribution function at the source @xmath60 can modulate this rate . </S>",
    "<S> we will not consider this refinement here , and in what follows we will assume @xmath61 .    due to </S>",
    "<S> the fact that strangelets are electrically charged they will diffuse in the magnetized medium and the effective distance traveled over the rectilinear distance @xmath62 , is obtained as @xmath63 in a corresponding diffusive time @xmath64 . for the diffusion coefficient , @xmath65 , in the galactic halo we take @xcite    @xmath66^{1/3}$]@xmath67s@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is its height . in the mc </S>",
    "<S> larger values of the magnetic field are assumed and following @xcite , we take @xmath70^{1/2}[b/10\\,{\\rm \\mu g}]^{-1/2}$ ] @xmath67s@xmath68 with an averaged value over the mc of @xmath71 g .    </S>",
    "<S> typically , the strangelet ejection energy at a transitioning source allows lorentz factors bounded by a saturation value , @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the kinetic energy is @xmath74 so that we will assume @xmath75 droplets with a moderate @xmath76 and @xmath77 charge . in such scenario and in the universe lifetime , @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath79 sources could be expected at @xmath56 kpc . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the _ unscreened _ diffusive flux is @xmath80 and @xmath81 we must note , however , that some sources may be closer than the assumed @xmath82 kpc . in the case that @xmath83 pc @xcite then there are additional volume @xmath84 and distance @xmath85 factors yielding an estimate one order of magnitude larger than previous value ( we have roughly assumed averaged source distribution in the halo ) .    as a comparison , for strangelets being currently searched in neutrino telescopes on earth </S>",
    "<S> , there is a lower limit @xmath86 , our estimates yield in that case @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we will restrict to @xmath88 , @xmath89 droplets but larger @xmath90 are allowed if they are less energetic remaining below observational cr bounds @xmath91 ev . if the source is nearby by chance there are presently competitive limits from experiments such as antares @xcite , who report a testing capability flux @xmath92 for @xmath86 , or icecube-22 , who report @xmath93 for @xmath94 nuclearites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is however uncertain whether such large - a droplets can arrive on earth without suffering spallation or decay processes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> once the nuclearites are produced it may happen that their diffusive trajectories intersect with a mc . </S>",
    "<S> these are accumulated in the midplane of the galactic disk although we suppose that may also be present at higher latitudes . </S>",
    "<S> if the larmor radius is comparable to the typical coherence length of the galactic magnetic field , @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xcite , then a strangelet will suffer an accumulated deflection that can be estimated from random walk approximation as , @xmath97 thus , propagation effects in the galaxy or mc for moderate @xmath98 will not make possible to determine the line - of - sight direction to a distant emitting source .    in this scenario one can estimate @xmath99 , the effective number of ionizing @xmath100sized strangelets traversing the mc core in its lifetime , @xmath101 yr , as @xmath102 . since beaming </S>",
    "<S> is observed in some very short grbs ( expected in this scenario @xcite ) with opening angle @xmath103 , an efficiency factor @xmath104 has been introduced . due to the deflection effects </S>",
    "<S> we expect typically @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> using values @xmath106 kpc then @xmath107    if closer sources are considered @xcite then the mc would be illuminated , effectively , by an order of magnitude larger amount of particles as discussed previously and even higher if the source was inside the mc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as the slightly charged and heavy strangelet traverses the mc with a diffusive behaviour , continuously loses kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> strangelets of net effective charge @xmath108 may alter the cloud ionization fraction either by ionizing hydrogen or capturing electrons so that they change its own incident state of charge , as measured for massive ions on gas @xcite . for low velocities @xmath109 this may be important as it diminishes the ionizing power from the bare charge @xmath77 to an effective @xmath110 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interaction in the cloud may arise due to a variety of processes @xcite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strangelet ( kinetic ) energy loss per unit length due to ionization and pion production can be obtained from the stopping power @xmath111 . at lower energies </S>",
    "<S> , ionization is the most important process , and for an incoming particle with effective charge @xmath112 and velocity @xmath113 the energy loss rate reads @xcite @xmath114\\ , \\,\\rm ev / s,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 } { \\beta_0^{3}+2\\beta^3}{2\\beta^2},\\ ] ] and @xmath116 @xmath117 is the heaviside function , @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the electron orbital velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this function is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] versus the strangelet kinetic energy per baryon number for an @xmath120 case . </S>",
    "<S> different amounts of charge @xmath121 ( solid ) , ordinary ( dotted ) and cfl ( dot - dashed line ) strangelets and a cr proton case ( dashed line ) have been considered . for relativistic strangelets </S>",
    "<S> most of the energy is kinetic and they show an enhanced ionizing power with respect to the linear case and a change in slope around @xmath122 mev , due to pion production , for larger energies .    to estimate the hydrogen ionization rate by strangelets </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the number density of old nss in our galaxy assuming @xmath123 nss in a halo radius @xmath124 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> note that mc density is @xmath126 . in the lifetime of the mc from a rate of conversions @xmath127 </S>",
    "<S> the conversion fraction is @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore conversions are rare non - repeating events as naturally arises in this scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> having estimated the incoming strangelet flux at distance @xmath129 and the effective number of strangelets traversing the core , @xmath130 , the injection rate , @xmath131 , must take into account the fewer conversions in the mc lifetime @xmath132 where @xmath133 .    as the rate depends on the nature and energetics of the droplet it thus influences the strangelet density in the mc . </S>",
    "<S> for example , taking a diffussion escape time for a @xmath17few @xmath134 strangelet entering the mc , @xmath135 yr . in that case the strangelet number density in the mc is @xmath136 . as we have seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] some lumps may be captured in the mc lifetime and in that case @xmath137 would be a factor @xmath138 larger . for moderate a lumps , these values are much lower than the cr density at the low - energy break in the spectrum of galactic crs at @xmath139 gev , computed from the cr flux @xmath140 or @xmath141 @xcite and at @xmath139 tev , @xmath142 , @xmath143 .    </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen ionization rate due to strangelets @xmath144 _ averaged over the mc _ , is now estimated to be @xmath145 , per h atom . assuming @xmath146 ev per h ionization and heavy strangelets with @xmath147 then @xmath148\\,s^{-1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the strangelet mean free path or average range can be calculated as @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> if strangelets have charge @xmath150 their range will be smaller since they provide a more efficient ionization . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show the logarithm of the strangelet range in the cloud ( in a. u. ) as a function of the logarithm of the incoming kinetic energy per baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a proton cr case @xmath88 , ordinary and cfl strangelets with @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively , and larger strangelets with @xmath153 and @xmath154 with @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen the cloud can effectively stop the very heavy nuggets while this is not possible for the smaller droplets even at lower kinetic energies .    </S>",
    "<S> once the cloud core is populated with trails of hii ( ionized hydrogen ) , this region contains @xmath156 ions that tend to recombine radiatively as @xmath157 . </S>",
    "<S> the balance between ionization and recombination determines the ionized fraction . to estimate the possibility of a net ionization in the hi cloud one must compare the ionization and recombination times , @xmath158 and @xmath159 respectively , so that @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> if recombination is slower , there would be a net amount of ionized hi in the cloud to cause an electron density enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there might be a fraction of net charge due to the accumulation of positively charged lumps stopped by the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the recombination time , @xmath159 , is calculated in the _ on the spot _ approximation as @xmath161 where we take @xmath162 k and @xmath163 is the electron number density . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the average ionization time from the average number of ionizations in the cloud lifetime as @xmath164 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath165 then it is indeed possible to obtain net ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization of interest for the eses occurs along the trajectory , that spans the mc , but only over a trajectory width given by the product of hydrogen recombination time and sound speed , @xmath166 , namely at @xmath167 @xmath168 , where @xmath169 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the local ionization rate is increased by a factor @xmath170 at tev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath171 yields an electron density of @xmath172 . </S>",
    "<S> typical ese events have been argued to be explained by localized and dense plasma structures @xcite of length comparable to trail widths of @xmath173 cm for densities @xmath174 typical in dense cores . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement in the column density coming from the ionization produced by the incoming particles is estimated as @xmath175 . then for a typical heavy species with energies of tev that is stopped in the cloud the accumulated enhancement over the cloud lifetime for @xmath176 is @xmath177 as required by these scattering events .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that pulsar scintillations may be caused by an ionization agent constituted by positively charged lumps of strange matter . </S>",
    "<S> typical obtained over - densities in electron column densities are compatible with those of quantitative ese models . </S>",
    "<S> compact a. u. sized regions are involved in the geometry of these events . </S>",
