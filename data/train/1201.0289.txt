    "variability is a characteristic property of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it is believed that the majority of agns exhibit rapid and apparently random variability over a wide wavelength band that ranges from x - ray to radio wavelengths .",
    "characteristic variability timescales range from months to years .",
    "variability is a powerful feature for constraining physical models and has the potential to probe the structure and dynamics of the central engine .",
    "it is widely accepted that accretion disk instabilities represent a promising model for explaining the variability properties of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , several possible models have been proposed to explain the observed optical variability : multiple supernovae @xcite or starburst @xcite close to the nucleus , star collisions @xcite , and gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "a powerful approach for discerning these models is to examine correlations between variability and a physical parameter ( such as time lag , luminosity , rest - frame wavelength , or redshift ) .",
    "these observational correlations have been associated with correlations predicted by physical models , and the appropriate model for the variability mechanism of agns has often been discussed .",
    "there are two main approaches to examine the variability of agns .",
    "the first is to monitor a relatively small sample of agns over a period of time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using an observed light curve for an agn ,",
    "various variability properties for the object were studied .",
    "the second approach is to examine the ensemble variability @xmath0 of a larger number of agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach can be accomplished even if there are only two sampling epochs .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the ensemble variability of 25,000 quasars in the sdss catalog using two sampling epochs and established several correlations between the optical variability and time lag , luminosity , rest - frame wavelength , and redshift . in the near - infrared",
    ", @xcite studied the near - infrared variability of individual quasars using a sample of 108 optically selected quasars .",
    "in addition , near - infrared ensemble variability is reported by @xcite .",
    "they presented correlations between near - infrared variability and several physical parameters by studying a sample of 226 agns . whereas numerous studies have been dedicated to examining the optical variability ( especially to establish a correlation between optical variability and a physical parameter ) , a few studies have focused on the near - infrared variability .    in this paper , we present the optical and near - infrared ensemble variability in the rest - frame for a sample of about 5,000 agns , which are probably mostly quasars , by using archival three near - infrared catalogs and two agn catalogs .",
    "the catalogs used in this paper are introduced in section [ data ] . in section",
    "[ selection ] , we describe the method for extracting near - infrared counterparts for cataloged agns and the criterion for selecting near - infrared variable agns . in section",
    "[ analysis ] , we show correlations of the ensemble variability with rest - frame wavelength , redshift , luminosity , and rest - frame time lag .",
    "we also show the variability properties correlated with optical variability , radio intensity , and radio - to - optical flux ratio .",
    "finally , we discuss both the intrinsic optical and near - infrared variability properties in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite is a project that observed 99.998% of the whole sky at the j ( 1.25 @xmath1 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath1 m ) , and ks ( 2.16 @xmath1 m ) bands , from mt .",

    "the point source catalog ( psc ) was produced using these images and contains 470,992,970 sources .",

    "the uncertainties in the profile - fit photometry take into account the psf shape , using a measurement - noise model that includes the effects of read noise , poisson noise , and psf error .      the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ) is a survey of the southern sky done between 1995 and 2001 in two near - infrared bands ( j : @xmath8 @xmath1 m and k@xmath6 : @xmath9 @xmath1 m ) and one optical band ( i : @xmath10 @xmath1 m ) .",

    ", we call the sample of variable agns selected in the j band ( k band ) as the j selection ( k selection ) or j - selected ( k - selected ) sample and call the sample derived from the denis ( ukidss ) catalog in the j selection ( k selection ) the denis ( ukidss)-j ( k ) sample .    using the redshifts listed in the agn catalogs",

    "redshift versus absolute magnitude relations are shown in figure [ z - m ] .",
    "since we have only two sampling epochs for each agn , the magnitude difference does not directly reflect the characteristic amplitude of intrinsic variability . in this case",
    ", the ensemble variability can be useful to examine the variability of agn ensembles .    here",
    ", we define the ensemble variability as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of variable agns , and @xmath31 the error in @xmath0 is represented by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the measurement uncertainty .",
    "these are essentially the same definitions as used by @xcite .",
    "we derive the ensemble variability for each physical parameter bin ( i.e. , rest - frame wavelength , redshift , absolute magnitude , and rest - frame time lag ) .",
    "accordingly , the ensemble variability will be a function of a physical value .",
    "below , we examine the correlations between the ensemble variability and the physical parameters .",
    "quasar variability is known to be related to the rest - frame wavelength . in the optical ,",
    "many previous studies have demonstrated that the variability decreases with increasing rest - frame wavelength @xcite .",
    "in addition , anticorrelation has been established to span at least from the ultraviolet to near - infrared @xcite .",
    "figure [ restwavelength - variability ] shows variability as a function of rest - frame wavelength .",
    "for all the samples , a clear trend in the ensemble variability is to decrease with increasing rest - frame wavelength in the near - infrared ( i.e. , @xmath34 ) .",
    "although the data points for the denis - k sample are unreliable in the range of @xmath35 because of low statistics , an anticorrelation over at least @xmath36 is clearly evident .",
    "this general trend suggests that the anticorrelation between variability and rest - wavelength is established not only in the optical but also in the near - infrared .",
    "conversely , in the optical ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , variability appears to increase with increasing rest - frame wavelength .",
    "a turnover can be seen around @xmath38 in the denis - j sample .",
    "this is significant because the spearman rank - correlation coefficient is 0.891 ( @xmath39 ) for the positive ( negative ) slope in @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , with the significant at 99% ( 91% ) confidence level .",
    "only the ukidss - j sample shows a moderately flat curve .",
    "these trends in the optical are inconsistent with previous studies .",
    "a possible cause of these conflicting results is biased sampling of high - redshift agns .",
    "agns with higher redshifts become more difficult to detect because their apparent magnitudes should be more faint .",
    "even if an agn could be detected at its brighter phase , the magnitude is expected to be near the limiting magnitudes of the near - infrared catalogs . in most cases ,",
    "the faint - phase magnitude of the agn is expected to be fainter than the limiting magnitudes . because we selected variable agns by comparing only double - epoch magnitudes",
    ", we will not be able to , in such a case , extract the agn as a variable source .",
    "in particular , agns having larger variability tend to fall into this situation and therefore can not be selected as variable agns .",
    "accordingly , we could not extract variable agns having large variability amplitudes even if such agns exist , and most variable agns we could extract should have relatively small variability amplitudes . because agns with higher redshifts are detected at shorter wavelengths in the rest - frame for a fixed passband in the observer - frame , this biased sampling would especially affect the correlation at shorter optical wavelengths .",
    "indeed , the steeper slope for the denis - j sample than that for the ukidss - j sample can be interpreted as the difference between limiting magnitudes .",
    "the denis can not detect fainter agns in the same way as the ukidss , because the limiting magnitudes of the denis are brighter than that of the ukidss . as a result , at shorter rest - frame wavelengths , the number of high - redshift agns showing large variability in the denis - j sample becomes smaller than that in the ukidss - j sample due to the above - mentioned biased sampling .",
    "this might cause the steeper slope in the denis - j sample .",
    "correlations between redshift and variability are shown in figure [ redshift - variability ] . in the ukidss - j sample",
    ", variability increases with increasing redshift below @xmath42 .",
    "the denis - j sample also shows an increase similar to that of the ukidss - j sample .",
    "however , the slopes appear to change significantly around @xmath43@xmath44 . above @xmath42 , there seems to be an anticorrelation in both samples , although many data points are unreliable because of the small number of objects contributing to the data ( this is especially true for the denis - j sample ) .",
    "the j - band wavelength in the observer - frame corresponds to a wavelength of 0.700.78 @xmath1 m in the rest - frame at @xmath45@xmath44 .",
    "this is a near boundary wavelength between the optical and the near - infrared regions .",
    "the k - selected samples also show a property similar to the j - selected samples .",
    "the ukidss - k sample shows a positive correlation below @xmath46 . in the rest - frame at this redshift",
    ", the k - band wavelength in the observer - frame also corresponds to a near boundary wavelength between the optical and the near - infrared . beyond @xmath46 , there seems to be a negative correlation .",
    "no trend can be found in the denis - k sample because most data points are scattered because of the statistically small number of data at each point .",
    "@xcite reported that the sample of radio - loud agns shows a positive correlation between near - infrared variability and redshift , whereas the sample of radio - quiet agns shows a negative correlation . according to their correlations , our sample agns",
    "exhibit a property similar to their radio - loud agns .",
    "note that the correlations of variability with redshift can be interpreted as an anticorrelation between wavelength and variability @xcite . in other words , for a fixed passband in the observer - frame , agns with larger redshifts are detected at shorter wavelengths , which have systematically large fluctuations . in this case",
    ", the correlation of variability with redshift does not reflect evolutionary effects .",
    "therefore , the variations in the slope near the boundary wavelength between the optical and near - infrared should be intrinsic to the variations in the slope mentioned in section [ rest - frame - wavelength ] .      as shown above , the intrinsic variability properties in the optical appear to be different from those in the near - infrared .",
    "consequently , in what follows , we divide our j - selected ( k - selected ) samples into two subsets according to whether an object s redshift is @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) .",
    "these boundary redshifts correspond to a rest - frame wavelength of about @xmath44 @xmath1 m , which is a near boundary wavelength between the optical and near - infrared .",
    "when the redshift of an object is larger than the boundary redshift ( i.e. , @xmath51 or @xmath52 for j- or k - selected samples , respectively ) , the variability of the object represents the intrinsic optical variability .",
    "figure [ m - variability ] shows correlations between absolute magnitude ( luminosity ) and ensemble variability . for `` all '' of the j - selected samples ( see bottom - row panels in figure [ m - variability ] )",
    ", a broad peak appears roughly at @xmath53 . in other words , the ensemble variability increases with decreasing absolute magnitude (",
    "i.e. , negative correlation ) for @xmath54 , whereas there is positive correlation for @xmath55 .",
    "as can be seen from the middle- and top - row panels in figure [ m - variability ] , the slope variations are caused by a difference in variability between the optical and the near - infrared .",
    "the k - selected samples also show similar trends ; that is , a negative correlation appears in the near - infrared ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) samples whereas a positive correlation appears in the optical ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) samples .",
    "various studies have confirmed that the optical variability of quasars is anticorrelated with luminosity @xcite , which indicates that more - luminous quasars exhibit smaller variability .",
    "the optical variability of our samples is consistent with these analyses .    in poissonian models",
    ", the following relationship is expected between fractional optical variability @xmath57 and mean luminosity @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ v - l ] ) is equivalent to @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the absolute magnitude and @xmath63 is a constant . using this relationship , we measure , by weighted least square fits ,",
    "@xmath64 0.096 ( denis - j ) , 0.080 ( ukidss - j ) , 0.396 ( denis - k ) , and 0.167 ( ukidss - k ) .",
    "only the denis - k sample has a steeper slope , which is considerably steeper than the other three samples . despite this result",
    ", we expect the denis - k slope to be less reliable than the others because it is calculated from only two data points .",
    "the slopes of the other three samples are less than 0.2 , which is inconsistent with the poissonian prediction .",
    "additionally , the three slopes are also less than such as @xmath65 @xcite and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we consider it highly probable that the more - level slopes are due to the same cause as mentioned in section [ rest - frame - wavelength ] ; namely , to a biased sampling of large - redshift agns .",
    "in contrast with the optical correlations , the near - infrared variability is negatively correlated with absolute magnitude for the whole sample .",
    "the slope of each sample is @xmath67 ( denis - j ) , @xmath68 ( ukidss - j ) , @xmath69 ( denis - k ) , and @xmath70 ( ukidss - k ) .",
    "in addition , these negative correlations are also qualitatively consistent with the trend of radio - loud agns reported by @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared correlations can be explained by the calculations of @xcite , which predict that thinner tori have larger near - infrared variability amplitudes ( see figure 10 in their paper ) .",
    "assuming more luminous agns have thinner tori [ i.e. , the receding torus model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] , their model implies that more - luminous agns have larger near - infrared variability .      the ensemble variability as a function of rest - frame time lag is identical to the structure function ( sf ) .",
    "the sf has been used to study both individual quasars and quasar ensembles and is useful for understanding the timescales of the relevant variability processes .",
    "the logarithmic slope ( @xmath71 ) of the sf can be an indicator for discriminating physical models and is described as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the rest - frame time lag with the time dilation effect caused by cosmic expansion , taken into account .",
    "the rest - frame time lag is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the time lag in the observer - frame .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath71 values by constructing theoretical models .",
    "their results are @xmath76@xmath77 in the starburst model and @xmath78@xmath79 in the disk instability model . additionally , by using a microlensing model , @xcite predicted @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ sf ] shows the sf for each sample . as done in section [ absolute - magnitude ] , the samples are divided into subsets according to the redshift . in the optical",
    ", the ensemble variability tends to increase with increasing rest - frame time lag for the ukidss - j and ukidss - k samples .",
    "the logarithmic slopes of these samples are computed by weighted least square fits to be @xmath81 ( ukidss - j ) and @xmath82 ( ukidss - k ) , respectively .",
    "several studies have shown that the sf in the optical increases steadily for @xmath83@xmath84 yr and becomes relatively constant for larger time lags @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we attribute the more - level slope in the ukidss - j sample to the difference in time ranges . in other words ,",
    "the slope of the sf of the ukidss - j sample is expected to be less than that of the ukidss - k sample because a majority of the data in the ukidss - j sample have time lags longer than @xmath85@xmath84 yr whereas a majority of the data in the ukidss - k sample have time lags shorter than @xmath85@xmath84 yr .",
    "meanwhile , the results for the denis samples are inconsistent with those from both the ukidss samples and previous studies .",
    "although the ensemble variability of the denis - j sample decreases with increasing rest - frame time lag , the number of objects in the denis - j sample is considerably smaller than that in the ukidss - j sample .",
    "the denis - k sample , with @xmath50 , has a notably smaller number of objects than the other samples .",
    "therefore , we expect the results derived from the denis samples to be less reliable than those derived from the ukidss samples .    in contrast , in the near - infrared , the ensemble variability of all samples appears to be anticorrelated with the rest - frame time lag .",
    "the logarithmic slopes @xmath71 are @xmath86 ( denis - j ) , @xmath87 ( ukidss - j ) , @xmath88 ( denis - k ) , and @xmath89 ( ukidss - k ) .",
    "even the denis samples show negative correlations with the rest - frame time lag , despite their being relatively unreliable because of the same reason mentioned in the above .",
    "if these trends are real , then figure [ sf ] shows that the decrease is moderate at shorter time lags ( @xmath90 ) whereas the decrease is steep at larger time lags ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we further discuss the near - infrared sfs in section [ discussion ] .",

    "we examine here a correlation between optical variability and near - infrared variability .",

    "although these levels are insufficient , there might be a weak correlation in each sample .",

    "figure [ f20-variability ] shows radio flux at 20 cm versus near - infrared variability amplitude .",

    "the spearman rank - correlation coefficients for the samples are 0.346 ( denis - j ) , 0.242 ( ukidss - j ) , 0.235 ( denis - k ) , and 0.270 ( ukidss - k ) .",

    "several studies have reported that radio - loud quasars tend to be more variable than radio - quiet quasars , although the optical variability of simple radio - detected quasars is not significantly different from that of radio - undetected quasars @xcite .",
    "our samples confirm these trends in the correlation between radio intensity and near - infrared variability amplitude .",

    "both radio and optical fluxes are taken from the sq catalog .",

    "theoretical calculations for near - infrared variability of agns predict larger variability amplitude for orientations closer to the pole - on view @xcite .",
    "if the radio emission of our agn sample originates in ( short or small ) jets , then the radio intensity is likely to be correlated with the viewing angle in the sense that intense emission is associated to nearly pole - on view .",
    "thus , the correlation between the near - infrared variability amplitude and the radio intensity that we discovered in this study is consistent with this prediction .",
    "the intrinsic optical variability in both the denis and ukidss samples is inconsistent with the well - known negative correlation between rest - frame wavelength and variability . as mentioned in section [ rest - frame - wavelength ] , this is probably due to a biased sampling of high - redshift agns .",
    "however , the optical variability of the ukidss samples exhibit positive correlation with both the absolute magnitude and rest - frame time lag , which is consistent with previous analyses . on the other hand , although the absolute magnitude of the denis samples exhibit positive correlation with optical variability , the sf appears to be inconsistent with previous analyses .",
    "therefore , compared with the denis samples , the ukidss samples strongly reflect the intrinsic properties of the optical variability for agns .",
    "we attribute the result that the variability properties of the ukidss samples are more consistent than those of the denis samples to the following reasons : first , the ukidss samples contain significantly more number of objects ( over three times more ; see table [ variable - number ] ) than the denis samples contain , and a statistically small number of objects increases errors .",
    "second , photometric errors of the ukidss samples are roughly five times lesser than those of the denis samples . consequently , both statistically and photometrically , the ukidss samples should be more reliable than the denis samples .",
    "the near - infrared variability is anticorrelated with rest - frame wavelength , which is consistent with previous suggestions",
    ". meanwhile , the near - infrared variability is anticorrelated with both absolute magnitude and rest - frame time lag , which are the opposite of these correlations of the optical variability . as mentioned in section [ absolute - magnitude ] ,",
    "a subset of these correlations are consistent with the radio - loud agns reported by @xcite . despite the different optical properties between the denis and ukidss samples , both show similar near - infrared variability properties .",
    "we focus here on the near - infrared sfs of our samples .",
    "the difference between the optical sf and the near - infrared sf is evident from figure [ sf ] .",
    "contrary to the optical sfs , the near - infrared sfs exhibit negative correlations .",
    "in particular , the ukidss samples show strong anticorrelations over @xmath161000 days .",
    "note that the first - order sf is related to the autocorrelation function as follows @xcite : @xmath100,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the variance of a process and @xmath102 is the autocorrelation function with @xmath103 . in this scheme",
    ", a negative sf slope indicates that the autocorrelation function increases with increasing rest - frame time lag .",
    "accordingly , our samples imply that the near - infrared variability exhibits more periodic fluctuations on a longer time scale ( up to @xmath1610 yr ) .",
    "this anticorrelation can be seen in the sfs of several quasars in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several quasars in their samples show sfs that decrease over a period of 35 yr . in particular , the sf for quasar",
    "pg 1226 + 023 is apparent .",
    "our ukidss samples are consistent with this property . @xcite",
    "also insist that there is `` periodic '' ( sinusoidal - like ) behavior over nearly a decade in the j , h , and k bands and suggest that this periodic behavior is a feature of the nonthermal engine of the radio - loud quasars .",
    "the peak near 35 yr that is seen in quasar pg 1226 + 023 appears to be found in the ukidss - k sample .",
    "therefore , the sfs for the ukidss samples also show a periodic property similar to that found for radio - loud quasars , which is consistent with the analyses in sections [ redshift ] and [ absolute - magnitude ] .",
    "we have examined the ensemble variability of over 5,000 near - infrared luminous agns extracted from two agn catalogs .",
    "the sample agns are divided into subsets according to whether , in the rest - frame , the near - infrared emission or the optical emission is at the origin of the near - infrared light , and we have demonstrated the dependence of intrinsic optical / near - infrared variability on rest - frame wavelength , redshift , absolute magnitude , and rest - frame time lag ( i.e. , structure function ) .",
    "the correlations of the optical variability with absolute magnitude and rest - frame time lag are qualitatively consistent with previous analyses , whereas the optical variability is inconsistent with the well - known negative correlation of optical variability with rest - frame wavelength . the inconsistencies in the optical variability properties reported herein and those found in previous analyses are probably due to a biased sampling of high - redshift agns .",
    "furthermore , compared to the denis samples , the ukidss samples reflect known properties of the optical variability .",
    "however , the near - infrared variability is negatively correlated with the rest - frame wavelength , as has been suggested by previous studies .",
    "nevertheless , it is notable that the near - infrared variability is anticorrelated with both the absolute magnitude and rest - frame time lag , which are opposite to the correlations with optical variability .",
    "the anticorrelation with absolute magnitude can be explained by the near - infrared emission from tori by using the theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "the anticorrelation in the sfs should indicate that the near - infrared variability is more periodic over a longer time scale ( up to @xmath1610 yr ) .",
    "the detailed physical process behind the near - infrared variability needs to be revealed . by comparing the properties of our samples with the properties of samples from @xcite and @xcite , we find that the general properties of the near - infrared ensemble variability are similar to the properties of radio - loud quasars .",
    "in addition , we examined the dependence of the near - infrared variability amplitude on optical variability , radio intensity , and radio - to - optical flux ratio .",
    "although a subset of our samples indicates that the optical variability is positively ( negatively ) correlated with variability amplitude at the j ( k ) band , these correlations might not be significant .",
    "the near - infrared variability amplitude tends to increase with increasing radio intensity and radio - to - optical flux ratio , and this positive correlation with radio intensity tends to be stronger in the range of @xmath1040.1 jy .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
