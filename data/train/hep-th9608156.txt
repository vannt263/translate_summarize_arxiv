    "then we draw a line connecting @xmath173 and @xmath175 which enclose @xmath177-th legs so that it represents that the legs inside the loop are traced . then , it is easy to see which terms generate which color structures",
    ". obviously , given such a diagram , we get the same subtrace structure from diagrams made by altering the relative order of trees belonging to different sets while keeping the order of @xmath178 and the cyclic order of @xmath179 ( fig.2 ) .",
