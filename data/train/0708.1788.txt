    "the reionization of cosmic hydrogen , which is commonly believed to have been due to ultraviolet photons produced by the first stars and quasars ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) , was an important milestone in the history of the universe . the recent discovery of very distant quasars has enabled detailed studies of the ionization state of the high redshift igm to be made at a time when the universe was less than a billion years old ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ; white et al .",
    "several studies have used the evolution of the ionizing background inferred from these spectra to argue that the reionization of cosmic hydrogen was completed just beyond @xmath10 ( white et al .",
    "2003 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 ; gnedin & fan  2006 ) .",
    "however other authors have claimed that the evidence for this rapid change becomes significantly weaker for a different choice density distribution in the igm ( becker et al  2007 ) .",
    "one reason for the ambiguity in interpreting these absorption spectra is that ly@xmath0   absorption can only be used to probe neutral fractions that are larger than @xmath2 , owing to the large cross - section of the ly@xmath0   resonance .",
    "several of the most distant quasars exhibit complete gunn - peterson troughs , the red edges of which do not extend as far as the redshifted ly@xmath0 wavelength .",
    "a possible interpretation of the observation of a gunn - peterson trough which does not extend all the way to the ly@xmath0 wavelength is the presence of an h   region in a partially neutral igm ( e.g. cen & haiman  2000 , madau & rees  2000 ) .",
    "this interpretation has been used in different ways to argue that there is a significant fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm beyond @xmath1 ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ; mesinger & haiman  2004 ; wyithe , loeb & carilli  2005 ) , with a lower limit on the hydrogen neutral fraction that is as much as two orders of magnitude larger than constraints available from direct absorption studies .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) , maselli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and lidz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , however , have argued that this interpretation is uncertain and that these observed regions of transmission could either be due to an h   region or due to a classical proximity zone .",
    "given this uncertainty , and in order to connect the evolution of the igm ionization state at redshifts both above and below those where the gunn - peterson troughs have been observed , fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) proposed defining the sizes of these regions of transmission as the distance where the smoothed spectrum first drops below the level where 10 per cent of the flux is transmitted .",
    "bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) refer to this region as the highly ionized near - zone , and fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that its size should reflect the ionization state of the igm in a simple way . using this definition , fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a rapid trend of near - zone size with redshift , from which they inferred an order of magnitude increase in the neutral fraction of the igm over the observed range of @xmath11 .",
    "however bolton & haehnelt  ( 2007a ) demonstrated that the near - zone size becomes independent of the neutral hydrogen fraction when the igm is highly ionized .",
    "in this paper we shall address two points regarding the interpretation of the near - zones observed in high redshift quasar absorption spectra . as pointed out recently by lidz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and alvarez & abel ( 2007 ) , the quasars observed prior to @xmath1 are likely to have formed in regions substantially preionized by nearby clustered galaxies .",
    "we therefore first discuss the extent to which regions of the igm observed close to high redshift quasars in absorption spectra are representative of the universe on average , using a density dependent semi - analytic model for the reionization history .",
    "this model is carefully calibrated to be consistent with the current observational data , and as such provides a consistent theoretical framework for modeling quasar near - zones in highly biased regions of the igm .",
    "we then use this model to predict the sizes of quasar near - zones and their evolution with redshift , both semi - analytically and using detailed simulations of radiative transfer .",
    "we begin by describing our density dependent semi - analytic model for the reionization history (   [ models ] ) , including our procedures for the calculation of the ionizing background .",
    "we then present results for the bias of reionization near quasars in   [ results ] , before discussing the evolution of the observed high redshift quasar near - zones using the semi - analytic model in   [ nearzones ] .",
    "we then explore this model in more detail with full radiative transfer simulations in ",
    "[ sec : sims ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in   [ conclusions ] . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the set of cosmological parameters determined by _ wmap _ ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) for a flat @xmath12cdm universe .",
    "miralda - escude et al .  ( 2000 ) presented a model which allows the calculation of an effective recombination rate in an inhomogeneous universe by assuming a maximum overdensity ( @xmath13 ) which may be penetrated by ionizing photons within h   regions .",
    "the model assumes that reionization progresses rapidly through islands of lower density prior to the overlap of individual ionized regions .",
    "following overlap , the remaining regions of high density are gradually ionized .",
    "it is therefore hypothesised that at any time , regions with gas below some critical normalised density threshold @xmath14 are ionized while regions of higher density are not . in what follows ,",
    "we draw primarily from their prescription and refer the reader to the original paper for a detailed discussion of its motivations and assumptions .",
    "wyithe & loeb  ( 2003 ) employed this prescription within a semi - analytic model of reionization . in the current work we limit our attention to reionization due to population - ii stars ( gnedin & fan  2006 ; srbinovsky & wyithe  2006 ) , which govern the final stages of reionization even in the presence of an earlier partial or full reionization by population iii stars ( e.g. wyithe & loeb  2003 ) .    within the model of miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we describe the post - overlap evolution of the igm by computing the evolution of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fraction of mass in regions with overdensity below @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the volume weighted probability distribution for @xmath19 . in a region of large scale over density @xmath20 at @xmath21 , the mass fraction @xmath22 ( or equivalently @xmath17 ) therefore evolves according to the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the growth factor , @xmath25 is the case b recombination coefficient , @xmath26 is the comoving electron density , and @xmath27 is the effective clumping factor of the igm ( see below ) .",
    "this equation was described in wyithe & loeb  ( 2003 ) , but it is generalised in this work to apply to regions of large scale overdensity @xmath20 that differ from the average igm .",
    "integration of equation  ( [ postoverlap ] ) requires knowledge of @xmath18 .",

    "they assume @xmath34 and solve for @xmath35 and @xmath36 by requiring the mass and volume to be normalised to unity .",
    "we repeat this procedure to find @xmath18 at higher redshifts .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath37 to the scale factor is expected for the growth of structure in an @xmath38 universe or at high redshift otherwise , and its amplitude should depend on the amplitude of the power - spectrum . the simulations on which the distribution in miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was based assumed @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , close to the values used in this paper .",
    "the above probability distribution remains a reasonable description at high redshift when confronted with a more modern cosmology and updated simulations , although the addition of an analytical approximation for the high density tail of the distribution remains necessary as a best guess at correcting for numerical resolution ( bolton & haehnelt  2007b ) .",
    "equation  ( [ postoverlap ] ) provides a good description of the evolution of the ionization fraction following the overlap of individual ionized bubbles because the ionization fronts are exposed to the mean ionizing radiation field .",
    "however prior to overlap , the prescription is inadequate due to the large fluctuations in the intensity of the ionizing radiation .",
    "a more accurate model to describe the evolution of the ionized volume prior to overlap was suggested by miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in our notation",
    "the appropriate equation is @xmath42}{dz } & = & \\frac{1}{n^0}\\frac{dn_{\\gamma}(\\delta)}{dz}\\\\ & & \\hspace{-25mm}- \\alpha_{\\rm b}(1+z)^3r(\\delta_{\\rm crit})n_{\\rm e}\\left(1+\\delta\\frac{d(z)}{d(z_{\\rm obs})}\\right)q_{\\rm i}\\frac{dt}{dz}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath43\\frac{q_{\\rm i}}{f_{\\rm m}(\\delta_{\\rm c})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath44 is redefined to be the volume filling factor within which all matter at densities below @xmath45 has been ionized .",
    "the effective clumping of the igm can now be written @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fraction of the volume with @xmath48 .",
    "within this formalism , the epoch of overlap is precisely defined as the time when @xmath44 reaches unity .",
    "however , we have only a single equation to describe the evolution of two independent quantities @xmath44 and @xmath49 . the relative growth of these depends on the luminosity function and spatial distribution of the sources .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath45 is set by the mean separation of the ionizing photon sources .",
    "more numerous sources can attain overlap for smaller values of @xmath45 .",
    "we assume @xmath45 to be constant with redshift before overlap with values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( which lie in the range for galaxies ) in this paper , and show examples for both .",
    "our approach is to compute a reionization history given a particular value of @xmath45 , combined with assumed values for the efficiency of star - formation and the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from galaxies . with this history in place",
    "we then compute the evolution of the background radiation field due to these same sources .",
    "post overlap , ionizing photons will experience attenuation due to residual overdense pockets of h gas .",
    "we use the description of miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to estimate the ionizing photon mean - free - path , and subsequently derive the attenuation of ionizing photons .",
    "we then compute the flux at the _",
    "lyman limit _  ( @xmath52  @xmath53 in the igm due to sources immediate to each epoch , in addition to redshifted contributions from earlier epochs .",
    "this calculation follows the model described in srbinovsky & wyithe  ( 2006 ) [ see also choudhury & ferrara  2005 ] but is summarised below .",
    "we note that h lyman limit photons @xmath54 are incapable of ionizing helium ( he ) [ @xmath55 ( he ) , @xmath56 ( he ) ] .",
    "we therefore neglect he when computing the intensity of the ionizing background in our semi - analytic model .      in this section",
    "we review the process for calculating the ionizing background flux at a particular redshift .",
    "we assume the post overlap ionizing background to be generated by population - ii stars alone following the results of srbinovsky & wyithe  ( 2006 ) .",
    "we first define @xmath57 to be the redshift at which the flux is to be evaluated .",
    "the flux at the lyman limit is normalised in _",
    "physical _ units of @xmath58 @xmath59 , and at redshift @xmath57 it is related to the energy density by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the speed of light and @xmath62 is the energy per unit frequency interval per unit co - moving volume at frequency @xmath52 and redshift @xmath57 .",
    "contributions to the radiation field at @xmath52 ( and @xmath57 ) from sources at redshift @xmath63 were emitted at frequency @xmath64   @xmath65@xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath64 remains below the he lyman limit @xmath66 whilst @xmath67 .",
    "the semi - analytic model of the reionization history predicts an average redshift of overlap , which we refer to as @xmath68 .",
    "the ionizing background flux contains contributions from sources at @xmath57 in addition to redshifted flux from sources at higher redshift . to compute the ionizing background flux we consider contributions from sources with redshifts @xmath69 .",
    "the total co - moving energy density at redshift @xmath57 is @xmath70    the term @xmath71 represents the frequency dependent ( co - moving ) energy density per unit time generated by ionizing sources , and @xmath72 is the optical depth for ionizing photons between @xmath63 and @xmath57 . rather than assume the complete attenuation of ionizing photons emitted prior to the redshift of overlap , we instead assume attenuation due to the mean - free - path evaluated in ionized regions prior to overlap and weight the contribution to the energy density by @xmath44 .",
    "this approach should approximate the contribution of sources to the ionizing background that emit at redshifts late in the overlap epoch when the typical bubble size is evolving rapidly , and is much larger than the ionizing photon mean - free - path ( furlanetto , zaldarriaga & hernquist  2004 ) .",
    "finally , the photoionization rate may be related to the observed ionizing background flux using @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the h photo - ionization _ cross - section _ and @xmath75 is planck s constant . using equation  ( [ gamma ] ) and the spectra describing our sources , we find . ]",
    "@xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the ionizing rate in units of @xmath78 ) for a background in which stars are the dominant source .",
    "this last step does not account for the variation of the spectral shape ( due to redshifting ) from that emitted at a constant time .",
    "we next describe the contribution to the ionizing background flux made by population - ii stars . to begin , we describe the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of population - ii star forming galaxies , using the model presented in leitherer et al .",
    "the sed has the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is expressed in units of ( baryonic ) solar masses per year .",
    "in the instance that ionizing photons are produced primarily in star bursts , with lifetimes much shorter than the hubble time , we may express the star formation rate per unit time as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the co - moving baryonic mass density , and @xmath83 is the density dependent collapsed fraction of mass in halos above a critical mass at @xmath63 .",

    ", the collapsed fraction should be computed for halos of sufficient mass to initiate star formation .",
    "the critical virial temperature is set by the temperature ( @xmath97 k ) above which efficient atomic hydrogen cooling promotes star formation . following the reionization of a region , the jeans mass in the heated igm limits accretion to halos above @xmath98 k ( efstathiou  1992 ; thoul & weinberg  1996 ; dijkstra et al .",

    ". only a fraction of ionizing photons produced by stars may enter the igm .",
    "therefore an additional factor of @xmath101 ( the escape fraction ) must be included when computing the emissivity due to stars .",
    "ciardi & ferrara  ( 2005 ) include a review of existing constraints on @xmath101 which suggests that its value is @xmath102 per cent .",
    "the star formation efficiency and escape fraction may be combined into a single free parameter ( @xmath103 ) to describe the contribution of stars in our model .",
    "finally the energy density due to population - ii stars at @xmath57 may be computed using equation  ( [ fluxeq ] ) with @xmath104 given by [ stellar_energy_density ] @xmath105 this energy density may then be converted to a flux .    [ [ attenuation ] ]    having computed a luminosity density we may now compute a value for the ionizing background using equations ( [ dedv_to_flux]-[gamma ] ) , following the calculation of the optical depth ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath13 prior to overlap , and then follow the evolution of @xmath17 following overlap . in each case",

    "we compute the distribution of overdensities on a scale @xmath85 that are centered on halos of mass @xmath115 .",
    "our aim is to calculate the distribution of over densities surrounding high redshift quasars , which are expected to be larger compared to an average region of the igm ( e.g. guimaraes et al . 2007 , faucher - gigurere et al .",

    "@xmath121 is the variance of the density field smoothed with a top - hat window on a mass scale @xmath115 at redshift @xmath63 , and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are constants .",

    "thus , through integration of equations  ( [ postoverlap ] ) and ( [ preoverlap ] ) , we may compute the reionization history within typical regions surrounding luminous quasars , and compare these with the reionization history of the mean igm ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the model described in the previous section has two free parameters @xmath45 and @xmath103 . for any combination of these parameters we are able to compute a reionization history , the evolution of the mean - free - path , and the evolution of the ionizing background as a function of the local overdensity . in this section",
    "we first summarise the observations to which we compare our model before describing the results of this comparison .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we compare our model to these estimates to demonstrate that it is consistent with the available data .",
    "we now use the model developed earlier to address the level of bias in reionization near to a luminous high redshift quasar relative to the igm as a whole .",
    "we show results for a particular model in which we assume that quasars are hosted by halos of mass @xmath127 for @xmath50 .",
    "although we compare our model for the ionizing background to only three observational points at @xmath128 using two free parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath103 , we find that these parameters are not degenerate following overlap .",
    "larger values of @xmath45 increase the volume of hydrogen that must be reionized prior to overlap , leading to a delay in the reionization redshift . however , following overlap , the mean - free - path increases rapidly , and hence @xmath77 at redshifts below @xmath129 is quite insensitive to @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "varying @xmath103 strongly affects the overlap redshift , since the critical number of ionizing photons per baryon is achieved earlier . following overlap",
    ", a larger @xmath103 also increases the value of @xmath77 , which is proportional to the local emissivity in addition to the mean - free - path .",
    "we therefore adjust the parameter @xmath103 so that the model evaluated at the mean density of the universe gives a good fit to the observed ionizing background ( we find @xmath103=0.0037 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the redshift evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath135 , the volume averaged neutral fraction and the ionization rate for the best fit model .",
    "reionization histories for four different values of overdensity were computed .",
    "these overdensities were evaluated in 5 physical mpc spheres , and correspond respectively to the mean overdensity centered on a quasar at @xmath1 ( dark solid lines ) , and to the plus and minus 1-@xmath136 fluctuations around that mean ( dotted and dashed lines ) .",
    "we also show the case of the mean igm with @xmath126 ( thick grey lines ) .",
    "the examples demonstrate the level of enhancement in the reionization process within 5 physical mpc of a high redshift quasar , and the expected scatter around this enhancement .    in the top left panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the fraction of the igm yet to overlap according to the definition given in   [ models ] .",
    "the more overdense regions experience overlap first due to the enhanced production of ionizing photons in these regions . in this model",
    "the mean igm achieves overlap at @xmath137 .",
    "however within 5 physical mpc of a quasar the overlap is achieved @xmath138 redshift units earlier on average , with a 1@xmath139 scatter of @xmath140 redshift units .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with the analytic calculation of lidz et al .",
    "( 2007 ; see their figure  1 ) .",
    "however our model allows the calculation of post - overlap properties such as the volume averaged neutral fraction , ionizing photon mean - free - path and ionization rate in addition to the pre - overlap mass - averaged ionization fraction .    in the central left panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the corresponding value of the mean - free - path for ionizing photons , computed using the formalism in   [ models ] .",
    "the model predicts a rapid increase in the mean - free - path following overlap , which is also indicated from the results of numerical simulations , ( e.g. gnedin 2000 ) .",
    "however , the offset in the overlap redshift induced by large scale overdensity leads to substantial differences in mean - free - path within regions of different average overdensities for a brief period following overlap . once the rate of change of mean - free - path slows , then its dependence on overdensity is reduced .    in the central right panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the dependence of the ionization rate on redshift .",
    "the rapid change in the mean - free - path following overlap leads to a corresponding rapid change in the ionization rate .",
    "thus , for a brief period near overlap the model predicts large variations in the ionizing background within regions with different mean overdensities .",
    "note that the rapid increase in @xmath77 is entirely due to the increasing mean - free - path , and not to an increase in the source emissivity which is shown in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "indeed , the radiative feedback that accompanies the end of the reionization era results in a slight reduction of the emissivity during the time when the ionizing background undergoes a large increase . for comparison",
    "the fit to the observationally derived ionizing emissivity from bolton & haehnelt  ( 2007b ) is shown by the thick dotted line .",
    "the model emissivity is close to the observationally derived estimate ( with the offset due to the assumption of a somewhat harder spectrum here ) , and it has a similar ( small ) redshift dependence . in the upper right panel",
    "we show the volume averaged hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "again , near overlap the value of the neutral fraction inferred within the vicinity of high redshift quasars is significantly biased relative to the average igm . to better illustrate the level and duration of the bias introduced by early overlap we also plot the ionization rate at different overdensities relative to the average overdensity centered on a quasar host halo ( lower right hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we see that at times near overlap , the ionizing background within 5 physical mpc of a quasar can be as much as a factor of 3 in excess of the average ionizing background .",
    "we have also checked the enhancement of the ionizing background ( at a fixed distance ) near a quasar host following overlap for different values of the quasar host mass and @xmath45 .",
    "we find the enhancement is reduced for smaller values of the quasar host mass , but is not sensitive to the value of the critical over density @xmath45 .      in the previous section we saw that the early reionization of overdense regions will lead to an ionizing background within 5 physical mpc of a high redshift quasar that is in excess of the average igm by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "in this section , we explore the variation of this enhancement with distance from the quasar .",
    "as before , in figure  [ fig2 ] we plot the effect of overdensity on the redshift of overlap , and the subsequent ionization state of the igm .",
    "we again assume the case of @xmath50 and a quasar host mass of @xmath127 .",
    "five cases are shown , corresponding to overdensities evaluated within spheres with radii between 5 and 15 physical mpc , centered on a quasar at @xmath1 . in each case",
    "we evaluate the history assuming the mean overdensity surrounding the quasar host of mass @xmath142 .",
    "we also show the case of the mean igm with @xmath126 ( thick grey lines ) .    in the top left panel of figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the fraction of the igm that has yet to overlap .",
    "reionization will occur earlier in regions that are closer to the quasar , where the overdensity is typically higher . in the central left panel",

    "their modeling suggested that in the limit of a classical proximity zone the rapid evolution of near - zone sizes could be explained by a relatively modest evolution in the neutral fraction , with the rapid evolution being due to the approach of the background transmission reaching 10 per cent .",

    "we show the corresponding ionization rates due to the sum of the galaxies plus the central quasar .",
    "note that we have linearly added the ionization rates and thus do not account for the expected increase of the mean free - path due to the ionizing radiation of the quasar .",

    "we now turn to an analytical estimate of quasar near - zone sizes within our reionization model . adopting the near - zone size definition of fan et al .",

    "we may therefore estimate the near - zone size as the value of @xmath85 at which the sum of the galaxy and quasar ionizing rates in figure  [ fig4 ] drops below @xmath156 .",
    "note that while we are confident in our model s ability to estimate the background ionization rate , our analytic estimate of near - zone size is very approximate due to the neglect of several important effects .",
    "these effects include the attenuation of the quasars ionizing flux in the near - zone as well as the effect of discrete absorbers on the observed near - zone size ( our analytic model computes only the mean properties of a clumpy igm ) .",

    "this disagreement implies that an additional effect is responsible for the observed evolution . as suggested by bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) , and as we shall argue in more detail here using a model consistent with recent observational constraints , this additional effect is most likely due to the increasing amplitude of the ionizing background towards lower redshifts which raises the overall transmission the igm .      for comparison with our semi - analytic model",
    "we show the observed evolution of the quasar near - zones with redshift ( figure  [ fig5 ] ; thick grey line ) .",

    "both the predicted size and evolution of the quasar near - zones are similar to observations for this reionization model ( which was not tuned beyond the requirement to fit the ionization rate at @xmath187 ) .",
    "the near - zone sizes measured by fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show significant scatter , whose source we now discuss .",
    "first , while quasars are typically found in overdense regions , there are fluctuations in the overdensity of the nearby igm , and hence also fluctuations in the stage of reionization occurring at a fixed redshift around different quasars . in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig5 ]",
    "we re - plot the @xmath50 case for the average overdensity surrounding a quasar , and also plot the curves corresponding to the @xmath188 and @xmath189 density fluctuations around the mean ( dotted lines ) . our model predicts an amount of scatter in the near - zone sizes due to this cosmic variance that is significantly smaller than the scatter in observed near - zone sizes .",
    "the observed scatter is therefore due to the differing properties of the density field along different quasar lines - of - sight as has been shown previously in numerical simulations ( bolton & haehnelt  2007a ; maselli et al .",
    "2007 ; lidz et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the variation among lines - of - sight , which must be described by a full numerical treatment is manifested as scatter in the value of ionization rate that allows a transmission of 10 per cent .",
    "we may therefore estimate the scatter in the near - zone size using our analytic model by computing the dependence of near - zone size on redshift over the range of @xmath190 allowed by observation .",
    "this is shown in the lower - right panel of figure  [ fig5 ] , again for the @xmath50 case , with the mean shown by the solid line and the evolution for @xmath191 and @xmath192 shown by the dotted lines .",
    "the scatter introduced is comparable to that of the observations [ note that we do not expect additional scatter from quasar luminosity which has been scaled out in the relation of fan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , or from quasar lifetime which does not effect the size of the near zone in a highly ionized igm ( bolton & haehnelt  2007a ) ] .",
    "there may , however , be additional scatter due to variations in the temperature of the surrounding igm attributable to the temperature dependence of the recombination coefficient .    finally , it is important to note that the qualitative behaviour of the near - zone size evolution shown in figure  [ fig5 ] is independent of the details of the reionization model .",
    "the two cases shown in figure  [ fig5 ] have overlap redshifts for the mean igm at @xmath145 ( with @xmath50 ) and @xmath193 ( with @xmath51 ) .",
    "the corresponding ionization rate as a function of redshift for these models is shown in the upper left - hand panel of figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "while the evolution of the near - zone sizes can be successfully reproduced using an evolution for the ionization rate predicted by our model at the tail - end of the overlap phase , the near - zone sizes themselves can not not be used as a probe of this process .",
    "this is because the rapid evolution in the near - zone sizes is attributable to a relatively small change in the igm effective optical depth , and therefore is no more sensitive to the reionization history than the gunn - peterson trough .",
    "it is nevertheless gratifying that we can qualitatively reproduce the evolution of the near - zone sizes with our analytical model , which is calibrated with the evolution of the background ionization rate measured from the effective optical depth in typical regions of the spectra .",
    "note , however , that our analytic model is likely to overestimate the near - zone size both because it does not account for attenuation of quasar flux due to intervening neutral clumps in the igm , and because the near - zone size is computed for average absorption properties in a clumpy igm .",
    "full numerical modeling with radiative transfer is required to reliably interpret the spectra of individual high redshift quasars .",

    "firstly , we include an evolving , density dependent ionizing background using our semi - analytic model , which has been calibrated to observations at lower redshift .",
    "this addition is important because we have argued that it is the increase in the intensity of the ionizing background which leads to the rapid increase observed in the quasar near - zone sizes at @xmath194 .",
    "secondly , we construct the absorption spectra using an ionizing background computed as a function of proper time along the trajectory of a photon emitted by the quasar , rather than at the proper time of the quasar .",

    "we have consistently modeled the ionizing background due to galaxies by including the effect of reionization bias in the near - zone in detail . nevertheless , we find the enhancement of the ionization rate in the near - zone due to this effect alone is still not enough to resolve this difference in the simulations .",

    "the analytical estimates are likely to overestimate the near - zone sizes .",
    "we have therefore re - examined the assumptions which go into our numerical modeling .    in the case of a classical proximity zone the neutral hydrogen fraction and thus the sizes of the near - zones",
    "do not only depend on the ionization rate but are also rather sensitive to the temperature of the igm in the near - zone .",
    "this is due to the temperature dependence of the recombination rate for ionized hydrogen ; in ionization equilibrium the neutral hydrogen density @xmath207 . therefore , a factor of @xmath206 increase in the ionization rate is equivalent to around a factor of four increase in the ambient igm temperature . in bolton and haehnelt ( 2007a )",
    "the numerical simulations had a median igm temperature of @xmath208 before the quasar turned on , with the gas assumed to be in ionization equilibrium with the ionizing background . however , since the cooling timescale for the low density igm is typically of order a hubble time at @xmath33 , changes in the gas temperature made during a putative earlier accretion phase by the quasar would still persist .",
    "for example , if the quasar reionized the hydrogen and helium around it during an earlier phase when it had a very hard spectral index and the igm was largely neutral , radiative transfer effects can increase the temperature in the igm to @xmath209 ( abel & haehnelt  1999 ; bolton , meiksin & white  2004 ; tittley & meiksin  2006 ) . the igm will then have only cooled marginally during the interval between active quasar phases .",
    "although our radiative transfer scheme does correctly include these kind of effects , the heating boost is not present in our current simulations .",
    "this is because we assume the igm is already highly ionized by our model ionizing background before the quasar turns on , and we do not model the previous emission history of the quasar , which would require substantially more detailed simulations .",
    "therefore , to mimic this effect , we have raised the temperature in our simulations within 15 mpc of the quasar by a factor of @xmath206 , corresponding to a median value of @xmath210 .",
    "note that this temperature is smaller than the value of @xmath211 one would expect based according to the scaling relation discussed above , which is higher than can be easily achieved by photoionization .",
    "nevertheless the near - zone sizes are in good agreement with that of the observed sample .",
    "the deviation from the expected scaling is due to the reionization bias which we had not taken into account in bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) . our model for the increased ionizing background in the biased regions surrounding quasars helps to increase the near - zone sizes and drive their rapid evolution . as discussed above ,",
    "our simulations provide a good description of the observed near - zone sizes with the observed luminosities and reasonable assumptions for the quasar sed , and may thus provide a hint that the igm is substantially hotter than average around the highest redshift quasars .",
    "there remains a small discrepancy between observed and modeled near - zone sizes ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned we have not modeled the effect of the quasar radiation on the mean free path in the near - zone .",
    "there is also the possibility that the discrepancy is partially due to a continuum on the observed spectra which has been placed too low , or perhaps a quasar sed which is different to the one we have assumed . considering these uncertainties",
    "the agreement appears excellent .    in summary ,",
    "our semi - analytic modeling of the history for the ionizing background , combined with numerical simulation of the ly@xmath0 transmission in quasar near - zones , is able to quantitatively describe the evolution of quasar near - zone sizes at @xmath212 , and the evolution of the ionizing background at @xmath187 .",
    "we find that the rapid evolution observed in the sizes of the high redshift quasar near - zones is due to the increasing level of ionizing background near @xmath1 , with absolute sizes which suggest an increased igm temperature in the vicinity of the quasars .",
    "absorption spectra of high redshift quasars show an increasingly thick ly@xmath0 forest , suggesting an increase in the fraction of neutral gas in the igm approaching @xmath1 , culminating in the complete lack of detected flux in the gunn - peterson trough blueward of the ly@xmath0   line .",
    "however the meaning of the complete gunn - peterson troughs remains controversial , having been interpreted both as the completion of the reionization epoch , and as merely a gradual thickening of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the inconclusive nature of the observations has its root in the very large cross - section for absorption of ly@xmath0   photons , which allow a direct probe of the neutral hydrogen content of the igm only down to volume averaged neutral fractions of around @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that quasars reside in massive halos places them in overdense and strongly biased regions of the igm .",
    "this presents an additional challenge for the interpretation of regions in quasar absorption spectra close to the quasars intrinsic redshift , since one is using results from these biased regions to infer the properties of the mean igm . in this work",
    "we have presented a model for the evolution of the emissivity of ionizing photons and the ionization state of the igm that takes such a reionization bias in the environment of bright , high - redshift quasars into account . in our cdm based model",
    "the ionizing photons for reionization are produced by star formation in dark matter halos spanning a wide mass range . at redshifts both",
    "prior to , and post overlap , our model allows us to calculate values for the volume and mass - averaged neutral fractions , the ionizing photon mean - free - path and the evolution of the ionizing background . with appropriate choices for the parameters controlling the star formation efficiency , we are able to reproduce the ionizing emissivity at @xmath3 and the ionizing photon mean - free - path at @xmath4 inferred from the observed opacity distribution in ly@xmath0forest absorption spectra . in our model",
    "the comoving ionizing emissivity is roughly constant with redshift and the volume filling factor of ionizing regions increases slowly from 10 to 90 per cent between @xmath213 and @xmath7 , where reionization completes following the overlap of cosmological hii regions . within 5 physical mpc of a high redshift quasar , we find the evolution of the ionization state of the igm precedes that of the mean universe by around 0.3 redshift units . during the period shortly after overlap",
    "the mean - free - path is seen to increase rapidly in the model .",
    "the offset in the redshift of overlap between overdense regions and the mean igm therefore results in an ionizing background near high redshift quasars ( excluding the flux of ionizing radiation from the quasar itself ) that exceeds the value in the mean igm by a factor of @xmath8 for a short period of time .    high redshift quasar spectra also show evidence for a highly ionized region immediately surrounding the quasar . using our semi - analytic prescription for biased reionization , we model the evolution of these quasar near - zones .",
    "we find near - zone sizes which exhibit a redshift dependence which is qualitatively consistent with the current observational data .",
    "the model indicates that the rapid evolution in the near - zone sizes in the redshift range @xmath5 is due to the increasing background ionization rate originating from an almost constant galactic emissivity . within our model ,",
    "this rise in the background ionization rate is therefore due to the rapid rise in the mean free path for ionizing photons , which is expected near the tail - end of the reionization epoch as h   regions overlap .    in order to model the opacity distribution in spectra of bright high - redshift quasars in more detail",
    "we have combined our model for the evolution of the metagalactic ionization rate in the biased environment surrounding quasars with detailed line - of - sight radiative transfer simulations in the inhomogeneous high - redshift igm . in this way we were able to reproduce the sizes of the observed near - zones and their rapid evolution in the redshift range @xmath5 very well .",
    "our numerical modeling also suggests that the rapid evolution is not due directly to large changes in the neutral hydrogen fraction of the igm . instead ,",
    "as suggested by bolton & haehnelt ( 2007a ) , the near - zone sizes probe the evolution of the background ionization rate , which results in modest changes to an already very small neutral fraction .",
    "we furthermore find that the absolute sizes of the near - zones are rather sensitive to the igm temperature in the near - zones , due to the temperature dependence of the recombination rate .",
    "the observed near - zone sizes are reproduced given the observed quasar ionizing luminosities if the temperature of the surrounding igm is high ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "heating to such high temperatures at distances of up to @xmath214 proper mpc may be plausible if the hydrogen and helium in the near - zone has been highly ionized by a hard spectrum prior to the completion of reionization in the igm as a whole .",
    "this requires the continuous or intermittent emission of a hard spectrum for an extended period of time .",
    "if the igm temperature is not as hot as @xmath215 , the differences found between modeled and observed near - zone sizes could be explained as at least partially being due to a continuum on the observed spectra which has been placed too low , or perhaps a quasar sed which is different to the one we have assumed .",
    "there are still several issues to address regarding the sizes and redshift evolution of high redshift quasar near - zones .",
    "larger samples will clarify the significance of the evolution observed in the current data and hopefully constrain the evolution at even higher redshift .",
    "a more detailed modeling of the quasar accretion history and the ensuing flux of ionizing photons may be required to self - consistently model near - zone sizes .",
    "the detection of strongly broadened absorption lines within quasar near - zones would lend support to a scenario in which igm temperatures within quasar near - zones are increased by the reionization of hydrogen and helium by a hard spectrum . however , in this work we have presented a simple reionization model with a roughly constant ionizing emissivity , in which reionization ends following a rapid increase in the ionizing photon mean - free - path as h   regions overlap at @xmath7 .",
    "this scenario successfully reproduces the gross features present in high redshift quasar absorption spectra , both within and outside of the quasar near - zones .",
