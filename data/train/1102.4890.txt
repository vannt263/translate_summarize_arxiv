    "although this has been a familiar phenomenon for people in cold regions for a very long time ( terada 1947 ) , nobody has been able to explain the details until recently . a first theoretical attempt to explain ripple formation on icicles",
    "was made in ( ogawa and furukawa 2002 ) .",
    "after that a quite different ripple formation mechanism was proposed by one of the authors ( ueno 2003 , ueno 2004 , ueno 2007 ) . although the governing equations in both papers were basically identical , completely different results were obtained due to some differences in boundary conditions . the author",
    "( ueno 2003 , ueno 2007 ) predicted that ( i ) the wavelength of ripples increases with a decrease in the angle of the inclined plane , ( ii ) the wavelength increases only gradually with an increase in the water supply rate per width , and ( iii ) the ripples move upward at about half speed of the mean growth rate of icicle radius .",
    "the experimental results by matsuda were obtained at a fixed water supply rate .",
    "we conducted similar experiments for various inclination angles and water supply rates .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to numerically investigate the validity of the assumptions used in both models ( ogawa and furukawa 2002 ) and ( ueno 2003 ) , and to compare the above theoretical predictions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) with our own experimental results .",
    "we consider an ice growth on a substrate by supplying water from the top , as shown in ( b ) .",
    "one side of the water film is a water - air surface and the other side is growing ice . as a result of the instability of the ice - water interface as shown in ( c )",
    ", the flow in the water film can be changed depending on the morphology of ice . in previous papers ( ueno 2003 , ueno 2004 , ueno 2007 ) , we assumed a semi - infinite ice layer and no airflow ahead of the water - air surface . in this paper , we extend the previous theoretical framework to include heat conduction from the ice - water interface into the substrate thorough the ice with finite thickness .",
    "not only does this theoretical framework enable us to rewrite the governing equations and boundary conditions in a more tractable form to solve numerically , but it also let us easily compare the difference between the models ( ogawa and furukawa 2002 ) and ( ueno 2003 )",
    ".    instead of dealing with the complete geometry of the icicle , round stick and gutter on an inclined plane , the theoretical analysis is assumed to be restricted to two - dimensional vertical cross - sections of their objects , as shown in figures [ fig : inclinedplane ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "we will also explain why the non - uniformity in the temperature distribution at the ice - water interface does not disappear , resulting in the temperature deviation @xmath28 from @xmath5 . a local temperature deviation of @xmath29 from @xmath6 at a disturbed water - air surface dissipates quickly by thermal diffusion in the air because shear stress is zero at the water - air surface .",

    "although all ripples move upward , their speeds are not uniform because some ripples sometimes do not move when some portion of the ice surface is not covered with water .",

    "the ripples produced initially almost disappeared over a 20-hour period due to sublimation . in this experiment , an upward movement of ripple was observed .",
    "this result is consistent with the observation that many tiny air bubbles are trapped in the upstream region of any protruded part of an icicle , and line up in the upward direction during icicle growth ( maeno 1994 , ueno 2007 ) .    in the absence of heat conduction into the substrate through the ice , from the second equation in ( [ eq : bco(0)-sl - t ] ) , we can estimate the degree of supercooling of the water film at @xmath447 @xmath0c by using the measured value of @xmath436 mm / h and the typical value of @xmath448 @xmath22 m .",

    "there was an apparent discrepancy for the amplification rate between the analytical result in ( ogawa and furukawa 2002 ) and our numerical result , in spite of solving the same governing equations with the same boundary conditions as those used in the model ( ogawa and furukawa 2002 ) .",
    "the characteristic length scale of ripples could not be determined under their boundary conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the author s analytical results ( ueno 2003 , ueno 2007 ) were in good agreement with our numerical results , and the theoretical predictions were confirmed in our own experiments : ( i ) the wavelength of ripples increases with a decrease in the angle of the inclined plane , ( ii ) the wavelength increases only gradually with an increase in the water supply rate per width , and ( iii ) the ripples move upward .",
    "we also extended the theoretical framework ( ueno 2003 ) to include heat conduction into the substrate through the ice .",
    "if we take this into account , the wavelength depends on the ratio of the unperturbed temperature gradient in ice to that in water , @xmath38 , which includes the parameters such as ice thickness , thermal boundary layer thickness in the air , as well as substrate and ambient air temperature .",
    "all wavelengths of ripples on icicles observed in nature as well as those produced experimentally on a wooden plane and stick have a centimeter - scale .",
    "the thermal conductivities of these materials are small , and so the heat conduction into the substrate can be neglected .",
    "hence , we can say that the kind of universality of centimeter - scale ripples produced on an ice surface is due to @xmath291 . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath449 ,",
    "our stability analysis predicts a critical value of @xmath38 , below which the wavelength depends on the parameter @xmath38 , but above which ripples do not appear .",
    "our stability analysis would be applicable to prevent ripple formation on ice surfaces grown on a substrate for a given @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "there is an analogy between wet growth and icicle growth ( makkonen and lozowski 2008 ) . in the case of wet growth ,",
    "water is collected from the impingement of supercooled water droplets . whereas , in the case of icicle growth , water is supplied from melting snow and ice at the root of the icicle . in both cases ,",
    "the surface of ice is covered with a supercooled water film , and ice grows from the portion of water film , by releasing latent heat into the ambient air below 0 @xmath0c . from the point of view of engineering applications ,",
    "the above analogy leads us to consider growth and morphology of ice on aircraft wings , wind turbine blades and aerial cables under wet icing condition , based on our theoretical framework .",
    "to do so , the present framework should be extended to include air flow , a supercooled water film motion driven by gravitational and aerodynamic forces , surface tension , and heat conduction through the ice into the object of cylindrical or arbitrary shape ( myers 2002a , myers 2002b , myers and charpin 2004 , fu 2006 ) . in our model ,",
    "the flow of water film is driven by gravity only , and both surface tension and gravity act on the water - air surface of the water film flowing down an inclined plane .",
    "the present basic velocity profile @xmath450 in the water film was derived from the free stress condition at the water - air surface .",
    "if an aerodynamic force also acts on the water - air surface , the basic profile of @xmath450 would change from the half - parabolic form .",
