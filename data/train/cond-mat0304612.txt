    "@xcite and @xcite agrees very well with the results of direct large - scale simulations .",
    "it has been realized long ago that , alongside with the change in the behavior of the eigenfunctions , a localization - delocalization transition manifests itself in the statistics of the energy levels . in particular , as the energy is swept across the mobility edge , the shape of the els crosses over from the wigner - dyson distribution , corresponding to the appropriate universality class , to the poisson distribution .",
    "moreover , finite - size corrections to the critical els close to the mobility edge allow to determine the value of the correlation length exponent @xcite , thus avoiding an actual analysis of the spatial extent of the wave functions .",

    "energy levels are defined only in a closed system which requires to apply appropriate boundary conditions .",

    "this approach makes is perfectly suited for large - size numerical simulations , e.g. studying @xmath50 sp networks .    in order to combine the above algorithm with the rg iteration , in which a rather small unit of sp s is considered , we first `` close '' the rg unit at each rg step in order to discretize the energy levels as shown in fig .",

    "<S> in contrast to a usual metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , the qh transition is characterized by a single extended state located exactly at the center @xmath4 of each landau band @xcite . when approaching @xmath4 , the localization length @xmath5 of the electron wavefunction diverges according to a power law @xmath6 , where @xmath7 defines the distance to the mit for a suitable control parameter , e.g. , the electron energy . on the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath8 has been extracted from various numerical simulations , e.g. , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite . in experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 has been obtained , e.g. , from the frequency @xcite or the sample size @xcite dependence of the critical behavior of the resistance in the transition region at strong magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a semianalytical description of the integer qh transition , based on the extension of the scaling ideas for the classical percolation @xcite to the chalker - coddington ( cc ) model of the quantum percolation @xcite , has been developed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of this description , a real - space - renormalization group ( rg ) approach , is the following . </S>",
    "<S> each rg step corresponds to a doubling of the system size . </S>",
    "<S> the rg transformation relates the conductance _ </S>",
    "<S> distribution _ of the sample at the next step to the conductance distribution at the previous step . </S>",

    "<S> macroscopic _ sample at the qh transition . </S>",
    "<S> this _ universal _ </S>",
    "<S> distribution describes the mesoscopic properties of a fully coherent qh sample . </S>",
    "<S> analogously to the classical percolation @xcite , the correlation length exponent , @xmath8 , was extracted from the rg procedure @xcite using the fact that a slight shift of the initial distribution with respect to the fp distribution @xmath0 drives the system to the insulator upon renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> then the rate of the shift of the distribution maximum determines the value of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , both @xmath14 and the critical exponent obtained within the rg approach @xcite agree very well with the `` exact '' results of the large - scale simulations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present paper is threefold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we briefly review the basic ingredients that constitute the real - space rg method in the qh situation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we extend the rg approach to include the level statistics at the qh transition and apply a method analogous to the finite - size - corrections analysis to extract @xmath8 from the energy - level statistics ( els ) obtained within the rg approach . </S>",
    "<S> this method yields @xmath15 , which is even closer to the most precise large - scale simulations result @xmath16 @xcite than the value @xmath17 inferred from the conductance distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this agreement is by no means trivial . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the original rg transformation @xcite related the conductances , i.e. , the _ absolute values _ of the transmission coefficients of the original and the doubled samples , while the _ phases _ of the transmission coefficients were assumed random and uncorrelated . in contrast , the level statistics at the transition corresponds to the fp in the distribution of these phases . therefore , the success of the rg approach for conductances does not guarantee that it will be equally accurate _ </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively _ for the level statistics . </S>",
    "<S> third , we show that the rg structure employed in the present approach , which is constructed from @xmath18 saddle points ( sp ) , represents in many aspects the minimal model of the qh transition . a further reduction in the number of sp leads to less reliable results . </S>"
