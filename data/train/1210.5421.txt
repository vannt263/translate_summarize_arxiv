    "convection in the geophysical context is often associated with compressible effects ( as early as in the work of @xcite ) and simultaneously with a significant energy dissipation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of the same order of magnitude as the heat flux . in the case of convection in the earth s mantle",
    ", it is important to determine the distribution of dissipation as it is strongly coupled with effective viscosity and plays a role in the structure of convection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the amount of dissipation in the liquid earth s core is a direct measure of the energy available to the geodynamo ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this paper we shall be interested specifically in dissipation in liquids , defined as those fluids with a small product @xmath4 compared to unity , where @xmath5 is the coefficient of thermal expansion at constant pressure and @xmath6 is the thermodynamic temperature .",
    "this product is unity for perfect and semi - perfect gases , but is usually very small for liquids , of order @xmath7 both in the outer core of the earth , and in the mantle which are hence both usually considered as liquids from the perspective of convection .",
    "let us consider a simple configuration of a region of newtonian fluid with no internal heat production , bounded with solid walls or stress - free boundaries and prescribed temperatures or heat fluxes within a uniform , constant gravity field @xmath8 .",
    "it might be a simple rayleigh - bnard configuration with an imposed temperature difference .",
    "it might also be more complex , we simply require that the boundary exerts no work on the fluid region and that a statistically steady state can be reached so that the net heat input is zero .",
    "density @xmath9 , velocity @xmath10 , pressure @xmath11 , temperature @xmath6 and entropy @xmath12 satisfy the continuity , navier - stokes and entropy ( or heat transfer ) equations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the conduction heat flux ( with thermal conductivity @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the stress tensor and @xmath17 is the tensor of the rate of deformation . rewriting ( [ entropy ] ) using the thermodynamic relation @xmath18 ( well - known equation ( [ ds ] ) re - derived in the appendix ) , with @xmath0 the specific heat capacity at constant pressure , leads to @xmath19 a classical expression for the energy dissipation is obtained by integration of equation ( [ heat ] ) over the whole fluid domain , under the tentative assumption that @xmath0 can be taken as uniform , and by taking its time - average ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes time - averaged volume integral . however , the integration of the dot product of the navier - stokes equation ( [ ns ] ) with velocity @xmath10 , assuming no work is done through the boundary , leads to @xmath22 which is very different from equation ( [ hewitt85 ] ) for liquids as @xmath23 .",
    "the inconsistency is resolved when it is recognized that @xmath0 can neither be uniform nor a function of temperature only . as @xmath24 by definition , with @xmath25",
    "the enthalpy , the term @xmath26 in equation ( [ heat ] ) can be integrated as follows @xmath27 the first term of the right - hand side is always zero ( this would be true for any function of state , not just for @xmath25 ) in the statistically steady case . the second term is expressed using equation ( [ dhdp ] ) of the appendix , so that @xmath28 by making the hypothesis of a uniform @xmath0 , an important term has been forgotten , thus invalidating expression ( [ hewitt85 ] ) .",
    "the correct averaging of the heat equation , just like the balance of mechanical energy , leads to ( [ correct_dissip ] ) .",
    "what we have done is to show that it does not make sense to assume @xmath0 constant when @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ dhdp ] ) imposes that @xmath25 depends on pressure , that dependence can not be made as weak as one wishes and has consequences on the term of the dissipation budget involving @xmath0 treated in equation ( [ integ ] ) .",
    "incidently , we may just write two other exact expressions for dissipation , at least as fundamental as ( [ correct_dissip ] ) , obtained from the integration of ( [ heat ] ) where entropy variations are not expanded in terms of pressure and temperature variations ( see @xcite , page 82 ) : @xmath30",
    "equation ( [ correct_dissip ] ) will now be used , within the anelastic approximation ( aa ) ( see * ? ? ? * ) , to determine a condition when the anelastic liquid approximation ( ala ) ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) can be made .",
    "we assume that convection is sufficiently vigorous to drive the fluid close to an iso - entropy state , commonly called adiabatic. all quantities will be expanded around their depth - dependent adiabatic reference state denoted with the subscript @xmath31 while fluctuations are indicated by primes .",
    "the reference state is dependent on height only and is defined such that the entropy @xmath32 is uniform and that the hydrostatic equation is satisfied @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the vertical upward coordinate .",
    "equation ( [ ds ] ) shows that , when entropy is vigorously mixed , a relation develops between pressure and temperature variations .",
    "in addition , when hydrostatics is considered , this leads to the so - called adiabatic gradient @xmath35 the main purpose of the anelastic approximation is to eliminate sound - waves by replacing the general continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) , by its zeroth - order expansion @xmath36 the first order expansion of the entropy equation ( [ entropy ] ) is @xmath37 writing the first term in a conservative form introduces an advection term for the adiabatic temperature profile which is expressed using the adiabatic gradient ( first term on the right - hand side of the following equation ) @xmath38 the derivation of the anelastic momentum equation is then based on the expansion of density fluctuations in terms of entropy and pressure fluctuations @xmath39 using the maxwell relation associated with ( [ gibbsh ] ) and the expression for the adiabatic temperature gradient obtained from ( [ ds ] ) for the first term , and hydrostatics for the second , one obtains @xmath40 substituting in the navier - stokes equation ( [ ns ] ) and selecting the lowest order terms leads to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the vertical unit vector .",
    "the first and third terms on the right - hand side can be put together in a single conservative term @xmath43 this form of the dynamic equation was derived by @xcite . from this point",
    ", we can derive important consequences in terms of energy dissipation . in ( [ ns_lin_bis ] ) the work of @xmath44 integrated over",
    "the volume is zero .",
    "therefore the mechanical works of the first ( @xmath45 ) and third ( @xmath46 ) terms of ( [ ns_lin ] ) are opposite to each other . as the expression of the dissipation @xmath47 becomes @xmath48",
    ", we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the incompressibility at constant entropy . introducing @xmath51 ,",
    "the celerity of sound waves , one can finally express the energy dissipation in terms of the correlation of velocity and pressure fluctuations @xmath52 however , energy dissipation must also be equal to the work done by the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ ns_lin ] ) , in agreement with the expression of dissipation associated with ( [ entropy_lin ] ) and the general expression ( [ two_more ] ) , @xmath53 now in terms of the correlation between velocity and entropy fluctuations .",
    "expanding entropy fluctuations in terms of temperature and pressure fluctuations , using ( [ ds ] ) , leads to @xmath54",
    "comparing equations ( [ otherdissbis ] ) and ( [ otherdisstp ] ) shows the relative importance of the pressure and the temperature terms in ( [ otherdisstp ] ) .",
    "the coefficient within the pressure / velocity correlation term can be written @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the ratio of specific heat capacities at constant pressure and at constant volume . the second equality in ( [ boundp ] )",
    "can be retrieved from the general mayer relation @xmath57 . in the case of a constant value of @xmath58 , independent of temperature and pressure",
    "( one must here verify that there exist equations of state with constant ratio of specific heat coefficients : this is indeed the case for the class of ideal gases , with arbitrary polytropic index ) , equations ( [ boundp ] ) and ( [ otherdissbis ] ) lead immediately to the fraction of pressure / velocity correlations to dissipation in ( [ otherdisstp ] ) @xmath59 it is hence safe from the point of view of energy dissipation to express entropy fluctuations @xmath60 ( see [ otherdisster ] ) in terms of temperature fluctuations only @xmath61 ( see [ boundp2 ] ) in equation ( [ ns_lin_bis ] ) under the condition @xmath62 while that condition was obtained rigorously only in the case of constant @xmath58 , we expect it to apply in the general case .",
    "furthermore , provided there are reasonable correlations between @xmath63 and @xmath64 as well as between @xmath63 and @xmath61 , one can expect the condition ( [ conditionliquid ] ) to be the correct condition of application of the anelastic liquid approximation .",
    "it then follows that , while entropy fluctuations are replaced by temperature fluctuations in ( [ ns_lin_bis ] ) , @xmath65 must be substituted to @xmath66 in ( [ entropy_lin ] ) to ensure a consistent energy balance .",
    "this leads to the following anelastic liquid approximation equations , derived from the anelastic approximation ( [ continuity0 ] ) , ( [ entropy_lin ] ) and ( [ ns_lin_bis ] ) : @xmath67 let us mention here , for completeness , that a so - called truncated anelastic liquid approximation ( tala ) has been used ( for instance in @xcite and @xcite ) in which the contribution of pressure fluctuations to density fluctuations are also neglected in equation ( [ expan_rho_bis ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the term @xmath68 in equation ( [ ns_ala ] ) above is changed for @xmath69 . however , as pointed out in @xcite , this change introduces an imbalance between energy dissipation calculated from the dynamical equation and heat dissipation in the thermal equation .",
    "such a tala formulation should be avoided when the calculation of energy dissipation is an issue .",
    "our condition ( [ conditionliquid ] ) is in contrast to a scaling law usually derived ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the anelastic liquid approximation momentum equation ( [ ns_ala ] ) expressing the typical magnitude of pressure fluctuations as a function of temperature fluctuations , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the typical length - scale of the fluid domain .",
    "this leads to the following relation @xmath72 , \\label{estimp2}\\ ] ] which would imply that the anelastic liquid approximation is valid when @xmath73 , where the dissipation number is @xmath74 .",
    "this heuristic scaling law ( [ estimp2 ] ) involving @xmath75 , hence @xmath71 and @xmath76 , is not compatible with the exact relation ( [ boundp2 ] ) from which the condition ( [ conditionliquid ] ) was obtained solely in terms of fluid properties .",
    "actually , from equations ( [ otherdissbis ] ) and ( [ otherdisstp ] ) , one can infer a more adequate scaling of the pressure fluctuations than @xmath70 , which is valid in the general anelastic approximation ( liquid or not ) @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the incompressibility at constant temperature .",
    "let us now discuss the implications of the results derived in this paper . concerning the exact model ( [ continuity ] ) , ( [ ns ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) ,",
    "we have shown that it is crucial to use thermodynamically consistent thermo - physical coefficients . specifically , considering a fluid with constant heat capacity @xmath0 and",
    "small product @xmath4 of temperature by thermal expansion coefficient leads to a severe inconsistency when determining the energetic dissipation .",
    "whatever @xmath4 , dissipation is always equal to @xmath79 .",
    "once compressibility effects have been taken into account in an anelastic model , no energetic inconsistency can arise even in the case when constant uniform values for @xmath80 and other coefficients are used in equations ( [ entropy_lin ] ) and ( [ ns_lin_bis ] ) .",
    "using the correct expression for dissipation , within the model of the anelastic approximation , we have then been able to obtain the condition @xmath81 for the anelastic liquid approximation to be valid .",
    "that condition is only dependent on materials properties , not on gravity or length - scale .",
    "note that the condition ( [ conditionliquid ] ) can be expressed with the grneisen parameter , @xmath82 used in solid state physics , as @xmath83 .",
    "the grneisen parameter is close to unity in the mantle and in the earth s",
    "core and so is the ratio of heat capacities .",
    "this is the reason why the condition ( [ conditionliquid ] ) is close to @xmath29 in practice concerning the dynamics of the deep earth . for the earth",
    "s liquid outer core and for the mantle , the dimensionless number in ( [ conditionliquid ] ) is of order 0.05 justifying the anelastic liquid approximation .    from the correct expression for dissipation ( [ correct_dissip ] ) , we have obtained equations ( [ entropy_ala ] ) and ( [ ns_ala ] ) , in the anelastic liquid approximation , which both lead to the following expression for dissipation @xmath84 surprisingly , @xcite reach the same conclusion when starting from their expression ( [ hewitt85 ] ) : @xmath85 this expression is indeed approximately correct for liquids and the apparently very different expressions ( [ correct_dissip ] ) and ( [ hewitt85 ] ) are nearly equal in the anelastic liquid approximation @xmath86 .",
    "this is due to the large cancellations in ( [ correct_dissip ] ) which allow the same result to be reached when multiplied by a small term @xmath4 , with appropriate fluctuations ( here @xmath87 to the leading order ) .",
    "we only expect significantly different values from expressions ( [ correct_dissip ] ) and ( [ hewitt85 ] ) when @xmath4 is neither too small nor too close to unity , where ( [ correct_dissip ] ) and ( [ hewitt85 ] ) become similar .    to conclude , we hope that we have contributed to a clarification of the expression of dissipation in a convective system and of the anelastic liquid approximation .",
    "we have not systematically investigated the consequences of these findings in the different possible fields of application : dynamics of the earth s core and mantle , dynamics of giant planets , ice planets , super - earth exoplanets . regarding the application of the anelastic liquid approximation for the terrestrial planets obeying a generic murnaghan equation of state ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have no indication that the new criterion ( [ conditionliquid ] ) , @xmath81 , differs significantly from the classical criterion @xmath88 . according to murnaghan s equation of state , the coefficient of expansion @xmath5 decreases strongly when",
    "density @xmath9 is increased , @xmath89 while the coefficient of incompressiblity increases with @xmath90 , @xmath91 , with a value of @xmath92 around 3 .",
    "we have considered the case of silicate planets from one up to possibly ten earth masses .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 is always less than 0.08 , and that value decreases very quickly away from the surface to much lower values in the bulk of the mantle ( decreasing also when planetary mass increases ) .",
    "provided the general anelastic approximation can be applied to mantle dynamics , the anelastic liquid approximation is indeed well justified for the mantle dynamics of the earth and even better justified for super - earths .",
    "from the gibbs equation expressed in terms of the gibbs free energy @xmath94 @xmath95 the following maxwell relation is derived , expressing the partial derivative of entropy with respect to pressure at constant temperature @xmath96 the partial derivative of entropy with respect to temperature at constant pressure is obtained as follows .",
    "two expression for @xmath97 are first written , one from gibbs relation , the other from the definition of @xmath0 @xmath98 the difference of these expressions above leads to @xmath99 this shows that the partial derivative of entropy with respect to temperature at constant pressure is @xmath100 .",
    "along with equation ( [ dsdp ] ) , this leads to @xmath101 comparing equations ( [ tds ] ) and ( [ ds ] ) leads to an important expression used in this paper @xmath102 the partial derivative of this last equation with respect to temperature at constant pressure leads to expressions of the derivative of @xmath0 with respect to pressure at constant temperature @xmath103 . \\label{dcpdpbis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
