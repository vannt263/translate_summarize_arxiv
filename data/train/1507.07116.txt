    "recently discovered topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted a lot of interest in condensed matter physics.@xcite this novel electronic phase in solids has a band gap in the bulk but it can conduct an electric current via gapless edge states which are robust against scattering on impurities or other weak perturbations of ideal systems.@xcite formation of the metallic edge states is related to the nontrivial topology of the ground state which originates from a spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the tis are characterized by topological invariants which can not be continuously changed unless the single - particle gap is closed.@xcite the idea of the tis has been extended into symmetry protected topological phases which possess nontrivial topological properties as long as the symmetries are present.@xcite the existence of the topological gapless edge states was experimentally confirmed by transport measurements@xcite and an angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy@xcite in many materials , such as , e.g. , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , or @xmath2 quantum wells .",

    "namely , interaction can lead to the creation of an ordered phase which through renormalization of the band parameters may compete with the topological state.@xcite moreover , local correlations related to the frequency dependent part of the self - energy can drive a topological phase transition.@xcite these issues have been stimulated by research on iridium - based materials @xmath3 ( x = na or li ) in which both spin - orbit coupling and electron correlations are strong.@xcite another new class of systems in which strong interactions could play important role are cold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite recent experimental progress in this field allows to test hamiltonians with different types of hoppings on lattices , synthetic spin - orbit couplings and synthetic gauge fields , as well as the interactions , in terms of their topological properties.@xcite    despite of intensive research , the influence of the strong correlations on the tis at finite temperatures appeared so far only in few studies.@xcite a major problem was how to extend a idea of the topological insulators to nonzero temperatures .",

    "another advantage of the def .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) is that due to the bulk - boundary correspondence the spectral constrain @xmath30 links our topological invariants to the physical observable , which is the number of edge states .",
    "finally we note that at nonzero temperatures , the hall conductivity is not quantized due to a thermal activation of states from a conduction band .",
    "therefore , the topological invariants can not be measured directly as response functions . however , at sufficiently low temperatures the contribution from the edge states should dominate . on the other hand ,",
    "the edge states are experimentally accessible by angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy even at the room temperature.@xcite",
    "as discussed in the sec .  [ sec : s1 ] , topological invariants for noninteracting systems at finite and zero temperature are the same , when parameters of the model are not temperature depended .",

    "the hamiltonian is invariant with respect to : the lattice inversion , the spin rotation , the time reversal symmetry , and the particle - hole transformation . due to particle - hole symmetry",
    "the system does not possess an indirect band gap for any parameters .",
    "the localized particles in the fk model are thermodynamically coupled to the itinerant electrons and their spatial distributions is determined by a minimum of the thermodynamic potential of the system . on a bipartite lattice at half - filling the solution of the kane - mele falicov - kimball ( kmfk ) model eq.([eqn : e1 ] ) with @xmath68 possesses a long - range order at low temperatures,@xcite in which the localized fermions form a checkerboard pattern and the itinerant electrons form a charge density wave ( cdw )  . then the inversion symmetry of the ground state is broken .",

    "in the strong interaction limit the kmfk model is mapped onto the antiferromagnetic ising model , where @xmath139 is a spin variable at a site @xmath58 and an exchange coupling constants are @xmath140 for the nearest - neighbors and @xmath141 for the next - nearest - neighbors hopping , respectively.@xcite on the honeycomb lattice the ground state is a simple antiferromagnet for @xmath142 and a super - antiferromagnet otherwise.@xcite such spin configurations correspond to the checkerboard and stripes pattern of the localized particles , respectively .",
    "hence , we obtain the threshold ratio @xmath143 of the cdw phase stability for arbitrary u. when it is not satisfied the cdw phase can still exist but only in a finite range of u.",
    "the topological invariant of the kmfk model ( [ eqn : e1 ] ) is equivalent to the chern number for the spin up copy of the haldane model.@xcite chern number is defined by@xcite @xmath144 where the surface integral is over the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and @xmath145 is a berry curvature . the vector potential @xmath146 is called a berry connection and @xmath147 are eigenvectors of the lower block band of the hamiltonian matrix ( [ eqn : e5 ] ) . from stokes",
    "theorem we see that chern number is nonzero when one global gauge of vector potential the @xmath148 does not exist . therefore , this observation yields the practical test of the existence of a nontrivial topology .    in the kmfk model ,",
    "the topological hamiltonian matrix is given by two dimensional matrix which can be written in the form @xmath149 where the pauli matrices are marked by @xmath150 with @xmath151 and the decomposition coefficients @xmath152 are functions of the momentum .",
    "the spin index @xmath84 is omitted .",
    "for the two dimensional hamiltonian matrix the eigenvector of the lower band , i.e. the eigenvalue for a given @xmath86 , is @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is a normalization constant .",
    "this wave function is singular when @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "we can gauge out the singularity by performing a gauge transformation @xmath158 obtaining the eigenvector @xmath159 it is now singular when @xmath156 and @xmath160 .",
    "the vector @xmath161 sets a map from the bz into the two dimensional unit sphere .",

    "( [ eqn : e1 ] ) , the total chern number is sum of chern numbers for both copies of the haldane model @xmath172 .",

    "it is called the spin chern number @xcite and given by the formula @xmath174 .",
