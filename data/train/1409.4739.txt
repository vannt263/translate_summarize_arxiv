    "the immense increase of user - traffic is driving the need for more dense cellular networks and suitable analytic evaluation methods .",
    "the irregular positioning of base stations deployed in dense urban areas implies that they are best assumed to be random , which has motivated stochastic geometry models .",
    "base station positions often can be well fitted with homogeneous poisson point processes ( cf  @xcite ) , which enables or considerably simplifies analytic evaluation methods .",
    "`` worst - case '' arguments are also used to justify the use of poisson models . in this paper",
    "we revisit an alternative argument , already considered in  @xcite , based on the presence of a shadowing fitted with the log - normal distribution of sufficiently large variance .",
    "more specifically , we revisit the convergence result that a broad range of _ empirically homogeneous _ network configurations ( for example , deterministic lattices or arbitrary random stationary point patterns ) give results appearing to the typical user as though the placement of base stations is a poisson process when sufficiently large log - normal shadowing is incorporated into models with power - law path - loss functions .",
    "the rigorous statement involves the values of the propagation loss of a single user with respect to all base stations , called here the propagation process .",
    "when the variance of the log - normal shadowing , assumed independent across different base stations , tends to infinity , these values ( considered as a point process on the positive half - line ) , appropriately rescaled , converge to an inhomogeneous poisson point process with a power - law density characterized ( up to a multiplicative constant ) by the path - loss exponent .",
    "this is exactly how a poisson network `` appears '' to its typical user .    in this paper",
    "we present also two extensions of the above convergence result .",
    "firstly , we consider some arbitrary characteristics , for example , the type of the station in a @xmath0-tier network as in  @xcite , which may depend on the shadowing .",
    "we characterize the distribution of these characteristics in the asymptotic regime .",
    "we study also the geographic distances to the bases stations ( from the given user measuring the propagation loss values ) and find that the conditional distances to the base stations given their propagation loss values asymptotically become independent and log - normally distributed .",
    "this is also how a poisson network with log - normal shadowing `` appears '' to its typical user .",
    "however , in the limiting regime ( unlike in the poisson network ) these distances are identically distributed , which means that the value of the measured propagation loss ( small or large ) does not carry any information about the distance of the corresponding station .",
    "this can be seen as some kind of decoupling between the real and model geometry and sheds more light on the limitations of the applicability of the poisson model whenever its only justification is a strong shadowing . in this latter case ,",
    "the network characteristics entirely based on the values of the propagation losses can be reliably approximated by the corresponding functionals of the poisson process , which does not however represent the euclidean geometry of the network .",
    "the above convergence results also apply to composite fading - shadowing models when they consist of a product of two ( or more ) independent random variables with one being log - normal .",
    "examples of such models include suzuki ( or rayleigh - log - normal )  @xcite shadowing , a generalization of it  @xcite , and nakagami - log - normal shadowing . for more details on these models and a comparison of their statistical estimators , see reig and rubio  @xcite .",
    "the presentation of the convergence results is preceded with new results regarding the invariance of the marked poisson network model , which help to understand the asymptotic scaling of the general marked model .",
    "asymptotic results are useful in practice whenever the convergence is fast enough for the limiting object to be a reasonable approximation of the actual ( pre - limit ) situation .",
    "a precise analysis of the speed of this convergence is beyond the scope of this paper , and would arguably require a different proof technique .",
    "however , revisiting  @xcite , we address this issue by comparing the empirical distribution function of the path - loss to the strongest base station and of the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) simulated in perfectly hexagonal network and measured in urban areas of real operational networks to the corresponding analytic results available for poisson model .",
    "we show that the poisson model can fit both the statistics of the perfect hexagonal and the `` real '' network .",
    "to make this claim more quantitative , we use the kolmogorov - smirnov tests on the statistics of the hexagonal network and show that it can not be significantly distinguished by a single user ( measuring the propagation loss to the serving base station ) from a poisson network in the presence of the log - normal shadowing of the logarithmic standard deviation of about 10db .",
    "this is a realistic assumption for outdoor and indoor wireless communications in many urban scenarios .",
    "having justified the poisson approximation in a `` real '' network scenario , we use this limiting model to build a new statistical method for estimating the exponent of the path - loss function based on propagation loss data collected by users with respect to their serving base stations .",
    "this new method complements existing methods .",
    "we illustrate the proposed method on both simulation and real - world data from a network operator in europe .    _",
    "the remaining part of the paper _ is organized as follows . in section  [ s.related-work ]",
    "some related works are briefly discussed . in section  [ s.poisson ]",
    "we recall the poisson network model with its useful results , some of which are extended .",
    "our main poisson convergence results are presented in section  [ s.convergence ] .",
    "their proofs are deferred to the . in section  [ s.regression ]",
    "we numerically verify the quality of the asymptotic poisson approximation and present a new linear - regression method for the estimation of path - loss exponents .",
    "the main convergence result proved in this paper can be rephrased as follows : in the presence of the log - normal shadowing of sufficiently high variance , the statistics of the propagation loss of a single user with respect to different base stations are essentially invariant with respect to the exact geographic positioning of the base stations , whether regular or not , for a wide class of empirically homogeneous networks . even in perfectly hexagonal case",
    "they appear as though they were realized in a poisson network model .",
    "brown  @xcite first observed this by simulation , later confirmed independently by baszczyszyn and karray  @xcite who suggested using classical convergence results of random translations of point processes ; see daley and vere - jones  ( * ? ? ? * section 11.4 ) .",
    "this approach was first adapted and applied in this setting by baszczyszyn , karray and keeler  @xcite , which forms part of the results presented here .",
    "the fact that an arbitrary network can be approximated ( from the point of view of a single user ) by a poisson model is very useful .",
    "this latter model has already been extensively studied .",
    "in particular , it enjoys the following very useful property , here referred to as _ propagation invariance _ , which stems from using a power - law as the path - loss function : the statistics of the propagation loss of a single user with respect to different base stations ( which we called the propagation process  ) depend on the fading distribution through only one moment .",
    "this property , provides considerable tractability and has led to the concept of so - called _ equivalent networks _ from the perspective of the typical user ; cf  @xcite , where extensions to heterogeneous networks are also presented .",
    "this convenient property has been observed independently in physics models  @xcite and network models  @xcite ; see  @xcite and references therein for further details . for example , compare  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 10 ) and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2 ) , which effectively both give the same equivalence result for , in our setting , the marked propagation process of the typical user . in the physics context",
    ", these invariance results imply bolthausen - sznitman invariance property ( cf  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 2.26 ) ) ) for the poisson - dirichlet process , which is used to study the sherrington - kirkpatrick model for spin glasses ( types of disordered magnets ) .",
    "this latter process   is exactly the so - called _ signal - to - total - interference ratio _",
    "( stir ) process , which in turn is trivially related to the sir process in ( interference - limited ) poisson networks  @xcite .",
    "recently several characteristics related to the propagation process in the poisson model have been studied .",
    "for example , closed and semi - closed expressions for the coverage probability in so - called multi - tier network models  @xcite , with the concept of @xmath1-coverage being later introduced  @xcite .",
    "more recently , these models have been advanced by studying the coverage probability under signal coordination  @xcite and interference cancellation schemes  @xcite , with a recent contribution being the joint probability density of the order statistics of the process formed from the sinr values of the typical user  @xcite .",
    "the recently observed relation between the sinr values and a type of poisson - dirichlet process ( cf  @xcite ) can potentially bring some further progress to this subject .",
    "finally , as we have already explained , the asymptotic poisson model does not represent well the `` real '' geometric locations of base stations .",
    "several papers propose and study `` more realistic '' geometric models of the network based on , for example , determinantal point processes  @xcite , of which the poisson process is a special case .",
    "the goal of this section is to present the poisson network model which will be proved in the next section to be a limit of an arbitrary , stationary network model subject to strong log - normal shadowing .",
    "on @xmath2 , we model the base stations with a homogeneous poisson point process @xmath3 with density @xmath4 .",
    "we take the `` typical user '' model approach where one assumes a typical user is located at the origin and consider what he perceives or experiences in the network .",
    "given @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be independent and identically distributed ( iid ) positive random variables that represent the propagation effects ( shadowing and/or fading ) experienced by the typical user with respect to the respective stations .",

    "it is somewhat more convenient and natural to consider the propagation - loss process @xmath14 , which does not have infinitely many small values .",
    "this approach is compliant with the existing engineering literature on this subject .",

    "[ l.invariance ] assume that @xmath15 then the propagation process @xmath14 is an inhomogeneous poisson point process with intensity measure @xmath16 , where the propagation constant is @xmath17    this is a well - known result .",

    "this invariance with respect to the distribution of the propagation effects @xmath21 can be rephrased by saying that the poisson network model is a fixed point of a network transformation which consists of perturbing path - losses from all base stations to the typical user by some random ( iid ) propagation effects .",
    "we will see in the next section that this fixed point is also a limit of an arbitrary network subject to `` strong '' perturbations of the same kind .    in what follows we",
