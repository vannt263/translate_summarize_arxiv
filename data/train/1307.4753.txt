    "observations of the secondary eclipse event , when the planet is blocked by the host star , is the predominant method of measuring the emergent flux of close - in exoplanets .",
    "in particular , secondary eclipses observed at multiple wavelength bands have provided first spectral energy distribution of exoplanets @xcite .",
    "similar observations have revealed the presence of molecular absorption features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the emission spectra of hot - jupiters , and hinted at the diversity of chemical compositions across exoplanet atmospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "wasp-19b @xcite is a @xmath3 , @xmath4 exoplanet in a 0.79 day prograde orbit @xcite which transits a @xmath5 g dwarf .",
    "the equilibrium temperature for the planet is at least 2000k , making it one of the hottest hot - jupiters known , and the most favourable target for eclipse observations .",
    "the proximity of wasp-19b to the host star also makes it an interesting case study of irradiated atmospheres .",
    "in particular , eclipse observations have shown that wasp-19b is inconsistent with the hypothesis that highly irradiated planets exhibit thermal inversion features @xcite , although some exceptions are known ( e.g. hd189733b , tres-3b , and xo-1b , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite proposed wasp-19b as a planet hosting a carbon rich atmosphere , depleted in tio , which is a primary absorber for inversion layers .",
    "in addition , the carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( c / o ) is a potential indicator for the location in the proto - planetary disk where these hot - jupiters originated ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the c / o enrichment hypothesis is based upon existing multi - band eclipse observations of wasp-19b , including the astep400 broadband centred at @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath0 band @xcite , @xmath7 narrow band @xcite , @xmath8 band , @xmath9 band @xcite , spitzer 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath10 bands @xcite , as well as spectrophotometric observations at @xmath11 by @xcite . however , it is difficult to produce a single model that can fit all the measurements within their uncertainty constraints .",
    "ground based observations at the 0.1% level remain difficult , and are affected by a range of systematic effects , such as atmospheric variations , unstable telescope tracking , and detector defects .",
    "independent confirmation observations are required to strengthen the reliability of individual measurements .",
    "the depth of the @xmath0 band eclipse is particularly important in determining the c / o ratio of wasp-19b , a deeper eclipse is indicative of an atmosphere deficient in tio absorption and enriched in c / o abundance .",
    "new technology telescope ultracam observations by @xcite reported an eclipse depth of @xmath12 , whilst a combined set of observations with eulercam and trappist over ten epochs by @xcite reported a shallower eclipse depth of @xmath13 .",
    "whilst these observations are consistent at the @xmath14 regime , the difference between the two measurements makes it difficult to constrain the atmosphere models of wasp-19b .    in this study",
    ", we present an independent observation of a wasp-19b eclipse event using faulkes telescope south aimed at confirming its @xmath0 band secondary eclipse depth .",
    "we present a careful treatment of the photometry to achieve near photon - limited lightcurves . to investigate the previous claim of a carbon rich atmosphere , we use the vstar radiative transfer code @xcite and the ensemble of observations to model the atmosphere of wasp-19b and examine the effects of temperature - pressure profiles and c / o abundance on its emergent spectrum .",
    "one draw back of existing model retrieval studies @xcite is its lack of treatment for non - isotropic scattering .",
    "the lack of absorption features in the transmission spectrum in hd189733b @xcite , as well as the weaker than expected detections of sodium in various hot - jupiters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all point to the importance of clouds and haze in modelling planetary atmospheres .",
    "we also exploit the rigorous treatment of rayleigh scattering by vstar to investigate the effect of upper atmosphere haze on the emission spectrum of wasp-19b .",
    "we monitored an eclipse of wasp-19b using the 2 m faulkes telescope south ( fts ) , located at siding spring observatory , australia , on 2012 december 29 , from 12:0315:50 ut , with the expected eclipse occurring during 13:2515:02 ut .",
    "observations were performed in the pan - starrs @xmath0-band , centred at @xmath15 @xcite , using the merope @xmath16 camera , with @xmath17 field of view , unbinned pixel size of @xmath18 , read out with @xmath19 bins .",
    "@xmath20 exposures were taken .",
    "the seeing on the night previous to the observing sequence was @xmath21 .",
    "the telescope was slightly defocused to avoid saturation and to reduce the effect of intra- and residual inter - pixel variations , resulting in point spread functions ( psf ) with full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath22 .",
    "bias subtraction and flat field corrections were performed using the ccdproc package in _ _ iraf _ _ with the most recent archival calibration frames .",
    "an example image is shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "band image of the wasp-19 field .",
    "the target , located in the centre of the field , is circled in red ; the chosen set of reference stars are circled in white .",
    "the size of the circle indicates the size of the background aperture .",
    "the column of dead pixels in the top left of the image was masked out for the photometry.,width=302 ]        upon close examination of the images , we find the stellar psf is asymmetric across the image . the distortion and elongation of the psf is a result of the defocusing applied .",
    "in addition , the position angle of the elongated psf changes with the rotation of the telescope ( figure  [ fig : psf ] ) , as fts is on an alt - az mount . to further investigate the psf variations , we create a template psf from a single exposure taken mid - run , and fit it to the remaining exposures , allowing for rotation and spatial dilation . we find no significant deviations in the fit residuals , with the exception of the initial images taken at high airmass , suggesting that the general shape of the psf remained constant throughout the night .",
    "we performed elliptical aperture photometry on the reduced images .",
    "compared to conventional circular apertures , variable elliptical apertures best account for all of the stellar flux whilst minimising background noise .",
    "the ellipse parameters , semi - major axis @xmath23 , semi - minor axis @xmath24 , and position angle @xmath25 , were measured using source extractor , and are plotted in figure  [ fig : params ] , along with other relevant global parameters . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the maximum and minimum root - mean - square ( rms ) of the spatial profile .",
    "the size of the aperture , @xmath26 , is a scaling factor that maintains the shape and orientation of the ellipse , and is related to the ellipse parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 by , @xmath30 the lowest out - of - eclipse scatter was achieved using aperture sizes of @xmath31 , enclosing @xmath32 of the flux .",
    "the adopted elliptical aperture parameters @xmath33 were determined from linear fits in time to the averaged measurements from sourced extractor .",
    "higher order fits to the ellipse parameters were tested , and did not result in significantly different lightcurves or eclipse depths .",
    "exposures with @xmath34 were discarded from the analysis , since they were taken at high airmass , when the psf shape varied rapidly .",
    "the background was estimated using a 100 pixel diameter outer aperture on a background image with all detected sources masked out .",
    "since wasp-19 resides in a relatively crowded field , masking out field stars is essential to achieving optimal background subtraction .",
    "we note that @xcite followed a similar technique in their analysis .",
    "the background count around wasp-19 is plotted in figure  [ fig : params ]    differential photometry was performed using five reference stars ( labelled in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ) , chosen for their lack of nearby neighbours , similar colour indices to the target , and the eventual stability of the lightcurves .",
    "a master reference lightcurve @xmath35 was created by averaging the ensemble of reference stars @xmath36 , each with errors @xmath37 : @xmath38 where weights @xmath39 were chosen to minimise the rms scatter of the corrected object lightcurve .",
    "the use of weights to minimise the object lightcurve scatter is similar to applying the trend filtering algorithm to the out - of - transit dataset @xcite . to remove uncorrelated trends in the individual reference star lightcurves , we divided each reference star by a master reference lightcurve made of all other reference stars .",
    "any slow varying residual trends in that reference star were then corrected for by a linear fit .",
    "in addition , individual outlier points significantly different from other reference stars were removed by sigma clipping .",
    "finally , a linear trend was removed from the target lightcurve by fitting for the out - of - eclipse points .",
    "we note that the target lightcurve was treated by the same processes as the reference lightcurves .",
    "the ensemble of raw reference lightcurves , as well as the raw target lightcurve , are plotted in figure  [ fig : params ] .",

    "the derived brightness temperature agrees well with the astep , 1.6 and 2.09@xmath10 temperatures @xcite .",
    "the depth can also be derived separately by binning the in- and out - of - eclipse points . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] , we bin the points according to the predicted ephemeris .",
    "the eclipse depth , given by the difference in the sigma clipped mean of the two bins , is @xmath48 , with the uncertainty taken as the error in the mean of the two bins , added in quadrature .",
    "this agrees with the transit depth measured by the model fit .      most high - precision transit and eclipse photometry to date",
    "have been processed with some form of external parameter decorrelation to remove residual systematic trends .",
    "this is often done by multiplying the lightcurve with a linear combination of external parameters , such as airmass , position , fwhm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; occasionally , higher order terms have also been employed ( e.g. up to 4@xmath49 order * ? ? ?",
    "we test for the effectiveness of detrending by simultaneously fitting for the eclipse and a combination of external terms involving x , y position , semi - major axis @xmath23 , ellipticity @xmath50 , airmass , and background counts , whilst holding @xmath42 constant . in each case , the removal of a linear trend is also allowed .",
    "analysis is performed over the entire lightcurve , since the out - of - eclipse points constitute less than half of the observations , and can not sufficiently represent the entire dataset .",

    "the lack of need for any decorrelation can be primarily attributed to the use of variable , elliptical , apertures .",
    "we use the vstar line - by - line radiative transfer code @xcite to derive a model atmosphere of wasp-19b that fits our measurement and the data published previously .",
    "vstar is a comprehensive atmospheric radiative transfer model incorporating a chemical equilibrium model , an extensive database of molecular spectral lines and a full treatment of multiple - scattering radiative transfer using the discrete ordinate method .",
    "it has been extensively tested and applied to objects ranging from solar system planets @xcite to m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to obtain a unique model that can best fit the currently available broadband data that only sparsely covers the optical and infrared spectrum .",
    "instead we focus on a discussion of effects observed in a spectrum by changing specific conditions in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "highly irradiated planets , like wasp-19b , have been hypothesised to show thermal inversion in its atmospheric profile due to condensation of vo and tio within a cold trap @xcite .",
    "however the spitzer irac data @xcite and near infrared ground measurements at 1.6 and 2.1 @xmath60 m appear to be inconsistent with thermal inversion in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "various explanations have been proposed for the lack of thermal inversion in some highly irradiated planets , such as the dependency on the presence of a cold trap @xcite , destruction of absorbers by stellar activity @xcite , disequilibrium photochemistry @xcite , or the enrichment of c / o that leads to depleted tio abundance @xcite .    in our modelling",
    "we use four different atmospheric pressure  temperature ( p - t ) profiles without inversion ( figure  [ fig : atmos]a ) : ( i ) the red profile in fig.12 of @xcite ; ( ii ) a ` hotter ' profile , which corresponds to conditions discussed by @xcite ; ( iii ) a ` cooler ' profile which reflects range of temperatures and pressures assumed by @xcite to explain their near infrared data ; ( iv ) a ` narrow ' p - t profile , with reduced range of temperatures that overlap with the @xcite model over the range of 0.05 - 0.5 bar .    our models assume a plane - parallel , stratified atmosphere with 25 layers characterised by temperature , pressure and mixing ratios of the following molecular and atomic species : h@xmath61o , co , ch@xmath62 , co@xmath61 , c@xmath61h@xmath61 , hcn , tio , vo , na , k , h@xmath61 , he , rb , cs , cah , crh , mgh and feh . mixing ratios of these opacity sources",
    "are calculated in chemical equilibrium .",
    "atmospheres of hot - jupiters like wasp-19b are most likely dominated by h@xmath61 , which is a source of the h@xmath61-h@xmath61 and h@xmath61-he collisionally induced absorption ( cia ) that we included with opacities calculated by @xcite .",
    "we also considered rayleigh scattering by h@xmath61 , he , h in the atmosphere of the planet , and free - free and bound - free absorption from h , h@xmath63 and h@xmath61@xmath63 .",

    "all models presented in this figure have carbon to oxygen ratio c / o=1.1 .",
    "thus they can be easily compared with the red spectrum in fig.12 of @xcite .",
    "the differences between our model and the @xcite model with the same p - t profile can be attributed to use of line databases which may have varied levels of completeness .",
    "the model with ` hotter ' p - t profile tends to fit better near infrared ( nir ) data from and @xcite , while ` cooler ' p - t profile produces a spectrum that matches closer to the data obtained by @xcite .",
    "however both these profiles either overestimate or underestimate absorption observed in the spitzer data between 3.6 and 8 @xmath60 m .",
    "we also found very little difference between the ` narrow ' p - t profile and the one from @xcite , with only slightly increased absorption between 1 and 2@xmath60 m in the ` narrow ' p - t profile .                in figure",
    "[ fig : atmos1 ] we show the effect of varying c / o ratio on spectra using example of a model with our hottest p - t profile , although qualitative results are the same for other profiles considered here .",

    "/ o=1 the abundances of carbon and oxygen containing molecules change dramatically by many orders of magnitudes .",
    "this explains the rapid decrease of h@xmath61o absorptions in the spectra when c / o ratio varies between 0.9 and 1.1 in right panel of figure  [ fig : atmos1 ] , while only modest changes are visible in left panel of figure  [ fig : atmos1 ] between c / o=1.1 and c / o=4.0 .",
    "spectra of atmospheres with high content of carbon are dominated by ch@xmath62 absorption in addition of molecules such as hcn and c@xmath61h@xmath61 considered also in @xcite . while strong water absorption bands are absent",
    ", the co features around 2.3 and 4.8 @xmath60 m become more prominent .",
    "currently available spectral measurements for wasp-19b seem to be more consistent with the atmosphere models which are derived with the c / o ratio higher than solar .",
    "models presented so far in figure  [ fig : atmos ] assumed a clear atmosphere .",
    "however recently published data for the hot - jupiter hd189733b @xcite indicate a presence of haze in the top layers of its atmosphere .",
    "composition of hazes depends on the abundance and refractory properties of different compounds @xcite . in hot - jupiters and",
    "brown dwarfs suggested condensates may be formed by highly refractory species such as perovskite ( catio@xmath65 ) and corundum ( al@xmath61o@xmath65 ) , which condense in temperatures close to 1600  k. more abundant si , mg and fe elements combine into compounds such as enstatite ( mgsio@xmath65 ) and forsterite ( mg@xmath61sio@xmath62 ) that condense in lower temperatures . even at the relatively lower temperatures at the top of the atmosphere of",
    "wasp-19b it is not clear which species could potentially exists in a form of haze .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tau ] we assume that such a haze exists and it is composed of unknown particulate with refractive index similar to enstatite . four examples of the model spectrum are shown for wasp-19b , where the optical depth of a cloud in the top layer of the atmosphere is varied .",
    "the particles with a mean size of 0.5 @xmath60 m are assumed in the left panel . on the right",
    "all models are derived with the varied mean size of particles , while the same optical depth @xmath66 at 1.5 @xmath60 m is assumed .",
    "the absorption and scattering properties as a function of wavelength are calculated using mie theory . at wavelengths comparable to the size of cloud particles ,",
    "scattering processes operate efficiently , which leads to increase of planetary albedo in the corresponding part of its spectrum . on the other hand the added opacity in top layers",
    "obscures thermal emission from the planet , which has an effect of lowering the received flux in infrared part of a spectrum .",
    "differences in particle sizes affect both scattering and absorption properties of the haze .",
    "particles smaller than 0.5 @xmath60 m appear to generate highly reflective haze at visible wavelengths , which may not be consistent with the measurement from @xcite .",
    "observations of secondary eclipses at different wavelengths are sensitive to different properties of the planetary atmosphere . observations of the flux in z - band",
    "can provide a sensitive probe of the c / o ratio in the atmosphere of the planet , as shown in figure  [ fig : atmos1 ] . in optical spectrum strongly absorbing bands of vo and tio",
    "dominate the measured flux in temperatures above 1700  k when the c / o ratio is similar to solar .",
    "after vo and tio start to condense below this temperature , absorption from alkali lines and water bands takes over",
    ". however if c / o is higher than solar , alkali lines will be distinct even at lower temperatures due to reduced abundance of vo and tio .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of stratospheric haze rayleigh scattering may dominate optical spectrum almost entirely as seen in figure  [ fig : tau ] .",
    "a few more strategically placed photometric data points in optical and near infrared spectrum will help to discriminate between these broad conditions of the wasp-19b atmosphere .",
    "however more detailed and unique models can only be derived when the amount of photometric data becomes sufficient to break degeneracies in interpretation of current spectral features .",
    "this is currently rather remote prospect as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we presented an examination of the emission spectrum of wasp-19b measured in eclipse . using fts observations , we measured the @xmath0 band eclipse depth to be @xmath1 .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with the depth measured by @xcite of @xmath12 , and also consistent with the tentative detection of a significant eclipse in the optical astep band by @xcite , as well as deep nir detections by .",
    "it is also in @xmath67 agreement with the measurement made using multiple eclipses from the 1.2 m euler - swiss telescope and the 0.6 m trappist telescope of @xmath13 @xcite .    from the non - exhaustive set of vstar spectra , we find no single model that can fit all of the reported observations .",
    "however , when the spectrophotometry measurements by @xcite are discarded , the c / o enriched models present a good fit to the remaining points .",
    "the @xcite points are also inconsistent with available photometric @xmath68 measurements at the same wavelengths .",
    "we also note that our new @xmath0 band detection is consistent in brightness temperature with the photometric near - infrared detections , not the spectrophotometry measurement .",
    "these difficulties highlight the challenges of transit spectrophotometry observations , especially when wasp-19 is the faintest object targeted with the technique to date .",
    "@xcite assessed the difficulty of interpreting broadband emission spectra via retrieval techniques , and noted that c / o classifications tend towards a bimodal posterior of 0.5 or 1 .",
    "this agrees with our assessment that large - scale changes in the spectrum are only apparent from c / o of 0.9 to 1.1 .",
    "although a quantitative estimate of carbon enrichment in these atmospheres is unlikely , wasp-19b is still more consistent with a super - solar c / o composition .",
    "in addition to wasp-19b , @xcite pointed to xo-1b , corot-2b , wasp-33b , and wasp-12b as carbon rich candidates .",
    "xo-1b is a significantly less irradiated planet that has only been studied in the spitzer bands @xcite .",
