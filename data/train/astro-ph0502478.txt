    "fifteen years ago , terlevich , daz & terlevich ( 1990 , hereinafter tdt ) carried out the first systematic study of the @xmath08498,8542,8662   absorption lines of the ca ii ion in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the main focus of that pioneer work on the `` calcium triplet '' ( cat ) was on the equivalent width of this feature ( @xmath3 ) , which provides both a stellar population diagnostic and a tool to investigate the presence of an underlying non - stellar continuum .",
    "most of the agn in the tdt sample were type 2 seyferts .",
    "their main finding was that @xmath3 is remarkably similar for seyfert 2s and normal galaxies , implying that the non - stellar featureless continuum ( fc ) invoked to account for the dilution of optical absorption lines in these objects either is not featureless at all or somehow disappears between optical and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "the interpretation advanced by tdt was that both the optical fc and the cat lines are produced by a nuclear starburst .",
    "subsequent work by the same group suggests that this may also apply to at least some type 1 seyferts ( jimnez - benito 2000 ) , although in the more active of these objects the agn continuum does cause some dilution of the cat .    since then , the existence of starbursts around seyfert 2 nuclei has been established by both indirect means ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ; heckman 1995 ; oliva 1999 ) and direct detections of young stars by optical  uv imaging and spectroscopy ( heckman 1997 ; gonzlez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ) . while these studies confirmed that the optical fc of seyfert 2s is predominantly due to recent star - formation , there are still doubts as to whether the cat is produced by these starbursts or by older stars in the host galaxy bulge . in other words",
    ", it is not clear whether the cat can be used to diagnose the presence of starbursts .",
    "indeed , the mere fact that @xmath3 shows little variation among galaxies of widely different morphological and spectroscopic properties indicates that this feature may not be as simple a tracer of stellar populations as initially thought .",
    "recent empirical and theoretical work reinforce this idea ( cenarro 2003 , 2004 ; saglia 2002 ; falcn - barroso 2003 ; michielsen 2003 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; vazdekis 2003 ) , and show that there is still much to be learned about the cat behaviour even in normal galaxies .",
    "a more widespread use of the cat nowadays is to measure stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this was the approach followed by nelson & whittle ( 1995 and 1996 ; hereinafter collectively revered to as nw ) in their comprehensive study of stellar and gaseous kinematics of agn .",
    "the discovery of the relation between black - hole mass ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath2 ( ferrarese & merrit 2000 ; gebhardt 2000 ; tremaine 2002 ) brought renewed interest in this kind of work . indeed ,",
    "most of the current observational cat studies in agn are geared towards using this spectroscopic feature as an indirect black - hole weighing - scale ( ferrarese 2001 ; barth , ho & sargent 2002 , 2003 ; filippenko & ho 2003 ; barth 2004 ; botte 2004 ; nelson 2004 ; onken 2004 ; barth , greene & ho 2005 )",
    ". finally , velocity dispersions are also useful to investigate stellar populations . combined with size and luminosity measurements",
    ", @xmath2 allows the estimation of the mass - to - light ratio , which is a strong function of the age in stellar systems .",
    "there have been few applications of this idea to agn , but the results reported so far seem to fit the scenario where active nuclei tend to be surrounded by stellar populations younger than those typical of elliptical galaxies and bulges ( nw ; oliva 1995 ; 1999 ) .",
    "this brief summary illustrates that there is plenty of motivation to study the cat in both active and normal galaxies .",
    "in this paper we present an atlas of cat spectra and related data products for a sample of 78 galaxies , most of which have active nuclei .",
    "this material is used in a companion paper ( vega 2005 , hereafter paper ii ) to address issues such as the connection between nebular and stellar kinematics , the sensitivity of @xmath3 to stellar population properties , and constraints on the contribution of a non - stellar component to the nir spectra of agn .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the sample , observations and data reduction .",
    "section [ sec : atlas ] presents our atlas of cat spectra , as well as [ siii]@xmath79069 emission line profiles for a subset of the objects .",
    "measurements of stellar velocity dispersions are presented section [ sec : vel_disp ] , while section [ sec : ews ] presents results on the equivalent width of the cat .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our main results .",
    "the data presented here were obtained in 6 runs in 3 different telescopes : two at the 1.52 m eso - la silla ( 39 galaxies ) , two at the kpno 2.1 m ( 25 galaxies ) , and two at the kpno 4 m telescope ( 16 galaxies ) .",
    "although the original projects had somewhat different specific goals , they all centered on the measurement of the cat in agn .",
    "we have thus decided to merge all the cat - related data in a single atlas containing the nuclear spectra and associated data - products , processed in a way as homogeneous as possible .",
    "this section describes the observations , reduction process and the general sample properties .",

    "very similar results are obtained comparing our ccm - based estimates of @xmath2 with literature data , which also yields an rms of 22 km / s . given the differences in data quality , spatial extractions , method of analysis , and the intrinsic uncertainties in @xmath2 , we conclude that there are no significant differences between our estimates of @xmath2 and those reported in previous studies . in any case , the level of agreement is very similar to those among other studies .",
    "we also made a compilation from oliva et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) near - ir co and si @xmath2 estimates , where we can find 9 objects in common with our sample .",
    "although the two estimates are very likely to be correlated ( p@xmath29 2.5% ) , here the difference between results is higher than when compared with optical data , indicating that our estimated @xmath2 is , on average , lower by 34 km / s . considering just the 6 objects that have an `` a '' fitting quality , this difference practically does not change ( 33 km / s ) , having a rms of 38 km / s ( i.e. , agrees with our results within a 0.05 confidence level , considering that their errors are also of 20 km / s ) .",
    "besides its use as a tracer of stellar kinematics , the cat provides information on the properties of stellar populations in galaxies .",
    "the most extensive and up - to - date study of the cat in stars and as a diagnostic of stellar populations in galaxies has been published by cenarro and co - workers in the last few years ( cenarro 2001a , 2001b , 2002 , 2003 ; vazdekis 2003 ) . as summarized in the introduction ( see also paper ii ) , recent work reveals serious difficulties in interpreting the observed strength of the cat in normal galaxies , which in turn raises doubts as to the usefulness of the cat as a stellar population diagnostic .",
    "clearly , the situation in agn ought to be even more problematic than for normal galaxies , given : ( 1 ) the presence of emission lines around the cat , ( 2 ) the fact that many agn are known to be surrounded by starbursts of various ages and intensities , and ( 3 ) the presence of an underlying non - stellar continuum , seen either directly ( in seyfert 1s ) or scattered ( seyfert 2s ) .",
    "notwithstanding these caveats , in this section we present measurements of the cat equivalent width for objects in our sample .",
    "these data is used in paper ii to evaluate the presence of an agn continuum at nir wavelengths , and to investigate how our agn fit into the cat-@xmath2 relation ( e.g. , michielsen 2003 ) .",
    "we measure the cat strength following cenarro ( 2001a ) , who offer two definitions of the cat equivalent width : ` cat ' ( which we call @xmath3 ) , which consists of a sum of the equivalent widths of all three cat lines , and ` cat * ' ( called @xmath30 here ) , which corrects @xmath3 for contamination by paschen line absorption .",
    "these equivalent widths are measured with respect to a continuum defined by fitting the spectrum in 5 windows in the 84748792 range .",
    "it is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : atlas_eso_a][fig : atlas_kpno2 m ] that this recipe can not be blindly applied to our spectra , given the presence of emission lines , atmospheric and noise artifacts which affect both the continuum , cat and paschen bandpasses . on the other hand , in section [ sec : dfm ]",
    "we have seen that the dfm provides good matches to the clean regions of the spectra .",
    "naturally , these model spectra do not suffer from the aforementioned problems .",
    "measuring the cat indices over the model fits is therefore a simpler alternative to removing the unwanted features from the observed spectra .",
    "( a similar strategy was employed by cid fernandes 2004 in their analysis of optical spectra of seyfert 2s . )",
    "we thus opted to measure both @xmath31 and @xmath30 over the synthetic spectra .",
    "we tested the validity of this procedure by comparing the values of @xmath3 measured for the model ( @xmath32 ) and observed ( @xmath33 ) spectra for galaxies with no serious contamination , or galaxies where the spurious features can be easily removed ( say , by chopping narrow emission lines ) . we find that these two estimates of @xmath3 agree well , with an rms difference of 0.4  .",
    "there is a small bias , in the sense that @xmath3 values measured over the synthetic spectra are on average 0.5   smaller than those measured over the observed spectrum , generally due to noise in the redder continuum band .",
    "both this offset and the rms difference are comparable to the formal uncertainties in @xmath3 .",
    "we thus conclude that this experiment validates our strategy of measuring @xmath3 over the model spectra .",
    "although cenarro ( 2001a ) and subsequent studies of normal galaxies favour @xmath30 over @xmath3 as a measure of the cat strength , we have reasons to do the opposite choice .",
    "firstly , in several cases our dfm fits concentrate on windows centered nearly exclusively on the cat lines .",
    "hence , paschen lines , even if present in the spectrum ( which is not the case in any of our spectra , with the possible exception of the normal galaxy ngc 6907 ) , would not have a relevant weight in the spectral fits .",
    "secondly , only the kpno 2.1 m observations include velocity standard stars with paschen absorption lines in their spectra ( f giants ; see table [ tab : velocitystandards ] ) .",
    "for the other runs , the spectral base @xmath34 does not cover such spectral types , so the synthetic spectrum can not possibly model any paschen line absorption properly , thus rendering the paschen line correction in @xmath30 meaningless .",
    "hence , we only present @xmath3 measurements ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .    since the @xmath32 spectra are effectively noiseless , in order to compute uncertainties in @xmath3 we carried out a formal propagation using the @xmath35 derived for each galaxy ( section [ sec : cat_atlas ] ) .",
    "to be on the conservative side , we further add 0.5   in quadrature to account for the empirically established rms difference between @xmath3 measurements performed over @xmath32 and over clean @xmath33 spectra .",
    "the median uncertainties are @xmath36 , 0.7 and 0.8   for quality _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ spectra respectively .",
    "inspection of the @xmath3 values in table  [ tab : results ] shows that this index spans a range of values from @xmath37 to 9  . however , most values are within the 68   range , giving the false impression that stellar populations are very homogeneous in our sample .",
    "this is definitely not true , as we know from independent work at other wavelengths for many of the same galaxies studied here ( e.g. , cid fernandes 2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "instead , the small variation in cat strength reinforces the notion that this feature is not much sensitive to stellar population properties .",
    "the only noticeable trend is that seyfert 1s tend to have weaker cat than other galaxies . on the mean , @xmath38   ( sample dispersion ) for seyfert 1s and @xmath39   for seyfert 2s .",
    "the statistics for the 3 starbursts in our sample is @xmath40  , while for the remaining 6 non - active galaxies @xmath41  , very similar to the values spanned by seyfert 2s .",
    "the most likely origin for the difference between type 1 and type 2 agn is dilution by an underlying non - stellar featureless continuum in type 1s .",
    "hence , if on the one hand @xmath3 turns out to be a rather poor tracer of stellar populations , it seems to be a good fc detector .",
    "these aspects are explored in greater depth in paper ii .",
    "this paper presented a spectroscopic atlas of 78 galaxies in the region around the calcium triplet ( cat ) .",
    "most of the objects are agn , split into 43 type 2 seyferts and 26 type 1s . the spectra cover the inner @xmath42 pc with a typical s / n of 40 .",
    "quality flags were assigned to each spectrum to describe the degree of contamination of the cat absortion lines by emission lines or atmospheric features .",
    "the main products from our analysis of this data set are stellar velocity dispersions , [ siii]@xmath79069 line profiles , and cat equivalent widths .",
    "stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath2 ) were measured for 72 of the spectra using both direct fitting and cross - correlation methods .",
    "the two techniques yield results compatible to within an rms of 19 km / s , which is also the typical uncertainty of our estimates .",
    "comparison with @xmath2 values reported in the literature for objects in common agree with our estimates at the level of @xmath43 km / s rms for optical data , and at a 2 sigma level for near - ir data .",
    "we have also analyzed the [ siii]@xmath79069 line profiles for 40 galaxies in the sample with useful data in this range .",
    "single gaussian fits were performed , producing estimates of line width and equivalent width .",
    "the cat equivalent width was measured over the synthetic spectra obtained from the direct fits , circumventing the manual editing of the spectra which would be required to remove undesirable features which affect @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath3 in seyfert 2s and normal galaxies are concentrated in a relatively small range , from @xmath44 to 8  .",
    "type 1 seyferts tend to have a weaker cat , most likely due to dilution by a non - stellar continuum .",
    "these data products are analyzed in paper ii , where we investigate the relation between nebular and stellar kinematics and the behaviour of the cat strength as a function of activity type and stellar population properties .",
