    "the determination of the low temperature properties , and ultimately the ground state phase diagram , of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems of strongly interacting electrons at low carrier density in the presence of low levels of disorder remains a very challenging problem in spite of a great deal of experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "the longstanding view that all charge carrier states become localized at zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) in the limit of a large 2d system has been called into question by experimental observations of a finite temperature `` transition '' from insulator - like ( @xmath2 ) to metal - like ( @xmath3 ) behavior as the electron density is increased in very high purity semiconductor mosfets and heterostructures @xcite .",
    "this bifurcation of the resistivity @xmath4 into two families of curves occurs at a critical carrier density of the 2d electron ( or hole ) system .",
    "the critical carrier density depends on the specific disorder characteristics of the given sample . in the vicinity of the bifurcation , @xmath4 has intriguing scaling properties as a function of density and temperature .",
    "the lower density insulating family of curves having @xmath5 can be collapsed onto a single curve when plotted as a function of a scaling variable @xmath6 .",
    "the new density dependent temperature scale @xmath7 has a power law dependence on the magnitude of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical density at the bifurcation .",
    "similarly , the metallic family of curves at higher density with @xmath10 collapses onto another unique curve with a power law dependence on @xmath6 with precisely the same critical exponent . there is also scaling behavior with respect to density via @xmath11 and applied electric field , with a different characteristic critical exponent .",
    "a review has been given by abrahams _",
    "et al _ @xcite .    a bifurcation with scaling behavior at finite @xmath12 is expected to be a generic feature associated with a @xmath1 quantum critical point ( qcp)@xcite .",
    "consequently , the demonstrated scaling for the resistivity can be taken as evidence for a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) . with this assumption ,",
    "dobrosavljevi _ et al _ have given a phenomenological description of the observed scaling properties and power laws in terms of a one - parameter scaling theory @xcite .",
    "in this picture , the bifurcation point lies on a separatrix which terminates at @xmath1 at a qcp which is a fixed point of a set of scaling equations .",
    "the fixed point is repulsive with respect to the temperature variable and separates the insulating and metallic regions of the low t phase diagram .",
    "there is a unique correspondence between the qcp and the bifurcation point and a two - phase ground state is implied .",
    "however , this correspondence provides only indirect evidence for a mit .",
    "of course the power law fits near the bifurcation point are based on linearization of a scaling flow equation and the linearization must eventually fail at sufficiently low temperature , for which @xmath6 is no longer small , but this is not evidence against a qcp .",
    "a more crucial point is that a physical effect which is negligible for temperatures @xmath13 k near the bifurcation , may become dominant in the low @xmath12 limit . scaling properties characteristic of an imminent qcp",
    "would then still be observed near the bifurcation but the suggested qcp itself could be totally removed in the zero temperature limit .",
    "a possible example of this situation is the proposal by simmons _",
    "et al _ @xcite that in @xmath14-type gaas the @xmath4 curves of the metallic family will eventually turn upward to exhibit insulator - like behavior with @xmath15 if the electron temperature @xmath12 could be made sufficiently low .",
    "a similar conclusion has recently been reached for si mosfets .",
    "@xcite however the turn - up is actually only directly observed for metallic curves just above the critical density , and , as we discuss below , the magnetoresistance data cited as evidence of a universal weak localization in 2d in refs . and may alternatively reflect different magnetic field dependencies of the competing localizing and delocalizing triplet spin state interactions .",
    "irrespective of the mechanism responsible for the upturn , properties of the system at temperatures well below the bifurcation temperature are not correctly described by a one - component scaling theory .",
    "we will outline a semi - empirical two - component scaling theory that describes within a single framework the temperature dependent resistivity both in the vicinity of the bifurcation and in the low resistance metallic regime .",
    "following early work by altshuler _",
    "et al _ @xcite further progress toward an understanding of disordered 2d electron systems in the strong coupling regime was made by finkelstein @xcite and by castellani _",
    "et al _ @xcite who showed that electron - electron interactions can lead to @xmath16 ( metallic behavior ) in the disordered 2d system at finite @xmath12 .",
    "this is in contrast to the localizing insulating behavior found in the absence of electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the system at low @xmath12 are determined by nonlinear interactions of low energy diffusive modes .",
    "a set of renormalization group ( rg ) equations was generated by means of a formal perturbation expansion in powers of a dimensionless temperature dependent resistivity @xmath17 which is related to the physical resistance per square by @xmath18 .",
    "these scaling results include electron - electron interactions to all orders and are valid in the diffusive regime @xmath19 provided @xmath17 is small ( in principle , @xmath20 ) .",
    "additional progress was made by zala _",
    "et al _ @xcite who considered interaction corrections to transport properties at intermediate temperatures in the ballistic regime @xmath21 to all orders in the electron - electron interaction using a fermi - liquid approach .",
    "these results are also restricted to the perturbative regime , @xmath20 .",
    "comparisons with experiment for the temperature dependent resistivity of si mosfets have been made for both the scaling theory @xcite and the intermediate temperature theory @xcite .",
    "the intermediate temperature theory gives consistent semi - quantitative agreement with experiment in the range of densities for which @xmath17 is small .",
    "we emphasize that both these theories are perturbative in @xmath17 and are limited to the regime of small @xmath17 .",
    "hence they must fail to describe the regime near bifurcation where @xmath22 and they contain no bifurcation point .",
    "in addition , in the rg procedure the equations develop singularities at a nonzero temperature so that the approach to the ground state can not be described .",
    "in contrast to the 2d case there is a qualitative understanding of the metal - insulator transition in 3d electron systems .",
    "a consistent qualitative picture of the transition has been obtained by rg methods in a space of dimension @xmath23 with @xmath24 taken as an expansion parameter .",
    "physical quantities such as critical exponents are expressed as power series in @xmath25 .",
    "while only the leading terms in @xmath25 have been obtained it is presumed that resummation methods would give good results in 3d if sufficient correction terms could be calculated . in the case of @xmath24 it",
    "is clear that the interplay of strong electron - electron interactions with disorder is an essential aspect of the bifurcation .",
    "it is remarkable that in spite of great effort a corresponding theory does not exist for 2d systems , that is for @xmath26 .",
    "this lack casts doubt on the physical significance and relevance of the `` universal '' aspects of electron - electron interactions in disordered systems .",
    "in addition the lack of even an approximate scaling theory has prevented quantitative discussion of the low temperature limit and the approach to the ground state .",
    "we expect that the interplay of strong electron - electron interactions with disorder must be an essential aspect of the bifurcation in 2d irrespective of whether or not a true metal - insulator transition occurs . of course in some systems material dependent effects also contribute .    in this paper",
    "we discuss why the lowest order rg equations in 2d do not show a bifurcation and we give a semi - empirical extension which does describe a bifurcation region .",
    "we focus on the immediate vicinity of the bifurcation and on the metallic regime .",
    "the strong insulator limit will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the proposed scaling equations have a physical low temperature limit and have no singularities at finite length or temperature scales .",
    "this scaling picture provides a theoretical framework for the interpretation of experimental results , more specifically the `` universal '' contributions due to electron - electron interactions and disorder .",
    "the rg equations established at one - loop level for a 2d system of electrons in the presence of disorder are based on four dimensionless scaling parameters @xmath17 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xcite where @xmath30 is the electron - hole scattering amplitude for the triplet spin state , @xmath31 is the singlet state particle - particle scattering amplitude and @xmath28 is the dynamical energy rescaling function .",
    "together with @xmath17 , these quantities are all functions of the variable @xmath32 which describes rescaling of the momenta after integrating over the momentum shell specified by @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite we consider only the case when the disorder is due to purely potential scattering .",
    "when a connection between length and temperature scaling is needed , we relate a thermal length @xmath34 to temperature by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the length and temperature scales for elastic scattering and @xmath38 is the dynamical critical exponent @xcite .",

    "when it is negative this term has the opposite trend of reducing the resistivity upon scaling .",

    "can be consistent with our scaling conclusions if , for example , the localizing contribution in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) has a stronger magnetic field dependence ( at small fields ) than the delocalizing contribution from the electron - electron interactions .",
