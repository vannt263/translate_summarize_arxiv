    "the formation of multi - quark systems can have important implications in the phenomena we observe in nature , from an enhanced spectroscopy to quark recombination effects .",
    "a tetraquark state , the simplest of this kind of systems , has been extensively studied from the theoretical and experimental point of view . recently",
    ", experimental research has provided strong evidence on the formation of such state @xcite .",
    "these findings signal a new era in hadron spectroscopy , where more refined modeling and a better understanding of the strong interaction , in the low energy regime , is required .",
    "since the early years of the quark model , theoretical studies have been performed to inquiry on the existence and stability of the tetraquark as an isolated object @xcite , and how its mixing with a meson state can help us to understand the observed spectroscopy of states like the @xmath2 meson @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid to the features of the tetraquark formation as two mesons are forced to approach each other as it could happen in a meson - meson collision or , on the opposite , when the four quarks are produced very close in space as in the @xmath3 decay , which eventually freeze out to two mesons @xcite . at which stage they turn into a tetraquark or mixed state ? and how their properties reflect such modification ?",
    "are certainly important questions .",
    "+ in the present work we address these questions using an effective model ( string - flip model ) to mimic the strong interaction among quarks . for definiteness",
    "we consider two identical light quarks @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath4 ) and two identical antiquarks @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , depending on the mass ratio respect to the light one ) .",
    "the seminal work by lenz _",
    "@xcite laid down a procedure to describe such a system in this context and found its general properties , as isolated objects , using a harmonic potential interaction . here , we perform a 3-d monte carlo simulation of the system including quantum correlations between particles to determine wether it is energetically more favorable to form a 4-body state ( tetraquark ) or two mesons , as a function of the interparticle separation which , for a fixed number of particles , can be identified as a particle density .",
    "we are interested in s - wave states where tensor and spin interaction effects are expected to be negligible in the gross features of the properties . in section ii , we set the basis to identify a quark - antiquark state interacting via a linear potential and elaborate on a variational approach . in section iii",
    ", we describe the dynamical quark recombination model and generalize the variational two body wavefunction to a four body system . in section iv",
    ", we describe the energy evaluation from monte carlo simulation . in section",
    "v , we show the results on : a ) the determination of the optimal variational parameter and system energy , b ) the hadron radial distribution characterization , c ) the two - particle correlation functions , among the two mesons and among quarks . in particular we provide a parameterization of the diquark correlation function and the static structure factor , d ) the dynamical recombination probabilities among mesons with / without tetraquark configurations , e ) we characterize the four body potential , estimating its linear behavior and its strength as an effective contact interaction .",
    "the conclusions are presented in section vi .",
    "let us start with the description of the exact solution and the variational approach of a meson state , composed of a quark and an antiquark of mass @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the strong interaction between this pair can be represented by an effective linear potential @xmath9 = k \\left\\vert \\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2 \\right\\vert = k r$ ] where @xmath10 is an interaction constant and @xmath11 is the relative distance between them .      for a three - dimensional space , one can analytically solve the corresponding schrdinger equation : @xmath12 \\psi \\left ( \\vec{r}_1,\\vec{r}_2 \\right ) = e \\",
    "\\psi \\left ( \\vec{r}_1,\\vec{r}_2 \\right).\\ ] ]    since the potential depends only on the relative distance , we can use the center of mass ( @xmath13 ) and relative distance ( @xmath14 ) vectors : @xmath15 and the wave function can be set as : @xmath16 we can neglect the center of mass contribution and focus in the relative distance schrdinger equation . considering an spherical symmetry , ( @xmath17=0 ) , the radial solution can be set as @xmath18 , such that the radial equation becomes : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the reduced mass .",
    "switching to the variable @xmath21    the schroedinger eqn .",
    "( [ schr1 ] ) takes the following form : @xmath22 whose general solution is a linear combination of the airy functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the second function is not considered as it has a bad behavior at large distances ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) . thus , the solution is : @xmath28    using the boundary condition at the origin @xmath29 , requires @xmath30 corresponding to the zeros of the airy function , @xmath31 , which then define the eigen - energies @xmath32 @xmath33^{1/3 } |\\xi_n| \\label{eairy3d}\\ ] ] and eigen - functions : @xmath34^{1/3 } - \\xi_n \\right).\\ ] ]    the ground state corresponds to the first zero of the airy function , with energy @xmath35 , in @xmath36 units .",
    "previous studies have explored how to approach a variational wave function that can account for this energy @xcite . here , we describe , in similar fashion , a family of 3-d variational wave functions that approach this value and find analytical expressions for the expected variational parameter , energy and mean square radius .",
    "the general variational wave function takes the following form : @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a normalization term , @xmath6 and @xmath39 are variational parameters and @xmath40 is the relative coordinate of the two - body system .",
    "we have found that using @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the wave function reproduces the exact minimum energy value within a 1% error .",
    "based on this analysis , for our description of the evolution of the system as a function of density , we fix the variational parameter @xmath6 to @xmath43 ( introducing only a 3% error on the energy in the zero density limit case ) and leave the @xmath39 parameter as the only free parameter . then , the normalized meson variational wave function becomes : @xmath44 analytical results can be obtained for the properties of the meson for this form of the variational wave function .",
    "the value of @xmath45 minimizing the energy is : @xmath46 corresponding to an energy of @xmath47    the mean square radius for the meson can be obtained following the general definition : @xmath48    in the meson case with particles of mass @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it becomes @xmath49 where the subindex @xmath50 is used to denote the isolated case .",
    "we can extend this analysis for quarks of different masses , in particular considering the constituent masses of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks , we set the ratio of their masses respect to the @xmath4 quark mass , taken as reference @xcite . in table",

    "that is @xmath57 in our case we consider the correlation to depend on the magnitude of @xmath58 . in figure [ sqdiquark ]",
    "we display the diquark static structure factor @xmath59 ( a ) and correlation function ( b ) in the limit of zero density for both @xmath60 ( solid line ) and @xmath61 ( dashed line ) tetraquark systems .",
    "the four quark recombination can have important effects in systems where they are produced very close in space .",
    "an example can be found in the @xmath62 decay , whose spatial separation at lep2 energies is around 0.1 fm @xcite .",
    "although in the perturbative regime the recombination is small , in the non - perturbative regime the effect may be important .",
    "the typical scenarios to estimate the recombination are : considering spherical or elongated bags color sources and the reconnection is proportional to the overlap of two color sources ; strings considered as vortex lines where reconnection takes place when the core of the two string pieces cross each other @xcite .",
    "the recombination between the two mesons configurations is usually implemented @xcite . in our case , we would have , in addition , recombinations similar to tetraquark states which eventually freeze out to two mesons . here",
    ", we characterize the modification to the two mesons recombination induced by the presence of the tetraquark state .",
    "+ the model requires that the formed clusters must be colorless .",
    "the flipping from one configuration to another , driven by the minimal potential energy restriction , is a measure of the dynamical recombination property of the system .",
    "we define the recombination probability for the two mesons case by : @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the number of flippings from the @xmath65 to the @xmath66 configuration , and @xmath67 is the number of times the system visits the @xmath65 configuration .",
    "if we consider the tetraquark configuration as another possible configuration contributing to the recombination , the probability becomes : @xmath68/ \\nonumber \\\\ &",
    "\\left[n(v_{m1})+n(v_{m2 } ) + n(v_{4q } ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in figure [ recombination ] , we show the probabilities as a function of the density .",
    "the probability for only two mesons recombination ( @xmath69 ) is exhibited for the two mesons and mixed cases ( see inner labels ) .",
    "the probability when tetraquarks are accounted as a recombination stage ( @xmath70 ) corresponds to the mixed case .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are for @xmath60 and @xmath61 systems respectively .",
    "a qualitative estimate of this effect can be exhibited considering a simple expansion model , such that we can evolve the system along the density profile .",
    "we can define the color strength function @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the probability that the system has not yet fragmented , with @xmath73 the proper lifetime , taken as three times the meson radius @xmath74 .",
    "@xcite the recombination probability @xmath75 can be set in terms of the radius of the sphere ( @xmath76 ) corresponding to the given density @xmath77 . in figure [ omega ] , we plot the evolution of the color strength as a function of the radial size of the system , in units of the meson radius .",
    "the case when considering the tetraquark and meson recombination ( @xmath70 ) largely modifies the estimate when not tetraquark state is included ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the flavor composition modifies the behavior at intermediate distances , and the total effect becomes negligible after four times the hadron radius , corresponding to nearly the size of the end of the overlap of two hadrons .",
    "the tetraquark potential depends on the quarks positions and two auxiliary vectors , placed in such away that the total length linking the quarks is the shortest one .",
    "these auxiliary vectors are modified in a non - trivial way whenever a single quark changes its position .",
    "an effective behavior of the potential can be set as linear respect to the invariant length , @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the value of the potential at zero distance , which is expected to be modified by the short distance coulomb - like correction @xcite . in figure [ linearpotential ] , we show the slope @xmath81 of the linear behavior from the simulation as a function of density for the case when only tetraquarks are allowed to form ( solid line ) and when mesons and tetraquarks are allowed to form ( dashed line ) .",
    "the slope , in the tetraquark case shows small dependence on the density , and @xmath82 . in the mixed case there is a significant density dependence , starting below the corresponding value at zero density ( @xmath83 ) and as the density increases they approach to each other .",
    "this behavior is similar when considering different flavor systems .    in figure",
    "[ contact ] , we show the effective four - body contact potential , @xmath84 , as a function of density , determined as the average potential irrespective of the length linking the particles . the pure tetraquar system ( solid and dashed lines for @xmath61 and @xmath60 flavors respectively ) exhibit a dependence on the mass ratio in the low energy regime and , as density increases , they become similar .",
    "the meson - tetraquark mixed system ( dotted line ) has no dependence on the mass ratio ( labeled as mixed ) , but is is very sensitive to the presence of the mesons , becoming very large in the low energy regime .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the increasing distance among quarks which are influenced by the two mesons configuration that is trying to bring them apart .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation of two identical light quarks @xmath0 and two identical antiquarks @xmath1 considering three possible structures : two mesons , tetraquark and mixed configurations .",
    "we determined wether it is energetically more favorable to form a tetraquark or two mesons and the mixing among them , as a function of the particle density .",
    "several light - quarks to antiquarks mass ratios were used and exhibited whenever they were found to be relevant .",
    "the meson msr evolution was found to be mass ratio dependent .",
    "in fact , the light - light combination ( @xmath60 ) decreases faster than the light - heavy case ( @xmath61 ) , while the dependence on being in presence of possible tetraquark configurations is mild .",
    "the tetraquark msr evolution also exhibits a mass ratio dependence , and turns out to be very sensitive to the presence of the mesons .",
    "we have shown that there is a modification in the meson - meson correlation function by the presence of the tetraquark state at intermediate densities , where a bump develops in the near tail of the correlation function , driven by the diquark formation . to gain insight on the features of the tetraquark state , we computed the quark - quark correlation function at several densities .",
    "we observed the diquark formation at low densities and the drop on the correlation as the density increased .",
    "the quantum correlations among identical particles appeared as pauli blocking in the short distance regime .",
    "in the zero density limit , we determined the correlation functions between quarks and the correlation between a quark and the rest of the particles .",
    "a parameterization was found , which is useful to compute additional static properties , in particular we computed the diquark static structure factor , which exhibited a small mass ratio dependence .",
    "we did track the dynamical flipping among configurations and determined the recombination probability evolution as a function of the particle density .",
    "we have shown that the probability is largely affected when considering the tetraquark as an intermediate recombination state . using a simple model evolution of the system along the density profile we have shown that the recombination effects remain important beyond a half the overlap of two mesons .",
    "the linear behavior of the four - body potential on the invariant length linking the quarks was analyzed and found that the presence of a mixed state is reflected in the decreasing strength of the slope .",
    "we determined an effective four - body contact potential as the average strength , irrespective of the length linking the particles .",
    "this is very sensitive to the presence of the mesons and when they are not considered there is a dependence on the mass ratio in the low energy regime .",
    "the approach we have followed to the tetraquark system is intended to exhibit the gross features .",
    "certainly , the short distance information and more elaborated interactions should have an effect on the system energy and the corresponding spectrum . in this work ,",
    "we have limited ourselves to the case of identical quarks and identical antiquarks .",
    "different particles effects should be reflected in the high density regime due to the absence of fermi correlations .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath85 eqn .",
    "( [ wkin ] ) is evaluated as follows :    _ meson _ : in this case we have two configurations , corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "let us illustrate the form of the contribution from the coordinate @xmath76 of particle 1 , by taking the derivative of the first element of @xmath86 : @xmath88 thus , if we compute the contribution for the 3 coordinates and add their squares , we get : @xmath89 ^ 2+\\left [ \\partial_{y_1 } q_{m_1 } \\right]^2+\\left [ \\partial_{z_1 } q_{m_1 } \\right]^2 = \\frac{9}{4 } r_{13}\\ ] ] analogous results are obtained for the other particles , adding all them up we get : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the corresponding reduced mass .",
