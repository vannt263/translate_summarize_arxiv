    "this also implies that the fragmentation function is not modified by the medium for the @xmath6 range we measured .",
    "because @xmath0 has four times larger mass compared to that of @xmath9 , one can resolve two photons decaying from @xmath0 up to four times larger @xmath6 of @xmath9 , resulting in a higher @xmath6 reach with smaller systematic errors with @xmath0 .",

    "the constant ratios over the @xmath6 are not trivial at all given several physics processes are involved , and may put additional constraint on dynamical description of the medium .",
