    "semiconductor nanowires have attracted great interest as candidates for nanoelectronic applications and might become a basis for new and high - performance devices on the nanometer scale @xcite .",
    "they enable ultimately scaled conventional fets as well as novel transistor concepts , which are expected to offer superior performence in terms of current drive capability and subthreshold slope @xcite .",
    "moreover , nanowire based transistor devices allow for the investigation of fundamental questions of electronic transport in quasi one - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "a manifold of numerical studies exists that approaches the subject of electronic transport in nwfets using quantum kinetic methods for application - relevant conditions , based on a non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism @xcite",
    ". however , one of the challenges in the realistic simulation of nanodevices consists in the large number of degrees of freedom ( e.g. localized orbitals ) in combination with many - body coulomb interaction effects , which make a full fock - space description numerically unfeasible .",
    "therefore , the majority of nanodevice simulation techniques on realistic length scales are based on a mean - field approximation of the coulomb interaction . in this context , the multi - configurational green s function approach @xcite combines the numerical advantages of a mean - field approximation with a fock - space description of a small sub - set of relevant , resonantly trapped states which are responsible for coulomb charging effects due to individual electrons . in this paper , we analyze the role of these relevant states and the resulting configurations by means of the single - particle - reduced entropy @xcite for the case of a realistic inp based nanowire system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we briefly describe the employed quantum kinetic simulation approach , followed by a definition of the considered nanodevice . then in section [ sec : transport ] , we focus on the electronic transport in the coulomb blockade regime and show signatures of few - electron coulomb charging effects .",
    "section [ sec : entropy ] is devoted to the analysis of the single - particle - reduced entropy of the system .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn .     and",
    "@xmath0 are the gate insulator thickness and the channel diameter , respectively . ]",
    "for our calculations , we have employed a multi - configurational self - consistent green s function ( mcscg ) approach @xcite for a realistic description of discrete resonant states , beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "we make use of a one - band tight - binding description of the channel in the effective mass approximation , represented by a basis of @xmath1 localized 1d single - particle spin orbitals .",
    "the benefit of the mcscg approach stems from the self - consistent division of the channel system into a small subsystem of resonantly trapped ( relevant ) states for which a many - body fock - space treatment becomes numerically feasible , and the rest of the system which is treated adequately on a conventional mean - field level .",
    "the fock - space description allows for the calculation of few - electron coulomb charging effects beyond mean - field , as manifested in the coulomb blockade regime .    in the following",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the single - particle density matrix @xcite of the system under non - equilibrium conditions . for the nwfet channel ,",
    "@xmath2 is a @xmath3 matrix and is obtained from the negf formalism .",
    "the single - particle eigenvectors of @xmath2 are called _ natural orbitals _",
    "@xcite , its eigenvalues are real and within the interval @xmath4 $ ] . for the case of a single slater determinant",
    ", @xmath2 would have only eigenvalues 0 and 1 .",
    "the mcscg approach describes the state of the channel with fluctuating electron number as a weighted mixture of a few relevant many - body states , so - called _",
    "configurations_. in the current approximation , these configurations are assumed to be slater determinants of resonantly trapped natural orbitals @xcite .",
    "the corresponding weights are real , restricted to the @xmath4 $ ] interval , and their sum is unity .",
    "thus , the relevant many - body statistical operator consists of a weighted sum of projectors , restricted in our case to a relevant sub - space of the whole fock - space .",
    "figure [ fig : device ] shows the elements of the considered coaxially - gated nwfet .",
    "the channel consists of an inp nanowire , which has a lattice constant @xmath5 , an electron effective mass @xmath6 and a relative dielectric constant @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we chose a basis with a number of sites @xmath8 giving a length @xmath9 .",
    "its diameter is @xmath10 .",
    "the channel and the gate are separated by a @xmath11 oxide layer of thickness @xmath12 and relative dielectric constant @xmath13 .",
    "the source and drain are contacted with pd / ti to form schottky barriers @xcite of height @xmath14 , which act as double tunnel barriers to confine the electrons in the nanowire .",
    "the same device is used in all the following sections , with a temperature of @xmath15 .",
    "at low enough temperatures and drain  source voltages @xmath16 ( compared to the channel s coulomb charging energy and single - particle energy level spacing ) , the energy which is necessary to add an extra electron to the channel can exceed the thermal energy , and the current through the nwfet is blocked . within this coulomb blockade regime , the nwfet behaves as a single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite .",
    "we have simulated electronic transport in this regime by means of the mcscg approach .",
    "coulomb diamonds emerge in the current  voltage characteristics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds ] . in these regions ,",
    "the drain current @xmath17 reduces to almost zero by coulomb blockade and the channel is occupied by an integer number of electrons @xmath18 . along the @xmath19 axis ,",
    "drain current can flow where the electron number within the channel fluctuates between @xmath18 and @xmath20 . by varying the gate ",

    "the single - particle - reduced entropy in bit is defined as @xcite @xmath22 in quantum chemistry , @xmath23 is referred to as the _ correlation entropy _",
    "@xcite for pure many - body states . in general",
    ", @xmath23 indicates the deviation from a single slater determinant , due to correlation and/or mixture .",
    "expanded in terms of the natural orbital basis , @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath2 . in this paper ,",
    "the nwfet channel is described by a mixture of a few relevant slater determinants with detailed coulomb interaction , whereas the `` non - relevant '' rest is treated on a mean - field level .",
    "then , @xmath23 measures the degree of mixture of the system s preparation .    in the extreme case of a many - body preparation that is a mixture of slater determinants with a set of fully disjoint single - particle states ( i.e. , with complementary occupation ) , @xmath26 can be interpreted as the number of relevant slater determinants in the preparation @xcite , where @xmath27 denotes the number of _ fluctuating _ electrons .",
    "for example , point b in table  [ tab : data ] corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : diamonds_and_entropy ] shows the simulated characteristics which clearly exhibit a correspondence between the coulomb diamonds in the current  voltage characteristics and certain diamond - like shaped structures in the entropy diagram . for those regions where the current is blocked and the channel occupied by @xmath29 electrons ( coulomb diamonds from left to right ) the state of the device jumps consecutively from open shell ( @xmath30 and multiple slater determinants ) to closed shell ( @xmath31 and a single slater determinant ) .",
    "@xmath23 indeed reflects these mixtures and therefore its geometry is also diamond - shaped .",
    "this will be seen in detail in the following .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] gathers information obtained by means of the mcscg formalism , corresponding to different voltage points in fig .",
    "[ fig : diamonds_and_entropy ] . point a is associated with an empty channel ( @xmath32 ) , whose state is given by the vacuum state with unity weight .",
    "@xmath33 in this case , indicating that the degree of mixture of the preparation is minimum .",
    "point b corresponds to the first diamond ( @xmath34 ) . here , the single electron in the channel ( @xmath28 ) has the chance to occupy one of the two states in the first single - particle energy level : with spin up or with spin down ( open shell configuration ) .",
    "this is reflected in the two slater determinants ( @xmath35 ) with almost equal weights @xmath36 that describe the state of the system .",
    "@xmath37 and therefore the degree of mixture is higher than in the empty channel case .",
    "a non - equilibrium state is described in point c by three slater determinants with similar weights @xmath38 .",
    "this situation shows that it is equally probable in this state to find an electron in the first single - particle energy level with spin up or down , or two electrons with both spin directions .",
    "point d corresponds to the second diamond ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "each electron occupies the first single - particle energy level with spin up and down respectively ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , there is only one slater determinant to describe this situation and so its weight is unity . @xmath33 as in the case of an empty channel .",
    "again , the degree of mixture is minimum .",
    "finally , point e shows the case of the third diamond ( @xmath41 ) , very similar to that of the first diamond . here",
    ", two electrons occupy the first single - particle energy level , and a third one ( @xmath28 ) has both possibilities of spin occupation in the second single - particle energy level .",
    "although there is a small contribution from a doubly occupied slater determinant , we can see that @xmath35 , and the last two determinants are the main contributors ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath23 is slightly higher than one reflects that the first determinant also plays a minor role .     and single - particle - reduced entropy @xmath44 as a function of @xmath21 for fixed @xmath45 . ]",
    "all of the near - equilibrium cases corresponding to coulomb diamonds that we have analyzed can be summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : enumber_entropy ] , in which @xmath18 and @xmath23 are plotted against @xmath21 for fixed @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath18 curve exhibits integer charging steps . on the other hand , @xmath23 oscillates approximately between zero and one .",
    "it can be seen here that @xmath33 for @xmath46 , corresponding to an empty channel and the second coulomb diamond ( closed shell configuration ) respectively , described by only one slater determinant , as shown in table  [ tab : data ] . whereas @xmath37 for @xmath47 , corresponding to the first and third diamonds ( open shell configurations ) with more than one slater determinant .",
    "one has to note that the rest of the system ( outside the relevant fock sub - space ) also contributes to @xmath23 , leading to slightly increased values .",
    "we have simulated quantum transport properties of a realistic gated nanowire system in the coulomb blockade regime by means of a multi - configurational green s function approach .",
    "the current  voltage characteristics correctly resemble the experimentally known signatures of few - electron coulomb charging effects .",
    "in addition , the single - particle - reduced entropy has been analyzed for several channel states , showing that it is a measure of the mixture in the system s thermodynamical preparation . in this sense",
    ", @xmath23 can be interpreted as the lack of information about the slater determinant in which the system can be found .",
