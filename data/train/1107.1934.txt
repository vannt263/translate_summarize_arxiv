    "quantum internet is important for quantum computation , communication and metrology @xcite . the main methods to realize the quantum networks are the cavity - qed - based protocol @xcite and the protocol provided by duan , lukin , cirac , and zoller ( dlcz ) @xcite .",
    "the former one uses the interaction between light and @xmath0-type three - level atoms in a high - q cavity to store quantum states @xcite .",
    "the latter one involves the measurement - induced entanglement @xcite , replaces single atoms by atomic ensembles so that it reduces the restriction of the cavity s quality and utilize the built - in entanglement - purification to create the long - distance quantum communication efficiently .",
    "thus it is of great significance to consider the interaction between few photons and a cavity - coupled emitter .",
    "here we focus on a unique one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide for photons because it is helpful to realize the strong photon - photon interaction @xcite .",
    "recently , people have already done some researches about the interaction between light and an atom - cavity system in a 1d waveguide both in experiment @xcite and in theory @xcite .",
    "these theoretical approaches include either scattering matrix @xcite or quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the two methods get the similar results for single photons @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the interaction of two photons and a cavity - coupled two - level emitter in a 1d waveguide . by analyzing two - photon wave packets , generalizing the scattering matrix @xcite to dispose frequency - spectrum transformation",
    ", we get the two - photon correlated momenta distribution , correlated transmitted coefficient , fano resonance line shape and other important properties . comparing with most existing works ,",

    "however , we find that if each one of the two photons runs out of the cavity , it can not form the situation that two photons are at together again .",
