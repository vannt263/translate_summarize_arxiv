    "the radio emission from quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) has puzzled astronomers for nearly 50 years .",
    "the first qsos to be recognized contain very strong radio sources similar to those powered by the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of the most luminous radio galaxies , but @xmath13% of bright optically selected qsos are fainter than 1  mjy at 1.4  ghz . also , the flux - density distribution of radio - loud qsos is quite different from that of radio galaxies , and might even be bimodal .",
    "these differences led to longstanding debates about whether qsos experience the same cosmological evolution as radio galaxies and whether there are two distinct types of radio sources in qsos . in this paper , we use direct detections of radio sources stronger than 2.4  mjy and statistical detections of fainter sources in two large samples of qsos to argue that ( 1 ) radio - loud qsos are similar to powerful radio galaxies and do evolve , despite their differing flux - density distributions , and ( 2 ) radio - quiet qsos really are different from radio - loud qsos because most of their radio emission is powered by starbursts instead of agns .",
    "since the problem of radio emission from qsos has such a long and complicated history , we begin with a short review to set the stage and define common terms .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found the first quasi - stellar radio sources ( quasars or qsss ) by optically identifying redshifted `` stars '' with radio sources whose luminosities are `` not markedly different from other known strong radio sources like cygnus a or 3c 295 '' @xcite in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the first optically selected quasi - stellar galaxies ( qsgs ) found by @xcite `` resemble the quasi - stellar radio sources in many optical properties , but they are radio quiet '' in the sense that only about one qsg per thousand brighter than @xmath14 appeared in the relatively insensitive all - sky radio catalogs of the time ( @xmath15  jy at 178 mhz ) .",
    "all of the first quasars and qsgs appear starlike because their agns are far more luminous than their inferred host galaxies , assuming their redshifts are cosmological .",
    "the deliberately vague name `` quasi - stellar object '' ( qso ) still used today for both quasars and qsgs was introduced by @xcite because they doubted the redshifts of the qsgs were cosmological and so `` at this stage we do not think enough is known about their nature for a definitive name to be chosen . ''",
    "although qsgs were called `` a major new constituent of the universe '' by @xcite , they are not a distinct constituent , only the luminous tail of a continuous distribution that includes seyfert galaxies whose agns do not overwhelm their starlight .",
    "@xcite formally distinguished them from seyfert galaxies by requiring qsos contain agns brighter than @xmath16 , the absolute magnitude of the brightest galaxies of stars calculated using @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in the modern flat @xmath19cdm cosmology with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the brightest galaxies have @xmath22 , so the spirit of the @xcite criterion ( qsos contain agns brighter than any host galaxy of stars ) would change the qso cutoff to @xmath22 . however , like most authors , we follow the letter ( @xmath23 ) of the @xcite criterion . thus our least - luminous qsos are actually about twice as luminous as the brightest galaxies .",
    "the value of this cutoff matters because such luminous qsos are rarely found in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cumulative radio flux - density distribution of the strongest radio galaxies rises slightly faster than the euclidean rate @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cumulative number of sources per steradian stronger than @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the differential number per steradian with flux densities @xmath26 to @xmath28 .",
    "if the same were true of bright qsos and there is one radio - loud qso stronger than 10  jy among 1000 optically selected qsos , one might hope to find 30 radio sources stronger than 1 jy and hundreds above 0.1 jy . from this perspective , the first directed searches for radio emission from optically selected qsos were surprisingly unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "radio sources were detected in only about 10% of bright qsos even after decades of increasingly sensitive searches @xcite for sources as faint as 0.01 jy at @xmath29 , or @xmath30\\approx 24 $ ] at @xmath31 .",
    "these low detection rates imply that the flux - density distribution of optically selected qsos rises much more slowly and may even be bimodal . they might also indicate that qsos and radio galaxies do not experience the same amount of cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to report a bimodal qso flux - density distribution , with an observed peak near @xmath32 and an inferred peak at @xmath33 , albeit in a very small sample .",
    "@xcite noted a bimodal luminosity distribution implied by the bimodal flux - density distribution of their larger sample of qsos in the redshift range @xmath3 .",
    "they found nine radio sources with @xmath34 spectral luminosities @xmath30 > 26 $ ] , 96 upper limits below @xmath30 \\approx 25 $ ] , and nothing in between . the term `` bimodal '' is perhaps too strong : a bimodal distribution has two peaks .",
    "neither @xcite or @xcite actually detected the low - luminosity peak ; its existence was only inferred from the large number of nondetections whose radio flux densities or luminosities would have to be spread smoothly over many orders of magnitude to not yield a second peak .",
    "for a recent analysis of bimodality in light of modern optical and radio data , see @xcite .    a bimodal flux - density or luminosity distribution suggests there may be two distinct populations of radio sources in qsos . for example",
    ", @xcite associated their high - luminosity peak with agns in elliptical galaxies similar to the hosts of radio galaxies and the inferred low - luminosity peak with weaker agns in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , _ any _ nonuniformity or feature in these distributions is sufficient to suggest two distinct populations .",
    "bimodality is sufficient but not necessary , so we suggest that debates about whether a clearly visible feature in a distribution makes it truly bimodal are not relevant to the fundamental question `` are there two distinct populations of qsos ? ''",
    "three factors have complicated investigations of qso radio luminosity functions :    \\(1 ) the radio / optical luminosity ratio of qsos might be a better measure of radio loudness than absolute radio luminosity alone .",
    "@xcite proposed that the radio luminosity function `` depends on the optical luminosity in such a manner that the ratio has a universal distribution function '' of the form @xmath35 equation  [ req ] implies a linear correlation between radio and optical luminosities , so the radio / optical ratio @xmath36 may be a better indicator of radio activity .",
    "@xcite countered that almost no radio - loud qsos are optically fainter than @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 and @xmath18 , equivalent to @xmath39 for today s @xmath19cdm model ) , so that an apparent correlation in the data may only reflect differences between two populations of qso host galaxies , optically luminous ellipticals and optically fainter spirals . using first @xcite direct and statistical detections of qsos in a very large sample",
    ", @xcite found a clear but nonlinear correlation of radio and optical luminosities @xmath40 .",
    "however , appendix c of @xcite argues that selection effects are responsible for such apparent correlations .",
    "\\(2 ) flux - density boosting in relativistic [ @xmath41 radio jets may significantly broaden both the radio flux - density and the @xmath42 distributions of qsos , whose optical emission does not appear to be strongly beamed @xcite .",
    "thus radio jets in optically selected qsos should be randomly oriented relative to our line - of - sight , but only the small fraction @xmath43 of qsos whose jets are aligned near our line - of - sight become radio - loud quasars . the geometry of relativistic beaming tends to flatten the differential count of qso radio sources from @xmath44 towards @xmath45 [ or @xmath46 for intrinsically steep - spectrum ( @xmath47 ) sources .",
    "\\(3 ) like the optical emission from a qso , the radio emission is the sum of two known components , one powered by the agn and the other by the host galaxy of stars .",
    "massive stars born within the past @xmath48 years and relativistic electrons accelerated by their supernova remnants power the radio emission from the host galaxy , so a `` red and dead '' elliptical galaxy with no recent star formation can be extremely radio - quiet @xcite . a number of features can be used to distinguish between these two types of radio source .",
    "the most powerful nearby starburst is in the ultraluminous infrared galaxy arp 220 , whose spectral luminosity is @xmath49 \\approx 23.5 $ ] .",
    "although the western nucleus of arp 220 appears to contain an obscured agn with x - ray luminosity @xmath50 @xcite , the compact radio component in the western nucleus accounts for less than 25% of the integrated 1.4  ghz radio flux density @xcite , so the arp 220 starburst luminosity is not less than @xmath51 \\approx 23.4 $ ] . a starburst - powered radio source is roughly coextensive with the starburst and is not brighter than @xmath52  k at 1.4  ghz , has the steep spectrum @xmath53 at centimeter wavelengths typical of optically thin synchrotron radiation , obeys the far - infrared ( fir)/radio correlation @xcite , and is not strongly variable .",
    "in contrast , an agn can produce a radio source several orders of magnitude more luminous than @xmath54\\sim 24 $ ] , its radio jets and lobes can extend far outside the host galaxy of stars , and its radio core can be small enough to vary significantly on time scales of years @xcite .",
    "the radio spectrum of an agn can be nearly flat ( @xmath55 ) over a wide frequency range , either from a synchrotron self - absorption `` conspiracy '' among compact components @xcite or from optically thin free - free radiation by a hot @xmath56 agn disk wind @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that `` for 20 out of 22 pg quasars studied , free - free emission from a wind emanating from the accretion disc can not mutually explain the observed radio and x - ray luminosity , '' eliminating free - free emission as the cause of the radio - quiet peak in the luminosity distribution of qsos .",
    "nearly all low - redshift ( @xmath57 ) radio galaxies seem to be `` red and dead '' ellipticals whose radio sources are powered primarily by their agns . by analogy ,",
    "low - redshift qsos whose radio sources are ( 1 ) more luminous than @xmath51\\sim 24 $ ] , ( 2 ) have lower fir / radio flux - density ratios than starburst galaxies , ( 3 ) are either larger than @xmath58 or very compact @xcite , ( 4 ) are strongly variable @xcite or ( 5 ) have flat radio spectra probably reside in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this analogy is supported by high - resolution _ hst _ images of nearby qso host galaxies @xcite .",
    "qsos close to the original @xcite luminosity limit often obey the fir / radio correlation , may contain starburst - dominated radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may be in disc or merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that qsos having nuclear luminosities @xmath59 ( assuming @xmath60 , or @xmath61 in modern @xmath19cdm cosmology ) are virtually all massive ellipticals with no large - scale star formation .",
    "weak radio emission correlated with the strength of the 4000    break indicates that star formation is quite common in the host galaxies of low - luminosity agns @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the radio properties of qso samples are likely to depend on the absolute magnitude cutoff , and samples containing low - luminosity agns should not be used to infer the radio properties of true qsos",
    ".    the 1.4 ghz flux density of an ultraluminous starburst galaxy like arp 220 would be only @xmath62 at @xmath63 and @xmath64 at @xmath65 , so exceptionally sensitive observations are needed to characterize the starburst radio emission from individual qso host galaxies .",
    "@xcite detected most of the low - redshift ( @xmath57 ) palomar bright quasar survey ( pbqs ) qsos at 5  ghz and found a bimodal spectral luminosity _ distribution _ ( not _ function _ ) peaking at @xmath66 \\sim 26 $ ] and @xmath67 .",
    "the low - luminosity peak for qsos spans the range @xmath68 with a median @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite used high - resolution radio images and [ o  iii ] spectra of the pbqs qsos as evidence for a circumnuclear starburst contribution to the low - luminosity peak .",
    "recent results from significantly more sensitive karl  g.  jansky very large array ( vla ) observations of 179 sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) qsos in the redshift range @xmath70 found a low - luminosity peak @xcite centered on @xmath71 and @xmath72 at @xmath73  ghz .",
    "the radio sources contributing to this peak have a median spectral index @xmath74 consistent with starburst radio emission .",
    "unfortunately their median flux densities are only @xmath75  mjy at 6  ghz and @xmath76  mjy at 1.4  ghz , so making follow - up observations will be difficult .",
    "the @xcite radio luminosity function suggests that most radio sources with @xmath77 > 23 $ ] at 6  ghz ( or @xmath78 at 1.4  ghz ) in low - redshift qsos are powered primarily by agns , not starbursts .",
    "@xcite reobserved `` radio quiet '' qsos and low - luminosity agns from their bqs sample @xcite at 5  ghz with @xmath79 and @xmath80 resolution and resolved a number of compact cores and extended lobes similar to those in radio - loud quasars , suggesting that central engines exist in galaxies and quasars over a wide range of radio luminosity .",
    "they noted , however , that their resolved `` radio quiet '' qsos had radio luminosities well in excess of that expected from the underlying galaxy .",
    "several high - resolution radio observations have demonstrated that most mjy - level radio sources in qsos contain radio components so compact that they must be agn - powered .",
    "three flat - spectrum ( @xmath81 ) `` radio intermediate '' ( defined by @xmath82 at @xmath83 ghz ) qsos were found to have brightness temperatures @xmath84  k @xcite , much too high for starburst radio emission .",

    "however , four of the `` quasars '' are low - luminosity agns with @xmath88 ( mrk 335 , iii zw 2 , mrk 705 , and ii zw 171 ) .",
    "five of the eight true qsos were detected by the vlba , but all five have radio luminosities in the range @xmath89 $ ] high enough that we expect a significant agn contribution .",
    "@xcite considered a sample of 11 `` radio - quiet quasars '' having total 5 ghz flux densities of 4 mjy or greater .",

    "we believe their conclusion `` thus , the most likely explanation for their radio properties is simply the radio - quiet quasars are similar to their traditional radio - loud cousins but have less powerful radio jets . ''",
    "@xcite applies only to qsos containing radio sources stronger than starbursts produce .",
    "we conclude that , unfortunately , vlb observations are simply not sensitive enough ( @xmath94 ) to address the question of starburst radio emission in large samples of radio - quiet quasars .    finally , @xcite compared radio variability in samples of radio - quiet ( defined by having @xmath95 ) , radio - intermediate , and radio - loud quasars .",
    "they found that radio variability is independent of radio loudness .",
    "of the 11 `` radio - quiet quasars '' monitored , four are low - luminosity agns ( mrk 335 , mrk 1148 , ugc 11763 , and pgc 070504 ) .",
    "four of the seven true qsos are variable radio sources and three are not . among the variable qsos ,",
    "only pg 0052 + 251 at @xmath96 is sufficiently radio quiet ( @xmath97 = 22.6 $ ] and @xmath98 ) that a starburst might have contributed significantly to its radio emission .",
    "this single source is consistent with the 6 ghz radio luminosity functions shown in figure 6 of @xcite , which suggests that about one in four qso radio sources with @xmath77 = 22.6 $ ] should be agn - dominated .",
    "we believe their conclusion `` ... the radio emission from radio - quiet quasars originates in a compact structure intimately associated with the active nucleus .",
    "the alternative hypothesis , that the emission from radio - weak quasars is from a starburst , is ruled out . ''",
    "@xcite has been justified only for radio sources stronger than @xmath99 \\sim 24 $ ] and @xmath100 in qsos , not for the weaker radio sources expected from starbursts .",
    "qsos have such broad radio luminosity functions that their radio emission can be characterized only via large unbiased samples of radio - detected qsos .",
    "sensitive directed searches for radio emission from qsos have been impeded by the small numbers of radio detections .",
    "a typical vla observing program might target @xmath101 qsos .",
    "detecting statistically useful numbers @xmath102 of radio sources requires either a detection rate near 100% or a much larger qso sample if the detection rate is low ( e.g. , @xmath103 if the detection rate is only @xmath104% ) .",
    "furthermore , nearby qsos in which starburst - powered radio sources can be detected individually have such a low sky surface density that a statistically useful sample can be obtained only from an optical survey covering more than a steradian with uniformly accurate multicolor photometry .",
    "the sdss dr7 ( data release 7 ) qso sample @xcite covers @xmath105 sr at galactic latitudes @xmath106 and satisfies that requirement .",
    "this paper is based on nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) @xcite 1.4 ghz flux densities of ( 1 ) a volume - limited sample of 1313 dr7 qsos with @xmath1 ( sec .",
    "[ lowzsec ] ) and ( 2 ) a magnitude - limited sample of 2471 dr7 qsos in the redshift range @xmath107 ( sec .",
    "[ hizsec ] ) .    above the nvss catalog limit @xmath108  mjy  beam@xmath109 ,",
    "the detection rate in each sample is only about 10% , but the qso samples are large enough to yield hundreds of nvss detections .",
    "in addition , most of the remaining qsos can be detected statistically on the nvss images at levels @xmath110  mjy  beam@xmath109 .",
    "the main result of the direct detections is that the differential luminosity function @xmath111 of strong radio sources powered by the agns in qsos is an extremely flat power law , so flat that extrapolating to lower luminosities predicts essentially no statistical detections at the @xmath112  mjy level .",
    "our high statistical detection rate implies a `` bump '' in the radio luminosity function of qsos in the range @xmath113 \\sim 23 $ ] to 24 , depending on redshift .",
    "we attribute this bump to radio emission powered by luminous starbursts in the host galaxies of _ most _ bright qsos ( sec .",
    "[ qsolumfsec ] ) .",
    "the sdss dr7 qso catalog @xcite is complete to @xmath114 over a solid angle @xmath115 around the north galactic pole .",
    "it contains the small sample of 179 color - selected qsos defined by @xmath116 in the narrow redshift range @xmath117 studied by @xcite and the larger sample of 1313 qsos in the wider redshift range @xmath1 discussed here .",
    "note that these magnitudes were calculated for an @xmath118 @xmath19cdm cosmology , so our qso cutoff corresponds to @xmath119 for comparison with @xcite and should discriminate against the low - luminosity qsos that can appear in spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "both samples are strictly volume limited because any @xmath116 qso with @xmath120 is brighter than @xmath121 .",
    "there are no more color - selected qsos with @xmath1 to be found in that 21% of the sky , so no observation made at this time and place in the universe can reduce our statistical errors by more than about a factor of two  our sample variance is approaching the `` cosmic variance '' limit set by the finite observable volume of the universe @xcite .",
    "the entire dr7 area is covered by the nvss , whose source catalog is complete for statistical purposes above a peak flux density @xmath122 at 1.4 ghz . in the redshift range",
    "@xmath1 the 45  arcsec fwhm ( full width between half - maximum points ) beam of the nvss spans 150 to 250 kpc , more than enough to cover the host galaxy of stars and most of the extended radio emission powered by an agn .",
    "consequently the nvss sees most qsos as point sources and the nvss integrated flux - density limit is @xmath123 . for radio sources with spectral index @xmath124 , the corresponding @xmath125  ghz ( in the source frame )",
    "nvss spectral - luminosity detection limits range from @xmath126 = 23.4 $ ] at @xmath127 to @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",
    "thus most of these sources are too luminous to be powered primarily by starbursts .    to ensure completeness even for radio sources larger than the nvss beam , we examined all nvss catalog entries within 120 arcsec of each qso .",
    "we rejected components centered more than a few arcsec from the optical position unless their morphologies in the nvss and/or higher - resolution ( 5.4  arcsec fwhm ) first @xcite images plausibly link them with the qso .",
    "unresolved or symmetric nvss sources are easily identified with qsos by radio - optical position coincidence alone , but asymmetric multicomponent sources can be difficult .",
    "for example , the left panel of figure  [ 0912idfig ] shows two marginally resolved nvss components whose centers straddle the optical position ( cross ) of sdss j091205.16 + 543141.2 .",
    "two lobes and a core are clearly resolved in the first image ( right panel ) , confirming the otherwise uncertain nvss identification . because the nvss has low resolution , it has high surface - brightness sensitivity .",
    "the two nvss components contain essentially all of the qso flux density , 23.8 mjy , while the three first components add up to only 6.6 mjy .",
    "this example illustrates how the nvss and first complement each other for identifying extended radio sources and measuring their flux densities .",
    "we also found that the first peak flux densities of qsos fainter than @xmath130 are usually close to the nvss flux densities , and very few faint nvss sources are not in the first catalog .",
    "this indicates that most of the fainter radio sources produced by these qsos have half - power linear sizes @xmath131 and the likelihood that the nvss has resolved out any faint sources is small .",
    "unfortunately , radio sources powered by starbursts and and by low - luminosity jets from agns are both consistent with this size limit ; sub - arcsecond resolution is needed to distinguish between them @xcite .",
    "first probably does not resolve out many sources in the @xmath132 range either , but we have not included the first flux densities for these sources in our statistical analysis because they are systematically low by about 0.25  mjy owing to `` snapshot '' bias @xcite . also the first source count @xcite indicates a rapid fall in differential completeness below @xmath133  mjy . although the nvss image noise is higher , the snapshot bias is lower , so we chose to study all sources fainter 2.4  mjy statistically via their amplitude distribution on nvss images ( see section  [ pofdsubsec ] for a complete discussion of snapshot bias in first and nvss ) instead .",
    "a number of stronger sources are clearly resolved by the nvss , but most have brightnesses well above the @xmath134 nvss catalog limit .",
    "thus the nvss integrated flux densities of radio - loud qsos should be accurate and the nvss should not have missed any radio - loud qsos .",
    "there are 163 nvss detections with @xmath1 ( table  [ nvsstable ] ) , of which only 37 are in the narrow redshift range @xmath70 that was also covered by our more sensitive directed vla observations at 6 ghz @xcite .",

    "<S> we used the 1.4 ghz nvss to study radio sources in two color - selected qso samples : a volume - limited sample of 1313 qsos defined by @xmath0 in the redshift range @xmath1 and a magnitude - limited sample of 2471 qsos with @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> about 10% were detected above the 2.4 mjy nvss catalog limit and are powered primarily by agns . </S>",

    "<S> both redshift ranges the flux - density distributions and luminosity functions of qsos stronger than 2.4 mjy are power laws , with no features to suggest more than one kind of radio source . extrapolating the power laws to lower luminosities predicts the remaining qsos should be extremely radio quiet , but they are not . </S>",

    "<S> we suggest that the faint radio sources are powered by star formation at rates @xmath8 in the moderate luminosity ( median @xmath9 ) low - redshift qsos and @xmath10 in the very luminous ( @xmath11 ) high - redshift qsos </S>",
    "<S> . such luminous starbursts [ @xmath12 and 12.6 , respectively ] are consistent with `` quasar mode '' accretion in which cold gas flows fuel both agn and starburst . </S>"
