    "the galaxy classification scheme of @xcite has proved durably useful . as modified and extended by @xcite , it is still the standard method for classifying low - redshift galaxies with high surface brightness .",
    "the hubble classification scheme was originally based on the appearance of galaxies on photographic plates .",
    "elliptical galaxies have smooth elliptical isophotes ; spiral galaxies have spiral arms that wind outward from a central bulge or bar .",
    "it was later discovered that for luminous galaxies , the surface brightness profile is strongly correlated with the hubble type .",
    "if the surface brightness @xmath16 is measured along the major axis of a galaxy s image , it is found that bright elliptical galaxies have surface brightness profiles that are well fit by a de vaucouleurs , or @xmath17 law , for which @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile of a spiral galaxy , outside its central bulge , is typically well fit by an exponential law , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it was also eventually realized that galaxies of different hubble type have different kinematic properties .",
    "the disks of spiral galaxies are rotationally flattened , with stars and gas on nearly circular orbits with little random motion .",
    "bright elliptical galaxies ( @xmath20 ) , by contrast , are slowly rotating and are supported mainly by their anisotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "one shortcoming of the hubble classification scheme , imposed by necessity , is that elliptical galaxies are classified by their apparent two - dimensional shape , seen in projection on the sky , rather than their intrinsic three - dimensional shape .",
    "consider an idealized galaxy whose surfaces of constant luminosity density are concentric , coaxial , similar ellipsoids , with principal axes of lengths @xmath21 ; the shape of the galaxy can then be described by the two axis ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "equivalently , the shape can be described by the two numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where the triaxiality parameter @xmath9 is given by the relation @xmath24 .",
    "if the ellipsoidal galaxy is seen in projection , though , its isophotes will be concentric , coaxial , similar ellipses .",
    "the shape of the projected image can then be described by the single axis ratio @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the major and minor axis length of any isophote .",
    "although knowing the apparent axis ratio @xmath28 is not , by itself , sufficient to determine the intrinsic axis ratios @xmath29 and @xmath8 , the three - dimensional shape of galaxies is not beyond all conjecture .",
    "two approaches to determining the three - dimensional shape of galaxies have been used .",
    "first , the intrinsic shape of an individual galaxy can be modeled if kinematic data are available in addition to photometric data @xcite .",
    "however , accurate galaxy modeling requires either multiple long - slit position angles @xcite or integral - field spectroscopy @xcite , and is best applied to systems with high surface brightness and large angular size .",
    "the second approach , which can be used in the absence of kinematic information , is to make statistical estimates of the distribution of @xmath29 and @xmath8 for a large sample of galaxies .",
    "early estimates of the intrinsic shape distribution made the assumption that elliptical galaxies were oblate spheroids , with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "more recent studies , using accurate surface photometry , reveal that the distribution of apparent shapes for ellipticals can not be explained by a population of randomly oriented oblate spheroids ; it can easily be explained , however , by a population of triaxial ellipsoids @xcite .    in this paper , we use the photometry - only approach to constraining the intrinsic shapes of galaxies , using the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss dr3 ) as our source of galaxy photometry .",
    "previous studies using the sdss early data release and data release 1 studied the axis ratios of galaxies best fit by de vaucouleurs profiles @xcite and those best fit by exponential profiles @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we more closely examine the relation between surface brightness profile and intrinsic shape .",
    "in addition , we determine , for each profile type , the dependence of intrinsic shape on galaxy luminosity . for elliptical galaxies , the distribution of apparent shapes is known to depend on absolute magnitude .",
    "elliptical galaxies with @xmath20 are rounder on average than fainter ellipticals @xcite ; for a typical elliptical galaxy color of @xmath31 @xcite , the dividing luminosity corresponds to @xmath32 . in this paper ,",
    "given the large sample size provided by the sdss dr3 , we can look for a similar shape dichotomy not only among galaxies with de vaucouleurs profiles , but among galaxies with a variety of surface brightness profile types .    in  [ sec - data ] of this paper",
    ", we describe the sdss and the methods by which we determine the apparent axis ratio of the galaxies in our sample . in ",
    "[ sec - app ] , we examine how the apparent axis ratios depend on the galaxy profile type and the galaxy luminosity , then use nonparametric kernel estimators to determine the distribution of apparent axis ratios for different samples of galaxies , subdivided by luminosity and profile type . in ",
    "[ sec - int ] , we invert the distribution of apparent axis ratios to find the distribution of intrinsic axis ratios , assuming galaxies all have the same trixiality parameter @xmath9 . in addition to looking at purely oblate galaxies ( @xmath33 ) and purely prolate galaxies ( @xmath14 ) , we also examine the results for triaxial galaxies with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in  [ sec - dis ] , we discuss the implications of the observed galaxy shapes for different scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite will , when complete , provide a map of nearly one - fourth of the celestial sphere . a ccd mosaic",
    "camera @xcite images the sky in five photometric bands ( @xmath38 ; @xcite )",
    ". the main galaxy sample ( mgs ) of the sdss @xcite will eventually contain @xmath39 galaxies with @xmath40 ; the mean redshift of galaxies in the mgs is @xmath41 , determined from a follow - up spectroscopic survey .",
    "the sdss data release 3 , issued to the astronomical community in 2004 october , contains 5282 square degrees of imaging data and 4188 square degrees of spectroscopic data ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss dr3 data processing pipeline provides a morphological star / galaxy separation , with extended objects being classified as ` galaxies ' and point - like objects being classified as ` stars ' . for each galaxy , in each photometric band , a pair of models are fitted to the two - dimensional galaxy image .",
    "the first model has a de vaucouleurs surface profile @xcite : @xmath42 \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] truncated beyond @xmath43 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath44 .",
    "the second model has an exponential profile : @xmath45 \\right ) \\ , \\ ] ] truncated beyond @xmath46 to go smoothly to zero at @xmath47 . for each model , the apparent axis ratio @xmath48 and the phase angle @xmath49",
    "are assumed to be constant with radius .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are varied to give the best @xmath52 fit to the galaxy image , after convolution with a double - gaussian fit to the point spread function .",
    "the sdss dr3 pipeline also takes the best - fit exponential model and the best - fit de vaucouleurs model and finds the linear combination of the two that best fits the galaxy image .",
    "the fraction of the total flux contributed by the de vaucouleurs component is the parameter ` fracdev ` , which is constrained to lie in the interval @xmath53 .",
    "the ` fracdev ` parameter delineates a continuum of surface brightness profile types , from the pure de vaucouleurs ( @xmath1 ) to the pure exponential ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the sdss dr3 databases provide many different measures of the apparent axis ratio @xmath28 of each galaxy in each of the five photometric bands . in this paper",
    ", we will use the @xmath0 band data , at an effective wavelength of 6165 .",
    "( we also repeated our analysis at @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the other two bands with high signal - to - noise , and did not find significantly different results from our @xmath0 band analysis . ) two measures of the apparent axis ratio are given by the best - fitting axis ratios @xmath48 for the de vaucouleurs and exponential models .",
    "however , the algorithm for fitting the models introduces quantization in the distribution of @xmath48 .",
    "because of this artificial quantization , we do not use the model axis ratios as estimates of the true apparent shapes of galaxies .",
    "a useful measure of the apparent shape in the outer regions of galaxies is the axis ratio of the 25 mag arcsec@xmath56 isophote .",
    "the sdss dr3 data pipeline finds the best fitting ellipse to the 25 mag arcsec@xmath56 isophote in each band ; the semimajor axis and semiminor axis of this isophotal ellipse are @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the isophotal axis ratio @xmath59 then provides a measure of the apparent galaxy shape at a few times the effective radius . for galaxies in our sample with @xmath1 ,",
    "the mean and standard deviation of @xmath60 are @xmath61 ; for galaxies with @xmath62 , the mean and standard deviation are @xmath63 .",
    "another measure of the apparent shape is @xmath3 , the axis ratio determined by the use of adaptive moments of the galaxy s light .",
    "the method of adaptive moments determines the @xmath64th order moments of a galaxy image , using an elliptical weight function whose shape matches that of the image @xcite . the sdss dr3 adaptive moments use a weight function @xmath65 that is a gaussian matched to the size and ellipticity of the galaxy image @xmath66 . the adaptive first order moments , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "tell us the ` center of light ' of the galaxy s image . with this knowledge , we can compute the adaptive second order moments : @xmath69 and so forth .",
    "the sdss dr3 provides for each image the values of the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the adaptive second moments can be converted into an axis ratio using the relation @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "the adaptive moments axis ratio @xmath3 , computed in the manner given above , is not corrected for the effects of seeing .",
    "the sdss dr3 also provides the fourth order adaptive moments of the galaxy image , and the adaptive moments @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 of the point spread function at the galaxy s location .",
    "these moments can be used to correct for the smearing and shearing due to seeing ; such corrections are essential for studying the small shape changes resulting from weak lensing @xcite . however , in this paper we will only look at well - resolved galaxies for which the seeing corrections are negligibly small .",
    "our full sample of galaxies consists of those objects in the sdss dr3 spectroscopic sample which are flagged as galaxies and which have spectroscopic redshifts @xmath78 ( to eliminate contaminating foreground objects ) and @xmath79 ( to reduce the possibility of weak lensing significantly distorting the observed shape ) . to ensure that galaxies were well resolved",
    ", we also required @xmath80 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath81 of each galaxy was computed from the petrosian @xmath0 magnitude and the spectroscopic redshift , assuming a hubble constant @xmath82 in a flat universe with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "no k - correction was applied to the data ; for galaxies with normal colors at low redshift the k - correction in the @xmath0 band is small  less than 0.2 mag for an average elliptical galaxy at @xmath85 , and even less for galaxies at smaller redshifts or with bluer colors @xcite .",
    "the total number of galaxies in our full sample , selected in this way , is @xmath86 .",
    "of the full sample , only 919 galaxies have @xmath1 , and 26,994 have @xmath2 .",
    "the remainder , constituting 71% of the full sample , are best fit by a combination of a de vaucouleurs and exponential model , with @xmath87 .",
    "it remains to be demonstrated that ` fracdev ` is a useful parameter for describing the surface brightness profile type of galaxies .",
    "after all , a linear combination of the best de vaucouleurs fit and the best exponential fit will not , in general , be the best possible de vaucouleurs plus exponential fit .",
    "an alternative method of describing surface brightness profiles is by fitting a srsic profile @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath64 can be an arbitrary number .",
    "this fitting method was used , for instance , by @xcite in their study of sdss galaxies .",
    "if , in fact , galaxies are well described by srsic profiles , then ` fracdev ` is a useful surrogate for the srsic index @xmath64 .",
    "consider , for instance , a galaxy whose surface brightness is perfectly described by a srsic profile of index @xmath89 and effective radius @xmath90 .",
    "the best - fitting exponential model for this galaxy ( fitting in the radial region @xmath91 ) has @xmath92 ; the best - fitting de vaucouleurs model has @xmath93 .",
    "combining the models gives @xmath94 for this @xmath89 srsic galaxy .",
    "a similar fit to an @xmath95 srsic galaxy yields @xmath96 . in general ,",
    "if galaxies have srsic profiles with @xmath97 , then ` fracdev ` , as computed by the sdss dr3 pipeline , is a monotonically increasing function of the srsic index @xmath64 , and thus can be used as a surrogate for @xmath64 .    a plot of the mean axis ratio @xmath98 as a function of the parameter `",
    "fracdev ` is shown in figure  [ fig : fdev ] .",
    "the mean adaptive moments axis ratio @xmath99 , indicated by the filled circles , shows an increasing trend with ` fracdev ` , from @xmath100 for galaxies with purely exponential profiles ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath101 for galaxies with pure de vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the trend in @xmath98 is not a linear one ; for galaxies with @xmath102 , the value of @xmath98 is nearly constant at @xmath103 ; it is only at @xmath104 that @xmath98 shows an increasing trend with ` fracdev ` .",
    "the mean isophotal axis ratio @xmath105 , indicated by the open circles in figure  [ fig : fdev ] , shows less of a trend with ` fracdev ` . except in the case of nearly pure de vaucouleurs profiles ( @xmath106 )",
    ", the axis ratio of a galaxy in its outer regions does nt seem to depend on its surface brightness profile .    for convenience in analysis ,",
    "we have divided our galaxy sample into four classes , based on the value of ` fracdev ` .",
    "galaxies with @xmath107 , corresponding to a srsic index @xmath108 , are called ` ex ' galaxies ; there are @xmath109 ` ex ' galaxies in our sample .",

    "galaxies with @xmath113 , corresponding to @xmath114 , are labeled ` de / ex ' galaxies ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "finally , galaxies with @xmath116 , corresponding to @xmath117 , are called ` de ' galaxies .",
    "the small fraction of ` de ' galaxies in our sample ( @xmath118 ) is partly due to the fact that the centrally concentrated de vaucouleurs galaxies are less likely to satisfy our resolution criterion , and partly due to the fact that galaxies with high srsic indices are intrinsically rare ; @xcite estimated that only @xmath119 of the sdss galaxies in their sample had srsic index @xmath120 .",
    "the ` de ' galaxies are rounder in their central regions than in their outer regions : @xmath121 .",
    "this is consistent with the ` de ' galaxies being relatively bright elliptical galaxies , for which the isophotal axis ratios tend to decrease with increasing semimajor axis length @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the ` ex ' galaxies are actually slightly flatter in their central regions than in their outer regions : @xmath122 .    for a given surface brightness profile type , there exists a relation between absolute magnitude and apparent axis ratio .",
    "contour plots of mean apparent axis ratio as a function of both ` fracdev ` and @xmath81 are given in figure  [ fig : fdevmag ] .",
    "( to give a feel for the absolute magnitude scale , fitting a schechter function to the luminosity function of sdss galaxies yields @xmath123 @xcite . )",

    "this result is not surprising , since moderately bright galaxies with exponential profiles are intrinsically flattened disk galaxies , while extremely bright galaxies with de vaucouleurs profiles are intrinsically nearly spherical giant elliptical galaxies @xcite . more surprising are the results shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fdevmag ] , which shows @xmath105 , the mean isophotal axis ratio . here ,",
    "we find that the apparently flattest galaxies , as measured by @xmath6 , are not exponential galaxies , but galaxies with @xmath130 ( corresponding to srsic index @xmath131 ) and @xmath132 ; these galaxies have @xmath133 .",

    "note also that for bright galaxies ( @xmath136 ) , the contours of constant @xmath105 in figure  [ fig : fdevmag ] are nearly horizontal .",
    "that is , among bright galaxies , the flattening of the outer isophotes does nt depend strongly on the surface brightness profile type .",
    "a view of the dependence of @xmath98 on absolute magnitude for each of our four profile types , ` ex ' , ` ex / de ' , de / ex , and ` de ' , is given in figure  [ fig : mag ] .",
    "in the upper panel , which shows @xmath99 , note that for each profile type , there is a critical absolute magnitude @xmath137 at which @xmath99 is at a minimum .",
    "this critical absolute magnitude ranges from @xmath138 for the ` de ' galaxies to @xmath139 for the ` ex ' galaxies . at @xmath140 ,",

    "the average axis ratio of ` de ' galaxies is always greater than that of ` ex ' galaxies ; however , for @xmath142 , the flattest galaxies , on average , at a given absolute magnitude are not the ` ex ' galaxies , but those with the mixed ` de / ex ' and ` ex / de ' profile types .",

    "in addition , it is true for any profile type that highly luminous galaxies are rounder , on average , than less luminous galaxies .    knowing the mean shape as a function of @xmath81 for each profile type ( ` de ' , ` de / ex ' , ` ex / de ' , ex ) does not tell us the complete distribution of axis ratios , @xmath152 . in order to compare the distribution of axis ratios for highly luminous galaxies with that for less luminous galaxies",
    ", we determined , for each profile type , the dividing absolute magnitude @xmath153 such that the distribution @xmath154 for galaxies with @xmath155 is maximally different from the distribution @xmath154 for galaxies with @xmath156 .",
    "we measure the difference between the distributions by applying a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test , and finding the value of @xmath153 that minimizes the k - s probability @xmath157 .",

    "although the best fits to the ` ex / de ' and ` ex ' galaxies , under the assumption of constant triaxiality , were prolate or nearly prolate , we have an a priori knowledge that bright galaxies with srsic index @xmath196 are generally rotationally supported disks .",
    "the sdss dr3 photometry of ` ex / de ' and ` ex ' galaxies is consistent with their being nearly oblate objects only if they have a range of @xmath9 , instead of being forced into a straitjacket of uniform @xmath9 .",
    "constraining the flattening @xmath8 and triaxiality @xmath9 of galaxies with different luminosity and profile type provides potentially useful clues for the study of galaxy formation and evolution . for example , the dissipationless merger of two equal - mass disk galaxies embedded within dark halos produces a merger remnant whose luminous component has an approximate de vaucouleurs profile @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the remnant depend on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies , but the remnant is typically quite flat and prolate . for a set of eight simulations with different initial orbits , @xcite found @xmath270 and @xmath271 for the most tightly bound quartile of the luminous particles ( the inner region of the galaxy ) .",
    "this is significantly flatter and more prolate than the shape we deduced from the distribution of @xmath3 for bright ` de ' galaxies .",
    "the oblateness of the merger remnant is increased , however , if the initial merging galaxies are unequal in mass @xcite .    including gaseous dissipation into a simulated merger",
    "can strongly affect @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as the gas dissipates and falls toward the center of the merger remnant , the central mass concentration will scatter stars on low angular momentum box orbits , thus acting to increase @xmath8 and decrease @xmath9 . for instance ,",
    "a simulated remnant that has @xmath272 and @xmath273 in the absence of dissipation will have @xmath274 and @xmath275 if gas dissipation is added @xcite .",
    "the deduced shapes of bright ` de ' galaxies are consistent with their being merger remnants , as long as the mergers were dissipational .    in the standard hierarchical clustering model for structure formation , however , we do not expect most elliptical galaxies to have formed by the relatively recent merger of a pair of spiral galaxies .",
    "more typically , an elliptical galaxy will have formed by the successive merger of a number of smaller galaxies or subgalactic `` clumps '' .",
    "simulations of multiple mergers in small groups reveal that the final merger remnant generally has a surface brightness profile similar to a de vaucouleurs law , but that the shape of the merger remnant depends on the assumed initial conditions @xcite . for instance , @xcite simulated dissipationless mergers of dense clumps embedded in a smooth dark halo .",
    "the profile of the merger remnant , in all cases , was well fit by a de vaucouleurs law .",
    "the triaxiality of the remnant depended primarily on whether the system was initially in a state of virial equilibrium or in a state of non - virial collapse .",
    "the virial case produced more oblate remnants ( @xmath276 ) , while the collapse case produced more prolate remnants ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "the virial case also produced less flattened remnants : @xmath278 for the merger remnants of initially virialized systems versus @xmath279 for initially collapsing systems .",
    "the value of @xmath8 also depended on the initial clump - to - halo mass ratio ; if the clumps contributed only a small fraction of the total mass , they produced a flatter remnant than if they contributed all the mass , with no dark halo .",
    "the best fitting parameters for the bright ` de ' galaxies , @xmath280 and @xmath281 , suggest that they are too flattened and too triaxial to have been formed primarily by mergers within a virialized group , which produce @xmath282 and @xmath276 .",
    "( remember , the effects of dissipation will only act to increase @xmath8 and decrease @xmath9 . )",
    "another influence that is capable of increasing @xmath8 and decreasing @xmath9 is the presence of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "a central mass concentration affects the structure of the surrounding galaxy by disrupting box orbits @xcite .",
    "the resulting chaotic orbits lead to an altered shape for the galaxy ; the trend is toward shapes that are nearly spherical in the inner regions and nearly oblate in the outer regions @xcite . in the inner regions ,",
    "the orbits can support a shape that is nearly oblate , @xmath283 , or strongly triaxial , @xmath284 , but not nearly prolate , @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "the time scale for the shape evolution depends on the mass of the central black hole relative to the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "when the central black hole has a mass equal to 1% of the mass in stars , its shape at the half - mass radius evolves in @xmath286 times the half - mass orbital period ; when the mass is only 0.3% of the stellar mass , the evolution time scale increases to @xmath287 times the orbital period .",
    "the observed relation between central black hole mass and bulge mass @xcite predicts that an elliptical galaxy will typically have a central black hole with a mass @xmath288 of the total mass in stars . for such relatively low black hole masses ,",
    "the shape evolution time scale at the half - mass radius and beyond will exceed the age of the galaxy .",
    "thus , a central black hole will not generally affect the isophotal axis ratio @xmath6 .    the isophotal shape , @xmath6 , measures the apparent shape of a galaxy at a few times the effective radius . converted to physical units , the average semimajor axis @xmath57 of the isophotal ellipse ranges from @xmath289 at @xmath290 to @xmath291 at @xmath292 .",
    "at relatively high luminosities ( @xmath293 ) , the mean value of @xmath6 increases with luminosity ; bright galaxies are rounder than fainter galaxies at their outer regions .",
    "we have also uncovered the puzzling result that at a given luminosity , the mean value of @xmath6 is larger for ` ex ' galaxies than for ` de ' galaxies .",
    "why should ` ex ' galaxies , which are flattened disks in their central regions , be rounder than ` de ' galaxies in their outskirts ? at such great distances from the galaxy s center , we expect that tidal distortions from neighboring galaxies will significantly affect the isophotal shape .",
    "galaxies in dense regions , such as the cores of clusters , are subject to more interactions with neighboring galaxies , and may well differ systematically in shape from field galaxies , which are less frequently harassed . since",
    "elliptical galaxies are found preferentially in dense environments , this conjectured environment  shape relation would then translate into a relation between profile type and shape . a future paper , studying the relation between apparent axis ratio and environment for",
