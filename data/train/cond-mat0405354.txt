    "alkali atom gas undergoes phase transition to a superfluid phase at very low temperatures ( @xmath6k ) to form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "this new bec is different from the conventional superfluid @xmath7he in that ( i ) it is a weakly coupled system for which the gross - pitaevskii equation is applicable with high precision at low temperatures ( ii ) alkali atoms have hyperfine spin degrees of freedom @xmath8 and , accordingly , the order parameter has @xmath9 components @xcite while @xmath7he atoms have no such internal structure ( iii ) external magnetic field couples with the hyperfine spin , allowing for easy control of the condensate order parameter , among others . for example , the atoms @xmath0na and @xmath1rb have internal states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , for which the number of components is 3 and 5 , respectively . associated with bec is a quantized vortex , which demonstrates the existence of coherent property and superfluidity of the condensate .",
    "the study of vortices in bec of alkali atoms started as soon as the bec was discovered and several scenarios for vortex formation were proposed , namely ( i ) dynamical phase imprinting @xcite , ( ii ) optical spoon @xcite ( iii ) rotating asymmetric trap @xcite and ( iv ) topological phase imprinting @xcite .",
    "we will be concerned in the present paper with a vortex formation in the last scenario under the gravitational field .    in topological phase imprinting",
    ", the bec is confined in a quadrupole magnetic field and a bias field orthogonal to it . as the bias field",
    "is adiabatically reversed , the condensate spin follows the direction of the local magnetic field and position dependent order parameter phase is imprinted in bec in such a way that a vortex is created along the axis of the trap when the bias field is reversed .",
    "this scenario has been verified in beautiful experiments at mit and reported in leanhard _ et .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath10 and @xmath11 hyperfine states of @xmath0na have been utilized .",
    "the analysis based on berry s phase @xcite , as well as numerical solutions @xcite , predicts that a vortex thus created has the winding number @xmath12 , which was also verified in @xcite .    in recent experiments conducted at kyoto university @xcite , where bec of @xmath1rb has been used",
    ", they observed that fine - tuning of the field reverse time @xmath2 is required for topological formation of a stable vortex .",
    "vortex fragmentation or no vortex has been observed for different choices of @xmath2 .",
    "we show , in this paper , the existence of a narrow window in @xmath2 for successful formation of a stable vortex is attributed to a subtle role played by the gravitational field and the heavier mass of @xmath1rb compared to @xmath0na .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we outline the formalism of the problem based on the multi - component spinor gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical results which verify our statements .",
    "it is shown that our @xmath2 for stable vortex formation approximately reproduces that obtained in kyoto experiments .",
    "conclusions and discussion are given in sec .",
    "we will be mostly concerned with bec of @xmath1rb in @xmath11 hyperfine state .",
    "the case @xmath10 may be analyzed in a similar manner with considerably less effort .",
    "we first introduce the order parameter for @xmath11 bec and the gross - pitaevskii equation which describes the dynamics of the condensate @xcite .",
    "topological vortex formation in the presence of a gravitational field is then discussed in detail .",
    "let us consider a uniform bec with hyperspin @xmath11 .",
    "the internal state of the condensate may be classified according to the eigenvalue @xmath13 of the operator @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is denoted as @xmath16 : @xmath17 . as for the eigenvectors we employ the following convention @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for transpose operation .",
    "an arbitrary order parameter is then expanded as @xmath20    in case the external magnetic field @xmath21 is position - dependent , the classification of the hyperfine state in terms of @xmath13 is not appropriate and , instead , the eigenstates of @xmath22 must be utilized .",
    "consider the order parameter @xmath23 which satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstate with respect to an arbitrary @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 is obtained by rotating @xmath28 through euler angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "explicit calculation shows that @xmath31 where the last equality defines @xmath32 .",
    "this state is under an attractive force toward a region with smaller @xmath33 and hence is called a weak - field - seeking state ( wfss ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath34 starting from @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : base ] ) , which is also called a weak - field - seeking state .",
    "the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 , obtained from @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , are called strong - field - seeking states ( sfss ) while the state @xmath40 is independent of the magnetic field and will be called the neutral state ( ns ) .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath11 bec in the limit of zero temperature is given , within the mean field approximation , by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which is extended so that the spin degrees of freedom are taken into account as @xcite @xmath41 \\psi_m \\nonumber\\\\ & & + g_1|\\psi_n|^2 \\psi_m      + g_2\\left[\\psi_{n}^\\dagger ( f_{k})_{np } \\psi_{p}\\right ]     ( f_{k})_{mq}\\psi_q \\nonumber\\\\     & & + 5g_3\\psi_n^\\dagger \\langle 2m2n|00\\rangle     \\langle 00|2p2q\\rangle \\psi_p\\psi_q \\nonumber\\\\ & &    + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega_{lk}(f_k)_{mn}\\psi_n , \\label{eq : gptime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summations are over @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here , @xmath44 is the mass of the atom and the gravitational force is assumed to be along the positive @xmath45 axis .",
    "the larmor frequency is defined as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the atom , @xmath48 being the bohr magneton .",
    "the interaction parameters @xmath49 are expressed in terms of the @xmath50-wave scattering length @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the total hyperfine spin of the two - body scattering state , and are given by @xcite @xmath53 the parameters are @xmath54 nm , @xmath55 nm and @xmath56 nm for @xmath1rb atoms .",
    "suppose a wfss with @xmath57 is placed in a ioffe - pritchard trap .",
    "we consider a condensate uniform along the @xmath58 axis and confined within the @xmath59 plane by the quadrupole magnetic field @xmath60 where @xmath61 is , to a good approximation , linear in @xmath62 within the thomas - fermi radius ; @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 are the cylindrical coordinates where the axis of the magnetic trap is taken as the @xmath58 axis .",
    "to prevent the condensate from escaping from the trap through majorana flips , a uniform bias field @xmath65 must be applied along the @xmath58 axis , where we have explicitly written the @xmath66 dependence of the bias field , which is necessary for topological phase imprinting .",
    "the total magnetic field is thus given by @xmath67 the condensate would be cylindrically symmetric around the @xmath58 axis if it were not for the gravitation field . in the presence of the gravitational field with a potential @xmath68 , in contrast , the condensate is not symmetric any more .",
    "the initial condensate profile is determined by solving the stationary gp equation , in which the @xmath69 wfss ( [ eq : wfss ] ) is substituted .",
    "the angles in ( [ eq : wfss ] ) are now given by @xmath70 it is assumed that the initial state is vortex free , which forces us to choose @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfss ] ) .",
    "the ground state condensate profile corresponds to the lowest energy eigenvalue of the equation @xmath72(f_0 v_m)&+&(g_1 + 4 g_2 ) f_0 ^ 3 v_m \\nonumber\\\\ + \\hbar \\omega_l f_0 v_m & = & \\mu f_0 v_m,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 the eigenvalue @xmath76 is identified with the chemical potential .",
    "if @xmath77 is multiplied from the left and @xmath78 and similar identities are employed , we obtain the reduced gp equation for @xmath79 ; @xmath80\\nonumber\\\\ & & -mgx f_0 + ( g_1 + 4 g_2 ) f_0 ^ 3 + \\hbar \\omega_l f_0 = \\mu f_0 , \\label{eq : gs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial condensate profile and the chemical potential @xmath76 are obtained by solving ( [ eq : gs ] ) numerically . the uniform bias field",
    "is then reversed as @xmath81 it has been shown , in the previous works @xcite without taking gravity into account , that a vortex formation takes place at the center of the condensate when the bias field has been reversed .",
    "the bias field disappears at @xmath82 and the @xmath69 condensate transforms into @xmath83 components through majorana flips .",
    "the components with @xmath84 are not confined and escape from the trap .",
    "the final condensate is then made of a mixture of the @xmath85 and @xmath69 wfss .",
    "it is found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfss ] ) with @xmath86 that the vortex in the @xmath69 component has the winding number four while a similar condensate amplitude for @xmath5 tells us that the vortex in this component has the winding number three @xcite .",
    "it is essential , therefore , to employ the full spinor gp equation ( [ eq : gptime ] ) to analyze this system .    in the presence of the gravitational field , however , the center of the condensate shifts from the axis of the magnetic trap and , moreover , the minimum of the trapping potential , including gravity , depends on the hyperfine state due to the last term in ( [ eq : gptime ] ) . to be more concrete , the @xmath3 component of the condensate in the ioffe - pritchard trap is subject to the external potential @xmath87",
    "note that the center of the quadrupole field is @xmath88 while the minimum of the potential is @xmath89 where we have assumed that @xmath90 , which always holds in actual experiments .",
    "otherwise , there is no stable minima in the @xmath45-direction and the condensate can not be confined .",
    "observe that the deviation @xmath91 has the same time dependence as @xmath92 and that it is larger for @xmath5 than for @xmath69 , implying that there is a finite distance between the centers of the @xmath5 and @xmath69 condensates .",
    "it is important to note also that @xmath91 is proportional to the atomic mass @xmath44 , provided that @xmath93 , and hence the effect of the gravity on the condensate is more prominent for atoms with heavy mass .",
    "the potential @xmath94 is approximated by a displaced harmonic potential when @xmath95 , taking the form @xmath96\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{m g^2}{2 \\omega_{\\rm ho}^2(t)}+\\frac{1}{2}m_b \\gamma_{\\mu}|b_z(t)| , \\label{eq : harmapp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 the displacement @xmath98 found from ( [ eq : harmapp ] ) is in agreement with the result ( [ eq : exact ] ) when @xmath93 .",
    "the frequency @xmath99 serves as an energy scale of the system . the gravitational potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exactpot ] ) leads to two remarkable effects on vortex formation .",
    "first , for @xmath11 bec , there are two wfss , one ( @xmath5 ) has three units of vorticities while the other ( @xmath69 ) has four units .",
    "their positions deviate due to the difference in @xmath3 , which makes the interaction between the condensate even more complicated .",
    "secondly , the minimum of the potential shifts from the center of the quadrupole field , where the topological vortex formation takes place . a highly quantized vortex with winding number @xmath100 is unstable against decay into @xmath101 singly quantized vortices .",
    "the lifetime of a highly quantized vortex is longer if its axis is at the center of the condensate .",
    "if it is off - centered , in contrast , it is expected that the vortex moves toward the edge of the condensate and split into @xmath101 singly quantized vortices .",
    "therefore a topologically created vortex under gravity will be unstable against decay unless some caution is exercised , see the next section . if the deviation of the center of the quadrupole field is large compared to the thomas - fermi radius , the `` vortex formation '' takes place outside the condensate and it is impossible to observe the vortex .",
    "these effects are more prominent in @xmath1rb compared to @xmath0na . in kyoto experiments , the parameter @xmath102 $ ] is taken to be the same as the mit experiment",
    ". then the thomas - fermi radius @xmath103 has mass dependence @xmath104 through @xmath105 since the factor @xmath106 roughly takes the same value for both experiments .",
    "the above consideration shows that the behavior of the condensate depends heavily on the atomic mass @xmath44 and the reverse time @xmath2 .",
    "we solved the spinor gp equation ( [ eq : gptime ] ) numerically for various @xmath2 for both @xmath0na and @xmath1rb .",
    "in the next section , we outline mainly the results for the @xmath11 condensate of @xmath1rb and then compare them with those for @xmath0na .",
    "we have solved the stationary gp equation ( [ eq : gs ] ) numerically to obtain the vortex - free initial condensate profile @xmath107 and the chemical potential @xmath76 .",
    "we then solved the time - dependent spinor gp equation ( [ eq : gptime ] ) with @xmath108 as the initial state .",
    "we had to pay special attention to particles escaping form the trap .",
    "this is taken care of by introducing an appropriate absorption potential beyond which the condensate amplitude decays exponentially .",
    "we found slight interference patters due to reflection at the absorption potential , although we believe that this does not cause any qualitative change in conclusion .",
    "as for numerical values , we take the following numbers reproducing the kyoto experiments : @xmath109,\\",
    "\\omega_z= 2\\pi \\times 17\\;[{\\rm hz}]$ ] .",
    "the thomas - fermi radius is then @xmath110 .",
    "the initial bias field is @xmath111 , which is then reduced to @xmath112 .",
    "it turns out that a stable vortex formation takes place only for @xmath2 in a small window around @xmath113 .",
    "the behavior of the bec is qualitatively different for @xmath2 out of this window from the case @xmath113 .",
    "this is in harmony with the observation made by the kyoto group @xcite .",
    "therefore we take @xmath114 and @xmath115 as typical values representing the three classes of @xmath2 .",
    "the change in @xmath117 is slow in this case and each wfss component of the condensate follows its equilibrium position ( [ eq : exact ] ) as @xmath117 is reversed .",
    "there is essentially a single condensate with @xmath69 at @xmath118 .",
    "majorana flips take place at @xmath119 in the vicinity of the point where the magnetic field vanishes .",
    "the center of @xmath69 condensate is separated from that of @xmath5 condensate from then on .",
    "there exists a vortex with the winding number four ( three ) in the @xmath69 ( @xmath5 ) condensate , which are created at the center of the quadrapole field at around @xmath82 .",
    "the center of the condensate is at the center of the quadrupole field only at @xmath120 and its subsequent position follows the minimum of the potential , which depends on @xmath3 . then these components interact in a complicated manner with each other and vortex fragmentation takes place .",
    "figure 1 shows the total density profile @xmath121 and the component profile @xmath122 for @xmath123 with @xmath124 .      a window for stable vortex formation exists in the vicinity of @xmath113 .",
    "the condensate is pushed up by reducing @xmath126 and the center of the condensate reaches the center of the quadrupole field at @xmath127 as in the previous case .",
    "the minimum of the potential follows the path it took for @xmath128 backward after @xmath129 .",
    "the condensate , however , fails to follow the potential minimum since it has been accelerated upward . during the acceleration ,",
    "all atoms are in a single hyperfine state and equally accelerated .",
    "following the majorana flips at @xmath130 , each component eventually reaches a peak with some delay , after which it starts to fall chasing for the corresponding potential minimum .",
    "the delay is longer if the acceleration is larger , i.e. @xmath2 is smaller , and the strength of the confinement is weaker .",
    "the latter condition depends on @xmath3 as shown explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega2 ] ) .    if @xmath2 is fine - tuned to be around 2ms , the distance between the two condensates with @xmath5 and @xmath69 happens to be small at @xmath131 in spite of separated potential minima for respective components .",
    "therefore the @xmath69 vortex with the winding number four is not yet disturbed by the @xmath85 vortex with the winding number three , see fig .  2 .",
    "observe that the center of the @xmath5 component is below ( above ) that of the @xmath69 component at @xmath131 in fig .  1 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "vortex fragmentation occurs at @xmath132 when the distance between the condensates becomes larger as in the previous case .",
    "since the change in @xmath126 is fast , the condensate can not follow the minimum of the potential ( [ eq : exact ] ) and does not reach the center of the quadrupole field at @xmath129 .",
    "the center of the vortex always appears in the center of the quadrupole field and thus the vortex axis appears above the center of the condensate in this case .",
    "the vortex thus created has the winding number four and a highly quantized off - centered vortex is expected to decay quickly into four singly quantized vortices @xcite .",
    "this is in fact manifest in fig . 3 at @xmath134 . in kyoto experiments",
    "@xcite , the wavy edge of the condensate is observed when @xmath2 is smaller compared to that for stable vortex formation .",
    "this might be attributed to the fragmented vortices .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the effect of the gravitational field on the topological vortex formation in bec of heavy atoms , such as @xmath1rb , is not negligible . unless the reverse time @xmath2 is fine - tuned , fragmentation of a multiply",
    "quantized vortex takes place during topological phase engineering .",
    "this fragmentation is attributed to the existence of two wfsss with @xmath5 and @xmath135 , whose centers are separated , under gravity , by distance comparable to the thomas - fermi radius .",
    "wfss with @xmath5 supports a vortex with three units of winding number while that with @xmath69 supports four units .",
    "when the two vortices have the same center , there exists an axially symmetric stable solution  @xcite .",
    "if the vortex centers are displaced from each other , however , the two wfsss interfere with each other through the @xmath136- and @xmath137-terms in eq .   so that the deviation from axial symmetry is further amplified , leading to fragmentation observed in  @xcite .",
    "when the field is reversed so slowly that each hyperfine state follows its potential minimum , the center of two hyperfine components deviate from each other as soon as majorana flips take place at @xmath82 , leading to vortex fragmentation .",
    "when the field is reversed so fast , in contrast , the condensate fails to follow the potential minimum and the deviation of two components at @xmath131 is minute .",
    "the vortex is , however , imprinted near the edge of the condensate , which leads to spliting of the multiply quantized vortex into singly quantized vortices .",
    "the fragmentation pattern often has two - fold symmetry , which originates from the vertical displacement of two condensates  @xcite . to observe a stable multiply quantized vortex",
    ", the field reverse time must be taken somewhere between above two cases .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the gravitational field on the bec of @xmath0na with @xmath11 , which corresponds to the mit experiments .",
    "we have shown that there exist a similar window of @xmath2 for a topological formation of a stable vortex in this case .",
