    "elastic electron - nucleon scattering in the one - photon exchange approximation gives direct access to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , an essential piece of information about its structure . in recent years",
    ", the ratio @xmath0 of the proton s electric to magnetic form factors has been measured up to large momentum transfer @xmath1 in precision experiments  @xcite using the polarisation transfer method .",
    "it came as a surprise that these experiments for @xmath1 up to 5.6 gev@xmath2 extracted a ratio of @xmath0 which is incompatible with unpolarized measurements @xcite using the rosenbluth separation technique .",
    "it has been suggested on general grounds in ref .",
    "@xcite that this puzzle may be explained by a two - photon exchange amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twophoton ] ) whose magnitude is a few percent of the one photon exchange term .",
    "the failure of the one - photon approximation for elastic electron - nucleon scattering is amplified at large @xmath1 in the case of the rosenbluth extraction of @xmath0 , but affects the polarization method only little .",
    "a model calculation of the two - photon exchange amplitude when the hadronic intermediate state is a nucleon was performed in ref .",
    "it found that the @xmath3 exchange correction with intermediate nucleon can partially resolve the discrepancy between the two experimental techniques .",
    "very recently , the two - photon exchange contribution to elastic electron - nucleon scattering has been estimated at large momentum transfer  @xcite , through the scattering off a parton in the proton by relating the process on the nucleon to the generalized parton distributions .",
    "this calculation found that the @xmath3 exchange contribution is indeed able to quantitatively resolve the discrepancy between rosenbluth and polarization transfer experiments .",
    "= 16.cm    to use electron scattering as a precision tool , one needs a good control of the two - photon exchange mechanisms , which justifies a systematic study of these effects , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the real ( dispersive ) part of the two - photon exchange amplitude can be accessed through the difference between elastic electron and positron scattering off a nucleon .",
    "the imaginary ( absorptive ) part of the two - photon exchange amplitude on the other hand can be accessed through a single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in elastic electron - nucleon scattering , when either the target or beam spin are polarized normal to the scattering plane . as time",
    "reversal invariance forces this ssa to vanish in the one - photon exchange approximation , it requires the exchange of at least two photons between lepton and nucleon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twophoton ] ) , and hence it is of order @xmath4 . in the context of qed , such normal spin asymmetries have been discussed long time ago  @xcite . in ref .",

    "recently , the e158 experiment at slac  @xcite has measured the mller scattering @xmath7 with normal beam spin polarization , allowing for a precsion comparison with the latest qed calculations  @xcite , including leading logarithmic qed corrections due to intial and final state radiation effects . to get an order of magnitude estimate for the beam normal ssa",
    ", we have to consider that , besides the reduction by an overall factor @xmath8 , the polarization of an ultra - relativistic electron in the direction normal to its momentum involves a suppression factor @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 the electron beam energy ) , which is of order @xmath11 to @xmath12 for beam energies in the few gev range .",
    "therefore , the beam normal ssa is of order @xmath13 ( for some order of magnitude estimates , see refs .",
    "a measurement of such small asymmetries is quite demanding experimentally .",
    "however , in the case of a polarized lepton beam , asymmetries of the order ppm are currently accessible in parity violation ( pv ) elastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "the parity violating asymmetry involves a beam spin aligned in the direction of its momentum .",
    "the ssa for an electron beam spin normal to the scattering plane , which corresponds with a flip of the lepton helicity , can also be measured using the same experimental set - ups .",
    "first measurements of this beam normal ssa at beam energies below 1 gev have yielded values as large as 10 ppm in magnitude  @xcite . at higher beam energies ,",
    "the beam normal ssa can be measured in upcoming pv elastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "one may therefore envisage the possibility in near future to access this asymmetry at larger momentum transfer ( for @xmath1 around or larger than 1  gev@xmath2 ) , where one may expect that the scattering off a parton starts to dominate .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop the formalism for elastic electron - nucleon scattering with a flip of the lepton helicity . to provide an estimate for the two - photon amplitudes , we extend the partonic calculation of ref .",

    "the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath3 exchange amplitudes are related .",

    "it is seen that also the nucleon pole contribution to @xmath62 for the neutron is suppressed , and is largely negligible compared to the inelastic one in the forward angular range .",
    "in summary , we have developed in this work the formalism for elastic lepton - nucleon scattering with a lepton helicity flip , beyond the one - photon exchange approximation . we have shown that the imaginary part of the two - photon exchange amplitude can be accessed through the single spin asymmetry for a lepton beam polarized normal to the scattering plane .",
    "we provided an estimate for this normal beam spin asymmetry @xmath62 in a partonic framework , used before to evaluate the lepton helicity conserving amplitudes . in our calculation , the normal beam spin asymmetry at large momentum transfer is estimated through the scattering off a parton , which is embedded in the nucleon through a generalized parton distribution . using phenomenological parametrizations for the gpds , we found that for the proton , @xmath62 yields values around + 1 ppm to + 1.5 ppm in the few gev beam energy range .",
    "in particular , we found that the forward angular range for @xmath169 scattering is a favorable region to get information on the inelastic part of @xmath62 .",
    "because in the handbag calculation considered here , real and imaginary parts are linked , a direct measurement of @xmath62 may yield a valuable cross - check of the estimate for the real part , which was found crucial in understanding the unpolarized cross section data for @xmath173 at large momentum transfer .",
    "a measurement of @xmath62 can be performed by the same experiments that are set up to measure parity violation in @xmath174 scattering by choosing a normal polarization for the electron beam instead .",
    "this may open up a new experimental front to access the two - photon exchange amplitudes in elastic electron - nucleon scattering .",
