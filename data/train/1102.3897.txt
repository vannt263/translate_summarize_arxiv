    "invisibility `` cloaking '' refers to the idea of making an object appear invisible , or at least greatly reducing its scattering cross - section , by surrounding it with appropriate materials , and has attracted extensive popular and research interest following a theoretical proposal by pendry  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , cloaking of isolated objects turns out to be severely restricted , in that speed - of - light / causality constraints intrinsically limit perfect cloaking to an infinitesimal bandwidth  @xcite .",
    "an alternative with no intrinsic bandwidth limitations is ground - plane cloaking  @xcite , in which the goal is to make an object sitting on a reflective surface indistinguishable from the bare surface . in this paper , however , we show that _ both _ forms of cloaking are subject to practical difficulties that increase as the size of the cloaked object grows , generalizing a simple one - dimensional argument that we previously applied to ground - plane cloaking  @xcite .",
    "we focus most of our attention on the case of ground - plane cloaking , which seems to be the most practical possibility , but we then show that a very similar analysis applies to cloaking of isolated objects . in both cases ,",
    "our key starting point is the assumption that the attainable refractive indices are bounded , in which case we show that the cloak thickness must scale with the object size and hence any losses per unit volume ( including both absorption and scattering from imperfections ) must scale inversely with the object size .",
    "it has been suggested that gain could be used to compensate for absorption loss ( but not other imperfections ) in the cloak  @xcite , but a corollary of our results is that such compensation must become increasingly exact as the object diameter increases .",
    "although there have been several experimental demonstrations of ground - plane cloaking  @xcite , as well as theoretical investigation of several variations on the underlying idea  @xcite , we previously argued using a simple one - dimensional model system that the difficulty of ground - plane cloaking must increase proportional to the thickness of the object being cloaked  @xcite . in this paper , we generalize that simple argument to a rigorous proof for arbitrary cloaking transformations in three dimensions .",
    "we demonstrate that the thickness of the cloak must scale proportional to the size of the object , given bounded material properties .",
    "( previously , we arrived at a similar conclusion in one dimension from the delay ",
    "bandwidth product  @xcite , but here our result is derived independent of the bandwidth , although the bounds on the indices ultimately depend on the bandwidth . ) from this , if one requires a bounded reduction in the scattering cross - section , it follows that the loss ( due to absorption or other imperfections ) per unit volume must scale inversely with the object thickness , and we quantify this scaling more precisely in the case of absorption loss and scattering from disorder . for a lossy ambient medium such as a fluid ( with an observer close enough to see the object ) , the losses of the cloak must asymptotically approach those of the ambient medium , and defects / roughness that scatter light must still vanish , so there is still a sensitivity to imperfections .",
    "( on the other hand , ambient fluids have the advantage that it is easier to index - match them with a solid cloak without resorting to complicated metamaterial microstructures susceptible to manufacturing imperfections .",
    "this helped recent authors , using natural birefringent materials , to demonstrate cloaking effects at visible wavelengths for cm - scale structures  @xcite . ) in addition to scattering and loss , systematic imperfections ( such as an overall shift in the indices or an overall neglect of anisotropy in favor of approximate isotropic materials  @xcite ) must also vanish inversely with object thickness , since such systematic errors produce a worst - case phase shift in the reflected field proportional to the imperfection and the thickness of the cloak ( the path length , which scales with the object ) .",
    "( for oblique angles of incidence , such phase shifts can cause a lateral shift in the reflected beam  @xcite , analogous to a goos - hnchen shift . )",
    "cloaking of isolated objects , on the other hand , is already subject to severe bandwidth restrictions : perfect cloaking in vacuum over a nonzero bandwidth would imply rays traveling at greater than the speed of light around the object  @xcite , which can be interpreted as a causality violation  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the isolated - cloaking problem is of considerable fundamental theoretical interest  @xcite , and several groups have demonstrated single - frequency cloaking of small objects in experiments  @xcite .",
    "although several theoretical simulations included absorption loss  @xcite , the first work we are aware of to suggest a tradeoff between absorption tolerance and object size was ref .  .",
    "based on these numerical experiments  @xcite and on comparison with ground - plane cloaking , we suggested  @xcite that even single - frequency isolated - object cloaking must become increasingly difficult as the cloaked object becomes bigger , and in this paper we are able to prove that result analytically .",
    "in particular , assuming that the attainable refractive indices are bounded above , we show that the cloak thickness must scale proportional to the object diameter and any cloak losses ( absorption or imperfections ) must scale inversely with diameter .",
    "( experimentally , the group to claim isolated cloaking of an object more than wavelength - scale in diameter  @xcite did not do so in vacuum , but rather within a parallel - plate waveguide system free of complex microstructures and hence with very low intrinsic losses . )",
    "another limitation on isolated object cloaking is that the singularity of the cloaking transformation ( which maps an object to a single point ) corresponds to very extreme material responses ( e.g. vanishing effective indices ) at the inner surface of a perfect cloak  @xcite . here ,",
    "independent of our results on losses , we show that if the attainable refractive indices are bounded below , then the cloak is necessarily imperfect : it reduces the object cross section by a bounded fraction , even for otherwise lossless and perfect materials .",
    "( previous authors showed that the bounded reduction in the cross section obtained from a non - singular cloaking transformation could be partially defeated by resonant inclusions in the object  @xcite , but this problem seems avoidable by a cloak with a reflective inner surface that masks the nature of the cloaked object . )",
    "both of these diameter - scaling limitations are apparent if one looks at explicit examples of cloaking transformations , such as pendry s original linear scaling  @xcite , but our results differ from such observations in that they hold in general for any arbitrary transformation , including transformations that are not spherically symmetrical .",

    "the scattering cross - section ( nonzero due to imperfections in the cloak ) for any incident wave is bounded above by some fraction @xmath18 of the geometric cross - section @xmath19 .",

    "first , @xmath22 can be bounded due to the bound @xmath16 on the index change above .",
    "second , an even tighter bound follows from the fact that the outer surface @xmath9 of the cloak is invariant under the coordinate transformation . in particular , defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the first two columns of @xmath3 and denoting singular values of @xmath3 by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 are eigenvalues of @xmath27  @xcite ) , referring to the cross sections @xmath28 defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloak - int ] , we show the following sequence of bounds : @xmath29 step  ( [ eq : vc2 ] ) follows from @xmath30 , and @xmath31 for any vector @xmath32  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : cloak - int ] ) is identical in @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the flat surface @xmath37 is the minimal area for this boundary .",
    "finally , step eq .",
    "( [ eq : vc5 ] ) stems from elementary properties of singular values : the eigenvalues of @xmath38 are simply @xmath39  @xcite , and algebraic manipulation of this inequality yields @xmath40 .",

    "these are mapped to curved surfaces @xmath34 in @xmath4 .",

    "suppose the object is illuminated by an incident planewave with electric - field amplitude @xmath44 , which means that the total field ( incident + reflected ) in the ambient medium and in @xmath45 has amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "for a perfect cloak , the fields in the cloak @xmath2 are simply given by @xmath47 multiplied by the reflected planewave in virtual space @xmath5  @xcite , and hence the field amplitude @xmath48 in the cloak is @xmath49 ( using the bounds on the singular values @xmath25 from above ) .",
    "we must consider the worst - case losses for arbitrary incident waves ; since this is bounded below by the loss from any particular incident wave , it is convenient to consider glancing - angle @xmath50-polarized planewaves where the field is a constant @xmath44 everywhere in @xmath45 and @xmath51 in the cloak ( from the bound on @xmath52 ) .",
    "an absorption imperfection is a small deviation @xmath53 in the imaginary part of @xmath0 compared with @xmath54 .",
    "( similarly for @xmath1 , but it suffices to consider electric absorption here . )",
    "this gives a change @xmath55 in the time - average absorbed power at a frequency @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath57 , we can take @xmath58 to be the field in the perfect cloak , and suppose for simplicity that the absorption is isotropic ( @xmath53 is a scalar ) , and therefore the worst - case change in the absorbed power is @xmath59 .",
    "combined with our initial requirement on the scattering cross - section , the change in the absorbed power must be @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the incident intensity , and we obtain the following bound : @xmath62 ( using the @xmath2 inequality above ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath63 scales as @xmath64 , so this means that the mean @xmath53 scales inversely with the thickness of the object to be cloaked .",
    "( the @xmath65 dependence means that this can be interpreted as a bound on the conductivity . )",
    "equation  ( [ eq : loss - necessary ] ) is a necessary condition on the loss , but is too optimistic to be a sufficient condition .",
    "for example , suppose that the ambient medium is lossy , so that @xmath66 can have either sign depending on whether the cloak is more or less lossy than the ambient medium ( or alternatively , @xmath67 could come from gain ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : loss - necessary ] ) is satisfied if the more - lossy and less - lossy regions of the cloak average to zero , but in fact this will not result in a zero scattering cross - section for arbitrary incident waves . for example , a narrow incident beam ( rather than a planewave ) will interrogate the loss in some regions of the cloak more than others , and even a planewave at a different angle will create a standing - wave pattern that has higher field intensity in some regions  in these cases , any delicate cancellation in the absorption will be destroyed . instead , we can derive a sufficient condition on the loss by bounding the change in absorption above rather than below .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 this is , perhaps , stronger than strictly necessary ; we conjecture that a weaker sufficient condition exists that replaces latexmath:[$\\max",
    "@xmath53 in the smallest region that can be interrogated by an incident wave ( i.e. some wavelength - scale region ) .",
    "regardless , both the sufficient and necessary conditions on the absorption imperfections scale inversely with the object thickness .",
    "this is true regardless of whether the ambient medium is lossy , and also means that any gain - based compensation of absorption must become increasingly exact for larger objects .",
    "small random imperfections can be thought of as scatterers distributed randomly throughout @xmath2 with some polarizability @xmath70 ( dipole moment @xmath71 )  @xcite .",
    "for example , a small change @xmath57 in a small region @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "computing @xmath70 for surface roughness is more involved , but is conceptually similar  @xcite .",
    "if these imperfections are uncorrelated , then on average the scattered power is simply the mean dipole radiation from each scatterer multiplied by the density @xmath74 of scatterers ( the radiation from different scatterers is incoherent , so interference terms average to zero )  @xcite .",
    "this radiation is most easily computed by transforming each scatterer back to virtual space @xmath5 , where the polarizability is @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 from above",
    ". the radiated power of a point source in virtual space ( homogeneous above a ground plane ) varies with distance and orientation above the ground plane due to the image dipole source below the ground plane , but the worst - case ( over all incident waves ) average ( over all scatterer positions ) scattered power is proportional ( with a constant factor of order unity ) to the radiated power of a point source in the homogeneous medium , @xmath77  @xcite . multiplying this by the number @xmath78 of scatterers and comparing to the requirement on the worst - case loss , one finds that @xmath79 is bounded above by a quantity proportional to @xmath80 , which again scales inversely with the thickness of the cloaked object .",
    "note that , while gain could conceivably be used to compensate for absorption loss , it does not seem applicable to scattering from imperfections .",
    "consider the problem of cloaking an isolated object of volume @xmath10 in a homogeneous isotropic ambient medium using a transformation - based cloak of volume @xmath2 surrounding the object .",
    "as above , the cloak material is determined from a coordinate mapping with jacobian @xmath3 , via the equations @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "now , however , there is no ground plane , and so the coordinate mapping instead attempts to shrink the object : it maps the physical space @xmath4 to a virtual space @xmath5 in which the object volume @xmath10is mapped to a smaller volume @xmath83 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloak - iso ] .",
    "( as for ground - plane cloaking , the outer cloak surface @xmath9 is invariant , since the transformation is the identity outside of the cloak . )",
    "perfect cloaking corresponds to the case in which @xmath83 is a single point , but we will show that this is not possible if the index contrast ( eigenvalues of @xmath84 ) is bounded below by @xmath85 as above .",
    "we will also show results analogous to our results for ground - plane cloaking : if the index contrast is bounded above by @xmath16 , then the thickness of the cloak must scale with the object diameter , and correspondingly the losses ( from absorption or imperfection ) in the cloak must decrease with the object diameter .    before developing our general results , however , we will begin with a specific illustrative example which demonstrates these scalings : an adaptation of pendry s linear - scaling cloak design  @xcite to a nonzero @xmath83 .",
    "suppose that the cloaked object is a sphere of radius @xmath86 and the cloak has outer radius @xmath87 .",
    "we shrink the object to a sphere of radius @xmath88 with the transformation @xmath89 in spherical coordinates .",
    "this leads to the following transformed materials in the cloak region ( applying the general spherical - coordinate version of the transformation  @xcite : @xmath90 ^ 2}{r^2 } \\label{eq : theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at the inner cloak surface @xmath91 , the radial components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 simplify to @xmath92 , which vanishes for @xmath93 .",
    "if we impose a lower bound @xmath17 on the singular values of @xmath94 , however , then @xmath88 can not vanish .",
    "in particular , if @xmath95 then @xmath96 , and hence the area reduction @xmath97 .",
    "below , we show in general ( for arbitrary non - spherical transformations ) that a @xmath98 condition imposes a lower bound on the area reduction .",
    "even if @xmath99 , there is still a relationship between the index - contrast upper bound @xmath16 and the cloak thickness",
    ". suppose @xmath100",
    "( i.e. it is an effective cloak ) .",
    "then the tangential components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath101 , from which it immediately follows that the cloak thickness @xmath102 is bounded by @xmath103 .",
    "this is identical to what we found for ground - plane cloaking , above : cloak thickness scales with object thickness divided by @xmath16 .",
    "below , we will generalize this thickness scaling to arbitrary non - spherical cloaks .",
    "in this section , we show in general that the @xmath104 , the effective surface area of the cloaked object , must be @xmath105 .",
    "that is , if @xmath98 , then the area @xmath104 as seen by an observer must scale proportional to the object area , so that the cross section is reduced by a bounded factor .",
    "( for objects much larger than the wavelength , the scattering cross section is proportional to the geometric cross section @xmath104 . ) from the spherical example above , it might be possible to derive an even tighter @xmath106 bound on @xmath104 , but the @xmath107 bound here is sufficient to demonstrate the scaling with @xmath108 .",
    "our basic approach is to write down @xmath108 in terms of an integral over @xmath104 , and then to bound the integral : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is some coordinate system of the surfaces , @xmath111 is the area element in @xmath104 , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are columns of the jacobian matrix as in sec .  [",
    "sec : thickness ] .",
    "we must then bound @xmath114 similar to our previous analysis , but this is conceptually complicated somewhat by the fact that the coordinate system here is non - cartesian , meaning that @xmath3 no longer has the same bounds . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we apply a standard trick from differential geometry  @xcite : we cover the surface @xmath104 with small overlapping neighborhoods @xmath115 ( a locally finite open covering  @xcite ) where the surface is locally approximately flat , in which case we can define a local cartesian coordinate system and use the cartesian bounds on @xmath3 ( ultimately taking the limit of infinitesimal neighborhoods so that the local flatness becomes exact ) . to combine these local results , one uses a partition of unity  @xcite :",
    "a set of `` bump '' functions @xmath116 ( nonzero only on @xmath115 ) such that @xmath117 on @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we obtain : @xmath118 now , in the limit of infinitesimal neighborhoods @xmath115 , we can freely treat each integral as being over a local cartesian coordinate system , in which case @xmath3 is the ordinary cartesian jacobian matrix .",
    "now , we use two facts .",
    "first , we know @xmath119 .",
    "second , similar to sec .",
    "[ sec : thickness ] , @xmath120 from general properties of singular values  @xcite . combining these two inequalities",
    ", we find @xmath121 .",
    "substituting this bound into the integral above , we finally obtain : @xmath122 the desired inequality .",
    "( note that if the object contains corners where @xmath104 is not locally flat , that does not affect this analysis since those corner regions have zero measure in the integral .",
    "the bounds on @xmath3 mean that corners in @xmath108 must be mapped to corners in @xmath104 and vice versa , and the integrand is finite . )",
    "we suspect that a tighter bound , proportional to @xmath17 instead of @xmath123 , can be proved by taking into account the fact that the coordinate transformation must leave @xmath9 invariant . in the spherically symmetrical example",
    "above , the purely radial nature of the coordinate transformation caused it to have at most one factor of @xmath124 in @xmath22 ( only one eigenvalue of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vanishes for @xmath93 ) and not two , leading to an @xmath125 dependence .",
    "a similar single factor of @xmath17 in the general case would give a @xmath124 scaling in the inequalities above by replacing @xmath126 with @xmath52 .",
    "a simple linear scaling of the cloak volume , as mentioned at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : thickness ] , follows immediately from the bounds on @xmath22 : @xmath127 as for ground - plane cloaking , we can define a mean thickness @xmath128 of the cloak . for a useful cloak , @xmath129 and hence @xmath130 .",
    "thus , @xmath131 is a mean total ( cloak + object ) diameter .",
    "therefore , we have just demonstrated the inequality @xmath132 ( to lowest order in @xmath133 ) , which means that the mean cloak thickness @xmath128 must scale proportional to the object diameter .",
    "the spherical pendry example above leads us to suspect that a tighter bound @xmath134 can be derived .",
    "similar to the ground - plane example in sec .",
    "[ sec : thickness ] , we expect that the key point is that we have not yet taken into account the constraint @xmath135 on the cloaking transformation .",
    "however , our main goal here is to demonstrate the scaling of cloak thickness with object thickness , not to fine - tune the constant factor .",
    "now that we know that cloak thickness must scale with object thickness , an analysis of losses similar to that in the ground - plane case above must apply . as the object becomes thicker",
    ", incident rays travel for a longer distance through the cloak , and hence for a fixed tolerance on the cross section the losses per unit distance must shrink proportional to the object diameter .",
    "hence absorption losses ( or rather , the _ difference _ between the cloak absorption in @xmath5 and the absorption of the ambient medium ) and imperfections must scale inversely with the diameter .",
    "as we pointed out in our previous paper  @xcite , precisely such an inverse scaling of absorption tolerance with diameter has been demonstrated numerically  @xcite for spherical cloaks , and our work now shows that this relationship is general . as suggested by some authors  @xcite , gain could be used to compensate for absorption ( but not disorder ) , but as discussed above our results imply that this compensation must become more and more exact as the object diameter increases .    for example",
    ", let us explicitly consider absorption imperfections for the idealized case of @xmath99 : that is , suppose we are able to map @xmath10 to a single point @xmath136 , but have a finite @xmath16 and are still concerned with imperfect materials . in this case",
    ", an incident planewave of amplitude @xmath44 corresponds to a planewave of constant amplitude in the cloak for perfect materials , or to lowest order in the imperfections for imperfect materials .",
    "then , similar to our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorption ] , the change in absorbed power is bounded below by @xmath137 .",
    "since we require that this change also be bounded above by the incident intensity ( @xmath138 ) multiplied by some fraction @xmath18 of the geometric cross - section @xmath19 , we obtain a necessary condition on the absorption imperfection as in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorption ] .",
    "in particular it follows that an averaged absorption imperfection @xmath139 must scale proportional to @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is proportional to the diameter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : absorption ] , we further used @xmath142 and pulled out a @xmath123 factor , but that is not appropriate when @xmath99 , so instead we must leave a @xmath143 weight factor ( which is only zero at the inner surface of the cloak ) in the average of @xmath53 . as in sec .  [",
    "sec : absorption ] , this is not a sufficient condition because the observer need not use planewaves  for interrogating the cloak with a focused beam , a stronger condition must apply , in which @xmath53 within a small ( wavelength - scale ) volume must go to zero as diameter increases . if @xmath98 , this analysis is only slightly modified in principle ( although the precise expression becomes much more complicated ) : the small scattered field ( assuming @xmath144 ) from the nonzero @xmath145 modifies the field in @xmath5 by a small amount over most of @xmath45 ( except immediately adjacent to @xmath83 ) , which should only change the proportionality of the @xmath146 scaling by a small factor .",
    "generalizing our previous work  @xcite , these scaling laws point to an inherent practical difficulty ( though not a mathematical impossibility ) in scaling experimental cloaking of small objects to larger ones .",
    "furthermore , we showed that very similar analysis can be applied to cloaking of isolated objects  bounded index contrasts will imply a bounded reduction in the scattering cross section , a cloak thickness proportional to the object diameter , and imperfection tolerances that shrink with the object diameter ( a scaling we already observed numerically  @xcite ) .",
    "it might be possible to further generalize the results in this paper to cloaks that are not derived from coordinate transformations ( similar to the generality of our one - dimensional analysis  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the most serious constraint on isolated - object cloaking seems to be the bandwidth , which must be zero for perfect cloaking  @xcite . clearly ,",
    "if perfect cloaking is possible ( theoretically ) at a single frequency , then imperfect cloaking ( reduction of the cross section by a given factor ) must persist over a nonzero bandwidth , and an interesting open problem is to prove how the bandwidth of such imperfect isolated - object cloaking must scale with the object diameter from causality constraints .    an alternative direction is to consider relaxations of the cloaking problem that might prove more practical . in particular",
    ", it would be valuable to make precise the intuition that the cloaking problem becomes easier if the incident waves are restricted ( e.g. to planewaves from a certain range of angles ) and/or the observer is limited ( e.g. only scattered waves at certain angles are visible , or only amplitude but not phase can be detected ) , since this is arguably the situation in most experiments .",
    "( for example , current `` stealth '' aircraft are designed in the radar regime mainly to reduce back - scattering only  @xcite . )",
