    "in @xcite a model was presented for the production of a grb in a close neutron star binary system , near its last stable orbit . in that model",
    "the stars undergo compression due to non - linear general relativistic effects .",
    "vortices and shocks within the stars will convert this compressional energy into thermal energy which will be radiated from the stars in neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos emerging from the neutron stars will partially recombine via @xmath3 , an effect that is substantially augmented ( up to 30 times ) by bending of neutrino paths by strong gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "thus an @xmath1 pair plasma fireball emerges from the neutron stars and expands relativistically .",
    "a key parameter studied in @xcite was the entropy per baryon , @xmath4 , of the plasma , representing the amount of baryons entrained in the @xmath1 fireball .",
    "ita was found through 1d relativistic hydrodynamic simulations that if @xmath5 , then prompt gamma - ray emission would result from the eventual recombination of @xmath6 .",
    "if the entropy is as low as @xmath7 , effectively all of the energy would be transferred as kinetic energy to the baryons , thus resulting in gamma - ray emission from an external shock as the relativistic baryons sweep into the interstellar medium .",
    "each scenario was studied in detail in @xcite .    in the current work",
    "we employ three enhancements .",
    "the first is from recent refined simulations of the compression by wilson & mathews which show timescales @xmath8 second , thus this model is best suited to describe the short class of grbs ( < second ) .",
    "second , we use new calculations by @xcite of the @xmath9 between the neutrons stars where each neutrino of the annihilation pair originates from each star .",
    "this effect is found to be of about the same importance as that of the previously considered annihilation from individual netron stars @xcite .",
    "thus we have a new source of baryon - free @xmath1 plasma between the neutron stars .",
    "third , we implement fully relativistic 3d hydrodynamics to model the plasma expansion in the complex , rotating inter - star environment .",
    "in this model we estimate that 10% of the binding energy of a neutron star ( @xmath0 ergs ) is converted to thermal energy via compression , vortices and shocks .",
    "this @xmath10 ergs of energy is released as a monotonically increasing luminosity of neutrinos over a timescale of order @xmath11 second as found by calculations of j.  r.  wilson & g.  j.  mathews .",
    "this neutrino luminosity @xmath12 ergs sec@xmath13 annihilates into an @xmath1 pair plasma .",
    "annihilation of high neutrino luminosities in the strong gravitational field of the neutron stars can have high efficiencies ; near unity @xcite .",
    "about half of the pair plasma energy is deposited uniformly around the neutron stars due to single star neutrino annihilation @xcite ( figure [ contourplot ] ) and the other half is deposited between the stars due to interstar neutrino annihilation @xcite .    ]",
    "this plasma deposition morphology then becomes input for the 3d relativistic hydrodynamic code , which calculates the expansion of the plasma ( figure [ plot3d ] ) .",
    "these simulations show a plasma of very high entropy expanding out along the plane of symmetry between the neutron stars . in the regions around the stars",
    "lower entropy plasma is formed because a baryon wind is blown from the stars .",
    "ergs / sec of energy in @xmath1 pair plasma and about 1 % equivalent mass in baryons .",
    "the contour map , with right star cutaway , is of baryon density .",
    "the vector field is the 3-velocity of expanding plasma .",
    "this problem settles down to a static flow after about one orbit with period @xmath14 second .",
    "[ plot3d ] ]    thus this model predicts a variety of bursts .",
    "viewed along the axis of rotation , a prompt quasi - thermal burst of duration @xmath11 second will result from the annihilation of fireball pairs .",
    "because of the dearth of baryons left over to sweep into the interstellar medium , we do not predict the existence of an afterglow .",
    "this agrees with preliminary searches of the data archives for short - burst afterglows , which appear to be missing @xcite .",
    "viewed far from the axis of rotation a very different burst results .",
    "the lower entropy means that there will not be a prompt burst from pair annihilation in the fireball .",
    "however , there will be a baryon wind sweeping into the interstellar medium .",
    "thus we expect a burst that decays into an afterglow as a power - law",
    ". this behavior will be made chaotic and complex by the rapid rotation of the binary system .",
    "in @xcite it was reported that neutron star binaries near their last stable orbit undergo a compression due to non - linear general relativistic ( gr ) effects .",
    "this effect could be strong enough to crush the stars to black holes and perhaps release binding energy as thermal neutrinos in the process . since that report",
    ", this effect has remained controversial .",
    "wilson recently has done a similar calculation of two stars gravitationally falling together without angular momentum .",
    "the calculations were done both in full gr and using the `` conformal flat approximation '' ( cfa ) , often cited by critics to be the spurious source of the compression effect .",
    "preliminary results , schematically shown in figure [ centraldensity ] , demonstrate a compression effect for both calculations .",
    "thus , not only is the cfa not the source of the compression , but perhaps the compression effect , here demonstrated in a non - rotating system , is more general than previously thought ."
