    "recent simulations have sought to determine which processes dominate in different types of galaxies .",
    "they have experimented with various levels and types of inflow , outflow , and feedback @xcite and tested a range of star formation laws @xcite to understand the roles that each may play in determining the gas and stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "observations , meanwhile , have focused on constraining the global distribution of cold gas in the local universe and studying how the cold gas content of galaxies is related to their evolution and growth .",
    "attempts to observationally describe the distribution of galaxies in terms of their atomic gas content include hi surveys of large samples of galaxies or large areas of the sky @xcite and have often relied on the measurement of hi mass functions @xcite .",
    "hi mass functions ( himfs ) estimate the space density of galaxies as a function of hi mass and",
    "are generally parametrized by a schechter function @xcite .",
    "the himf can shed light on many aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "comparisons of himfs derived from galaxies in different environments and across morphological types provide insight into the processes of gas stripping and accretion @xcite .",
    "the himf also provides a constraint for models of galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another motivation for constructing himfs was to examine the low - mass end of the himf for evidence of a population of  dark \" galaxies with no optical counterparts , so - called  missing satellites \" @xcite .",
    "early himfs were , by necessity , derived from relatively small samples of galaxies , sometimes as small as @xmath1760 , observed as part of shallow surveys .",
    "much larger and deeper surveys have yielded samples of thousands of galaxies that better constrain the himf and can map the large - scale structure of the local universe @xcite . remarkably , the shape of the himf has not changed significantly since the first himfs based on fewer galaxies .",
    "the large samples have , however , facilitated more complex analyses of the hi content of galaxies including the relation between hi and optical- and uv - derived properties such as stellar mass , color , and sfr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bivariate mass functions @xcite .    despite the utility of the himf , few studies have sought to explain the physical mechanisms that can shape the full distribution .",
    "the himf is also hard to interpret in an evolutionary context  the origin of hi in galaxies and its evolution over time are presently quite challenging to model . like the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy ,",
    "hi content may increase or decrease as gas is accreted , converted to stars , cooled , ionized or heated .",
    "this contrasts with the monotonic growth history that generally characterizes the stellar mass of galaxies . in this respect",
    "it is natural to study the hi content of galaxies by adopting the same approach as has been used for studying the distribution and evolution of sfr vs. stellar mass in galaxies , using the _ bivariate _ distribution , as in the color - magnitude diagram and the specific sfr - stellar mass plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus we construct the bivariate @xmath18-@xmath19 himf , which we call the hismf and which describes the space density of galaxies in terms of both hi mass and stellar mass .",
    "this type of hi study necessarily assumes that all hi - detected galaxies are optically detected and benefits from samples that are complete in stellar mass .",
    "this strategy is behind the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which serves as the basis of this work and is described in detail in the next section .",
    "in this paper we use data from gass to construct the hismf for massive ( log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 @xmath3 10 ) galaxies , @xmath20(m@xmath21 , m@xmath22 ) .",
    "a key difference between this work and previous work is that we are working with a stellar mass - complete sample of galaxies , each of which has either an hi detection or upper limit .",
    "the detections and upper limits can be used to constrain the full hismf .",
    "we conduct the analysis by using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) routine to fit a schechter @xcite function and a log - normal function , and two variations of each , to the distribution of hi masses in six stellar mass bins from log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 = 10 to log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 = 11.5 .",
    "this allows us to examine for the first time how the himf varies with stellar mass in a large statistical and unbiased sample of local galaxies .",
    "in addition to the binned hismf , we also derive continuous bivariate ( m@xmath21 , m@xmath22 ) and trivariate ( m@xmath21 , m@xmath22 , sfr ) himfs .",
    "these functions drive our discussion of the processes shaping the distribution of hi masses with respect to stellar mass . to demonstrate the utility of the hismf in testing simulations and observational prescriptions , we compare it to the hismfs derived from published photometric gas fraction relations , which provide estimates of hi content based on photometrically derived quantities .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to develop a simple parametrization of the hismf that provides an accurate and complete description for model comparison , and that also allows some physical interpretation of its form .",
    "recent theoretical models have already begun to predict the himf and interpret the physical mechanisms behind it @xcite .",
    "our hismf should be an important constraint for future models and will complement other recent studies seeking to build a global census of baryons in and around galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data and in section 3 we describe our methodology for deriving the hismf for massive galaxies .",
    "we present the hismf in section 4 . in section 5 we interpret the shape of the hismf in light of the trivariate fit , and in section 6 we summarize our findings .",
    "the appendix contains a comparison of our derived hismf to the hismf based on photometric gas fractions and an analysis of the hismf with different assumed stellar mass functions .",

    "gass is unique for its sample selection and observing strategy . from a parent sample of 12006 galaxies ,",
    "the arecibo targets were selected to yield a relatively flat distribution across stellar mass , ensuring uniform statistics throughout the entire stellar mass range .",
    "our final volume statistics are determined by adopting an assumed stellar mass function .",

    "since the targeted gass sample is complete in each stellar mass bin ( the sample was selected in an unbiased way , making it representative of the true distribution of galaxies in the local universe ) , non - detections provide an accurate measure of the number of galaxies with gas fractions below the imposed limit .    the sample we use is based on gass data release 2 ( dr2 ) and is identical to that described in @xcite .",

    "we found that the distribution of hi masses is nearly identical if we remove these potentially confused galaxies from the sample so we choose to keep them in our analysis ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we rely on several derived quantities including the gas fraction , specific sfr , and concentration index for gass galaxies .",

    "the functional forms are compiled in table [ tbl : models ] . the schechter function ( eq . 1 in table [ tbl : models ] ) is composed of a power law that describes the distribution of low - mass galaxies and an exponential that describes the distribution of high - mass galaxies .",
    "a schematic of the schechter function is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] in bold .",
    "the power law at low hi masses ( @xmath8 ) characterizes an extended tail of galaxies with small amounts of hi ; the exponential at high hi masses above @xmath42 shows that the number of hi - rich galaxies drops off sharply above a given hi mass .",
    "the schechter function nicely fits the one - dimensional himf derived from surveys with high numbers of hi - poor galaxies @xcite .",
    "however it is not apparent that the hi distribution at a given stellar mass should also be characterized by a simple power law at the hi - poor end . in particular , for a survey such as gass in which the tail of the distribution is dominated by non - detections below the gas fraction limit , the shape of the distribution of low - hi - mass galaxies is not well constrained . though upper limits provide some information about the total number of galaxies with low hi masses , we do not want upper limits to strongly constrain the shape of the function below @xmath42 .    to account for this issue",
    ", we introduce two versions of a truncated schechter function that do not extend to low hi masses . in both cases",
    "the function is a combination of a schechter function at relatively high hi masses and a constant distribution at low hi masses .",
    "we do not necessarily expect the true distribution of hi - poor galaxies to be flat , but we choose a flat distribution for simplicity and because we have no way of determining from gass what the true distribution is where the sample is dominated by upper limits .",
    "the flat distribution at low hi masses reflects the fact that while we choose not to use the gass sample to put constraints on the shape of the hismf in this range , we can use it to derive the total number of galaxies expected to have low hi masses .    the choice of where to impose the break in the schechter function is somewhat arbitrary ( its precise location does not significantly affect the parameters of the fit ) .",
    "for simplicity we have elected to set it at a constant gas fraction with respect to stellar mass to match our observational limits .",
    "we set m@xmath29 equal to 1% of the central stellar mass in each mass bin :    @xmath43    which is just below the gas fraction detection threshold for gass . with this choice ,",
    "most hi detections are above m@xmath29 and upper limits tend to cluster around m@xmath29 .",

    "the function is parametrized according to eq . 2 in table [ tbl : models ] .",
    "we call this a broken schechter function .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 and m@xmath44 , we fit another parameter , @xmath10 , defined as the fraction of galaxies in a given stellar mass bin with hi masses above the cutoff :    @xmath45    because of our treatment of upper limits ( see below ) , all upper limits contribute to the estimate of the number of galaxies below m@xmath29 even if the value of the upper limit is greater than m@xmath29 .",
    "@xmath46 is derived so that the balance of galaxies expected to reside below m@xmath29 are uniformly contained within a range of hi masses extending up to m@xmath29 .",
    "all functions are normalized to match the @xcite stellar mass function .",
    "we must be careful to properly define the hi mass range within which we derive the hismf .",
    "the low hi mass cutoff impacts the probability for non - detections ( see below ) and the normalization of the hismf .",
    "the chosen lower limit should reflect the minimum hi mass expected to be associated with a galaxy of a given stellar mass , whether or not it is detectable by gass .",
    "we adopt a lower limit of log m@xmath47 = log m@xmath48 - 4.0 ( an hi mass four dex smaller than the central stellar mass of each bin ) .",
    "this limit is suggested by ly@xmath8 absorber measurements in @xcite showing that early - type and spiral galaxies in a mass range similar to that for gass are likely to have the same minimum amount of hi in their cgm , which they give as approximately log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath17 6.0 and scales with galactic surface area .",
    "this value is also generally consistent with upper limits for the least hi - rich galaxies in @xcite .",
    "we set the high hi mass limit to be log m@xmath21 = 12.0 ; choosing a slightly higher or lower value would negligibly affect our results .",
    "the two main differences between the broken schechter and the full schechter are that the broken schechter is discontinuous and potentially multipeaked",

    ", we examine the dependence of the himf on stellar mass and sfr by introducing a hierarchical model in which we redefine the distribution function parameters in terms of these physical quantities .",

    "for galaxies with log sfr / m@xmath22 @xmath4 -12 , we redefined their sfrs as a function of stellar mass only :    @xmath57    and substituted this equation for log sfr in the parametrizations in table [ tbl : otherfits ] .",

    "each row represents a stellar mass range from log m@xmath1 = 10.0 to log m@xmath1 = 11.5 ; the stellar mass interval is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel .",
    "the best - fit parameters and their 1@xmath68 uncertainties determined from the mcmc fit are listed in table [ tbl : schechter ] .",
    "1@xmath68 uncertainties on the fit for each hi mass bin are also reflected in the shaded regions surrounding each curve and were determined by computing @xmath20(m@xmath21 ,",

    "first we examine qualitatively how the hismf varies with stellar mass and from model to model .",
    "overall there is remarkable similarity between the hismf at different stellar masses and for different parametrizations of the schechter function .",
    "the main difference with respect to stellar mass is that the hismf reflects the stellar mass function , which decreases with stellar mass .",
    "because fewer galaxies are used to fit the models at high stellar masses and the fraction of non - detections increases , the error bars generally widen with stellar mass . though the shape of the functions is close to invariant with respect to stellar mass , galaxies in the range 10.5 @xmath4 log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 @xmath4 11.0 tend to have higher values of @xmath8 , which makes the slope of the biariate himf for moderate hi masses steeper , and slightly smaller values for m@xmath6 , so the function cuts off at lower hi masses .",
    "we also find that the shape of the hismf is largely independent of the parametrization used .",
    "though the two pieces of the broken schechter function are not required to match as they are in the bent function , they almost do , such that the broken schechter function closely resembles the bent schechter function . in this case , the constraint on the bent schechter function does not seem to bias the fit .",
    "( we will show an example later in which it does . )",
    "moreover , the calculated space density for galaxies below m@xmath29 is very similar for the broken and bent cases , showing that the two parametrizations consistently identify a similar fraction of galaxies with a gas fraction above 1% .",
    "one of the main differences among the three parametrizations is that the error bars for the broken function in the region described by @xmath8 are significantly larger .",
    "it is reasonable for the error bars to be larger here because there are few detections in this narrow range of hi masses contributing to the estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "thus the small error bars for the bent schechter functions perhaps indicate that the constraint that the entire function be continuous does affect @xmath8 for the bent schechter function .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : lognormal ] we present the results of the three log - normal fits to the data .",
    "the best - fit parameters and associated uncertainties are listed in table [ tbl : logn ] .",
    "because the log - normal function is symmetric , it predicts a much higher space density of galaxies at high hi masses than does the schechter function .",
    "the three variations of the log - normal functions are similar to the three schechter functions in that the fits are largely independent of stellar mass except for what was noted above for galaxies with intermediate stellar masses .    a closer look at the fits for the highest stellar mass bin ( 11.25 @xmath4 log m@xmath22/m@xmath2 @xmath4 11.5 ) reveals that they do not exhibit the same shape as do the fits at lower stellar masses .",
    "moreover , the size of the error regions indicates that these fits are not well constrained ( see also reported errors in tables [ tbl : schechter ] and [ tbl : logn ] and plots below ) .",
    "these results can be attributed to the small number of galaxies in this stellar mass bin , a number that is less than a third of the number of galaxies in the other stellar mass bins ( table [ tbl : numbers ] ) despite attempts to maintain a flat stellar mass distribution for the gass sample .",
    "we choose to keep this stellar mass bin in our analysis to show where our ability to accurately describe the shape of the hismf breaks down .",
    "more observations at higher stellar masses ( and the final gass data release , catinella et al . , mnras submitted ) will be necessary to understand how the hismf changes for the most massive galaxies in the local universe .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : params ] and [ fig : params2 ] we quantitatively examine how the best - fit schechter and log - normal parameters vary with stellar mass .",

    "the broken and bent schechter models produce @xmath8 s that range between 0.5 and 1.2 with no obvious trend with stellar mass .",

    "can be derived from the results of the bent model .",
    "the effective @xmath10 for the bent fit and @xmath10 for the broken fit track each other nicely , confirming that the fits yield similar hismfs .",
    "( as an additional check they are also comparable to the observed detection fractions reported in @xcite . ) both models show that the fraction of galaxies with gas fractions above 1% decreases with stellar mass . as another way of comparing the three schechter functions , in the bottom panel we show m@xmath84 for each of the three fits , where m@xmath84 is the hi mass in each stellar mass bin below which lie 75% of the galaxies in that stellar mass bin .",
    "the broken and bent schechter functions yield values for m@xmath84 that are nearly identical .",
    "the values for the full schechter function are similar to those of the truncated schechter functions but diverge slightly from them at high stellar masses .",
    "[ fig : params2 ] shows a similar analysis of the parameters of the log - normal fits .",
    "the trends for m@xmath84 and @xmath10 vs. stellar mass are similar to those for the schechter functions .",
    "@xmath49 , which is related to m@xmath6 for the schechter fit , does not show an obvious correlation with stellar mass .",
    "@xmath68 , which measures the width of the distribution , decreases slightly with stellar mass from about 0.6 to 0.4 .",
    "next we wish to examine the relationship between the model parameters to uncover any covariance . as an example",
    ", we do this for the broken and bent schechter fits in fig . [",
    "fig : contours ] .",
    "each row shows a different stellar mass bin corresponding to the six rows in fig .",
    "[ fig : schechter ] . in each panel",
    "we show the error contours associated with two parameters for both functions .",

    "the tilt in the contours for @xmath8 vs. m@xmath6 shows that the two schechter parameters for the broken and bent schechter functions exhibit some covariance along the direction in which they are anti - correlated . a high @xmath8 and a low m@xmath6 could describe the distribution just as well as a low @xmath8 and a high m@xmath6 .",
    "we comment on the origin of this covariance in section [ sec : otherfits ] .",
    "the narrower contours for the bent fit show that @xmath8 is more tightly constrained by the model , likely because of the requirement that the schechter function smoothly connect to the flat part of the function at m@xmath29 .",
    "though there are some noticeable differences between the two fits at high stellar masses , the contours for the two fits generally overlap across the entire stellar mass range , indicating that any difference between the two model fits is small compared to the errors in the parameters .",
    "the middle column shows the relationship between m@xmath6 and @xmath10 and the right column shows @xmath10 vs. @xmath8 . for the bent fit",
    "we only show the effective @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the broken fit yields a tight constraint on @xmath10 , which is not surprising since the gass survey is designed to provide an accurate measure of this quantity .",
    "we also find that there is little obvious covariance between f and @xmath8 .",
    "an important distinction between the two classes of models considered above ( schechter vs. log - normal ) is the shape of the function at high hi masses .",
    "here we explore two questions : 1 ) whether gass includes sufficient numbers of hi - rich galaxies to provide a strong constraint on the function at the hi - rich end and 2 ) whether we can favor one class of model over the other based on the success of our fits . to test these questions we first conduct an analysis that makes use of an enlarged sample of hi - rich galaxies obtained using the alfalfa survey .",
    "we then use the sum of each model across stellar masses to provide sufficient signal to allow us to distinguish between model classes .",
    "gass was designed to sensitively detect hi in massive hi - poor galaxies but does not detect as many hi - rich galaxies as do other shallower blind surveys with significant sky coverage , such as alfalfa @xcite .",
    "when complete , alfalfa will have scanned over 7000 square degrees of the sky , so the number of alfalfa detections in the gass stellar mass range exceeds the number of gass detections .",
    "we refine the measurement of the hismf at high hi masses by including in the fits detections and upper limits from the alfalfa survey .",
    "the alfalfa sample we use includes all galaxies in the gass parent sample that lie in the regions of the sky already observed and cataloged by alfalfa as of the @xmath8.40 release @xcite . in this region",
    "1102 galaxies were detected by alfalfa and 3443 were not detected ( see table [ tbl : numbers ] ) .",
    "we calculate upper limits for the non - detections by using the alfalfa integrated flux limit , s@xmath85 in jy km s@xmath86 , from @xcite .",
    "s@xmath85 depends on the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and velocity width ( w@xmath25 ) of the hi line :    @xmath87    we let s / n = 5.0 and w@xmath25 = 300 km @xmath88 to be consistent with the calculation of upper limits for gass .",
    "@xcite calculate hi masses according to :    @xmath89    thus , the upper limits we calculate for alfalfa non - detections are simply a function of distance :    @xmath90    to derive the hismf that accounts for the gass and alfalfa surveys together we simply add the log likelihoods for the galaxies in each sample .",
    "( we checked with our simulation that applying different weights to each sample does not significantly affect the result . ) as we mentioned above , the log likelihoods include the error on each hi measurement .",
    "we derive errors for the alfalfa detections in the same way we did for gass .",
    "we also set the error for alfalfa upper limits to 0.3 dex .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfalfa ] we present the alfalfa data and the results of the joint fit to gass and alfalfa .",
    "we show the alfalfa data in the same way we show the gass data : detections are shown as solid symbols and the full sample including upper limits is shown as open symbols .",
    "the alfalfa data generally extend to higher hi masses ( log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath91 10.5 ) than the gass data , which end at log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath17 10.25 in most stellar mass bins . though alfalfa provides better coverage of the hi - rich end of the himf , the small number of galaxies detected by alfalfa below log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath17 10.0 emphasizes the need for deeper surveys such as gass that can provide hi measurements of massive galaxies with smaller amounts of hi .",
    "[ fig : alfalfa ] compares the gass broken schechter fit to the bent and broken versions of the gass + alfalfa fit .",
    "first we will examine the hi - rich end of the hismf .",
    "in general both variations of the gass+alfalfa fits predict slightly fewer hi - rich galaxies at low stellar masses and slightly more hi - rich galaxies at high stellar masses .",
    "the major difference between the two fits is in the range 10.75 @xmath4 log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 @xmath4 11.0 , where the gass+alfalfa fit extends to higher hi masses .",
    "we noted previously that the gass fits in this mass range predicted surprisingly low space densities .",
    "the gass+alfalfa fits are more consistent with respect to stellar mass , perhaps making up for small anomalies in the gass sample .",
    "though the fits in this mass range argue that alfalfa data are necessary to properly describe the hi - rich end of the hismf , we see this mass range as an exception rather than the rule",
    ". we will show later that a continuous fit applied to only gass data is able to account for the anomaly in the stellar mass bin 10.75 @xmath4 log m@xmath1/m@xmath2 @xmath4 11.0 without including alfalfa galaxies .",
    "thus , the binned fit , rather than the use of only gass data , is the cause of the discrepancy in this stellar mass bin .    at lower hi masses ,",
    "the broken and bent gass+alfalfa fits vary significantly .",
    "the broken schechter fit exhibits a steep slope down to m@xmath29 while the constraints of the bent schechter fit cause the slope to be much shallower .",
    "the significant difference between @xmath8 for the bent and broken fits with alfalfa contrasts with the relative similarity between @xmath8 for the bent and broken fits to gass data only .",
    "it is likely that the lack of alfalfa data at low hi masses had too much influence on the fit here , biasing the broken fit to predict low numbers of galaxies within this hi mass range .",
    "for ease of analysis and because we have shown the gass sample to provide a sufficient estimate of the hismf at high hi masses , we do not include alfalfa in each of our subsequent fits .",
    "future work may continue to explore the combined use of gass and alfalfa .",
    "we have produced six fits to the hismf based on six different models and we wish to select which is the best match to the data . to distinguish between the models quantitatively we calculated several parameters that are commonly used to assess goodness - of - fit or for model selection .",
    "we list these numbers in the appendix and briefly discuss them here .",
    "they include the probabilities calculated in the mcmc runs , the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the poisson probabilities , and the @xmath92 statistic .    in table",
    "[ tbl : prob ] we list the mcmc probabilities and bayesian information criterion for each model and each stellar mass bin .",
    "both measures of the probabilities are in the same range for each stellar mass bin and do not strongly favor one model over the others .",
    "we can examine the qualitative differences among the six models in two ways : by comparing the integrated model hismfs , which emphasize deviations from the data , and by considering the limitations of each model that are not quantifiable .",
    "we derive the total hismf for massive galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] ) by summing the hismf across all stellar mass bins for each model . because m@xmath29 varies with stellar mass and",
    "the total hismf is a sum over all stellar mass bins , the total hismfs for the broken and bent fits do not have the same characteristic flat regions at low hi masses . at the lowest hi masses",
    "the shape of the hismf is still poorly constrained by our data .",
    "first we examine the differences between the schechter functions and log - normal functions , which are shown separately in the panels on the left and right .",
    "though the schechter and log - normal functions predict a similar number of galaxies at low hi masses , each of the three log - normal fits systematically predicts more galaxies at high hi masses than do the three schechter fits .",
    "the space densities they predict are well above the data points and their error bars . based on this discrepancy between the data and the log - normal fits to the data",
    ", we can safely conclude that the schechter function s steeper dropoff at high hi masses makes it a better approximation of the true hismf    to test this conclusion we quantitatively compare the predictions of the six models to the data by calculating the @xmath92 statistic and the poisson probability for hi masses above log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 = 10 .",
    "these numbers ( see table [ tbl : probtot ] ) confirm that the schechter function is a much better description of the data at high hi masses .",
    "@xcite conducted a test similar to ours by comparing schechter and gaussian fits to the total himf derived from 934 giant spirals in an hi flux limited sample .",
    "they found that the gaussian and schechter fits describe the full sample and the sample divided by morphology equally well .",
    "they note that discrepancies between the two fits occur at low ( log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath4 9.0 ) and high ( log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath3 10.5 ) hi masses .",
    "it is in these hi mass ranges where we also find the greatest discrepancy between the two fits .",
    "we can not favor one version of the schechter fit over another based on their total hismfs because they are virtually identical , which table [ tbl : probtot ] confirms .",
    "instead it is important to consider the limitations inherent to each model .",
    "upper limits can significantly affect the slopes of the full schechter and log - normal models at moderate hi masses .",
    "the break in the broken and bent models allows us to use upper limits to estimate the space density of galaxies with low hi fractions while not allowing upper limits to dictate the shape of the function .",
    "a limitation of the bent model is that the two sections of the function are required to meet .",
    "this requirement seems reasonable because a true disconnect in a mass function ( such as in the broken model ) does not make physical sense .",

    "an alternative explanation for the constant m@xmath6 - that hi masses of galaxies vary in unpredictable ways as they evolve but that the distribution of hi masses is somehow maintained - is unlikely .",
    "thus , our results support a scenario in which the processes that contribute to and deplete the hi content of a galaxy conspire to maintain an equilibrium hi mass .",

    "@xmath8 increases with both stellar mass and sfr causing samples with massive galaxies and with highly star - forming galaxies to have peaked distributions of hi masses . assuming that high sfrs are in part driven by the presence of large amounts of cold gas",

    "the hismf is flat or has a slowly decreasing slope at moderate hi masses when galaxies with low stellar masses or low sfrs comprise the population .",
    "the different distributions of hi masses at various sfrs has implications for the relationship between hi and star formation .",
    "galaxies with low sfrs can have a wide range of hi masses while highly star - forming galaxies are more likely to have a high hi mass .",
    "this was also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : triptych ] .",
    "thus , galaxies with low sfrs do not have a well - defined relationship between hi and star formation while galaxies with high sfrs exhibit a much tighter relationship between hi and star formation .",
    "the positive correlation between @xmath8 and stellar mass for the bivariate and trivariate fits shows that hi masses are more strongly peaked among samples of massive galaxies independent of their sfrs .",
    "this trend shows that at high stellar masses galaxies tend to have higher hi masses as well .",
    "although there does not exist an observational hismf for comparison , we can look to @xcite , who found that the himf depends on morphology .",
    "in particular , they noted that the hi - poor end of the himf is close to flat ( or @xmath8 is close to zero using our convention ) when only early - type spirals are considered .",
    "the himf for later - type spirals rises towards lower hi masses ( @xmath8 is smaller and negative ) .",
    "we find that the hismf rises towards lower hi masses for galaxies with lower stellar masses .",
    "since later - type galaxies have , on average , lower stellar masses than early - type galaxies , it is likely that the same relationship between hi mass , stellar mass , and morphology is driving both of these trends .",
    "there are two aspects of the hi - poor end of the hismf that must be examined : the number of galaxies ( or fraction of galaxies with a given stellar mass ) that have a low gas fraction and the distribution of these galaxies with respect to hi mass .",
    "we quantified the former with @xmath108 and found that the fraction of galaxies with hi gas fractions less than 1% increases with stellar mass .",
    "if we assume that all galaxies are undergoing infall proportional to their halo masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) then we must identify the processes that remove gas from galaxies to understand what sets @xmath108 and why it changes with stellar mass .",
    "these processes likely include agn feedback , which heats gas in the disk and surrounding halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , environmental effects that deplete gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and stellar - driven winds that expel gas from galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gass sample does not include many galaxies in dense environments so we ignore the effect of environment here , though we note that the stripping of gas can have a significant effect on galaxies in clusters .",
    "likewise , stellar - driven winds do not remove large amounts of gas from massive galaxies because the gas can be reaccreted in the form of a galactic fountain @xcite .",
    "it is likely that these processes as well as star formation contribute to the hi - poor end of the hismf by removing some cold gas from galaxies or preventing gas from cooling .",
    "though simulations have shown that such processes can effectively remove cold gas from galaxies , they do not always predict the right number of hi - poor galaxies .",
    "@xcite predict the distribution of hi gas fractions as a function of stellar mass and find a negligible number of massive galaxies with gas fractions below 1% , in contrast to our hismf , which predicts that 20 - 50% of galaxies in this stellar mass range should have such low gas fractions .",
    "the precise distribution of massive galaxies with low gas fractions is unknown and we do not attempt to fit the distribution of hi masses below m@xmath29 , where the hi measurements are mostly upper limits . instead , we show the predicted space density of galaxies below a 1% gas fraction as a constant distribution with respect to stellar mass . here",
    "we discuss whether that decision makes sense physically .",
    "the distribution of galaxies at low hi masses depends , in part , on the ways in which galaxies with little or no hi reacquire small amounts of cold gas .",
    "if we assume that a given fraction of halo baryons cool onto the disk from the hot halo @xcite , then we might expect the distribution of hi masses to exhibit a peak at low hi masses that depends on halo mass . however , stochastic additions to the cold gas in the disk , such as from infalling satellites or stellar mass loss @xcite would likely smooth the distribution .",
    "there is some indication that galaxies are distributed uniformly at low hi masses .",
    "@xcite measure the hi masses and characterize the hi morphology of 166 early - type galaxies brighter than m@xmath109 = -21.5 .",
    "they find that galaxies with hi that they describe as  unsettled \" ( i.e. hi in streams or tails rather than an ordered disk ) can contain a wide range of hi masses from a few times 10@xmath110 to 10@xmath111 m@xmath2 whereas galaxies with settled hi disks tend to have higher hi masses . galaxies with",
    "unsettled hi might be accreting small amounts of cold gas episodically , such as from the halo @xcite or intergalactic medium @xcite , and might not have a preferred hi mass scale .",
    "@xcite derive an himf for early - type galaxies , which is relatively flat for 7 @xmath4 log m@xmath21/m@xmath2 @xmath4 9.5 , and an himf for spirals , which is sharply peaked and falls off sharply on either side of m@xmath6 . if late - type galaxies are the main contributors to the peak of the himf , as the @xcite results and our fig .",
    "[ fig : colorcut ] suggest , then it is possible that early - type galaxies , and others undergoing episodic gas acretion , contribute to a broad distribution of hi masses at the hi - poor end of the himf .",
    "but there is some evidence that the hismf for massive galaxies instead rises at low hi masses , making the hismf for massive galaxies bimodal .",
    "we already noted above that this trend is evident in the simulated himf for galaxies in bins of halo mass from @xcite .",
    "it is also reasonable to conjecture that the hismf might mimic the distribution of sfrs in bins of stellar mass .",
    "observations reveal that the distribution of sfrs has a star - forming sequence plus a tail towards passively evolving galaxies at a wide range of stellar masses @xcite and some simulations have begun to reproduce this distribution by varying star formation prescriptions @xcite . though it is difficult to make strong conclusions about the hi - poor end of the himf from surveys that are flux - limited , the @xcite himf for early - type galaxies reveals that the hi - poor end could slope upward if the hi in undetected galaxies is included . finally",
    ", the results from our trivariate fit show that at the lowest stellar masses and sfrs we probe , @xmath8 could become negative , indicating a possible peak at low - to - intermediate hi masses ( see bold line in fig .",

    "the schechter and log - normal parameters m@xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath49 , and @xmath68 show little variation with stellar mass , though @xmath10 , the fraction of galaxies with gas fractions above 1% , decreases from about 80% to 40% .",
    "the continuous bivariate fit shows that @xmath8 varies as m@xmath7 , m@xmath6 varies as m@xmath9 and @xmath10 varies as m@xmath11 .",
    "the continuous bivariate fit should be taken as our main result to compare to future observations and simulations .",
    "in particular , we believe that the change in @xmath10 with stellar mass will provide a strong constraint for simulations . * to test the accuracy of the models , we compare the total hismf for massive galaxies , constructed by summing the hismf across all stellar mass bins , to the data .",
    "this comparison shows that each variation of the log - normal function overestimates the number of hi - rich galaxies .",

    "the total hismf for massive galaxies is consistent with the alfalfa himf @xcite at high hi masses , indicating that the most hi - rich galaxies in the local universe are also massive in stars .",

    "the trivariate fit shows that @xmath8 varies as m@xmath15 and sfr@xmath16 . *",
    "we show that the peak at m@xmath6 is likely dominated by star - forming galaxies and that its slow variation with stellar mass could be related to the ways in which star - forming galaxies maintain an equilibrium hi mass . * the dependence of @xmath8 on sfr shows that highly star - forming galaxies tend to have a narrow range of hi masses peaked about a high hi mass whereas passively evolving galaxies can have a wider range of hi masses .",
    "the bivariate hi mass - stellar mass function provides a two - dimensional description of the ways in which hi mass and stellar mass are distributed among massive galaxies .",

    "@xcite show that photometric gas fractions derived from this equation exhibit less scatter when compared to measured hi masses .",
    "the hismf derived using the disk photometric gas fraction is the only photometric hismf that slightly overpredicts the number of hi - rich galaxies .",

    "there are several possible reasons why photometric gas fractions do not capture the details of the total hismf for massive galaxies .",
    "one explanation is that the small number of hi detections for hi - poor galaxies and the most massive galaxies hinders the ability to derive accurate photometric gas fraction relations across a wide range of hi masses .",

    "@xcite argue that a plane describing the relationship between gas fraction , color , and stellar mass surface density may not be appropriate for use with these galaxies because they do not exhibit the same linear trends between hi gas fraction and both color and stellar mass surface density as star - forming galaxies .",
    "this was also seen in @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that their photometric gas fractions reproduce the observed himf from @xcite if they only consider star - forming galaxies , but we showed in the previous section that bulge - dominated galaxies and red galaxies do contribute significantly to the hismf for massive galaxies at the hi - rich end .",

    "we showed that the shape of the hismf changes with stellar mass and sfr .",
    "thus , a single photometric gas fraction estimator that assumes a simple relationship between gas content and other physical quantities is not likely to be valid across a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "there is still work to be done in deriving photometric gas fraction relations that reproduce the true distribution of hi masses while also yielding accurate estimates of gas fractions for individual galaxies .",
