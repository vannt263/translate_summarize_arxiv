    "iras  19254 - 7245 , with an infrared luminosity @xmath1 ( calculated assuming @xmath2 , v=18479 @xmath3 and using all four iras fluxes melnick & mirabel 1990 ) , lies amongst the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) emitting most of their energy in the far infrared .",
    "more than 90% of these objects show evidence for disturbed morphologies and interaction ( e.g. sanders et al . 1988 ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; murphy et al .",
    "1996 ; clements et al .",
    "iras  19254 - 7245 is a particularly spectacular interacting galaxy with tidal tails extending to a distance of about 350  kpc and two bright nuclei 10  kpc apart . although it is widely accepted that this system results from the collision between two gas - rich spirals , a multiple - merger origin has been recently suggested from high - resolution hst observations showing that a double nucleus may be present in both components of the interaction ( borne et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the southern nucleus prevails in luminosity as the system is observed at longer wavelengths and it is the dominant source in the mid - infrared as shown by the isocam observations of charmandaris et al . ( 2002 ) .",
    "this nucleus also shows an optical spectrum typical of a seyfert 2 galaxy ( mirabel et al .",
    "the presence of strong nuclear activity is moreover indicated by the near - infrared ( nir ) and iras 25/60/f@xmath4 colors , which both suggest the presence of important thermal emission from hot dust ( @xmath5 300 - 500k ) most probably heated by the active nucleus .",
    "the system has been studied among others by mirabel et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and colina et al .",
    "both groups find broad emission lines in the optical with a complex profile that can be attributed to material falling onto the nucleus or to an outflow .",
    "the kinetic energy required to power such a flow may originate from stellar winds and/or supernovae .",
    "this strongly supports the picture of merger - driven starburst activity characterized by a high star formation rate ( @xmath5 150 m@xmath6yr@xmath7 , colina et al .",
    "1991 ) , taking place in the seyfert circumnuclear region .    understanding the true origin of the ultra - luminous phase in infrared galaxies is still an open debate .",
    "recent studies have shown that the merger - stage in interacting systems , traced by the projected separation of the nuclei , correlates with the star - forming efficiency and with the molecular mass detected in each merger ( gao & solomon 1999 ; murphy et al .",
    "however the relative importance between starbursting and agn activity in luminous galaxies , and ulirgs in particular , is still an open issue ( sanders & mirabel 1996 , lutz et al .",
    "1996 , vignati et al .",
    "1999 ) . harboring both a seyfert and a starburst components , iras",
    "19254 - 7245 is a very interesting object within this context .",
    "the separation between the two nuclei involved in this merger is still large enough to allow a careful analysis and distinguish between the two sources .",
    "our main goal is to study the near infrared ( nir ) spectrum of this galaxy , but optical and @xmath8 data were also obtained .    the present paper is divided in three main sections : observations , analysis and discussion . in @xmath9",
    "2 we present the data describing how they were obtained and reduced . in @xmath9",
    "3 we present the analysis of the data and how the main physical parameters were derived from the observations . in @xmath9  4 we use these parameters to describe the physical conditions in the galaxy . finally we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we obtained low and medium resolution spectra of iras  19254 - 7245 at optical wavelengths .",
    "the low resolution spectrum was observed with the boller & chivens spectrograph at the eso 1.52 m telescope at la silla in 1999 may using grating # 23 and a 2-wide slit to yield a spectral resolution of r=1300 in the range 4400 - 7400 .",
    "the position angle was 12 , which allows to include both nuclei in the slit .",
    "the total integration time was 40 min .",
    "the 1d spectrum of the southern component extracted with an aperture of 2.6 corresponding to 3.1 kpc at a distance of 247 mpc , is shown in fig.[eso ] .",
    "the medium resolution spectrum was acquired with emmi at the eso - ntt in 1999 july using the remd ( red medium dispersion ) mode and grating @xmath106 which gives a resolution r=5500 in the band 6600 - 7200 .",
    "two exposures of 15 and 30 minutes were taken using a 1-wide slit .",
    "hear lamp spectra were taken before and after the exposures for the wavelength calibration and the star eg 274 was observed as spectro - photometric standard .",
    "the spectra were reduced following standard procedures .",
    "the emmi instrumental resolution , estimated on sky lines is 36  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the flux calibration was obtained by comparing the wavelength calibrated spectra of the standard star with the flux table published . from the 2d combined frame we extracted 1d spectra with an aperture of 2.6 . a linear fit on the continuum",
    "gives a slight positive slope from @xmath11 at 6600to @xmath12@xmath7 at 7200 . to double",
    "check the flux calibration we used a hst archive image taken in the f814w filter centered at 7940 . for our spectroscopic aperture",
    "we obtained a flux of @xmath13@xmath7 , that agrees with our calibration to better than 5% .",
    "the medium resolution spectrum of the southern nucleus subtracted of the continuum is shown in the top panel of figs.[emmi_free ] and [ emmi_fix ] .",
    "we observed two spectra with the medium resolution grism of sofi at the eso - ntt .",
    "the spectra are respectively centered on the h and the ks bands .",
    "they were acquired in 1999 may with 40 minutes of integration in h and 66 minutes in ks .",
    "the ks spectrum was observed again in 1999 september for 30 minutes of integration .",
    "we always used a 1-wide slit giving a resolution r=900 in h and r=1350 in ks .",
    "a low resolution spectrum ( r=600 ) covering the range from 1.5 to 2.5 @xmath14 has been obtained with sofi in 2001 june , the total integration time was in this case 40 minutes .",
    "the position angle was always 12 .",
    "the data reduction followed the standard steps for nir spectroscopy .",
    "1d spectra were extracted with an aperture of 2.6 for the southern component .",
    "atmospheric features were corrected by dividing for the spectrum of a reference star . in the observation of 1999",
    "may we used a g1v and a f8v star , then the spectra were multiplied by the solar spectrum to remove the stellar features and reestablish the correct slope of the continuum ( maiolino et al .",
    "1996 ) . in 1999",
    "september we used an o6 star and then multiplied by a blackbody at 40000 k to reestablish the correct slope of the continuum .",
    "the ks spectra observed on the two occasions give a good check on the reliability of this method ; they are virtually identical showing no residual features from the reference star and exactly the same slope of the continuum .",
    "the ks spectra have been averaged together giving a final spectrum with 1h36 m of integration .",
    "to flux calibrate the spectra we obtained two images in the h and ks band with sofi in 2001 june ; the integration time was 15 minutes in each band . from the images we extracted the photometry on the spectroscopic aperture obtaining fluxes of @xmath15 and @xmath16erg  s@xmath7  @xmath17m@xmath7 in h and ks respectively .",
    "the photometric error was always below 3% .",
    "this value does not include the uncertainty on the spectroscopic apertures and on their centering , however we believe that this procedure guarantees a very accurate flux calibration . in the case of the low resolution spectrum",
    "the slope of the continuum was readjusted to match the photometric points . in fig.[sofi ] we present the nir spectra of the southern nucleus . the top curve is the low resolution spectrum calibrated in flux . in the middle the medium resolution spectrum . in the bottom part of the left panel",
    "we show a stellar template redshifted to match the galaxy with the indication of the absorption features detectable . in the bottom",
    "right panel the k spectrum , with the @xmath18(1 - 0)s(3 ) line subtracted , clearly shows the detection of [ sivi ] ( see section 3.2 for details ) .",
    "our nir spectra of the northern nucleus are virtually featureless .",
    "the radio observations were performed with the swedish eso - submillimetre telescope ( sest ) in la silla during 1999 november .",
    "the fwhm beam sizes are 45 and 23 at 115ghz and 230ghz respectively , and the main beam efficiencies at these frequencies are 0.70 and 0.50 .",
    "intensity calibration is done with the chopper wheel method , so the raw data , in units of t@xmath19 , are divided by the main beam efficiency to obtain main beam brightness temperatures .",
    "the internal consistency of the sest is accurate to within a few percent .",
    "the backends used were two acousto - optical spectrometers , each with a total bandwidth of 1 ghz .",
    "system temperatures ranged between 200k and 350k on the t@xmath19 scale .",
    "all observations of the co lines were performed with @xmath20 .",
    "the sest s absolute pointing accuracy is 3  rms in azimuth and elevation , and the pointing model was checked with regular observations of sio maser sources . beam switching mode was employed , where the secondary mirror was wobbled with a beam throw of 697  in azimuth and scans obtained with reference positions on either side were coadded to ensure flat baselines .",
    "the data were reduced with the class software of the grenoble astrophysical group ( gag ) package . a polynomial baseline of order one , or occasionally three ,",
    "was removed from each spectrum before averaging .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "the optical spectrum of the southern nucleus shows broad emission lines even at low resolution . at high resolution",
    "it is evident how each emission line contains more than one component .",
    "it is not an easy task to describe the lines in terms of simple components , since most of the lines in the observed spectral range observed are blended .",
    "after several unsatisfactory attempts with the most common data reduction packages we decided to develop our own code to produce the best fit of the observed spectrum taking into account all known constraints , mainly [ oi]6363 = 0.33 [ oi]6300 and [ nii]6583 = 3 [ nii ] 6584 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ h_mod ]",
    "we have observed the ultra luminous infrared galaxy iras  19254 - 7245 , concentrating our investigation on the southern component with observations that range from the optical to the millimetre .",
    "the results of our investigation can be briefly summarized as follow :    1 .   based on our nir and optical data",
    "we estimate a visual extinction between 3 and 4 mag . the continuum can be well reproduced assuming this value .",
    "2 .   the optical emission lines have broad and complex profiles indicative of gas clouds rapidly moving around the nucleus .",
    "the nir lines are similarly broad though with a much simpler profile .",
    "3 .   coronal lines from [ fevii]5721 and [ sivi]1.96 are detected .",
    "their ratio is consistent , within the error , with the value expected from photoionization .",
    "4 .   nir lines from @xmath18 and [ feii ] are bright and give unusually high ratios with @xmath21 even for the agn standards .",
    "the @xmath18 is thermally excited and has a very high luminosity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "5 .   from the co luminosity",
    "we derive a @xmath18 mass of @xmath23 .",
    "we are grateful to pierre - alain duc for making his nir images of iras19254 - 7245 available to us and to chad engelbracht for sending to us his stellar template spectra .",
    "we also thanks leonardo testi for useful discussions and for his careful reading of the first draft of this paper .",
