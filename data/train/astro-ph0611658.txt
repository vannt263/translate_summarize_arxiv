    "of the 151 nearby stars known to harbor one or more planets , 19 are well - characterized multiple - planet systems , and an additional 24 show radial velocity ( rv ) residuals indicative of additional companions @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported additional companions around five stars , including two revealed by incomplete orbits apparent in the rv residuals ( hd 50499 and hd 217107 ) , and one as a short - period , low amplitude variation in the residuals of the fit to a long - period outer companion .",
    "@xcite detected a 7.5 earth - mass mass companion to gj 876 in a 2-day period through analysis of the rv residuals to a 2-planet dynamical fit of the more massive , outer exoplanets .",
    "@xcite similarly analyzed the rv residuals of 4 stars to search for neptune - mass companions .",
    "very little is known about the frequency or nature of exoplanets with orbital distances greater than 5 au @xcite .",
    "precise radial velocities have only reached the precision required to detect such objects within the last 10 years @xcite , which is less than the orbital period of such objects ( @xmath6 y for exoplanets orbiting solar mass stars ) .",
    "thus , the rv curves for such planets are all necessarily incomplete , and we must obtain many more years of data before our knowledge of their orbits improves significantly .    the ability to put constraints on planets with incomplete orbits , however weak , allows us to peek beyond the 5 au completeness limit inherent in the ten - year - old planet searches .",
    "characterizing incomplete orbits also increases our sample of known multiple exoplanetary systems , which improves our understanding of the frequency of orbital resonances , the growth of multiple planets , and the mechanics of orbital migration .    in this work",
    ", we present our analysis of the rv data of @xcite in an effort to determine which of those systems have additional , low - amplitude companions .",
    "many systems known to host one exoplanet show more distant , long - period companions with highly significant but incomplete orbits . in these systems , it can be extremely difficult to constrain the properties of the outer companion : in the case of a simple trend with no curvature , very little can be said about the nature of these companions beyond their existence , but even this informs studies of exoplanet multiplicity and the frequency of exoplanets in binary systems .    in   [ hip14810 ] we discuss a new multiple planet system from the n2k project , hip 14810 . in   [ trends ] we describe how we have employed a false alarm probability statistic to test the significance of trends in the rv data of stars already known to host exoplanets .",
    "we find that six stars known to host exoplanets have previously undetected trends , and thus additional companions .    when the rv residuals to a single keplerian show significant curvature , one may be able to place additional constraints on the maximum @xmath7 of the additional companion . in  ",
    "[ mapsection][twonew ] we present our analysis of this problem in the cases of hd 24040 b and hd 154345 b , two substellar companions new to this work with very incomplete orbits . by mapping @xmath8 space for keplerian fits ,",
    "we show that hd 154345 b is almost certainly planetary ( @xmath9 ) , and that hd 24040 b may be planetary ( @xmath10 ) .    in   [ mining ]",
    "we describe how we extended this method to the rv residuals of known planet - bearing stars which show trends .",
    "we find that for 2 stars we can place sufficiently strong upper limits on @xmath11to suggest that the additional companions are planetary in nature .",

    "* ) present a detailed discussion of using false alarm probabilities ( faps ) for determining the significance of a periodic signal in an rv time series . here",
    ", our task is similar .",
    "we wish to test the hypothesis that a star has an additional companion with a long period , manifest only as a linear trend in the rv series .",
    "we compare this hypothesis to the null hypothesis that the data are adequately described only by the best - fit keplerians and noise .",
    "we first fit the data set with a keplerian model and compare the @xmath18 statistic to that of a model employing a keplerian plus a linear trend .",
    "if this statistic improves , that is , if @xmath19 is negative , then the inclusion of the trend may be justified . to test the significance of the reduction in @xmath18",
    ", we employ an fap test .",
    "we first employ a bootstrap method to determine our measurement uncertainties .",
    "we subtract the best - fit keplerian rv curve from the data and assume the null hypothesis  namely that the residuals to this fit are properly characterized as noise and thus approximate the underlying probability distribution function of the noise in the measurements .",
    "we then draw from this set of residuals ( with replacement ) a mock set of residuals with the same temporal spacing as the original set .    by adding these mock residuals to the best - fit keplerian rv curve we produce a mock data set with the same temporal sampling as the original data set , but with the velocity residuals `` scrambled '' ( `` re - drawn '' might be a better term since we have drawn residuals _ with _ replacement . )",
    "it is important in this procedure that internal errors remain associated with the scrambled residuals .",
    "this ensures that points with error bars so large that they contribute little to the @xmath18 sum , but nonetheless lie far from the best - fit curve , do not gain significance when `` scrambled '' , inappropriately increasing @xmath18 .",
    "we then compare @xmath20 for our mock data set to that of our genuine data . by repeating this procedure 400 times",
    ", we produce 400 mock sets of residuals and 400 values for @xmath20 .",
    "if the linear trend is simply an artifact of the noise , then re - drawing the residuals should not systematically improve or worsen @xmath20 .",
    "conversely , if a linear trend is significant , then the null hypothesis , that the residuals to a keplerian are uncorrelated noise , is invalid , and re - drawing them should worsen the quality of the keplerian(s ) plus trend fit , since scrambling will remove evidence of the trend .",
    "thus , the fraction of these sets with @xmath20 less than that of the proper , unscrambled residuals , provides a measurement of the false alarm probability that the residuals to a keplerian - only fit are correlated .",
    "the catalog of nearby exoplanets @xcite contains 172 substellar companions with @xmath21 orbiting 148 stars within 200 pc .",
    "since then , at least 3 more systems have been announced , including a triple - neptune @xcite , and two single - planet detections @xcite , @xcite . of these 151 systems ,",
    "24 show significant trends in addition to the keplerian curves of the known exoplanets .",
    "we have reanalyzed the radial velocities of @xcite to determine the significance of these trends and to find evidence for additional trends using the fap test described in   [ faptrend ] .",
    "note that we have obtained additional data for some of these systems since @xcite went to press .",
    "we confirm here 21 of the 24 trends in @xcite to have faps below 1% ( 2 others are in systems on which we have no data to test , and the third is hd 11964 , discussed in   [ lowamps ] ) .",
    "we also confirm the trend in the 14 her system , first announced in @xcite and analyzed more thoroughly in @xcite , and   [ incompletes ] .",
    "we confirm the finding of @xcite that the trend reported in @xcite for hd 45350 b is not significant ( fap=0.6 and @xmath18 _ increases _ with the introduction of a trend ) .",
    "we announce here the detection of statistically significant linear trends ( fap @xmath22 ) around 4 stars already known to harbor a single exoplanet : hd 83443 , gj 436 (= hip 57087 ) , hd 102117 , and hd 195019 .",
