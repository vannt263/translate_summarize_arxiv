    "cryogenic buffer - gas cooling has proven to be a very general and powerful method to produce internally and translationally cold molecules  @xcite .",
    "+ here we demonstrate the full characterization of the properties of buffer - gas - cooled molecular beams , and , on this basis , elucidate various aspects of buffer - gas cooling .",
    "our characterization relies on the combination of four components .",
    "first , we extract cold molecules from a buffer - gas cell by electrostatic guiding in a quadrupole guide  @xcite .",

    "we demonstrate addressing of all significantly populated internal states of the guided molecules emerging from our cryogenic buffer - gas source , operated in different regimes , boosted  @xcite or supersonic  @xcite .",
    "we applied this method to different species of polyatomic symmetric - top polar molecules , fluoromethane , @xmath1 , and 3,3,3-trifluoropropyne , @xmath2 , and made comparison of their cooling processes .",
    "we provide clear evidence of the efficient control over the internal cooling of the guided molecular beams through varying the buffer - gas - cell temperature and the buffer - gas density , demonstrating the possibility of cooling far below the cell temperature in the supersonic regime",
    ". the detailed study of the buffer - gas cooling reveals two interesting phenomena .",
    "first , comparing the rotational with the translational temperature , we provide evidence that rotational cooling takes place more efficiently than translational cooling for the ch@xmath0f - he system in the low he density regime .",
    "second , the measurements provide indications of dependence of the collisional relaxation rate on the rotational states of the molecules . + our paper is structured as follows . in section  [ section_method ]",
    "we present a brief review of symmetric - top molecules , and then describe the principle of our method for rotational - state detection of guided molecules .",

    "the monte carlo trajectory simulations used to calculate the guiding efficiencies for all relevant rotational states are described in section  [ section_montecarlo ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ section_discussion ] we present the results from the comprehensive characterization of our buffer - gas source .",
    "there we analyze the cell s output for different operating regimes and for different molecular species , and draw inferences on the cooling mechanisms in the buffer - gas cell .",
    "one of the key features in this work is the implementation of a new method for state detection , which is a pivotal tool for the characterization of cold molecular beams from cryogenic buffer - gas sources .",
    "several techniques for state detection of cold molecules have been used so far  @xcite . among them , depletion methods , as adopted in previous experiments carried out by our group  @xcite , are particularly advantageous since they are applicable to a large range of molecules and avoid the difficulties of the light - induced fluorescence ( lif ) and resonance - enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) detection techniques . along this line , we have extended the depletion technique by implementing rotational - state detection adapted to the cold guided molecular beams from a cryogenic buffer - gas source , using resonance rf depletion spectroscopy in a parallel - plate capacitor .",
    "+      to understand our method for rotational - state detection , first we briefly review the relevant properties of symmetric - top molecules , which have been used in the current study .",
    "their rotational states can be fully described by three quantum numbers  @xcite , the total angular momentum , @xmath3 , its projection on the molecule s symmetry axis , @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 ) , and its projection on a laboratory - fixed axis , @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "hereinafter the rotational states will be designated as @xmath8 or @xmath9 , depending on the need to specify the quantum number @xmath6 .",
    "+ in the absence of external electric fields , the energy of a symmetric - top molecule in the rigid - rotor approximation is expressed as @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 is planck s constant , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the rotational constants of a symmetric - top molecule .",
    "the presence of an external electric field splits every @xmath9 state ( stark effect ) into @xmath14 @xmath6-sublevels , corresponding to all possible projections of @xmath15 on the electric - field axis .",
    "the first - order stark splitting is given by the expression @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule and the electric - field strength , respectively .",
    "sublevels with a positive stark shift are referred to as low - field - seeking states ( states that are guided ) . since states @xmath19 are degenerate with states @xmath20 under inversion symmetry , we ignore hereinafter the sign of @xmath4 and adopt the convention that states with positive @xmath6 are low - field - seeking .",
    "an example of the stark effect is presented in figure  [ fig_expsetup](a ) for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states of @xmath1 . for @xmath9 states with @xmath23 , the first - order stark",
    "splitting is zero . in this case ,",
    "low - field - seeking states due to the second - order ( quadratic ) stark shift exist , if they satisfy the condition @xmath24 , which derives from the expression for the quadratic stark shift @xmath25 $ ] for @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the expression of @xmath26 for the case @xmath27 is identical to the above one , except the quantum number @xmath6 in the expression is replaced by @xmath4 .",
    "thus states with @xmath27 can also be low - field - seeking states . +      our method for rotational - state detection is based on state - selective addressing and elimination of molecules from a guided population by applying an rf field resonant to the dc stark splitting in a homogeneous field .",
    "this leads to a depletion of the measured signal and reveals the relative state population .",
    "+ molecules emerging from the cryogenic source populate different rotational states @xmath9 .",
    "only molecules in low - field - seeking @xmath6-sublevels , however , are confined in the guide .",
    "subsequently , the guide is interrupted by a parallel - plate capacitor creating a homogeneous offset electric field . at low field , this causes equidistant stark splitting of the @xmath6-sublevels for a given @xmath28 state .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is unique for most of the low - lying @xmath9 states for a given offset field ( see figure  [ fig_expsetup](a ) ) .",
    "this allows for @xmath9 states to be addressed individually .",
    "an rf field which is resonant to the stark splitting between the @xmath6-sublevels of the rotational state @xmath9 we want to address is applied to the capacitor , and transfers the molecules into different @xmath6-sublevels .",
    "those molecules which land in non - guidable states are eliminated from the guiding after the capacitor , and this leads to a depletion signal on the detector . + to achieve a good control over the resulting @xmath6-substate distribution , we broaden the rf signal with white noise and hence eliminate coherent effects in the population transfer process .",
    "the molecules are thereby equally redistributed among all the @xmath6-sublevels within the given @xmath9 rotational state ( figure  [ fig_expsetup](a ) ) , when the transitions are power - saturated . to a first approximation ,",
    "the depletion ratio in this case is given by the fraction of molecules converted from guidable to non - guidable states , and this is the ratio between the number of non - guidable @xmath6-sublevels and the total number of @xmath6-sublevels , i.e. , @xmath29 for a linear stark shift . the fraction of guided molecules populating the probed rotational state is therefore obtained by dividing the magnitude of the saturated depletion by this ratio .",
    "in addition , a decrease in signal results also from transferring molecules from a guidable state with a large stark shift to one with a small stark shift , as the latter are more prone to losses in the guide .",
    "thus the simplified depletion ratio needs to be corrected including the subtle effects of guiding efficiency of molecules in different @xmath6-sublevels , which are described in detail in section  [ section_montecarlo ] .",
    "the scheme of the experimental set - up is shown in figure  [ fig_expsetup](b ) . in our experiment",
    ", buffer - gas cooling takes place in a cryogenic cell where a continuous flow of polyatomic polar molecules is mixed with a continuous flow of helium or neon at cryogenic temperatures of @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the exact cell temperature can be monitored by diode sensors and controlled by an electric heating block .",
    "the gas inflow is monitored by pressure gauges and regulated by needle valves along the corresponding gas lines .",
    "after the cold molecules leave the cell , they are captured by a quadrupole guide , which delivers them to a detector or to further experiments .",
    "the experimental set - up is an upgraded version of the set - up described previously  @xcite to enable rf depletion spectroscopy on the guided molecules .    ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 : red lines show guidable sublevels , and blue lines show non - guidable ones .",
    "the @xmath32 state is weakly guidable due to its second - order stark shift .",
    "the vertical dashed line designates the applied homogeneous electric field ( @xmath33 ) used in the radio - frequency scans shown in figure  [ fig_rfspectroscopy](a ) .",
    "the arrows show the magnitude of the stark splitting corresponding to the applied electric field .",
    "this splitting is unique for most low - lying @xmath9 states .",
    "( b ) scheme of the experimental set - up . ]    our buffer - gas set - up can be operated in two different regimes , boosted and supersonic .",
    "the supersonic regime is achieved for buffer - gas densities typically one to two orders of magnitude higher compared to those used in the boosted regime , and is characterized by a large number of collisions at the cell output orifice and within a short distance downstream from it .",
    "the high buffer - gas densities result in a high pressure gradient across the nozzle , and consequently , in an adiabatic expansion , leading to further cooling of the gas emerging from the cell  @xcite .",
    "the boosted regime is an intermediate between the supersonic and the effusive ( i.e. , collisionless ) regime , where a few collisions occur near the nozzle , and thereby the slowest molecules are eliminated from the beam .",
    "the two regimes require different geometries . for the boosted regime ,",
    "the guide is distanced about @xmath34 from the cell nozzle . in the case of the supersonic regime ,",
    "that spacing is _ ca .",
    "_ @xmath35 to allow enough distance for the supersonic beam formation .",
    "the cell exit aperture used in our experiments has a diameter of @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum electric field that can be achieved between the guiding electrodes is about @xmath36 .",
    "we use a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) to detect the molecules after they leave the guide .",
    "+ the capacitor for driving rf transitions is built of two parallel ( @xmath37 ) plates with a @xmath38 spacing between them .",
    "a bias voltage from a few tens of volts up to a few thousand volts is applied to the capacitor , providing a homogeneous electrostatic field between the plates .",
    "the capacitor is separated from the two guide segments by gaps of @xmath39 .",
    "the plates are made from circuit boards .",
    "one of the plates is a plain board , whereas the other one features a t - shaped microstrip used to apply the rf field . as the flat end of the t - shaped microstrip",
    "is aligned with the molecules flow axis , the rf field is expected to be predominantly perpendicular to the homogeneous field in the molecules transit region .",
    "this configuration enables driving of @xmath40 transitions .",

    "+ figure  [ fig_rfspectroscopy](a ) shows a clear change in the dip pattern and in the relative dip depth as the buffer - gas density is changed .",
    "increasing the buffer gas density in the cell increases the number of collisions and therefore leads to a lower rotational temperature .",
    "this effect is clearly visible , as the depletion signal corresponding to the low - lying rotational states @xmath21 and @xmath22 increases , while the signal from the other states of higher rotational energy decreases , and eventually vanishes . +     for different he densities in the buffer - gas cell ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "the magnitude of the depletion signal depends not only on the thermal population of the probed state , but also on the applied rf power . to eliminate this effect , we performed rf power scans for each @xmath9 rotational state to obtain its saturated depletion level .",
    "coherent effects , which lead to rabi oscillations between the @xmath6-sublevels and therefore hinder an equal redistribution of population among all @xmath6-sublevels , were eliminated by broadening the rf signal to @xmath47 with white noise ( the white noise is not applied in the frequency scan in figure  [ fig_rfspectroscopy](a ) ) .",

    "one subtlety here is that the simulations for the @xmath90 distribution and for the rotational - state distribution need each other s results as their inputs .",
    "this interdependence can be resolved by realizing that the @xmath90-dependent guiding efficiency is only weakly influenced by the state composition , and the two simulations can be performed iteratively . in practice , we start with a state distribution corresponding to the boltzmann distribution at @xmath91 in order to determine the initial @xmath90-distribution at the guide input .",

    "this last assumption of reaching a boltzmann distribution in the cell at a fitted temperature is validated by the results shown in section  [ subsection_trottcell ] .",

    "is explained in section  [ section_montecarlo ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](a ) shows the @xmath90-distributions of @xmath1 for the same cell parameters as those used in the @xmath87 measurement in section  [ subsection_trotbgdensity ] .",

    "gaussian fits centred at peak velocities have been applied to all but the lowest - density distribution ( @xmath120 ) .",

    "the use of a different fit function is substantiated by the quantitative model below . +",
    "to further analyze the changes in the @xmath90-distribution , we plot in figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](b ) the mean longitudinal velocity , @xmath118 , as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "the value of @xmath118 is extracted from the fits in figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](a ) .",
    "its increase at higher @xmath119 is understood to result from collisions between molecules and he atoms in the vicinity of the nozzle  @xcite .",
    "the lighter he atoms move at a higher speed and kick the heavier molecules from behind whereby the molecules get accelerated in the forward direction . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we have built the following model based on the momentum transfer for elastic collisions . from conservation of energy and momentum ,",
    "the change in the molecules velocity per head - on collision is @xmath121 , where @xmath122 with @xmath123 being the mass of the molecule ( he atom ) , and @xmath124 is the longitudinal velocity of the he atom .",
    "as the he density in the nozzle region is typically much higher than the molecule density , we assume @xmath124 to be constant and approaching the supersonic velocity , which sets the upper bound for the mean velocity of he in the limit of high density  @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the number of head - on collisions in the molecular - beam direction , @xmath127 is the centre velocity of a he supersonic beam at @xmath91 , and @xmath128 is the initial longitudinal velocity of the molecules .",
    "@xmath126 is related to @xmath119 by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 mm is the nozzle diameter setting a rough estimate of the distance where collisions take place , @xmath131 is the @xmath1-he elastic collision cross - section , and @xmath132 is a proportionality factor on the order of unity taking into account the fact that only collisions in the direction normal to the nozzle plane contribute to the change in @xmath90 . assuming the molecules have translationally thermalized to @xmath91 before arriving at the nozzle , and hence @xmath128 is approximately their thermal mean velocity at @xmath91 , our model ( the solid curve in figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](b ) ) describes very well the dependence of @xmath118 with respect to @xmath119 with the exception of the lowest - density point .",
    "the only fit parameter in the model is @xmath133 , which agrees within one order - of - magnitude with the typical @xmath1-he collision cross - section at this temperature range  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that the lowest - density data stays above the model curve shows that the translational degree of freedom of molecules is not yet thermalized to @xmath91 at this point , in line with the finding in the @xmath87 measurement at low he densities ( see section  [ subsection_trotbgdensity ] ) .",
    "this also justifies using a different fit function for the lowest - density @xmath90-distribution ( figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](a ) ) . + in the following",
    "we discuss the translational temperature of molecules , @xmath134 , and compare it to the rotational one .",
    "while the width of a gaussian fit to the @xmath90-distribution defines @xmath134 in the high - density limit , where molecular beams approach the supersonic regime , it provides only a lower bound to @xmath134 in the low - density limit where a maxwellian distribution describes @xmath90 better , as shown in figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](a ) .",
    "thus we assign a lower bound to @xmath134 of @xmath135 for the distribution at @xmath120 based on its width , while its mean kinetic energy corresponds to @xmath136 . in comparison , @xmath87 at this density is found to be @xmath137 ( the second point in figure  [ fig_hedensity ] ) , which is clearly lower than the value of @xmath134 . having a colder @xmath87 than @xmath134 might not be surprising for the given system because of the large mass imbalance between @xmath1 and he , which makes cooling of the centre of mass motion inefficient . on the other hand , the @xmath90-distribution for the highest density in figure  [ fig_longvelodistrib](a ) ( @xmath138 ) has a width corresponding to @xmath139 , which is very similar to @xmath140 found in section  [ subsection_trotbgdensity ]",
    ". presumably , in the high - density limit , @xmath134 and @xmath87 should converge due to the sufficient number of collisions .",
    "+       and different he densities , ( a ) @xmath141 , ( b ) @xmath142 , and ( c ) @xmath143 , at a fixed cell temperature @xmath50 , and simulated depletion signals for different rotational states and different rotational temperatures ( lines ) for each of the applied he densities . ]    in section  [ subsection_trotbgdensity ] we have investigated the dependence of fitted @xmath87 on the he density in the cell . in this section we take a closer look at the state distribution in the low he density limit .",
    "figure  [ fig_jkthermalization ] shows a comparison between the measured depletion signals and the corresponding theory curves in increasing order of he density , @xmath141 , @xmath144 , and @xmath111 and at @xmath50 , corresponding to the first three points of the @xmath1 data in figure  [ fig_hedensity](a ) .",
    "similarly to figure  [ fig_trotfit](a ) , the data are grouped in columns , and the only fit parameter is the horizontal position of the column , which determines @xmath87 . the results clearly demonstrate that with increasing he density , the rotational states are better thermalized , and the fitted @xmath87 approaches @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , at lower he density , the larger deviation between the measured depletion signals and the theoretical curves also indicates that the internal states are not fully thermalized . in particular , we would like to point out that the depletion signals for the @xmath145 state ( orange diamonds in figure  [ fig_jkthermalization ] ) appear far above their theoretical curves , and would correspond to a much higher rotational temperature if the @xmath145 state were fitted alone .",
    "this is an indication that the @xmath145 state thermalizes more slowly than the other states .",
    "based on nuclear spin statistics , states with @xmath4 being a multiple of 3 ( ortho-@xmath1 ) are not interconvertible with states of @xmath4 not being a multiple of 3 ( para-@xmath1 )  @xcite via buffer - gas collisions .",
    "hence , @xmath1 from the @xmath145 state can only relax to states with @xmath23 . since the rotational energy scales as @xmath146 , a transition of the type @xmath147 requires 3 times more energy to be taken away than a transition of the type @xmath148 does .",
    "thus we attribute the above - observed effect to the larger energy difference between the initial and the final state , which makes the @xmath145 state thermalize at a lower rate than the other probed states .",
    "we have developed a versatile and robust method for rotational and translational thermometry of cold molecules emerging from a cryogenic buffer - gas source .",
    "the method consists of three independent tools , time - of - flight measurements yielding the longitudinal velocity distribution , resonant radio - frequency rotational - state - selective detection of guided molecules , capable of addressing @xmath149 of their population , and a complete monte - carlo simulation package resolving the guiding efficiencies for all present states .",
    "+ the obtained results make possible the full characterization of buffer - gas sources and provide insight into the cooling processes in a cryogenic cell operated in different regimes . studying those mechanisms",
    ", we have established an efficient control over the rotational and translational cooling of guided molecular beams by tuning the buffer - gas - cell temperature and the buffer - gas density .",
    "we have demonstrated rotational cooling below the cell temperature for the strongly boosted and supersonic regimes , achieving rotational temperatures more than an order of magnitude lower than the cell temperature .",
    "interesting physical phenomena have also been observed . comparing the rotational with the translational temperature ,",
    "we have shown evidence of faster thermalization of the rotational degrees of freedom for the @xmath1-he collisions at the limit of low @xmath119 . we have also observed manifestations of rotational - state - dependent cooling rates , and we have provided an explanation of this effect . + the presented thermometry method is a very general one , which can be applied to a vast variety of molecules .",
    "it is particularly useful for probing cold molecules that are not amenable to other techniques , e.g. , lif or rempi .",
    "moreover , the thorough understanding of the cooling mechanisms in a cryogenic buffer - gas cell , provided by the new method , is the key to optimizing the production of internally and translationally cold molecules .",
