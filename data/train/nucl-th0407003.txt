    "in recent years , the study of the properties of nuclear systems starting from a free nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) potential @xmath5 has become a subject of special interest .",
    "this has been stimulated by the substantial progress made during the last decade in the development of @xmath3 potentials that reproduce with high precision the @xmath3 scattering data and deuteron properties @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that these potentials predict almost identical phase shifts does not imply , owing to their different off - shell behavior , that they should give the same results when employed in nuclear many - body calculations .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to investigate how much nuclear structure results depend on the @xmath3 potential one starts with , namely to try to assess the relevance of the off - shell effects in microscopic nuclear structure calculations .",
    "the differences between various @xmath3 potentials in describing properties of nuclear matter have been investigated by several authors , the main aim being to try to assess the role of the various components of the nuclear force . in this context",
    ", we may mention the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite , where attention has been focused on modern phase - shift equivalent @xmath3 potentials .",
    "as regards the study of finite nuclei , while a rather large number of realistic nuclear structure calculations have been carried out in the past few years , only a few attempts have been made @xcite to study to which extent these calculations depend on the @xmath3 potential used as input .",
    "actually , no detailed comparison of the results produced by different phase - shift equivalent potentials in the description of nuclear structure properties has yet been done .",
    "it may be worth mentioning , however , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where different high - precision @xmath3 potentials have been considered to investigate the effects of nonlocalities on the triton binding energy .    on the above grounds ,",
    "we have found it interesting and timely to perform nuclear structure calculations using different phase - shift equivalent @xmath3 potentials and make a detailed comparison between the corresponding results . in a recent paper @xcite , we performed realistic calculations of the ground - state properties of some doubly magic nuclei within the framework of the goldstone expansion approach , and showed that the rate of convergence is very satisfactory",
    ". motivated by the results obtained in that work , in the present paper we make use of the goldstone expansion to calculate the binding energies and rms charge radii of @xmath0he , @xmath1o , and @xmath2ca for different phase - shift equivalent @xmath3 potentials .",
    "we feel that this is a good `` laboratory '' for a comparative study of the effects of @xmath3 potentials in finite nuclei .",
    "we consider the four high - quality @xmath3 potentials nijmegen ii @xcite , argonne v18 @xcite , cd - bonn @xcite , and n@xmath6lo @xcite .",
    "as is well known , to perform nuclear structure calculations with realistic @xmath3 potentials one has to deal with the strong repulsive behavior of such potentials in the high - momentum regime .",
    "recently , a new method to renormalize the bare @xmath3 interaction has been proposed @xcite , which is proving to be an advantageous alternative to the use of the brueckner @xmath7 matrix @xcite .",
    "it consists in deriving from @xmath5 a low - momentum potential @xmath4 defined within a cutoff momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this is a smooth potential which preserves exactly the on - shell properties of the original @xmath5 and is suitable for being used directly in nuclear structure calculations .",
    "as in our earlier work @xcite , we construct the @xmath9 for each of the four above mentioned @xmath3 potentials .",
    "the various @xmath4 s are then used directly in hartree - fock calculations .",
    "once the self - consistent basis is obtained , we calculate the goldstone expansion including diagrams up to third order in @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that one of the main advantages of the @xmath9 renormalization method , with respect to the @xmath7-matrix one , is to preserve the phase - shift equivalence of the original @xmath3 potentials .",
    "thus , it is particularly interesting to compare the results obtained in nuclear structure calculations employing on - shell equivalent @xmath4 s .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief description of the main features of the four phase - shift equivalent @xmath3 potentials considered in our study . in sec .",
    "iii we give an outline of the derivation of @xmath4 and some details of our calculations . in sec .",
    "iv we present and discuss our results .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "as reported in the introduction , we employ the nijmegen ii @xcite , argonne v18 @xcite , cd - bonn @xcite , and chiral n@xmath6lo @xcite @xmath3 potentials , which have all been fitted to the nijmegen phase - shift analysis as well as the proton - proton and neutron - proton data below 350 mev @xcite .",
    "it is well known that these potentials , even if they reproduce the @xmath3 data with almost the same accuracy , may have a rather different mathematical structure .",
    "the nijmegen ii and the argonne v18 potentials are non - relativistic and defined in terms of local functions , which are multiplied by a set of spin , isospin and angular momentum operators .",
    "the cd - bonn potential , based on relativistic meson field theory , is represented in terms of the covariant feynmann amplitudes for one - boson exchange , which are nonlocal @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath6lo potential is based upon a chiral effective lagrangian .",
    "the model includes one- and two - pion exchange contributions and so - called contact terms up to chiral order four , some of which are non - local .",
    "all the above @xmath3 interactions reproduce equally well the same phase - shifts , so the corresponding on - shell matrix elements of the reaction matrix @xmath10 are the same as well .",
    "however , this does not imply that the interactions are identical .",
    "the @xmath10-matrix is obtained from the lippmann - schwinger equation    @xmath11 @xmath12    where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 stand for the relative momenta .",
    "notice that the @xmath10-matrix is the sum of two terms , the born term and an integral term . notwithstanding",
    "the sum is the same , the individual terms may still be quite different .",
    "for example , in fig .  1 we show the value of the @xmath15 @xmath10-matrix elements for @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 .",
    "they are indicated by the full circle and are practically identical for the four @xmath3 potentials we have employed . in fig .",
    "1 we display also the matrix elements @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 for the four potentials .",
    "the asterisks stand for the diagonal matrix elements @xmath20 , which represent the born approximation to @xmath10 . from the inspection of this figure ,",
    "it is clear that even if different @xmath5 s reproduce the same @xmath10-matrix element , the latter is obtained by summing two terms that are significantly different for each potential .",
    "more precisely , it is evident that nijmegen ii potential is a quite `` hard '' potential , its diagonal matrix element being very repulsive .",
    "so , in order to reproduce correctly the on - shell @xmath10-matrix element , it needs a large attractive contribution from the integral term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the latter being related to the tensor component of the @xmath3 force and to its off - shell behavior ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a closer examination ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the n@xmath6lo interaction is a rather `` soft '' potential , implying a smaller contribution from the integral term .     for the @xmath21 partial wave for cd - bonn ( green line ) , nijmegen ii ( red line ) , argonne v18 ( black line ) , and n@xmath6lo ( blue line ) potentials .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements @xmath22 are marked by an asterisk .",
    "the corresponding @xmath10-matrix element is marked by a full circle ( see text for more details ) . ]",
    "similar features may be observed also in the other partial waves , however , the differences among the potentials decrease for larger values of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "a traditional approach to the renormalization of the strong repulsive behavior of realistic @xmath3 potentials , when dealing with doubly closed - shell nuclei , is the brueckner - goldstone ( bg ) theory ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the goldstone perturbative expansion is re - ordered summing to all orders only the ladder diagrams .",
    "consequently , the bare interaction ( @xmath5 ) vertices are replaced by the reaction matrix ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this framework leads to the well known brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) theory , when the self - consistent definition is adopted for the single - particle ( sp ) auxiliary potential and only the first - order contribution in the bg expansion is taken into account .",
    "so , the bhf approximation gives a mean field description of the ground state of nuclei in terms of the @xmath7 matrix , the latter taking into account the correlations between pairs of nucleons .",
    "however this procedure is not without difficulties , because of the energy dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we renormalize the short - range repulsion of the bare @xmath3 potential by integrating out its high momentum components @xcite .",
    "the resulting low - momentum potential , @xmath4 , is a smooth potential , whose vertices can be used directly to sum up the goldstone expansion diagrams .    according to the general definition of a renormalization group transformation , @xmath4 must be such that the low - energy observables calculated in the full theory are preserved exactly by the effective theory .    for the nucleon - nucleon problem in vacuum , we require that the deuteron binding energy , low - energy phase shifts , and low - momentum half - on - shell @xmath10 matrix calculated from @xmath5 must be reproduced by @xmath4",
    ". the effective low - momentum t matrix is defined by    @xmath23 @xmath24    note that for @xmath25 the intermediate states are integrated up to @xmath8 .",
    "it is required that , for @xmath26 and @xmath27 both belonging to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the above requirements are satisfied when @xmath4 is given by the folded - diagram series    @xmath31 @xmath32    where @xmath33 is an irreducible vertex function , in the sense that its intermediate states must be outside the model space @xmath28 .",
    "the integral sign represents a generalized folding operation @xcite , and @xmath34 is obtained from @xmath33 by removing terms of first order in the interaction .",
    "the above @xmath4 can be calculated by means of iterative techniques .",
    "we have used here an iteration method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is particularly suitable for non - degenerate model spaces .",
    "this method , which we refer to as andreozzi - lee - suzuki ( als ) method , is an iterative method of the lee - suzuki type @xcite .    to exemplify how @xmath4 preserves low - energy observables",
    ", we report in table i the deuteron binding energy , and the neutron - proton @xmath35 phase shifts calculated both with the full cd - bonn potential and its @xmath4 ( with a cut - off momentum @xmath36 ) .",
    ".deuteron binding energy ( mev ) and @xmath37 @xmath35 phase shifts ( deg ) as predicted by full cd - bonn and its @xmath4 ( @xmath36 ) [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the aim of this work has been to compare the results of microscopic nuclear structure calculations , starting from four different phase - shift equivalent @xmath3 potentials , nijmegen ii , argonne v18 , cd - bonn , and n@xmath6lo . to this end , we have calculated ground - state properties of the doubly closed nuclei @xmath0he , @xmath1o , and @xmath2ca by way of the goldstone expansion .",
    "this has been done within the framework of the so - called @xmath4 approach @xcite to the renormalization of the short - range repulsion of the @xmath3 potentials , wherein a low - momentum potential is derived , which preserves the low - energy physics of the original potential .",
    "the analysis of the results obtained shows that the calculated properties are only weakly dependent on the @xmath3 potential used as input .",
    "this result may be traced back to the renormalization procedure of the short - range repulsion . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have shown that the renormalized potentials are characterized by a reduced off - shell tensor force strength , as compared with that of the original potential .",
    "moreover , the @xmath38 s of the different potentials become quite similar , this quantity being related to the balance between the central and tensor components of the nuclear force .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that when dealing with the n@xmath6lo chiral potential , the renormalization procedure , which by construction preserves exactly the on - shell properties up to the cutoff momentum , scarcely modifies the off - shell behavior .",
    "this feature , which is related to the fact that chiral perturbation theory is a low - momentum expansion , may make this kind of @xmath3 potentials particularly tailored for microscopic nuclear structure calculations .",
