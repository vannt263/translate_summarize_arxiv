    "the effect of geometry on the nature of a phase transition is of particular interest @xcite .",
    "for example , hyperbolic spaces possessing a constant negative curvature of @xmath3 have been recently applied to several condensed matter models , namely the ising model @xcite and percolation @xcite .",
    "why consider hyperbolic spaces ?",
    "hyperbolic geometry connects to properties of mean field theory as studied on bethe lattices with the same nonvanishing ratio of surface to volume of compact structures as the size of the lattice scales to infinity @xcite . and yet there are loops at all length scales as is the case with euclidean lattices . accordingly , hyperbolic lattices provide a test bed for studying phase transitions in a geometry that interpolates between bethe lattices and euclidean lattices .",
    "hyperbolic lattices are also interesting from a glassy physics perspective because they provide a natural mechanism in two dimensions to frustrate global crystalline order and allow for a more tractable model to study the glass transition and jamming in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "a hyperbolic lattice is a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane , usually denoted by the so called schlfli symbol @xmath4 , where regular polygons of @xmath5 sides tile the plane so that @xmath6 of these polygons meet at each vertex  @xcite , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 satisfy the relation @xmath7 it should be noted that ( 1 ) euclidean lattices satisfy the equation @xmath8 and ( 2 ) for lattices on the elliptic plane , the relation @xmath9 holds  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the elliptic and euclidean planes admit just a finite number of tessellations , while the hyperbolic plane is much more richer admiting an infinite number .",
    "we will use the poincare disk respresentation of the hyperbolic plane , which is the unit radius disk with its respective metric  @xcite .",
    "we will work with several hyperbolic tessellations , an example of which is seen in figure  [ tes3_7 ] , to study @xmath0-core  @xcite and force - balance  @xcite percolation models and explore the nature of their transition .",
    "@xmath0-core percolation is constraint percolation model where occupied sites having less than @xmath0 occupied neighboring sites are pruned starting with an initial random and independent occupation of sites .",
    "this pruning is done consecutively until all occupied sites have at least @xmath0 occupied neighboring sites .",
    "this constraint imposes the scalar aspect of the local hilbert stability criterion for purely repulsive particles in @xmath10 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "for example , in two - dimensions , a particle must be surrounded at least three particles ( the scalar aspect ) .",
    "in addition , at least three of these neighboring particles must enclose a particle within a triangle so that forces balance and each particle is locally mechanically stable . in mean field",
    ", @xmath0-core percolation resembles some properties of a mixed phase transition  @xcite , i.e. discontinuity in the order parameter and a diverging length scale , as in the jamming transition  @xcite . and",
    "yet , @xmath0-core percolation on euclidean lattices appears exhibit either a continuous phase transition in the same universality class as ordinary percolation  @xcite , or no transition  @xcite .",
    "so we ask the question : what is the nature of the @xmath0-core percolation transition on hyperbolic lattices",
    "? will the transition behave more like what is computed on the bethe lattice , or not ?",
    "tessellation on the poincare disk.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    as you will soon discover , many of the numerical techniques developed for the analysis of the phase transition in ordinary percolation are not as readily applicable on hyperbolic lattices given the strong boundary effects , which makes the above questions slightly difficult to answer .",
    "there is also the possible complication that there are two phase transitions , as has been demonstrated for ordinary percolation ",
    "one transition at the onset of many spanning clusters touching the boundary and a second transition at the onset of all of the spanning merging into just one spanning cluster  @xcite .",
    "@xcite asked the above questions for the @xmath2 case and concluded , based on a conjecture and on numerical evidence , that the mixed nature of the @xmath2-core percolation transition on the bethe lattice was robust on the hyperbolic lattice . in light of more recent work identifying crossing probabilities on the hyperbolic lattice for ordinary percolation  @xcite",
    ", we revisit the above questions for @xmath2-core percolation and analyze the other @xmath0-core models as well .    given the numerical intricacies , as a means of comparison , we also investigate force - balance percolation on hyperbolic lattices .",
    "force - balance percolation is another constraint percolation model  @xcite in which each site is first occupied with some occupation probability @xmath11 .",
    "then , if an occupied site is not surrounded by neighboring occupied sites such that the local hilbert stability criterion can not be guaranteed , the occupied site is removed from the lattice .",
    "again , the local hilbert stability criterion ensures for a purely repulsive system that forces can be balanced and that each particle be locally mechanically stable .",
    "this procedure is repeated until all occupied sites obey the occupation constraint .",
    "this model was studied in two- and three - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggested strongly signs of a discontinuous transition in the standard order parameter ( i.e. the fraction of sites participating in the spanning cluster ) , which also occurs in jamming .",
    "numerical simulations also suggested that there exists a correlation length scale diverging faster than any power - law , which is different from jamming where numerics suggests a more standard power - law diverging correlation length  @xcite .",
    "so we expect force - balance percolation to exhibit a mixed transition on various euclidean lattices .",
    "a mean field theory of force - balance percolation is not possible because spatial information is encoded in the constraints .",
    "studying force - balance percolation on hyperbolic lattices will allow us to work towards a mean field theory without giving up the spatial constraints .",
    "we expect force - balance percolation to exhibit a discontinuous percolation transition on hyperbolic lattices since it already appears to be in the presence of many loops  @xcite .",
    "perhaps , however , the diverging length scale on the hyperbolic lattice will be a power - law , as opposed to faster than a power - law on the euclidean lattice . in any event",
    ", the discontinuity in the onset of the spanning cluster should give us something to compare against when trying to determine whether or not @xmath0-core percolation exhibits a discontinuous transition on hyperbolic lattices .",
    "the remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows : we will study several properties of @xmath0-core percolation models for @xmath1 , and force - balance percolation on hyperbolic tessellations .",
    "we present in section 2 details of the hyperbolic lattice and various percolation algorithms . in section 3",
    ", we present a theoretical proof that the threshold for force - balance percolation is strictly less than one for most of the tessellations .",
    "this section is a bit technical and can be skipped by the reader should their interest be more in the nature of the phase transition .",
    "we present our numerical results in section 4 , where we study the crossing probability and other measurements .",
    "we summarize and discuss the implications of our results in section 5 .",
    "the key step in the simulation process is to construct a hyperbolic lattice .",
    "we do this by implementing the algorithm described in detail in ref .  @xcite . in the construction of a @xmath4 hyperbolic lattice ,",
    "where again , @xmath5 denotes the number of sides of each polygon and @xmath6 denotes how many polygons meet at a vertex , the central polygon is built first , and this is the first layer .",
    "then , by translations and rotations of the central polygon , the second layer is built .",
    "this process is followed recursively until a desired number of layers is constructed .",
    "an @xmath12-layer is composed of those polygons that do not belong to an @xmath13-layer for @xmath14 and share an edge or vertex with a polygon in the @xmath15-layer .",
    "the algorithm makes use of the _ wierstrass model _ for hyperbolic geometry , where points lie on the upper sheet of the hyperboloid , @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , rotations and translations are given by @xmath17 lorentz matrices .",
    "the wierstrass model is related to the poincare model through the stereographic projection toward the point @xmath18 given by @xmath19    the exponential growth of number of vertices with respect to the number of layers constrains severely the number of layers used in the simulations .",
    "typically we simulate around 10 layers .",
    "this is comparable to the recent work by gu and ziff studying ordinary percolation on hyperbolic lattices  @xcite .",
    "recent work on implementing periodic boundary conditions in certain tilings may ultimately be investigated  @xcite . however , the sets of hyperbolic tillings that can be used using the methods in ref .",
    "@xcite have less than 30000 sites due to a lack of knowledge of all possible normal subgroups of a given fuchsian group .",
    "once a tessellation is created , each of its sites are occupied with probability @xmath11 . for @xmath0-core percolation ,",
    "we then recursively remove any occupied site ( excluding boundary sites ) that has less than @xmath0 occupied neighboring sites . for force - balance percolation",
    ", we recursively remove any occupied sites ( excluding boundary sites ) that are not enclosed by a triangle of neighboring occupied sites , i.e. those sites that are not locally mechanically stable .",
    "we do this until all occupied sites obey the imposed constraint .",
    "we have numerically tested on around one million runs , that the order in which we check the force - balance constraint does not affect the final configuration , i.e. that the model is abelian .",
    "it has been also argued that the @xmath0-core model is abelian  @xcite .",
    "we then use the hoshen - kopelman algorithm to identify the clusters and their respective sizes . to determine if a cluster is spanning , we break up the lattice into four cardinal regions : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    ". see figure  [ tes3_7_quarters ] .",
    "we regard the cluster as percolating , or spanning , when it connects either @xmath20 and @xmath22 sites or @xmath21 and @xmath23 sites , as in ref .",
    "we then measure the probability to span , or cross for an occupation probability @xmath11 and denote it @xmath24 .",
    "we also measure a quantity defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the size of the largest cluster and @xmath27 the total number of sites .",
    "this quantity resembles the order parameter and , therefore , determines the continuity / discontinuity of the onset of the transition(s ) , i.e. should it increase from zero continuously as the occupation probability @xmath11 is increased , then the transition is continuous .",
    "we also measure the number of times we check the lattice to cull occupied sites not obeying their respective constraints , i.e. the culling time .",

    "tends to diverge near transition on euclidean lattices  @xcite .",

    "similarly , for the @xmath6 odd case , we study the @xmath36-core model on @xmath33 trees .",

    "first , we need to show the existence of trees of connectivity @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath6 even and odd , respectively .",
    "let us suppose @xmath6 is even .",

    "accordingly , we can build @xmath32 trees on the tessellation @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "likewise , it can be checked that for any @xmath5 , @xmath6 even and @xmath52 , it is possible to build a tree of connectivity @xmath32 .",
    "analogously , trees of connectivity @xmath33 can be built on tessellations @xmath53 where @xmath51 , and for any tessellation @xmath4 where @xmath54 is odd .    in summary , those trees necessary for our proof can be built on any tessellation @xmath4 as long as @xmath54 and for the tessellations @xmath53 , @xmath50 as long as @xmath51 .",
    "as for the second step in the proof , consider any site on the tree built in step 1 . a site of a @xmath4 tessellation will be contained in a @xmath6-gon as illustrated in fig .",

    "we estimate @xmath29 for the @xmath0-core models on the tessellation @xmath62 . for @xmath70-core , @xmath119 ; for @xmath76-core , @xmath120 ; for @xmath2-core , @xmath121 . according to eq .",
    "( [ duallattice ] ) , for ordinary percolation ( @xmath70-core ) on tessellation @xmath63 , we should have @xmath122 . in order to estimate @xmath30 numerically ( for @xmath123-core model ) , we follow the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite stating that @xmath30 is the value of @xmath11 at which the ratio the crossing probability @xmath24 becomes equal to one , for tessellations @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , the best estimate for @xmath30 for the tessellation @xmath62 is @xmath124 and for the tessellation @xmath63 , @xmath125 which roughly satifies eq .",
    "( [ duallattice ] ) .",
    "we have studied four constraint percolation models on mainly the @xmath62 hyperbolic tessellation .",
    "our data suggests that all three @xmath0-core models exhibit similar behavior , thereby falling under the universality class of ordinary percolation .",
    "this is not a surprise for @xmath76-core percolation , which has been shown to behave similarly to ordinary percolation  @xcite .",
    "however , given the mixed @xmath2-core percolation transition on bethe lattices and , yet , the continuous phase transition ( should @xmath126 ) on euclidean lattices for @xmath2-core , this result is not obvious .",
    "in fact , earlier work  @xcite of @xmath2-core percolation on hyperbolic lattices argued that the transition behaves discontinuously ( in terms of the order parameter ) . in this earlier work ,",
    "it was also proven that @xmath126 for @xmath2-core percolation on hyperbolic lattices of certain types , which is an important step in that it constrains the analysis of the data . however , there was no proof of the discontinuity .",
    "arguments and some numerical evidence were presented , so our results do not contradict mathematics .",
    "another interesting result is that the @xmath0-core models exhibit two critical probabilities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , meanwhile the force - balance model seems to exhibit just one critical probability .",
    "this comes from the fact that the force - balance condition constrains the spatial occupation of neighbors of an occupied site in such a way that the cluster tends to expand in every direction .",
    "it does not allow for the possibility of having several percolating clusters that do not overlap .    according to the behavior of the order parameter , @xmath87 , @xmath0-core models exhibit a continuous transition , while force - balance is discontinuous , at least on the @xmath62 tessellation .",
    "force - balance percolation is also discontinuous on euclidean lattices so the hyperbolic lattice does not change this property by the changing of the underlying geometry .",
    "the observation that the nature of the transition in @xmath2-core percolation does not change from euclidean lattices to hyperbolic lattices may indicate that ( the absence of ) loops are important in driving the transition towards a mixed one since on the bethe lattice there are no loops . in other words , @xmath2-core percolation may be very sensitive to loops . a @xmath127 expansion for @xmath2-core percolation demonstrated that the mixed nature of the transiton remained to order @xmath128",
    "of course , the loops are controlled perturbatively in this @xmath127 expansion , which is not the case for the hyperbolic tessellation .",
    "one must think about the effects of loops on @xmath2-core percolation to better understand the nature of its transition in all geometries .",
