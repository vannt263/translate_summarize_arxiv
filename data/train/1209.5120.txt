    "there is substantial literature in economics concerning locations and population sizes of cities , a central quantitative feature of the latter being the observation ( _ zipf s law _ ) that the number of cities with populations larger than @xmath4 scales roughly as @xmath5 .",
    "useful background can be found in the 2004 survey @xcite which describes  both bare - bone statistical theories and more developed economic theories . \"",
    "the former , exemplified by the gibrat model ( proportional growth rates of cities are random but independent of population size ) might better be called purely mathematical models , while the latter ( quoting @xcite )  reflect such important economic forces as increasing returns , congestion , trade and non - market interactions \" . but",
    "( as in the broader literature on spatial economics featured in the monograph @xcite ) most models are not truly  spatial \" in the sense that the geometry of two - dimensional space plays an essential role .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a purely mathematical model which is explicitly spatial in this sense .",
    "the model is not intended as literally realistic for cities , but rather as a novel style of model ( see discussion of related models in section [ sec - related ] ) and one for which ( unlike many explicitly spatial models in other contexts ) non - obvious properties can be derived via quite simple albeit non - rigorous arguments .",
    "at each time step @xmath6 there are cities at positions @xmath7 in the unit square @xmath8 ^ 2 $ ] , with populations @xmath9 , the total population being @xmath10 .",
    "the model has three parameters @xmath11 which are used to define a function @xmath12 interpreted as the  influence \" of a city of population @xmath13 at a point at distance @xmath14 from the city . for a position @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] define @xmath16 ( the maximum influence at that position ) and",
    "then define the _ sphere of influence _ of city @xmath17 to be the region @xmath18 in which city @xmath17 has larger influence than any other city . at time @xmath19 there is a single city of population @xmath19 at a uniform random point of @xmath8 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "if city populations were equal then the partition into spheres of influence would be just the usual voronoi tessellation @xcite ; in general one can consider it as a form of weighted voronoi tessellation .",

    "+ one could imagine many different rules to formalize these features ; while there is no necessary connection between the two features , our formulation in which both are derived via the same influence function is mathematically convenient .",
    "* given the configuration at a large time @xmath25 , the subsequent evolution over a relatively small time interval is deterministic to first order , because a city population grows at rate proportion to the area of its sphere of influence .",
    "randomness plays a role both via a  founder effect \" ( the random positions of the first few cities ) and more subtly , in the  balanced growth \" case , because the newly - founded cities at ( non - uniform ) random positions grow comparatively rapidly to attain the same order of magnitude population as the older cities .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 has a quantitative influence via the founder effect but does not affect the types of asymptotic behavior we discuss ; the model has the two essential parameters @xmath0 and @xmath27 which do affect this behavior .",
