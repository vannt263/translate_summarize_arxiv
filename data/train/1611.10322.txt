    "the next generation of dark matter detectors using liquid xenon ( lxe ) as the detection medium @xcite will probe lower interaction cross sections than ever before .",
    "one key to success for these experiments is an improved understanding of low - energy interactions in lxe .",
    "the interaction cross sections between weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and standard model particles are generally expected to increase exponentially with decreasing interaction energy .",
    "however , low - energy interactions in lxe , below a few kev , are not well - understood theoretically , and measurements of the fundamental properties of lxe at low energies that allow the interaction energy scale to be precisely defined are lacking .    for instance",
    ", systematic uncertainties on the scintillation - based energy scale have limited the search for axions @xcite and for annual modulation @xcite with xenon100 data .",
    "these systematic uncertainties could be improved by using a combined energy scale ( ces ) , that is by using both the prompt scintillation ( @xmath1 ) and ionization ( @xmath2 ) signals , provided that the anti - correlation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in lxe at low energies is well characterized .",
    "charge yield measurements of electronic recoils ( ers ) are currently most needed .",
    "lack of such measurements is the primary reason a ces was not adopted for studies of ers in xenon100 .",
    "next generation detectors using a ces will benefit from these measurements .",
    "measurements of low - energy ers from monochromatic @xmath3 rays are of particular interest for dark matter searches using lxe , as their dominant electromagnetic backgrounds in the outer layer of the detector come from such compton scatters .",
    "direct measurements have been made of the light yield of lxe due to ers from monochromatic @xmath3 rays as a function of the recoil energy down to low energies @xcite .",
    "these yields were derived from measurements of @xmath1 using single - phase lxe detectors operated at either zero drift field or at a single applied electric field .",
    "the lowest mean energy previously measured for the light yield due to ers is 1.5kev @xcite .",
    "even fewer measurements have been made of the charge yield of lxe due to ers , derived from the @xmath2 signal , since collecting the ionization electrons typically requires two - phase operation , entailing more sophisticated detectors . at the current time , no references have been found for dedicated measurements of the charge yield of ers at low energies using compton scattering of external monochromatic @xmath3-ray sources , the method employed for this work .",
    "the charge yield of ers has been measured by several groups as a function of electric field using mono - chromatic @xmath3 rays , but only at relatively high energies , e.g. 122 , 511 , and 570kev .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a review of er light and charge measurements .",
    "the light and charge yield from the decay of @xmath4kr at 9.4kev and 32.1kev has been measured @xcite , though the decay products consist primarily of several internal conversion and auger electrons , and thus are not directly comparable to measurements with monochromatic @xmath3 rays . additionally , the charge and light yield from the decay of tritium ( @xmath5h ) has been measured at two drift fields @xcite . however , as tritium is a single - beta emitter with a q - value of 18.6kev , the resulting energy spectrum is continuous , and thus monte carlo ( mc ) matching is required for the recoil energy determination .",
    "similarly , continuous spectra from the decay of @xmath6cs have been measured and an accompanying mc used to determine the charge and light yield in lxe at various drift fields @xcite .    in this paper we present results of measurements of the light and charge yield of lxe due to low - energy ers as a function of applied electric field and deposited energy .",
    "the compton coincidence technique is used to determine the amount of energy deposited in an er in the lxe .",
    "the technique , introduced in ref.@xcite and further improved in ref.@xcite , is the same technique used for the measurement of the light yield of ers described in detail in ref.@xcite . for this work",
    "we employ the same method , but now use a two - phase time projection chamber ( tpc ) , thus allowing both the charge and light yield to be measured simultaneously .",
    "science data presented here were taken during two periods , referred to as runs i and ii .",
    "the principle of the compton coincidence technique ( cct ) is to irradiate the primary detector with high - energy monochromatic @xmath3 rays , and to look for events in a second detector in prompt coincidence corresponding to the full - energy deposition of the compton - scattered @xmath3 rays .",
    "since the initial energy is known and the final energy is measured by the second detector , the energy lost in the primary detector can be determined . by placing the second detector at various angles relative to the incoming @xmath3 rays ,",
    "different recoil energy ranges can be probed in the primary detector .",
    "we measure recoils from incoming 661.7kev @xmath3 rays emitted from a 123@xmath7ci @xmath6cs source , and measure the scattered @xmath3 rays with a high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detector , as shown schematically in fig.[method_schematic ] .",
    "schematic of the experimental setup during compton coincidence measurements .",
    "monochromatic @xmath3 rays from the decay of @xmath6cs compton scatter in the lxe detector , depositing energy which results in electronic recoils .",
    "the energy of the @xmath3 rays scattering at an angle @xmath8 is measured by a hpge detector . ]",
    "the primary detector used for this measurement is a two - phase lxe tpc designed to measure both the light and charge yield of nuclear and electronic recoils in lxe , and is thus dubbed nerix .",
    "the nerix detector is the latest iteration of such detectors designed and built at columbia university for measuring the fundamental properties of lxe . as shown in fig.[detector_schematic ] , the nerix detector consists of five photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) surrounding a sensitive volume enclosed by a series of grids supported in a polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) frame .",
    "four 1 `` square pmts ( hamamatsu r8520 - 406-m4-sel ) , each with four channels , form a square top array of 16 channels in the gaseous xe above the sensitive volume .",
    "one 2 '' diameter circular pmt ( hamamatsu r6041 - 406 sel ) views the lxe volume from below .",
    "all pmts were selected for having high quantum efficiency ( qe ) , @xmath935% at the xe scintillation wavelength , 178 nm . during coincidence measurements ,",
    "the top pmt array is used for event vertex reconstruction and the bottom pmt is used for the yield determination .",
    "schematic drawing of the nerix detector . ]",
    "the ptfe support pieces are stackable and compressed vertically between two stainless steel plates via polyether ether ketone ( peek ) support rods with stainless steel springs .",
    "the springs ensure that the stack remains compressed and relatively light tight when at lxe temperature .",
    "the nearly seamless ptfe inner surface surrounding the sensitive volume ensures optimal light collection efficiency .",
    "the bottom and top pmts are mounted to separate stainless steel plates that can be translated vertically with respect to the tpc stack .",
    "to produce the electric fields in the liquid and gaseous xe , high voltage ( hv ) is applied to hexagonal mesh grids with 3 mm pitch , etched from stainless steel foil .",
    "the anode , gate , and cathode grids are 125@xmath7 m thick , and the screening grid directly above the bottom pmt is 25@xmath7 m thick , ensuring high optical transparency and good electric field uniformity .",
    "the gate and screening grids are electrically grounded , and negative hv is applied to the pmts and the cathode , while @xmath104.5kv is applied to the anode .",
    "a 56.5 mm diameter ring , made from 1.65 mm diameter cu wire is fixed 7 mm above the cathode and coaxial with the tpc .",
    "two 500m@xmath11 resistors connected to the ring divide the voltage between the cathode and gate grids , improving the linearity of the electron drift field in the sensitive volume .    the sensitive volume , that is the volume from which both light and charge signals from the lxe can be measured , is a cylinder 23.4 mm tall with a 43 mm diameter while at typical lxe temperature , between the gate and cathode grids .",
    "the volume contains a lxe target mass of approximately 97 g .",
    "a custom vacuum cryostat vessel made from 1.5 mm thick stainless steel was designed to minimize the amount of lxe and other material outside of the nerix tpc and provide the lxe level - setting mechanism .",
    "in addition , the amount of ptfe around the sensitive volume was minimized in order to reduce the likelihood that @xmath3 rays deposit energy outside of the sensitive volume .",
    "a total of @xmath02.2 kg of lxe are used to fill the detector vessel .",
    "the nerix cryogenic and purification system was adapted from that used for the measurements in ref.@xcite .",
    "an emergency recovery vessel and rupture disk were added to capture the xe gas in the case of a loss of cooling power or insulation vacuum .",
    "circulation of the xe gas through the purification loop was achieved using a diaphragm pump ( knf 143 sn.12e ) .",
    "the secondary detector is a p - type coaxial hpge detector ( ortec gem40 - 76 ) with a crystal of 63.7 mm diameter and 59.6 mm length .",
    "the typical full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) energy resolution at 1.33mev is 1.81kev , with a typical peak - to - compton ratio of 71:1 .    during coincidence measurements ,",
    "the @xmath6cs source was placed 17.6 cm horizontally from the tpc center , and the hpge detector was placed such that the center of the detector endcap was 14.6 cm horizontally from the tpc center .",
    "the positions were measured to within 1 mm using aluminum rules and an auto - leveling laser . the relative angle between the @xmath6cs and hpge detector",
    "was fixed at either 0@xmath12 or 25@xmath12 during science data taking .",
    "different configurations of the source and hpge detector positions were used for the two runs in order to study the impact of the lxe buffer volume .",
    "the bottom pmt used during run i experienced a deterioration of gain , and was thus exchanged in between the runs for another pmt of the same type and comparable qe .",
    "the data acquisition system for nerix is similar to that used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the raw data from nerix is amplified x10 ( phillips 776 ) and one copy is digitized by three 14-bit flash adcs ( caen v1724 ) at 100ms / s with 40mhz bandwidth , and stored to disk .",
    "the other copy is fed into the trigger logic system .",
    "the hpge detector provides two copies of the pre - amplified hpge signal .",
    "one copy is inverted and passed through a leading edge discriminator thus producing the hpge trigger .",
    "the other copy is amplified with a pulse - shaping amplifier using a coarse gain of x25 and a 6@xmath7s shaping time , digitized by the same caen system , and then recorded to disk . during measurements at 25@xmath12 , the raw signals from the pmts",
    "are not amplified , so as to mitigate the saturation of the digitizer due to large @xmath2 signals from higher energy interactions .",
    "signals from the pmt channels pass through a leading edge discriminator which subsequently produces the @xmath1 hardware trigger .",
    "the discriminator is updating , producing a 10ns pulse whenever an input signal is above the threshold , resulting in variable - length trigger pulses .",
    "logical operations ensure that an @xmath2 trigger is subsequently produced only for pulses longer than 100ns .",
    "measurements of the @xmath2 trigger efficiency were made using back - to - back 511kev @xmath3 rays from the decay of @xmath13na in prompt coincidence with a nai detector .",
    "the average trigger efficiency for @xmath2 with 10@xmath5pe is @xmath075% , and is thus near 100% for most recoil energies measured .",
    "fits of the observed @xmath2 spectra are corrected for this efficiency loss .",
    "the impact on the attributed charge yield is at the percent level for 1kev recoils , and diminishes with increasing recoil energy .",
    "the hardware trigger for coincidence events is formed by requiring that an @xmath2 trigger come within @xmath14@xmath7s after an hpge trigger , depending on the drift field being measured .",
    "the coincidence trigger and @xmath1 trigger are recorded to disk . a stricter time coincidence requirement between the signals from the two detectors",
    "is imposed in post - processing , as described in section[data_sel ] .",
    "calibration measurements of the pmts single pe gain were taken biweekly using a blue led .",
    "typical gains were @xmath15electrons / pe . regular calibrations of nerix with @xmath3 rays from @xmath6cs ( 662kev ) were taken to monitor the tpc performance .",
    "the typical measured light yields for @xmath6cs during runs i and ii are given in table[typical_ly ] .",
    ".typical measured light yield of nerix for the full - absorption peak of @xmath6cs ( 661.7  kev ) at various drift fields , v@xmath16 , during runs i and ii .",
    "uncertainties represent statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the posterior distributions from the mcmc",
    "are sampled in order to determine the yields in photons / kev and electrons / kev , as well as the reconstructed mean recoil energies for each run .",
    "the weighted average of the yields and reconstructed energies from runs i and ii is computed using the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature as the weights .",
    "the resulting average yields are shown in fig.[ly_ab ] .",
    "the relative deviation of the average reconstructed recoil energies from the measured recoil energies is shown in fig.[en_recon ] .",
    "relative deviation of the recoil energy as reconstructed using eq.[anticorr ] from the recoil energy as measured by the hpge detector , shown versus the measured recoil energy .",
    "the expectation of no deviation is shown as a dashed line . ]",
    "due to the finite energy resolution of the hpge detector , the range of actual recoil energies in each energy bin is broader than the nominal width .",
    "thus , while different energy bins do not share events , they are expected to overlap somewhat in terms of the actual recoil energy of events in the bins .",
    "the selected recoil energy range for each bin is shown as solid horizontal error bars in fig.[ly_ab ] .",
    "the estimated range of actual recoil energies , that is the selected energy range plus the @xmath17 hpge energy resolution , is shown as open horizontal brackets in fig.[ly_ab ] and as solid horizontal error bars in fig.[en_recon ] .",
    "since the yields are determined by dividing by the energy of each bin center , a shift in the average energy of events in each bin from this center energy would result in a systematic shift the attributed mean yield .",
    "however , it is observed that the average energy of events for each bin is within 10@xmath18 of the bin center for the lowest - energy recoil of each data type ( 1 or 2kev ) , and within 1@xmath18 of the bin center for all other bins . in all cases , the resulting shift in the attributed mean",
    "energy is negligible compared to the bin width and energy resolution of the hpge detector .",
    "the systematic effect of the binning definition and fit range of the measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 distributions on the yield determination was studied and found to impact the @xmath1 fits in the lowest @xmath19 bins for data taken at 0@xmath12 only .",
    "the average relative sizes of these effects were 16% and 9% , respectively , for the lowest energy bin , and 4% and 5% , respectively , for the following bin . by the third bin ,",
    "these effects were negligible .",
    "the corresponding systematic uncertainties in the light yield , which are recoil - energy dependent , are added in quadrature with the statistical uncertainties of the respective bins and are shown as solid vertical bars around each point in fig.[ly_ab ] and reported in tables[345v_table]-[5500v_table ] .",
    "the variation of the actual yield and differential scattering rate over the width of each energy bin can also result in a systematic shift of the attributed mean yield .",
    "given the observed variation of the measured yield between consecutive bins ( taking into account the uncertainties mentioned above ) and assuming a flat differential scattering rate , we estimate this possible shift to be at most @xmath09% for 1kev recoils , @xmath20% for recoils between 2kev and 6kev , and @xmath21% for recoils @xmath22kev .",
    "the actual size of such a systematic shift is difficult to quantify since the actual yields are unknown .",
    "this possible shift is not included in the uncertainties reported herein .    the uncertainties on the pmt gain , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 affect all points of a given data type uniformly , and are herein referred to as systematic uncertainties .",
    "the correlations between these parameters are probed by the mcmc of the global fit of the reconstructed energy , which is used to propagate the uncertainties to the final yields and reconstructed recoil energy for each run and data type .",
    "the resulting total systematic uncertainties are shown as vertical open brackets around each point in fig.[ly_ab ] and are reported in tables[345v_table]-[5500v_table ] . in fig.[en_recon ] , the vertical error bars show the statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "the final results of the light and charge yield determinations are shown in fig.[ly_ab ] and summarized in tables[345v_table]-[5500v_table ] .",
    "we observe that the light yield increases with recoil energy , attaining a maximum between @xmath26kev depending on the field , and then decreases .",
    "a similar , but opposite , trend is observed for the charge yield .",
    "the general dependence of the yield on the drift field is significant and is as expected for a charge recombination process , showing a decreasing light yield and increasing charge yield with increasing drift field .",
    "we also find that the drift field dependence of the yields diminishes with decreasing recoil energy and becomes negligible , given experimental uncertainties , below @xmath27kev .",
    "the reconstructed energies , fig.[en_recon ] , show good agreement with the anti - correlation relationship as formulated in eq.[anticorr ] for recoil energies above 3kev . below 3kev",
    "a significant deviation from expectation is observed , increasing from an average of @xmath28 at 2kev to @xmath29 at 1kev .",
    "see fig.[comp ] for a comparison of our results taken at 0.19kv / cm with recent measurements and predictions at comparable drift fields .",
    "comparison plot of lxe light yield ( top ) and charge yield ( bottom ) from ers with comparable electric field strengths .",
    "the nerix results taken at 0.19@xmath300.03kv / cm ( blue circles ) are shown together with measurements from @xcite taken at 0.18kv / cm ( magenta band and dashed line ) , measurements from @xcite taken at 0.236kv / cm ( green band and dashed line ) , and calculations from @xcite at 0.19v / cm ( blue line ) . ]",
    "distribution of scintillation signal ( top panel ) and ionization signal ( bottom panel ) for 1kev recoils at 0.48kv / cm drift field during run ii . ]",
    "we find that our results at 0.19kv / cm are generally in good agreement with recent measurements at comparable fields using continuous recoil energy bands .",
    "the measured light yield agrees very well with that in @xcite , while both are systematically lower than that in @xcite by @xmath31 on average .",
    "the measured charge yield is systematically higher than that in @xcite by @xmath32 .",
    "our results are in similarly good agreement with the nest model predictions @xcite at low energies @xmath33kev .",
    "the agreement for the light and charge yields at 0.48 , 1.02 , and 2.32kv / cm is very good , though for data at 0.19kv / cm the measured field dependence is less pronounced than that predicted by nest . for 2kev recoils ,",
    "however , we observe a slightly higher light yield than predicted by nest at all measured fields , and for 1kev recoils at 0.48kv / cm , the observed charge yield is significantly higher .",
    "fig.[en_recon ] shows that our data supports the use of a combined energy scale as defined in eq.[anticorr ] for determining er energies in lxe dark matter detectors for recoil energies above @xmath34kev .",
    "however , for recoil energies below @xmath34kev , a significant deviation from the expectation is observed . even assuming a light yield of zero at 1kev , the measured charge yield exceeds what should be possible given the accepted , recoil - energy independent average @xmath35 value .",
    "assuming an ionization potential of 11.7ev for lxe , the maximum number of quanta that can be produced for 1kev recoils is @xmath36 , which is greater than the measured charge yield , but in agreement given experimental uncertainties .",
    "a threshold effect on the @xmath2 signal could plausibly cause an apparent rise in the charge yield .",
    "however , the measured @xmath2 trigger efficiency is incorporated in the analysis .",
    "furthermore , the observed @xmath2 spectra for 1kev recoils , see fig.[s2_dist_lowe ] and [ s2_1kev ] , show no evidence of significant asymmetry . in addition , reducing the energy bin width to 0.5kev for the data taken at 0.48kv / cm drift field results in a nearly identical charge yield at 1kev .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the high charge yield at 1kev is due to a rate or binning effect .    a threshold effect on the @xmath1 signal ,",
    "e.g. a loss of the @xmath1 peak identification efficiency of the raw data processing software as well as the decrease in @xmath1 detection efficiency due to the expected statistical limitations mentioned in sec[yield ] , could also potentially cause such an apparent rise in the charge yield . however , dropping the @xmath1 requirement for the @xmath2 spectra ensures that such effects can have no impact .",
    "thus , we conclude that the observed rise in the charge yield is likely not artificial , and may instead indicate that the combined energy scale as described in eq.[anticorr ] breaks down at very low energies , namely that the average @xmath35 value may be energy dependent .",
