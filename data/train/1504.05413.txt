    "blazars are the most extreme active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with a relativistic jet directed towards our line of sight ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . the emission from the jets is highly boosted and dominates the agn emission at all wavelengths due to a relativistic beaming effect ( sbarrato et al .",
    "blazars are generally divided into two subcategories including bl lac objects ( bl lacs ) and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "bl lacs only have very weak or no emission lines , whereas fsrqs show strong emission lines . the classical division between fsrqs and bl lacs is mainly based on the rest frame equivalent width ( ew ) of their broad emission lines .",
    "particularly , if the ew is larger than @xmath3 , the objects are classified as fsrqs , otherwise as bl lacs ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "the broad emission lines of fsrqs are produced by distant gas clouds in broad - line regions ( blrs ) which are photoionized by the optical / uv continua radiated from the accretion disks surrounding massive black holes ( sbarrato et al .",
    "the difference of the broad line emission between fsrqs and bl lacs may be attributed to their different central engines ( cavaliere & delia 2002 ; cao 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "landt et al .",
    "( 2004 ) introduced an analogous classification criterion and found that it is possible to discriminate between objects with intrinsically weak or strong narrow emission lines by studying the @xmath4}$ ] and @xmath5}$ ] ew plane .",
    "abdo et al . ( 2010a ) have classified blazars based on the synchrotron - peak frequency of the broadband sed .",
    "ackermann et al .",
    "( 2011 ) used the estimated value of @xmath6 to classify the sources as either a low - synchrotron - peaked blazar ( lsp , for sources with @xmath7 ) , an intermediate - synchrotron - peaked blazar ( isp , for @xmath8 ) , or a hsp blazar ( if @xmath9 hz ) .",
    "radio galaxies are often thought to be the parent population of blazars .",
    "the blazars are aligned to our line of sight , radio galaxies have their jets oriented at larger viewing angle ( urry & padovani 1995 ; sbarrato et al . 2014 ) .",
    "radio galaxies are commonly divided into two subclasses including fri and frii based on their radio morphology ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "fri shows bright jets close to the nucleus , while frii shows prominent hot spots are far from it .",
    "the fri and frii radio galaxies can be clearly divided in the host galaxy optical luminosity - radio luminosity ( @xmath10 ) plane by a dividing line showing that radio power is proportional to the optical luminosity of the host galaxy ( ledlow & owen 1996 ) .",
    "wu and cao ( 2008 ) found that the dividing line of the ledlow - owen relation for fri / frii can be roughly reproduced by using the maximum jet power available from adafs around kerr black hole as a function of black hole mass with a hybrid jet formation model ( i.e. , bp+bz mechanism ) .",
    "however , what causes the fri / frii division is still unclear .",
    "gopal - krishna and wiita ( 2000 ) suggested that the differences between fri and frii may be caused by the jets interact with the ambient medium with different physical properties .",
    "however , some authors thought that the differences between fri and frii may be the intrinsic difference of their central engines , such as different accretion models and the formation process of jets ( e.g. , baum et al .",

    "2004 ; hardcastle et al .",
    "ghisellini and celotti ( 2001 ) found that the division between fri and frii actually reflected a systematic difference in accretion rate .",
    "the fris have generally lower accretion rate ( @xmath11 ) , while for frii it was typically larger .",
    "some authors also found that the fsrqs and bl lacs can be divided in @xmath12 ( see e.g. narayan , carcia & mcclintock 1997 ; ghisellini , maraschi & tavecchio 2009 ) .",
    "they suggested that the fri and frii could correspond to different accretion models .",
    "laing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) suggested that friis can be divided into high - excitation ( heg ) and low - excitation galaxies ( legs ) , which are also applied to some fri .",
    "buttiglione et al.(2009,2010 ) found that all heg are frii , while legs can be both fri and frii .",
    "best & heckman ( 2012 ) suggested that heg radio galaxies are fuelled at high rates through radiatively - efficient standard accretion disks , while leg radio galaxies are fulled via radiatively inefficient flows at low accretion rates .",
    "heckman & best ( 2014 ) suggested that most fris are leg sources , and most friis are heg sources .",
    "gendre et al .",
    "( 2013 ) suggested that the leg and heg sources could be divided by the ledlow and owen s line .",
    "these results may suggested that the fsrqs vs frii and bl lac vs fri unification can be easily reinterpreted physically as heg / leg because of the large population overlaps between hegs and frii and between legs and fri .    in the frame of unification schemes ,",
    "many authors have studied the unified scheme of fsrqs and frii radio galaxies .",
    "padovani and urry ( 1992 ) found that the radio luminosity functions ( rlfs ) of frii radio galaxies are consistent with the observed radio luminosity functions of fsrqs , which favor the unification of frii radio galaxies and fsrqs .",
    "analogously , the unified scheme of bl lac objects and fri radio galaxies has been extensively studied by many authors who used different approaches , such as comparison of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in different wavebands and radio morphology ( owen et al .",
    "1996 ; capetti et al . 2000 ; bai & lee 2001 ) .",
    "padovani and urry ( 1991 ) derived that the rlfs of bl lacs are consistent with the observed rlfs of fri radio galaxies , which also favor the unification of bl lacs and fri radio galaxies . since the launch of the fermi satellite , we have entered in a new era of blazars research ( abdo et al .",

    ", the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) has detected hundreds of blazars because it has about 20 folds better sensitivity than its predecessor egret in the 0.1 - 100 gev energy rang .",
    "sbarrato et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found a good correlation between the broad line luminosity and radio luminosity , which suggested a direct tight connection between jet power and accretion rate .",
    "they got that the observational differences between blazar subclasses reflect differences in the accretion regime .",
    "blandford and rees ( 1978 ) suggested that the radiation observed from blazars is dominated by the emission from relativistiv jets , which transport energy and momentum to large scales .",
    "however , the formation of jets is not still unclear in astrophysics ( e.g. meier et al .",
    "many models have been proposed to explain the origin of jets .",
    "there are two main theoretical models of the formation of jet .",
    "one is that the rotational energy of the black hole is expected to be transferred to the jets by the magnetic fields threading the holes when assuming the black hole is spinning rapidly ( i.e. , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "another one is that the jet can also be accelerated by the large - scale fields threading the rotating accretion disk ( i.e. , the blandford - payne ( bp ) mechanism ; blandford & payne 1982 ) . in the bz theory",
    ", gosh & marek ( 1997 ) found that it is possible to find two regimes for standard disc , which may be dominated by the radiation pressure ( rpd ) or the gas pressure ( gpd ) .",
    "foschini ( 2011 ) suggested that the fsrqs and narrow - line seyfert 1 are in rpd regime , while bl lacs are basically in the gpd regime by using the data of 30 fsrqs and 9 bl lacs from ghisellini et al .",

    "in this work , we have explored the relationship between fsrqs , bl lacs , fri - leg and frii - heg radio galaxies .",
    "our main results are the following :    \\(i ) according to study the @xmath73 and @xmath74 plane , we find two different regimes .",
    "one is the jet power depends on the accretion and another is the jet power depends on the black hole mass .",
    "fsrqs and frii - heg are in the rpd regime ( mass - dependent regime ) , while bl lacs and fri - leg are in the gpd regime ( accretion - dependent regime ) .",
    "\\(ii ) through studying the ratio of between the jet power and the calculated the luminosity according to the blandford - znajek theory versus the eddington ratios plane , we find that the most of both fsrqs and frii - heg and both bl lacs and fri - leg have @xmath0 , which suggests that the bz mechanism is insufficient to explain the jet power of these objects .",
    "there is need to invoke alternative or additional mechanism to explain the jet power of these objects .",
    "we also find a small number of fsrqs and bl lacs have @xmath52 , which may indicate that the bz mechanism is sufficient to explain the jet power of this small number of fsrqs and bl lacs .",
    "\\(iv ) the eddington ratios @xmath75 of bl lacs are systematically lower than those of fsrqs in our sample with a clearly division at @xmath2 . the eddington distributions of bl lacs and fsrqs exhibit a bimodal nature , which imply that the accretion mode of bl lacs may be different from that of fsrqs .",
    "\\(v ) we find a significant correlation between jet power and broad line luminosity in agns , which supports the close connection between jet power and accretion .",
