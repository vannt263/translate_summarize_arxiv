    "throughout the history of quantum physics , first - order correlations have played a major role in discussing the foundations of the underlying theory .",
    "one of the most famous model system is young s double - slit , which despite its simplicity allows to explore fundamental questions such as complementarity and uncertainty relations  @xcite .",
    "a modern realization of young s experiment involves two atoms scattering near - resonant laser light  @xcite .",
    "the light is thus scattered by the simplest form of a regular structure , which gives rise to interference phenomena in the scattered light , because different indistinguishable pathways connect source and detector  @xcite .",
    "analogous interference is also possible with single particles , demonstrating pathway interference in the energy - time domain  @xcite .    starting with the experiments by hanbury - brown and twiss  @xcite involving the measurement on a thermal field and the corresponding measurement with anti - bunched resonance fluorescence light  @xcite ,",
    "the second - order correlation function gained considerable attention .",
    "this correlation function measures intensity correlations and thus provides information on the fluctuation of the fields  @xcite .    in general , spatial interference in the different correlation functions can only be expected under certain experimental conditions .",
    "for example , it is possible to have interference in the second - order correlation function under conditions of no interference of the first - order correlation function  @xcite .",
    "in particular the first order interference in light scattered of regular structures of atoms is typically restricted to low incident light intensity and vanishes at strong driving  @xcite .",
    "for example , in a two - particle system in the strong field limit , the collective dressed states are uniformly populated , and thus the interference fringe visibility is zero .",
    "since applications often rely on these interference effects  @xcite , this restricts the potential implementation , where properties such as coherence , increased resolution , high signal - to - noise ratios or a rapid coherent system evolution are among the desirable properties of the scattered light .",
    "more fundamentally , different lines of the frequency spectrum of the scattered light become separated in the strong - field limit , just as in the mollow resonance fluorescence spectrum of a single strongly - driven two - level atom .",
    "we have shown recently that this separation can be employed to recover full first - order interference fringe visibility in the strong - field limit , and to gain a clearer interpretation and an extended set of observables to describe the scattered light  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea was to facilitate a frequency - dependent electromagnetic bath , which can be realized , for example , using cavities or photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "the focus of this work , however , was on first - order correlation functions .    here , we discuss spatial second - order quantum interference effects in strong driving fields . as in the strong - field limit",
    "the spectral lines are well - separated , we define observables for each of the spectral lines separately .",
    "this allows for additional observables such as cross - correlations between different the spectral lines .",
    "first , we investigate the spatial dependence of the second - order correlation functions for a strongly driven atomic pair in free space and focus on the case of a single two - photon detector registering photons at the driving laser frequency @xmath0 , as , for example , in lithography with a medium sensitive to two - photon exposure .",
    "we show that in this setup , the spatial resolution of the central strong - field second - order interference pattern can be increased by a factor of two as compared to the corresponding weak - field pattern simply by increasing the driving field intensity .",
    "this allows to create structures with high spatial resolution and signal intensity .",
    "next , quantum cross - correlations between photons emitted in different spectral bands are investigated .",
    "in particular , we show that the spatial cauchy - schwarz inequalities ( csi ) are violated for photons emitted into the sideband spectral lines over a wide range of detector positions .",
    "also , it is impossible to predict the temporal ordering of two photons emitted in different sidebands . our scheme can be realized in a wide range of systems , and can also be employed to analyze the structure of the scatterers .",
    "finally , we generalize our results to the case of a linear chain of @xmath1 atoms , where the results are found to be different from results in dicke - type samples .     a linear structure of two - state emitters , where neighboring atoms are separated by the distance vectors @xmath2 .",
    "the whole structure is driven by a resonant strong external laser field with wave vector @xmath3 .",
    "the two detectors are used to measure correlations among the photons emitted in observation directions @xmath4 , which are also characterized by the angles @xmath5 between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",

    "we first concentrate on a driven pair of distinguishable non - overlapping two - state emitters , labeled @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and generalize the discussion to a linear structure of @xmath8 atoms in section  [ multi ] .",

    "we found violation of the spatial cauchy - schwarz inequalities for photons emitted into the spectral sidebands , and that it is impossible to predict which photon is emitted first .",
    "multiparticle atomic structures significantly enhance the intensity of the emitted correlated photons , and exhibit properties different from those in dicke - type multiparticle samples .",
