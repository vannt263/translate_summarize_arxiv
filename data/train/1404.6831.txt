    "physicists conduct experiments through iterative cycles of design , testing , and refinement , yet undergraduate physics students rarely have opportunities to do the same  @xcite.while laboratory ( lab ) courses can provide opportunities for authentic practice , they often employ uninspiring recipe - style activities with little emphasis on designing , building , or troubleshooting experimental approaches  @xcite .",
    "this has prompted numerous calls to reform physics lab experiences  @xcite , with some arguing authentic inquiry should begin as early as students freshman year  @xcite to improve student persistence in physical science majors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there is growing recognition that physics education must focus on self - learning , critical thinking , collaboration and other such skills to help students succeed  @xcite .",
    "this paper describes a transformed lab course called _ intro to measurement _ , the third and final course in the berkeley compass project s three - part sequence for first - year undergraduate students  @xcite .",
    "the course borrows elements from other transformed lab courses known to be effective  @xcite and enhances them with attention to the sociocultural aspects of learning physics  @xcite .",
    "_ intro to measurement _ is grounded in the compass value of supporting students holistically  @xcite , which means working with students on inter- and intra - personal challenges that may affect their academic success in addition to teaching them science concepts and practices .",
    "this is accomplished by developing a strong student learning community through a summer bridge program ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and strengthening that community through collaborative , project - based coursework during the academic year . by fostering close communities within cohorts of students ,",
    "compass seeks to provide a network of support that empowers undergraduate students , particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds  @xcite , to complete physical sciences degrees .",
    "as the final freshman - level compass course , _ intro to measurement _ is intended to help first - year undergraduates develop the skills necessary to be successful as lifelong science learners through guided self - reflection , personalized instructor feedback , and authentic research practices .",
    "the cycle of student self - reflection and instructor feedback described herein is a strategy for providing students with sociocultural support , which is particularly important for students from underrepresented groups in the sciences .",
    "this type of support can take many forms , including : buffering critical feedback by highlighting high expectations and assuring students of their capacity to succeed  @xcite ; responding to struggling students by presenting them with strategies for improvement  @xcite ; increasing students confidence and enhancing their self - efficacy  @xcite ; and generally promoting in students a _ growth mindset _ , _ i.e. _ , the belief that intelligence is malleable and can be changed with effort  @xcite . in addition , fostering supportive student / instructor relationships addresses some of the major factors contributing to student attrition in the sciences , namely , the perception of faculty as unapproachable and the rejection of faculty and teaching assistants as role models  @xcite .    the major connection between the laboratory and reflection activities lies not in anticipated outcomes for students , but in the framing of the activities themselves : in the former context , students are working to improve an experimental apparatus or procedure ; in the latter , they are working to improve themselves as learners .",
    "our goal is not to make quantitative connections between the outcomes of these two activities , but instead to document the compass approach to blending lab instruction with holistic student support .",
    "we report on a study of 80% of the 10 students who completed a recent iteration of _ intro to measurement_. the present work has three goals : to document the design of a laboratory course based on compass holistic learning principles , to understand the course s impact on students measurement concepts , and to describe students reflections and corresponding instructor feedback as related to development of lifelong learning skills .",
    ".[tab:0]demographic breakdown of participants ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the small size of the cohort in the present work , it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the relative impact of our intervention on students reasoning about scientific measurement and uncertainty .",
    "we can , however , provide context for these results by considering previous studies of point and set paradigms in student reasoning . specifically , we consider studies in which the pmq was used to measure shifts in reasoning in both traditional  @xcite and reformed  @xcite introductory physics lab courses at the university of cape town and in which a survey based on the pmq was used to evaluate a reformed lab course at the university of maryland  @xcite . each of the studies involved 50 - 120 students , a much larger population than is considered in the present work .",
    "consistent with the reform courses at maryland  @xcite and cape town  @xcite , our students had relatively large shifts towards set - like reasoning in comparing data sets ( see table  [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , students in the traditional lab courses at cape town  @xcite did not show such gains .",
    "we analyzed 73 student reflections and the related instructor feedback from the weekly written reflections over the course of the semester .",
    "in 54 of 73 reflections , students explicitly stated the skills they were focused on ( e.g. , saying `` this week i will focus on self - compassion '' ) . in 12 of the remaining 19 reflections , students used language directly from the rubrics without explicitly stating the skill ( e.g. , writing about `` frustration '' reflects language in the persistence skill prompt ) .",
    "the remaining 7 reflections did not follow the prompt for any particular skill .",
    "students were not limited to one skill per reflection ; in fact , 30% of the reflections contained two or more learning skills .    the most popular skills for reflection were organization ( 35% ) , connections ( 18% ) , persistence ( 15% ) , self - compassion ( 9% ) , and courage ( 8% ) .",
    "the other skills were only reflected on a few times each .",
    "thus , more than half of the reflections focused on just three skills , namely , organization , connections , and persistence .",
    "reflections related to organization focused primarily on time management ( 86% ) .",
    "most of these reflections referred to time management specifically ; others used phrases like , `` i want to be efficient with the little time i ve got , '' or `` i did not have the time to keep up with my work . ''",
    "most students were not used to the work load of college , and struggled to keep up .",
    "students made statements such as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` due to the volume of work to be done ( and the limited length of time ) , i sometimes find myself going through the motions  '' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    and ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` i stayed up all night and managed to get 2 and a half hours of sleep last night . ''",

    "we note that the rubric treats building connections as a distinct skill from collaboration which includes , among other things , working productively with others ( appendix a ) .",
    "in contrast , reflections about persistence did not have any clear themes .",
    "students reflected on many different areas , such as : staying focused and not giving up on long homework assignments , personal difficulties staying focused on school , and continuing towards a college degree despite feeling unsuccessful .",
    "instructor responses to student reflections focused on a variety of themes . to support students holistically ,",
    "instructor responses typically included both an affective and instructive component .",
    "the affective responses focused on supporting students through personal struggles they faced ; here are examples of the types of affective responses instructors gave :    * affirmation : `` i , personally , am glad you are a part of compass and physics so that i ve had a chance to get to know you . ''",
    "* empathizing : `` figuring out that it is okay and even beneficial to drop a class is something that is hard to deal with .",
    "i know this is something i struggled with as a student . ''",
    "* normalizing : `` impostor syndrome  basically means that you think you are the only one struggling and eventually everyone else will figure out that you do nt understand things as well .",
    "everyone ( including myself ) thinks this from time to time . ''    on the instructive side of feedback , the instructors suggested resources or strategies that students could use to improve their physics learning .",
    "they also suggested resources that could help students be more successful in their college transition .    * suggesting strategies : `` [ m]ake sure you get the most out of every problem you do .",
    "what i mean is to take a few moments after you read a problem and think generally about what concepts or techniques might be useful before you start working .",
    "after you finish the problem , reflect on what you did . ''",
    "* pointing to resources : `` prof .",
    "[ smith ] teaches a class that uses root for some of the homeworks .",
    "his website is here : '' * non - academic support : `` have you looked at padmapper.com for apartments ?",
    "it is useful for off campus housing and it is how i found my apartment . ''",
    "most instructor responses included some aspect of affective support ( 82% ) and concrete instructions for working on a challenge ( 85% ) .",
    "the quality of student and instructor interactions suggested collegial , supportive , and non - traditional student - instructor relationships , which may be connected to students persistence in the sciences  @xcite and warrants future study .",
    "the compass project s _ intro to measurement _ course provides an example of a physics laboratory course that emphasizes the iterative nature of research practice through authentic inquiry projects . by using uncertainty analysis to inform improvements on their experimental designs and theoretical models ,",
    "students developed greater understanding of the nature of measurement .",
    "this course further supported students in development of lifelong learning skills through guided self - reflection and personalized instructor feedback . the reflection and",
    "feedback process provided students with affective support , a unique feature of the course .",
    "student responses to the pmq showed that nearly all 8 of the students in the study achieved set - like reasoning by the end of the course .",
    "however , gains in student understanding of the nature of measurement were limited by the ceiling effect . on the pre - instruction survey ,",
    "half of students were already using set - like reasoning most of the time , and none of the students used point - like reasoning most of the time .",
    "most of the students had already completed a compass class or attended the compass summer program , which also emphasize authentic science experiences and metacognitive skills .",
    "this suggests that we should administer future questionnaires to compass students before the summer program to better assess gains from compass interventions .",
    "further research is required to develop a large enough data set to confirm any trends about gains seen in set like reasoning .",
    "student reflections and instructor responses supported meaningful exchanges about topics ranging from coping with the workload of college to dealing with impostor syndrome .",
    "an analysis of students reflections showed that students focused primarily on three areas : organization , connections , and persistence .",
    "moreover , analysis of responses within these categories showed that the majority of students focused on the same issues , such as time management and networking with others .",
    "meanwhile , instructor responses included both affective and instructive components , simultaneously empathizing with students challenges and pointing them towards strategies and resources to help them overcome those challenges .",
    "we believe that targeted support for students to focus lifelong learning skills could be a promising direction for future research .    given the importance of authentic introductory lab coursework  @xcite and supportive student - instructor relationships  @xcite to students persistence in the sciences , _ intro to measurement _ plays an important role in ongoing efforts by compass to promote retention in the sciences at uc berkeley , particularly among students from underrepresented groups .",
    "moreover , due to the introductory nature of the physics concepts covered in the course , elements of _ intro to measurement _ may be adapted for use in high school settings .",
    "the thermal expansion experiment , for instance , is an ideal activity for engaging high school students in developing and using models , analyzing and interpreting data , and other scientific and engineering practices outlined in the _ next generation science standards _  @xcite .",
    "finally , the case of the _ intro to measurement _ course represents an intersection of educational transformation and student empowerment .",
    "in contrast to both traditional , faculty - led transformation efforts  ( cf . , ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as cogenerative reform processes where teachers and their students work together to identify pedagogical improvements  ( cf . ,",
    "@xcite ) , _ intro to measurement _ was designed , implemented , and refined exclusively by graduate and undergraduate students  @xcite .",
    "such authentic engagement of students as leaders is considered a fundamental aspect of promoting student voice  @xcite .",
    "moreover , research on institutional transformation highlights that change efforts which do not afford the actors involved in the change efforts such agency are much less likely to be effective  @xcite .",
    "while the general compass approach to educational and organizational reform is outlined elsewhere  @xcite , future studies are needed to fully understand the impact of student - led course transformation efforts .",
