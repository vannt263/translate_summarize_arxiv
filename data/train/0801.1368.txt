    "more than 250 planets have been detected around both solar and non - solar type stars .",
    "recent development of radial velocity techniques and accumulation of observations have revealed detailed orbital distribution of close - in planets .",
    "figure [ fig : exso]@xmath0 shows the distribution of semi - major axis and eccentricity for 236 planets discovered around solar type stars by the radial velocity techniques .",
    "the dotted line shows a pericenter distance @xmath1 au . at @xmath2 au",
    ", many close - in planets have small eccentricities , which are accounted for by the circularization due to the tidal dissipation of energy within the planetary envelopes ( rasio & ford 1996 ) .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution of discovered extrasolar planets shows double peaks around 0.05 au and 1 au ( e.g. , marcy et al . 2005 ; jones et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the location of the outer peak is determined by the observational limits , but the inner peak at around 0.05 au , in other words shortage of planets between 0.060.8 au , would be real . since the close - in planets have relatively small eccentricities , the peak around 0.05 au appears as a pile up at @xmath3 also in pericenter distribution ( fig .  [",
    "fig : exso]@xmath4 ) .",
    "the close - in planets are also found in the multi - planetary systems . up to now ,",
    "23 multi - planet systems are reported with known planetary eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multi ] ) .",
    "the discovered close - in planets would have been formed at large distances beyond the ice line and migrated to shorter - period orbits ( e.g. , ida & lin 2004a , 2004b ) . a promising mechanism for the orbital migration is `` type ii '' migration ( e.g. , lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ) .",
    "this is the migration with disk accretion due to gap opening around the planetary orbit caused by gravitational interaction between the planet and the protoplanetary gas disk .",
    "this mechanism can account for not only the pile - up of the close - in planets but also planetary pairs locked in mean - motion resonances .",
    "the migrating planets may have stalled as they enter the magnetospheric cavity in their nascent disks or interact tidally with their host stars .",
    "however , several close - in ( @xmath5au ) planets such as hat - p-2 , hd118203b , and hd162020b have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath6 ) , but are not accompanied by nearby secondary large planets .",
    "hd17156b with @xmath7au may also belong to this group , since it has very large eccentricity ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 as small as 0.05au .",
    "it may be difficult for the planet - disk interaction alone to excite the eccentricities up to these levels .",
    "one possible mechanism for the excitation to the moderate eccentricity for close - in planets in multiple - planet systems is the passage of secular resonances during the epoch of disk depletion ( nagasawa , tanaka , & ida 2000 ; nagasawa , lin , & ida 2003 ; nagasawa & lin 2005 ) .",
    "nagasawa and lin ( 2005 ) showed that the relativity effect and the gravity of ( distant ) secondary planets excite the eccentricity of close - in planet orbiting around a slowly rotating host star .",
    "although a main channel to form close - in planets may be type ii migration , inward scatterings by other giant planets can be another channel , in particular for the close - in planets with moderate eccentricities .",
    "in relatively massive and/or metal - rich disks , multiple gas giants are likely to form ( e.g. , kokubo & ida 2002 ; ida & lin 2004a , 2004b , 2008 ) . on longer timescales than formation timescales , the multiple gas giant systems can be orbitally unstable ( lin & ida 1997 ; marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ) .",
    "in many cases , a result of orbital crossing is that one of the planets is ejected and the other planets remain in well separated eccentric orbits ( `` jumping jupiters '' model ; e.g. , rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; lin & ida 1997 ) .",
    "recent studies of the jumping jupiter model show pretty good coincidence with the observational eccentricity distribution ( marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ; chatterjee , ford , & rasio 2007 ; ford & rasio 2007 ) .    with the sufficiently small pericenter distance ( @xmath10 au )",
    ", the planetary orbit can be circularized into the close - in orbit by tidal effects from the star ( rasio & ford 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", the process of planet - planet scattering followed by the tidal circularization will be referred to as `` scattering model . '' to send a planet into the inner orbit , the other planets have to lose their orbital energy . since",
    "inward scattering of a lighter planet is more energy saving , the systems which experienced the planet - planet scattering tend to have smaller planets inside .",
    "we might see the tendency in figure [ fig : multi ] , but it is also true that radial velocity technique tends to detect heavier planets in outer regions .",
    "note that since outer planets have negligible orbital energy , the energy conservation can not restrict the semi - major axes of the outer planets and the outer planets may be located to the regions far beyond the radial velocity technique limit ( marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ) .",
    "observation of rossiter - mclaughlin effect for 5 transiting close - in planets including hat - p-2 with eccentricity @xmath11 show that their orbital planes are almost aligned with the stellar spin axes ( narita et al .",
    "2007 ; winn et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 , 2007 ; wolf et al .",
    "2007 ) , which may suggest that the scattering mechanism is not a main channel for formation of close - in planets , because the close scattering may excite orbital inclination as well as eccentricity ( note that as shown in  3.4 , the orbital inclinations of close - in planets formed by the scattering model are not necessarily high ) .",
    "since hd17156b with @xmath12 is also transiting , the observation of rossiter - mclaughlin effect will be important .",
    "more serious problem of the scattering model may be the probability for pericenter distances to become small enough ( in other words , for eccentricities to become close enough to unity ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) ) to allow tidal circularization . in a system with only two giant planets ,",
    "the energy conservation law keeps the ratio of semi - major axes close to the initial value ( see  [ subsec : ppscat ] ) . in such system ,",
    "the probability for final planets with a large ratio of semi - major axes and very large eccentricity is @xmath14% ( ford , havlickova , & rasio 2001 ) . in a system with more giant planets ,",
    "the situation is slightly improved , especially when planets have non - zero inclinations .",
    "the close - in planets are very rare just after the scattering , but when they take into account the longer orbital evolution , the probability of the candidates for close - in planets increases to @xmath1510 % ( weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ; marzari & weidenschilling 2002 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "the contributed planets are planets in kozai state ( see  3.5 ) .    here",
    "we revisit the scattering model through orbital integration of three giant planets with direct inclusion of the tidal circularization effects and analytical argument of kozai effect .",
    "we find that the probability for formation of close - in planets is remarkably increased to @xmath1530% .",
    "although the previous studies were concerned with orbital states after stabilization by ejection of some planet(s ) , we find that the orbital circularization occurs through `` kozai migration '' ( wu 2003 ; wu & murray 2003 ) caused by outer planets , mostly during three - planet orbital crossing , after a tentative separation of the inner planet and the outer planets .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe orbital instability of a planetary system (  [ subsec : ppscat ] ) and the orbital evolution that becomes important after the system enters stable state : tidal circularization (  [ subsec : tide ] ) and kozai mechanism (  [ subsec : kozai ] ) . following description of its models and assumptions , we present results of numerical simulations in  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "we show typical outcome of the scattering (  [ subsec : resultscat ] ) , how the planets are circularized into short - period orbits (  [ subsec : resulteach ] ) , and its probability (  [ subsec : resultcir ] ) . in  [ sec : analy ] we present analytical arguments .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we carry out orbital integration of three equal - mass ( @xmath16 ) giant planets with physical radii @xmath17 rotating around a host star with mass @xmath18 .",
    "interaction with disk gas is neglected .",
    "we consider the case in which the timescale of orbital crossing to occur is longer than disk lifetime ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the orbits are integrated until one planets is tidally circularized , two planets are ejected , or the system becomes stable after one planet is ejected and the others are orbitally well separated .",
    "but , we keep integrating long enough after the orbital stabilization to see kozai mechanism that occurs on longer timescales . to understand the numerical results , in this section , we briefly summarize key processes for our calculations : orbital instability , tidal circularization , and kozai mechanism .",
    "in the present paper , jupiter - mass planets ( @xmath19 ) and a solar - mass host star ( @xmath20 ) are adopted . in the following , we use @xmath0 for semi - major axis , @xmath21 for eccentricity , @xmath22 for inclination , and @xmath23 for argument of pericenter . when we distinguish the planets , we use subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 from inner to outer planets .",

    "the values @xmath33 and @xmath34 weakly depend on @xmath16 and number of planets .",

    "chatterjee et al . ( 2007 ) derived an empirical formula that is not skewed towards greater timescales : the median of @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 . since the resonances modify @xmath30 , especially in systems with massive planets , a real timescale is sometimes much shorter than above timescale .",
    "but these expressions are helpful to know how long we need to continue the simulations .",
    "note that semi - major axis of an final innermost planet ( @xmath42 ) is limited by energy conservation when only mutual scattering is considered . in an extreme case ,",
    "in which the other planets are sufficiently far away ( @xmath43 ; @xmath44 ) , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the initial semi - major axis of planet @xmath27 and @xmath47 is number of planets .",
    "the equation implies that @xmath42 should be larger than @xmath48 .",
    "that means close - in planets are hardly formed as a result of direct scattering of a few planets that are originated from the regions beyond several au like jupiter and saturn .      as shown above",
    ", the planet - planet scattering can not make the orbital period of a planet as short as a few days , as long as the energy is conserved .",
    "however , if energy is dissipated in the planetary interior by tidal force from the host star , a planet with a few day period can be formed . with @xmath21",
    "highly excited to a value close to unity , the pericenter of the planet can approach to its host star , since pericenter distance is given by @xmath49 . then , both @xmath21 and @xmath0 are decreased with keeping @xmath9 almost constant by the tidal dissipation .",
    "the tidal dissipation is a strong function of @xmath9 .",
    "as the scattered planets normally have highly eccentric orbits , we only consider dynamic tide . in our simulation",

    "the final @xmath21 are not necessarily damped fully and distributed in a range of 00.4 in sets t , and the final @xmath0 are larger than that in set v.    the inclination distribution is shown in figure [ fig : histi ] in the cases of set n ( panel @xmath0 ) and set t1 ( panel @xmath4 ) .",
    "solid lines show the distribution of only innermost planets .",
    "dashed lines show that of all remaining planets ( inner @xmath160 outer planets ) .",
    "the overall distributions show no difference between models with and without tide .",
    "most planets keep relatively small inclinations as chatterjee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) claimed .",
    "however , the close - in planets shown in panel @xmath161 tend to have relatively large inclination , because the kozai migration is effective for planets injected to highly inclined ( @xmath162 ) orbits so that close - in planets formed with this model selectively have highly inclined orbits . in the kozai mechanism , however , the inclination takes lower values when the eccentricity is higher .",
    "the tidal circularization occurs when the eccentricity is high .",
    "thus the close - in planet is formed more easily when the inclination takes lower values in kozai cycle .",
    "this effect inhibits over - density at the highest inclination and results in rather broad inclination distribution .",
    "note that we did not include any damping mechanisms for inclination , which generally have very long timescales .",
    "our model shows that non - negligible fraction of close - in planets have retrograde rotation ( @xmath163 ) with respect to the equator of the host star , although the retrograde planets can be tidally unstable on longer timescales .",
    "since type ii migration can not produce retrograde rotation , if such retrograde planets are discovered , it would be a proof of some contribution of the scattering model to formation of close - in planets .",
    "the fraction of runs in which close - in planets are formed is shown in table [ tab : set ] for each model .",
    "it is @xmath1530% almost independent of the detailed model for tidal circularization .",
    "this is much higher than the probability ( @xmath164% ) of formation of close - in planet candidates predicted by marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) .",
    "we found that in @xmath165 of runs that form close - in planets , the planets are produced during three - planet interactions . in the residual @xmath166 runs , the close - in planets",
    "are formed after one of the planet is ejected from the system and the system becomes stable .",
    "the difference between our result and the prediction by marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) comes from the fact that marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) were concerned only with the latter cases after stabilization and did not pay attention to the former cases that contribute much more .",
    "the latter circularization cases is 68% in total simulations , which is consistent with the estimation of marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) .",
    "tidal circularization models we used could be too strong , since we use the formula of dynamic tide even after the eccentricity is significantly damped . however , even if a more realistic model is used , the result would not change significantly .",
    "we used 5 different tidal circularization models . among our models ,",
    "the damping force is the weakest in set t4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : deleng ] ) . in this case , only planets with @xmath90 au are circularized . nevertheless , the probability for formation of close - in planets is still as high as @xmath167% .",
    "the relatively high probability is resulted by repeated kozai mechanisms that are inherent in the scattering of three giant planets .",
    "figure [ fig : nonlong ] shows an example of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 evolution without tidal force .",
    "the evolution of semi - major axis of this example is shown in figure [ fig : nonlonga ] . during the initial phase ( @xmath168 years )",
    "in which all the planets repeat mutual close encounters , their eccentricity is chaotically changed .",
    "after a planet is scattered into an inner orbit of @xmath169 au , its orbital change is mostly regulated by secular variation . anti - correlation between the magnitude of @xmath21 and that of @xmath22 shows that the planet is in kozai state . as we will explain in the next section , the maximum eccentricity during kozai cycle is determined mainly by value of @xmath25 , almost independent of the location and mass of the perturbing planet .",
    "since there is no energy dissipation in this run ( even with tidal circularization , energy dissipation is practically negligible as long as @xmath170 au ) , the isolation of the innermost planet is tentative and it occasionally undergoes a relatively close encounter with the outer planet(s ) . after the encounter , the planet enters new kozai state with a changed @xmath25 . in the case of figure",
    "[ fig : nonlong ] , the planet enters kozai state at @xmath171 years first .",
    "this kozai cycle is terminated by a relatively close encounter with an outer planet before eccentricity is fully increased .",
    "the next kozai state starts at @xmath172 years , but @xmath25 of this cycle is not small enough to raise @xmath21 to @xmath173 ( @xmath2 au ) .",
    "the third kozai state starting at @xmath174 years is not clean kozai state because an outer planet is relatively close .",
    "however , thanks to the small value of @xmath25 , @xmath21 can be @xmath175 ( @xmath90 au ) in the cycle . if the tidal damping is included , the orbit would be circularized .",
    "eventually , at @xmath176 years , one of the outer planets is ejected and the system enters a stable state where the inner planet and the remaining outer planet are separated by 70 au . at the point",
    "when the system enters the stable state , @xmath177 au .",
    "however , since the inner planet is again in kozai state with relatively small @xmath25 , the pericenter periodically approaches 0.04 au , where the tidal dissipation is marginally effective in a relatively strong tide model .",
    "since the outer planet is separated by 70 au , the period of kozai cycle is more than @xmath124 years .",
    "marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) noticed this long term orbital change after the stabilization that can bring the pericenter to the vicinity of the stellar surface , although they did not refer to kozai mechanism .",
    "but , with their criterion , the third kozai cycle in which @xmath9 takes the smallest value in this run is missed . during three - planet orbit crossings , there are many chances to be in kozai state . and the kozai state is quasi - stable and it often has enough time for the pericenter to stay close to the star and be tidally circularized .",
    "since we monitored @xmath9 also during the three - planet orbit crossing ( in the models with tidal circularization effect , it is automatically monitored ) , we found much more cases to form close - in planets than previous authors did .",
    "figure [ fig : oscie ] gives another example . in this example , dynamical tide is included .",
    "after the chaotic phase ends , three planets enter a quasi - stable state .",
    "the eccentricity of innermost planet oscillates with large amplitude exchanging @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the longer period perturbation gradually enhances the mean eccentricity , and the planet s orbit is circularized at @xmath178 years .",
    "this is a similar example that marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) found .",
    "the close - in planet can be formed even if it is not injected into a good kozai condition at once as long as the planetary interaction continues .",
    "in previous section , we have showed that the kozai mechanism coupled with tidal circularization effectively sends planets to short - period orbits . in this section , we will present analytical arguments on kozai mechanism to evaluate the probability of forming close - in planets , to explain the numerical results .    in figure [",
    "fig : hamap ] , contours of @xmath179 given by equation ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) ( `` hamiltonian map '' ) is plotted on the @xmath180 plane , where @xmath181 .",
    "the topology of the hamiltonian map depends only on @xmath25 .",
    "the upper and lower panels are the maps with @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "when a planet is scattered into an orbit having some @xmath184 , the planet s orbit moves along the constant @xmath179 line that is determined by @xmath25 , provided the other planets are well separated and perturbations from them are secular .",
    "the argument of pericenter ( @xmath99 ) liberates when @xmath185 and @xmath186 . with other sets of @xmath187 , @xmath99 circulates .",
    "the range of @xmath179 and @xmath188 that the planet can actually has is determined by conditions of @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 . in figure",
    "[ fig : chrange ] , we plot the allowed range of @xmath179 and @xmath25 . at the libration center , @xmath179 takes the minimum value of @xmath192 .",
    "corresponding eccentricity is @xmath193 .",
    "as the figure shows , the attainable maximum eccentricity ( @xmath194 ) is higher for a lower @xmath25 value .",
    "the maximum eccentricity achieved at @xmath195 is @xmath196 for @xmath194 closer to unity , the minimum pericenter distance during kozai cycle is smaller . if it is small enough , tidal circularization is efficient and formation of close - in planet is expected . in figure",
    "[ fig : chrange ] , contours of @xmath194 for values close to unity are plotted on the @xmath179-@xmath188 plane . since @xmath188 is proportional to angular momentum @xmath92 , this plane is essentially the energy - angular momentum plane . assuming that @xmath179 and @xmath188 is distributed homogeneously after scattering , though this assumption may not be exactly true , the probability ( @xmath197 ) that a planet enters regions of @xmath198 is 46.8% , 30.8% , and 22.1% for @xmath199 and 0.99 , respectively .    in our simulation",
    "in which an initially innermost planet is at 5 au , a typical final semi - major axis of innermost planet is @xmath200 au ( figure [ fig : nonea ] ) . with the tidal circularization models we adopted ,",
    "the circularization is effective on timescales @xmath201 years if pericenter distance is smaller than @xmath2020.03 au .",
    "then @xmath2030.993 is required for the circularization . from the probability @xmath197 estimated above , we expect that formation probability of close - in planets is 2030% for this setting , which is consistent with our numerical results .",
    "realistic distribution of @xmath179 and @xmath188 might be more concentrated in lower @xmath179 and/or higher @xmath188 . in this case",
    ", @xmath197 may be smaller for one scattering , but the repeated nature of kozai mechanism may compensate for the decrease in @xmath197 to have the formation probability of close - in planets be a similar level .",
    "our numerical simulations in  [ sec : numerical ] were done for only one initial setting of the planetary semi - major axis .",
    "but the above estimates suggest the formation probability of the close - in planets may be similar in other settings .",
    "`` standard '' model for formation of close - in giant planets is that gas giants may be originally formed at several au s beyond ice lines and migrate to the vicinity of the star .",
    "the most referred migration mechanism is type ii migration . here",
    ", we have investigated another channel to move planets to the stellar vicinity , `` scattering '' model ( rasio & ford 1996 ) , which is a coupled process of planet - planet scattering and tidal circularization . if orbital eccentricity is pumped up to values close to unity , because of the proximity of the pericenter the eccentricity and the semimajor axis of the planet are damped by the tidal effect from the star , almost keeping the pericenter distance to form a close - in planet with relatively small eccentricity .",
    "we newly found that kozai mechanism is also one of key processes in the model .",
    "we have carried out orbital integration of three planets of jupiter - mass , including the tidal damping in the integration .",
    "we follow the simulation setup by marzari and weidenschilling ( 2002 ) .",
    "we found that in @xmath1530% runs , close - in planets are formed , which is much higher probability than suggested by previous studies ( weidenschilling and marzari 1997 ; marzari and weidenschilling 2002 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2007 ) , because in many cases , the circularization occurs during three - planet scattering , which was not monitored by previous studies .",
    "the three - planet scattering is usually terminated by ejection of one planet and the system enters a stable state .",
    "previous studies were concerned only with the stable state .",
    "since the tidal damping timescale is usually longer than that of orbital change in the chaotic stage of three - planet interaction , the tidal circularization does not occur during the chaotic stage , even if the pericenter distance happens to be small enough .",
    "but , we have found that when one planet is scattered inward , it often becomes separated from other outer planets .",
    "as long as the tidal dissipation is negligible , the isolation is only tentative , but its duration is long enough for the tidal circularization if the pericenter distance is small enough ( @xmath2040.04 au for jupiter - mass planets ) .",
    "we also found out that the isolated planet usually enters kozai state .",
    "even if the eccentricity of the planet is not excited enough by the close scattering that injected the planet to an inner orbit , the eccentricity can secularly increase to values close to unity during kozai cycle , in particular , when the planet has an inclined orbit .",
    "although the probability that the eccentricity takes values between 0.98 and 1.0 is quite low just after the scattering , that probability is significantly enhanced to 30% level during the kozai cycle .",
    "even if the kozai cycle has relatively large angular momentum and the eccentricity does not take such high value , the outer planets eventually destroy the quasi - stable state and have the inner planet enter another quasi - stable state , in other words , another kozai state .",
    "the new kozai state can have relatively small angular momentum and raise the eccentricity high enough for the tidal circularization .",
    "the repeated kozai mechanism enhances the probability for the tidal circularization to occur .",
    "thereby , we have found much higher probability of formation of close - in planets than previously expected .",
    "therefore , the scattering would contribute to formation of close - in planets , although a main channel may still be through type ii migration .",
    "non - negligible number of close - in planets without nearby secondary planets but with eccentricities @xmath6 has been discovered .",
    "it is not easy for type ii migration model to account for the high eccentricities , but the scattering model could account for them . as shown in sections 3.3 and 3.4 , the tidal circularization can slow down by increase in @xmath9 before full circularization , leaving moderate eccentricities .",
    "the discovered close - in eccentric planets are generally massive ( having masses larger than jupiter - mass ) among the close - in planets ( figure [ fig : exso]a ) , so their circularization timescales are much shorter than those shown in figure [ fig : timescale ] .",
    "therefore , the results in our sets t could be consistent with these discovered planets .    our results also suggest that the close - in planets have a broadly spread inclination distribution , including retrograde rotation",
    ". more observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect for the transiting close - in planets , in particular for those with relatively high eccentricity such as hd17156b , will impose constraints on the contribution of the scattering model to close - in planets .",
    "the tidally dissipated energy is @xmath205 in total , where @xmath0 is final semi - major axis of the circularized close - in planet and @xmath16 is its planet mass . since this energy is much larger than binding energy of the planet , it could be heat source for inflated close - in planets such as hd209458b , ogle - tr-10 , ogle - tr-56 , hat - p-1b or wasp-1b , if the tidal circularization occurred relatively recently ( orbital crossing followed by the circularization can start after long time after the formation of giant planets ) .",
    "note that the tidal circularization model we used may not be sufficiently relevant .",
    "we did many assumptions for the usage of equations ( [ eq : ang ] ) and ( [ eq : eng ] ) .",
    "the model is only valid for fully convective planets in highly eccentric orbits , since it consider only @xmath75 f - mode and use impulse approximation .",
    "we apply the model even after the orbits are significantly circularized , which may overestimate effect of tidal dissipation . in the multiple encounters to the star ,",
    "the energy and angular momentum can either increase or decrease ( e.g. , press & teukolsky 1997 ; mardling 1995a , 1995b ) , but we include the tidal effect as it always gives decreasing effect . because of these simplifications , our simulation may be a limiting case that the tidal force works most effectively , although inclusion of g - modes might strengthen the tidal effect .",
    "our purpose of this paper is not a study of the detailed tidal damping process but to show another available channel to the close - in planets .",
    "we also need to take into account the relativity precession and j2 potential of the central star which prevent the kozai mechanism , as well as long - term tidal disruption process ( e.g. , gu , lin , & bodenheimer 2003 ) . these issues are left for further studies .",
