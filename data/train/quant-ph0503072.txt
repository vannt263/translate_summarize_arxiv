    "the control of quantum phenomena is a topic that has been ( and is still ) a source of many interesting challenges not only to physics and chemistry but also to the mathematics and applied mathematics communities ( @xcite ) . at the level of the experiments , laser control of complex molecular systems is becoming feasible , especially since the introduction ( @xcite ) of closed loop laboratory learning techniques and their successful implementation ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , at the level of the numerical simulations , the introduction of the monotonically convergent algorithms by zhu & rabitz ( @xcite ) that extend an algorithm due to krotov ( @xcite ) has allowed a considerable progress and made possible further investigations in this area . recently ,",
    "a general class of monotonically convergent algorithms has been proposed ( @xcite ) and a relevant time discretization has been developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ however , no general analysis to explain in depth the convergence of these algorithms is available to date . in an attempt to fill this gap",
    ", this paper presents some results on the set of the controls provided by monotonic algorithms .",
    "+ note that , among others , this question was raised in @xcite , but a wrong statement about the cauchy character of the sequence is made that makes the proof not working as stated ; the proof is more involved as explained in what follows .",
    "+ the balance of the paper is as follows : the necessary background and definitions of the quantum control settings are given in section ii , properties of the monotonic sequences are presented in section iii , followed by the properties of the limit set in section iv .",
    "further results in a particular case are given in section v and concluding remarks are presented in section vi .",
    "consider a quantum system prepared in an initial state @xmath0 and whose dynamics is characterized by its internal hamiltonian @xmath1 . by assumption",
    "this hamiltonian does not give rise to an appropriate evolution and an external interaction is introduced in order to obtain the desired final property .",
    "this interaction is taken here as an electric field with time - dependent amplitude @xmath2 that influences the system through a time - independent dipole moment operator @xmath3 .",
    "the new hamiltonian @xmath4 gives rise to the equations ( we work in atomic units i.e. @xmath5 ) :    @xmath6    where we denote by @xmath7 the relevant spatial coordinates .",
    "these equations hold on @xmath8 but for numerical tests we will consider that @xmath7 belongs to an interval @xmath9 $ ] and that @xmath10 , for a large enough real number @xmath11 and any @xmath12 in @xmath13 .",
    "this approach is justified by physical reasons since wave functions are generally localized in a space interval .",
    "the optimal control framework is then used to find a suitable evolution of @xmath2 .",
    "the goal that the final state @xmath14 has prescribed properties is expressed by the introduction of a cost functional @xmath15 to be maximized .",
    "this cost functional also includes a contribution that penalizes undesirable effects .",
    "one simple example of such a cost functional is :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a parameter ( it may also depend on time cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath18 is an observable operator that encodes the goal : the larger the value @xmath19 is , the better the control objectives are met ( here and in what follows we use the convention that for any functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 and any operator @xmath22 : @xmath23 . note that , in general , achieving the maximal possible value of @xmath24 is at the price of a large laser influence @xmath25 ; the optimum evolution will therefore strike a balance between using a low laser fluence while simultaneously maximizing the desired observable .    at the maximum of the cost functional @xmath26 ,",
    "the euler - lagrange critical point equations are satisfied ; a standard way to write these equations is to use a lagrange multiplier @xmath27 called _ adjoint state_. the following critical point equations are thus obtained ( @xcite ) : @xmath28 from now on , @xmath29 and @xmath30 will represent two functions of the hilbert space @xmath31 for almost all @xmath12 in @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "efficient strategies for solving in practice the critical point equations ( [ el1])-([el4 ] ) are represented by the monotonically convergent algorithms ( @xcite ) that are guaranteed to improve the cost functional @xmath15 at each iteration . in the formulation proposed in @xcite ,",
    "the monotonic algorithms are described by the resolution of the following equations at step @xmath33 :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two real parameters .",
    "the most important property of this algorithm is given in the following theorem ( @xcite ) : +    suppose @xmath18 is a self - adjoint positive semi - definite operator .",

    "+      from theorem [ borne ] , one deduces that @xmath113 , where @xmath56 is defined in ( [ defm ] ) and @xmath114 stands for the ball of radius @xmath56 of @xmath46;\\mathbb{r})$ ] . according to the definition of @xmath110 , the results of the latest section prove that @xmath110 is a subset of the set of critical points of @xmath15 .",
    "finally , thanks to the monotonic property ( [ monoprop ] ) of the sequence @xmath41 , we deduce that @xmath15 is constant on @xmath110 .",
