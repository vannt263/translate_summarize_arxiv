    "the flux @xmath1 of protons hitting the atmosphere is steeply falling with energy , approximately @xmath2 .",
    "this translates into a muon momentum spectrum at the surface of the earth falling roughly as @xmath3 . on a flat surface the distribution of the zenith angle",
    "@xmath4 is to @xmath5-order proportional to @xmath6 , the exact shape depends on the muon momentum .",
    "the cosmic muon generator cmscgen @xcite was adapted from the fast l3cgen @xcite program which has been written for the l3 cosmics project @xcite some 10 years ago .",
    "these programs are based on a parametrization of the cosmic muon flux as a function of momentum and zenith angle .",
    "several developments of the last years suggest to take a fresh look at this parametrization of the muon flux @xcite :    * l3cgen was successfully used in l3 @xcite , and since 2006 cmscgen has been used@xcite .",
    "therefore a precise parametrization with known uncertainties is important , now and in future cosmic ray tests .",
    "this is in particular relevant for collider detectors , for example at the lhc . *",
    "the air shower program corsika @xcite , which allows the use of several interaction models , has evolved a lot , in particular it is now possible to simulate showers with large zenith angles , while the old version was limited to muons with an angle of at least @xmath7 with respect to the horizon .",
    "* the nuclear interaction models available through corsika have been improved in many ways , and there is a brand - new one , epos @xcite , which is based on recent rhic data . * precise muon flux measurements @xcite were made and can be compared to the simulated flux to assess the precision of our parametrization .",
    "we study the muon flux for momenta from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at the surface of the lhc ring , for all zenith angles .",
    "this note presents and discusses the parametrization obtained with the corsika version 6.60 @xcite .    in the following we first describe the mathematical form of the muon flux parametrization and give the values obtained from a corsika simulation for primary protons interacting with the atmosphere , using the default interaction models .",
    "then we compare the results to experimental data and to simulations based on other interaction models and to the parametrization of 1998 @xcite .",
    "finally we discuss the ratio of the flux for positive and negative muons and the influence of heavier primary nuclei on the momentum spectrum of the muons .",
    "we follow closely the procedure outlined in @xcite : the total muon flux , integrated over the full range of zenith angles ( vertical to horizontal ) and all azimuthal angles , at an altitude of about @xmath10 is parametrized in the form @xmath11 @xmath1 denotes the number of muons per time and area hitting a ( horizontal ) surface area , @xmath12 is the muon momentum and @xmath13 . the flux normalization constant @xmath14 will be discussed later . with this parametrization of the steeply falling muon momentum spectrum",
    "the function @xmath15 ( which we need to determine ) varies rather little with @xmath16 .",
    "the definition ( [ integrated_flux ] ) implies that @xmath15 can be written as @xmath17 this distribution can be obtained from the histogram of the logarithm @xmath16 , by applying a weight of @xmath18 to each muon generated by corsika . since the cosmic muon flux falls roughly with @xmath3 , the expression @xmath15 is a slowly varying function of @xmath16 , and we can approximate it by a polynomial : @xmath19 it turns out that a polynomial of degree six is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the distribution of the azimuthal angle @xmath20 is assumed to be flat , the dependence on the momentum dependent zenith angle ( here : @xmath21 for a vertically downgoing muon ) is parametrized by the normalized function @xmath22 with @xmath23 : @xmath24 we use spherical coordinates with the @xmath25 axis pointing vertically upwards ; thus vertical muons correspond to @xmath26 , horizontal ones to @xmath27 ; these numbers define the range of @xmath28 values to be considered .",
    "note that the three coefficients @xmath29 are not independent from each other since the integral @xmath30 is one by definition .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 depend on the muon momentum  we will discuss this later together with the monte carlo data .",
    "the global constant @xmath14 can be derived by comparing the predicted muon flux with the measured one , for vertical muons at the reference momentum of @xmath31 , see below .",
    "thus the full parametrization has the following simple form : @xmath32",
    "the primary particles impinging on the atmosphere are assumed to be protons with an energy distribution @xmath33 .",
    "we use corsika @xcite with the model epos ( version 1.61 ) @xcite for high enery interactions ( lab energy of 80 gev or more ) and gheisha ( version 2002d ) @xcite for low energy hadronic interactions .",
    "the standard atmosphere is used , zenith angles @xmath4 with @xmath34 are generated ( corresponding to showers @xmath35 above the horizon ) . in the following we limit the @xmath36 range to the interval",
    "@xmath37 $ ] .    we have generated five samples of 1 million showers each , for different primary energy ranges , covering in total all proton energies from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "lower or higher values hardly contribute to the muon momenta we are investigating here @xcite .    figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the the function @xmath15 as simulated for the total muon flux , together with the fitted polynomial @xmath40 note that we can normalize the coefficients of @xmath15 arbitrarily ; here we have done it such that the modulus of the first coefficient is one .",
    "the fit reproduces the simulated points with an accuracy of the order of @xmath41 , in the momentum range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 . at the lowest @xmath16-bins the fit degrades somewhat ( hardly visible in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , but the deviations reach up to @xmath44 )",
    "- we will come back to this later .",
    "the @xmath36 distribution @xmath45 is shown for two momentum ranges ( near @xmath46 and around @xmath47 ) in figure  [ fig : theta ] , for @xmath48 .    again",
    "the corsika points are approximated quite accurately by the parametrization .",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : theta ] that the momentum dependence of the zenith angle distribution must be taken into account .",
    "note that for an isotropic muon flux we would expect @xmath49 , due to the _ flat _ surface we consider here ( and not a spherical one ) .",
    "the @xmath16 dependence of the coefficients in ( [ costheta ] ) can again be parametrized by a polynomial .",
    "we obtain : @xmath50 technical remarks : please note that with these fitted curves the normalization requirement @xmath51 is respected only approximately ; consequently the @xmath29 as given above must be renormalized as a function of @xmath16 before @xmath22 can be calculated .",
    "also , for near horizontal showers and small momenta the flux becomes very small and the parametrization can result in negative values ; this region in @xmath52 should be cut away .",
    "the flux measurements of the last century are summarized in the compilation @xcite .",
    "the most precise results have been obtained by the l3 collaboration @xcite in 2004 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : data_spectrum ] we compare the measured _ vertical _ flux to our parametrization of @xmath53 , which we have obtained in a similar way as @xmath15 ( equation [ s - result ] ) but selecting only ( near-)vertical muons looks similar to @xmath15 as shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] , but the peak is shifted slightly to the left . ] .",
    "we show the ratio instead of the flux itself in order to be more sensitive to potential deviations in the distributions .",
    "note : since we have not yet introduced an absolute normalization , we have arbitrarily set the ratio to 1 near @xmath54 .",
    "since the compilation @xcite refers to the flux at altitude 0 ( sea level ) , we applied the small correction as given in formula ( 1 ) in @xcite to extrapolate to the altitude of @xmath10 .",
    "since the l3 flux is measured at a similar altitude , @xmath55 , no correction is necessary .",
    "the agreement between parametrization and measurements is remarkably good  only at momenta above @xmath56 deviations become visible .",
    "the measured and parametrized @xmath57 distributions are compared in figure [ fig : data_theta ] .",
    "note that the l3 points have been normalized ` by eye ' to the parametrization .",
    "the overall agreement is good , just for ( near-)vertical muons ( @xmath58 ) the line is a couple of percent too high for low momenta .",
    "finally we compare our parametrization as obtained with epos and gheisha to the predictions by other models .",
    "first we exchange gheisha against the other low energy hadronic interaction model available in corsika , fluka ( version 2006.3b ) @xcite , and we keep epos . in a second simulation run",
    "we keep gheisha , but exchange epos against qgsjet ( version ii-03 ) @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : spectrum_corsika ] in terms of the ratio of the fluxes ( zenith angle integrated ) predicted by the different models .",
    "again , we have arbitrarily normalized the ratio to 1 near @xmath54 .",
    "differences are clearly visible .",
    "the two alternative models introduced here differ from each other by up to @xmath59 in the momentum range @xmath0 .",
    "thus the models are not yet good enough to predict the flux with the same precision as obtained in the recent measurements .",
    "our reference model , epos+gheisha , lies in between the other two models .",
    "since the experimental data are in agreement with the reference model for momenta between @xmath60 and @xmath56 , these differences are only relevant at low and high momenta .",
    "the discrepancies here indicate the uncertainties intrinsic in these models .",
    "how does our new parametrization in equation ( [ s - result ] ) compare to the old one from 1998 @xcite  ?",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum_old ] shows the ratio of the fluxes , integrated over @xmath61 , the zenith angle range used in the old parametrization .",
    "the differences are quite large , the new momentum spectrum is significantly harder . actually , looking at figures [ fig : spectrum_corsika ] and [ fig : spectrum_old ] , there seems to be a general trend : the newer models ( epos and fluka ) give more muons with relatively high momenta    clearly",
    ", the discrepancies between the old and new parametrization make an update of cmscgen mandatory .",
    "figure [ fig : theta_old ] compares the parametrizations for the @xmath36 distribution .",
    "shown is the angular range and the momentum values as displayed in the original note @xcite .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory ; the small difference in shape can be attributed to the fact that before a linear approximation was used , while we now use a quadratic polynomial .",
    "for muons of momentum @xmath62 the vertical flux has been measured to @xcite @xmath63 and @xcite @xmath64 combining the two results leads to a flux of vertical muons with the following value , dominated by the l3 measurement : @xmath65    to calculate @xmath14 we first compute the product @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath26 using our parametrizations ( [ s - result ] ) and ( [ z - result ] ) : @xmath68 \\left [ -0.1653 - 2.7882 \\cdot ( -1 ) - 0.6948 \\cdot ( -1)^2 \\right ] \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 \\pi } = 2.177   \\cdot 10^{-6 } \\ , \\mathrm{gev}^{-3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to compensate for the small discrepancy at @xmath26 between l3 data and the parametrization of @xmath45 , which occurs at @xmath69 , see figure [ fig : theta ] and figure [ fig : data_theta ] , but also  to a lesser extent  at @xmath70 , we introduce a ` fudge factor ' of 1.05 to optimize the overall agreement of the parametrization with the l3 results : @xmath71 comparing with ( [ eq : flux ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) gives : @xmath72",
    "the measurements yield a ratio @xmath73 of positive and negative muon fluxes of @xcite @xmath74 and @xcite @xmath75 resulting in a combined value of @xmath76 for vertical incidence and momenta around @xmath70 .",
    "the data are consistent with a charge ratio @xmath73 which is independent of momentum ( at least from @xmath60 to @xmath56 ) and also of zenith angle , if one stays away from near horizontal muons @xcite .",
    "the corsika simulations ( epos+gheisha ) yield r values varying by @xmath77 around 1.40 for momenta in the range @xmath60 to @xmath78 , in disagreement with the measurements",
    ".    for the generator cmscgen the experimental result of @xmath79 must be used , i.e. the total muon flux must be split into positive and negative muons with the relative fractions of @xmath80",
    "it was already shown in @xcite that primary helium or iron nuclei yield muon spectra that are similar to those from protons . since anyway",
    "the parametrization presented here describes the experimental data well , there was no need to repeat such a study here .",
    "our parametrizations for @xmath45 can be used from @xmath81 ( vertically downward going muons ) to @xmath82 . for higher values ( nearly horizontal showers ) the jura mountains introduce a @xmath20 dependent absorption of muons , since they stand up about @xmath83 above the horizon , seen e.g. from the cms@xcite site .    for momenta below @xmath84 and above @xmath85 our parametrization is not valid and should therefore * not * be used .",
    "reasons are the instability of the fit for low and high momenta ( see figures [ fig : spectrum_corsika ] and [ fig : spectrum_old ] ) and the lack of reliable experimental data in these regimes ( see figure [ fig : data_spectrum ] ) .    in the ` central ' momentum range from @xmath60",
    "to @xmath56 our parametrization seems to work quite well : the measured cosmic fluxes are reproduced at the @xmath86 level .",
    "so we assign an uncertainty ( @xmath87 confidence level ) to the absolute differential flux as given by our parametrization of @xmath88 .    in the ` fringe ' momentum regions ( below @xmath89 and above @xmath56 ) the uncertainty increases rapidly .",
    "due to the missing experimental support at high momenta we assign a relative uncertainty to the flux increasing up to @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "this estimate is obtained by extrapolating the uncertainties displayed in figure [ fig : data_spectrum ] . at low momenta geomagnetic effects become important @xcite and atmospheric and solar influences make the muon flux vary with time @xcite , there is no comparison to experiment either , and the model predictions disagree with each other , see above .",
    "therefore we attribute to the low momentum regime a relative uncertainty increasing from @xmath92 at @xmath89 up to @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
