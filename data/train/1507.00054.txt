    "entanglement is a central topic in quantum information theory .",
    "it is viewed as a resource for manipulating quantum information and accomplishing quantum computing tasks . in an isolated pure state",
    "@xmath0 , entanglement is manifested as quantum correlations between its partitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the results of measurements done on a partition , say @xmath1 , are statistically distributed according to the reduced density operator @xmath3 , where the partial trace @xmath4 is a quantum average done over a complete set of states for the complementary partition @xmath2 . for these bipartite pure states ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 have identical spectra ( eigenvalues ) and hence entanglement measures can be calculated from either reduced density operator .",
    "when the partitions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are _ unentangled _ both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are projectors onto a single state vector . on the other hand , when @xmath1 and @xmath2 are _ maximally entangled _",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to uniform distributions over their respective eigenvectors .",
    "that is , there is more entanglement in @xmath7 when there is less certainty in the state of a given partition when the effects of its complement are averaged over .",
    "a similar relationship between the uncertainty in knowing the ( reduced ) state of a subsystem and the strength of its coupling with its complement or environment is well - established in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the main pedagogical objective in this article is the presentation of several key concepts of quantum information theory using the language of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "the construction of effective thermal models for a partition is a very useful concept that underlies more advanced ideas such as the emergence of area laws in the scaling of entanglement entropy @xcite and the replica trick of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the systems under consideration here are also particularly illustrative : for example , uncertainty and fluctuations in a mode - partitioned squeezed state are identical to that of a harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium .",
    "some of the results given in this paper have been demonstrated in the past @xcite , but here we emphasize the consonance of the quantum information and statistical mechanics perspectives .",
    "additionally , we also present some new exact results such as the detailed calculation of the rnyi entanglement entropy in bosonic two - mode squeezed states and a multi - mode silbey  harris state @xcite , and the identification of the single - copy entanglement @xcite as a free energy analogue @xcite for these systems . for a broader overview of the research on entanglement in many - particle systems",
    ", the reader may refer to extensive technical reviews found in the literature @xcite as well as others at a more introductory level @xcite .",
    "the mode - entangled examples studied here involve coherent ( displaced ) and squeezed boson modes that are encountered in , for example , quantum optical systems @xcite , ultracold coherent matter systems @xcite , and nanomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "we partition these composite states with respect to the mode indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 and analytically obtain the reduced density operator for a partition @xmath5 .",
    "this allows us to calculate entanglement measures ( ) for these bipartite pure states , such as the rnyi entanglement entropy @xcite and entanglement spectrum @xcite .",
    "the entanglement spectrum is further used to construct effective thermal models that yield identical fluctuations in observables that are local to a given partition ( mode - local ) .",
    "we first consider several cases of two - mode coherent and squeezed states ( ) and then proceed to the case of the multi - mode silbey  harris state ( ) .",
    "the reduced density operator @xmath5 is easily obtained when the composite state vector @xmath8 is normalized and expressed in schmidt decomposed form @xcite : @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a schmidt state vector with a subscript @xmath11 that labels the mode partition , @xmath12 is the corresponding schmidt coefficient , and @xmath13 is the schmidt number or schmidt rank of @xmath8 .",
    "the schmidt coefficients satisfy the normalization condition @xmath14 . for brevity",
    ", we will omit the mode indices for the state vectors @xmath15 and the tensor product operator @xmath16 when context is sufficient . evaluating the partial trace over mode @xmath2 then yields a diagonal representation for @xmath5 in the orthonormal basis of mode @xmath1 schmidt vectors : @xmath17 which is an operator of rank @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this reduced density operator are the complex squares of the schmidt coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "the state @xmath8 is separable ( unentangled ) with respect to the bipartition @xmath19 if and only if there is exactly one non - zero schmidt coefficient ( or , equivalently , the schmidt rank is @xmath20 ) .",
    "furthermore , if there is more than one non - zero schmidt coefficient ( @xmath21 ) then the state is entangled .",
    "for the special case in which @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , the state is maximally entangled .",
    "quantitative measures of entanglement in the bipartite pure state @xmath24 , such as the entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy , are discussed in more detail below .",
    "the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator @xmath5 constitute a probability distribution over the schmidt state projectors of the reduced system since @xmath25 .",
    "this set of eigenvalues is referred to as the entanglement spectrum @xcite and may be used to construct an effective thermodynamic ( canonical ) ensemble over the schmidt vectors of @xmath1 through @xmath26 this identification allows one to define an effective reciprocal temperature @xmath27 and a so - called entanglement hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that this is an effective thermodynamic analogy , since the composite pure state has no defined temperature ( it is isolated ) .",
    "however , such effective approaches have been used to investigate the mechanisms behind entanglement generation , area laws , and some critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "commonly used measures for entanglement between partitions are the von neumann and rnyi entanglement entropies , which quantify the degree of uncertainty associated with a density operator . when calculated for a reduced density operator ,",
    "the rnyi entropy is a scalar function of the entanglement spectrum @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the rnyi parameter .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath31 is the special case @xmath32 , which is mathematically identical to the gibbs entropy of statistical mechanics and the shannon entropy of classical information theory . other limiting values of the rnyi entropy",
    "include ( 1 ) the logarithm of the schmidt rank @xmath33 , ( 2 ) the rnyi-2 entropy @xmath34 , which is related to the purity @xmath35 @xcite , and ( 3 ) the single - copy entanglement @xmath36 ( sce ) , which quantifies the maximum amount of entanglement that can be distilled from one copy of a state using partition - local operations and classical communication @xcite .",
    "we now turn our attention to the calculation of the preceding entanglement measures for several mode entangled coherent and squeezed states .",
    "emphasis is made on the effective thermal theories for the reduced systems .",
    "a two - mode coherent state @xmath37 is obtained by applying a two - mode displacement operator @xmath38 on the two - mode vacuum state @xmath39 : @xmath40 where the superscript `` c '' on @xmath37 denotes `` coherent . ''",
    "the displacement operator can be written as a product of mode - local operators by the baker  campbell ",
    "hausdorff ( bch ) formula , which immediately gives the one - term schmidt decomposition @xmath41 where a single - mode coherent state is @xmath42 a similar one - term result is also obtained when an arbitrary number state is displaced , yielding a coherent number state @xmath43 .",
    "thus , a two - mode coherent state has zero mode entanglement entropy and , like the full composite system , each mode partition is in a pure state .",
    "this example illustrates an important property of bipartite entanglement : it is unchanged by the action of partition - local unitary operations @xcite .      a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath44 ( where the superscript `` s '' means `` squeezed '' ) is produced by applying the squeezing operator @xmath45 on the vacuum state @xmath39 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "this is a generalization of single - mode quadrature squeezing @xcite to the case of two boson modes @xcite .",
    "comparison with the defining formula reveals that the last equality is the schmidt decomposition for a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xmath44 .",
    "the entanglement spectrum @xmath48 therefore consists of the probabilities @xmath49 which are independent of the squeezing angle @xmath50 .",
    "the rnyi entropy is readily evaluated because the entanglement spectrum forms a geometric sequence : @xmath51 we find that the rnyi entropy increases monotonically with increasing squeezing magnitude @xmath52 , where for large squeezing magnitudes @xmath53 , it increases linearly with @xmath52 ( ) .",
    "thus , if the squeezing magnitude is tunable in an experimental realization of a two - mode squeezed state , then one can , in principle , generate arbitrarily large amounts of mode entanglement entropy .",
    "the rnyi entanglement entropy @xmath54 for a mode - partitioned two - mode squeezed vacuum state increases linearly with squeezing magnitude @xmath52 for large @xmath52 .",
    "the rnyi entropy is the same for displaced squeezed states and squeezed coherent states with identical squeezing parameters . ]",
    "taking the limit @xmath55 leads to the known result @xcite , which we now identify as the von neumann entropy : @xmath56 this result is valuable since the theoretical calculation of the total von neumann entropy in bipartite bosonic gaussian states reduces to the evaluation of @xmath57 for two - mode squeezed states @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the rnyi-2 entropy is @xmath58 so that the purity is @xmath59 .",
    "this expression for the rnyi-2 entropy is useful because it is an experimentally accessible quantity that is important for the measurement of entanglement in gaussian states via homodyne detections @xcite .",
    "moreover , the single - copy entanglement is @xmath60 .",
    "since the sce is a measure of the maximum entanglement that can be distilled from a given copy of a state , this exact result is relevant to experiments that carry out such distillations on squeezed states @xcite .",
    "let us now construct an effective thermal model for the reduced single - mode state .",
    "we equate the elements of the entanglement spectrum with a corresponding effective boltzmann weight @xmath61 we then define an effective reciprocal temperature @xmath27 through @xmath62 and obtain a harmonic oscillator entanglement hamiltonian @xmath63 with an energy shift so that the ground state energy @xmath64 ( we justify this shift in the following paragraph ) .",
    "in other words , the statistical properties of the reduced state is the same as that of a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath65 in thermal equilibrium ; the complementary mode @xmath2 interacts with @xmath1 as though it were in a thermal bath at an @xmath52-dependent reciprocal temperature @xmath27 and vice versa .",
    "since the ground state energy was chosen to be @xmath64 , the largest element of the entanglement spectrum in the effective thermodynamic picture is @xmath66 .",
    "thus , taking the limit @xmath67 to get the sce from the rnyi entropy gives @xmath68 hence , the evaluation of the single - copy entanglement allows one to calculate the partition function and free energy of the effective thermodynamic model . in the case of the two - mode squeezed vacuum state ,",
    "the effective free energy @xmath69 is @xmath70 which is identical to that of a harmonic oscillator at thermal equilibrium .",
    "we now investigate mode entanglement in states that are both displaced and squeezed .",
    "the two - mode displacement and squeezing operators generally do not commute and so we consider these cases separately .    a two - mode displaced squeezed vacuum state",
    "is denoted as @xmath71.\\ ] ] the two - mode displacement operator is a product of partition - local operators and has no effect on the entanglement entropy .",
    "the rnyi entropy of a displaced squeezed state is therefore the same as that of the original squeezed state prior to the application of the displacement operator : @xmath72    next we consider entanglement in a squeezed coherent state where the order of displacement and squeezing is interchanged from the preceding example : @xmath73.\\ ] ] using the bch formula to interchange the order of squeezing and displacement operators gives @xmath74 thus , a squeezed coherent state is also a displaced squeezed state with the same squeezing parameter and the rnyi mode entropy for @xmath75 also reduces to that of a squeezed state : @xmath76",
    "the multi - mode silbey  harris ( sh ) state is @xmath77,\\ ] ] which is a variational ansatz for a spin or qubit ( q ) coupled to an @xmath78-mode harmonic oscillator or boson bath ( b ) via an interaction of the form @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "this interaction leads to entanglement that can be measured and used to locate possible quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the variational parameters of the sh state are the components @xmath80 of the vector @xmath81 that give the displacements in an @xmath78-mode coherent state : @xmath82 \\ket{0}_1 \\ket{0}_2 \\cdots \\ket{0}_n \\equiv \\bigotimes_{k=1}^n \\ket{f_k}_k.\\ ] ] in this work , we choose the displacements @xmath80 to be real for simplicity",
    ". the single - mode coherent states @xmath83 and @xmath84 are not mutually orthogonal and so the sh state as written in is not schmidt decomposed with respect to the partitioning between the qubit and boson subspaces . however , calculation of the reduced density operator on the qubit space is straightforward with the knowledge of the matrix elements ( real @xmath85 ) @xmath86 and the fact that the trace of a tensor product of operators is equal to the product of the traces of each factor in the product . evaluating the partial trace of @xmath87 over the complete set of boson number basis states yields a qubit density matrix in the @xmath88 basis @xmath89 with the constant @xmath90 therefore , the entanglement spectrum for the mode - partitioned silbey ",
    "harris state is @xmath91 and the rnyi and von neumann entropies are @xmath92 , \\\\",

    "we find that mode entanglement in the sh state is exponentially sensitive to the displacements @xmath80 ( ): if any of the @xmath80 is significantly different from zero the entanglement entropy quickly saturates to its maximum value @xmath93 .",
    "the rnyi entanglement entropy @xmath54 for a silbey ",
    "harris state ( partitioned with respect to qubit and boson spaces ) depends on all the displacement amplitudes through @xmath94 .",
    "maximum entanglement is achieved exponentially fast with increasing @xmath94 . ]",
    "an effective entanglement hamiltonian for the reduced qubit state can be constructed such that it has a zero lower energy and an energy gap @xmath95 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the schmidt vector with the ( smaller ) eigenvalue @xmath98 .",
    "this entanglement hamiltonian leads to the effective canonical partition function for a two - level system @xmath99 defining the effective reciprocal temperature @xmath100 equates each element of the entanglement spectrum with a corresponding boltzmann weight of this effective thermal model . again , correspondence between the single - copy entanglement and @xmath101 for a two - level system with an energy gap @xmath95 follows immediately @xmath102 = \\ln ( 1 + { \\rme^{-\\beta\\delta } } ) = \\ln z.\\ ] ] the effective free energy @xmath103 is @xmath104   = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln \\left[\\frac{1}{1 + { \\rme^{-\\beta\\delta}}}\\right].\\ ] ]",
    "we have derived exact expressions for the rnyi entanglement entropy in bosonic two - mode squeezed states and the silbey ",
    "harris polaron ansatz for a qubit interacting with several boson modes .",
    "these exact results allowed us to ( 1 ) measure the entanglement present due to the interactions between the mode partitions , ( 2 ) construct effective canonical distributions with the same probability distributions as the reduced density operators , ( 3 ) express the effective reciprocal temperatures in terms of the physical variables such as the squeezing magnitudes and displacement parameters , and ( 4 ) identify the single - copy entanglement as the logarithm of an effective partition function .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that in a two - mode squeezed vacuum state characterized by the squeezing parameter @xmath105 , the rnyi entanglement entropy increases monotonically with @xmath106 .",
    "also , tracing out the effects of one boson mode leaves the other in a mixed state with identical statistical properties as that of a harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath65 at reciprocal temperature @xmath107 . increasing the squeezing magnitude increases entanglement and the effective temperature of the reduced subsystem .",
    "this mode entanglement is not affected by displacing either of the modes before or after squeezing .",
    "we further determined that entanglement between the qubit and a boson bath in a multi - mode silbey  harris state saturates exponentially to its maximum value of @xmath93 when any of the boson modes are significantly displaced . in terms of the displacement parameter @xmath81 ,",
