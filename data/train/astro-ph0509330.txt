    "currently most of the information on the universe comes from photons , however the detection of cosmic neutrinos would provide a new picture of distant regions of space .",
    "neutrinos travel in straight lines , undeflected by magnetic fields .",
    "they interact rarely , making detection challenging .",
    "however , if detected , the direction of an extraterrestrial neutrino would point to the particle s origin .",
    "many theoretical models predict that neutrinos originate in hadronic processes within high energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei and gamma - ray bursters .",
    "this analysis searches for neutrinos from unresolved sources .",
    "this search for a diffuse flux of extraterrestrial neutrinos assumes an e@xmath0 energy spectrum .",
    "although other models will be assumed in future work , this energy spectrum assumption is based on the theory of particle acceleration in strong shocks @xcite .",
    "protons experience first - order fermi acceleration and interact with protons and photons .",
    "the resulting pions are thought to decay into neutrinos that keep the same energy spectrum as the primary @xcite .",
    "the amanda - ii detector is a collection of 19 strings buried in the ice at the south pole @xcite .",
    "a total of 677 optical modules are attached to these strings between the depths of 1500 - 2000 m. each optical module consists of a photomultiplier tube surrounded by a pressure - resistant glass sphere .",
    "amanda - ii has been operating since 2000 .",
    "downgoing muons created when cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere trigger the amanda - ii detector at the rate of 80 hz .",
    "this saturates any possible extraterrestrial signal that might be seen from the southern hemisphere . hence ,",
    "upgoing events travelling from the northern hemisphere to the detector are selected for this analysis . in this way , the earth acts as a filter against cosmic ray muons @xcite .",
    "sky coverage is restricted to 2@xmath62 sr . however , above the pev range , the field of view is reduced due to neutrino absorption in the earth @xcite .",
    "muons , created from interacting muon neutrinos , travel long distances in the ice while emitting cherenkov light .",
    "the muon tracks are reconstructed from the detection times with a median space angle resolution of @xmath63 @xcite when events from the highest cut selection are used .",
    "all neutrino flavors can cause hadronic or electromagnetic cascades which appear as a spherical point source of light , however they will not be considered here .",
    "the analysis involved the simulation of several different classes of background events .",
    "monte carlo simulation of neutrinos in the ice was performed assuming an @xmath64 spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was reweighted to model an @xmath65 extraterrestrial neutrino signal with a @xmath66 test flux of @xmath6710@xmath68gev  cm@xmath0  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos were simulated by reweighting the neutrino events to a steeper @xmath71 spectrum .",
    "this spectral dependence is common to both atmospheric muons and neutrinos because they are both produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "sixty - three days of downgoing atmospheric muons were simulated with corsika @xcite .",
    "downgoing atmospheric muons can reach amanda depth , however they can not penetrate the earth from the other hemisphere .",
    "in contrast , atmospheric neutrinos from the northern hemisphere can reach the detector .",
    "hence , atmospheric muons can be rejected with directional cuts , but atmospheric neutrinos can not be distinguished from signal in this way . however , because the signal has a harder energy spectrum , both atmospheric muons and neutrinos can be separated from signal by energy - based cuts .",
    "it is also possible that two downgoing muons from independent cosmic ray interactions may occur in the detector within the same detector trigger window .",
    "if this occurs , the software will have to guess one incidence direction for the pattern of light produced by two different tracks .",
    "the resulting reconstructed direction may be upgoing .",
    "these events , known as coincident muons , were simulated for 826 days of livetime .",
    "the 2000 to 2003 search encompassed 807 days of detector livetime . as will be described below , the number of optical modules recording photons was used as an energy - related observable to distinguish extraterrestrial neutrinos from atmospheric backgrounds @xcite .",
    "analysis cuts were optimized by studying the signal and background monte carlo . in order to satisfy blindness requirements ,",
    "the monte carlo and data were checked for agreement with events triggering less than 80 optical modules ( nchannel @xmath72 ) , hence leaving the high energy data unbiased .",
    "the analysis began with 7.1@xmath73 data events which triggered the detector during this time .",
    "most of these were downgoing muons .",
    "all data events underwent an initial track reconstruction in which the software picked a direction of the particle based on the pattern of light the detector recorded .",
    "all events with reconstructed zenith angles between @xmath74 ( travelling straight down ) and @xmath75 degrees ( just above the horizon ) were removed .",
    "more computer - intensive track reconstructions were performed on the remaining events .",
    "although zenith angle cuts required the events to be upgoing , many downgoing atmospheric muons were misreconstructed as upgoing and remained in the sample . to separate these events from the expected atmospheric and extraterrestrial neutrino signals ,",
    "events were removed if they did not show the signature of a muon neutrino in the detector .",
    "long muon tracks smoothly emit cherenkov light .",
    "high quality events cause many hits that arrive close to the calculated time for unscattered photons .",
    "these hits must be spread evenly along the track and the log likelihood that the track is upgoing rather than downgoing must be high .",
    "as the requirements for these parameters were tightened , the number of data events began to look increasingly like the atmospheric and extraterrestrial signal monte carlo and less like the downgoing atmospheric muon simulation ( see figure  [ fig : counts ] ) .",
    "the quality cuts were optimized to reject the single and coincident muon backgrounds while preserving the expected signal .",
    "quality cut level 11 was chosen to define the sample used for analysis .",
    "after a zenith angle cut at @xmath75 degrees , 7,769,850 data events remained in the low - energy ( nchannel @xmath72 ) sample , but the event quality cuts reduced this to 2207 data events .",
    "the feldman - cousins method for calculating the average upper limit was applied @xcite .",
    "the model rejection factor is defined as the average upper limit divided by the number of predicted signal events @xcite for a @xmath66 signal test flux @xmath6710@xmath68gev  cm@xmath0  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 . using the simulation of signal and background ,",
    "the model rejection factor was calculated as a function of the number of optical modules hit in the detector .",
    "the minimum model rejection factor , which indicates the best placement of the nchannel cut to separate signal from background , occurs for nchannel @xmath76 ( see figure  [ fig : zenith ] ) . above this cut",
    ", the expected background of 16.2 atmospheric neutrinos leads to an average upper limit of 8.19 .",
    "dividing this by the expected signal for the given test flux ( 86.3 events ) leads to a final sensitivity on the @xmath66 flux of @xmath7710@xmath78gev  cm@xmath0  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 , or @xmath7910@xmath80gev",
    "cm@xmath0  s@xmath70  sr@xmath70 .",
    "the sensitivity ( multiplied by three for oscillations ) is shown in figure  [ fig : limits ] in relation to several other models and analyses .",
    "the signal monte carlo events that populate the final data set have true neutrino energies between 13 tev and 3.2 pev ( 90% region ) .",
    "with the cuts established and sensitivity determined , the high energy data can be studied .",
    "limits obtained from the analysis of the complete data set will be presented at the conference .",
    "the sensitivity of this four - year analysis is improved by a factor of nine over the limit previously set for one year of experimental data ( 1997 ) .",

    "neutrino - astrophysics has enlarged over the last years the knowledge of neutrinos and their properties .",
    "current experiments are able to measure the neutrino flux from the sun as well as the flux that is produced by cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere .",
    "the aim of high energy neutrino experiments such as amanda @xcite is to observe an extraterrestrial component of the neutrino spectrum .",
    "the amanda detector , located at the geographical south pole , uses the ice as the active volume .",
    "+ due to the high atmospheric neutrino flux at energies @xmath82  gev , a non - atmospheric component has not yet been observed .",
    "the atmospheric flux decreases roughly with @xmath83 as opposed to the extragalactic contribution , which is expected to be around 1.7 powers flatter , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , it is predicted that an additional contribution should become dominant at higher energies .",
    "the exact energy at which the extraterrestrial flux exceeds the prediction of the atmospheric one is not known due to the uncertainties in the source properties which would determine the normalization of the neutrino flux .",
    "+ the diffuse neutrino flux presented is measured with a combination of a neural network and a regularized unfolding @xcite as described in @xcite .",
    "since the measured neutrino flux corresponds with the expectation of the atmospheric neutrino flux up to an energy of 100  tev , the question of additional constituents and their exclusion has to be investigated .",
    "this paper describes how an upper limit to the neutrino flux from extraterrestrial sources can be obtained .",
    "it is shown how the unified approach of feldman & cousins can be applied to an unfolding problem to set a 90% confidence belt .",
    "taking into account the statistical behavior of individual events , the probability density functions are calculated using large mc statistics .",
    "finally , a limit on the diffuse muon neutrino and antineutrino flux from extragalactic sources is presented .",
    "this limit gives the most restrictive estimate of an upper bound of the neutrino flux among currently existing experiments .",
    "amanda is a large volume neutrino telescope with the capability to search for neutrinos from astrophysical sources @xcite . in a previous publication @xcite it was shown that neutrino telescopes are able to search for uhe neutrinos ( neutrinos with energy greater than 10@xmath112 gev ) .",
    "uhe neutrinos are of interest because they are associated with the potential acceleration of hadrons by agns @xcite , are produced by the decays of exotic objects such as topological defects @xcite or z - bursts @xcite and are guaranteed by - products of the interaction of high energy cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "above 10@xmath113 gev the earth is essentially opaque to neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this , combined with the limited overburden above amanda ( approximately 1.5 km ) , means that uhe neutrinos will be concentrated at the horizon .",
    "the background for this analysis consists of bundles of down - going , high energy muons from atmospheric showers .",
    "the muons from these bundles can spread over areas as large as 10@xmath114 m@xmath115 .",
    "separation of signal from the background takes advantage of the fact that signal events have a higher light density than background events , which causes multiple hits in multiple channels . using this as well as the differences in geometrical acceptance and hit topology it is possible to remove almost all background while retaining a high sensitivity to signal .",
    "a previous analysis was performed using the inner ten strings of amanda ( called amanda - b10 ) @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses all nineteen strings of amanda ( called amanda - ii , for description see @xcite ) .",
    "although the effective area of amanda - ii is approximately the same as amanda - b10 for this analysis , the larger number of optical modules ( oms ) offer improved background rejection leading to an improved sensitivity .",
    "one of the major goals of the large - scale neutrino detectors , amanda and icecube , is to identify cosmic sources of high - energy neutrinos ( @xmath106100gev ) .",
    "this search is performed by reconstructing the direction of neutrino - induced muons using the pattern of their cherenkov light emission .",
    "muons and neutrinos produced in the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere form the dominant background for this analysis .",
    "both types of particle are generated in the decay of charged mesons ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) , which originate in the inelastic scattering of cosmic ray primaries with nuclei of the atmosphere .",
    "the muons lose energy by electromagnetic interactions in the ice and rock surrounding the detectors and can therefore not penetrate more than a few kilometers into dense materials . consequently , this background can be readily removed by restricting the observation to particles travelling in upward direction in the ice .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos however reach the detectors from all directions and can not be distinguished from extra - terrestrial neutrinos .",
    "therefore they remain as a residual background in the data sample , and it is essential to study the properties of this background well to quantify correctly possible deficits and excesses that would be interpreted as neutrino sources .",
    "the search for variations of the atmospheric neutrino rate in time is an example for such a study .",
    "we report here on an investigation dedicated to seasonal variations in the atmospheric neutrino rate in the amanda - ii detector .",
    "annual temperature fluctuations of the atmosphere could be responsible for such variations .",
    "we perform a calculation of the expected magnitude of oscillation in the amanda - ii event rate caused by this effect .",
    "the results of these calculations are compared with atmospheric neutrino data from the amanda - ii neutrino telescope , recorded in 2000 - 2003 ( the data sample used for the point source analysis @xcite ) .",
    "detecting and characterizing astrophysical neutrinos in the 10@xmath154  ev to 10@xmath155  ev range is a central goal of astro - particle physics .",
    "the more optimistic flux models in this range involve discovery physics including topological defects and relic neutrinos . detecting the smaller flux of cosmogenic ( or greisen , zatsepin , and kusmin , `` gzk '' ) neutrinos produced via ultra - high energy cosmic ray interaction with the cosmic microwave background would test models of cosmic ray production and propagation and of particle physics at extreme energies .",
    "with @xmath156100 detected events , their angular distribution would give a measurement of the total neutrino - nucleon cross section at @xmath156100 tev center of mass , probing an energy scale well beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "hence , as a baseline , a detector capable of detecting @xmath15610 gzk events per year has promising basic physics potential . if any of the more exotic theories predicting greater eev neutrino fluxes is correct , the argument in favor of such a detector is even stronger .    to detect @xmath15610 gzk events per year ,",
    "a detector with an effective volume of @xmath156100  km@xmath157 at eev energies is necessary .",
    "in addition to the possibility of identifying neutrino - induced inclined air showers , there are three methods of ultra - high energy neutrino detection in solid media : optical , radio , and acoustic .",
    "optical cherenkov detection is a well - established technique that has detected atmospheric neutrinos up to 10@xmath158 ev and set limits up to 10@xmath159  ev @xcite .",
    "radio efforts have produced steadily improving upper limits on neutrino fluxes from 10@xmath154  ev to 10@xmath160  ev @xcite .",
    "acoustic detection efforts are at an earlier stage , with one limit published thus far from 10@xmath161 to 10@xmath160  ev @xcite .",
    "the currently planned 1  km@xmath157 optical neutrino telescopes expect a gzk event rate of @xmath1561 per year .",
    "it is possible to extend this by adding more optical strings for a modest additional cost @xcite , but it s difficult to imagine achieving 10 or more events per year with optical strings alone . the radio and acoustic methods have potentially large effective volumes with relatively few receivers , but the methods are unproven in that they have never detected a neutrino .",
    "indeed , if radio experiments claim detection of a gzk signal , it may be difficult to confirm that it is really a neutrino signal .",
    "however , it may be possible to bootstrap the large effective volumes of radio and acoustic detection with the optical method , by building a hybrid detector that can detect a large rate of radio or acoustic events , a fraction of which are also detected by an optical detector . a signal seen in coincidence between any two of the three methods",
    "would be convincing .",
    "the information from multiple methods can be combined for hybrid reconstruction , yielding improved angular and energy resolution .",
    "we simulated the sensitivity of a detector that could be constructed by expanding the icecube observatory currently under construction at the south pole .",
    "the ice at the south pole is likely well - suited for all three methods : its optical clarity has been established by the amanda experiment @xcite , and its radio clarity and suitability for radio detection in the gzk energy range has been established by the rice experiment @xcite .",
    "acoustically , the signal in ice is ten times greater than that in water .",
    "theoretical estimates indicate low attenuation and noise @xcite , and efforts are planned to measure both @xcite with sensitive transducers developed for glacial ice @xcite . here",

    "the neutrino energy spectrum is dominated by the background of atmospheric neutrinos . by means of mc studies of atmospheric neutrinos",
    "the number of events per energy interval can be estimated .",
    "the lower energy threshold of examined events for a potential neutrino signal can be optimized @xcite .",
    "this leads to a limit on the non - atmospheric neutrino flux using the number of measured events above the optimized threshold .",
