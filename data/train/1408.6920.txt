    "these results have been corroborated by the belle @xcite , cdf @xcite , d0 @xcite , and again lhcb @xcite collaborations .",
    "conversely , in @xcite , the @xmath9 into @xmath2 and @xmath10 is investigated , and a signal is seen for the @xmath3 production while only a very small fraction is observed for the @xmath4 production .",
    "estimations of the order of magnitude of rates for some of these reactions have been done using light cone qcd sum rules under the factorization assumption @xcite .",
    "also , the experimental data have served as a basis of discussion on the possible nature of the scalar mesons as a @xmath11 or tetraquark @xcite .",
    "more recently , a simple approach based on the final state interaction of mesons provided by the chiral unitary approach has been applied that allows us to calculate all these rates relative to one of them @xcite .",
    "the work isolates the dominant weak decay mechanism into @xmath2 and a @xmath11 pair .",
    "after this , the @xmath11 pair is hadronized , and meson - meson pairs are produced with a certain weight .",

    "this approach uses a full unitary scheme by means of the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels @xcite , extracting the kernel , or potential , from the chiral lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach to deal with meson - meson interaction and with reactions in which the @xmath3 or @xmath4 and other resonances are produced is remarkable ( see @xcite for a detailed list of reactions studied ) , but the closest ones are the @xmath12 where different signals for the @xmath3 , @xmath4 are observed depending on the reaction @xcite .",

    "the work exploits flavor symmetries and dynamics of meson - meson interaction and factorizes the matrix elements of the weak process , which are not explicitly evaluated .",

    "the advent of chiral unitary theory , the line followed in the present work , offered a new perspective where these light scalars were a consequence of chiral dynamics and unitarity in coupled channels : the chiral lagrangian provides a potential between pseudoscalar mesons , which used in the context of the bethe - salpeter equations in coupled channels , leads to poles in the scattering matrix which correspond to the physical states . since they are generated from the multiple scattering of the mesons via the bethe - salpeter equation , they are called dynamically generated states and would correspond to meson - meson molecular states in the ordinary classification .",
    "the discussion on this issue keeps going . in @xcite",
    "these mesons are considered as @xmath173 tetraquarks . in @xcite",
    "they are considered as a mixture of @xmath11 and tetraquarks , and the @xmath3 would have about 40% probability of @xmath11 and 60% of tetraquark .",
    "it is clear that the debate is not over . yet , in view of this , let us go back to the chiral unitary approach and reinterpret the previous results .",
    "we can see a link of the quark pictures with the chiral unitary approach by recalling the interesting observation made in @xcite that `` the properties obtained within these quark models should be interpreted as being bare properties , subject to a nontrivial renormalization due to effects which provide unitary corrections to the scattering amplitudes in which these particles appear as poles . ''",
    "these unitary corrections , incorporating meson - meson multiple scattering , are so huge that upon its implementation the width of the @xmath3 appears of the order of 500 mev , as seen in the work of @xcite . certainly , this effect of the meson - meson scattering adds necessarily meson - meson components to the wave function of the @xmath3 , that in terms of quarks could be interpreted as having largely a four - quark component , or a meson - meson component if we use a different basis to write the wave function .",
    "this effect was already discussed in @xcite , where starting from a seed of @xmath11 , its coupling to meson - meson components was considered and unitarization was implemented , concluding that the meson cloud took over the original seed of @xmath11 in the light scalar mesons . in the chiral unitary approach , one already makes a starting point from this position , implicitly assuming that these states are meson - meson composite states , but recalling that whatever model one wishes to do for the scalars , the explicit consideration of the meson - meson multiple scattering is unavoidable if one wishes to have an accurate description of experimental data .",
    "this said , the approach is rather flexible in the sense that , even with its strong predictive power , there is one parameter that one has to fit to experiment ( some scattering data usually ) , which is the regularization parameter in the meson - meson loop functions ( a cutoff , or a subtraction constant if dimensional regularization is used ) .",
    "it is well known that , in coupled channels , the effects of less important missing channels can be largely accounted for by a suitable change of the cutoff or subtraction constant @xcite . in this sense , the approach is flexible enough to account for possible @xmath11 components in the wave function which are not explicitly considered in the different meson - meson components of the wave function .",
    "it is from this perspective that one should view the success of the chiral unitary approach describing different reactions where the light scalars are produced , as briefly discussed in the introduction and in @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the suitability of different pictures to describe experimental phenomena should be the guiding principle into the discussion of the nature of the scalars .",
    "the present work brings a new step in this direction .",
    "steps in the same direction with different pictures would certainly be most welcome .    in the discussion about the nature of hadrons , in which the vector mesons stand as largely @xmath11 states",
    "while the low - lying scalar mesons are rather dynamically generated states from the meson - meson interaction , we have shown that the @xmath167 decays investigated here greatly support this picture .",
    "we studied together the two decay modes into the @xmath2 scalar and @xmath2 vector from this perspective , and we obtained a remarkable agreement with experimental results which range in several orders of magnitude .",
