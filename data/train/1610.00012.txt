    "like black holes , the big bang in the very early universe involves extreme conditions that neither relativity nor quantum theory can explain on its own .",
    "if we trace back the history of our universe , we will meet an initial singularity in which matter reached almost infinite density and then , according to the theory of general relativity , the space was contracted to a point and the time flow nearly stopped .",
    "thus the big bang suffers the initial singularity in which space and time cease to exist .",
    "this implies that the big bang must be a cosmological event generating space and time as well as matters .",
    "the initial singularity can not be avoided in the inflationary cosmology either because there has to be a definite beginning to an inflationary universe.@xcite this means that the inflation is incomplete to describe the very beginning of our universe and some new physics is needed to probe the past boundary of the inflating regions .",
    "one possibility is that there must have been some sort of quantum creation event as a beginning of the universe .",
    "the inflation scenario so far has been formulated in the context of effective field theory coupled to general relativity .",
    "hence , in this scenario , the existence of space and time is _ a priori _ assumed from the beginning and the scenario only describes what happens in a given spacetime . in other words , the inflationary scenario does not describe any generation ( or creation ) of spacetime but simply characterizes an expansion of a preexisting spacetime .",
    "it never addresses the ( dynamical ) origin of spacetime .",
    "moreover , in most inflationary models , once inflation happens , it never stops and produces not just one universe , but an infinite number of universes .",
    "therefore the conventional inflation inevitably leads to the multiverse which is not falsifiable since the multiverse can not be tested experimentally.@xcite    in consequence , we need a consistent quantum theory to describe how spacetime was generated through the big bang in order to correctly understand the origin of spacetime and our universe .",
    "in particular , we need a background - independent theory which does not assume the prior existence of spacetime background but instead provides a mechanism of spacetime generation such that any spacetime structure including flat spacetime arises as a solution of the theory itself .",
    "in other words , we need a background - independent formulation of cosmic inflation in which the inflation corresponds to the dynamical emergence of spacetime .",
    "recently such a background independent formulation was proposed @xcite so that the cosmic inflation arises as a time - dependent solution of the matrix quantum mechanics describing the dynamical process of planck energy condensate in vacuum without introducing any inflaton field as well as an _ ad hoc _ inflation potential .",
    "the underlying mathematical principle is the well - known duality between geometry and algebra . in this scheme ,",
    "the noncommutative ( nc ) algebra plays a more fundamental role from which the spacetime geometry is derived and the emergent gravity from nc @xmath0 gauge theory is basically the large @xmath1 duality , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fchart : lnd ] :     duality.@xcite , width=432 ]    since the concept of the multiverse raises deep conceptual issues even to require to change our view of science itself , it should be important to ponder on the real status of the multiverse whether it is simply a mirage developed from an incomplete physics like the ether in the late 19th century or it is of vital importance even in more complete theories . in next section",

    "it turns out @xcite that the global symmetry ( [ poincare - auto ] ) is responsible for the poincar symmetry of flat spacetime emergent from a vacuum in the coulomb branch of mqm and so will be called the poincar automorphism .",
    "we remark that the time @xmath11 in the action ( [ mqm ] ) is not a dynamical variable but a parameter .",
    "the concept of time has been introduced in ref . by considering a one - parameter family of deformations of zero - dimensional matrices which is parameterized by the coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "then the one - parameter family of deformations can be regarded as the time - evolution of a dynamical system .",
    "a close analogy with quantum mechanics implies that the concept of emergent time is connected with the time - evolution of the dynamical system . in this context , the one - dimensional matrix model ( [ mqm ] ) can be interpreted as a hamiltonian system of a zero - dimensional ( e.g. , ikkt ) matrix model.@xcite    the equations of motion for the matrix action ( [ mqm ] ) are given by @xmath12 = 0,\\ ] ] which must be supplemented with the gauss constraint @xmath13 = 0.\\ ] ] now we want to apply the large @xmath1 duality to mqm that is the @xmath14 case in fig .",

    "it is important to notice that there are two different kinds of vacua in the coulomb branch if we consider the @xmath15 limit .",

    "we emphasize that the nc coulomb branch ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) together with a constant vacuum energy density given by @xmath22 is a consistent _ vacuum _ solution of mqm since it satisfies the equations of motion @xmath23 as well as the gauss constraint ( [ gauss - mqm ] ) .",
    "since @xmath24 is proportional to the identity matrix , it plays no role in the temporal covariant derivative @xmath25 and so it can be dropped without loss of generality .",
    "also note that the coherent vacuum ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) saves the nc nature of matrices while the conventional vacuum dismisses the property .",
    "if we consider fluctuations around the nc vacuum ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) given by @xmath26 the action for the fluctuations is exactly mapped to a @xmath27-dimensional nc @xmath0 gauge theory as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fchart : lnd ] .",
    "if the conventional commutative vacuum were chosen , we would have failed to realize the higher - dimensional nc @xmath0 gauge theory from mqm .",
    "indeed it turns out @xcite that the nc coulomb branch is crucial to realize the emergent gravity from matrix models or large @xmath1 gauge theories as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fchart : lnd ] .",
    "furthermore the nc coulomb branch ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) is very different from the conventional commutative vacuum because the former carries a nonzero vacuum energy density in contrast to the latter for which the vacuum energy density identically vanishes .",
    "using the higher - dimensional nc @xmath0 gauge theory , we can calculate the energy density for the vacuum condensate in the nc coulomb branch defined by @xmath28 the result is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the @xmath27-dimensional gauge coupling constant .",

    "[ fchart : lnd ] says that the gravitational variables such as vielbeins in general relativity arise from the commutative limit of nc @xmath0 gauge fields via the map ( [ der - d ] ) .",
    "then one may ask where flat minkowski spacetime comes from .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the @xmath27-dimensional flat minkowski spacetime is emergent from the vacuum condensate ( [ nc - vacuum ] ) since the corresponding vielbeins and the metric are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a striking fact is that the flat minkowski spacetime is emergent from the moyal - heisenberg algebra ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) whose energy density is given by eq .",
    "( [ vacuum - density ] ) .",
    "thus the flat spacetime was originated from the uniform vacuum energy ( [ vacuum - density ] ) known as the cosmological constant in general relativity .",
    "this is a tangible difference from einstein gravity , in which the energy - momentum tensor identically vanishes , i.e. @xmath41 , for the flat spacetime .",
    "however , since we have started with the matrix model ( [ mqm ] ) in which any spacetime structure has not been assumed in advance , the spacetime was not existent at the beginning but simply emergent from the vacuum condensate ( [ nc - coulomb ] ) .",
