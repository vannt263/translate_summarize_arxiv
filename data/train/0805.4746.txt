    "about 15 per cent of optically - selected quasars exhibit broad absorption lines ( bals ) in the blue wings of the uv resonance lines , due to gas with outflow velocities up to 0.2 c @xcite .",
    "a classification of bals has been done according to their association with highly ionised species like civ , nv , siiv ( hibals ) or , in addition , with low - ionisation species like mgii or aliii ( lobals ) .",
    "these broad troughs are the most evident manifestations of quasar outflows but many other intrinsic absorbers such as associated absorption lines ( aals ) , mini - bals or high velocity narrow absorption lines ( nals ) are also related to them ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the study of bal quasars ( bal qsos ) has become increasingly important in the last years .",
    "outflows are not only useful as probes of the physics in the agn environment , but also because they might be an important piece in many other puzzles like enrichment of the intergalactic medium , galaxy formation , evolution of the agn and the host galaxy , cluster cooling flows , magnetisation of cluster and galactic gas and the luminosity function of quasars .    at the moment",
    "it is not clear how many quasars host outflows and why these can only be seen in a fraction of the quasar population .",
    "the most popular hypotheses proposed to explain this mainly differ in the role given to orientation .",
    "the main premise in the ` orientation scenario ' is that the bal phenomenon might be present in all quasars but intercepted by only @xmath115 per cent of the lines of sight to the quasar @xcite , e.g. within the walls of a bi - funnel centred on the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported because in most respects , apart from the bals themselves , bal qsos look similar to normal quasars .",
    "the small differences from non - bal qsos , e.g. slightly redder continua @xcite and higher optical polarisation , could be a consequence of a preferred orientation of viewing angle .",
    "the alternative hypothesis , the so - called ` unification by time ' , assumes that bals appear during one or maybe more short periods in the lifetime of quasars .",
    "the observed rate of bal qsos would then be a function of the percentage of the quasar lifetime in which these outflows show up .",
    "this evolutionary scenario has been discussed by @xcite on the basis of the radio properties of their faint images radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first , @xcite ) bal qso sample .",
    "they note that 80 per cent of their bal qsos are unresolved at a 0.2-arcsec scale , with both flat and steep spectra .",
    "this latter group resembles the compact steep - spectrum sources ( css ) and their gigahertz peaked - spectrum ( gps ) sub - class . as a consequence",
    ", they suggest the picture in which bal qsos represent an early stage in the development of quasars .",
    "this last scenario finds motivation on the collection of theoretical and phenomenological works that in recent years have contributed to build a first consistent picture of early agn evolution . as an example , recent simulations @xcite describe how quasar evolution can be understood as the result of merger events , where the super - massive black hole grows via accretion and , when it finally becomes an active ` protoquasar ' , expels out the surrounding material deposited by the merger through powerful winds .",
    "the fingerprints of these winds have been manifested not only as bal troughs in uv spectra , but also as emission line outflows and sometimes associated to hi absorptions ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . to that respect ,",
    "even if the fraction of optically - selected quasars hosting bal systems is estimated to be about 10 - 20 per cent of the quasar population , it has been argued that these samples might be substantially biased against bal qsos , as suggested by larger fractions of bal qsos found among infrared - selected quasars @xcite . in addition , @xcite have recently estimated that @xmath160 per cent of agns could host outflows when the different kinds of intrinsic absorptions are considered .",
    "radio emission has become , in fact , an important additional diagnostic tool when studying the orientation and evolutionary status of bal qsos . for a long time",
    "radio - loud bal qsos were believed to be extremely rare among the population of luminous quasars @xcite . with the advent of large comprehensive radio surveys",
    "it has however become clear that radio - loud bal qsos are common .",
    "however the fraction of bal qsos seem to vary inversely with the radio - loudness parameter , with the radio - brightest quasars being 4 times less likely to exhibit bals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the evolutionary picture is , in fact , supported by some recent works coming from radio observations .",
    "for instance , evn observations at 1.6 ghz of a few bal qsos from becker s list @xcite show that they present a still compact structure at these resolutions , with sub - kpc projected sizes , and a variety of orientations according to their radio geometry .",
    "in addition , the radio powerful css bal qso 1045 + 352 has also been observed with merlin and vlba , and its complex radio structure has been interpreted as evidence of radio - intermittent activity @xcite .",
    "some other works address the question of the orientation of bal qsos through radio variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they compare the 1.4-ghz flux densities of all quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalogues ( @xcite ; @xcite ) with detections in both the first and nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) surveys .",
    "the most strongly variable quasars have probably their jets closely aligned with the line of sight , being the relativistic beaming responsible for such high flux density variations . some of those variable quasars present in addition the bal phenomenon which is considered as a proof for the existence of at least a sub - population of polar bal qsos . at the same time",
    ", a few examples have been found of bal qsos associated to radio sources with an extended fr ii morphology @xcite which suggest for those the opposite edge - on orientation .",
    "this paper reports the first results of a study in which a systematic approach is taken to characterise the radio - loud bal qso population .",
    "the final goal is to locate these objects in the framework of an adequate orientation and/or evolutionary status scenario . in order to do this",
    ", the radio spectra and polarisation properties of a small sample of radio - loud bal qsos will be presented .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "some samples of radio emitting qsos existing in the literature are summarised , and among them a small sample of bal qsos is selected for multi - frequency continuum and polarisation observations . in section [ sec3 ] the observations , data reduction and the treatment of the errors are described . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the results of the observations are presented .",
    "the radio morphologies of bal qsos , their polarisation properties and the variability of some of these objects with 2-epoch observations are analysed .",
    "in addition , the shape of the radio spectra is described and the radio spectral index distributions of radio quasars with and without associated bals are compared .",
    "all these results are reviewed together in section [ sec6 ] and compared with other findings trying to put emphasis on those aspects related to the orientation vs. evolutionary dilemma .",
    "some of the limitations of the analysis are noted and solutions to some of these caveats are proposed .",
    "finally section [ sec7 ] summarises the main conclusions .",
    "the cosmology adopted within the paper assumes a flat universe and the following parameters : @xmath4=70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6=0.7 , @xmath7=0.3 .",
    "the adopted convention for the spectral index definition is @xmath8 , except where otherwise specified .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the morphologies and dimensions of the radio sources in bal qsos seem to be the keys to understand the orientation and evolutionary status of these sources .",
    "there is evidence that bal qsos are associated with compact radio sources , which are supposed to constitute a high fraction of the young population of radio sources , like e.g. , css or gps sources .",
    "@xcite noted that 90 per cent of their sample of radio - loud bal qsos ( extracted from the fbqs survey ) present point - like structure at the resolution of 5@xmath9 in contrast to the diversity of both point - like and extended sources they found within the whole population of fbqs quasars .",
    "in fact , only a few bal qsos are known to have an extended fr ii radio structure @xcite .",
    "our 22-ghz observations of the rbq sample confirm this tendency , because most sources appear unresolved at all frequencies constraining their apparent dimensions up to @xmath100.1 arcsec .",
    "this translates into projected linear sizes ( ls ) @xmath10 1 kpc which are typical of gps / css sources .",
    "it could be argued that an extended component with a steep spectrum might be present , observable only at lower frequencies , and thus being the source sizes larger than those found at high frequencies .",
    "this hypothesis is _ a priori _ no supported by the fact that most sources are still point - like at 1.4 ghz as can be seen in the first maps , with the exception of 1053@xmath300 .",
    "the radio spectra in figure [ synage_fits ] also display the typical convex shape of gps - like sources , in most cases with a peak at @xmath1 0.5@xmath310 ghz suggested by at least one or two points , or by upper limits at mhz frequencies .",
    "one concern about this result is that first or wenss flux densities were observed at different epochs and variability might be an issue , although noticeable flux density variations are likely to be stronger in the optically thin region of the spectrum .",
    "however , relatively deep integrations at mhz frequencies would be desirable to better constrain the shape of the spectra at low frequency .",
    "in addition , a project with vlbi multi - frequency observations and the analysis on the pc - scale properties of several bal qsos of the rbq sample has been started by us , and results will be presented in a subsequent paper .    if radio sources associated to bal qsos are actually css / gps sources , they should follow the anticorrelation between intrinsic turnover frequency and projected linear size found by @xcite for css sources .",
    "this was , for instance , quantified by @xcite in a combined sample of css and gps sources compiled by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this relationship was found to be valid for both galaxies and quasars .",
    "the anticorrelation suggests that the mechanism producing the turnover simply depends on the source size .",
    "figure [ nu_vs_ls_relation ] shows the relationship between intrinsic @xmath11 and projected ls for the samples of css and cps sources mentioned before , and we have also plotted for comparison our sample of radio - loud bal qsos .",
    "the turnover frequencies for the bal qsos appear in table [ listalpha ] while projected linear sizes have been extracted from the deconvolved sizes in table [ dec_sizes ] .",
    "a group of 5 bal qsos match quite well the distribution of css / gps sources , and they all show simple convex spectra , i.e. , 0728 + 40 , 1213 + 01 , 1312 + 23 , 1624 + 37 and 1625 + 48 .",
    "the three additional bal qsos displaying simple convex spectrum , 0039@xmath300 , 0256@xmath301 and 0957 + 23 are unresolved in our observations and their position can only be constrained by upper limits .",
    "nevertheless these 8 sources with simple complex spectrum are consistent with the correlation .    from the remaining 7 objects ,",
    "5 are resolved in our observations ( 0135@xmath302 , 0837 + 36 , 1228@xmath301 , 1413 + 42 and 1603 + 30 ) and they are located above the cloud of css / gps sources .",
    "all of them have in common a complex spectrum with indications of a double component . in these sources",
    "the turnover has been determined using the high frequency component but it is possible in the spectra of 1413 + 42 and 1603 + 30 to fit a second peak at lower frequencies ( at 0.7 and 0.8 ghz respectively ) .",
    "a second peak at low frequency could also be fitted to 1159 + 01 but we will not do that because being this source unresolved we can not give the exact location in the diagram .",
    "when considering the low frequency peaks of 1413 + 42 and 1603 + 30 in the diagram , these two sources also agree very well with the anticorrelation as shown in figure [ nu_vs_ls_relation ] .",
    "this better agreement could mean that the high - frequency part of these spectra could be dominated by the emission coming from a compact and active ( possibly beamed ) region smaller than the entire source , like a hot - spot .",
    "unfortunately we do not have enough data to check whether this could be the case also for 0135 - 02 , 0837 + 36 and 1228 - 01 .",
    "low - frequency data will be important to sample this part of the spectra to search for a possible second peak .",
    "again , vlbi observations are crucial to further investigate this interpretation .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that some gps sources associated to optical qsos can be just normal flat - spectrum quasars for which a jet / knot / hot - spot dominates the spectrum , which then adopts the characteristic convex shape of a gps source , as discussed e.g. by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have studied vlbi samples of gps sources and high frequency peakers ( hfp , 5 ghz @xmath12 10 ghz ) confirming this scenario .",
    "in fact , these `` contaminant '' quasars seem to be present , even in high percentages , in many well - defined samples of gps sources @xcite .",
    "two characteristics of `` genuine '' young gps radio sources are low polarisation and low variability @xcite , while flat - spectrum quasars show higher polarisation and variability .",
    "@xcite , who have used an extensive database of sources with multifrequency data from several long - term variability programs , define as `` bona fide '' gps sources those with a maximum variability @xmath133 . from our comparison in section [ sec4 ] which is , of course ,",
    "based on only two epochs we see that many sources do not show significant variations at 1.4 ghz , and 3 out of 5 inspected at 8.4 ghz show significant but not very strong variations",
    ". we can not thus exclude these sources from the candidates to young sources .",
    "as also shown in @xcite the maximum variations are found at high frequencies , so multi - frequency multi - epoch observations of the rbq sample will be very interesting for a more precise variability study .",
    "compact gps sources are supposed to be completely embedded in their narrow line region . on this basis",
    ", @xcite proposed the existence of a typical frequency - dependent scale , below which the gps source becomes completely depolarised , the so - called `` cotton effect '' .",
    "@xcite and later @xcite have confirmed this behaviour analysing the polarisation properties of the b3-vla css sample @xcite , and they propose models to describe the depolarising screen .",
    "the bal qsos in the rbq sample have probably physical sizes of @xmath10 1 kpc and if faraday effects are important they should be completely depolarised even up to relatively high frequencies .",
    "this is the case for all sources except 1159 + 01 at 1.4 ghz , and also for about 70 per cent of the sample at 8.4 ghz . at these two frequencies the upper limits obtained for the degree of linear polarisation are reasonably small . from table [ pol ]",
    "only 1312 + 23 seems to be weakly polarised at 8.4 and 22 ghz , but no polarisation was found at 15 ghz .",
    "the two exceptions are 1159 + 01 and 1624 + 37 . the first source is weakly polarised at 8.4 ghz but it is worth to note that the degree of linear polarisation increases as frequency decreases , becoming strongly polarised at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the opposite is expected when a depolarising plasma curtain is present .",
    "the reason for this anomalous behaviour might be that the emission at low frequencies arises from a different component , as suggested by the complex radio spectrum ( see figure [ synage_fits ] ) .",
    "an hypothetical extended structure with a relatively ordered magnetic field would contribute with substantial linear polarisation , and this may only be detected at low frequencies if a steep spectral index is assumed for the emission of this extended component .",
    "the moderate observed rotation measure of ( @xmath372.1 @xmath14 1.4 ) rad m@xmath15 in 1159 + 01 is consistent with the fact that it is strongly polarised in the nvss .",
    "should the rotation measure be much higher , the large bandwidth used for the nvss observations would produce a strong bandwidth depolarisation effect , probably hiding any measurable polarised intensity .",
    "the extreme rotation measure of j1624 + 37 , rm=@xmath318350 rad m@xmath15 @xcite which is the second highest value known among qsos and the highest among bal qsos , seems to be an exception and not representative of the bal qsos family .",
    "the median @xmath16 of the 5 polarised bal qsos in the rbq sample is @xmath11.3 per cent , but the remaining 10 bal qsos show @xmath171 . as a comparison",
    "@xcite found a median polarisation degree at 6 ghz of about 2 per cent in a subsample of quasars extracted from the sample of @xmath1400 compact sources of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found no significant differences between the median value of flat - spectrum cores and css quasars whereas that radio sources associated to galaxies or to empty fields ( no optical identifications ) were found to be less polarised at 6 ghz , with a median value of @xmath10.5 per cent .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a mean fractional polarisation of 1.2 and 1.8 per cent for gps and flat - spectrum quasars , respectively , and @xmath18 0.3 per cent for galaxies .",
    "the sources showing some polarisation in the rbq sample have probably polarised intensities consistent with flat - spectrum quasars .",
    "it is also likely that some of them ( e.g. , 1159 + 01 or 1603 + 30 ) can show polarised emission due to doppler boosted knots in jets , which is again compatible with their multi - component radio spectra peaking at high frequencies .",
    "however , our whole sample seem to be in better agreement with the gps class than with the class of flat - spectrum quasars , because of the high percentage of unpolarised or weakly polarised sources . of course , to firmly test this hypothesis it will be particularly interesting to do polarimetric multi - frequency observations of a radio brighter sample , which is now available after the recent releases of sdss .    as far as the spectral index distribution is concerned , the different statistical tests suggest that the spectral index distributions of bal and non - bal qsos are different .",
    "this difference is however due to the fact that all bal qsos in the sample have compact structures , while non - bal qsos have both extended and compact morphologies .",
    "when comparing the samples of bal qsos and compact non - bal qsos , no significant differences are found in the spectral index distributions .",
    "thus , from our comparison no preferred orientation can be attributed to bal qsos . when larger samples become available",
    ", the comparison of spectral indices of bal and non - bal qsos as a function of radio power and uv luminosity will be possible , allowing us to look for particular orientations in different bins of luminosity , as has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "* a sample of 15 bal qsos associated with first sources brighter than 15 mjy has been built .",
    "radio continuum observations for these sources have been collected from 2.6 up to 43 ghz in full polarisation .",
    "flux densities covering this radio range have been presented complemented by archive data at lower frequencies from 74 mhz up to 1.4 ghz . * vla maps in the most extended configuration show very compact morphologies for most sources at all frequencies being unresolved or slightly resolved at 22 ghz with a resolution of 80 mas .",
    "these translate into projected linear sizes @xmath10 1 kpc , which are the typical sizes of css / gps sources . *",
    "the spectra of these sources are typically convex , i.e. , they seem to become flat or inverted at mhz frequencies probably due to synchrotron self - absorption , while at frequencies higher than 15 ghz they are definitely steeper .",
    "the spectra typically peak between 1 and 5 ghz in the observer s frame and about 1/3 of the sample shows complex spectra suggesting different components . *",
    "all bal qsos in our sample presenting simple convex spectra follow the anticorrelation between projected linear size and turnover frequency found for css and gps sources .",
    "two bal qsos with complex radio spectra are also in agreement with this relationship if we consider the lower frequency peak of their spectra",
    ". the higher frequency peak might be in this two sources due to emission from a hot - spot or a knot in a jet .",
    "* a high percentage of the sample does not show significant variability when comparing the flux densities in 2 different epochs . some bal qsos show significant variability at 8.4 ghz but not strong enough to exclude them from the candidates to young radio sources .",
    "* most bal qsos in our list are not strongly polarized either at 1.4 ghz or at 8.4 ghz , and sensible upper limits are given at these frequencies .",
    "only two sources show significant polarisation at several frequencies . from these two , only the unusual bal 1624 + 37 has a high rotation measures suggesting strong depolarization .",
    "the median fractional polarisation of the sample is in better agreement to mean values found in css / gps sources , than those found for flat - spectrum quasars . *",
    "a series of statistical tests have been done to compare the spectral index distribution of bal and non - bal qsos finding that these distributions are different .",
    "however , no significant differences were found when comparing to compact non - bal qsos only .",
    "this is consistent with bal qsos spanning the same range of orientations as normal quasars with respect to our line of sight to them .",

    "<S> we present multi - frequency observations of a sample of 15 radio - emitting broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) , covering a spectral range between 74 mhz and 43 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> they display mostly convex radio spectra which typically peak at about 1 - 5 ghz ( in the observer s rest - frame ) , flatten at mhz frequencies , probably due to synchrotron self - absorption , and become steeper at high frequencies , i.e. , @xmath020 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> vla 22-ghz maps ( hpbw @xmath1 80 mas ) show unresolved or very compact sources , with linear projected sizes of @xmath21 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> about 2/3 of the sample look unpolarised or weakly polarised at 8.4 ghz , frequency in which reasonable upper limits could be obtained for polarised intensity . </S>",
    "<S> statistical comparisons have been made between the spectral index distributions of samples of bal and non - bal qsos , both in the observed and the rest - frame , finding steeper spectra among non - bal qsos . however constraining this comparison to compact sources results in no significant differences between both distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this comparison is consistent with bal qsos not being oriented along a particular line of sight . in addition , our analysis of the spectral shape , variability and polarisation properties shows that radio bal qsos share several properties common to young radio sources like compact steep spectrum ( css ) or gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources .    </S>",
