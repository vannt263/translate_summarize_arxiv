    "the goal of this note is to prove    [ mainthm ] let @xmath3 be an closed connected smooth spin 4-manifold",
    ". then there exists a closed orientable 4-manifold @xmath1 such that @xmath2 admits a conformally flat riemannian metric .",
    "our motivation comes from the following beautiful theorem of c.  taubes @xcite :    let @xmath0 be a smooth closed oriented 4-manifold . then there exists a number @xmath4 so that the connected sum of @xmath0 with @xmath4 copies of @xmath5 admits a half - conformally flat structure .    here",
    "@xmath5 is the complex - projective plane with the reversed orientation .",
    "recall that a riemannian metric @xmath6 on @xmath0 is _ anti self - dual _ ( or half - conformally flat ) if the self - dual part @xmath7 of the weyl tensor vanishes .",
    "vanishing of both self dual and anti self - dual parts of the weyl tensor ( i.e. , vanishing of the entire weyl tensor ) is equivalent to local conformal flatness of the metric @xmath6 .",
    "note that the assumption that @xmath0 is spin is equivalent to vanishing of all stiefel - whitney classes , which in turn is equivalent to triviality of the tangent bundle of @xmath8 .",
    "according to the hirsch - smale theory ( see for instance @xcite ) , @xmath9 is parallelizable iff @xmath10 admits an immersion into @xmath11 .",
    "thus , by taking @xmath0 to be simply - connected with nontrivial 2-nd stiefel - whitney class , one sees that @xmath2 does not admit a flat conformal structure for _ any @xmath1 _ : otherwise the developing map would immerse @xmath10 into @xmath11",
    ". therefore the vanishing condition is , to some extent , necessary .",
    "note also that ( unlike in taubes theorem ) one can not expect @xmath1 to be simply - connected since the only closed conformally flat simply - connected riemannian manifold is the sphere with the standard conformal structure .",
    "sonjong hwang in his thesis @xcite , has proven a 3-dimensional version of theorem [ mainthm ] ; moreover , he proves that one can use a connected sum of haken manifolds as the manifold @xmath1 .",
    "similar arguments can be used to prove an analogous theorem in the context of locally spherical cr structures on 3-manifolds .    the arguments in both 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional cases , in spirit (",
    "although , not in the technique ) , are parallel to taubes : one starts with a singular conformally - flat metric on @xmath0 , where the singularity is localized in a ball @xmath12 .",
    "the singular metric is obtained by pull - back of the standard metric on the 4-sphere under a branched covering @xmath13 .",
    "then , by attaching another manifold to @xmath0 along the singular locus ( which accounts for taking the connected sum @xmath14 ) , one `` resolves the singularity '' and constructs the desired flat conformal structure .    let @xmath15 be a closed connected smooth n - manifold , whose stiefel - whitney classes all vanish",
    ". then there exists a smooth closed orientable n - manifold @xmath1 such that @xmath2 admits a conformally flat riemannian metric .",
    "it seems very likely that this conjecture can be proven by methods analogous to the ones used in the present paper .",
    "the main technical problem is that the reflection groups used in the present paper do not exists in the higher dimensions .",
    "however , it is plausible that one can use instead arithmetic groups containing large number of reflections , as it is done in @xcite in a different context .    during the work on this paper",
    "the author was supported by the nsf grants dms-99 - 71404 and dms-02 - 03045 .",
    "we let @xmath16 denote the full group of moebius transformations of @xmath17 , i.e. the group generated by inversions in round spheres .",
    "equivalently , @xmath16 is the restriction of the full group of isometries @xmath18 to the @xmath19-sphere @xmath17 which is the ideal boundary of @xmath20",
    ". we will regard @xmath17 as 1-point compactification @xmath21 of then euclidean 4-space .",
    "[ inversion ] let @xmath22 be a unit cube in @xmath11 .",
    "we define the _ pl inversion _",
    "@xmath23 in the boundary of @xmath22 as follows .",
    "let @xmath24 be a pl homeomorphism which sends @xmath25 onto the round sphere @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the ordinary inversion in @xmath29",
    ". then @xmath30 .    a _ moebius _ or a _ flat conformal structure _ on a smooth @xmath19-manifold @xmath0",
    "is an atlas @xmath31 which consist of diffeomorphisms @xmath32 so that the transition mappings @xmath33 are restrictions of moebius transformations .",
    "equivalently , one can describe moebius structures on @xmath0 are conformal classes of conformally - euclidean riemannian metrics on @xmath0 .",
    "each conformal structure on @xmath0 gives rise to a local conformal diffeomorphism , called a _ developing map _",
    ", @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the universal cover of @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is connected , the mapping @xmath36 is equivariant with respect to a _ holonomy representation _ @xmath37 , where @xmath38 acts on @xmath35 as the group of deck - transformations .",
    "given a pair @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a representation of @xmath38 into @xmath16 and @xmath36 is a @xmath40-equivariant local diffeomorphism from @xmath35 to @xmath17 , one constructs the corresponding moebius structure on @xmath0 by taking a pull - back of the standard flat conformal structure on @xmath17 to @xmath35 via @xmath36 and then projecting the structure to @xmath0 .",
    "analogously , one defines a _ complex - projective structures _ on complex 3-manifold @xmath41 : it is a @xmath42-valued holomorphic atlas on @xmath41 so that the transition mappings belong to @xmath43 .",
    "the concept of moebius structure generalizes naturally to the category of orbifolds :    a 4-dimensional _ moebius orbifold _",
    "@xmath44 is a pair @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a hausdorff topological space , the _ underlying space of the orbifold _ , @xmath47 is a family of local parameterizations @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an open covering of @xmath46 , @xmath50 are open subsets in @xmath17 , @xmath51 are finite groups of moebius automorphisms of @xmath50 and the mappings @xmath52 satisfy the usual compatibility conditions :    if @xmath53 is the inclusion map then we have a moebius embedding @xmath54 which is equivariant with respect to a monomorphism @xmath55 , so that the diagram @xmath56 is commutative .",
    "the groups @xmath51 are the _ local fundamental groups _ of the orbifold @xmath44 .    for a moebius orbifold",
    "one defines a developing mapping @xmath57 ( which is a local homeomorphism from the universal cover @xmath58 of @xmath44 ) and , if @xmath44 is connected , a holonomy homeomorphism @xmath59 , which satisfy the same equivariance condition as in the manifold case .",
    "again , given a pair @xmath39 , where @xmath36 is a @xmath40-equivariant homeomorphism , one defines the corresponding moebius structure via pull - back .",
    "let @xmath60 be a subgroup acting properly discontinuously on an open subset @xmath61 .",
    "then quotient space @xmath62 has a natural moebius orbifold structure .",
    "the local charts @xmath63 appear in this case as restrictions of the projection @xmath64 to open subsets with finite stabilizers .",
    "in particular , suppose that @xmath65 is a finite subgroup of @xmath16 generated by reflections , the quotient @xmath66 can be identified with the intersection of a fundamental domain of @xmath65 with @xmath67 .",
    "the moebius structures on 4-dimensional manifolds and orbifolds constructed in this paper definitely do not arise this way .",
    "a more interesting example is obtained by taking a manifold @xmath0 and a local homeomorphism @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 . then we can pull - back the moebius orbifold structure on @xmath22 to an appropriate subset @xmath46 of @xmath0 , to get a 4-dimensional moebius orbifold .",
    "as another example of a pull - back construction , let @xmath44 be a moebius orbifold and @xmath70 be an orbifold cover such that @xmath0 is a manifold",
    ". then one can pull - back the moebius orbifold structure from @xmath44 to a usual moebius structure on @xmath0 .",

    "a collection of round balls @xmath72 in @xmath11 , with the nerve @xmath73 , we define the canonical simplicial mapping @xmath74 by sending each vertex of @xmath73 to the center of the corresponding ball and extending @xmath75 linearly to the simplices of @xmath73 . for",

    "subdivide each edge of @xmath78 by its midpoint .",
    "then inductively subdivide each @xmath4-cube @xmath22 in @xmath78 by coning off the barycentric subdivision of @xmath79 from the center of @xmath22 .",
    "= 3.5 in    suppose that @xmath80 is a 2-dimensional compact subcomplex such that each vertex belongs to a 2-cell .",
    "then there exists a collection of open round 4-balls @xmath81 , @xmath82 , centered at the vertices of @xmath77 , so that :    \\(1 ) the moebius inversions @xmath83 in the round spheres @xmath84 generate a discrete reflection group @xmath60 .",
    "\\(2 ) the complement @xmath85 is a fundamental domain @xmath86 of @xmath65 .",
    "\\(3 ) the canonical mapping from the nerve of @xmath87 to @xmath11 is a simplicial isomorphism onto @xmath77 .",
    "we begin by constructing the family of spheres @xmath88 centered at certain points of @xmath46 . for each square @xmath22 in @xmath46",
    "we pick 9 points @xmath89 : @xmath90 are the vertices of @xmath22 , @xmath91 are midpoints of the edges of @xmath22 and @xmath92 is the center of @xmath22 .",
    "we then take spheres @xmath93 of radius @xmath94 centered at the points @xmath95 and the spheres @xmath96 of radius @xmath97 centered at the points @xmath91 .",
    "see figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the reader will verify that :    \\1 .",
    "the spheres @xmath93 and @xmath98 are disjoint provided that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the spheres @xmath93 and @xmath101 intersect at the right angle , @xmath102 ; the spheres @xmath93 and @xmath101 intersect at the ( exterior ) angle @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the spheres @xmath93 and @xmath98 intersect at the ( exterior ) angle @xmath103 , provided that @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and are disjoint otherwise .",
    "suppose now that @xmath108 is a unit 4-cube , apply the above construction to each 2-face of @xmath108 .",
    "the reader will verify that the properties 13 of the spheres @xmath109 , ensure that the covering @xmath110 of @xmath111 has the nerve @xmath112 such that the canonical mapping @xmath113 is a simplicial isomorphism .",
    "now we are ready to construct the covering @xmath114 of the 2-complex @xmath78 . for each 2-face @xmath22 of @xmath78 introduce the family of nine round spheres @xmath109 constructed above , consider the inversions @xmath83 is these spheres ; the spheres @xmath109 bound balls @xmath114 . the fact that for each 4-cube @xmath108 the mapping @xmath113 is a simplicial isomorphism , implies that the mapping from the nerve of the covering @xmath114 to @xmath78 is a simplicial isomorphism as well .",
    "thus the exterior angles of intersections between the spheres equal @xmath115 and @xmath103 , thus we can apply poincare s fundamental polyhedron theorem @xcite to ensure that the intersection of the complements to the balls @xmath81 is a fundamental domain for the moebius group @xmath65 generated by the above reflections .    instead of collections of round balls based on a cubulation of @xmath11 one",
    "can use a periodic triangulation of @xmath11 , however in this case the construction of a collection of balls covering the 2-skeleton of a 4-simplex is slightly more complicated .",
    "recall that vanishing of all stiefel - whitney classes of the manifold @xmath0 implies that the manifold @xmath116 is parallelizable ; hence , by @xcite , there exists an immersion @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 denote a small open round ball centered at @xmath119 and let @xmath120 denote the complement @xmath121 .",
    "we retain the notation @xmath75 for the restriction @xmath122 .",
    "we next convert to the piecewise - linear setting , since in dimension 4 the categories of pl and smooth structures are the same it does not limit our discussion : cubulate the manifold @xmath0 so that @xmath123 is a subcomplex of the cubulation and that the restriction of @xmath75 to each 4-cube @xmath124 is a diffeomorphism onto a cube in the standard ( unit cube ) cubulation of @xmath11 . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that the mapping @xmath75 preserves the orientation .",
    "we now borrow the standard arguments from the proof of alexander s theorem which states that each closed @xmath125-dimensional pl manifold is a branched cover over the @xmath125-sphere , see e.g. @xcite . extend the map @xmath75 to a map @xmath126 on the ball @xmath118 so that the restriction of @xmath126 to each 4-cube is a diffeomorphism onto a cube in the standard cubulation of @xmath11",
    "now , for each cube @xmath127 such that @xmath128 is orientation - reversing we replace @xmath128 with the composition @xmath129 , where @xmath23 is the pl _ inversion _ in the boundary of the unit cube @xmath130 ( see definition [ inversion ] ) .",
    "the resulting mapping @xmath68 has the property that it is a local pl homeomorphism away from a 2-dimensional subcomplex @xmath131 .",
    "( note that @xmath132 has dimension 2 near every point : each vertex in @xmath132 belongs to a 2-cube . )",
    "thus the mapping @xmath133 is a branched covering over @xmath17 with the singular locus @xmath132 contained in the ball @xmath118 , the branch - locus of @xmath133 is the compact subcomplex @xmath134 . the branched covering @xmath133 has the property that for each point @xmath135 there exists a neighborhood @xmath136 such that @xmath137 is a disjoint union of balls @xmath138 , ( whose interiors contain @xmath139 ) , so that for each @xmath140 , the restriction @xmath141 is a branched covering onto @xmath142 . moreover , each branched covering @xmath141 is obtained by coning off a branched covering from the 3-sphere @xmath143 to the 3-sphere @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath144 denote a regular neighborhood of @xmath78 in @xmath11 , so that @xmath145 for each @xmath135 .",
    "next , subdivide the cubulation of @xmath11 and scale the subdivision up to the standard unit cubulation , so that the discrete group @xmath65 and the collection of balls @xmath146 associated with the subcomplex @xmath78 in section [ reflect ] have the properties :          for each ball @xmath154 centered at @xmath150 and for each @xmath155 , such that the restriction @xmath156 is _ not a homeomorphism onto its image _ , we let @xmath157 denote the inverse image @xmath158 .",
    "it follows that each @xmath157 is a polyhedral 4-ball in @xmath0 and the union of these balls is a tubular neighborhood @xmath159 of @xmath132 .",
    "the boundary of @xmath159 has a natural partition into subcomplexes : `` vertices '' , `` edges '' , `` 2-faces '' and `` 3-faces '' :    * the `` vertices '' are the points of triple intersections of the 3-spheres @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 . *",
    "the `` 2-faces '' are the connected components of the double intersections of the 3-spheres @xmath160 , @xmath161 . * the `` 3-faces '' are the connected components of the complements @xmath163    we declare each `` 3-face '' a boundary reflector of the orbifold @xmath44 .",
    "the dihedral angles between the balls @xmath148 define the dihedral angles between the boundary reflectors in @xmath44 .",
    "since the restriction @xmath164 is a local homeomorphism , this construction defines a moebius orbifold @xmath44 .",
    "the mapping @xmath165 is the projection of the developing mapping @xmath166 of this moebius orbifold .",
    "let @xmath167 denote the orbifold with boundary @xmath168 ; let @xmath22 be the closed orbifold obtained by attaching 4-disk @xmath169 along the boundary sphere @xmath170 .",
    "we now convert back to the smooth category .",
    "it is clear from the construction that the orbifold @xmath44 is obtained by ( smooth ) gluing of the manifold with boundary @xmath121 and the orbifold with boundary @xmath167 .",
    "hence @xmath44 is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of the manifold @xmath0 with the orbifold @xmath22 .",
    "we also note that all local fundamental groups of @xmath44 embed naturally into @xmath171 .",
    "it remains to construct a finite manifold covering @xmath172 over the orbifold @xmath44 , so that @xmath121 lifts homeomorphically to @xmath172 ; the construction is analogous to the one used by m.  davis in @xcite .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath171 is the free product @xmath173 .",
    "we have holonomy homomorphism @xmath174 the subgroup @xmath38 is contained in the kernel of this homomorphism ; by construction , the kernel of @xmath175 contains no elements of finite order .",
    "the coxeter group @xmath65 is virtually torsion - free , let @xmath176 be a homomorphism onto a finite group @xmath177 , so that @xmath178 is torsion - free and orientation - preserving",
    ". then the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath179 is a torsion - free finite index subgroup of @xmath171 , which contains @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath180 denote the finite orbifold cover corresponding to the subgroup @xmath181 .",
    "then @xmath172 is a smooth oriented conformally flat manifold , the submanifold @xmath121 lifts diffeomorphically into @xmath182 .",
    "thus the connected sum decomposition @xmath183 also lifts to @xmath172 , so that the latter manifold is diffeomorphic to the connected sum of @xmath0 and a 4-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a closed smooth 4-manifold with vanishing second stiefel - whitney class .",
    "then there exists a closed smooth 4-manifold @xmath1 so that @xmath184 admits a conformally - euclidean riemannian metric .",
    "the difference with theorem [ mainthm ] is that @xmath0 can be nonorientable .",
    "let @xmath185 be the orientable double cover with the deck - transformation group @xmath186 .",
    "then all stiefel - whitney classes of @xmath35 are trivial . as before ,",

    "consider a euclidean reflection @xmath190 in @xmath11 and an epimorphism @xmath191 .",
    "then , arguing as in the proof of phillips theorem @xcite , one gets a @xmath192-equivariant immersion @xmath193 .",
    "this yields a @xmath194-invariant flat conformal structure on @xmath195 via pull - back of the flat conformal structure from @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath196 be a @xmath194-invariant disjoint union of open balls around the points @xmath197 .",
    "then the rest of the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] goes through : replace the ball @xmath198 with a manifold with boundary @xmath199 so that the flat conformal structure on @xmath200 extends over @xmath199 . then glue a copy of @xmath199 along the boundary of @xmath201 in @xmath194-invariant fashion .",
    "note that the quotient of the manifold @xmath202 by the group @xmath194 is diffeomorphic to a closed manifold @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is obtained from @xmath199 by attaching the 4-ball along the boundary .",
