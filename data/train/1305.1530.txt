    "in the context of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite , the higgs mechanism  @xcite has been postulated to instigate electroweak symmetry breaking , which produces the electroweak @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons .",
    "the mechanism gives rise to a new scalar particle , the higgs boson , which has been the object of many experimental searches for the past few decades .    in july 2012 ,",
    "the atlas and cms experiments separately claimed discovery of a particle with a mass of 125  @xmath1that is consistent with a sm higgs boson interpretation  @xcite . to identify the new state as the sm higgs boson",
    ", however , requires that measurements of its couplings to fermions and electroweak bosons , as well as measurements of its production cross - sections and decay branching fractions are consistent with sm predictions . to this end , the tevatron experiments in august 2012 jointly claimed evidence of a new particle that decayed to a @xmath4pair that was consistent with the lhc discoveries and the sm predictions  @xcite .    whereas the primary sensitivities of the 125-@xmath1particle at the lhc are due to the relatively clean gluon - fusion @xmath5and @xmath6modes , where both @xmath3 bosons ( one produced on shell ) decay to pairs of leptons , the cross sections of such modes at the tevatron are largely suppressed due to the lower center - of - mass energy .",
    "the primary sensitivities in higgs boson searches at the tevatron , therefore , come mainly from the associated production modes ( @xmath7 ) , where the higgs boson is produced alongside an electroweak boson @xmath8 ( which represents the @xmath9 or @xmath3 ) , and the higgs boson decays via @xmath10 .    as the @xmath11-quarks are often produced at energies greater than 50  gevin the laboratory reference frame , they fragment into a cascade of less energetic particles , which eventually hadronize at the scale of @xmath12 .",
    "various reconstruction algorithms are optimized to collect as much energy of these `` jets '' ( and therefore the original @xmath11 quark ) as possible , without introducing extra energy from same - event particles that are unassociated with the original @xmath11-quark .",
    "although each experiment applies jet - energy corrections which adjust the jet energies back to the quark - level quantities , the rms of these corrections tends to be on the order of 10 - 20% of the overall scale . if a higgs boson that decays via @xmath10exists , the dijet invariant mass of the system is thus not able to constrain well the mass of the higgs boson , unlike the @xmath5and @xmath6searches .",
    "rather , the overall production rate , and other quantities must be used to place constraints on the allowed higgs boson mass at the tevatron experiments in this channel .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the current status of the individual tevatron higgs searches ( up to march 2013 ) , as well as the tevatron combinations at cdf , d0 , and the combined results from both experiments .",
    "for the combinations , in addition to excluding the higgs boson across a putative mass range of @xmath13  @xmath1 , we also present best - fit values of the cross - section times branching ratio , and place constraints on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings .",
    "we do not discuss fermiophobic or fourth - generation searches , which are presented in an upcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d0 experiments have many analyses in the final stages of presentation .",

    "are vetoed , ensuring orthogonality of data samples with respect to the cdf @xmath18 search .",
    "a minimum @xmath19requirement of 35  gevis made of the event to reduce background from events with two or more reconstructed jets produced by qcd ( `` qcd multijet '' ) , but where a significant energy imbalance occurs from jet - energy miscorrection .",
    "despite this requirement , qcd multijet backgrounds remain dominant , and multivariate algorithms are implemented to further separate the qcd background ( and other sm backgrounds ) from the higgs boson signal . to increase the signal - to - background ratios , the analysis is split into tagging categories based on the probability that the jets originated from @xmath11-quarks .",
    "to improve sensitivity to higgs boson exclusion relative to the previous analysis  @xcite , an updated @xmath11-tagging algorithm was implemented , which was specifically optimized for @xmath10searches  @xcite .",

    "however , the primary reason for the remaining change in the shift is due to significant event migration between the @xmath11-tagging categories of the previous analysis , and those of the updated one .",
    "a two - sided @xmath22-value was calculated to estimate that the remaining shift in observed limits between both analyses was due to statistical effects of event migration .",
    "accounting for the statistical correlations between the two analyses , and the correlations between each @xmath23 hypothesis , the probability that the non - systematic change in observed limits is due to statistical effects only is at the 3%-5% level .",
    "as no background mismodeling was observed in the updated analysis , and as applying the updated treatment of systematic uncertainties to the previous analysis did not significantly alter any of the previous results , we conclude that the significant shift in observed limits is due primarily to statistical effects of event migration . for further details ,",
