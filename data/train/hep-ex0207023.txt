    "heavy quark photoproduction and fragmentation at hera offers a novel way of testing both perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in this paper parton dynamics ( in terms of angular distributions ) and",
    "fragmentation will be addressed based on recent zeus measurements .",
    "a non - perturbative aspect of qcd can be measured by considering the spin dependence in fragmentation , which should in principle be sensitive to non - perturbative effects in the hadronisation process .",
    "zeus recently measured the fragmentation ratio p@xmath3 , ratio of vector/(vector + pseudoscalar ) .",
    "the value p@xmath4 can be calculated with respect to the ground - state charm mesons via the decay channels d@xmath5 @xmath6 d@xmath7 and d@xmath8 .    in this paper , the analysis  @xcite",
    "is based on @xmath2 and @xmath9 events with an almost real photon ( virtuality , @xmath10 gev@xmath11 ) in a photon - proton center - of - mass energy , w , in the range @xmath12 w @xmath13 gev . using @xmath14 m = m(d * ) - m(d@xmath15 ) as a @xmath0 tag , the sample is then further divided into @xmath9 mesons arising from and not from @xmath0 mesons . after this division",
    "there were @xmath16 events with a @xmath9 meson from a @xmath0 and @xmath17 inclusive @xmath9 meson events and the resulting value for p@xmath4 in the full phase space is :    p@xmath4 = 0.546 @xmath18 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20  @xcite measured in e@xmath21e@xmath22 annihilation .",
    "the angular distribution of outgoing partons in a hard partonic process is an efficient tool to study the parton dynamics of the underlying sub - processes . in leading order ( lo ) qcd these underlying sub - processes ( fig.1 ) can be divided into either direct photon or resolved photon processes . in direct",
    "photon processes the photon participates in the hard scatter predominantly via the boson - gluon fusion process .",
    "this process has a quark as the propagator in the hard interaction . in resolved photon processes the photon acts like a source of incoming partons ( quarks and gluons ) and only a fraction of its momentum participates in the hard scatter . in this case both quark and gluon propagators are possible .",

    "the variable @xmath23 , related to the momentum fraction of the parton from the photon , is defined as the fraction of the photon s energy participating in the production of the two highest transverse energy jets : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial photon energy .",
    "the normalised cross section as a function of @xmath23 is shown in fig.2(a ) compared with predictions from pythia  @xcite , herwig  @xcite and cascade  @xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , the photon acts as a point like object for direct photon events , thus this momentum fraction ( @xmath23 ) is expected to be populated around high @xmath23 .",
    "the significant cross section at low @xmath23 is consistent with the presence of resolved photon processes .",
    "the high and low @xmath23 region were studied in more details in terms of dijet angular distribution , which are sensitive to the spin of the propagator .",
    "fig.2(b ) shows the relative differential cross section as a funtion of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the angle between the jet - jet axis and the beam direction in the dijet rest frame .",
    "the distributions are enriched in direct photon ( @xmath28 ) or resolved photon ( @xmath29 ) events .",
    "the measured differential cross section @xmath30(all @xmath23 ) @xmath31 for both of these samples are significantly different , indicating that the dominant mechanism for direct photon like events proceed via @xmath32exchange ( spin@xmath33 propagator , @xmath34 ( @xmath35)@xmath36 ) , while resolved photon like events are dominated by @xmath37exchange ( spin@xmath38 propagator , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 are @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; the other diagrams show asymmetry either in the photon(negative ) or proton(positive ) hemisphere . in order to study this behaviour of the matrix elements ,",
    "the charm - initiated jet , @xmath0 jet , and the other jet were separated in @xmath43 space ( @xmath14r@xmath44 @xmath45 ; with @xmath0 jet having the smallest @xmath14r@xmath46 ) .",
    "thus the sign of the unfolded @xmath47 distribution is given by the direction of the @xmath0 meson ( positive for proton direction ) .",
    "fig.3(b ) shows the differential cross - section @xmath30(all @xmath23 ) @xmath48 for both direct and resolved enriched samples .",
    "the shaded areas for @xmath29 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the contamination of the genuine direct and resolved pythia contributions . the resolved enriched events in the photon hemisphere exhibit a strong rise towards large negative @xmath47 values , consistent with @xmath37exchange diagrams as expected from the matrix element distribution fig.3(a ) .",
    "the only @xmath37exchange diagrams with this topology come from @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( fig.1(a)-(b ) ) , where @xmath51 originates from the photon . on the other hand , in the proton hemisphere ,",
    "a mild rise towards large positive @xmath47 is observed , which is consistent with the @xmath32exchange diagrams ( fig.1(c ) ) .",
    "these observations provide clear evidence that the bulk of the resolved photon contribution is due to the charm content of the photon , rather than to the more conventional resolved process @xmath52 .",
    "the direct enriched events are consistent with @xmath53 ( fig.1(e ) ) .",
    "the slight asymmetry in the @xmath54 distribution can be accounted for by the contamination from genuine resolved events , as given by pythia .",
    "( -310,-10)(a ) ( -150,-10)(b )",
    "the measurement of p@xmath4 is consistent with the universality of the charm fragmentation .",
    "dijet angular distributions provide an important tool for understanding the heavy quark production and dynamics of underlying sub - processes .",
    "the @xmath55 distribution for dijet events with a @xmath0 shows a clear signature of gluon propagator for events with @xmath56 , suggesting strong evidence that they mainly originate from the charm content of the photon .",
