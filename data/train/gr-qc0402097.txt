    "the interaction of gravitational waves with such antennae was thought by many to be dominated by the heavy nuclear masses within the metal .",
    "the interaction with the lighter electron masses was considered to be negligible .",
    "this view is valid only for static newtonian gravity , which couples to the mass density @xmath0 .",
    "we have recently shown@xcite that gravitational waves couple into the pressure tensor @xmath1 , and the pressure is dominated by electronic motions .",
    "thus , the electronic coupling to the gravitational wave can not be ignored .",
    "the condensed matter hamiltonian required to understand the coupling of the electrons to the gravitational wave is the sum of kinetic energies of the electrons and the nuclei plus the coulomb interactions between all of the charged particles .",
    "some standard models of the solid state which employ free electron and free phonon gases together with a weak electron - phonon interaction are inadequate@xcite for the description of electron - graviton interactions since terms leading to highly excited virtual electronic states have been incorrectly thrown away .",

    "model hamiltonians are considered in sec.[cm ] . from the hamiltonian",
    "one can compute the pressure tensor which determines the interaction between the gravity wave and the antenna .",
    "the exact result is then the kinetic pressure plus the maxwell field pressure .",
    "the coulomb terms in the maxwell stress tensor are crucially important for understanding the mutual interactions between electrons , phonons and gravitons as discussed in sec.[gi ] . in sec.([absorb ] ) the rigorous expression for the single graviton absorption cross section is exhibited and shown to be expressed directly and rigorously in terms of the non - local viscosity of the crystal . since the electrons dominate the viscosity , they also dominate the absorption cross section .",
    "the metal bar may be described by a hamiltonian @xmath2 which consists of the kinetic energy @xmath3 of the nuclei and the kinetic energy @xmath4 of the electrons all interacting with the coulomb law @xmath5 , @xmath6 the pressure implied by eq.([coulombus ] ) is dominated by the electronic motions rather than the nuclear motions so that the electronic coupling to the gravitational wave becomes crucial for determining the detection efficiency .",
    "we have found that the efficiency induced by including the electronic coupling to gravity is considerably enhanced above the efficiency found by including only the nuclear coupling to gravity .",

    "( ii ) phonon modes are derived in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "( iii ) the non - adiabatic excitation interaction matrix hamiltonian is replaced by a local electron deformation potential @xmath10 .",

    "for example , with the help of the full maxwell stress tensor one computes the pressure matrix elements including highly excited virtual non - adiabatic excited states , @xmath33 in which the electron pressure @xmath34 included in ( @xmath35 ) also has a similar structure for the intermediate states .",

    "@xmath53 in low temperature metals has been experimentally well established@xcite .",
    "since the cross section for the absorption of gravity waves is rigorously determined by the viscosity response function , it is then evident that electrons dominate over the nuclear motions with regard to gravity wave absorption .",

    "the electronic motions control the pressure and thereby control the viscosity .",

    "since viscosity also damps gravitational waves , it seem natural that electronic motions should play a key role for gravitational wave detection .    to understand the importance of electronic - gravitational wave interactions from a microscopic viewpoint , one must keep the correct virial theorem pressure contributions for both the coulomb energy and kinetic energy .",
    "these contributions have been correctly computed in previously discussed viscosity sum rules@xcite .",
    "the sum rules dictate that the full inclusion of the coulomb interactions be present in an adequate microscopic theory .",
    "an inadequate model of pressure matrix elements consists of electrons and phonons as two ideal gas components weakly interacting with one another . in such weakly coupled electron - phonon models ,",
    "the electronic coulomb interactions are ignored , removing the strongly non - adiabatic matrix elements required for proper strength of electron - hole virtual excitations .",
