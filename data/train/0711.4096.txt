    "surveys for transient sources may detect gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows . in this paper , we call an `` orphan '' afterglow _ any _ afterglow associated with such serendipitous searches , as opposed to `` triggered '' grb afterglows , localized through the preceding prompt @xmath0-ray emission . rhodes ( 1997 ) suggested that these surveys could be used to put constraints on the geometrical beaming angle of the grb jets in the `` top - hat '' ( thereafter th ) model . in this model ,",
    "grbs are assumed to be uniformly emitting within a cone of angle @xmath1 with sharp edges , where the luminosity drops suddenly to an undetectable level .",
    "the suggestion by rhodes ( 1997 ) is based on the fact that the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is relativistically beamed within an angle @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "thus , if the line of sight lies outside this angle , the grb is unlikely to be detected .",
    "however , as the outflow slows down in the afterglow phase , the visible region increases to eventually encompass the observer s line of sight . at late times ,",
    "@xmath4 and the emission is roughly isotropic .",
    "this behaviour would suggest that more long - wavelength transients than @xmath0-ray ones may be expected .",
    "detections of transients at different wavelengths may thus be used to constrain the beaming factor @xmath5 .",
    "a measure of this quantity would be of great importance as it would allow one to calibrate @xmath1 and then estimate the true grb rates ( @xmath6 ) and energetics ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "searches for oas have been performed at various wavelengths , but none of them has yielded a firm detection .",
    "several authors have used observations in the radio band to constrain the grb rate and energetics ( e.g. perna & loeb 1998 ; woods & loeb 1999 ; paczyski 2001 ; levinson 2002 ; gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 ) , since late time ( i.e. nearly isotropic ) afterglow emission peaks in this band .",
    "the simplest and most common assumption is that the predicted number of oas in a snapshot observation is _ proportional _ to the beaming factor .",
    "perna & loeb ( 1998 ) used the lack of detections to set an upper limit of @xmath8 .",
    "more recently , levinson et al . ( 2002 ) and gal - yam et al . ( 2006 ) compared their data with a more detailed model for radio afterglows .",
    "they showed that the number of expected oas in a flux limited survey is _ inversely _ proportional to @xmath9 and they place a lower limit of @xmath10 .",
    "x - ray survey data have been used to search for oas by grindlay ( 1999 ) and by greiner et al . ( 2000 ) , while optical searches have been more numerous ( schaefer et al . 2002 ; vanden berk et al . 2002",
    "; becker et al . 2004 ; rykoff et al . 2005 ; rau et al .",
    "2006 , malacrino et al .",
    "2007 ) . using shorter wavelengths than radio to constrain the beaming factor necessarily",
    "requires a careful comparison with theoretical predictions ( e.g. totani & panaitescu 2002 ; nakar , piran & granot 2002 ) , since the emission is likely to be still relativistically beamed when oas are detected in those bands .",
    "malacrino et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2007b ) put the tightest optical constraints so far ( see their fig.3 ) .",
    "their non - detection resulted in an upper limit for the number of oas on the sky that is marginally consistent with the predictions of totani & panaitescu ( 2002 , thereafter tp02 ) and consistent with nakar et al .",
    "( 2002 , thereafter n02 ) and zou et al .",
    "( 2007 , thereafter z07 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to predict results for searches of afterglows in surveys , for a different grb jet structure .",
    "currently , oa surveys generally aim at constraining the jet angle .",
    "however , if grb outflows are _ not _ geometrically beamed but they rather have an anisotropic luminosity distribution , the interpretation of data within the th scenario would be misleading",
    ".    numerical simulations of collapsing massive stars ( e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) show that the jet emerges from the star with an energy distribution @xmath11 and lorentz factor @xmath12 that vary as a function of the angle @xmath13 from the jet axis .",
    "it has been shown ( rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ; zhang &  2002 ) that , if @xmath14 the diversity of afterglow light curves can be ascribed to different viewing angles within the context of an universal structured jet ( usj ) . in the usj model , the outflow is geometrically wide . in this paper , we will postulate that for each grb two simultaneous and opposite jets with @xmath15 are produced . in this model @xmath16 .",
    "the feature of having emission into @xmath17 solid angle is attractive since it can explain the lack of oa detections , while the non - uniform energy distribution allows one to avoid the huge energy requirement , demanded by grbs with an isotropic equivalent energy @xmath18 ergs ( e.g.  grb 990123 ) .",
    "an important consequence of the energy distribution law @xmath14 is that it establishes a unique relation between the viewing angle and the observed luminosity , once a radiation efficiency law with angle is assumed .",
    "thus , unlike in the th model , the observed luminosity function is not a free parameter .",
    "consequently , the uncertainties in the predicted oa rates in the usj scenario are smaller than in the th model ( see   [ sec : usjvsuj ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the usj framework to compute the expected number of transients in an all - sky snapshot and their rate as a function of the survey sensitivity .",
    "the aim is pursued by means of monte carlo simulations of the afterglow properties , as observed by x - ray , optical and radio surveys .",
    "the procedure is described in ",
    "[ sec : simule ] .",
    "we show prospects for oa detections with current and future surveys in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "this allows us to identify the best survey characteristics to increase the chance of detection and single out the most promising future missions .",
    "a comparison of our results with the top - hat predictions is performed in   [ sec : usjvsuj ] .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude our work in ",
    "[ sec : fine ] .    throughout the paper , we assume a flat universe with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we use monte carlo methods to simulate the population of grb orphan afterglows in the usj .",
    "grbs are randomly generated on the sky with a probability distribution in redshift that traces the star formation rate ( sfr ) (   [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "we use the external shock model to compute the afterglow luminosity curve (   [ sec : code ] ) .",
    "the probability function for the viewing angle @xmath13 is given by the fraction of the solid angle associated with that angle , @xmath22 .",
    "our simulation yields for radio , optical and x - ray bands the distribution of afterglow fluxes and the total number of afterglows on the sky for a snapshot observation , together with the average time @xmath23 that an afterglow remains detectable in the sky , as a function of the detection threshold . finally , we compute the oa detection rate for any flux limited survey where the observation time is much greater than @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that the grb population in the universe is described by a redshift - independent luminosity function , a redshift distribution and a distribution of the spectral parameters .    in the usj , the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy in the afterglow phase has the angular dependence e ( ) = , [ eq : usj ]    where the bright central spine with angular size @xmath25 has a maximum kinetic energy @xmath26 .",
    "the expected luminosity function follows from @xmath27 ( rossi et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 [ erg s@xmath30 is the isotropic equivalent bolometric peak luminosity and @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ec ] ) . in equation",
    "[ eq : lumfun ] , we assume that the @xmath24ray emission efficiency and the ratio of mean luminosity to peak luminosity is independent of the angle .    the grb comoving rate @xmath33 [ yr@xmath34 mpc@xmath35 is assumed to follow the comoving rate @xmath36 [ yr@xmath34 mpc@xmath35 of type ii supernovae @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a free parameter of the model .",
    "we assume that these arise from stars with masses above 8 @xmath39 and that the initial mass function has a salpeter form ( e.g. porciani & madau 2001 ) .",
    "daigne , rossi @xmath40 mochkovitch ( 2006 , thereafter drm06 ) found that the above prescription is dubious for redshift greater than 2 .",
    "however , most of the oas that are detected in a survey are located at lower redshifts , where this assumption appears to hold . in our analysis , we find , in fact , that the mean oa redshift for any reasonable flux threshold is never greater than @xmath41 . the star formation rate we adopt to derive @xmath42 ( dubbed sfr@xmath43 ) and its comparison with data ( hopkins 2004 ) are shown in fig .  1 of drm06 .",
    "this sfr saturates beyond @xmath44 at a level of 0.2 m@xmath45 yr@xmath34 mpc@xmath46 . even though this behavior is consistent with data at the one sigma level , the flat extrapolation of our sfr after the peak remains questionable , since high - z data are plagued by uncertainty on the amount of dust extinction",
    "however , as discussed above , we do not expect that uncertainties in the high - z behaviour of @xmath33 appreciably affect our results .",
    "the grb redshift probability function is thus given by @xmath47 where the comoving volume equals @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the standard luminosity distance .",
    "the spectral properties of grbs are described by the distribution of their peak energy @xmath50 and their low and high - energy slopes @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the peak energy ,",
    "we assume a log - normal distribution with a mean value @xmath53 and a dispersion 0.3 dex .",
    "for the slopes , we adopt the observed distribution by preece et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the grb population is entirely described by four free parameters : @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the luminosity function , @xmath56 for the comoving rate and @xmath57 for the spectral properties . following the method described in drm06",
    ", we constrained them by fitting simultaneously : i ) the @xmath58 distribution of grbs ( where @xmath59 [ ph @xmath60 s@xmath30 is the peak flux ) detected by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; kommers et al .",
    "2000 ; stern et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) ; ii ) the peak energy distribution of bright batse bursts ( preece et al . 2000 ) ; and iii ) the hete2 fraction of x - ray rich grbs and x - ray flashes ( sakamoto et al .",
    "for a given set of parameters @xmath61 , a population of @xmath62 grbs is randomly generated , with a redshift @xmath63 , a luminosity @xmath29 and a spectrum characterized by a peak energy @xmath50 and a low and a high - energy slope @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the four free parameters are then adjusted to minimize the @xmath64 obtained when comparing the simulated data with the three observations listed above .",
    "more details about the procedure can be found in drm06 .",
    "the results for the best fit are @xmath65)= 53.7\\pm 0.6 $ ] and @xmath66 for the luminosity function , @xmath67 for the comoving rate and @xmath68}\\right)}=2.8\\pm 0.1 $ ] for the spectrum .",
    "the reduced @xmath69 for 37 degrees of freedom .",
    "we note here that drm06 , assuming a power - law luminosity function , found @xmath70 as the best fit value for the slope when this is free to vary , as opposed to the slope @xmath71 predicted by the usj model ( eq .  [ eq : lumfun ] ) .",
    "however , an acceptable @xmath64 is also obtained in our case .      the afterglow emission",
    "is modeled as synchrotron radiation from a relativistic blast - wave propagating in a constant density external medium ( e.g.   & rees 1997 ) .",
    "we ignore the contribution from the reverse shock , although it dominates the afterglow emission in the first few tens of seconds after the grb ( sari & piran 1999 ) , since oa observations occur much later .",
    "for the same reason , our results are largely independent of the choice of the initial lorentz factor ( which we fix at @xmath72 = 300 ) , since the deceleration time is unlikely to exceed @xmath73 s ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "similar considerations of timing allow us to neglect the modelling of the early afterglow features ( flares , plateau , etc .. , e.g. nousek et al .",
    "2006 ) , that are not reproduced by the standard external shock model .",

    "the luminosity function parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath25 , constrained by the prompt emission data (   [ sec : sfr ] ) allow us to determine the kinetic energy distribution within the jet ( eq .  [ eq : usj ] ) , since    @xmath75    inspection of current data suggests that the proportionality constant is of the order of 1 second .",
    "the @xmath24ray efficiency @xmath76 that is inferred from modeling data in the standard external - internal shock scenario is rather high , between @xmath77 50% and @xmath7790% ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) .",
    "this uncertainty together with the one @xmath78 range of @xmath31 imply @xmath79 .",
    "we adopt @xmath80 erg .",
    "since the core angle is not strongly constrained by prompt emission data ( see  [ sec : sfr ] ) , we adopt a value at the low end of the one @xmath78 range , @xmath81 , to account for the observed breaks in the lightcurves on day timescales . the external shock and density parameters are chosen from the ranges of values inferred from afterglow modeling ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2001 ; panaitescu 2005 ) . the fraction of energy at the shock that goes into accelerated electrons and magnetic field is @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively ;",

    "if we consider , as for the sdss , an area of 9583 @xmath163 , we expect @xmath164 oas .    the plan is for the allen telescope array ( ata ) to observe @xmath165 at mjy sensitivity and later to go as deep as @xmath166  mjy at 5ghz .",
    "the expected number of oas would then rise from a few to 50 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : thcomp ] , we compare our results for @xmath114 ( solid line ) with published predictions for the th model in r - band ( dashed lines ) . from bottom to top",
    ", we plot the  standard  model by z07 ; the  preferred  and the  optimistic ",
    "models by n02 and the model by tp02 .",
    "the curves from these works have similar slopes but they vary in normalisation by several orders of magnitude . the main difference is the assumed afterglow luminosity function .    this is the result of different choices for the opening angle and total jet energy distributions and the afterglow radiation efficiency .",
    "z07 assume constant total ( beamed corrected ) energy @xmath167 erg and a power - law distribution of opening angles @xmath168 .",
    "n02 assume constant peak flux at @xmath169 and a fixed average opening angle @xmath170 ( `` canonical '' model ) and @xmath171 ( `` optimistic '' model ) .",
    "finally , tp02 assume that the whole grb population is represented by 10 well - studied events .",
    "we also note that within each model there is an order of magnitude uncertainty .",
    "for example , zou et al .",
    "results differ by an order of magnitude between @xmath172 erg and @xmath173 erg ( their fig .  4 ) .",
    "these uncertainties in the th model are due to the fact that neither the opening angle distribution nor the total jet energy distribution is uniquely defined by the model or unbiasely determined by observations ( e.g. through the observed luminosity function ) .",
    "the usj model , instead , has more predictive power , since it has less degrees of freedom .    from the comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : thcomp ] , one concludes that our model predictions fall roughly in the middle of the range of published results for the th model .",
    "the differences in the predictions between our model and any _ individual _ th model are large enough to be significant , but there is a sufficiently wide class of plausible th models to encompass almost any luminosity function of oa that might be observed in the future . in principle , therefore , oa observations could rule out the usj model ( noting of course that there is a similar level of uncertainty to our predictions as individual th models ) , but the same can not be said for the th model",
    ". the th model could be tested by a combination of orphan afterglow observations and independent constraints on the parameters of the model .",
    "the realization that grbs may be jetted has triggered studies of orphan afterglows .",
    "early studies assumed that the prompt grb emission comes from a sharp jet , in which case the ratio of afterglows to that of grbs yields a constraint on the grb beaming fraction ( or equivalently the opening angle of the grb jet ) .",
    "this parameter is of importance for a proper assessment of grb rates and energetics .",
    "the structured jet model has offered an equivalent explanation for afterglow phenomenology .",
    "however , its interpretation of the lightcurve breaks is different : they would arise from viewing angle effects and not from geometrical collimation .",
    "in fact , if grb jets are indeed structured , most , if not all , afterglows should be generally preceded by a prompt emission pointing towards the observer . therefore , even if in practice the relative number of detections in various bands depends on the survey strategy , the ratio should tend to unity ( @xmath16 ) if events are detectable at arbitrarily low fluxes .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the detection prospects of afterglows for flux limited surveys , in the usj framework .",
    "we conclude that large sky coverage is essential in all bands .",
    "in addition , x - ray and radio instruments should push their flux limit below @xmath174 erg s@xmath34 @xmath60 ( at 1 kev ) and @xmath175 mjy ( at 5 ghz ) respectively .",
    "current and planned x - ray surveys are thus not suited for oas searches , if the jet is structured .",
    "the first and the future ata projects could be successful in detecting radio oas .",
    "the potential is even better for future optical all - sky surveys , such as gaia and pan - starrs .",
    "we also note that it would be worthwhile to exploit the great sensitivity of the suprime - cam , for which 5 - 10% of the whole sky is sufficient for positive detections . certainly , a combination of x - ray , optical and radio observations would yield the most of information and will help understanding whether the usj describes correctly the structure of the jet .",
    "we are very grateful to t.  totani and a.  panaitescu for providing us with their data for the th predictions .",
    "we also acknowledge very useful discussions with g. bower and e. nakar .",
