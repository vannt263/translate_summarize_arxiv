    "metal - organic systems with a 3d@xmath6 electron configuration , such as in cu@xmath7 , are expected to undergo a jahn - teller distortion . in octahedral coordination , this typically elongates one axis of the octahedron and removes the degeneracy of the e@xmath8 orbitals d@xmath9 and d@xmath10 .",
    "this effect widely occurs in molecular systems as well as in other materials such as the colossal magnetoresistance manganites.@xcite the jahn - teller distortion is extremely sensitive to bond distances and as such applied pressure can strongly influence or even induce a jahn - teller distortion .",
    "depending on the elongation axis in the crystal structure , the pattern of orbital overlaps and related exchange interactions can vary significantly in turn leading to disparate magnetic ground states .",
    "finding materials where a jahn - teller distortion can be tuned to act as a magnetic switch has potential for applications in technological devices and , thus , is of great interest .",
    "the copper - based coordination polymer magnet cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) ( pyz = pyrazine ) appears to be a model material for studying the switching of magnetic properties due to changes in the jahn - teller axis.@xcite cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) crystallizes in a monoclinic structure ( space group p2@xmath11/c ) with a=7.6926  , b=7.5568 , c=6.897 and @xmath12=111.065@xmath13 under ambient conditions.@xcite the structure consists of cuf@xmath0o@xmath0n@xmath0 octahedra which form a 2d network in the bc plane .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility shows a broad peak at 10.5 k consistent with two dimensional ( 2d ) short range correlations and three dimensional long - range order below t@xmath14 = 2.6 k due to weak coupling along the a - axis . at ambient pressure , the jahn - teller axis is along the n - cu - n axis ( a direction ) .",
    "hence the d@xmath9 magnetic orbital lies in the bc plane to form a two dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) quasi square lattice where the near neighbor distances are the same , but the interior angles deviate by @xmath1 @xmath55@xmath15 .",
    "first principles electronic structure calculations confirm this configuration.@xcite these calculations give an intra - plane afm exchange interaction of about 13 to 19 k and an inter - plane afm exchange interaction of only 1% of the intra - plane exchange interaction .",
    "an important feature of cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) is that under an applied pressure of 0.9 gpa , a switch of the jahn - teller axis from the n - cu - n to the o - cu - o ( c direction ) bond occurs.@xcite when pressure increases to 3.1 gpa , the jahn - teller axis switches again from o - cu - o bond to f - cu - f bond ( b direction ) .",
    "correspondingly the magnetic interactions are expected to vary at different pressures : from the ambient pressure 2d quasi square lattice ( exchange path cu - f@xmath16h - o - cu ) to one dimensional ( 1d ) chain interactions ( exchange path cu - pyz - cu ) at 0.9 gpa .",
    "indeed , the magnetic susceptibility at ambient pressure can be well described by the 2 d heisenberg square lattice @xcite while above 0.9 gpa the magnetic susceptibility exhibits a broad peak consistent with 1d magnetic correlations@xcite .",
    "therefore a microscopic understanding of the magnetic properties at ambient pressure would be an illuminating step towards a complete understanding of the interesting pressure dependent behavior of cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a study of deuterated cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) ( cuf@xmath0(d@xmath0o)@xmath0(d@xmath17-pyz ) ) with elastic and inelastic neutron scattering under ambient pressure .",
    "the neutron diffraction results show that the sample has a collinear afm structure with the moments lying in ac - plane along the [ 0.7 0 1 ] direction .",
    "the spin wave dispersion extracted from the inelastic neutron spectra can be well described by a nearest - neighbor 2d heisenberg model .",
    "the spin wave dispersion found along the inter - layer direction could not be observed within the instrumental resolution of fwhm=0.034 mev .",
    "this indicates that the inter - layer exchange interaction @xmath4 is weak as expected for a 2d system where the spin wave dispersion does not depend on the out of plane direction .",
    "consequently , cuf@xmath0(h@xmath0o)@xmath0(pyz ) is a good example of quasi-2d system where the spin wave dispersion depends exclusively on k and l. within the 2d magnetic plane , the dispersion along the zone boundary points has been measured and is in accord with prediction of the quantum monte carlo and series expansion calculations@xcite for quantum fluctuation corrections to linear spin wave theory for the s=1/2 square lattice heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "in order to minimize attenuation of the beam caused by the large incoherent scattering cross - section of hydrogen , fully deuterated cuf@xmath0(d@xmath0o)@xmath0(d@xmath17-pyz ) crystals were synthesized for this study .",
    "substitution of deuterium for hydrogen does not alter the crystal symmetry and induces only small changes in the lattice parameters.@xcite to ensure that structural parameters of the samples studied here are in accord with previously published values@xcite neutron diffraction data ( not shown ) were collected on the four circle neutron diffractometer hb-3a at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) , oak ridge national laboratory .",

    "<S> this value is significantly smaller than the single ion magnetic moment , reflecting the presence of strong quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave dispersion from magnetic zone center to the zone boundary points ( 0.5 1.5 0 ) and ( 0.5 0 1.5 ) can be described by a two dimensional heisenberg model with a nearest neighbor magnetic exchange constant @xmath3 = 0.934 @xmath1 0.0025 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - layer interaction @xmath4 in this compound is less than 1.5% of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin excitation energy at the ( 0.5 0.5 0.5 ) zone boundary point is reduced when compared to the ( 0.5 1 0.5 ) zone boundary point by @xmath5 10.3 @xmath1 1.4 % . </S>",
    "<S> this zone boundary dispersion is consistent with quantum monte carlo and series expansion calculations for the s=1/2 heisenberg square lattice antiferromagnet which include corrections for quantum fluctuations to linear spin wave theory . </S>"
