    "the de sitter spacetime is an extensively studied solution of the gravitational field equations .",
    "it is a maximally symmetric spacetime and due to its simplicity it is the appropriate background to explore and test several ideas and methods @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if a spacetime with an event or cosmological horizon is perturbed , it is well known that the perturbation oscillates with a set of decaying modes , usually called quasinormal modes ( qnm ) , whose complex frequencies are determined by the physical parameters of the background .",
    "they have been calculated for several spacetimes ( see the reviews @xcite-@xcite ) and they are useful in the study of several physical phenomena @xcite-@xcite .    the quasinormal frequencies ( qnf ) of the de sitter spacetime have been determined in several references @xcite@xcite .",
    "we know the qnf of classical fields propagating in lower @xcite@xcite and higher @xcite@xcite dimensional de sitter spacetimes .",
    "moreover , the recent reviews @xcite , @xcite examine some of these results . for @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) de sitter spacetimes , in ref .  @xcite it is asserted that for @xmath0 even , the qnf of the gravitational perturbations are not well defined , and we notice that this affirmation is reproduced in the review @xcite ( see also appendix a of @xcite for a similar conclusion for the massless klein - gordon field in the four - dimensional de sitter spacetime ) . nevertheless in ref .",
    "@xcite it is asserted that for even and odd dimensional de sitter spacetimes the qnf of massless fields are well defined ( a similar affirmation appears in the review @xcite ) .",
    "the values of the de sitter qnf have found several applications , for example , they have been used in the calculation of the green functions that are necessary to discuss some aspects of static patch holography @xcite , in the computation of the one - loop thermal partition function for the scalar field @xcite , and in the determination of the entropy spectrum for the de sitter horizon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus we must state clearly the existence and properties of the de sitter qnm .    here using a different method",
    "we prove the classical stability of the de sitter qnm .",
    "this method is motivated by a procedure used to show the stability of the qnm in asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes @xcite . moreover , to solve the mentioned issue on the existence of the de sitter qnf in even dimensions and employing a straightforward procedure we determine the de sitter qnf of the gravitational perturbations .",
    "finally we discuss some properties of the radial functions for the gravitational de sitter qnm .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s : stability ] we establish the classical stability of the de sitter qnm . to achieve this goal",
    "we modify a method by horowitz and hubeny that is suitable for asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes @xcite . to prove the classical stability of the qnm for the klein - gordon and dirac fields we find that it is necessary to elaborate on the method by horowitz and hubeny . in sect .",
    "[ s : gravitational qnm ] we calculate the qnf of the gravitational perturbations propagating in the @xmath0-dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "we compute these with a simpler method than the procedure used in the previous references and discuss some properties of the radial functions for the de sitter qnm . in sect .",
    "[ s : discussion ] we enumerate our results . finally ,",
    "in appendix we analyze the absence of qnf for the klein - gordon field with special values of the mass and the azimuthal number that propagates in four - dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "in what follows we consider the @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) spherically symmetric de sitter spacetime @xcite , @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the round metric on the @xmath4-sphere .",
    "as is well known , this background has a cosmological horizon . in the units chosen in the metric ( [ e : metric de sitter spacetime ] ) the horizon",
    "is located at @xmath5 .",
    "we recall that in a spherically symmetric background the equations of motion for the perturbations simplify to schrdinger type equations @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the tortoise coordinate or is related to it , @xmath8 is an effective potential that depends on the perturbation , and @xmath9 is related to the radial function of the perturbation . for the discussion that follows , in table [ tab : effective potentials ] we enumerate the effective potentials of several fields propagating in de sitter spacetime @xcite@xcite .",
    ".effective potentials in @xmath0-dimensional de sitter spacetime .",

    "( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) that satisfy :    \\(a ) they are purely outgoing near the de sitter horizon .",
    "\\(b ) they go to zero at @xmath14 .",
    "notice that the boundary condition at the origin ( b ) is slightly different from that of @xcite , @xcite . in those references",
    "it is imposed the boundary condition _",
    "`` the radial function is regular at @xmath14 '' _ , in particular the radial function can be equal to a constant different from zero .",
    "here we are imposing the boundary conditions ( a ) and ( b ) on the function @xmath9 that appears in the schrdinger type equation ( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) .    the motivation for the boundary conditions ( a ) and ( b ) is as follows .",
    "near the cosmological horizon @xmath15 the effective potentials of table [ tab : effective potentials ] behave as @xmath16 hence near the cosmological horizon the solution of eq .",
    "( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants . thus near the horizon",
    "the solution ( [ e : solution near the horizon ] ) represents ingoing and outgoing waves . for the de sitter qnm",
    "we must take the purely outgoing wave .",
    "near @xmath14 , almost all the effective potentials of table [ tab : effective potentials ] behave in the form ( see below for some exceptions ) @xmath20 and therefore for the potentials that satisfy this condition it is reasonable to impose the boundary condition @xmath21 .",
    "one exception to the behavior near @xmath14 given in the formula ( [ e : potential near zero ] ) is that of the effective potential @xmath22 for the dirac field with @xmath23 moving in four - dimensional de sitter spacetime , since in this example we get @xmath24 and for @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26 for the effective potential @xmath22 both limits ( [ e : limit zero v+ ] ) and ( [ e : limit zero v+ massless ] ) are finite at @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dirac vplus lambda 1 ] , for the massless dirac field with @xmath27 , we plot the effective potential @xmath22 in four - dimensional de sitter spacetime .",
    "we see that for these values of @xmath10 , @xmath28 , and @xmath0 the effective potential @xmath22 is negative and that near @xmath14 and @xmath5 its behavior is consistent with the analytical limits ( [ e : limit potential near horizon ] ) and ( [ e : limit zero v+ massless ] ) .     of the massless dirac field with @xmath27 . ]     of the klein gordon field with @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath31 ( continuous line ) . ]",
    "furthermore in four - dimensional de sitter spacetime , for the massive klein - gordon field with @xmath29 we find that its effective potential becomes ( see table [ tab : effective potentials ] ) @xmath32 and we point out that this potential is finite at @xmath14 .",
    "also for @xmath33 the effective potential ( [ e : effective potential klein gordon d4 ] ) is negative ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : klein gordon d 4 q 0 ] ) .",
    "as far as we have analyzed there is no another effective potential of table [ tab : effective potentials ] that behaves in this form for the allowed values of its physical parameters . )",
    "is similar to that for the same field propagating in two - dimensional de sitter spacetime @xcite .",
    "the difference is that the factor multiplying to @xmath34 is @xmath35 in four dimensions and @xmath36 in two dimensions .",
    "notice that in two - dimensional de sitter spacetime the effective potential of the massive klein - gordon field is always positive , in contrast to the behavior of the effective potential ( [ e : effective potential klein gordon d4 ] ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : klein gordon d 4 q 0 ] ) . ]    for the effective potentials that behave in this way we must discuss whether the boundary condition @xmath21 can be imposed , and we believe that for these examples we need a separate analysis . in what follows we do not analyze these potentials , because we like to show some results about the de sitter qnm that satisfy the boundary conditions ( a ) and ( b ) enumerated above .    establishing a bound on the imaginary parts of the qnf ,",
    "horowitz and hubeny prove that the qnm of the schwarzschild anti - de sitter black hole are stable @xcite .",
    "although the exact values of the de sitter qnf are known , and using these we can discuss the classical stability of the qnm , it is convenient to have an independent proof of their stability and prove it with a different method .",
    "hence we modify the method by horowitz and hubeny @xcite to show the classical stability of the de sitter qnm .    taking the time dependence as @xmath37 and following horowitz and hubeny",
    "we propose that the function @xmath9 of eq .",
    "( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) satisfies the de sitter qnm boundary condition near the horizon , that is , this function takes the form @xmath38 where the function @xmath39 is a solution of the differential equation @xmath40 and it behaves as @xmath41 and near the horizon @xmath39 goes to a constant .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we multiply eq .",
    "( [ e : equation phi ] ) by the complex conjugate of @xmath39 . denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath39 . ] integrating the result we obtain @xmath42= 0 .\\ ] ] next we integrate by parts the first term of the expression ( [ e : first integration phi ] ) and observe that the surface terms vanish .",
    "thus we get that the previous formula becomes @xmath43 = 0 .\\ ] ] we take the imaginary part of the previous expression @xcite to get @xmath44 and from the formulas ( [ e : result first integration phi ] ) and ( [ e : imaginary part phi ] ) we find @xmath45 =   2 i \\omega \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\textrm{d}}r \\ , \\phi^ * \\frac{{\\textrm{d}}\\phi}{{\\textrm{d}}r } = - \\frac { \\left| \\omega \\right|^2   \\left| \\phi(1 ) \\right|^2 } { { { \\mathbb{i}}{\\mathrm{m}}}(\\omega ) } .\\ ] ]    hence if @xmath46 then @xmath47 and the de sitter qnm are stable .",
    "thus for the fields of table [ tab : effective potentials ] we study whether their effective potentials are nonnegative to prove the classical stability of their de sitter qnm . for the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations it is possible to show that for the allowed values of the parameters , their effective potentials are always positive ( see table [ tab : effective potentials ] ) .",
    "thus for the gravitational and electromagnetic fields we assert that their de sitter qnm are stable .    for the klein - gordon and dirac fields propagating in de sitter spacetime their effective potentials are not strictly positive .",
    "for example , for the massless klein - gordon field with @xmath29 , when @xmath48 , if @xmath49 then @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , for the massless dirac field , if @xmath51 , @xmath52 then @xmath53 . and @xmath33 , we find @xmath50 in @xmath54 ( see fig .  [",

    "these results are valid for the de sitter spacetime .",
    "it is convenient to notice that for the klein - gordon , dirac , electromagnetic , and gravitational perturbations our results on the classical stability of their de sitter qnm are valid for @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , it is known that for asymptotically de sitter spherically symmetric black holes , their classical stability depends on the spacetime dimension in a non trivial way @xcite-@xcite . for example , only for @xmath77 we know analytical proofs of the classical stability of the @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild de sitter spacetime @xcite , @xcite . for @xmath78 there are numerical calculations that state their classical stability @xcite .",
    "we do not know analytical or numerical calculations determining the classical stability of schwarzschild de sitter black holes for @xmath79 .",
