    "the purpose of this letter is to describe a method for improving a renormalisation group improved perturbative calculation .",
    "we will study a two dimensional quantum field theory off criticality .",
    "in the two scaling limits , the infrared ( ir ) and the ultraviolet ( uv ) , it becomes a conformal field theory characterised by the virasoro central charge .",
    "the field theory we look at has the minimal models @xmath0 as scaling limits .",
    "our approximation method obtains a value for the infrared central charge @xmath1 using perturbative information around the ultraviolet limit of the theory . in @xcite @xmath1",
    "was calculated in perturbation theory in the limit when @xmath2 .",
    "this is valid because then the uv and ir fixed - points are arbitrarily close in the coupling constant space .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) eigenvalue @xmath3 of the perturbation vanishes as @xmath2 and the perturbation thus becomes marginal , and hence the field theory does not move away from the uv fixed - point . as well as for large values of @xmath4",
    "our approximation also applies for small values , @xmath5 , and we can test it against the exact result @xmath6 when @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath8",
    "we obtain the perturbative result reported in @xcite .",
    "to improve upon standard perturbative techniques requires some additional input . for this we will exploit the analyticity of the energy - momentum correlator @xmath9 in a complex scale parameter using it to construct a dispersion relation . in section 2",
    "we describe this dispersion relation .",
    "section 3 gives the results from perturbative cft and the rg improvements , and in section 4 we illustrate our approximation with numerical results .",
    "we will now construct a dispersion relation that relates the infra - red and ultra - violet behaviour of the energy - momentum tensor two - point function .",
    "the correlator of two energy - momentum tensors can be written using the kllen - lehman spectral representation @xcite as @xmath10 where we use the usual complex variables @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the spectral density of the qft which represents the density in degrees of freedom at the mass @xmath13 . integrating over @xmath14 gives @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "in @xcite it was shown using the spectral representation that @xmath18 and @xmath19 . from the properties of the modified bessel functions it then follows from that @xmath20 has the limits @xmath21 in @xcite we prove in detail that the expression provides an analytic continuation from real positive values of @xmath22 to the complex plane cut along the negative real axis , as might be expected from the analyticity of the bessel functions themselves . from now on we take @xmath22 to be in the complex plane with a thin wedge about the negative real axis removed ( so @xmath23 ) . from it also follows that @xmath20 has the limits for all @xmath24 and @xmath25 from the cut complex plane , so @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    the following contour integral in the cut complex plane therefore vanishes by analyticity of @xmath20 @xmath28 where the contour @xmath29 is given in figure 1 .",
    "the contribution from the large circle @xmath30 , where @xmath31 for @xmath32 $ ] , picks out the value @xmath33 in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "this is seen by writing the integral as an angular integral over @xmath35 , the limit @xmath36 can then be taken before the integral as it follows from that the integrand is bounded by a constant in the cut plane .",
    "for @xmath37 small the infrared central charge can thus be calculated from an integral over the small circle @xmath38 and an integral over the contour @xmath39 which we denote cut@xmath40 @xmath41 the exponential factor in the integrand suppresses the contribution of the cut for large positive values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 so that @xmath44 . to show this we divide the @xmath45 interval into @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 $ ] and note that @xmath20 is finite in the unit disk hence the contribution in the lower region is bounded by the function @xmath48 for some @xmath49 . in the other region , using the properties of the bessel functions , the integral is seen to be bounded by the expression @xmath50 which is uniformly convergent in @xmath42 , the details are shown in @xcite .    for small @xmath22 , @xmath20 and hence @xmath51 are determined by the ultra - violet behaviour .",
    "close to the uv fixed - point we may describe this by perturbation theory with running coupling constant @xmath52 , vanishing as @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the perturbative approximation to the integral in by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is approximated to n - th order by the perturbative expression @xmath55 .",
    "if analyticity is not spoilt by the perturbative expansion ( as may be seen by inspection of the results in the next section ) then simply substituting @xmath56 for @xmath57 in this limit would yield @xmath58 , which is just the perturbative estimate of the central charge , @xmath59 .",
    "since the scale dependence of the theory can be absorbed in the scaling of the running coupling constant @xmath52 we can write @xmath60 , so that if @xmath61 is the first non trivial zero of the perturbative @xmath62-function i.e.   @xmath63 for @xmath64 , then @xmath65 . however , we wish to improve on this result . both @xmath66 and @xmath67 equal @xmath68 . for small enough @xmath42",
    ", @xmath53 provides a good approximation to @xmath51 , since the power series expansion of @xmath51 is controlled by the small @xmath22 expansion of @xmath20 for which perturbation theory is good . for larger values of @xmath42 , @xmath51 and @xmath53 part company , tending to @xmath1 and @xmath59 respectively . if @xmath69 and if the region where @xmath53 is a good approximation to @xmath51 is large enough , then @xmath70 will have a maximum before approaching its limiting value of @xmath71 .",
    "it is this maximum that we will use to provide a better estimate of @xmath72 , since this occurs at the largest value of @xmath42 for which @xmath53 is a reasonable approximation to @xmath51 and the true value of @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 . as we will see",
    "this is the case for the minimal models considered in the next section .",
    "in the cft @xmath0 the primary field @xmath74 is a relevant field which rg trajectory is a geodesic in the coupling constant space @xcite .",
    "the qft @xmath75 therefore interpolates between the uv fixed - point ( @xmath76 ) given by @xmath77 and the ir fixed - point which is given by the cft @xmath78 .",
    "this can be seen from perturbative arguments in the @xmath2 limit @xcite and the general case is argued for in @xcite using thermo - dynamical bethe ansatz methods .",
    "when @xmath79 is small we can use perturbation theory to calculate quantities in the theory . calling the bare field @xmath80",
    "one gets @xcite to order @xmath79 @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the operator product expansion coefficient @xmath84 which can be calculated in the coulomb gas representation of minimal models using the formulas in @xcite .",
    "@xmath83 is given by @xmath85 @xmath3 is the rg eigenvalue for the perturbation @xmath74 . with the renormalisation conditions @xmath86",
    ", the renormalised correlator and @xmath62-function , @xmath87 , becomes to the same order @xcite @xmath88 here @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the renormalised coupling and field .",
    "the rg fixed - points , the zeros of the @xmath91function , are thus @xmath92 , @xmath93 and therefore @xmath94 as the theory lies between the two scaling limits .",
    "the trace of the energy - momentum operator @xmath95 is the infinitesimal generator for scale transformations and it is given by @xcite @xmath96 .",
    "then it follows from the ward identities that @xmath97 writing @xmath98 in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath99 , then becomes @xmath100 the limiting values of @xmath101 are given by , using these the solution to becomes @xmath102 the function @xmath20 is determined as @xmath103 .",
    "the theory is thus fixed at the renormalisation point and all scale dependence is moved into the running coupling constant @xcite @xmath104 we thereby get our 1 loop rg improved approximation of @xmath20 @xmath105 to apply our approximation based on the dispersion relation of the previous section to calculate @xmath106 we now have to find the maximum of @xmath107",
    "we first note that @xmath108 has the correct value in the perturbative limit @xmath109 . from it",
    "follows that @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 and the exact value is @xmath112 to calculate @xmath113 for finite @xmath4 we have to calculate @xmath114 .",
    "the running coupling can be rewritten as @xmath115 a variable change @xmath116 in @xmath114 then leads to @xmath117 where now all dependence of the renormalised coupling @xmath89 is moved into @xmath118 and the radius of @xmath119 : @xmath120 as now @xmath121 .",
    "the integral @xmath122 can be calculated numerically and in figure 2 we have plotted it against @xmath123 for the case of @xmath124 . for large @xmath125",
    "it tends to the perturbative value @xmath126 , but has a maximum value of @xmath127 which provides a better approximation to the true value of @xmath128 .",
    "the dashed line indicates how we expect @xmath129 to behave .",
    "we have approximated @xmath113 for different values of @xmath4 by the maximum of @xmath122 and we denote this approximation as @xmath130 .",
    "the numbers @xmath130 have been obtained by a numerical integration using a nag mark 18 fortran library quadrature routine . in figure 3 the error in @xmath130 and @xmath131 compared with @xmath132",
    "is plotted against @xmath4 .",
    "the errors are scaled with @xmath133 so that all points are distinguishable on the same plot .",
    "the figure shows that the error in the approximation @xmath130 is more than a factor 2 smaller than the error in the perturbative value @xmath131 in the region plotted .    for values of @xmath4",
    "smaller than @xmath134 perturbation theory begins to breakdown indicated by the rg improved result turning negative ( violating unitarity ) .",
    "our approximation whilst still positive for @xmath4 close to @xmath135 also becomes poorer since it is based on the rg expression .",
    "also , note that both @xmath130 and @xmath131 approaches @xmath132 faster than the asymptotic value @xmath136 in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "we have described an approximation method to obtain the ir central charge of the minimal models valid for @xmath137 .",
    "the method improves upon the rg improved calculation by exploiting the analyticity of the correlator of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this analyticity is a property both of the exact correlator and the rg improved perturbative estimate of it , @xcite , which we have used in our calculation .",
    "our approximation is correct in the perturbative limit @xmath8 . for smaller @xmath4 we obtained the values shown in figure 3 together with",
    "the rg improved perturbative result .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the approximation is significantly better than the rg improved perturbative result , e.g.  for @xmath138 it has a 7.8% relative deviation from the exact result whereas the rg perturbative result deviates by 18.0% .",
    "the analyticity in the complex scale parameter @xmath22 of the energy - momentum tensor two - point function is in fact an ubiquitous property of correlation functions in quantum field theory , having its origin in the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently we expect our approach to be applicable beyond the specific calculation we have used to illustrate it here , to other rg improved perturbative calculations of green s functions .",
