    "as is well known , in the light quark system the non - perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) effect is important and not negligible . an effective approach to describe such effect can be made by introducing the coupling between the chiral fields and quarks , especially in studying the nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) interactions .",
    "a chiral @xmath0 quark model @xcite was proposed by generalizing the idea of the @xmath2 @xmath3 model to the flavor @xmath0 case . in the original chiral @xmath0 quark model , the nonet pseuo - scalar meson exchanges and the nonet scalar meson exchanges",
    "are considered in describing the medium and long range parts of the interactions , and the one gluon exchange ( oge ) potential is still retained to contribute the short range repulsion . by using this model , the energies of the baryon ground states , the n - n scattering phase shifts and the hyperon - nucleon ( y - n ) cross sections can be reproduced reasonably .",
    "it seems that the repulsive core of the n - n interaction can be explained by the oge and the quark exchange effect .    since last few years",
    ", shen et al @xcite , riska and glozman @xcite applied the quark - chiral field coupling model to study the baryon structure .",
    "they found that the chiral field coupling is also important in explaining the structure of baryons .",
    "especially , the @xmath4 field coupling leads to increase the weight of d wave components in n and @xmath5 , and improve the mass of the roper resonance . in the work of riska",
    "et al @xcite , the vector meson coupling was also included to replace oge .",
    "they pointed out the spin - flavor interaction is important in explaining the energy of the roper resonance and got a comparatively good fit to the baryon spectra . despite the fact that this model can not explain the decay properties of the baryon excited states in the framework of three valance quark model space",
    ", it is still a big challenge to the isgur s model @xcite , in which the oge governs the baryon structure .    on the other hand , in the study of baryon - baryon ( b - b ) interactions on quark level , the short range repulsive feature of n - n interaction can be explained by oge interaction and quark exchange effect @xcite , but in the traditional one boson exchange ( obe ) model on baryon level @xcite the n - n short range repulsion comes from vector meson ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) exchanges .",
    "some authors @xcite also studied short - range nn repulsion as stemming from the goldstone boson ( and rho - like ) exchanges on the quark level .",
    "it has been shown that these interactions can substitute traditional oge mechanism .",
    "but whether oge or vector meson exchange is the right mechanism for describing the short range part of the strong interactions , or both of them are important , is still a challenging problem . to study this interesting problem , we extend our chiral @xmath0 quark model @xcite to involve vector meson exchanges . as we did before in the chiral @xmath0 quark model",
    ", first we fit the masses of baryon ground states , then the n - n phase shifts are calculated by solving a resonating group method ( rgm ) equation to see the effect of vector meson exchanges .",
    "the results show that the @xmath1 phase shifts of one channel calculation are obviously improved in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework of the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model is introduced in section 2 .",
    "the n - n phase shifts of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 partial waves are shown and discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally a conclusion is made in section 4 .",
    "in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , besides the nonet pseudo - scalar meson fields and the nonet scalar meson fields , the couplings among vector meson fields with quarks is also considered . with this generalization , in the interaction lagrangian a term of coupling between quark and vector meson field is included , @xmath12 thus the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath13 and @xmath14 where  @xmath15 is the kinetic energy of the system , and @xmath16 includes all the interactions between two quarks , @xmath17 is the confinement potential taken as the quadratic form , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the one gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction , @xmath20 with @xmath21 @xmath22 represents the interactions from chiral field couplings . in the extended chiral",
    "@xmath0 quark model @xmath22 includes scalar meson exchange @xmath23 , pseudo - scalar meson exchange @xmath24 , and vector meson exchange @xmath25 potentials , @xmath26 their expressions are @xmath27 @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31    @xmath32    and @xmath33 is a mass scale , taken as proton mass .    in the calculation ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons are mixed by @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the mixing angle @xmath38 is taken to be the usual value with @xmath39 . @xmath40 and @xmath7 mesons consist of @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , i.e. they are mixed by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , with the mixing angle @xmath45 .",
    "the coupling constant for scalar and pseudo - scalar chiral field coupling , @xmath46 , is determined according to the relation @xmath47 where @xmath48   is taken from the experimental value .",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the coupling constants for vector coupling and tensor coupling of the vector meson field respectively . in the study of nucleon resonance transition coupling to vector meson ,",
    "riska et al @xcite  took  @xmath51 and neglected the tensor coupling part . from the one boson exchange theory on baryon level",
    ", we can also obtain these two values according to the @xmath0 relation between quark and baryon levels .",
    "for example , @xmath52 in the nijmegen model d , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . from eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , we get @xmath55 and @xmath56 . such information is useful for adjusting the coupling constants of vector meson exchanges on quark level .",
    "all meson masses , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , are taken to be the experimental values , except the mass of @xmath3 meson , @xmath60 . according to the dynamical vacuum spontaneous breaking mechanism ,",
    "its value should satisfy @xcite @xmath61 this means that it can be regarded as almost reasonable when the value of @xmath60 is located in the range of around @xmath62 mev . in our calculation , we treat it as an adjustable parameter by fitting the binding energy of deuteron and in most other cases within this reasonable range .",
    "the cut - off mass , @xmath63 , indicating the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xcite is taken to be @xmath64 .",
    "once the parameters of chiral field are fixed , the coupling constant of oge @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the strength of confinement potential @xmath67 can be determined by fitting the baryon masses and by their stability conditions .",
    "all the parameters used are listed in table 1 . here",
    "we should mention that there are only one coupling constant for vector coupling of vector meson @xmath49 and one for tensor coupling @xmath50 in our model .",
    "the number of adjustable parameters are largely reduced in comparison to the one boson exchange theory on baryon level , in which different coupling constants were adopted for @xmath68 , @xmath40 , and @xmath7 exchanges .",
    "equipped with the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model with all the parameters determined , two baryon systems on dynamical quark level will be studied by solving the rgm equation with the hamiltonian given by eqs.(2)-(19 ) .    in the rgm calculation ,",
    "the trial wave function is taken to be @xmath69 with @xmath70 where a and b describe two clusters , and @xmath7 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 represent internal , relative , and center of mass motion wave functions , respectively , @xmath73 is the generator coordinate , and @xmath74 is the anti - symmetrization operator @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the permutation operator of the @xmath77-th and @xmath78-th quarks .",
    "the partial wave phase shifts of @xmath79-@xmath79 scattering are studied , and the results will be shown in the next section .",
    "we calculated the n - n phase shifts of different partial @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 , and @xmath80 waves using the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model .",
    "the results of the phase shifts are shown in figs.1 - 4 .",
    "the corresponding deuteron binding energies @xmath81 are listed in table 1 . for comparison with results from different models ,",
    "the results of chiral @xmath0 quark model without vector meson exchanges @xcite are drawn with short - dashed curves , while long dashed and solid curves are those obtained from the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model with two different sets of parameters . in the case of set i , the tensor coupling of the vector meson exchanges is not considered , namely @xmath82 , while the tensor coupling of vector meson exchanges is included in the case of set ii , where @xmath83 .",
    "as mentioned before , we adjust the mass of @xmath3 meson @xmath60 to fit the binding energy of deuteron . from table 1",
    ", one can see that @xmath60 is almost located in the reasonable range @xmath84 mev for all these three cases when the binding energy of deuteron @xmath81 is fitted .",
    ".model parameters and the corresponding binding energies of deuteron .",
    "the meson masses and the cut - off mass @xmath63 are @xmath85 and @xmath86 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table 1 and figs.1 - 4 , some interesting results are shown : ( 1 ) the one channel calculation of @xmath1 phase shifts is improved in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model in comparison to that obtained from chiral @xmath0 quark model , especially in the case of set ii , in which the tensor coupling of the vector meson exchange is considered though @xmath83 is not so large as that in the nijmegen model d. originally in the chiral @xmath0 quark model , we need to consider @xmath87 and @xmath88 channel coupling to get reasonable @xmath1 phase shifts @xcite . in that case , since the non - diagonal matrix elements between these two channels offered by pion tensor interactions are quite large , the coupling effect becomes very important . in this work",
    ", we also performed coupled channel calculation for @xmath1 state .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "5a-5c , in which dashed curve represents the one channel calculation results , and solid curves are those with @xmath87 and @xmath88 channel coupling .",
    "fig.5a is the result of the chiral @xmath0 quark model .",
    "it shows that the coupled channel effect is quite important in the chiral @xmath0 quark model@xcite",
    ". figs . 5b and 5c are results of the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model with parameters of set i and set ii . in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model ,",
    "since the tensor parts of vector mesons ( @xmath89 and @xmath40 ) have opposite sign to that of pion in the @xmath90 case , the non - diagonal matrix elements between @xmath87 and @xmath88 channels can be reduced due to the vector meson contribution , so that the coupled channel effect becomes smaller .",
    "but for all these three cases , the @xmath1 phase shifts of the coupled channel calculation are a little bit higher than the corresponding experimental values .",
    "( 2 )   the @xmath91 phase shifts of different models are almost the same , and all of them are in good agreement with experimental data . to get the right trend of the phase shift versus scattering energy , the size parameter @xmath92",
    "is taken with different values for these two models .",
    "@xmath93 in the chiral @xmath0 quark model , and @xmath94 in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model .",
    "this means that the bare radius of baryon becomes smaller when more meson clouds are included in the model .",
    "this physical picture looks reasonable .",
    "( 3 )  when the vector meson field coupling is considered , the coupling constant of oge is greatly reduced by fitting the mass difference between @xmath5 and @xmath79 . for both set i and ii , @xmath95 , which is much smaller than the value @xmath96 of chiral @xmath0 quark model ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it means that the oge interaction is rather weak in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model . instead",
    ", the vector meson exchanges play an important role for the short range interaction between two quarks .",
    "hence , mechanisms of the quark - quark short range interactions of these two models are totally different . in the chiral @xmath0 quark model ,",
    "the short range interaction is dominantly from oge , and in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , it is from combined effect of ps- and vector meson exchanges .",
    "( 4 )  to see the contributions from different meson exchanges in the n - n interactions in our extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , we print out the diagonal generator coordinating method ( gcm ) matrix elements for @xmath4 , @xmath89 and @xmath40 mesons respectively . as an example , fig .",
    "6 gives the potentials of @xmath4 , @xmath89 and @xmath40 mesons for the @xmath1 state ( for set i ) .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath89 and @xmath40 meson exchange potentials are drawn with solid , long - dashed and short - dashed curves , respectively .",
    "one can see that the @xmath40 meson exchange offers repulsion not only in the short range region , but also in medium range part .",
    "this property is different from that of @xmath4 meson , which only contributes repulsive core .",
    "( 5 )  as for the coupling constants of the vector meson exchange @xmath49 and @xmath50 , when we take @xmath82 , we get @xmath97 , which is a little bit smaller than the value used by riska et al @xcite , but slightly larger than the value obtained from the @xmath98 coupling constant of nijmegen model d @xcite .",
    "when @xmath83 , we get @xmath99 ( see table 1 ) , which is very closed to the value obtained from the nijmegen model d , but @xmath100 are much smaller than that from nijmegen model d. the results indicate that the coupling constant of vector meson exchange on quark level is much weaker than the corresponding coupling constant on baryon level . since on the quark level the size effect and the quark exchanges between two nucleon clusters also contribute short range repulsion , the smaller coupling constant of vector meson exchange on quark level can easily be understood . from the phase shift calculations",
    ", one can also see that the results are not very sensitive to @xmath100 . for both case",
    "i and ii , the calculated phase shifts are almost consistent with the experimental data . when @xmath83 , it is slightly helpful to increase the one channel @xmath1 phase shifts .",
    "it seems that on quark level the tensor coupling part of the vector meson exchanges is not very important in explaining the @xmath8 wave phase shifts .",
    "but for the @xmath101,@xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 partial waves , the calculated results are still not good enough , because in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , there is only one coupling constant @xmath49 for the vector coupling of the vector meson exchanges , and one coupling constant @xmath50 for the tensor coupling part . in the one boson exchange model on baryon level , such as nijmegen model , and the work on quark level @xcite , however , the coupling constants of @xmath89 and @xmath40 mesons are taken to be quite different . especially , the tensor coupling constant @xmath40 , @xmath105 are quite large @xcite .",
    "if we take different @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath89 and @xmath40 exchanges , possibly the results of @xmath101,@xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 partial waves can be improved .",
    "the vector meson exchange effect in n - n scattering processes on quark level is studied in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model .",
    "the differences between the chiral @xmath0 quark model and the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model are discussed in detail .",
    "it is found that in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , the phase shifts of @xmath1 and @xmath91 waves can be fitted rather well .",
    "all other partial waves calculated are also consistent with the experimental results . in the extended chiral @xmath0 quark model , the strength of oge interaction is greatly reduced and the short range nn repulsion is due to combined effect of ps- and vector meson exchanges , which also results in smaller size parameter @xmath92 .",
    "the tensor coupling constant of the vector meson exchange @xmath50 also becomes smaller than that on baryon level .",
    "all of these features shown above are reasonable and helpful in better understanding the short range mechanism of the quark - quark interactions .",
