    ", it has been proposed @xcite that we may be at the center of a inhomogeneous isotropic universe described by a lemaitre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution of einstein s fields equations , where spatial averaging over one expanding and one contracting region is producing a positive averaged acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "another more general approach to map luminosity distance as a function of redshift @xmath1 to ltb models has been recently proposed @xcite , showing that an inversion method can be applied successfully to reproduce the observed @xmath1 .",
    "the main point is that the luminosity distance is in general sensitive to the geometry of the space through which photons are propagating along light geodesics , and therefore arranging appropriately the geometry of a given cosmological model it is possible to reproduce a given @xmath1 . for frw models this",
    "correspond to set constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 and for ltb models it allows to determine the functions @xmath6 .",
    "the averaged acceleration @xmath0 on the other side is not directly related to @xmath2 , since this is obtained integrating the position dependent cosmological redshift along the light geodesics , while @xmath0 is the result of spatial averaging , and has no relation to the causal structure of the underlying space .",
    "this crucial difference can make @xmath0 unobservable to a central observer @xmath7 when the scale of the spatial averaging is greater than its event horizon .",
    "lemaitre - tolman - bondi solution can be written as @xcite as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a function of the time coordinate @xmath10 and the radial coordinate @xmath11 , @xmath12 is an arbitrary function of @xmath11 , and @xmath13 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath11 .",

    "the time dependence of @xmath44 corresponds to the choice of initial conditions for the light geodesics used to compute the luminosity distance .    solving the equation    @xmath45    for the model corresponding to the second row of table",
    "i we obtain @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the upper limit of the volume averaging integral . in this context @xmath48",

    "[ fig : m2rrr ] at @xmath49 there is a singularity along the geodesic , corresponding to the fact that light can not reach the central observer at time @xmath40 from points at radial coordinate @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath39 is a decreasing function of r , photons emitted at @xmath50 will arrive at @xmath49 at time @xmath51 when a local singularity develops because @xmath52 since regions of the universe at radial coordinates greater than @xmath48 have never been in causal contact with @xmath7 at time @xmath40 , the scale at which @xmath32 is defined is beyond the region causally connected to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore @xmath32 can not be detected from local observation of the luminosity distance which is used to define @xmath2 .",
    "this result is not surprising since the spatial averaging procedure is insensitive to the causal structure of the underlying space .",
    "the other models studied in @xcite do not show this causal behavior , but solving the geodesic equations and computing the luminosity distance using the same initial conditions adopted above it can be shown that they do not reproduce correctly the observed luminosity distance , but this goes beyond the scope of the present article , which is the study of the local observability of the averaged acceleration .",
    "we will study the luminosity distance of these and other ltb models with positive @xmath0 , and the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath53 in another work .     and",

    "is so small that it can not be distinguished from the horizontal zero axis . ]",
    "this example shows how @xmath0 may not even be causally related to the local observation of @xmath1 , and gives a reverse example of the results obtained in @xcite , where it was studied a ltb model fitting the observed luminosity distance , consistent with a positive @xmath2 , but without positive averaged acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "our results do not rule out ltb models as alternatives to dark energy since , since the inversion method @xcite allows to obtain the observed luminosity distance without any averaging , and some concrete examples derived independently have already been proposed @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that the luminosity distance @xmath1 contains more information than the spatially averaged acceleration @xmath0 because the first is sensitive to the causal structure of the entire space - time while the second is the result of averaging only the spatial part of the geometry , making the relation between them in general not one - to - one .",
    "our results confirm the general argument @xcite that the spatial averaging must be performed on comoving domains whose size coincides with the length scale at which homogeneity sets in , and not on domains which may be as large as or larger than the observable universe .",
    "it is possible that writing the geodesics equation in a form consistent with the buchert averaged formalism could overcome the problem , but this would be just a formal solution , since light is propagating along the geodesics of the inhomogeneous space , not of the averaged one .",
    "we showed that ltb models with positive averaged acceleration can require averaging on scales beyond the event horizon of the central observer . in these cases",
    "@xmath0 is causally unrelated to @xmath2 which is obtained from the observed luminosity distance , showing that a positive averaged acceleration @xmath0 in ltb models is in general not equivalent to a positive @xmath2 .",
    "this example shows how the averaging buchert @xcite formalism is not preserving the causal structure of space - time and can lead to the definition of locally unobservable averaged quantities .",
    "the study of the constraints on the local observability of averaged quantities will be addressed in a more general way , not only in the context of ltb models , in a future work .",
