    ", we instead get the result that the basis arising from this klr categorification has a positive expression in terms of any pbw basis .",
    "our description of the cuspidal representations necessary to kickstart this process is perhaps best described as non - constructive , though an analysis of the proofs show that it is also possible to obtain them via an inductive process .",
    "unfortunately we do not have reflection functors categorifying lusztig s automorphisms @xmath1 for representations of klr algebras outside of types ade in characteristic zero , where they were recently introduced by kato @xcite using geometric techniques .",
    "possible future access to reflection functors should provide a more direct approach towards constructing the cuspidal representations .",
    "the various classifications that arise for each choice of convex ordering are related to each other via the combinatorics of mirkovic - vilonen polytopes .",
    "we will not discuss this connection in this paper - this theory is developed in the paper of tingley and webster @xcite .",
