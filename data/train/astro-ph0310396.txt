    "to date , nearly all complete active galactic nuclei ( agn ) samples are flux limited at blue optical wavelengths .",
    "such surveys are highly efficient , and can be very complete ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , picking up all agns _ down to their blue flux limit_. unfortunately , any survey with a blue flux limit will be relatively insensitive to objects whose emission peaks at any other wavelength .",
    "how seriously does this blue flux limit bias agn samples ?",
    "the situation is somewhat different for qso searches ( searches for agns which are considerably brighter than their host galaxy ) and seyfert galaxy searches ( searches for less luminous agns ) .",
    "there has long been speculation that there might exist a substantial population of luminous qsos with red colors in the optical / near - ir .",
    "these red colors could be caused by small quantities of dust , or the qsos could be intrinsically red .",
    "given the steepness of the luminosity function for luminous qsos , most will lie close to the magnitude limit of a survey , so even small amounts of extinction will eliminate them from a blue - selected sample ( fig  [ dust ] ) .",
    "qsos live in the nuclei of galaxies , which are dusty places .",
    "it should therefore be no surprise that our sight - line to the centers of many qsos is obscured by dust .",
    "what is surprising is that the dust seems to either completely obscure our view of the central engine of the qso ( type-2 agn ) , or not to obscure it at all ( type-1 agn ) .",
    "there seem to be very few qsos that are partially obscured by dust , so that we still see a nuclear qso spectrum , albeit a reddened one .",
    "our sight - line seems either to intersects a giant molecular cloud or no dust at all .",
    "this contrasts with sight - lines from the earth out of our galaxy , most of which intersect small quantities of optically thin dust @xcite .",
    "is this a selection effect , or does agn activity expel or destroy optically thin dust , as suggested by @xcite ?    a few red qsos have now been found .",
    "many radio - selected quasars are quite red , though this redness may be caused by synchrotron emission or weak blue bump emission , rather than dust @xcite .",
    "at least a few radio - selected quasars , however , show unmistakable evidence of severe dust reddening @xcite .",
    "a handful of red agns have also been identified in other surveys ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to accurately determine the population of red qsos , and to better characterize their apparently diverse nature",
    ", a qso sample with a magnitude limit at some wavelength unaffected by dust would be ideal .",
    "radio surveys only pick up the small fraction of qsos that are radio - loud , which are probably not representative .",
    "hard x - ray surveys ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are unaffected by dust , but many hard x - ray sources are so faint at optical wavelength that follow - up spectroscopy is very difficult , even with large telescopes .",
    "it does , however , seem clear that dusty agns are a major contributer to the x - ray background .",
    "far - ir selection ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is biased _ towards _ dusty sources , but discriminating between qsos and starburst galaxies has proven extremely hard .",
    "complete near - ir selected surveys are still somewhat biased against dusty qsos ( fig  [ dust ] ) .",
    "they have the major advantage that most qsos found in a near - ir limited survey will be bright enough for relatively easy follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "surveys with @xmath12-band magnitude limits , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) qso survey @xcite , are an improvement on @xmath13-band limited surveys , but fig  [ dust ] makes it clear that going still further to the red should yield big gains .",
    "can we construct a complete @xmath14-band limited qso sample ?",
    "@xcite showed that by combining optical and near - ir photometry , it should be possible to construct such a sample .",
    "unfortunately , suitable photometry does not yet exist over larger areas of the sky , though the technique has been successfully applied in one small region @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for less luminous agns .",
    "these can not be found by color selection , as the host galaxy light dominates their broad - band colors .",
    "they are normally found by getting spectra of the nuclear regions of large samples of galaxies ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to date",
    ", these galaxy samples have been magnitude limited in the blue .",
    "this may well introduce a bias : the blue light from galaxies is dominated by young stars , and is hence an indication of recent star formation .",
    "the near - ir light from galaxies is coming from an older stellar population , and hence correlates with the total stellar mass rather than the recent star formation rate .",
    "near - ir selected galaxy samples are dominated by elliptical galaxies , unlike blue selected samples which are dominated by spirals .",
    "we might thus expect the population of agns in an ir - selected galaxy sample to differ from that in a blue - selected sample for many reasons .",
    "the black hole masses , which are known to correlate with the bulge stellar mass , should be larger .",
    "if accretion onto the black hole correlates with star formation , we might be looking at lower accretion rates .",
    "dust properties may be quite different , altering the ratios of obscured ( type-2 ) and unobscured ( type-1 ) agns .      by far the largest near - ir survey to date",
    "is the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "there have already been several studies of the different agn populations within 2mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that 2mass sources with extremely red near - ir colors ( @xmath15 ) are mostly an unusual type of type-1 agn @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 is a filter similar to @xmath14 but cutting off at a shorter red wavelength to minimize thermal emission @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied the 2mass colors of qsos identified at other wavelengths , and @xcite identified some very unusual and dusty qsos by cross - correlating the 2mass database with a radio sample . while these various papers clearly show that 2mass imaged large numbers of agns , none of them made any pretense at giving an unbiassed picture of the agn population within 2mass .    in this paper , we assemble a relatively unbiassed sample of 2mass agns .",
    "we use brute force : we apply only a very weak color selection , and then use multi - object spectroscopy to pick out the few agns from the large contamination of other objects .",
    "our only selection criteria were that an object had to be detected in all three 2mass bands , and that it had @xmath1 .",
    "this color cut was designed to eliminate halo giant and disk dwarf stars ( the peaks at @xmath17 , @xmath18 in fig  [ jkhist ] ) , but still be sensitive to most galaxies and qsos .",
    "nearly all qsos with redshifts below @xmath19 , selected at other wavelengths , have @xmath1 @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the near - ir flux excess @xcite is shifted out of the @xmath16-band , causing the average @xmath20 color of known agn to become bluer , but even at these higher redshifts , at least 10% of agn have @xmath1 .",
    "the color cut eliminates some galaxies from our sample .",
    "the median @xmath20 color of galaxies in the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) is @xmath21 . the mean color of galaxies shifts rapidly to the red with increasing redshift due to k - corrections , though . at the magnitude limit of the 2mass point source catalogue ( our input catalog ) ,",
    "most galaxies will be unresolved and will lie at redshifts well above 0.1 where the median galaxy color is redder than @xmath22 .",
    "we estimate our incompleteness to galaxies by counting the number of 2mass xsc sources with @xmath23 in our survey areas , and by cross - correlating the sloan digital sky survey early release galaxy catalog with the 2mass psc : fewer than 23% of galaxies would fail to meet our color cut .",
    "the missing galaxies will be predominantly at redshifts less than 0.1 and resolved by 2mass .",
    "the bias of our survey towards low redshift agn does limit our ability to find dusty qsos .",
    "the luminosity of most qsos found in the local universe is only a little greater than that of their host galaxies .",
    "even small amounts of dust extinction will thus reduce the agn light below the host galaxy light , causing the source to be classified as a type-2 agn rather than a dusty type - i agn .",
    "spectacularly reddened type-1 agn should thus only be found in high redshift , high luminosity samples , such as that of @xcite .",
    "our target selection , observations and data reduction are described in ",
    "[ obsred ] , and the spectral classification of our sources in ",
    "[ class ] .",
    "our results are presented in   [ results ] and discussed in   [ discuss ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in   [ conclude ]",
    "targets were selected from the 2mass point source catalog . note that this catalog includes extended sources .",
    "all cataloged sources with @xmath1 and detections in all three bands were potential targets , regardless of optical magnitude or morphology .",
    "no attempt was made to exclude previously observed sources .",
    "we observed spectra of sources in four fields .",
    "each field was circular , and one degree in radius .",
    "the fields were centered at 09:44@xmath2400:00 , 12:44@xmath2400:00 , 13:00@xmath2525:00 and 14:15@xmath2526:00 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the first two fields were chosen to overlap with the imaging data from the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "all fields lie at galactic latitudes greater than 30 degrees .",
    "observations were carried out with the two degree field ( 2df ) spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat , * ? ? ?",
    "this spectrograph has 400 fibers , spread over a circular field of radius one degree , located at the prime focus of the aat .",
    "each fiber has a projected diameter of 2   on the sky .",
    "a small number of fibers were set aside to measure the sky spectrum .",
    "the remaining fibers were allocated to targets using the _ configure _ program @xcite .",
    "the program was set to allocate fibers to the brightest @xmath16-band sources first , and then progressively to the fainter ones .",
    "we were able to allocate fibers to all 69 sources with @xmath26 , 677 of the 873 sources with @xmath27 , but only 780 of the 1407 sources with @xmath28 .",
    "the incompleteness in the @xmath27 range is mostly due to fiber positioning constraints , while the incompleteness at fainter magnitudes is due to the limited number of fibers .",
    "the incompleteness that this introduces should be random in every parameter except k - band magnitude .",
    "the magnitude and color distribution of the sources for which we obtained spectra are shown in fig  [ complete ] .",
    "spectra were taken of sources in our four fields on the nights of 2002 march 5  7 .",
    "conditions were partially cloudy at times , and the seeing was typically around 1.8 . each field was observed with two different fiber configurations : one for the brightest @xmath29 sources and the other for the remaining @xmath30 .",
    "this technique was chosen to minimize scattered light problems .",
    "exposure times were 600 - 900 sec for the bright object configurations , and 10,036  10,800 sec for the faint object configurations .",
    "bright sources in the 1415@xmath252600 field were not observed , due to cloud .",
    "the 300r and 316r gratings were used in the two spectrographs , giving a spectral resolution of 10  and a wavelength coverage of 4500 -  8500 .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ 2dfdr _ software @xcite , using standard settings .",
    "all galaxy spectra were averaged ( in the observed frame ) to provide a template atmospheric absorption spectrum .",
    "the individual spectra were divided through by this template , which did a reasonably good job of correcting for these absorption bands .",
    "the spectra are not of spectrophotometric quality .",
    "spectra were obtained for a total of 1526 sources .",
    "59 of these spectra were of such poor quality that regardless of the nature of the source , no spectral classification was possible .",
    "fig  [ complete ] shows that the unusable quality spectra are predominantly those of the brighter sources .",
    "this was mainly caused by poor weather : the bright objects in one of the four fields were never observed while in two other fields they were observed through significant cloud cover .",
    "observations of the fainter sources were not as badly affected .",
    "an initial classification was attempted for all spectra using the software developed for the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite .",
    "this software is optimized for measuring galaxy redshifts from 2df spectra of comparable quality to our own , and uses template fitting , line - fitting and cross - correlation techniques to classify spectra and to measure redshifts .",
    "all classifications were checked manually and assigned a quality flag .",
    "the program produced high quality classifications and ( where relevant ) redshifts for around 80% of our spectra .",
    "it showed excellent performance for galaxies in our sample , but was less reliable for broad - line agn and stars .",
    "the remaining spectra were checked by eye , and in many cases secure identifications could be made interactively .",

    "emission - line ratios were measured automatically for the remaining galaxies , by interpolating a straight - line continuum under them and summing the flux above this continuum .",
    "wavelength regions used to define the continuum and over which line fluxes were summed are shown in table  [ linewave ] .",
    "the effect of the underlying stellar absorption lines was corrected for by measuring the mean absorption - line equivalent width of the line - less galaxies in the sample , and adding this to the measured emission - line equivalent widths .",
    "this assumes that the underlying stellar continua of emission - line and non - emission - line galaxies are the same , which will only be true to first approximation .",
    "these corrections are small : 0.05 nm for h@xmath3 , 0.18 nm for h@xmath31 , 0.15 nm for [ , -0.07 nm for and 0.005 nm for . to check that these corrections did not significantly affect our results , we repeated our classification without making them .",
    "this did not alter the classification of any of our galaxies , principally because the most affected sources were seyfert-2 galaxies with very weak h@xmath31 emission , and these lie a long way from the selection boundary .",
    "all line measurements were checked by eye and awarded a quality flag : 6% of spectra were too poor at the relevant wavelength to obtain a good measurement of h@xmath3 .",
    "this was usually caused by h@xmath3 falling on a strong sky line or atmospheric absorption band .",
    "we estimate our equivalent width limit by looking at the dispersion in h@xmath3 equivalent width measurements in galaxies with no detectable line emission ( fig  [ hahist ] ) .",
    "we estimate that we are sensitive to all galaxies with rest - frame h@xmath3 equivalent widths of @xmath35 nm .",
    "this excludes the 6% of galaxy spectra which were too poor at the relevant wavelength .",
    "all galaxies with adequate quality data in all emission lines were classified using the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig  [ classplot ] .",
    "the galaxies split cleanly between agn and starbursts .",
    "the agn have the line ratios of seyfert - ii galaxies and not of liners .",
    "the 23 sources lying above both classification lines were classified as type ii agn , and the 34 lying below as starburst galaxies .",
    "one source lay above one line and below the other : we classified it as an unknown emission - line galaxy .    unfortunately , while many galaxies had good quality data for the lines near h@xmath3 ( and @xmath32@xmath33 $ ] ) , the shorter wavelength lines ( h@xmath31 and @xmath32@xmath33 $ ] ) were often too weak for us to be able to calculate their position along the y - axis of fig  [ classplot ] .",
    "we note , however , a reasonably strong correlation between the x- and y - axes in the classification plots .",
    "if this correlation holds for the galaxies with weaker short wavelength lines , we can use it to tentatively classify at least some of these sources .",

    "this yielded another 12 probable seyfert ii galaxies , and 65 probable starburst galaxies .",
    "all other galaxies with h@xmath3 equivalent widths greater than 0.4 nm were classified as unknown emission - line galaxies .",
    "we extracted data from the sdss early data release for the 739 of our targets lying within its region of coverage .",
    "for all but two of these sources , a sdss cataloged source was found within 1.6of the 2mass position .",
    "the median positional offset between the 2mass and sdss coordinates was 0.269 .",
    "two 2mass sources did not have sdss cataloged sources within 5of the 2mass position : 2mass 0943007@xmath25000955 ( an m - dwarf star ) and 2mass 0946501@xmath24002050 ( a galaxy at redshift 0.1414 ) .",
    "as we obtained good spectra of both sources , using the 2.0  diameter 2df fibers centered at the 2mass coordinates , the error must not lie in the 2mass catalog .",
    "all the 477 sources we classified as galaxies ( on the basis of their spectra ) were classified as extended sources by sdss , while 147/156 stars were classified as point sources .",
    "of the 68 sources with sdss data that we were unable to classify based on their spectra , 54 ( 80% ) were classified by sdss as extended sources .",
    "a visual inspection of their spectra confirms that most are probably galaxies without strong emission or absorption lines at wavelengths with good data .",
    "we obtained 1526 spectra , or which 1467 were of usable quality .",
    "we were able to obtain secure classifications for 1298 of these spectra ( 88% completeness ) .",

    "if any of these unclassified sources with usable quality spectra were agns with h@xmath3 equivalent widths of @xmath4 nm , we would have detected their emission lines .",

    "many of our sources , however , are fainter than the nominal completeness limit of the 2mass survey .",
    "we estimated this completeness limit for our fields by comparing our @xmath16-band galaxy counts against the compilation of @xcite .",
    "down to @xmath45 , our target list appear to be highly complete : the statistical error due to our small sample of agns is much greater than any error caused by sample incompleteness . at this limit , and correcting for the unobserved targets , we are finding @xmath8 type-1 agns per square degree .",
    "are we missing many agns with @xmath46 ?",
    "@xcite showed that essentially all low redshift ( @xmath47 ) agns discovered by other techniques have @xmath1 , and should hence have been found in our survey . at higher redshifts",
    ", however , most agns have bluer @xmath20 colors .",
    "this is probably a @xmath48-correction effect : most agn show a sharp rise in flux between rest - frame 1 and 2 microns , perhaps due to hot dust emission ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at redshifts above 0.5 , this is redshifted out of the k - band .",
    "only @xmath49% of high - z ( @xmath50 ) agns detected by other techniques have @xmath1 , except in the redshift range @xmath51 , in which the h@xmath3 emission line lies within the k - band .",
    "this is consistent with our redshift distribution ( fig  [ agn_zhist ] ) .",
    "another way to test our completeness is to see whether we recovered previously know agns in our fields .",
    "the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) lists 99 agns in our field , of which only nine meet our magnitude limits .",
    "only one of the nine has @xmath46 .",
    "we recovered six of the remaining nine objects : we did not put fibers on the other two sources .    we can therefore place a lower limit on the surface density of type-1 agn of @xmath8 per square degree , down to @xmath52 .",
    "this matches the surface density of optically selected agns down to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "given that a typical quasar has @xmath54 @xcite , this suggests that we may be seeing the same population sampled by optical surveys .",
    "this comparison should be treated with caution , however , as most optically selected qsos down to @xmath55 lie at redshifts to which we are largely insensitive , and most of our agn have such low luminosities that they would be discarded from most optical samples due to host galaxy contamination (   [ find ] ) .      as table  [ type1 ] shows , only 57% of the type-1 agns , and none of the type-2 agns had been previously identified as agns .",
    "all 5 type-1 agns with redshifts above 0.5 had been previously identified .    in fig  [ colourplot ]",
    ", we compare the optical colors of our agns with the colors of field stars and galaxies . only sources overlapping with the sdss early data release are shown .",
    "our agns are clearly separated from the stellar locus .",
    "half the type-1 agns are also well separated from the galactic locus , but the other half are not , and the type-2 agns also lie well within the galactic locus .",
    "this explains why so many of our sources were not previously identified : they are spatially resolved and have galaxy - like optical colors . adding near - ir photometry",
    "does nt help : their spectra energy distributions are indistinguishable from those of inactive galaxies all the way from the @xmath56 to the @xmath16 band .",
    "why do the colors of so many of our sources resemble galaxies ?",
    "the spectra of all agns with galaxy - like colors show strong stellar absorption lines , so their colors are probably dominated by the host galaxy , and not by nuclear emission .",
    "furthermore , fig  [ kmag ] shows that the @xmath16-band magnitudes of these agns are comparable to those of inactive galaxies at the same redshifts .",
    "we thus conclude that the host galaxy , rather than the nucleus , is dominating the observed continuum flux at all wavelengths .",
    "while these agns would not be identified as such on the basis of their broad - band colors , their strong broad h@xmath3 emission lines would make them detectable in objective prism surveys , and large galaxy redshift surveys should contain thousands of them .",
    "is there a large population of dusty red qsos ?",
    "we are unable to determine whether our low redshift agns are dust - reddened , as the host galaxies dominate their broad - band colors , and as our observations are not spectrophotometric , we can not determine the reddening by looking at line ratios .",
    "it is possible that their spectra are dominated by host galaxy light precisely because they are dusty .",
    "alternatively , their nuclei could be intrinsically less luminous , or their host galaxies intrinsically more luminous than those of optically selected agns with the same @xmath16-band luminosities .",
    "this leaves the small number of high redshift qsos .",
    "sdss colors are available for four of these sources .",
    "all four are quite blue : their mean @xmath57 color is 2.86 , which is very comparable to that seen in optically selected qso samples @xcite .",
    "none are more than 0.7 mag redder than the mean in @xmath58 , corresponding to @xmath59 ( for dust with an optical depth inversely proportional to wavelength ) .",
    "we thus see no evidence for a population of dusty red qsos .",
    "our sample is , however , too small to place strong constraints .",
    "let us define a red qso as one with @xmath60 , corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "the fact that none of the four high - z qsos with sdss data meet this definition allows us to say with 95% confidence that no more than 50% of qsos down to our magnitude limit are red . as shown in fig  [ dust",
    "] , however , imposing even a k - band magnitude limit will suppress the numbers of red agns by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "our limit is thus a weak one : no more than 80% of qsos can be red .",
    "this is quite consistent with the limits derived from radio surveys @xcite .",
    "what fraction of the galaxies in our sample contained active nuclei , and how does this compare to the fraction found in blue galaxy samples ?",
    "we are only sensitive to agns with h@xmath3 rest - frame equivalent widths of greater than 0.4 nm , within our aperture ( our fibers are 2 in diameter , which for the median redshift of the sample ( 0.15 ) corresponds to a physical diameter of 5kpc ) .",
    "@xcite showed that we will miss most agns at this equivalent width limit , with our large aperture .",
    "in particular , we are mainly sensitive to seyfert-2 galaxies and not to liners ( low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ) .",
    "we obtained 1467 usable spectra , of which 330 were stars .",
    "another 169 showed no significant emission or absorption features and are probably inactive galaxies .",
    "the remaining 968 are galaxies for which we were able to measure secure redshifts .",
    "6% of these galaxies had something wrong with their spectra at the wavelength of h@xmath3 .",
    "187 of the remaining galaxies had h@xmath3 equivalent widths of @xmath35 nm .",
    "of these , we were able to spectrally classify 116 .",
    "we identified 14 type-1 agns and 35 type-2 definite or probable agns .",
    "there are 71 galaxies with narrow h@xmath3 lines above our selection threshold but with the signal - to - noise ratio too poor to allow classification .",
    "if we assume that these galaxies have the same relative proportions of type-2 agns and starburst galaxies as the 116 we could classify , then there are 58 type-2 agns in the sample .    the sample population in which we could have seen type-2 agn activity is @xmath63 galaxies .",
    "we thus estimate that @xmath64% of galaxies in our sample were type-2 agns , down to our h@xmath3 equivalent width limit ( poisson errors ) . if none of the unclassifiable emission - line galaxies were agns , which seems unlikely , the fraction would be @xmath65% .",
    "this gives a lower limit on the fraction . for type-1 agns ,",
    "the fraction is @xmath7% .",
    "note also that our 35 definite or probable agns included several classified on the basis of their red emission lines only , as discussed in section  [ eline ] .",
    "how does this compare with the agn fraction in blue - selected galaxy samples ?",
    "@xcite only found seyfert activity ( of any type ) in 1.3% of a sample of 2399 nearby galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , they do not list their equivalent width threshold , so this number can not be compared to our figure .",
    "@xcite , however , find that nearly 50% of nearby blue - selected galaxies are agns , but they used nuclear spectra and were sensitive to much weaker lines than we are .",
    "we defined a sub - sample of the @xcite sources that would have been classified as seyfert galaxies by our criteria .",
    "firstly , we had to correct for the different spectroscopic aperture .",
    "they typically measured the spectrum over a region of radius @xmath66 pc , compared to our physical radii of @xmath67pc . to see how much difference",
    "this typically makes , we obtained archival ccd images of six seyfert-2 galaxies from their sample , using the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "we measured the broad - band optical flux for each galaxy in a 200pc aperture and a 2500pc aperture .",
    "the fluxes in the larger apertures were greater by a factor of between 4 and 25 .",
    "thus for one of their galaxies to have made it into our sample ( if it were at the median redshift of our galaxies ) , it would need a nuclear h@xmath3 equivalent width exceeding 1.6 nm ( @xmath68 nm ) .",
    "@xcite also use slightly different diagnostics to identify agn but this makes little difference to the final numbers .",
    "we find that @xmath69 of their galaxies contained type-2 agns ( meeting our selection criteria ) and @xmath70% contained type-1 agns .",
    "there is thus no significant difference in the fraction of type-1 agns , but we are finding a significantly higher fraction of type-2 agns .    why do we find a higher fraction of galaxies with agns ? finding an agn requires the presence of a black hole , a suitable accretion rate of mass on to it , gas to be ionized by the nucleus and a dust geometry that both allows this ionization to take place and allows us to see the resultant narrow line emission .",
    "many of these factors could be different in an ir - selected sample . as black hole masses are correlated with the stellar masses of the bulge ( eg",
    "* ) , this may indicate that our sample of galaxies contain larger nuclear black holes than those found in blue - selected samples .",
    "on the other hand , blue galaxies typically have more gas and a higher star formation rate than red ones .",
    "note also that our galaxies lie at higher redshifts than the @xcite sample , and are on average more massive and luminous .",
    "we may simply be looking at a tendency for agns to be found in the most massive galaxies .",
    "could the difference simply be because the near - ir selected galaxies have less continuum flux at the wavelength of h@xmath3 ?",
    "our galaxies have a median @xmath71 , while blue - selected galaxies at similar magnitude limits have a median @xmath72 .",
    "thus the younger stellar populations in the blue selected galaxies are increasing the continuum flux per unit stellar mass by a factor of @xmath73 . even allowing for this , the fraction of seyfert-2 galaxies in @xcite would only rise to @xmath73% .",
    "this result should be considered tentative .",
    "secure line diagnostics are only available for around half of the seyfert-2 population in our sample , and the comparison with the very different @xcite sample involves large corrections for the different agn detection thresholds .",
    "we have selected a small sample of agns in the near - ir , using the brute - force power of the 2df spectrograph to minimize selection biases .",
    "perhaps the most surprising thing about this sample is how similar it looks to conventional blue - selected agn samples .",
    "while many of our type-1 agn would not have been found by optical techniques , in all cases this seems to be due to host galaxy contamination .",
    "large galaxy surveys , such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , are probably the best way to find such agns .",
    "our sample of high redshift qsos was too small to usefully constrain the population of dusty red qsos .",
    "we tentatively conclude that the fraction of galaxies in our sample with agn emission is greater than that found in the blue selected galaxy sample of @xcite .",
    "there are many possible reasons for this difference and discriminating between them will be difficult .",
    "finally , we can extrapolate from our data to estimate the number of active galactic nuclei in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "there should be @xmath74 50,000 type-1 agns and @xmath74 200,000 type-2 agns that meet our selection criteria .",

    "<S> in contrast , the incidence of type-2 ( narrow - line ) agns in a near - ir selected galaxy sample seems to be higher than in a blue selected galaxy sample . </S>"
