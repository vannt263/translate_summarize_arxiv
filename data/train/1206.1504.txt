    "option pricing intends like many other financial techniques to tame as much as possible market risks . the black - scholes - merton ( bsm ) approach ( @xcite ) , which is forty years old ,",
    "is still by far the most popular setting , although some of its drawbacks and pitfalls were known shortly after its publication .",
    "it had an enormous impact on the huge development of modern quantitative finance .",
    "its heavy use of advanced mathematical tools , like stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations , explains to a large part the features of today s mathematical finance , which is enjoying a great popularity not only among academics but also among practitioners .",
    "many textbooks ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) provide an excellent overview of this lively and fascinating field .    let us add in the context of this conference that a growing number of references exploits the connections of the bsm setting with methods stemming from various engineering fields .",
    "we mention here :    * learning techniques ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , * control theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .    in 1997 , scholes and merton won the nobel prize in economics ",
    "black died in 1995  not for the discovery of the pricing formulas which were already known ( @xcite ) , but for the methods they introduced for deriving them .",
    "the most elegant concepts of _ replication _ and _ dynamic delta hedging _ , which are now central both in theory and practice , have nevertheless been the subject of severe criticisms for their lack of realism ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "dynamic delta hedging moreover can not be extended to more general stochastic processes exhibiting jumps for instance ( @xcite ) .",
    "pricing formulas are derived here via an elementary arbitrage principle which employs the expected return of the underlying and goes back at least to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "combined with the utilization of _ trends _",
    "( @xcite ) it permits to    1 .",
    "alleviate one of the most annoying paradoxes in modern approaches that concerns the uselessness of the expected return of the underlying ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , 2 .",
    "deal quite simply with more subtle behaviors of the underlying , which may exhibit jumps , by incorporating those behaviors in the trends , 3 .",
    "define a new more realistic dynamic hedging .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ cp ] summarizes and sometimes improves some facts already presented earlier ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "section [ arbi ] recalls how pricing formulas may be derived via an elementary arbitrage principle , _",
    "i.e. _ , without replication . section [ wt ] slightly modifies those formulas by taking trends into account . a new dynamic hedging , which employs both the pricing formulas and the trend of the underlying , is proposed in section [ dhed ] . due to an obvious lack of space , the convincing computer illustrations , which are displayed in section [ illu ] ,",
    "are limited to a quite violent behavior of the underlying .",
    "section [ conclu ] further analyzes the change of paradigm which might arise from this new setting .",
    "the theorem due to cartier and perrin @xcite is expressed in the language of _ nonstandard analysis_. it depends on a time sampling @xmath0 where the difference @xmath1 is _ infinitesimal _ , _ i.e. _ , `` very small '' .",
    "then , under a mild integrability condition , the price @xmath2 of the financial quantity may be decomposed ( @xcite ) in the following way @xmath3 where    * @xmath4 is the _ trend _ , or the _ mean _ , or the _ average _ , of @xmath5 ; * @xmath6 is a _ quickly fluctuating _ function around @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath8 is infinitesimal for any finite interval @xmath9 $ ] , * @xmath4 and @xmath6 are unique up to an additive infinitesimal quantity .",
    "@xmath10 , which is `` smoother '' than @xmath11 , provides a mathematical justification ( @xcite ) of the _ trends _ in _ technical analysis _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "[ trendagadir ] note that @xmath12 is analogous to `` noises '' in engineering according to the analysis of @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for the estimation of @xmath13 and of its derivatives . see @xcite , and",
    "the references therein , for convincing numerical experiments including forecasting results which are deduced from the trends .",
    "if @xmath4 is differentiable at @xmath14 , then its logarithmic derivative @xmath15 is called the _",
    "trend - return _ of @xmath5 at @xmath14 .",
    "see @xcite for other definitions of returns .",
    "take two integrable time series @xmath16 , @xmath17 , such that their squares and the squares of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are also integrable .",
    "it leads us to the following definitions , which are borrowed from @xcite :    1 .",
    "the _ covariance _ of two time series @xmath16 and @xmath20 is the time series @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the trend with respect to the time sampling @xmath0 .",
    "the _ variance _ of the time series @xmath23 is @xmath24 3 .",
    "the _ volatility _ of @xmath16 is the corresponding standard deviation @xmath25",
    "we limit ourselves for simplicity s sake to _",
    "european call options _ , which are options for the right to buy a stock or an index at a certain price at a certain maturity date .",
    "let @xmath26 be the risk - free rate .",
    "the expected price at maturity @xmath27 should be equal to @xmath28 a heuristic justification goes like this : assume , for simplicity s sake and like in today s academic literature , that    * @xmath26 is a constant @xmath29 , * @xmath11 follows a geometric brownian motion @xmath30\\ ] ] where * * @xmath31 is a standard brownian motion , * * @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant .",
    "providing a theoretical estimation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 from historical data is classic and straightforward .",
    "we thus know the mean @xmath34 of @xmath11 . if @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) , it might be profitable for the arbitrageur to borrow money ( resp . selling the underlying ) for buying the underlying @xmath5 ( resp . for investing the corresponding amount of money ) at time @xmath7 , and selling it ( resp .",
    "buying the underlying ) later , at time @xmath27 for instance .",
    "assume that    * the underlying follows the geometric brownian motion , * the expected final price satisfies the condition , _",
    "i.e. _ , is equal to @xmath37    krouglov @xcite shows , by exploiting properties of log - normal distributions , that the usual bsm formulas may be recovered .",
    "write down here the value of a european call option : @xmath38 where    * @xmath39 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 * @xmath41 is the strike price , * @xmath42 , * @xmath43 .",
    "assume again that the risk - free rate @xmath44 is a constant @xmath29 .",
    "a natural extension of section [ arbi ] states that the expected final price at maturity @xmath27 of the underlying is @xmath45 it means the following :    * @xmath46 replaces @xmath47 in order to avoid the quick fluctuations . *",
    "the trend @xmath48 is `` close '' around maturity @xmath27 to @xmath49 . *",
    "the trend @xmath48 is differentiable around @xmath27 and the corresponding trend - return @xmath50 of equation is `` close '' to @xmath29 .",
    "assume that the quick fluctuations around the trend may be described at a time @xmath14 around @xmath27 by a lognormal distribution of mean @xmath48 and variance @xmath33 .",
    "it yields , as in section [ arbi ] , the bsm - like formulas where the value of a european call option is given by @xmath51 when compared to equation , notice that @xmath11 is replaced by @xmath52 .",
    "if we suppose that the quick fluctuations may be properly described by a normal distribution , we would arrive at pricing formulas quite analogous to those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if we assume that we only forecast the volatility , then the choice of the corresponding normal distribution might be quite appropriate .",
    "let @xmath53 be the value of an elementary portfolio of one long option position @xmath54 and one short position in quantity @xmath55 of some underlying @xmath5 : @xmath56 note that @xmath55 is the control variable : the underlying is sold or bought .",
    "the portfolio is _ riskless _ if its value obeys the equation @xmath57 , where @xmath29 is the constant risk - free rate .",
    "it yields @xmath58 replace    * equation by @xmath59 where @xmath54 is computed at time @xmath14 via section [ tf ] . *",
    "equation by @xmath60    combining equations and leads to the tracking control strategy @xmath61 we might again call _ delta hedging _ this strategy , although it is only an approximate dynamic hedging via the utilization of trends and of the corresponding time sampling @xmath62 .    in order to implement correctly equation , the initial value @xmath63 of @xmath55 has to be known .",
    "if @xmath64 and @xmath54 are differentiable , this is achieved by equating the logarithmic derivatives at @xmath65 of the right handsides of equations and : @xmath66    our approach to dynamic hedging may be connected to _ model - free control _ ( @xcite ) which already found many concrete applications .",
    "remember that one of the main difficulty related to dynamic replication is the necessity to have a `` good '' probabilistic model of the behavior of the underlying .",
    "the underlying is the s&p 500 , which is one of the most commonly followed equity indices .",
    "the preliminary calculations below are necessary for our dynamic hedging in section [ dh ] .",
    "figure [ f1 ] displays the daily s&p 500 , from 3 january 2000 until 2 december 2012 . a turbulent 200 days period from 9",
    "may 2008 until 24 february 2009 is extracted in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the excellent quality of our trend estimation ( see remark [ trendagadir ] ) is highlighted by those two figures , especially when compared to a classic moving average techniques using the same number of points , here 30 .",
    "let us emphasize moreover that the unavoidable delay associated to any estimation technique is quite reduced thanks to our theoretical viewpoint .",
    "figure [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] display the corresponding logarithmic return @xmath67 where @xmath11 denotes the daily value of the s&p 500 and @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding annualized volatility is @xmath69 where , for determining the standard deviation @xmath70 ,    * a 10 days sliding window is used , * the mean may be deduced from equation .",
    "this type of calculations is much too sensitive to the return fluctuations .",
    "figure [ f6 ] exhibits this annoying feature as well as the results obtained via the two following procedures which are utilized in order to bypass this difficulty :    1 .   a classic low - pass filter permits to alleviate those fluctuations .",
    "the results for the on - line detection methods in @xcite of _ _ change - points _ _ are depicted in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the sensitivity of the algorithm , which may be easily modified , is adapted here to quite violent abrupt changes . if such a change is detected its effect is reduced via an averaging where the size of the sliding window is augmented .",
    "it corresponds to the _ time - scaled volatility _ in figures [ f6 ] , [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] .    the second method , which provides a most efficient smoothing when a change point is detected , seems to work better .",
    "introduce now the european call option during the hectic period of 200 days shown in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "write @xmath71 the maturity time .",
    "set @xmath72 for the risk - free rate .",
    "the strike price @xmath41 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 . at any time @xmath14 , @xmath75",
    ", computing the numerical value of the call , as shown in figure [ f7 ] , uses    * formula , * the estimated volatilities in section [ vola ] .",
    "thanks to the numerical results of section [ prelim ] , formula yields dynamic hedging performances which are reported in figure [ f8 ] .",
    "note that a proper choice of the volatility calculation ensures in the same time and in spite of an only rough replication    * small oscillations of the control variable @xmath55 , * a good hedging .",
    "if further studies confirm our viewpoint on option pricing and dynamic hedging , it will open radically different roads which should bypass some of the most important difficulties encountered with today s approaches .",
    "let us emphasize as above and once again ( @xcite ) that a consequence of our setting might the obsolescence of the need of complex stochastic processes for modeling the underlying s behavior .",
    "taking into account    * the trends , which carry the information about jumps and other `` violent '' behaviors , * their forecasting , * not only the variance around the trend but also the skewness and the kurtosis ,    should lead to new option pricing formulas , where the ( geometric ) brownian motion will loose its preeminence .",
