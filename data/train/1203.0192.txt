    "<S> we investigate numerically the transverse versus vortex phase diagram of head - to - head domain walls in co / cu / py spin valve nano - stripes  ( py : permalloy ) , in which the co layer is mostly single domain while the py layer hosts the domain wall . </S>",
    "<S> the range of stability of the transverse wall is shifted towards larger thickness compared to single py layers , due to a magnetostatic screening effect between the two layers . </S>",
    "<S> an approached analytical scaling law is derived , which reproduces faithfully the phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 in    0.5 in    the fundamental study of magnetic domain walls  ( dws ) has found a playground in lithographically - defined nano - stripes . in the range of widths from a few tens to a few hundreds of nanometers their complexity </S>",
    "<S> is dramatically reduced with respect to extended thin films , while still retaining a few internal degrees of freedom leaving a rich physics . for stripes with in - plane </S>",
    "<S> magnetization , head - to - head dws are of transverse  ( tw ) or vortex  ( vw ) typeb@xcite , and may be characterized by a chirality , asymmetry and/or polarity . </S>",
    "<S> their propagation under the stimulus of a magnetic field or a current of spin - polarized electrons is intrinsically precessional and reveals effects such as dw inertia@xcite and a so - called walker limit beyond which periodic dw transformations occur@xcite . due to their small size and fast dynamics , magnetic domain walls  ( dws ) </S>",
    "<S> are promising candidates in the area of information processing and storage@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most reports so far have considered dws in a single layer of magnetically - soft materials , such as permalloy  ( py ) or cofeb alloys . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic trilayers f1/nm / f2 ( with @xmath0 a ferromagnet , and nm a non - magnetic material ) also deserve attention as they play a key role in spintronics , especially in devices using giant magneto - resistance . these stacking are called spin valve for a metal spacer layer , and pseudo spin valve or magnetic tunnel junction for an insulator spacer layer . </S>",
    "<S> f1 is a soft layer in which the dw moves , while f2 is a reference layer that is supposed to remain uniformly magnetized . </S>",
    "<S> unusually - large current - driven dw mobilities with speed exceeding have been reported in such stacks@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tentative explanations point at either out - of - plane spin accumulation and torque@xcite , oersted field@xcite or magnetostatic coupling between the layers that may modify the statics or dynamics of the dw@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the role of magnetostatic coupling is well established in thin films with the formation of quasi - walls in the supposedly uniformly - magnetized layer@xcite , it has been scarcely addressed@xcite in stripes . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we determine the phase diagram of head - to - head dws in spin valves with in - plane magnetization ( tw versus vw ) , combining numerical simulation and analytical modeling . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we consider co / cu / py nano - stripes with various widths @xmath1 and thickness of the individual layers @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the dw is located in the py layer , while the co layer is initialized with uniform magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that the stability of tws is enhanced towards larger py thickness compared to single layers@xcite , due to the screening in the co layer of the stray field arising from the dw in py .    </S>",
    "<S> we used finite - differences micromagnetic codes , both oommf@xcite and our home - made gl - fft code@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cell size in all simulations presented here is @xmath5{nm^3}$ ] ; fo significant difference is found for a cell size @xmath6{nm^3}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> effects of the finite length of the stripe in the simulations were reduced by either fixing at both ends the magnetic moments parallel to the stripe direction , or by compensating the surface magnetic charges at both ends , however with no constraint on magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the length @xmath7 of the stripes was set equal or larger than about @xmath8 , for which finite - size effects are identically small under either of the above procedures . </S>",
    "<S> material parameters are @xmath9{t}$ ] , @xmath10{pj / m}$ ] , @xmath11{t}$ ] , @xmath12{pj / m}$ ] , and zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy in both layers . </S>",
    "<S> no exchange coupling between py and co is considered either . </S>",
    "<S> different initial conditions were chosen in py to set a tw or vw in the py layer , while magnetization in co is set uniform along the stripe direction ; both layers are then set free to evolve during the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we considered head - to - head dws  ( two domains facing each - other , see a ) with no loss of generality , as tail - to - tail dws are equivalent under time - reversal symmetry  ( @xmath13 ) . like for single layers , tws and vws coexist as ( meta)stable states in a large range of geometrical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the iso - energy curve separating the areas where either a tw or a vw is lowest in energy , was determined for each fixed @xmath1 through a parabolic interpolation of the energy difference for three different values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that this procedure yields a phase diagram of the single py layer in very close agreement with existing reports@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) cross - sectional sketch of a head - to - head domain wall and the associated charge in a spin valve . </S>",
    "<S> plane views of a vortex wall and transverse wall in a @xmath14-wide ( b )  single layer of py(@xmath15 ) and ( c )  a co(5 nm)/cu(5 nm)/py(5 nm ) spin valve . </S>",
    "<S> ( d )  thickness - integrated maps of magnetization from ( c ) , see . </S>",
    "<S> the red ( blue ) color indicates the positive ( negative ) transverse component of magnetization , normalized to the magnetization of the layer under focus in ( b ) and ( c ) , and to half the magnetization of co in ( d).,width=328 ]    we first discuss qualitatively the difference between a dw in a single layer and in a spin valve . </S>",
    "<S> the head - to - head dw in py is associated with a total magnetic charge @xmath16a . </S>",
    "<S> while vws are similar in both systems , clear differences are found for tws . in a single layer , tws </S>",
    "<S> are symmetric for small thickness and width . </S>",
    "<S> going towards a larger thickness or width , the tw becomes asymmetric , reducing the magnetostatic energy by spreading the magnetic charges@xciteb ; this corresponds to the onset of zig - zag walls in continuous films . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from symmetric to asymmetric tw is of second order  ( continuous ) , so that for a given geometry only one type of tw exists , either symmetric or asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> asymmetric tws are found for a large range of values of width and thickness , although they are the state of lowest energy ( over the vw ) only in a narrow range of values . in a spin valve </S>",
    "<S> the co layer deviates from uniform magnetization due to the stray field arising from the dw in py , which in turn creates a stray field acting on the py layer . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic screening effect lowers the energy compared to a single layer , as already pointed out@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stray field arising from the dw in py is parallel or antiparallel to the initial direction of magnetization of co , depending whether the left or right side of the dwa is considered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the magnetic configuration of co is expected to be asymmetric , and so will be the stray field arising from co and acting on the py layer . </S>",
    "<S> a tw in a spin valve is therefore expected to be always asymmetric by nature , due to the unidirectional magnetization in the co layer .    </S>",
    "<S> c shows a vw and a tw in a spin valve , with the same stripe width and py thickness as in b. the magnetic screening in co is clear from the non - uniformity of magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from the symmetry arguments given above the tw is asymmetric , to a larger extent than in the single layer case@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both the vw and tw have a larger width , associated with the emergence of tails . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as a dw profile results from the balance of magnetostatic with exchange energy , the decrease of magnetostatic energy allows to reduce exchange energy via the increase of the dw width . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with simple analytical models@xcite derived for charged ( head - to - head ) domain walls in extended spin - valve thin films .    </S>",
    "<S> the flux closure taking place between py and co can also be illustrated by the map of magnetization @xmath17 integrated over the two layers along their normal d :    @xmath18    this map shows similarities with a vw , which highlights the principle of reduction of the total energy : the flux is better closed than in a single layer tw , while avoiding the cost associated with the vortex core in a single layer vw . </S>",
    "<S> in this view the dw tails of the individual layers are also absent .    </S>",
    "<S> phase diagram of head - to - head domain walls in stripes , with the boundary between symmetric and asymmetric tws  ( @xmath19 ) , and tw and vw  ( @xmath20 ) in a single layer , and asymmetric tw and vw in a spin valve  ( @xmath21 ) . from bottom to top , the three lines are : a @xmath22 fit to the tw - vw data for a single layer , a thickness translation of the former to fit the tw - vw data for a spin valve , and another thickness translation with @xmath23 , see and text for details.,width=321 ]    as the share of magnetostatic energy is larger in a tw than in a vw@xcite , the inter - layer closure of flux is lowers the energy of the tw more than that of the vw . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the tw should be the ground state in a larger range of geometrical parameters in a spin valve than in a single layer . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by a set of simulations with varying @xmath4 and @xmath1 , illustrated in for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in a single layer tws with opposite asymmetries ( left or right ) are degenerate in energy , while this degeneracy is lifted in a spin valve , due to the unidirectional magnetization in the underlying co. in the phase diagram we considered only the tw with the lowest energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we now derive a simple analytical model to grasp the main features of this diagram . </S>",
    "<S> mcmichael and donahue already noticed that the iso - energy line in a single layer follows the power law @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the dipolar exchange length , @xmath27 the dipolar constant , and @xmath28 a constant . </S>",
    "<S> this law can be derived qualitatively by balancing the energies at play in each domain wall@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors argued that the energy of the tw can be estimated from the lateral demagnetizing coefficient scaling like @xmath29 , and the volume of the tw of the order of @xmath30 ( thus @xmath31 as a whole ) , while that of the vw is related to the energy of the vortex core , scaling with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange energy in the @xmath33 nel sub - walls can be ignored as the total length of these walls is identical in a tw and a vw . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value @xmath34 must be provided by simulations@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this scaling model can be adapted to a spin valve , however the above arguments must first be discussed in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> it shall first be noted that in any head - to - head dw , either tw or vw , most of the energy is of magnetostatic origin and related to the head - to - head charges , so that the above argument must be refined . </S>",
    "<S> simulation and magnetic force microscopy of a head - to - head dw in a single layer show that the total charge @xmath35 is nearly uniformly spread over the area of the dw@xcite , which is @xmath36 for a tw , and @xmath37 for a vw . </S>",
    "<S> the associated densities of surface charges are then @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting volume density of stray field energy scales with @xmath40 and extends over a typical distance @xmath1 above and below the stripe . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an excess of magnetostatic energy in the tw over the vw of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we now consider a spin valve . in the limit @xmath42 , which is suitable for @xmath43 and the boundaries of the phase diagram of practical interest@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the deformation in co reaches its maximum while not being enough for a full screening of the charges arising from the dw in py . </S>",
    "<S> the above scaling laws can be rewritten accordingly and the following law is derived again with some approximations ( see below ) , making also use of the partial flux closure in spin valves to refine the lateral demagnetizing coefficient@xcite :    @xmath44    this suggests that the phase diagram for a spin valve is based on that of a single layer , shifted towards higher thicknesses by a value @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in very good agreement with the results of numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the analytical formula for @xmath45 is not simple , implying both power and logarithmic functions . </S>",
    "<S> however , thanks to the slow variation of the latter , @xmath45 can be approximated faithfully with @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath24 the analytical model thus yields @xmath47 , while @xmath45 determined from simulations is @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is linked with the magnetic screening in the co layer being partial . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood as in the scaling model we neglect the magnetostatic energy stored in the volume of the cu spacer , locus of a magnetic field arising between the charges of opposite sign in py and in co. shows @xmath45 resulting from micromagnetic simulations as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath49 and @xmath43 . for large @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the problem tends towards the case of a single layer because the screening is no more effective . </S>",
    "<S> the decay is close to exponential , with a fit providing the extrapolation @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure is now in excellent agreement with the analytical model , which suggests the following empirical law :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is derived from . </S>",
    "<S> additional micromagnetic simulations show that @xmath53 increases with @xmath1 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this trend can be understood as the initial stray field ( to be reduced through screening ) arising from the dw extends outside the stripe over a volume scaling with @xmath58 , while the magnetic field arising between the charges of opposite sign in py and in co ( a side cost of the screening effect ) applies in a volume scaling with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the relative gain of energy through screening decreases with decreasing the stripe width . then , can be applied for other co thicknesses , or more generally to other couples of magnetic materials if substituting the proper spontaneous magnetization values in , and fitting the decay of @xmath45 like in .    </S>",
    "<S> one must finally keep in mind that for @xmath60 a very effective screening of the head - to - head dw charge is possible , so that deviations from are expected . in that case , the energy of the tw is drastically reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the iso - energy line becomes very flat beyond this limit , an effect that starts to be visible for the largest widths in .    </S>",
    "<S> thickness shift of the iso - energy line in a spin valve compared to a single layer , for @xmath49 and @xmath43.,width=276 ]    to conclude , we have investigated with numerical simulation and analytical scaling laws the phase diagram of head - to - head domain walls in f1/nm / f2 spin valves , with a domain wall in one layer and no domain wall in the other layer . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the range of stability of transverse versus vortex walls is enhanced due to a magnetic screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> the iso - energy line in spin valves is translated towards a larger thickness with respect to single layers , by a value decreasing approximately exponentially with the spacer thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this enhanced stability and larger width provide a magnetostatic contribution to the high mobility of dws in trilayers , provided that the damping in co is not too large@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> effects on the domain wall inertia and automotion@xcite are also expected . </S>"
