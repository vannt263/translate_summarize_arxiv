    "<S> we analyze two approaches to the quantum - classical liouville ( qcl ) formalism that differ in the order of two operations : wigner transformation and projection onto adiabatic electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out on a two - dimensional linear vibronic model where geometric phase ( gp ) effects arising from a conical intersection profoundly affect nuclear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wigner - then - adiabatic ( wa ) qcl approach captures gp effects , whereas the adiabatic - then - wigner ( aw ) qcl approach does not . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the wigner transform in aw - qcl leads to an ill - defined fourier transform of double - valued functions . </S>",
    "<S> the double - valued character of these functions stems from the nontrivial gp of adiabatic electronic states in the presence of a conical intersection . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , wa - qcl avoids this issue by starting with the wigner transform of single - valued quantities of the full problem . </S>",
    "<S> since the wa - qcl approach uses solely the adiabatic potentials and non - adiabatic derivative couplings as an input , our results indicate that wa - qcl can capture gp effects in general two - state crossing problems using first - principles electronic structure calculations without prior diabatization or introduction of explicit phase factors . </S>"
