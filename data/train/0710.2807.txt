    "while more than 250 extra - solar planets orbiting main - sequence stars have been discovered , the destiny of planetary systems in the late stages of the evolution of their host stars is very uncertain , and so far no planet has been found around a white dwarf .",
    "infrared excess detected around a number of white dwarfs has been interpreted as the signature of dust discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photospheres of these white dwarfs are rich in metals @xcite , indicating ongoing accretion from the circumstellar material .",
    "the likely origin of these debris discs are tidally disrupted asteroids @xcite , and hence they represent a close association with the planetary systems that the white dwarf progenitor stars may have had .",
    "however , while the infrared excess detected around these white dwarfs can be explained in terms of a dusty debris disc , the observations actually do not provide any strong constraint on the geometry of the source of the infrared light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we summarise here our recent discovery of two white dwarfs in the sdss spectroscopic data base which exhibit double - peaked emission lines of caii@xmath18600 , unambiguously confirming a circumstellar disc - like structure @xcite",
    "visually inspecting the sdss spectra of several hundred white dwarfs , we noticed very unusual caii@xmath18600 emission lines in sdssj122859.93 + 104032.9 ( fig.1 ) and sdssj104341.53 + 085558.2 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the double - peaked shape of these line profiles is the unmistakable signature of gas rotating around these stars on keplerian orbits @xcite .     to h@xmath4 line profiles ( top to bottom , gray lines ) along with the best - fit white dwarf model ( black lines ) .",
    "top right panel : 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath5 @xmath6 contour plots in the @xmath7 plane .",
    "the line profiles allow a `` hot '' and a `` cold '' solution ( black dots ) on either side of the temperature corresponding to maximum balmer line equivalent widths ( dashed line ) .",
    "the degeneracy in the line profile fits is lifted by the best - fit to the continuum slope ( red dot ) .",
    "the best - fit to the line profiles results in @xmath8k and @xmath9 .",
    "bottom panels : the white dwarf spectrum and associated flux errors ( gray lines ) along with the best - fit white dwarf model ( black line ) to the 38507150  wavelength range ( top ) and the residuals of the fit ( gray line , bottom ) .",

    ", even wd0137349 and sdss1035 + 0551 , two white dwarf / brown dwarf binaries , display copious amounts of h@xmath11 emission @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those binaries , the spectrum of sdssj1228 + 1040 is totally devoid of balmer emission .",
    "we obtained time - resolved intermediate resolution spectroscopy and photometric time series of sdssj1228 + 1040 , which clearly rule out the possibility of this object being a white dwarf plus low mass companion binary .",
    "photospheric mgi@xmath124482 absorption lines demonstrates that both sdssj1228 + 1040 and sdssj1043 + 0855 are accreting from their circumstellar discs .",
    "stellar parameter of the two white dwarfs ( fig.1 & 2 , table1 ) were determined from spectral fits using tlusty and synspec models @xcite .",
    "the absence of hydrogen ( and/or helium ) emission from material close to a @xmath13k white dwarf implies that the circumstellar material must be depleted in volatile elements . a low content ( @xmath14% solar ) of helium in the circumstellar material",
    "is corroborated by the absence of helium lines in the spectrum of sdssj1228 + 1040 . a dynamical model of the caii line profiles in sdssj1228 + 1040 computed following @xcite implies an outer radius of the disc of just 1.2 solar radii .",
    "this circumstellar material can not have survived the red giant phase of the white dwarf progenitor at its current location , and must have been supplied from distances greater than 1000@xmath15 after the formation of the white dwarf . a plausible originally is the tidal disruption of a rocky asteroid @xcite , probably destabilised from its original much wider orbit by interaction with a larger object @xcite .    ccccccc system & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & mg abund . & caii e.w",

    "it has been suggested that planetary systems may survive the post - main sequence evolution of their host stars @xcite , however , no planet has yet been discovered around a white dwarf .",
    "the detection of debris discs from rocky asteroids around white dwarfs , such as sdssj1228 + 1040 and sdssj1043 + 0855 and the cooler white dwarfs with dusty debris discs lends strong support to the survival hypothesis .",
    "it appears also entirely possible that these white dwarfs may still have planetesimal objects or planets .",
    "sdssj1228 + 1040 is particular interesting , as its relatively high mass implies that its progenitor must have had a mass of @xmath27 @xcite , suggesting that also short - lived massive stars may be host to planetary discs .",
