    "there exist several relatively new applications where the energy distribution of the neutrons plays a significant role .",
    "one particular case is a method used in nuclear safeguards , namely the stochastic generalization of the so - called differential die - away analysis ( ddaa ) @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the ddaa method was used as a deterministic method of detecting fissile material embedded in moderating surroundings using a pulsed source .",
    "the newly explored method , called differential die - away self - interrogation ( ddsi ) utilizes the inherent spontaneous neutron emission of the sample @xcite . in the ddsi method the temporal decay of the correlations as a function of the time delay between two detections of fast neutrons is used .",
    "this corresponds to a rossi - alpha measurement with two energy groups .",
    "furthermore , in recent pulsed experiments measuring the reactivity in fast cores of accelerator driven sub - critical systems it is found that two exponentials appear , indicating that the temporal behavior of the fast and thermal neutrons is separated in fast reflected cores .",
    "this leads to the fact that a two group versions of the feynman and rossi - alpha formulas are needed @xcite-@xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", a stochastic theory for a branching process in a neutron population with two energy levels is investigated based on the previous results in refs  @xcite-  @xcite . in particular a variance to mean or feynman - alpha formula is derived in this generalized scenario using the master equation or kolmogorov forward approach .",
    "the model includes absorbtions , down scattering from fast to thermal neutrons , thermal fissions , detections and an external source of fast neutrons .",
    "higher moments will also be discussed as well as specific applications to areas within safeguards research as well as specific applications to areas within safeguards research .",
    "in this section we will describe the two particle type system by using the kolmogorov forward approach .",
    "we will include a compound poisson source of fast neutrons described by the source strength @xmath3 which releases @xmath4 particles with probability @xmath5 at an emission event ( i.e. spontaneous fission ) .",
    "the source is assumed to be switched on at time @xmath6 , although dependence on @xmath7 will not be denoted .",
    "the effects of detecting particles will also be included , denoted by the intensity @xmath8 .",
    "we will start by giving the differential equation for the probability @xmath9 for @xmath10 fast , @xmath11 thermal neutrons at time @xmath12 and @xmath13 detected fast particles in the interval @xmath14 .",
    "we have summed all mutually exclusive events during an infinitesimally small time interval @xmath15 and find for probabilities , @xmath16 here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the decay constants ( total reaction intensities ) for fast and thermal neutrons whereas @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the absorbtion intensities of fast and thermal particles , respectively . the removal of fast particles into the thermal group is described by @xmath21 while fission resulting from the thermal particles happens with the intensity of @xmath22 .",
    "the intensities are related through @xmath23 and @xmath24 we will now solve this differential equation by using the generating function of the form @xmath25 and describe the process in the time evolution of the generating function as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the probability of having exactly @xmath29 neutrons produced in a fission event .",
    "differentiation of equation ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) with respect to ( @xmath30 ) and then letting ( @xmath31 ) yields differential equations for the expectations as , @xmath32 here we have used the definition of the derivatives on the equations ( [ eq:1.61 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.62 ] ) as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we note that due to the source term with intensity @xmath3 the dynamical system consisting of equations ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) - ( [ eq:1.8 ] ) will reach a steady state ( @xmath35 ) and we find the stationary solution , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and we have used the additional definitions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 the expectation of the detections is found by integrating equation ( 10 ) and we note that the number of detections increases linearly with time . in order to find the variance of the detector counts we need to determine the second factorial moment by yet another differentiation with respect to ( @xmath30 ) and then letting ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the variance of the detector counts can be determined through the relation @xmath41 where the modified variance @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 while in general we have @xmath44 .",
    "the differentiation procedure gives a system of six dynamical equations of the modified second moments as @xmath45 where we have used the additional notations @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "although , the system of equations ( [ eq:1.16 ] ) - ( [ eq:1.21 ] ) is rather complicated and an analytical solution would be hard to find , we note that in stationary state the system breaks down into two systems independent of each other where the moments @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants . however , the equations describing detected particles need to be solved by e.g. laplace transforms of ( [ eq:1.19 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.20 ] ) whereas it is possible to find the sought moment @xmath51 by integration by using equation ( [ eq:1.21 ] ) .",
    "we find the constant 2nd modified moments as , @xmath52 the objective now is to solve ( [ eq:1.19 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.20 ] ) by laplace transform methods and we find the transformed identity as , @xmath53 with @xmath54 note that we have assumed that the initial values of the moments @xmath55 and @xmath56 were equal to zero at @xmath57 ( at the start of the measurement ) , hence the roots of @xmath58 determine the temporal behavior of the feynman - alpha formula .",
    "moreover , the solution has many similarities to that found in ref .",
    "the variance @xmath59 is now found by integration of ( [ eq:1.21 ] ) and after some algebra the feynman - alpha formula can now be written in the form @xmath60 here , the complete expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 are quite lengthy",
    ". however , it turns out that the sum @xmath63 takes a rather simple form that also determines the value of the feynman - alpha for large measurement times @xmath64 as , @xmath65 we will now turn our attention to some quantitative examples of the feynman - alpha formula in the form of equation ( [ eq:1.27 ] ) .",
    "the feynman - alpha formula for a two particle type system found by using the kolmogorov forward approach including a poisson source and effects of detecting particles is shown in figure 1 ( a and b ) .",
    "we have used the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in figure 1a",
    "@xmath73 whereas in figure 1b @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as expected , the curves grow according to equation ( [ eq:1.27 ] ) exponentially to a maximum value determined by the constant @xmath76 . however , this value can signifcantly vary depending on the intensities ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc ) involved the process .",
    "the increase of the curves is determined by two exponentials .",
    "furthermore , unlike the case of the ddsi method , the presence of the two exponentials is not visible to the bare eye . in figure 1a , it is seen that the ratio of the decay intensities for fast and thermal particles has a nontrivial effect on the maximum value by changing the ratio in the range ( @xmath77 ) . in figure 1b ,",
    "the effect of the thermalization process described by the intensity @xmath21 on the results is illustrated .",
    "increasing thermalization increases the asymptotic value of the feynman - alpha .    , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "in figure a , @xmath73 whereas in figure b @xmath74 and @xmath75 . , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=245 ] [ fig : figure1 ]    , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in figure a , @xmath73 whereas in figure b @xmath74 and @xmath75 . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=245 ] [ fig : figure2 ]",
    "we have developed a forward kolmogorov approach for the two group theory of the feynman - alpha method , including a compound poisson source and the detection process .",
    "the results agree with those calculated by the backward approach as reported in @xcite .",
    "it is seen that , unlike in the ddsi method ( i.e. the two - group version of the rossi - alpha method ) , the presence of two exponents in the solution is not clearly visible .",
    "this means that detection of the presence of fissile material may not be as obvious as with the rossi - alpha method . on the other hand ,",
    "the determination of the exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 by curve fitting could be more accurate in certain cases than with the ddsi method .",
    "however , the diagnostic value of the exponents in terms of determination of the sample parameters is not clear yet , and it requires further investigations , which will be reported in further work .",
