    "this work arose from the following question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ given a convex polytope @xmath3 in @xmath0 and a point @xmath4 inside @xmath3 , does there exist a projective transformation @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is the centroid of the vertices of @xmath7 ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for example , if @xmath3 is a @xmath2-simplex , then as @xmath5 one can take the projective transformation that fixes the vertices of @xmath3 and maps @xmath4 to the centroid of @xmath3 .",
    "the question can be generalized as follows :    [ quest:1 ] given two subsets @xmath8 , does there exist a projective transformation @xmath9 such that the centroids of @xmath10 and @xmath11 coincide ?",
    "the centroid @xmath12 can be defined ( by the usual integral formula ) for any subset @xmath13 that has a positive finite @xmath14-hausdorff measure for some @xmath15 , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "thus , any of the sets @xmath16 in question [ quest:1 ] may be , say , a convex polytope or the @xmath14-skeleton of a convex polytope .",
    "if @xmath17 or @xmath18 , then the centroid of @xmath19 is affinely covariant : @xmath20",
    "so that we can quotient out affine transformations when searching for @xmath5 . since @xmath21 , the `` number of equations '' becomes equal to the `` number of variables '' , and the following question poses itself .",
    "[ quest:2 ] if @xmath22 in question [ quest:1 ] , then is @xmath23 such that @xmath24 unique up to post - composition with an affine transformation ?",
    "for example , if @xmath25 is the vertex set of a simplex , and @xmath26 is a single point , then @xmath5 is unique in the above sense .    for @xmath27",
    "the centroid is in general not affinely covariant .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the centroid of the boundary of a triangle coincides with the centroid of its vertices if and only if the triangle is regular . as the centroid of the vertices is affinely covariant ,",
    "the centroid of the boundary is not .",
    "see @xcite for centroids of skeleta of simplices in higher dimensions .",
    "let us discuss some restrictions we will impose on @xmath16 and @xmath5 .",
    "first , @xmath19 is always assumed to be compact and equal to the closure of its interior .",
    "the latter is not really a restriction , since replacing @xmath19 by the closure of @xmath28 does nt change the centroid .",
    "second , we will always assume one set to be contained in the convex hull of the other : @xmath29 .",
    "although this looks quite restrictive , it leaves enough room for non - trivial results .",
    "for an idea of what can be done in the case when the convex hulls are incomparable , see section [ sec : futres ] .",
    "third , in order for the centroid of @xmath30 to be defined , no point of @xmath19 may be sent to infinity for @xmath17 and @xmath31 must hold for @xmath18 .",
    "the following restriction ( together with compactness of @xmath19 ) guarantees both .",
    "[ dfn : admissible ] let @xmath32 . a projective transformation",
    "@xmath9 is called _ admissible _ for @xmath19 , if @xmath33 .",
    "non - admissible projective transformations are more difficult to handle ; besides , admissible transformations will often suffice .",
    "if we allow a projective transformation to send to infinity a hyperplane that separates the points @xmath34 , then we can lose the uniqueness , see proposition [ prp : nonadm ] .    the requirement that @xmath19 is equal to the closure of its interior forbids @xmath19 to have `` antennas '' .",
    "it turns out , we heed to forbid `` horns '' in order to ensure the existence of a suitable projective transformation .",
    "a @xmath2-dimensional compact subset @xmath13 is called _ cusp - free _ , if for every @xmath35 there is a @xmath2-simplex contained in @xmath19 with a vertex at @xmath36 .",
    "examples of cusp - free sets are : pure @xmath2-dimensional polyhedra ( finite unions of convex @xmath2-dimensional polyhedra ) ; @xmath2-submanifolds of @xmath0 with smooth boundary ; @xmath2-submanifolds with corners .      here",

    "a projective transformation modulo post - composition with affine ones is uniquely determined by the hyperplane @xmath44 that it sends to infinity .",
    "associate to every @xmath45 the point @xmath4 that becomes the centroid of @xmath46 after @xmath45 is sent to infinity .",
    "then , by theorem [ thm : onevsmany ] , the hyperplanes disjoint from @xmath47 are in one - to - one correspondence with the points inside the convex hull .",
    "this correspondence is related to the polarity with respect to an algebraic set .",
    "namely , let @xmath48 be the union of the hyperplanes dual to @xmath46 ; then the dual of @xmath4 is the polar with respect to  @xmath48 of the dual of  @xmath45 .",

    "interestingly enough , the assumptions leading to existence become obsolete , and the transformation turns out to be unique , if @xmath19 is a ball . since the image of a ball under an admissible projective transformation is an ellipsoid , and the ellipsoid can be mapped back to the ball by an affine transformation , the following theorem is equivalent to the existence and uniqueness of a projective transformation fitting the centroids of a ball and of a finite set .",
