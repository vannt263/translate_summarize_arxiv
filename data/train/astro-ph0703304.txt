    "the compressible , inviscid and thin disc flow has by now become an established model in accretion studies  @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly expedient and simple physical system to study , especially as regards the rotating flow in the innermost regions of the disc , in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "steady global solutions of inviscid axisymmetric accretion on to a black hole have been meticulously studied over the years , and at present there exists an extensive body of literature devoted to the subject , with especial emphasis on the transonic nature of solutions , the multitransonic character of the flow , formation of shocks , and the stability of global solutions under time - dependent linearised perturbations .",
    "having stressed the usefulness of the inviscid model among researchers in accretion astrophysics , it must also be recognised that this model has its own limitations .",
    "it is easy to understand that while the presence of angular momentum leads to the formation of an accretion disc in the first place , a physical mechanism must also be found for the outward transport of angular momentum , which should then make possible the inward drift of the accreting matter into the potential well of the accretor .",
    "viscosity has been known all along to be a just such a physical means to effect infall , although the exact presciption for viscosity in an accretion disc is still a matter of much debate  @xcite . what is well appreciated , however , is that the viscous prescription should be compatible with an enhanced outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "the very well - known @xmath0 parametrisation of  @xcite is based on this principle .",
    "and so it transpires that on global scales  especially on the very largest scales of the disc  the inviscid model will encounter difficulties in the face of the fact that without an effective outward transport of angular momentum , the accretion process can not be sustained globally .",
    "to address this adverse issue , what is being introduced in this paper is the  quasi - viscous \" disc model .",
    "this model involves prescribing a very small first - order viscous correction in the @xmath0-viscosity parameter of  @xcite , about the zeroth - order inviscid solution . in doing this ,",
    "a viscous generalisation of the inviscid flow can be logically extended to capture the important physical properties of accretion discs on large length scales , without compromising on the fundamentally simple and elegant features of the inviscid model .",
    "this is the single most appealing aspect of the quasi - viscous disc model vis - a - vis many other standard models of axisymmetric flows which involve viscosity  @xcite .    while many previous works have also taken up the question of the stability of viscous thin disc accretion  @xcite , the specific objective of the present paper is to study the stability of stationary quasi - viscous inflow solutions under the influence of a time - dependent and linearised radial perturbation .",
    "it has already been shown in some earlier works that inviscid solutions are stable under a perturbation of this kind  @xcite .",
    "what has been found through this particular work is that with the merest presence of viscosity ( i.e. to a first order in @xmath0 , which itself is much less than unity ) about the stationary inviscid solutions , instabilities develop exponentially on large length scales .",
    "this has disturbing implications , because all physically meaningful inflow solutions will have to pass through these length scales , connecting the outer boundary of the flow with the surface of the accretor ( or the event horizon , if the accretor is a black hole ) .",
    "the perturbative treatment has been executed in two separate ways  as a standing wave and as a high - frequency travelling wave , and in both cases the perturbation displays growth behaviour .",
    "it need not always be true that standing and travelling waves will simultaneously exhibit the same qualitative properties as far as stability is concerned .",
    "many instances in fluid dynamics bear this out . in the case of binary fluids ,",
    "standing waves indicate instability as opposed to travelling waves  @xcite , while the whole physical picture is quite the opposite for the fluid dynamical problem of the hydraulic jump  @xcite .",
    "contrary to all this the axisymmetric stationary quasi - viscous flow is greatly disturbed both by a standing wave and by a travelling wave .",
    "this provides convincing evidence of its unstable character , and it is very much in consonance with similar conclusions drawn from some earlier studies",
    ". for high - frequency radial perturbations  @xcite have found that inertial - acoustic modes are locally unstable , with a greater degree of growth for the outward travelling modes than the inward ones . on the other hand ,  @xcite",
    "have revealed a growth in the amplitude of a non - propagating perturbation at the critical point , which , however , stabilises in the inviscid regime .",
    "this kind of instability  one that manifests itself only if some dissipative mechanism ( viscous dissipation in the case of the quasi - viscous rotational flow ) is operative  is called _ secular instability _",
    "@xcite . it should be very much instructive here to furnish a parallel instance of the destabilising influence of viscous dissipation in a system undergoing rotation : that of the effect of viscous dissipation in a maclaurin spheroid  @xcite . in studying ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium",
    ",  @xcite has discussed that a secular instability develops in a maclaurin spheroid , when the stresses derive from an ordinary viscosity which is defined in terms of a coefficient of kinematic viscosity ( as the @xmath0 parametrisation is for an accretion disc ) , and when the effects arising from viscous dissipation are considered as small perturbations on the inviscid flow , to be taken into account in the first order only .",
    "it is exactly in this spirit that the  quasi - viscous \" approximation has been prescribed for the thin accretion disc , although , unlike a maclaurin spheroid , an astrophysical accretion disc is an open system .",
    "curiously enough , the geometry of the fluid flow also seems to be having a bearing on the issue of stability .",
    "the same kind of study , as has been done here with viscosity in a rotational flow , had also been done earlier for a viscous spherically symmetric accreting system . in that treatment",
    "@xcite viscosity was found to have a stabilising influence on the system , causing a viscosity - dependent decay in the amplitude of a linearised standing - wave perturbation .",
    "this is quite in keeping with the understanding that the respective roles of viscosity are at variance with each other in the two distinctly separate cases of spherically symmetric flows and thin disc flows . while viscosity contributes to the resistance against infall in the former case , in the latter it aids the infall process .",
    "finally , an important aspect of the time - dependent perturbative analysis that may be emphasised is that although the flow has been considered to be driven by the newtonian potential , none of the physical conclusions of this work will be qualified in any serious way upon using any of the pseudo - newtonian potentials  @xcite , which are regularly invoked in accretion - related literature to describe rotational flows on to a schwarzschild black hole , even while preserving the newtonian construct of space and time .",
    "this shall be especially true of the flow on large scales , where all pseudo - newtonian potentials converge to the newtonian limit , and , therefore , the conclusions of this perturbative treatment will also have a similar bearing on pseudo - schwarzschild flows .",
    "for the thin disc , under the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium along the vertical direction  @xcite , two of the relevant flow variables are the drift velocity , @xmath1 , and the surface density , @xmath2 . in the thin - disc approximation",
    "the latter has been defined by vertically integrating the volume density , @xmath3 , over the disc thickness , @xmath4 .",
    "this gives @xmath5 , and in terms of @xmath2 , the continuity equation is set down as @xmath6 for a flow driven by the newtonian potential , @xmath7 , assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction will give the condition @xmath8 , in which the local speed of sound , @xmath9 , and the local keplerian velocity , @xmath10 , are , respectively , defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with the constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 deriving from the application of a polytropic equation of state , @xmath15 , in terms of which , the speed of sound may given as @xmath16 .",
    "written explicitly , the disc height is , therefore , expressed as @xmath17 and with the use of this result , the continuity equation could then be recast as @xmath18   + \\frac{1}{r^{5/2 } }   \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}r } \\left[\\rho^{(\\gamma + 1)/2}vr^{5/2}\\right]=0 .\\ ] ]    the condition for the balance of specific angular momentum in the flow is given by  @xcite , @xmath19 = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi r } \\left(\\frac{{\\partial}\\mathcal{g}}{{\\partial}r}\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the local angular velocity of the flow , while the torque is given as @xmath21 with @xmath22 being the kinematic viscosity associated with the flow . with the use of the continuity equation , as equation  ( [ consig ] ) gives it , and going by the  @xcite prescription for the kinematic viscosity , @xmath23 , it would be easy to reduce equation  ( [ angsig ] ) to the form  @xcite @xmath24 , \\ ] ] with @xmath25 being defined from @xmath26 .",
    "going back to equation  ( [ conrho ] ) , a new variable is defined as @xmath27 , whose steady value , as it is very easy to see from equation  ( [ conrho ] ) , can be closely identified with the constant matter flux rate . in terms of this new variable , equation  ( [ conrho ] ) can be modified as @xmath28 + \\frac{1}{r^{5/2 } } \\frac{{\\partial}f}{{\\partial}r } = 0 , \\ ] ] while equation  ( [ angrho ] ) can be rendered as @xmath29 .\\ ] ]    the inviscid disc model is given by the requirement that @xmath30 , in which @xmath31 is the constant specific angular momentum .",
    "the quasi - viscous disc that is being proposed here will introduce a first - order correction in terms involving @xmath0 , the  @xcite viscosity parameter , about the constant angular momentum solution .",
    "mathematically this will be represented by the prescription of an effective specific angular momentum , @xmath32 with the form of @xmath33 having to be determined from equation  ( [ angeff ] ) , under the stipulation that the dimensionless @xmath0-viscosity parameter is much smaller than unity .",
    "this smallness of the quasi - viscous correction induces only very small changes on the constant angular momentum background , and , therefore , neglecting all orders of @xmath0 higher than the first , and ignoring any explicit time - variation of the viscous correction term , the latter being a standard method adopted also for keplerian flows  @xcite , the dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath1 and @xmath3 is obtained as @xmath34 .\\ ] ] the effect of the absence and the presence of a small viscous correction to the inviscid background flow has been schematically shown in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] &  [ f2 ] , respectively .            the stationary solution of equation  ( [ coneff ] ) can be easily obtained as a first integral , and with the help of equation  ( [ aitch ] ) , it can be set down as @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the conserved matter inflow rate .",
    "the negative sign arises because for inflows , @xmath1 goes with a negative sign .",
    "further , under stationary conditions , equation  ( [ effecang ] ) can be written in a modified form as @xmath37 from equation  ( [ statiocon ] ) , with @xmath3 approaching a constant asymptotic value on large length scales , the drift velocity , @xmath1 , can be seen to go asymptotically as @xmath38 .",
    "bearing in mind that for inflows , @xmath39 , the asymptotic dependence of the effective angular momentum can be shown to be @xmath40 with @xmath41 being a scale of length , which , to an order - of - magnitude , is given by @xmath42^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour is entirely to be expected , because the physical role of viscosity is to transport angular momentum to large length scales of the accretion disc .",
    "lastly , the equation for radial momentum balance in the flow will also have to be modified under the condition of quasi - viscous dissipation .",
    "this has to be done according to the scheme outlined in equation  ( [ effecang ] ) by which , the centrifugal term , @xmath43 , of the radial momentum balance equation , will have to be corrected upto a first order in @xmath0 .",
    "this will finally lead to the result @xmath44 with @xmath33 being given by equation  ( [ tilomeg ] ) , and @xmath45 being expressed as a function of @xmath3 with the help of a polytropic equation of state , as has been mentioned earlier .",
    "the steady solution of equation  ( [ radmom ] ) is given as @xmath46 whose first integral can not be obtained analytically because of the @xmath0-dependent term . in the inviscid limit , though , the integral is easily obtained .",
    "this case will be governed by conserved conditions , and its solutions have been well - known in accretion literature  @xcite .",
    "they will either be open solutions passing through saddle points or closed paths about centre - type points .",
    "the slightest presence of viscous dissipation , however , will radically alter the nature of solutions seen in the inviscid limit , and it may be easily understood that solutions forming closed paths about centre - type points , will , under conditions of small - viscous correction , be of the spiralling kind  @xcite .",
    "this state of affairs is appreciated very easily by the analogy of the simple harmonic oscillator . in the undamped state",
    "the phase trajectories of the oscillator will , very much like the solutions of the inviscid flow , be either closed paths about centre - type points or open paths through saddle points . with the presence of even very weak damping the closed paths",
    "change into spiralling solutions .",
    "after having understood the qualitative nature of the stationary flows in the quasi - viscous accretion disc , as given by equations  ( [ statiocon ] ) ,  ( [ statioang ] ) and  ( [ statiorad ] ) , it will now become possible to carry out a real - time linear stability analysis about the stationary solutions , with the help of equations  ( [ conrho ] ) and  ( [ radmom ] ) .",
    "about the stationary solutions of the flow variables , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , a time - dependent perturbation is introduced according to the scheme , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in all of which , the subscript ",
    "@xmath50 \" implies stationary values , with @xmath51 especially , as can be seen from equation  ( [ conrho ] ) , being a constant .",
    "this constant , as it is immediately evident from a look at equation  ( [ statiocon ] ) , is very much connected to the matter flow rate , and , therefore , the perturbation @xmath52 is to be seen as a disturbance on the steady , constant background accretion rate . for spherically symmetric flows , this eulerian perturbation scheme has been applied by  @xcite and  @xcite , while for inviscid axisymmetric flows , the same method has been used equally effectively by  @xcite and  @xcite .    the definition of @xmath53 will lead to a linearised dependence among @xmath52 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56 while from equation  ( [ conrho ] ) , an exclusive dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath52 will be obtained as @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",

    "differentiating equation  ( [ flucradmom ] ) partially with respect to @xmath64 , and making use of equations  ( [ flucden ] ) , ( [ flucvel ] ) and  ( [ flucvelder2 ] ) to substitute for all the first and second - order derivatives of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , will deliver the result @xmath65   - 4 \\alpha \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\sigma}{v_0 r^3}\\bigg[\\frac{{\\partial}f^{\\prime } } { { \\partial}t } + \\left(\\frac{3\\gamma -1}{\\gamma + 1}\\right ) v_0   \\frac{{\\partial}f^{\\prime}}{{\\partial}r}\\ ] ] @xmath66 = 0\\ ] ] entirely in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "this is the equation of motion for a perturbation imposed on the constant mass flux rate , @xmath51 , and it shall be important to note here that the choice of a driving potential , newtonian or pseudo - newtonian , has no explicit bearing on the form of the equation .",
    "with a linearised equation of motion for the perturbation having been derived , a solution of the form @xmath67 is applied to it . from equation  ( [ tpert ] )",

    "these two distinct cases will be taken up separately in what follows , to see how stationary solutions are affected by the perturbation .",
    "it can be easily appreciated that with viscous dissipation present in the accreting system , multiply - valued solutions in the phase portrait are a distinct possibility  @xcite .",
    "this , however , is physically not feasible for a fluid flow , and , therefore , for all solutions which are multiply - valued about a critical point , it should be necessary to have the inner branch of a solution fitted to its outer branch via a shock , which is a standard practice in general fluid dynamical studies  @xcite .",
    "the outer branch of this discontinuous solution will connect the shock with the outer boundary of the disc itself , and in the phase portrait of the flow , there will exist an entire family of these outer solutions which arguably shall be subsonic .",
    "it would be worthwhile at this point to remember that for this kind of a thin disc system , the local speed of acoustic propagation would go as @xmath70 , and subsonic solutions would have their bulk flow velocity , @xmath71 , at less than this value . over the entire subsonic range , at two chosen points ,",
    "the perturbation may be spatially constrained by requiring it to be a standing wave , which dies out at the two chosen boundaries .",
    "the outer point could suitably be chosen to be at the outer boundary of the flow itself , where , by virtue of the boundary condition on the steady flow , the perturbation would naturally decay out .",
    "the inner boundary of the standing wave is to be chosen infinitesimally close to the shock front , through which the flow will be discontinuous , and the perturbation will be made to die out in its neighbourhood . between these two points , for solutions which are entirely subsonic , it should be necessary to multiply equation  ( [ disp1 ] ) by @xmath72 , and then carry out an integration by parts .",
    "the requirement that all integrated  surface terms \" vanish at the two boundaries of the standing wave , will give a quadratic dispersion relation in @xmath73 , which will read as @xmath74 in which the coefficients of each successive term will be given by @xmath75\\,{{\\mathrm}d}r\\ ] ] and @xmath76    it is possible now to find a solution for @xmath73 , but of greater immediate significance is the fact that this solution will yield an @xmath0-dependent real part of the temporal component of the perturbation , which will go as @xmath77 \\left [ \\int \\left(v_0 g^2_\\omega \\right ) \\ , { { \\mathrm}d}r \\right]^{-1 }   \\sim \\alpha \\xi ( r ) , \\ ] ] with @xmath78 itself being expressed as @xmath79 in which the mach number , @xmath80 .",
    "it is globally true that @xmath81 . in this situation , under the assumption that the mach number has a power - law dependence on the radial distance , given as @xmath82 , it is possible to write down , @xmath83    on large length scales , with @xmath63 approaching a constant ambient value , and with @xmath84 from the continuity condition , it is easily deduced that @xmath85 .",
    "this indicates that on large length scales , the amplitude of the spatially constrained standing - wave perturbation grows in time , i.e. the subsonic solutions on which this perturbation has been imposed , display unstable behaviour .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath0 vanishes , all stationary solutions restricted by the condition @xmath86 , are stable under a standing - wave perturbation , which displays a purely oscillatory behaviour with no growth in amplitude .",
    "for the inviscid disc ( with @xmath87 ) this has been shown by  @xcite .",
    "regarding this point , it will be instructive to mention again that  @xcite have pointed to the existence of a non - propagating growing perturbation localised at the critical point , but interestingly enough they have also found that this instability disappears in inviscid transonic flows .",
    "the perturbation is now made to behave in the manner of a radially travelling wave , whose wavelength is suitably constrained to be small , i.e. it is to be smaller than any characteristic length scale in the system . a perturbative treatment of this nature has been carried out before on spherically symmetric flows  @xcite and on axisymmetric flows  @xcite . in both these cases the radius of the accretor was chosen as the characteristic length scale in question , and the wavelength of the perturbation was required to be much smaller than this length scale . in this study of an axisymmetric flow driven by a newtonian potential ,",
    "the radius of the accreting star , @xmath88 , could be a choice for such a length scale . as a result",
    ", the frequency , @xmath73 , of the waves should be large .",

    "the coefficients of each of these terms are to be collected first and then individually summed up .",
    "this is to be followed by setting each of these sums separately to zero , which will yield for @xmath100 , @xmath73 and @xmath101 , respectively , the conditions @xmath102 @xmath103 \\frac{{{\\mathrm}d}k_{-1}}{{{\\mathrm}d}r}\\ ] ] @xmath104 and @xmath105 +   \\left [ 3 v_0 \\frac{{{\\mathrm}d}v_0}{{{\\mathrm}d}r } - \\frac{1}{v_0 } \\frac{{\\mathrm}d}{{{\\mathrm}d}r } \\left(v_0 \\beta^2 c_{{\\mathrm}{s0}}^2 \\right )   - 2 \\alpha \\lambda^2 \\left(3 \\gamma -1\\right)\\frac{\\beta^2 \\sigma } { r^3 } \\right]\\frac{{{\\mathrm}d}k_0}{{{\\mathrm}d}r}\\ ] ] @xmath106 out of these , the first two , i.e. equations  ( [ omegsq ] ) and  ( [ omeg1 ] ) , will deliver the solutions @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the two foregoing expressions give the leading terms in the power series of @xmath92 .",
    "while dwelling on this matter , it will also be necessary to show that all successive terms of @xmath109 will self - consistently follow the condition @xmath110 , i.e. the power series given by @xmath92 will converge very quickly with increasing @xmath111 . in the inviscid limit",

    "this in itself is an indication of the extent to which viscosity might alter the inviscid conditions .",
    "however , since @xmath0 has been chosen to be very much less than unity , and since the wavelength of the travelling waves is also very small , implying that @xmath119 , the self - consistency requirement still holds . therefore , as far as gaining a qualitative understanding of the effect of viscosity is concerned , it should be quite sufficient to truncate the power series expansion of @xmath109 after considering the two leading terms only , and with the help of these two , an expression for the perturbation may be set down as @xmath120   \\exp \\left ( \\int \\frac{{{\\mathrm}i } \\omega}{v_0 \\pm \\beta c_{{\\mathrm}{s0 } } } \\ , { { \\mathrm}d}r \\right ) e^{-{{\\mathrm}i } \\omega t } , \\ ] ] which should be seen as a linear superposition of two waves with arbitrary constants @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "it is easy to check that under inviscid conditions , with @xmath148 , and for an adiabatic perturbation with @xmath149 , the disc will immediately revert to stable behaviour  @xcite .",
    "the instability of the quasi - viscous disc raises some doubts , the primary one of these being on the possibility of a long - time evolution of the disc towards a stationary end . the quasi - viscous disc being a dissipative system , i.e. its energy being allowed to be drained away from this system , there can not be any occasion to look for the selection of a particular solution , and a selection criterion thereof , on the basis of energy minimisation , as it can be done for an idealised inviscid flow , such as the bondi solution in spherical symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this , of course , shall also affect the flow rate , which , in this treatment , has been perturbed and has been found unstable . as a result of all this the whole system has been left without any well - defined criterion by which it could guide itself towards a steady state , transonic or otherwise .",
    "one very important physical role of viscosity in an accretion disc is that it determines the distribution of matter in the disc .",
    "the manner in which viscosity redistributes an annulus of matter in a keplerian flow around an accretor is very well known , with the inner region of this disc system drifting in because of dissipation , and consequently , through the conservation of angular momentum and its outward transport , making it necessary for the outer regions of the matter distribution to spread even further outwards  @xcite .",
    "this state of affairs is qualitatively not altered in anyway for the quasi - viscous flow , except for the fact that with viscosity being very weak in this case , the outward transport of angular momentum can be conspicuous only on very large scales .",
    "it may rightly be conjectured that the instability that develops on the large subsonic scales of a quasi - viscous disc is intimately connected with the cumulative transfer of angular momentum on these very length scales .",
    "the accumulation of angular momentum in this region may create an abrupt centrifugal barrier against any further smooth inflow of matter .",
    "this adverse effect , on the other hand , could disappear if there should be some other means of transporting angular momentum from the inner regions of the disc .",
    "astrophysical jets could readily afford such a means , insofar as jets actually cause a physical drift of angular momentum vertically away from the plane of the disc , instead of along it .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
    "the authors express their indebtedness to rajaram nityananda and paul j. wiita for some helpful comments ."
