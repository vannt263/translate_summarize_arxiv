    "in this paper , we consider the following eigenvalue problem @xmath3 in a bounded domain @xmath4 in @xmath5 with suitable boundary conditions , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the lebesgue measure of @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath8 , then ( [ k ] ) immediately implies @xmath9    under these settings , we consider the following problem :    [ prob - rho - abst ] find @xmath10 which attains the supremum or the infimum of the first eigenvalue @xmath11 on @xmath12 under suitable boundary condition .",
    "if it exists , characterize the shape of the domain @xmath13 .",
    "we shall call the smallest positive eigenvalue the first eigenvalue , since we consider this problem under dirichlet , neumann or mixed boundary condition .",
    "our motivation for the above problem is as follows .",
    "assume that two different materials are in a given domain @xmath4 with fixed volume ratio .",
    "how do we arrange such materials to optimize the heat conductivity of @xmath4 ?",
    "since the long - time behaviour of heat transfer of the heat equation is controlled by the first eigenvalue of @xmath14 , we may consider problem [ prob - rho - abst ] as one of toy models of this problem .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically study the eigenvalue optimization for ( [ ev - prob - rho ] ) and we observe the following results for problem [ prob - rho - abst ] :    1 .",
    "the element @xmath10 optimizing @xmath11 can be characterized by inequalities with respect to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the eigenfunction associated with @xmath17 of ( [ ev - prob - rho ] ) . as a consequence , the domain @xmath13 is given by the super- or the sub - level set of @xmath18",
    ". this characterization is independent of topology and geometry of @xmath4 and boundary conditions on @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath4 is star - shaped and symmetric in a certain direction , then @xmath20 has the same symmetry .",
    "optimized region @xmath20 depends continuously on a parameter of the boundary condition if the robin boundary condition is imposed .",
    "the precise statements are described in section [ section - numerical ] ( observation [ observation - criteria - heat ] - [ observation - dependence - heat ] ) with various numerical results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ section - setting ] , we provide more precise setting of our problems . a numerical method for finding optimizers",
    "we apply here , _ the level set approach _ , is also derived here . in section [ section - prior ] , numerical and mathematical known results for a well - considered problem",
    "are discussed .",
    "section [ section - numerical ] is where our main discussion is developed .",
    "we show several numerical observations about eigenvalue optimization criteria , geometry of the level set @xmath13 for the optimizer @xmath21 and continuous dependence of @xmath20 on boundary conditions .",
    "here we provide the precise setting of problem [ prob - rho - abst ] .",
    "[ prob - rho ] for @xmath22 define @xmath23 find an element @xmath10 which attains @xmath24 if it exists , characterize @xmath21 and the shape of domain @xmath13 .",
    "we also consider the same question for @xmath25 .",
    "it is mathematically known that the first eigenvalue of the linear operator @xmath26 is characterized by the rayleigh quotient ( [ ev - rho ] ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we also consider the minimization of @xmath11 as a comparison with the maximization of it .",
    "we consider the problem in the cases of various type of domains like ones with piecewise smooth boundary , non - convex or non - simply connected ones , as well as various boundary conditions ( dirichlet , neumann or mixed boundary condition ) .",
    "a well - known mathematical theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) tells us that the linear operator @xmath27 associated with ( [ ev - prob - rho ] ) possesses discrete eigenvalues @xmath28 in the case of the homogeneous dirichlet boundary value problem , @xmath29 is not an eigenvalue and hence the infimum in ( [ ev - rho ] ) is attained in @xmath30 being not identically zero .",
    "thus , in the case of dirichlet boundary value problems , we call @xmath30 admissible if and only if @xmath31 in an appropriate function space .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the homogeneous neumann boundary value problem , @xmath29 is admitted as an eigenvalue with a constant function as the eigenfunction .",
    "@xmath29 is thus the smallest eigenvalue . according to the general theory of eigenfunctions , eigenfunctions associated with @xmath11",
    "have to be orthogonal to constant functions in the inner product on @xmath32 .",
    "we thus call @xmath30 admissible , if and only if @xmath30 satisfies @xmath33 .",
    "our problem is one of typical problems called _",
    "topology optimization_. one of well - known methods for determining topology of the optimal object is the level set approach , originally developed in osher and sethian @xcite .",
    "this method provides an efficient way of describing time - evolving curves and surfaces which may undergo topological changes .",
    "osher and santosa @xcite improve the method so that it can be applied to optimization problems with one or more constraints like volume constraint .",
    "we follow their method as a numerical approach for determining optimizers in our problems . here",
    "we briefly review implementations of the level set approach discussed in @xcite .",
    "we describe a subset @xmath34 as the super - level set of a function @xmath35 , i.e.   @xmath36 then , the function @xmath2 in problem [ prob - rho ] can be represented as a function of @xmath37 , and hence @xmath38 in problem [ prob - rho ] can be also regarded as a function of @xmath37 since @xmath38 originally depends on @xmath2 .",
    "we may thus rewrite our optimization problem in the minimization problem of the following energy functional @xmath39 :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 for minimizing eigenvalues and @xmath42 for maximizing eigenvalues , @xmath43 is the lagrange multiplier and @xmath44 . here",
    ", we remark that the equation @xmath45 corresponds to the volume constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "the first variation of @xmath39 and @xmath43 can be calculated by ordinary methods .",
    "our optimization problem is then reduced to solving the gradient flow associated with @xmath39 , namely , the flow which decreases the energy @xmath39 along solutions .",
    "more precisely , our problem is reduced to the problem to solve the following evolution equation : @xmath46 in a certain function space , where @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the associated eigenfunction of @xmath50 . here",
    "we omit the detail how to obtain this system , since it is completely done by following the arguments in @xcite .    since the differentiability of the solution @xmath37 of ( [ sdf ] )",
    "may be lost during evolution of ( [ sdf ] ) , we may not construct numerical solution of ( [ sdf ] ) . to avoid this difficulty , instead of ( [ sdf ] ) , we solve @xmath51 with sufficiently small @xmath52 .",
    "then ( [ viscos ] ) is a semi - linear parabolic evolution equation , and hence the well - known explicit or implicit scheme enables us to solve this equation numerically keeping smoothness of @xmath37 during evolutions .",
    "this technique is well - known as _ viscosity vanishing method_. as for hamilton - jacobi type equations like ( [ sdf ] ) , it is known that solutions of ( [ viscos ] ) approach to those of ( [ sdf ] ) as @xmath53 in a suitable sense ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "as for eigenvalue optimization problems , there are a lot of earlier works for @xmath54 this is a generalized eigenvalue problem of the laplacian , which is , for example , well - considered for studying frequency of drums with spatially inhomogeneous density on @xmath4 .",
    "osher - sethian @xcite and osher - santosa @xcite considered ( [ ev - prob - sigma ] ) with the level set approach ( see section [ section - levelset ] ) , which has been well treated during a variety of improvements . in @xcite and many related works , the following problem is considered , which is an alternative one of problem [ prob - rho ] .",

    "similarly , if @xmath79 is the maximizer of @xmath68 in @xmath12 and @xmath80 . then , under the same assumption as minimizers , the same statements hold for @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the complement of @xmath83 .    theorem [ preceding - geom ]",
    "claims that geometric properties of @xmath78 and @xmath84 are also characterized by corresponding eigenfunctions , since @xmath78 and @xmath84 are determined by the super- or the sub - level sets of corresponding eigenfunctions . on the other hand , these researches focus on problem [ prob - sigma ] only with the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "furthermore @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are not concerned with problem [ prob - sigma ] with any other boundary condition , nor are they concerned with problem [ prob - rho ] . and",
    "we know no paper about them ( even numerically ) in the last few decades .",
    "lou and yanagida @xcite discuss an indefinite linear eigenvalue problem related to biological invasion of species .",
    "the formation of their problem is similar to problem [ prob - sigma ] with the homogeneous neumann condition , but the assumption on the weight @xmath85 is different . in @xcite , @xmath86 is assumed to be bounded with a fixed negative total weight .",
    "they consider only one - dimensional problems and prove that the global minimizer @xmath59 of the principal eigenvalue @xmath68 ( i.e.  the first eigenvalue in our arguments ) should be the specific two - valued function , which is often called bang - bang \" type .",
    "such bang - bang type weight @xmath59 is characterized by the super - level set of the eigenfunction associated with @xmath87 , which is similar to theorem [ preceding - sigma ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "chamillo , greiser , imai , kurata and onishi discuss geometries of the minimizing configuration @xmath20 for the first eigenvalue problem @xmath88 under the volume constraint ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "they prove that @xmath20 does not inherit symmetry of @xmath4 for appropriate values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 when @xmath4 is either an annulus or a dumbbell .",
    "problem [ prob - rho ] is considered by cox and lipton @xcite , conca , laurain and mahadevan @xcite , conca , mahadevan and sanz @xcite and some other related works . in @xcite ,",
    "cox and lipton study an shape optimization problem for the heat equation with the dirichlet boundary condition , which corresponds to problem [ prob - rho ] .",
    "they discuss the existence of optimal eigenvalues and optimizers .",
    "moreover , they obtain the exact optimal configuration in the one - dimensional problem . on the other hand , in conca , laurain and mahadevan @xcite and conca , mahadevan and sanz @xcite , they discuss the asymptotic expansion of the first eigenvalue @xmath91 and the asymptotic behavior of the minimized eigenvalue .",
    "they also discuss a conjecture of the optimal configuration when @xmath4 is a ball .",
    "the conjecture claims that the optimal configuration @xmath20 for the minimization problem of the first dirichlet eigenvalue is a concentric ball .",
    "however , the conjecture is disproved in @xcite . at least in two and three dimensional cases , the optimal configuration is a union of concentric annuli and a disk under a certain condition of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . on the other hand ,",
    "since all the discussions therein are based on the asymptotic expansion of eigenpairs , hence the characterization of optimal configurations remains as an open problem for large @xmath89 .",
    "we also note that the attainability of the supremum or the infimum of the first positive eigenvalue in problem [ prob - rho ] still remains open .",
    "in fact , the subset @xmath12 is not weak@xmath92-closed in @xmath93 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the supremum and the infimum of the first eigenvalue are thus attained in the weak@xmath92-closure @xmath94 of @xmath12 . in @xcite , they prove that , in problem [ prob - rho ] , @xmath95 and the similar result for supremum also holds .",
    "but there is still a possibility that @xmath96 .",
    "we finally remark that the optimizer @xmath59 in problem [ prob - sigma ] can be chosen as an element of @xmath12 under sufficient smoothness assumptions on @xmath19 and eigenfunctions .",
    "this fact is the consequence of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so far problem [ prob - rho ] is well - considered neither mathematically nor numerically , but the same level set approach as in the case of problem [ prob - sigma ] can be applied .",
    "recall that optimizers of eigenvalues are determined by stationary solutions of ( [ sdf ] ) .",
    "if @xmath37 is a stationary solution of ( [ sdf ] ) , then @xmath37 should satisfy @xmath97 on @xmath98 .",
    "moreover if @xmath37 satisfies @xmath99 on @xmath100 , then it should associate @xmath10 , which is given by @xmath101 if and only if @xmath102 , and the eigenfunction @xmath16 of ( [ ev - prob - rho ] ) with @xmath103 such that @xmath104 on @xmath100 , since @xmath105 is equal to the constant @xmath43 on @xmath100 , where @xmath106 is a constant .",
    "hence one can guess that optimizers are characterized by @xmath107 .",
    "first we study the eigenvalue problem in @xmath108 shown in figures [ fig - rho1dim-1 ] and [ fig - rho1dim-2 ] . as shown in figure [ fig - rho1dim-1 ] , the differential @xmath109 of the eigenfunction @xmath30 has discontinuities on @xmath100 and there is little hope of the correspondence between @xmath110 for optimizers and @xmath111 .",

    "this observation implies that the result of @xcite mentioned in section [ section - prior ] may also hold if c is not close to 1 .",
