    "the space - time evolution of a quantum mechanical system is governed by its schrdinger  equation and in its most complete form it is encoded in the propagator .",
    "the propagator defines the probability amplitude for a particle to move from one point of the space to another in a given time .",
    "similar to propagators in relativistic field theories , it provides a global picture of the causal structure of a quantum system which goes beyond the information contained in a single wave function .",
    "moreover , it plays the essential role in solving the probability related cauchy problem of quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "the vast literature on qm propagators , summarized e.g. in @xcite , lists mainly explicit expressions of propagators for stationary schrdinger  equations in one space dimension which are reducible to hypergeometric differential equations ( des ) or their confluent forms .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the available methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) @xcite which usually lead to much broader classes of exactly solvable schrdinger  equations with solutions in particular expressible in terms of linear combinations of hypergeometric functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from the structure of",
    "the susy induced relations between superpartner hamiltonians it is clear that via the corresponding schrdinger  equations these relations should extend to relations between the associated propagators .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to analyze these relations between susy partner propagators and to reshape them into user friendly general recipes for the construction of new propagator classes .",
    "our interest in such new exact propagators is less motivated by their mere existence or their technical subtleties , but rather it is in their applicability to concrete physical problems ( see e.g. @xcite ) and here especially to models with well - tailored new properties and to setups which up to now were not related to susy techniques at all ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in order to derive the corresponding technical tools we concentrate in this paper on the general approach which allows to establish the link between the propagators of any two susy partner hamiltonians .",
    "our main idea is the following .",
    "for a given hamiltonian @xmath0 , whose schrdinger  equation as a second order differential equation is exactly solvable , the general solutions of the schrdinger  equation of its susy partner hamiltonian @xmath1 can be explicitly constructed . knowing the relations between the solutions of the schrdinger  equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 one can expect to derive transformation operators relating the associated propagators . at a first glance",
    ", this approach seems to be technically trivial .",
    "but when one recalls that the calculation of a closed expression for a propagator is usual more difficult than the derivation of a corresponding wave function , one may expect the problem to be connected with rather nontrivial technical subtleties .",
    "moreover , if one wants to establish the explicit link between the propagators one may imagine that sometimes the problem may even become unsolvable .",
    "probably the first indication that the problem may have a solution was given by jauslin @xcite who constructed a general integral transformation scheme simultaneously for schrdinger  equations and for heat equations , but who did nt provide a discussion of convergency and divergency of the derived expressions .",
    "for the sake of convergency he applied his technique to the heat - equation - type fokker - planck equation only . in general , this result",
    "may be extended via wick rotation to propagators for schrdinger  equations of a free particle and a particle moving through transparent potentials .",
    "but the question of convergency and with it the question of solvability remains to be clarified .",
    "another indication that the problem may be solvable has been provided by refs @xcite where a similar model has been analyzed at the level of green functions of stationary schrdinger  equations . in the present paper",
    "we carefully analyze the problem along the ideas first announced in @xcite .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in the next section [ prelim ] , we briefly recall some main facts and notations from susy qm necessary for our subsequent analysis and we sketch the definition of the propagator . section [ susy-1 ] is devoted to the basic tool of our approach  the interrelation between propagators for models with partner hamiltonians which are linked by first - order susy transformations . in section [ susy - n ]",
    "we generalize these results to polynomial supersymmetry . the general technique developed in these sections",
    "is afterwards used in section [ applic ] to derive the propagators for susy partner models of `` a particle in a box '' , of the harmonic oscillator and of the free particle ( i.e. for models with transparent potentials ) .",
    "section [ conclu ] concludes the paper .",
    "the subject of our analysis will be a polynomial generalization of the simplest two - component system of witten s non - relativistic supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite described by the schrdinger  equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a diagonal super - hamiltonian consisting of the two super - partners @xmath0 and @xmath4 as components @xmath5 the interval @xmath6 may be both finite or infinite . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our consideration to a stationary setup with @xmath0 and @xmath4 not explicitly depending on time so that the evolution equation ( [ supershredinger ] ) reduces via standard substitution @xmath7 and properly chosen boundary conditions to the spectral problem @xmath8 the time evolution of the system may be described in terms of a corresponding propagator .",
