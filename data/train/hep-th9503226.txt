    "target space duality ( t - duality ) is a very surprising phenomenon in string theory .",
    "in essence , two target - spaces are dual to each other if both lead to the same string theory .",
    "the usual technical definition involves using path - integrals to sum over the space of all smooth maps from surfaces ( string world - sheets ) to target manifolds  @xcite . in this aspect",
    ", it is a quantum mechanical phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , it is natural to ask :    as already pointed out in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) , one possible answer may be the equivalence of the associated string hamiltonian systems .    as will be discussed in sec .",
    "1.3 , for the simplest known example , the @xmath6-duality for @xmath7 , the above naive picture after appropriate modification captures many features of target - space duality . backed by this example and some lessons learned from it",
    ", we next turn our attention to another known example in the physics literature @xcite . recall that the simple compact lie group @xmath8 and its associated lie algebra form a target - space dual pair when @xmath8 is endowed with a bi - invariant metric and its associated lie algebra @xmath9 is endowed with a metric and a @xmath10-field which , up to a constant multiple , are written in linear coordinates respectively as @xcite @xmath11 in terms of hamiltonian systems , the duality of this pair comes from a formal canonical transformation from the loop space @xmath12 to the loop space @xmath13 .",
    "this canonical transformation is generated by @xmath14 in coordinate - free , fundamental matrix form .",
    "the latter expression is immediately applicable for general lie groups and their associated lie algebras .",
    "this observation leads us to this present work .",
    "recently , a geometrical picture of duality  @xcite has emerged which allows one to write down the general duality transformation when there is a group action on a manifold . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the formalism of @xcite to look more closely at the example of the target being a simple compact lie group .    in brief , given a simple compact lie group @xmath0 with a bi - invariant metric , let @xmath5 be its associated lie algebra .",
    "we take the generating function @xmath1 as the foundation of our approach and work out the canonical transformation @xmath2 it generates from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "we obtain also an @xmath3-invariant metric and an @xmath3-invariant @xmath10-field ( a 2-form ) on the associated lie algebra @xmath4 so that they form a t - dual pair at the classical level under the hamiltonian formalism",
    ". this could possibly be an exact dual pair in terms of path - integrals at the quantum level . in this first paper",
    ", we focus on properties of the canonical transformation @xmath2 and the t - dual geometry on @xmath5 and leave the important issue of how exactly @xmath0 and @xmath5 form a dual pair at the quantum level to the sequel .",

    "its density function along @xmath7 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 stands for the induced metric on the fiber of @xmath25 from @xmath41 .",
    "basically all the information about the classical physics for a closed string is contained in this hamiltonian system .",
    "though the term `` _ target - space duality _ '' has become more or less official in the literature , a better name for it would be `` _ string - equivalence between target - spaces _ ''",
    "the latter says exactly the meaning hidden under the former .",

    "thus , as long as physics is concerned , one can not tell whether the particle is moving about in one or another target - space in the same equivalence class . since these correlation functions are all defined formally via feynman s path - integral",
    ", the definition indicates that target - space duality is actually a quantum level phenomenon .",
    "one would like to know _ if this phenomenon manifests itself at the classical level_.    since all the information of the classical physics for a string theory is completely contained in the string hamiltonian system described in sec .",
    "1.1 , a naive guess for the classical remnant of target - space duality is the equivalence of string hamiltonian systems",
    ". this equivalence would be given by a canonical transformations between string phase spaces that take the string hamiltonian function on one phase space to that on another .",
    "in the next section we shall do a redemonstration of a known example where the target space is a circle .",
    "the classical remnant of target space duality with be a classical hamiltonian equivalence except that the respective phase spaces have to be restricted . in this example `` classical duality '' only exists between _ reduced hamiltonian systems_. this may be a general feature of target space duality .",
    "namely , its classical remnant is a reduced hamiltonian system though a general rule for this classical reduction is not known yet .    in this paper",
    "we will explore these issues for the case of a @xmath51 pair .",
    "the @xmath7-target case is the simplest and best known example of target - space duality .",
    "it indicates a new relation between physics in the small scale and physics in the large scale",

    "let @xmath59 be a loop in @xmath56 .",
    "then the value of the hamiltonian function at @xmath27 is given by @xmath60 with @xmath61 the hamiltonian vector field @xmath62 on @xmath54 associated to @xmath63 can be computed straightforwardly .",

    "unfortunately , as we shall see , this natural candidate for the sought canonical transformation is not extendable to the whole phase space .",
