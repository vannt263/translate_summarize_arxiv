    "in general terms , the group of massive compact objects is defined in astrophysics to contain black holes , neutron stars , white dwarfs , planet - like compact objects , and other exotic dense stars .",
    "the main common characteristic of compact objects is that they are small for their mass . in the case of weak gravitational fields ,",
    "newtonian gravity provides an adequate physical description of compact objects .",
    "however , for the study of very massive objects like black holes and neutron stars it is necessary to take into account relativistic effects .",
    "moreover , exotic objects like pulsars and quasars can be investigated only in the framework of relativistic astrophysics .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of modern navigation techniques made it necessary to take into account relativistic effects of the gravitational field of the earth and other planets of the solar system .    in general relativity , the gravitational field of compact objects must be described by a metric satisfying einstein s equations r _ - g_r = 8 t _  , in the interior part of the object ( @xmath1 ) as well as outside in empty space @xmath2 ) . since at the classical level",
    "the most important sources of gravity are the mass and charge distributions , it is clear that the problem of finding a metric that describes the gravitational field of compact objects can be divided into four related problems .",
    "the first one consists in finding an exact vacuum solution @xmath3 ) that describes the field corresponding to the mass distribution .",
    "secondly , the charge distribution must be considered by solving the electrovacuum field equations r_= 8 ( f_f^  _ - g _ f _ f^ )  , where @xmath4 is the faraday tensor corresponding to a charge distribution @xmath5 . as for the interior region , it is necessary to propose a model to describe the internal gravitational structure of the object .",

    "p  , [ pf ] with density @xmath6 , pressure @xmath7 , and 4-velocity @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the fourth part of the problem consists in considering the mass and charge distribution simultaneously , i.e. one needs an exact solution to the equations r _ - g_r = 8 t _ ( , p , q )  , where a specific model must be proposed for the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "each of the above problems is very difficult to solve because einstein s field equations are highly non - linear . to overcome in part these difficulties",
    "it is necessary to assume that the gravitational field is invariant with respect to certain transformations . in particular",
    ", one can assume that the field is stationary and axially symmetric , conditions that are in good agreement with observations .",
    "in fact , compact objects show in general a rotation that is constant over quite long periods of time , and their shape deviates only slightly from spherical symmetry .    in this work",
    ", we review a family of electrovacuum solutions that describe the exterior gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a rotating compact object .",
    "this represents a solution to the first two problems mentioned above .",
    "it turns out that in the limit of a weak gravitational field , a particular solution of this family can be matched smoothly with an interior approximate solution .",
    "this opens the possibility of searching for an exact interior solution that could be matched with the exact exterior solution . as a particular example",
    ", we consider the case of a static mass with quadrupole moment , and search for a physically meaningful interior solution .",
    "the problem of matching the solutions arises immediately .",
    "it is generally accepted that to match an interior and an exterior solution one first should determine a matching surface @xmath9 .",
    "if the metrics and their second order derivatives coincide on @xmath9 , the matching is reached in the sense that the curvature of the interior spacetime region passes smoothly into the exterior region .",
    "this can be considered as a @xmath10matching . in this procedure",
    ", however , the determination of @xmath9 remains unclear . in the investigation of the example of an interior solution with quadrupole moment reported in this work",
    ", we noticed that at certain distance from the origin of coordinates the curvature eigenvalues present a non - expected behavior in the sense that they change their sign several times passing through points of maximum and minimum local curvature .",
    "this behavior could be associated with the existence of a repulsive gravitational potential .",
    "it then seems plausible that to avoid repulsive gravity one can cover the region of repulsion with an interior solution .",
    "the location of @xmath9 can then be anywhere outside the region of repulsion that , in turn , can be invariantly defined in terms of the derivatives of the curvature eigenvalues .",

    ", we consider here only the simplest case with @xmath86const so that the pressure @xmath87 must be determined by the field equations .",
    "then , in the limiting case of a non - rotating object the total mass is @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the radius of the body . under these conditions",

    "it can be shown that the interior solution ( [ h1 ] ) can be matched smoothly on the surface @xmath96 with the exterior solution ( [ ht1 ] ) in the special case of an unperturbed configuration with @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the radius of the non - rotating configuration . in the general case of a rotating deformed body , the matching can be performed only numerically .",
    "in fact , the solutions of the field equations for the inner distribution of mass are calculated using the matching conditions as boundary conditions . in this manner , it is possible to find realistic solutions that describe the interior and exterior gravitational field of slowly rotating and slightly deformed mass distributions .",
    "several examples of this procedure were originally presented by hartle and thorne @xcite .",
    "the above result shows that in the case of a slowly and rigidly rotating compact object that slightly deviates from spherical symmetry , the solution presented here is physically meaningful and determines a well - defined manifold in the entire spacetime .",
    "we interpret this result as a strong indication that in general the solution ( [ epot ] ) describes the exterior gravitational field of rotating astrophysical compact bodies with arbitrary sets of gravitational and electromagnetic multipole moments .",
    "rather few exact stationary solutions that involve a matter distribution in rotation are to be found in the literature . in particular , the interior solution for the rotating kerr solution is still unknown .",
    "in fact , the quest for a realistic exact solution , representing both the interior and exterior gravitational field generated by a self - gravitating axisymmetric distribution of a perfect fluid mass in stationary rotation is considered as a major problem in general relativity .",
    "we believe that the inclusion of a quadrupole in the exterior and in the interior solutions adds a new physical degree of freedom that could be used to search for realistic interior solutions",
    ". we will study in this section the entire riemannian manifold corresponding to the simple case of a static exterior solution with only quadrupole moment .",
    "the simplest generalization of the schwarzschild spacetime which includes a quadrupole parameter can be obtained from the zipoy ",

    "the corresponding line element in spherical - like coordinates can be represented as ds^2 = & & ( 1-)^1-q dt^2 + & - & ( 1-)^q . [ zv ]    this solution is axially symmetric and reduces to the spherically symmetric schwarzschild metric in the limit @xmath101 .",
    "it is asymptotically flat for any finite values of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",

    "this means that , independently of the value of @xmath48 , there exists a coordinate transformation that transforms the resulting metric into the minkowski solution . from a physical point of view",

    "this means that the arbitrary parameters @xmath46 and @xmath48 determine the mass and quadrupole which are the only independent multipole moments of the solution . in the limiting case",
    "@xmath51 only the monopole @xmath105 survives , as in the schwarzschild spacetime . in the limit @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , all moments vanish identically , implying that no mass distribution is present and the spacetime must be flat .",
    "this is in accordance with the result mentioned above for the metric ( [ zv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , notice that all odd multipole moments are zero because the solution possesses an additional reflection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",
