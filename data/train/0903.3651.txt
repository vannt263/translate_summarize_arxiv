    "game theoretical problems dealing with conflict of interest have been tackled in the recent past with quantum approaches @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that quantum game theory , by exploiting quantum mechanics , would produce significantly improved solutions . of particular interest is how many - particle quantum entanglement can be harnessed to provide better strategies ( in games ) compared to the classical solutions .",
    "entanglement , which provides correlations between remote particles , can equip the players with a coordinated set of actions depending on the state of the particle that they privately observe .",
    "thus when players can not communicate by classical channels , they can still arrive at an optimal strategy .",
    "quantum non - locality was first demonstrated by bell with his famous inequalities @xcite .",
    "quantum theory predicts correlations among outcomes of distant measurements which can not be explained using only local variables .",
    "it has been demonstrated that two photons are correlated over large distances ( of the order of 10 km ) thereby violating bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "thus we have a verification of the basic assumption of quantum information and computation that quantum systems can be entangled over large distances and times .    in the past quantum entanglement",
    "has been incorporated in classical two - party games such as the prisoner s dilemma by eisert _",
    "@xcite , the battle of sexes by marinatto and weber @xcite , etc .",
    "these authors demonstrated how optimal solutions can be achieved using entanglement .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to propose many - particle entangled states and show how they can be used to obtain improved / optimal solutions for classical problems requiring coordinated action by the players .",
    "in condensed matter systems one frequently encounters bands filled with fermions . based on pauli s exclusion principle ,",
    "the ground state of any @xmath0-state band filled completely by @xmath0 spinless - fermions is a slater determinant of the complete set of @xmath0 single particle eigen states of the band .",
    "such a slater determinant is an antisymmetric linear superposition of @xmath1-many @xmath0-particle eigen states . here _",
    "we consider a case of a degenerate filled band  the integer quantum hall state at filling factor 1_.    in our quantum hall state , electrons are chosen to be confined to the xy - plane and subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field . on choosing a symmetric gauge vector potential , @xmath2 , the degenerate single - particle wavefunctions for the lowest landau level ( lll ) are given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron position in complex plane , @xmath5 is the orbital angular momentum , and @xmath6 is the magnetic length .",
    "the area occupied by the electron in state @xmath7 is @xmath8 thus the lll can accommodate only @xmath9 electrons given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the area of the system and @xmath12 is the largest allowed angular momentum for area @xmath11 .",
    "the many - electron system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 ^2 + \\sum_{j < k } \\frac{e^2}{|z_j - z_k | } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   +   g \\mu_b \\sum_j   \\vec{b } \\cdot \\vec{s}_j .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus when the lll ( with the lowest zeeman energy ) is completely filled with @xmath9 electrons ( i.e. , when lll is at filling factor @xmath14 ) , the many - particle wavefunction @xmath15 is given by the slater determinant @xmath16 the many - particle wavefunction @xmath15 for @xmath9 particles can be expressed as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the set of permutations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 denotes the signature of the permutation @xmath22 .",
    "thus we see that @xmath23 is a linear superposition of @xmath24 states ( all with the same probability of being observed ) and each state @xmath25 has the angular momenta @xmath26 distributed among @xmath9 fermionic particles ( at positions @xmath27 ) in a uniquely different way ( with no two particles having the same angular momentum ) ! thus if the many - particle wavefunction @xmath15 is measured for angular momentum of its particles ( using for instance a stern - gerlach type of set - up ) at positions @xmath27 , then one of the @xmath24 permutations of the angular momentum from the set @xmath28 will be measured with probability @xmath29 .",
    "the above fact can be exploited in a game - theoretic context as described in the next section .    here",
    "it should be pointed out that although an antisymmetric wavefunction obtained based on pauli s exclusion principle is in general not an entangled state @xcite , the coulomb interactions actually produce the same antisymmetric wavefunction even when the fermionic nature of the particles is ignored , i.e. , for example if the particles are treated as classical particles . furthermore , for the situation where the g - factor is zero ( which can be achieved in gallium arsenide heterostructures using pressure ) ,",
    "coulomb interaction energy is minimized when the real space wave function is antisymmetric and given by eq .",
    "( [ wf1 ] ) while the spin wavefunction is symmetric ( with the total spin being maximized and equal to @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is clearly an entangled state based on correlation effects .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of the electronic wavefunction in a half - filled degenerate sub - shell in an atom ( such as the five electrons in the 3d sub - shell of @xmath31 ) where hund s rule dictates that wavefunction be antisymmetric in the real space and symmetric in the spin space . in general , for the quantum hall situation ( at filling factor 1 ) where one has at least two species of fermionic particles with all the particles having the same charge , spin , and single particle energy ( @xmath32 ) , one again obtains [ for total number of particles @xmath33 ) ] the same many - body wavefunction [ given by eq .",
    "( [ wf1 ] ) ] which now is certainly entangled due to correlation effects produced by coulomb interactions .",
    "lastly , we would like to add that , the above considerations for minimum coulomb interaction energy are certainly valid when the repulsive interaction is given by a short range dirac - delta function in which case the interaction energy is zero .",
    "in this section we will pose a couple of classical problems and show that entanglement not only significantly improves the solution , in fact , it also produces the best possible solution .",
    "we will first examine the kolkata restaurant problem ( krp ) @xcite which is a variant of the minority game problem @xcite . in the krp ( in its minimal form )",
    "there are @xmath0 restaurants ( with @xmath34 ) that can each accommodate only one person and there are @xmath0 agents to be accommodated .",
    "all the @xmath0 agents take a stochastic strategy that is independent of each other . if we assume that , on any day , each of the @xmath0 agents chooses randomly any of the @xmath0 restaurants such that if @xmath5 ( @xmath35 ) agents show up at any restaurant , then only one of them ( picked randomly ) will be served and the rest @xmath36 go without a meal .",
    "it is also understood that each agent can choose only one restaurant and no more .",
    "then the probability @xmath37 that a person gets a meal ( or a restaurant gets a customer ) on any day is calculated based on the probability @xmath38 that any restaurant gets chosen by @xmath5 agents with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability of choosing any restaurant .",
    "hence , the fraction of restaurants that get chosen on any day is given by @xmath41    now , we extend the above minimal krp game to get a more efficient utilization of restaurants by taking advantage of past experience of the diners .",
    "we stipulate that the successful diners ( @xmath42 ) on the @xmath43th day will visit the same restaurant on all subsequent days as well , while the remaining @xmath44 unsuccessful agents of the @xmath43th day try stochastically any of the @xmath0 restaurants on the next day ( i.e. , @xmath45th day ) and so on until all customers find a restaurant .",
    "the above procedure can be mathematically modeled to yield the following recurrence relation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fraction of restaurants occupied on the @xmath43th day with @xmath48 . upon making a continuum approximation",
    "we get @xmath49 which yields the solution @xmath50 the above solution @xmath51 turns out to be a good approximation to the solution for @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ f_n ] ) ( with error less than 5% ) as can be seen from fig .",
    "we see that even after 10 iterations less than 90% of the restaurants are filled !      we will now investigate how superior quantum solutions can be obtained for the krp .",
    "we will introduce quantum mechanics into the problem by asking the @xmath0 agents to share an entangled @xmath0-particle quantum hall state at filling factor 1 described in the previous section [ see eqs .",
    "( [ wf1 ] ) & ( [ wf2 ] ) ] .",
    "we assign to each of the @xmath0 restaurants a unique angular momentum picked from the set @xmath52 .",
    "we ask each agent to measure the angular momentum of a randomly chosen particle from the @xmath0-particle entangled state .",
    "then , based on the measured angular momentum , the agent goes to the restaurant that has his / her particular angular momentum assigned to it . in this approach",
    "all the agents get to eat in a restaurant and all the restaurants get a customer .",
    "thus we see that the prescribed entangled state always produces restaurant - occupation probability 1 and is thus superior to the classical solution mentioned above !",
    "furthermore , the probability that an agent picks a restaurant is still @xmath40 and hence all agents are equally likely to go to any restaurant .",
    "thus , even if there is an accepted - by - all hierarchy amongst the restaurants ( in terms of quality of food with price of all restaurants being the same ) , the entangled state produces an equitable ( pareto optimal ) solution where all agents have the same probability of going to the best restaurant , or the second - best restaurant , and so on .",
    "_ quite importantly , it can be shown that the chosen entangled quantum strategy ( i.e. , the entangled @xmath0-particle quantum hall state at filling factor 1 ) actually represents the best nash equilibrium when there is a restaurant ranking ! _ ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "we will next introduce a variant of the krp game which we will call as the kolkata stadium problem ( ksp ) . in the ksp",
    ", there are @xmath53 agents trapped inside a kolkata stadium that has @xmath54 exits .",
    "there is a panic situation of a fire or a bomb - scare and all the agents have to get out quickly through the @xmath54 exits each of which has a capacity of @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that all @xmath53 agents have equal access to all the exits and that each agent has enough time to approach only one exit before being harmed .",
    "the probability @xmath38 that any exit gets chosen by @xmath5 agents is given by the binomial distribution @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the probability of choosing any gate .",
    "for a capacity of @xmath55 for each gate , the cumulative probability @xmath59 that ( on an average ) a gate is approached by @xmath55 or less agents is given in table [ table1 ] .       here",
    "we use the formalism developed in ref . .",
    "we assume that diners @xmath61 have access to the following entangled state : @xmath62 where the coefficients satisfy the condition @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding initial density matrix is given by @xmath64 or the pauli flipping operator @xmath65 which is unitary and has the following property @xmath66 we further assume that each diner can transform his part ( @xmath67 ) of the total density matrix @xmath68 in the following manner : @xmath69 to obtain the final density matrix @xmath70 in order to evaluate the payoff , we define the payoff operator as follows : @xmath71 then the payoffs obtained using the following expression @xmath72 are given by @xmath73 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ ! - 0.5   p_2 \\left [   u_1 |b|^2 +   u_2 |a|^2 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "] to determine the nash equilibria , we stipulate that the following differences be non - negative : @xmath75 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{diff1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath76 .",
    "\\label{diff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , from eqs .",

    ". it can easily be verified , for the third nash equilibrium strategy , that @xmath87 .",
    "thus the entangled state @xmath88 , that one expects the best nash equilibrium to occur when @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ psi_in ] ) .",
