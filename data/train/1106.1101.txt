    "the direct detection and characterization of exoplanets around young a - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have demonstrated that planets with several jupiter masses can form in a broad range of orbital separations providing important constraints on planet formation processes .",
    "understanding the formation of planets in more detail requires a solid knowledge of the geometrical , physical and chemical parameters of the circumstellar disks in which planets are thought to form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to study these planet - forming disks by means of direct imaging in the near - infrared requires high contrast techniques that sufficiently suppress the stellar light and , in case of ground - based observations , minimize the residual speckle noise caused by uncorrected aberrations in the wavefront . a powerful technique to achieve this is polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that takes advantage of the fact that the direct stellar light is essentially unpolarized whereas scattered light from dust grains in the surface layer of a circumstellar disk is polarized ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the past , this technique has been successfully applied to study the circumstellar disks around young massive stars @xcite , intermediate mass herbig ae / be stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the ttauri star tw hya @xcite and some debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "polarimetry from space with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has the advantage of a more stable point spread function ( psf ) and a higher surface brightness sensitivity compared to ground - based facilities and the disk structure and dust grain properties have been investigated for some selected objects ( e.g. , au mic and ab aur ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although most of the studies mentioned above had to cope with technical or observational limitations , such as the use of a coronagraph ( which often reduces significantly the accessible inner working angles around the star ) , a rather modest telescope size or only single filter images , they provided valuable scientific insights for the observed targets .    in this paper , we present the first pdi study of the transition disk around the well - studied herbig be star hd100546 ( see , table  [ parameters ] for stellar parameters ) .",
    "the circumstellar environment of this object has been intensively studied by previous imaging campaigns using direct imaging from the ground ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6 and @xmath7 band ) and from space with _",
    "hst nicmos _",
    "( 1.6@xmath8 m ) , _ stis _ , and _ acs _ ( f435w , f606w , f814w ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scattered light images across optical and nir wavelengths of the latter studies revealed a complex circumstellar structure interpreted as a large disk ( @xmath9 au ) and a remnant envelope .",
    "emission at 10@xmath8 m possibly probing the warmer dust layers of the circumstellar disk has been spatially resolved on tens of au scales by means of mid - infrared ( mir ) interferometry @xcite .",
    "mir spectroscopy studying the emission features of heated dust grains on the disk surface hinted towards noticeable dust processing , i.e. , a significant amount of crystalline grains and comparatively large grains @xcite .",
    "in particular , the resemblance of the mir spectrum to that of the comet hale bopp @xcite led to the conclusion that dust processing similar to that in our own solar system must have taken place @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to account for a deficit in the nir excess compared to the strong mir excess emission , @xcite suggested the presence of an inner cavity with a radius of 10 au in order to fit the spectral energy distribution .",
    "these authors speculated that a giant planet orbiting at roughly 10 au may have opened such a gap .",
    "an inner cavity was further supported by fuv long slit spectroscopy using _ hst / stis _ @xcite and spatially resolved echelle spectroscopy of the [ oi ] 630 nm emission line @xcite .",
    "the latter authors argued that temporal changes in their [ oi ] line profile may be another signpost for the existence of the yet unseen massive planet orbiting within the cavity . from rovibrational co emission lines",
    "@xcite found further evidence for an inner cavity ( @xmath213 au radius ) existing not only in the dust but also in the gaseous component of the disk ( at least in co ) .",
    "qualitatively the same was found by @xcite although these authors could only put a lower limit of 8 au on the inner radius of the co emission region .",
    "@xcite used co emission lines in the ( sub-)mm to constrain the mass , kinematics and outer radius of the molecular gas and found that more than 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 of molecular gas is present in a keplerian disk with an outer radius of @xmath2400 au . a wealth of additional molecular lines ( e.g. , co , oh ) as well as a 69 @xmath8 m silicate feature was found in data taken with the _ pacs _ instrument onboard the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "currently , the most sophisticated model of the hd100546 system was presented by @xcite who inferred the existence of an additional inner disk from @xmath7-band interferometry data . these authors model the sed and the nir / mir visibilities with a tenuous inner disk component ( reaching from @xmath20.34 au ) consisting of micron - sized grains , a gap ( stretching from @xmath2413 au ) and a massive optically thick main disk ( @xmath213350 au ) .",
    "a sketch of the basic disk geometry is shown in figure  [ disk_sketch ] .",
    "in this model , most of the disk mass is contained in the main disk comprised of mostly large dust grains ( 1 @xmath8 m to 10 mm ) , but a population of small grains ( 0.05 to 1 @xmath8 m ) is also required on the disk surface at a few tens of au to account for the mir and fir excess emission .",
    "using pdi on an 8 m class , ao - assisted telescope in two infrared filters ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) without any occulting mask , our images allow us to analyze disk regions with unprecedented spatial resolution and small inner working angle ( @xmath20.1@xmath3 to the central star ) which are difficult to probe with other direct imaging techniques .",
    "not only are we able to probe the disk geometry and structure but we can also put new constraints on the dust grain properties on the disk surface between @xmath215140 au . in section  [ observationssection ] , we describe the observations . the data reduction is explained in detail in section  [ datareductionsection ] .",
    "the key results are presented in section  [ resultssection ] and analyzed in a broader context in section  [ analysissection ] .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings in section  [ discussionsection ] and summarize and conclude in section  [ summaryconclusionsection ] .",
    "the observations were carried out on april 7 , 2006 , with the ao - assisted , high resolution nir camera naco @xcite mounted on ut4 at the vlt .",
    "the observing conditions were photometric .",
    "we used the sl27 camera with a pixel scale of 27 mas / pixel and the detector was set to highdynamic mode and read out in double rdrstrd mode .",
    "naco is equipped with a polarimetric focal plane mask , a rotatable half - wave retarder plate , and a wollaston prism which can be inserted into the light path for imaging polarimetry .",
    "the wollaston splits the @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarization into the ordinary and extraordinary beam offset by 3.5@xmath3 in @xmath14-direction on the detector .",
    "overlap of the two images is avoided by the polarimetric mask which restricts the original field of view of  27@xmath1527@xmath3 to @xmath16 long and @xmath17 wide stripes separated by 3.5@xmath3 in @xmath14-direction . for linear polarization measurements",
    "different polarization directions can be selected with the rotatable half - wave plate .",
    "one full polarization cycle includes observations in four different retarder plate positions ( @xmath18 ) . to correct for bad pixels we moved the object along the detector s @xmath19-axis between consecutive polarization cycles . in total , we observed hd100546 in four different filters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . while we saturated the core of the psf in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter",
    "so that the innermost 5 - 6 pixels ( in diameter ) were no longer in the linear detector regime ( i.e. @xmath2210000 counts ) , the images in the narrow band filters were never saturated and only individual frames showed count rates slightly above the linearity threshold .",
    "the fwhm of the psf in the narrow band filters was typically 4.0 - 4.5 pixels wide .",
    "in addition to hd100546 , we also observed the main sequence star hd106797 as a reference star in the two broadband filters to check the validity of our data reduction process .",
    "the same star was already used as a psf reference star for hd100546 by @xcite . in the meantime",
    ", however , @xcite detected a hot debris disk around hd106797 based on mid - infrared observations with the akari satellite making this object no longer an ideal reference source and we would pick a different object next time .",
    "while table  [ parameters ] summarizes the basic parameters of the two objects table  [ observations ] provides a detailed summary of the observations and the observing conditions .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using self - written idl ",
    "scripts unless otherwise described .",
    "each exposure was first dark and flatfield corrected and then cleaned for bad pixels using a 3-@xmath23 filtering process that replaces the central pixel of a 5@xmath245 pixel box with the mean of the other pixels .",
    "dither positions where the ao correction was poor ( e.g. , due to an open loop ) were disregarded from any further analysis ( see table  [ observations ] ) .",
    "afterwards , the ordinary and extraordinary image in each exposure was cut out and all images of each filter ( i.e. , all dither positions , all rotation angles ) were aligned to one reference images that was chosen to be the first image of the series . as pointed out by previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the alignment of the images has to be done with sub - pixel accuracy in order to avoid the introduction of any spurious features and to effectively suppress the unpolarized light from the central star . for the alignment , we used the idl - based program idp3 that was initially developed for _ hst _ imaging data @xcite . to determine the centroid of each individual image",
    ", a two - dimensional gaussian was fitted to the psf over a 20-pixel radius .",
    "the shifting onto the reference image was carried out using `` bicubic sinc '' interpolation .",
    "once all images were aligned , we flagged those regions in the individual images where the count rates exceeded the linear regime , i.e. , @xmath2510000 counts in this detector read - out mode .",
    "this way , in the final images at the end of the data reduction process non - linear pixels are flagged and disregarded in the analyses .",
    "we measured the fractional stokes parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 using double ratios as described in detail in @xcite or as applied in the polarimetric analysis of planets by @xcite .",
    "from the two exposures taken with retarder position @xmath28 and @xmath29 we derive @xmath30 .",
    "this rotation of the retarder plate allows to swap the two polarization images in the two wollaston beams so that differential effects cancel out .",
    "first , we derive @xmath31 here , the superscript denotes the rotation angle of the retarder plate , while the subscript denotes either the ordinary or the extraordinary beam . by first dividing the ordinary images by the extraordinary images for a given retarder position ,",
    "all time dependent factors such as atmospheric transmission and seeing are cancelled out as these images were taken simultaneously .",
    "then , by dividing the ratios of the different retarder positions , all polarization influencing factors such as reflection coefficients of mirrors or individual pixel sensitivities are cancelled out . the fractional polarization @xmath32 is derived via @xmath33 since @xmath34 denotes the flux measured for the stokes q parameter and @xmath35 refers to the total intensity of the object ( i.e. , all counts summed up : @xmath36 ) , @xmath30 can be expressed in units of `` percent '' or simply as a fraction . using the images taken at the other retarder plate positions ( -22.5@xmath37 and -67.5@xmath37 ) the fractional polarization for the @xmath38 component , @xmath39 , is derived similarly .",
    "we computed @xmath30 and @xmath39 for each dither position individually . afterwards",
    "the resulting images are averaged to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the final image .",
    "the total fractional polarization @xmath40 is derived from the final @xmath30 and @xmath39 images via @xmath41    to compute the individual stokes components @xmath34 and @xmath38 for each dither position we also applied the double difference approach as presented in @xcite : @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 again , the superscript denotes the rotation angle of the retarder plate , while the subscript denotes either the ordinary or the extraordinary beam .",
    "we refer the reader to the aforementioned paper for a detailed discussion of this method and its advantages .",
    "the stokes @xmath38 component is obtained in the same way using the images with rotation angles of -22.5@xmath37 and -67.5@xmath37 .",
    "finally , the images from each dither position were averaged to increase the s / n of the final @xmath34 and @xmath38 images .",
    "the intensity of the polarization ( i.e. , the total polarized flux ) is obtained from the final images via @xmath45      being a nasmyth instrument and never optimally designed for polarimetry , naco suffers from significant instrumental polarization effects .",
    "unfortunately , the instrumental polarization changes whenever the positions of reflecting surfaces in the light path change relative to each other ( i.e. , due to different telescope pointing , different rotation angle of the camera , etc . ) .",
    "these effects have been investigated by @xcite for the @xmath7-band . according to this",
    "study the introduced polarization is about @xmath46 for the telescope and @xmath47 for naos , while the @xmath48 cross talk between linear and circular polarization in naos can reduce the @xmath38-polarization flux by up to 15  % . in this sense",
    "the measured @xmath38 fluxes should be regarded as lower limits . at the time of our observations",
    "the polarimetric characteristics of vlt / naco were not known . for this reason we have chosen a calibration approach which uses the central source as zero point polarization reference to estimate the amount of instrumental polarization for each data set .",
    "a detailed description is provided in appendix a.      it turned out that for data taken before fall 2009 the retarder plate position values saved in the image headers were off by @xmath213.2@xmath37 compared to the actual angular positions on the sky due to a bug in the encoder positions @xcite .",
    "this angular offset had to be subtracted from the camera positions saved in the image headers to obtain the correct orientation of the measured polarization direction on the sky ( see , table  [ observations ] ) . since we chose to align the disk major axis as observed with _",
    "@xcite with the x - axis of the detector in the @xmath0 band compared to the other filters so that the disk minor axis was aligned along the detector s x - axis . ]",
    "the positive @xmath34 component is not aligned in north - south direction in our final images as it is the usual convention .",
    "the photometric calibration was based on the unsaturated images in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters because the images in the broadband filters were saturated as described above . for all dark , flatfield and bad",
    "pixel corrected images we cut out the @xmath219.8@xmath49 sub - images of the detector that contained either the ordinary ( @xmath50 ) or the extraordinary image ( @xmath51 ) of the star .",
    "the size of the sub - images along the x - axis was chosen so that the edges of the detector , where dark and white fringes were apparent , were excluded ( @xmath23.5@xmath3 on both sides ) .",
    "the size along the y - axis was determined by the size of the wollaston mask .",
    "we computed and subtracted the local sky background in the individual sub - images .",
    "the remaining count rates in the sub - images were then regarded as the photometric signal from hd100564 .    to estimate the total intensity of the object we summed up the contribution from ordinary and extraordinary sub - images , i.e. , @xmath52 , for each retarder plate and dither position and computed the mean value . for this",
    "we found approximately @xmath53@xmath24@xmath54 counts and @xmath55@xmath24@xmath54 counts in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filter , respectively .",
    "the errors are the standard deviation of the mean ( @xmath20.8% and @xmath21.0% , in the respective filters ) . using the transmission curves of the filters we calculated that the @xmath20 filter has a transmission of only @xmath23.4% relative to the @xmath0 band filter . between the @xmath21 and the @xmath1 filter this",
    "fraction amounts to @xmath213.2% . taking these factors into account as well as the different integration times between the filters ( table  [ observations ] ) we could estimate the expected count rates for the broadband filters .",
    "this intrinsically assumes that hd100546 has the same magnitude in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filter as in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter , respectively ( see , table  [ parameters ] ) .",
    "knowing now the count rates in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters and the respective magnitudes we can derive the zero point from @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the count rate and @xmath58 being the zero point . with the zero points we can then convert the count rates in each pixel in the final images to magnitudes using again equation  ( [ magnitude_equation ] ) above , and , finally , we can convert the magnitudes into surface brightness @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 equals the square of the pixel scale ( given in arcsec pixel@xmath61 ) of the camera .",
    "taking into account all the different sources of uncertainties and errors as described in this and the previous sub - section , some of which are difficult to quantify exactly , we estimate that the absolute flux calibration of the final polarized flux images @xmath62 is only good to 30 - 40% .",
    "the main uncertainty arises from the correction of the instrumental polarization .",
    "in figures  [ h_images ] and [ ks_images ] we present the final stokes @xmath34 and @xmath38 images and the final @xmath30 and @xmath39 images in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter , respectively . a `` butterfly '' pattern90@xmath37 . from equations",
    "( 4)(6 ) it is clear that _ both _ the bright and the dark lobes contain a polarization signal because we are looking at a difference image . ]",
    "is apparent in all the images which we interpret as polarized emission coming from light that was scattered on dust grains on the surface layer of the circumstellar disk surrounding hd100546 .",
    "such a pattern is a manifestation of tangential polarization vectors and similar images have been obtained for other sources , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite . in appendix",
    "b we provide an estimate for the typical signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of our images showing that the observed features are real .    in our data ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath0 and @xmath1 are qualitatively very similar and , as expected , the pattern in the @xmath38 images is rotated by roughly 45@xmath37 compared to the @xmath34 images . in figure  [ nb_images ]",
    "we show the final stokes @xmath34 images taken in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filter .",
    "again , the observed butterfly pattern is similar to those obtained with the broadband filters , but due to shorter total integration times and a more narrow bandwidth of the filters the s / n in these images is lower .",
    "this explains why the polarization pattern can not be traced to the same angular separation from the central star as in figures  [ h_images ] and  [ ks_images ] . since our main analyses are based on the higher s / n broadband images we do not show and analyze the complete set of the images obtained in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 filters and mention only that the observed structures agree very well .",
    "figure  [ reference_images ] is identical with figure  [ ks_images ] but shows the results for the reference star hd106797 .",
    "no strong and consistent polarization pattern is apparent as most prominently seen in the @xmath30 and @xmath39 images .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ observationssection ] , @xcite found that hd106797 is surrounded by a hot debris disk .",
    "they estimated the inner radius to be @xmath214 au and put an upper limit of 41 au for the outer radius .",
    "thus , theoretically , we could have resolved this disk with our observations as hd106797 and hd100546 are at the same distance .",
    "however , the hd106797 debris disk has so far only been detected at thermal infrared wavelengths .",
    "no scattered light images in the optical or nir exist .",
    "thus , given what is known about this source , it is impossible to estimate by what factor the polarized flux potentially coming from the debris disk is below our detection limits .",
    "however , as there are a lot of examples where bright debris disks were not detected in scattered light even with _ hst _ @xcite and taking into account",
    "that only a fraction of the scattered light will be polarized , it seems seems not surprising that the hd106797 debris disk is not detected in our data .",
    "thus , we are convinced that our data reduction process works correct and does not introduce any spurious features ( see also , appendix a and b where we discuss the polarimetric calibration and the s / n estimates for both objects ) .",
    "a first more quantitative analysis of the hd100546 butterfly pattern is shown in figure  [ azimuthal_profile ] where we plot the azimuthal profile of the polarization pattern in stokes @xmath34 and @xmath30 for the @xmath0 band as well as stokes @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the @xmath1 band . for four different annuli centered on the central star",
    "the mean count rate was computed as a function of position angle ( averaged over 10@xmath37 bins ) .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviation of the mean values computed in the individual images at each dither position divided by the square root of the number of images that were combined ( see , table  [ observations ] ) .",
    "the strongest sinusoidal variation is found between 0.10.25@xmath3 ( corresponding to roughly 1026 au in projected separation without taking into account disk inclination ) , but the pattern can be traced outward to angular separations @xmath21.4@xmath3 as can be directly seen in the @xmath30 and @xmath39 images of figures  [ h_images ] and  [ ks_images ] .",
    "the polarization pattern in our two filters is qualitatively very similar , but quantitative differences between the filters become apparent .",
    "these differences will be discussed in more detail below where the flux calibrated images are analyzed .      to assess the disk orientation we fitted isophotal ellipses to the photometrically calibrated total polarized flux images ( @xmath62 ) obtained in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter ( upper panels figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] ) .",
    "the fit yields the apparent disk position angle and its inclination assuming the disk is intrinsically centro - symmetric and geometrically thin ( i.e. , no disk flaring ) . for the fit we used",
    "three surface brightness ranges in the inner disk region ( @xmath63 ) going from 9.09.5 , 9.7510.25 , and 10.511.0 mag / arcsec@xmath64 , respectively .",
    "fitting three different brightness ranges allows us to derive a more robust estimates about the disk orientation . for the disk position angle",
    "the fit yielded a mean position angle of 136.0@xmath652.9@xmath37 ( east of north ) in the @xmath0 band and 140.0@xmath652.4@xmath37 in the @xmath1 band .",
    "for the inclination the values were 45.9@xmath651.7@xmath37 in @xmath0 and 48.0@xmath652.0@xmath37 in @xmath1 .",
    "the errors are the standard deviation of the values measured in the three regions .",
    "thus , the apparent disk orientation on these scales is comparable between the two filters and for the rest of the paper we adopt mean values of 138.0@xmath653.9@xmath37 and 47.0@xmath652.7@xmath37 for the position angle and the disk inclination , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that the true geometrical disk inclination might be somewhat different from this value as we used regions of the same brightness in polarized flux for the fit .",
    "these regions do not necessarily correspond to identical geometric regions on the disk surface as the polarization depends on the scattering properties of the underlying dust grains and the true disk flaring angle . however , most previous studies used isophotal fitting to derive estimates about the disk orientation and we compare our values to previous measurements in table  [ disk_orientation ] .",
    "our results agree with most of the previously derived values although all of them were obtained at larger angular separations .",
    "it is interesting to note that we obtain significantly different values if we fit isophots between @xmath20.71.0@xmath3 ( 13.013.5 mag / arcsec@xmath64 ) . in this case",
    "the inclination is only @xmath66 and @xmath67 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "thus , at these separations the disk appears much more face - on but we note that the observed polarized flux is no longer symmetric with respect to the disk major axis obtained from the inner disk ( see , figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] ) and a more detailed modeling of the scattering properties of the dust grains is required .",
    "we extracted the profiles of the polarized flux @xmath62 and the polarization fraction @xmath68 along the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the disk in both filters ( see , figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] ) . for both filters we used a 3-pixel wide slit with an orientation of 138@xmath37 for the major axis",
    "( table  [ disk_orientation ] ) and a perpendicular orientation for the minor axes .",
    "the resulting mean profiles are shown in figure  [ brightness_profile ] .",
    "the error bars are the standard deviation in the 3-pixel wide slit for a given position .",
    "the disk has an overall higher polarized flux surface brightness @xmath69 in the @xmath1 band than in the @xmath0 band . however , in both filters the brightness decreases similarly fast as a function of radius . between 0.11.4@xmath3",
    "we find the following power - law exponents that fit the profiles best along the major axis : @xmath70 ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath71 ( @xmath1 ) along the se semi - major axis , and @xmath72 ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath1 ) along the nw semi - major axis .",
    "the fits were `` error - weighted '' to account for the uncertainties in the measured radial profile .",
    "the errors quoted for the power - law indices are fitting errors . with one exception",
    "the profiles show the same radial dependency , roughly @xmath74 .",
    "only in the south - east the flux drops even steeper in the @xmath0-band with @xmath75 .    in case of a centro - symmetric disk seen",
    "face - on the brightness profile looks identical in all directions . for an inclined disk we would expect the radial profiles to be identical on both sides of the star along the disk major axis ( as it is observed in the @xmath1 filter ) .",
    "along the disk minor axis , which is an axis of mirror symmetry in case of an inclined but intrinsically centro - symmetric disk , the forward and backward scattering properties of the dust grains are directly imprinted and the profiles will be different for both semi - minor axes .",
    "this effect is seen in figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] : the polarized flux drops much more rapidly between roughly 0.10.8@xmath3 in the south - west direction compared to the north - east direction .",
    "this trend is observed in both filters .",
    "it is even more easily seen in the brightness profiles for the polarization fraction where the fractional polarization in the south - west is significantly lower than that in the north - east ( bottom panels of figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] ) .",
    "the fractional polarization @xmath68 measured in our data does not measure the fractional polarization of the scattered light coming from the disk alone as it relates the observed polarized flux to the total intensity composed of both the flux coming from the disk and that coming from the psf of the central star .",
    "however , by combining the results from @xcite with ours we can get an idea of the polarization fraction of the light scattered from the disk surface .",
    "@xcite found an azimuthally averaged value of roughly 10.9@xmath760.5 mag arcsec@xmath77 for the surface brightness of the disk in total scattered light using _ hst / nicmos _ at 1.6 @xmath8 m .",
    "averaging the polarized flux along the semi - major and semi - minor axes at the same separation in our @xmath0-filter image with comparable central wavelength ( figure  [ brightness_profile ] ) , we find a value of roughly 13.0@xmath760.4 mag arcsec@xmath77 .",
    "this leads to a total polarization fraction of the disk of @xmath7814@xmath5% where the errors relate to the minimum and maximum values given the photometric uncertainties . ideally , to reduce systematic errors , such a computation is based on data where the total disk intensity @xmath79 and the polarized flux @xmath62 is measured at the same time as it is possible with _ hst _",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      having the surface brightness of the polarized flux available in two filters we can compute the @xmath80$]-color of the disk surface as shown in figure  [ disk_color ] .",
    "the image has been smoothed with a moving box of 4@xmath244 pixels so that large scale structures are enhanced .",
    "filtering the image with a 2-d gaussian kernel with a fwhm of 4 pixels instead of the moving box does not change the results and leads to an almost perfectly identical image .",
    "it shows that the disk surface has on average a red color where the reddest parts with @xmath80>0.5 $ ] mag arcsec@xmath77 run roughly along the disk major axis .",
    "the innermost 1.0@xmath3 ( in diameter ) of this area appear like a bar with still moderate colors ( @xmath80=0.5$] ... 1 mag arcsec@xmath77 ) , while further out the disks becomes increasingly redder over a bigger wedge of the disk surface .",
    "it is interesting to note that the position angle of this red symmetry axis is @xmath2160@xmath37 ( east of north ) which is @xmath220@xmath37 larger than the position angle derived from the isophot fitting in section  [ radial_profiles ] but consistent with the disk position angle found by @xcite in total intensity at 1.6@xmath81 m .",
    "perpendicular to this axis , i.e. , roughly along the disk minor axis of the disk , the color is typically @xmath80<0.5 $ ] mag arcsec@xmath77 . in this context ,",
    "we remind the reader that the intrinsic @xmath80 $ ] color of a b9v star is @xmath20 mag and that the nir excess emission and the observed nir colors of hd100546 ( see table  [ parameters ] ) have their origin most likely in the tenuous inner disk of the system : @xcite found from their model that only @xmath220% of the total observed @xmath7-band flux comes directly from the star , while direct thermal emission from the inner disk and thermal emission that was scattered within the inner disk account for @xmath238% each .",
    "this leaves @xmath24% of the total flux to be coming from the star and then being scattered from the inner disk .",
    "hence , most of the scattered ( polarized ) flux that we observe here was emitted and/or scattered from the inner disk .        in figures",
    "[ disk_filter ] ,  [ disk_hole_zoom ] and  [ disk_subtract ] we analyze the structure of the disk in more detail .",
    "these images have been rotated clockwise so that the disk major axis runs horizontally .",

    "it shows that in the north - east of the disk ( at a position angle of @xmath7812@xmath37 e of n ) we have a significant drop in polarized flux and fractional polarization which shows up most clearly in the fractional polarization images .",
    "the minimum of the polarized flux is located at the same location in all images , i.e. at @xmath788 pixels radial separation from the central star ( corresponding to @xmath7822 au projected separation ) .",
    "also , the magnitude of the flux drop is similar in all images . in case of a centro - symmetric disk ,",
    "the left - hand and right - hand side of the images should be identical as the disk minor axis of the disk runs vertically through the center .",
    "hence , we can use the mirror - symmetric location in the left - hand side of the images to quantify the flux drop on the right - hand side .",
    "it shows that we measure only @xmath82 of the flux / fractional polarization in an aperture with 3-pixels radius . as this figure is the mean and the standard deviation of the ratios in all 4 images shown in figure  [ disk_hole_zoom ]",
    "we conclude that this flux drop is real as it occurs at the same position in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "\\(2 ) extending almost exactly to the north - west along the semi - major axis of the disk we find a local flux maximum in the disk ( a clump ) .",
    "although this feature is present in both filters the location of its peak flux is not exactly identical .",
    "the separation from the central star amounts to @xmath20.35@xmath3 in both images but the position angle ( e of n ) is roughly @xmath83 in the @xmath0 filter and @xmath84 in the @xmath1 filter .",
    "still , the region of enhanced polarized flux clearly overlaps in @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ disk_subtract ] we have subtracted the mirrored left - hand side of the disk from the right - hand side , to check whether this apparent flux maximum in figure  [ disk_filter ] is real . as mentioned above , an inclined centro - symmetric disk should have a mirror symmetry with respect to its minor axis .",
    "however , we can clearly see that the right - hand side of the disk has a flux excess in the inner @xmath20.6@xmath3 compared to the left - hand side in both filters , and the clump seen in figure  [ disk_filter ] is part of a larger structure . at larger radial distances",
    "no additional structures are seen and both sides of the disk appear very similar and cancel out in the subtracted images . since the differential pdi technique compensates for instrumental effects within the conica camera and since we took our data with the camera rotated by 90@xmath37 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter we conclude that these features are real and can not be a residual or ghost introduced by the camera , the telescope or the ao - system . furthermore , we applied a second high - pass filtering method by taking the fourier transform of the images and filtering all the low frequency components .",
    "also here we recovered both features in both images .",
    "finally , the features are located in image regions that show comparatively high s / n ratios ( s / n@xmath2210 in the individual @xmath34 and @xmath38 images at the location of the features ; see , appendix b ) .",
    "we will discuss these features in more detail in section  [ planet_formation ] .      as mentioned in the introduction , the current model of the hd100546 system",
    "locates the inner rim of the main disk at @xmath213 au @xcite and there is observational support for this from different studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we checked in our images whether we are able to confirm this finding .",
    "figure  [ inner_rim ] shows a horizontal cut through the center of the images shown in the upper row of figure  [ disk_hole_zoom ] .",
    "this is essentially identical to the -0.4 to + 0.4 regions of the plots shown in the upper row of figure  [ brightness_profile ] .",
    "we used a 3-pixel wide horizontal box and computed the mean and the standard deviation of the pixels for a given position .",
    "the innermost regions close to the star have been masked out if any of the pixels in the slit at this position showed count rates exceeding the linear detector regime .",
    "it shows that we find the maximum polarized flux between 0.10.15@xmath3 on _ both _ sides of the central star in _ both _ filters and a steep drop of flux closer to the star .",
    "the angular separation of the maximum flux corresponds to 1015 au at the distance of hd100546 which would support the idea that there is a jump in the density of scattering dust grains at this location .",
    "the interpretation of these results should be taken with caution .",
    "although we find the maximum flux at the suspected location of the inner rim , there is only 1 radial pixel closer to the star on both sides and in both filters that did not suffer from saturation effects .",
    "also , only along the north - west axis ( positive x - values ) the flux drop appears to be significant taking into account the error bars .",
    "however , the consistent behavior we find for the polarized flux profiles close to the star in both filters allows us to conclude that we may indeed have directly imaged the suspected inner rim of the main disk between 1020 au .",
    "ideally , additional new data with a non- ( or less ) saturated psf core would be required to fully confirm this interpretation .",
    "in order to relate the observed polarized flux to some dust grain properties of the disk surface , it is necessary to understand which side of the inclined disk is the near side and which is the far side .",
    "based on the rotation signature of the [ oi ] gas in the inner 100 au , @xcite concluded that the disk is rotating counterclockwise , i.e. , the north - west side is receding .",
    "this is also confirmed by the co measurements from @xcite . combining this information with the large - scale spiral structure seen by @xcite and also @xcite , and assuming that these spiral structures are trailing spiral arms , the north - east side of the disk is the far side and the south - west side of the disk the near side relative to earth .",
    "based on this , the observed brightness asymmetry along the disk minor axis ( section  [ radial_profiles ] ) tells us that _ the far side of the disk appears brighter in polarized flux than the near side_. this in turn means that the dust grains responsible for the polarized flux are preferentially backward scattering .",
    "we note that the observed brightness asymmetry within the innermost @xmath780.8@xmath3 along the disk minor axis was already recognized in _",
    "hst / nicmos _ data by @xcite and anisotropic scattering properties of the dust grains was mentioned as one possible explanation .",
    "interestingly , in the _ hst / acs _ data presented by @xcite there is also a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis but in the opposite sense : the amount of scattered light in the south - west is larger than in the north - east in all three optical bands .",
    "however , these authors were only sensitive to disk regions @xmath851.6@xmath3 as subtraction residuals dominated in the innermost regions .",
    "still , this result needs to be considered if one tries to derive dust grain properties from a combination of all scattered light images .",
    "we discuss this in more detail below in section  [ dust_properties ] .      to further quantify this brightness asymmetry we computed the polarized scattering function for the disk in both filters ( figure  [ scat_func ] ) .",
    "for this purpose we used again the polarized flux images shown in the upper panels of figure  [ p_and_pi_images ] . given the structures we found in the north - west side of the disk ( see , section  [ structures ] ) , the scattering functions were computed for the opposite disk side . the scattering angle @xmath86 is a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath87 ( starting from the semi - minor axis in the north - east going counterclockwise to the semi - minor axis in the south - west ) , the disk inclination @xmath88 and the disk flaring angle @xmath89 and is given by @xmath90 for the disk inclination we adopted the mean value of 47@xmath37 ( see table  [ disk_orientation ] ) and for the flaring angle 7@xmath37 which corresponds roughly to the flaring index @xmath91 used in the disk model from @xcite . for two different annuli ( 4050 au and 100110 au ) we computed the mean and",
    "the standard deviation of polarized flux in wedges of 10@xmath37 as a function of @xmath86 and plotted the results in figure  [ scat_func ] .",
    "for the annuli we also had to take into account the disk inclination to make sure we were analyzing the same disk regions in terms of physical and not projected separation from the star .",
    "the curves were normalized to unity at the brightest disk region which is the far side of the disk as described above .",
    "the maximum scattering angle is roughly 130@xmath37 while on the near side of the disk it is a bit less than 40@xmath37 .    in these scattering functions",
    "a few points points are noteworthy : ( 1 ) all four curves are qualitatively very similar : going from the backward scattering peak at the largest scattering angles to smaller @xmath86 , all curves drop , show a minimum between @xmath9270@xmath37 ( i.e. , a scattering angle with minimum scattering efficiency ) before they rise again for even smaller angles .",
    "( 2 ) comparing the curves for the @xmath0 filter with those for the @xmath1 filter , the flux drop seems less pronounced in the @xmath1 filter in both annuli .",
    "( 3 ) comparing the curves for the two annuli , in both filters the black curves ( probing 4050 au ) seem to fall off less steep than the red curves ( probing 100110 au ) going from the backward scattering peak to smaller values for @xmath86 . also , the black curves fall more or less steadily until they reach their minimum and the rise at the smallest scattering angles is not as high as for the red curves .",
    "in contrast , the red curves , after their sharp drop - off coming from the backward scattering peak , remain almost flat until they increase again at angles @xmath9350@xmath37 .",
    "the measured profiles show that the scattered surface brightness along the semi - major axes in the sky plane drops off roughly @xmath94 .",
    "if one includes disk flaring then the expected profile becomes less steep and fits even better to our observed values .",
    "taking into account the @xmath95 drop in stellar radiation this implies that the surface density of the scattering dust grains drops off roughly @xmath96 if we assume constant scattering properties of the dust grains over the observed radial range .",
    "our values for the inner @xmath2140 au of the disk are in good agreement with the results from @xcite who found an azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile @xmath97 between @xmath255250 au in their _ hst / nicmos _ 1.6@xmath8 m data .",
    "further out , the power law seems to become steeper : @xcite measured @xmath98 between 250350 au while @xcite found @xmath99 between 160 - 500 au in their optical _",
    "hst / acs _ data .",
    "this suggests either a discontinuity in the surface density of the dust disk , different dust grain properties at larger disk radii or a different disk geometry ( e.g. , changing flaring angle ) .",
    "we come back to this point below in the next section .    comparing the observed surface brightness profile to other directly imaged objects we find that also the herbig ae star hd169142 shows @xmath4 between 80190 au ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; _ hst / nicmos _ ) . for lower mass ttauri stars @xcite found @xmath100 for tw hya between 5080 au using naco / pdi between 45150 au . ] and @xcite found @xmath101 for gm aurigae for distances @xmath8585 au using _",
    "hst / nicmos _ data .",
    "irrespective of stellar mass , many circumstellar disks show a very similar surface brightness profile in scattered light images for disk radii @xmath10250 au consistent with optically thick ( and geometrically thin or only moderately flared ) disks .",
    "interesting is the comparison of hd100546 with tw hya as both objects are transition disks and both were observed with naco / pdi . for hd100546 the strongest polarimetric signal is found in the innermost regions of the disk ( i.e. , in the annulus from 0.10.25@xmath3 corresponding to roughly 1026 au in projected separation without taking into account disk inclination ) while @xcite found the stronger signal not close in but further out in the tw hya disk ( 0.761.03@xmath3 corresponding to roughly 4358 au ) .",
    "thus , apparently those regions in the tw hya transition disk that are optically thin and depleted of dust reach further out compared to hd100546 . and",
    "since tw hya lies at only @xmath254 pc distance , the data from @xcite seem to resolve these regions of reduced dust surface density . as we have seen in section  [ rim ] our data",
    "tentatively resolve the inner rim of the hd100546 main disk but probing even further in ( i.e , closer than 10 au ) is beyond the capabilities of our observations .",
    "having disk images in polarized flux one can constrain dust grain properties much better than based on disk intensity image alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in order to interpret the polarized scattering functions shown in figure  [ scat_func ] one has to keep in mind that they are the product of two functions which depend both on dust grain properties such as grain sizes , composition and porosity : the `` scattering function '' describing the dust scattering efficiency as a function of scattering angle , and the `` polarization function '' describing the introduced scattering polarization as a function of scattering angle .    as mentioned above and shown in figure  [ scat_func ] , we find that the far side of the disk appears brighter than the near side indicating that backward scattering if preferred over forward scattering .",
    "this , however , requires scattering particles that are typically at least as large as the wavelength of the incoming light .",
    "the strong flux detected in mm - observations @xcite already indicated the existence of dust grains that are considerably larger than those found typically in the ism ( i.e. , sub - micron sized ) . while most flux observed in the mm - domain",
    "is in general attributed to the mid - plane of a circumstellar disk , our scattered light observations probe grain properties of the disk surface .    to our knowledge",
    "there are only two other prominent examples of disks where backward scattering dominates : the first one is saturn s rings which are made up of icy particles that are predominantly cm - sized or larger ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the second one is the debris ring around fomalhaut .",
    "@xcite showed that the scattering function observed by @xcite could be matched with grains several tens of micrometer in size . comparing our scattering functions to those published by @xcite it seems as if grains of similar size could match our observations . with this interpretation one has to be cautious , though : first , the hd100546 is very likely optically thick which means that optical depths effects and multiple scattering will influence the scattering function compared to the optically thin , single scattering case .",
    "secondly , we only observe the _",
    "polarized _ component of the scattered light .",
    "it is important to consider that the polarization efficiency typically peaks for scattering angles close to 90@xmath37 and is always zero in exact forward or backward scattering direction .",
    "thus , a direct quantitative comparison with the dust grains sizes @xcite and dust composition of other circumstellar disks @xcite requires detailed modeling which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "qualitatively , however , it is clear that rather large , micron - sized grains are required to explain the strong backscattering peak we observe .",
    "in addition , the rather low polarization degree of the scattered light of @xmath214% ( measured at a separation of 0.5@xmath3 ; see ,  [ absolute_polarization ] ) also supports the existence of large grains on the disk surface as the polarization efficiency decreases with increasing particle size @xcite .",
    "the value we find for hd100546 is lower than that of ab aur where @xcite found roughly 40% of the scattered light to be polarized ( on average ) in an annulus of 0.71.5@xmath3 ( @xmath2100215 au ) . for the tw hya disk",
    ", @xcite found the absolute polarization to increase from @xmath210% at 0.5@xmath3 to @xmath230% at 1.2@xmath3 in both @xmath6 and @xmath0 band .",
    "further out , at roughly 2@xmath3 , the value increased up to @xmath240% in @xmath0 but falls back to @xmath210% in @xmath6 what the authors attributed to a steeper surface brightness profile of polarized flux in @xmath6 .",
    "for hd100546 , we can expected that , since our surface brightness profile along the disk major axis and that of @xcite are similar , the ratio of polarized light to total scattered light does not change significantly and hence the polarization degree between 0.51.4@xmath3 should not change significantly either . @xcite used a disk model to fit their observations and the best fit model uses the typical grain size distribution with a power low index of -3.5 and a maximum grain size of 1@xmath8 m .",
    "the same maximum grain size is currently used in the latest disk models for the surface layer of the hd100546 main disk @xcite but our data suggests that a significant fraction of large grains is required .",
    "further , we can speculate that the differences we see in the scattering function between the inner disk and the outer disk ( see , figure  [ scat_func ] ) could hint toward slightly different dust grain populations .",
    "larger grains tend to have their scattering minimum at smaller scattering angles @xcite .",
    "perhaps the grains in the inner disk regions are slightly larger than those in the outer disk regions .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the existence of the second scattering peak we observe for the smallest scattering angles : this peak is indicative of an additional dust grain population of smaller grains that are preferably forward scattering .",
    "figure  [ scat_func ] shows that this peak is stronger for the outer disk regions ( 100110 au ) compared to the inner disk regions ( 4050 au ) . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite derived a blow - out size for the dust grains of @xmath213 @xmath8 m , which would mean that smaller dust grains should be blown out to larger radii and eventually out of the system .",
    "as these computations took only radiation and gravitational forces into account it is unclear how the total gas - to - dust ratio on the disk surface is and how potential pressure for the remaining gas ( see , section  [ intro ] ) affects this number .",
    "however , having a higher fraction of small grains further out on the scattering surface could also explain the brightness asymmetry that @xcite found along the disk minor axis in their optical _",
    "hst / acs _ images . in their data",
    "forward scattering , possibly coming from smaller particles , was enhanced .",
    "this brightness asymmetry was most prominent for disk radii @xmath222.0@xmath3 ( @xmath22200 au ) .",
    "inside of 1.6@xmath3 the authors were limited by the _",
    "hst / acs _ coronagraph and subtraction residuals and no information could be derived .",
    "thus , our data are not probing the same disk region and maybe different dust grain populations are involved : smaller dust grains ( blown out ? ) at large separations , and an increasing fraction of larger particles closer to the star .",
    "we note that , similarly , another abrupt change in the color and brightness in their scattered light images for radial distances @xmath103 led @xcite to the conclusion that they were probing yet again a different regime of the circumstellar matter - the authors referred to it as an extended envelope - possibly featuring again a different dust grain population .",
    "the small inner working angle of our observations revealed structures in the inner disk regions of hd100546 that have not been detected previously ( see  [ structures ] ) .",
    "similar structures have recently been observed in the innermost regions of the ab aurigae disk also using ground - based polarimetric imaging @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to identify the underlying physical reasons for these structures as different mechanisms can leave an observational imprint on the disk surface density ranging from disk intrinsic phenomena such as gravitational instabilities or magneto - rotational instabilities to interactions between the disk and an embedded body such as a young planet .    both features , i.e. , the hole and the clump , were detected in both filters in the @xmath68 and @xmath62 images so that we can be sure that they are features of the disk ( see  [ structures ] ) . however , while interpreting these features we have to keep in mind that our observations are probing the dust component of the disk _ surface _ which is presumably optically thick at nir wavelengths .",
    "we can not say whether the features are caused by a deficiency / overabundance of dust grains at these locations ( i.e. , a physical hole/clump in the disk ) or whether different scattering properties of the dust grains are responsible for the observed features .",
    "since both features are very localized and no additional large scale disk structures are present in our data we will discuss the hole and the clump in the context of interactions with embedded bodies and will not consider possible mechanisms driven by the disk alone or very localized changes in the grains scattering properties .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that embedded planets can rapidly create gaps and sub - structures in the dust component of a circumstellar disk which depend on the mass of the planet but also on the size of the dust grains with more massive planets creating deeper and wider gaps and larger grains being more affected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these features are most prominent in the disk midplane , i.e. , where the planet is formed , and are most easily seen in ( sub - mm ) observations .",
    "this in turn means , that a lower mass body orbiting in a disk is causing only little signatures and is more challenging to see in scattered light images ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the gravitational influence of the planet could remove dust and gas particles locally and create small scale depressions on the disk surface .",
    "this could create planet - induced disk shadows in the nir which have been modeled by @xcite . even if the parameter space studied in the aforementioned paper does not cover the setup we observe here , it provides at least qualitatively an interesting explanation for the hole : even bodies with masses of @xmath104 can leave an observational imprint on the disk surface on the order of the flux drop we observe here @xcite .    since the apparent distance between the hole and the clump is rather small ( @xmath29 pixels )",
    "it seems interesting to investigate whether they may be somehow related .",
    "taking into account the rotation sense of the disk , the clump is trailing behind the hole. if we de - project the apparent separations from central source ( @xmath105 px ; @xmath106 px ) considering the disk inclination angle and the position angle of the features we find that the clump has a physical separation of @xmath235 au while for the hole the separation amounts to @xmath227 au . in the above mentioned numerical simulations from @xcite it",
    "is shown that on the outer edge of the planets orbital gaps the dust surface density is enhanced .",
    "also , in the @xcite simulations , in addition to the planet - induced disk shadow roughly at the planet s location , the disk will appear brighter radially behind the planet compared to the surroundings .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether the static radiative transfer models by @xcite , when combined with dynamical sph simulations , would predict a brighter spot trailing behind the shadow. this would match with our observations and support a physical link between the hole and the clump.    we emphasize that our observations and the structures we see in our data provide no immediate proof that planet formation is taking place in the disk around hd100546 .",
    "the observed features are , however , consistent with the predictions of certain theoretical models dealing with the observational signatures of planet - disk interactions .",
    "a good observational test for our structures will be to re - observe hd100546 in the future .",
    "if the hole and the clump are caused by ( an ) unseen planetary companion(s ) then a keplerian orbital motion with a baseline of 10 years will lead to a rotation of roughly 30@xmath37 ( assuming circular orbits ) , enough to be detected even if the estimated disk inclination is taken into account .",
    "in combination with previous findings , the results presented here emphasize that the hd100546 circumstellar disk seems to be an ideal laboratory to study the formation of planets : ( 1 ) the inner regions between 413 au are mostly devoid of dust and gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) possibly cleared out by an unseen ( planetary mass ? ) companion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; ( 2 ) the mir spectrum is remarkable similar to that of comet hale - bopp @xcite indicating that some fraction of the hd100546 dust component is similar in composition to dust found in our solar system ; and ( 3 ) our observations revealed structures in the outer parts of the disk ( at @xmath230 au separation ) that could be the signpost of an / additional body / bodies forming at these locations .    at the same time , hd100546 seems to be still accreting @xcite from its inner disk and the main disk contains a reservoir of molecular gas that is still massive enough ( @xmath8510@xmath10 m@xmath11 ) to form additional planetary bodies @xcite .",
    "it seems somewhat surprising that hd100546 still has such a significant gas reservoir , as gaseous disks around early type stars typically disperse on timescales @xmath1073 myr @xcite .",
    "even if recent estimates of the surface gravity of hd100546 indicate an age between 510 myr @xcite instead of the more frequently used age of @xmath2210 myr @xcite , the measured disk mass is exceptional .",
    "finally , it should be kept in mind that at larger separations ( @xmath222@xmath3 ) the disk becomes highly structured again as seen in the scattered light images of _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the spiral - arm like features and brightness variations detected in these images result from a warped and twisted disk geometry outside of @xmath2200 au .",
    "an interesting mechanism to produce such a tilt in the disk would be precession induced by of a swarm of planetesimal - like bodies embedded in the disk at larger separations ( 50200 au ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of such bodies would also support the existence of larger dust grains at these separations ( e.g. , created through collisions ) as suggested by our data .",
    "overall hd100546 may be a great showcase example of a young star where we can directly witness the formation of a new planetary system with at least one planet already orbiting within the disk gap and additional planets and planetesimals still forming in the disk in which they are embedded .",
    "in this paper we presented polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ) observations of the circumstellar disk around the herbig be star hd100546 using the ao assisted high - resolution camera naco at the vlt .",

    "the small inner working angles of our imaging data reveal sub - structures in the innermost regions of the main disk that have never been observed before : a hole and a clump are detected in both filters . since these two features appear in the final polarized flux images ( @xmath62 ) as well as in the fractional polarization images ( @xmath68 ) they are real and have their origin in the disk .",
    "although these features are not a definite proof that planet formation is going on in the hd100546 disk , there is qualitative agreement between our observations and models predicting the observational features of the interaction between low - mass planets and a disk .",

    "in the following we describe in detail how the effects of instrumental polarization were quantified and what cross - checks we applied to validate our approach .",
    "we use the central region around the star as zero polarization calibration source assuming that its intrinsic polarization is close to zero .",
    "an interstellar polarization component behaves like a static instrumental polarization offset and this would be corrected with our procedure .",
    "assuming @xmath131 for the interstellar polarization of hd100546 is a reasonable assumption since published polarimetry for the v - band indicate a polarization of only @xmath132 for @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "this value is composed of some intrinsic polarization component and some interstellar polarization @xmath134(v ) .",
    "since hd100546 shows only very little extinction effects ( a@xmath135=0.28 mag , @xcite ) we can assume that the intrinsic polarization is also low in the near - ir for hd100546 .",
    "of course , a real measurement would be useful but unfortunately we are not aware of any calibrated near - ir polarimetry for hd100546 .",
    "we assumed that in the final @xmath30 and @xmath39 images the mean value of the polarization fraction averaged over an annulus between 46 pixels centered on the star is zero . in case",
    "there are no scattering dust grains around the star , and hence no polarization signal , the azimuthal average of the fractional polarization should be zero in any case regardless of the radial extend of an annulus . in case",
    "there is a disk that is not seen edge - on but with a sufficiently small inclination angle ( which for hd100546 we know it is the case , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we assumed that the substructure in the disk is small enough so that the positive and negative contributions to the polarization fraction in the @xmath30 and @xmath39 images in a small centro - symmetric annulus around the star would cancel out .",
    "ideally , if the psf cores were not saturated and the central source would cancel out completely one could use the innermost pixels instead of an annulus .",
    "however , since our @xmath0 and @xmath1 images were saturated in the psf core ( see , section  [ observationssection ] ) we had to rely on those regions that were not saturated and we used the same annulus for all data sets to be consistent . in table",
    "[ instrumental_polarization ] we summarize the mean values we found for the polarization fractions in the aforementioned annulus in the different data sets .",
    "it turned out that in most cases these values were small , but not zero , and they varied between all filters and both stokes parameters .",
    "we assumed that these offsets were due to instrumental polarization effects and we corrected each individual @xmath30 and @xmath39 image for these offsets before the final images were median combined . in the final @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath38 images these offsets are , however , not additive offsets but factors .",
    "hence , before we did the median combination of the final @xmath34 and @xmath38 images we scaled the individual images with @xmath136 , where @xmath19 is the offset derived in the respective @xmath30 and @xmath39 images .",
    "once we had applied the correction factors , we checked the final results by comparing the observed structures in the different filters for both objects ( see section  [ butterfly ] ) .",
    "finding strong signals for hd100546 that are similar in all filters and not seeing any consistent and significant structure around the reference source hd106797 gives us confidence that our data reduction technique is robust .",
    "an additional check was accomplished by analyzing the azimuthal profiles of the `` butterfly '' patterns ( upper panels of figure  [ azimuthal_profile ] ; discussed in detail in section  [ butterfly ] ) .",
    "comparing these figures for all filters with similar figures derived from simple generic disk models shows that one would expect that the plotted lines computed for different annuli will always cross each other at @xmath137 irrespective of disk inclination .",
    "while this is the case in our final plots , within the error bars , it was not the case before the correction .      to demonstrate that instrumental polarization offset has a significant impact and needs to be corrected for we show in figure  [ instrumental_polarization_image ] an uncorrected and a corrected version of the @xmath34 image of hd100546 in the @xmath0 filter .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ instrumental_polarization ] the correction factor here was the largest among all images , thus this image suffered the most contamination by instrumental polarization . to compare these images directly to the final image shown in figure  [ h_images ] one has to multiply by @xmath138 in order to compensate for the fact that the camera has been rotated by 90@xmath37 compared to the images in the @xmath1 filter and hence the ordinary and extraordinary beam were switched .",

    "the main source of uncertainty in our images results from variations in flux in the ordinary and extraordinary beam between the different dither positions .",

    "compared to these variations detector read - out noise , sky noise and photon noise are negligible in the inner regions .",
    "thus , it is valid to base an estimate for the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) in our images on these variations and compare them to the final images .",
    "in addition to the median - combined final images , we also computed the mean images for each stokes parameter and each filter and the corresponding sigma images which show the standard deviation of each pixel .",
    "the mean images and median - combined images were almost identical similar in terms of overall flux levels and surface brightness distribution .",
