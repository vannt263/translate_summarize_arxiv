    "svs  13 , in the ngc1333 region , was discovered as a 2.2 @xmath0 m source by strom , vrba , & strom ( 1976 ) , and since the source is roughly aligned with the chain of herbig - haro objects 7 - 11 ( herbig 1974 ; strom , grasdalen , & strom 1974 ) , it was assumed to be the exciting source of this classical hh system .",
    "later , goodrich ( 1986 ) detected a faint visible counterpart of svs  13 .",
    "however , the star svs  13 presents a number of peculiar properties .",
    "the source exhibited a significant increase of its brightness at optical ( @xmath13 mag ) , and ir ( @xmath11 mag ) wavelengths in 1988 - 1990 ( eislffel et al .",
    "1991 ; liseau , lorenzetti , & molinari 1992 ; harvey et al .",
    "1998 ) , and since then , the flux has remained almost steady ( aspin & sandell 1994 ; khanzadyan et al .",
    "in addition , despite being optically visible , indicating that it is a relatively evolved young object , svs 13 is a strong millimeter source , known as mms1 ( e.g. , grossman et al .",
    "1987 ; looney , mundy , & welch 2000 ) , and presents other characteristics , such as the presence of an extremely high velocity co outflow , that suggest it is in a much earlier evolutionary stage ( a class 0/i object ; bachiller et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "radio continuum emission from svs 13 was first reported by snell & bally ( 1986 ) .",
    "rodrguez , anglada , & curiel ( 1997 , 1999 ) mapped svs 13 with the very large array ( vla ) at 3.6 and 6 cm ( their source vla 4 ) .",
    "anglada , rodrguez , & torrelles ( 2000 ) , through vla observations at 3.6 cm of higher angular resolution and sensitivity , discovered that svs  13 is , in fact , a close binary system .",
    "the two components of the binary ( vla 4a and vla 4b ) are separated by @xmath2 , corresponding to 65 au in projection ( assuming a distance of 220 pc ; ernis 1990 ) , and have similar flux densities at 3.6 cm . the water masers associated with svs  13 appear segregated in position and velocity , supporting the binary hypothesis ( rodrguez et al .",
    "anglada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) noted that the optical position for svs  13 ( as measured by rodrguez et al .",
    "1997 ) is closer to vla  4a , while the millimeter position ( looney et al .",
    "2000 ) is closer to vla  4b .",
    "although the precision of the astrometry available at that time did not allow an unambiguous association , this result led these authors to suggest that the strong millimeter emission reported for svs  13 could arise from only one of the components of the binary ( vla  4b , the eastern component ) , while the optical emission would come from the other component ( likely from vla  4a , the western component ) . in the interpretation proposed by anglada",
    "( 2000 ) , only one of the stars ( vla 4b ) is surrounded by a dusty envelope or disk , while the other ( vla 4a , the visible star ) is not .",
    "a similar interpretation has been proposed recently by loinard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for iras",
    "04368 + 2557 in l1527 , on the basis of the morphology of the two obscured sources observed at 7 mm .",
    "a confirmation of this interpretation for svs 13 requires a precise comparison of the positions of the sources observed at different wavelengths , in order to identify the individual contribution of each component of the binary .",
    "since the angular separation between vla 4a and vla 4b is only @xmath2 , absolute astrometry down to @xmath3 is required in order to obtain an accurate enough registration of the positions .",
    "although the accuracy of the absolute astrometry of the optical observations ( @xmath4 ) is difficult to improve due to the lack of a large enough number of suitable reference stars in the field , it is possible to improve the accuracy of the registration between the centimeter and millimeter positions by using the same instrument and calibration procedures in both wavelength ranges .    in this letter , we present vla observations at 7 mm of the region near svs 13 , carried out in the d and b configurations , using the same phase calibrator and procedures as in the previous vla observations at 3.6 cm .",
    "the b configuration observations at 7 mm provide an angular resolution of @xmath5 , similar to that of the a configuration at 3.6 cm , and an expected accuracy in the registration between both images down to @xmath6 , allowing a precise comparison of the emission at both wavelengths , necessary to test the single disk hypothesis for the svs 13 binary .",
    "these observations also provide 7 mm data on other sources in ngc1333 : vla 2 ( mms3 ) , vla 7 ( iras 2a ) , vla 10 ( iras 2b ) , and vla 17 ( mms2 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out at 7 mm using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao )  in the d and b configurations .",
    "the d configuration observations were carried out during 2000 september 7 using two phase centers , one near svs 13 ( at the position @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ) and a second near the source iras 2 ( at the position @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) .",
    "for all observations an effective bandwidth of 100  mhz with two circular polarizations was employed .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( adopted flux density of 1.45 jy ) and the phase calibrator was 0336 + 323 , with a bootstrapped flux density of 2.1@xmath110.1 jy . the data were edited and calibrated using the software package astronomical image processing system ( aips ) of nrao .",
    "cleaned maps were obtained using the task imagr of aips and natural weighting .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam size was @xmath12 with p.a.=@xmath13 , and we achieved an rms noise of @xmath10.3 mjy  beam@xmath14 .",
    "we detected a total of five sources , whose positions , flux densities and counterparts are given in table 1 .    in order to obtain higher angular resolution data of the svs 13 field",
    ", we carried out b configuration observations during 2001 april 20 , may 4 , and may 20 .",
    "the array had then 23 antennas operating at 7 mm .",
    "we observed only the svs 13 field , using the same phase center and setup as for the d configuration observations .",
    "the absolute calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( adopted flux density of 1.45 jy ) and the phase calibrator was 0336 + 323 , with a bootstrapped flux density of 2.8@xmath110.3 jy . because of poor weather conditions on april 20 and may 20 , only the may 4 data were used .",
    "data were processed using aips and cleaned maps were obtained using natural weighting .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam size was @xmath15 with p.a.=@xmath16 , and we achieved an rms noise of @xmath10.3 mjy  beam@xmath14 .",
    "positions , flux densities and counterparts of the sources detected are given in table 1 .",
    "we detect at 7 mm the sources vla 2 ( mms3 ) , vla 7 ( iras 2a ) , vla 10 ( iras 2b ) , and vla 17 ( mms2=svs 13b ) ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these sources were previously observed at 3.6 and 6 cm by rodrguez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where a discussion on their properties and counterparts can be found .",
    "vla 7 , vla 10 , and vla 2 were further observed at 3.6 cm with higher angular resolution by reipurth et al .",
    "interferometric observations at 3 mm of vla 7 and vla 10 have been recently reported by jrgensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we also detect svs 13 at 7 mm , as an unresolved source in the d configuration , and resolving it in its two components ( vla 4a and vla 4 b ) in the b configuration observation ( see table 1 ) . in figure 1",
    "we compare the 3.6 cm map observed with the a configuration ( anglada et al . 2000 ) with the 7 mm map observed with the b configuration ( this paper ) .",
    "both maps were obtained with a similar angular resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "the positions of the sources in the two maps are in agreement within @xmath18 , eliminating , thus , any ambiguity in their identification at different wavelengths . as can be seen in the figure , at 3.6 cm both sources present a similar flux density , while at 7 mm vla 4b is much stronger than vla 4a , suggesting that vla 4b is the dominant source in the millimeter wavelength range , with a negligible contribution from vla 4a .    in order to quantitatively confirm this hypothesis",
    "it should be verified that the increase of flux density of vla 4b over vla 4a at 7 mm is caused by dust emission , and not by free - free emission with a steep spectral index .",
    "usually , the emission at wavelengths longer than a few cm is dominated by the free - free emission from ionized gas , while the emission at wavelengths shorter than a few mm is dominated by thermal emission from dust .",
    "since the wavelength of 7 mm falls in between the centimeter and millimeter regimes , it should be checked , for each particular object , which is the nature of the dominant emission at this wavelength . to do that , we have plotted in figure 2 the highest angular resolution data available on svs 13 in the centimeter and millimeter ranges .",
    "the flux densities of vla 4b at 3.6 cm and 1.3 cm give a spectral index of @xmath19 , which is typical of a thermal ionized jet or a partially optically thick ionized region .",
    "an extrapolation at 7 mm of this free - free emission yields a flux density of @xmath11 mjy , much smaller than the observed value . on the other hand",
    ", a fit to the observed data from 3.4 mm to 1.3 mm ( that are supposed to trace dust emission ) gives a spectral index @xmath20 in the millimeter range , resulting in an extrapolated flux density at 7 mm in good agreement with the value observed for vla 4b ( see table 1 and fig .",
    ", we conclude that free - free emission can not account for the observed flux density of vla 4b at 7 mm , and that a contribution of a different nature , namely , thermal dust emission , likely from a circumstellar disk surrounding this object , is required .    in the case of vla 4a",
    ", the overall 3.6 cm , 1.3 cm , and 7 mm data points can be fitted together with a single spectral index @xmath21 , indicating that the observed flux density at 7 mm can be explained as free - free emission ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however",
    ", we can not discard a small contribution from dust emission at 7 mm , since an extrapolation of the 3.6 and 1.3 cm data alone gives a free - free contribution at 7 mm slightly below the observed flux density of vla 4a . the difference ( @xmath220.8 mjy )",
    "could correspond to a contribution from dust , being it about five times smaller than in the case of vla 4b .    in summary ,",
    "our results indicate that of the two components of the svs 13 binary system , the source vla 4b is associated with a much larger amount of dust than the source vla 4a .",
    "this strongly supports the proposal by anglada et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who suggested that the millimeter source mms1 is the counterpart of the centimeter source vla 4b . on the basis of the available optical astrometry",
    ", these authors also proposed that vla 4a is the counterpart of the visible star svs 13 .",
    "vla 4b appears as a compact source in our 7 mm map obtained with the b configuration with an angular resolution of @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , suggesting that the dust emission traced by this source originates in a compact circumstellar structure , likely a disk , with radius @xmath23 au .",
    "the size of the disk is smaller than that of the typical accretion disks observed around single t tauri stars , with radii of 100 - 150 au ( e.g. , dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ; wilner et al .",
    "2000 ) , and is more similar to that of the compact disks observed in the l1551  irs5 binary system ( 10 au ; rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting that they are truncated by the tidal effects of the companion star .",
    "the 7 mm flux density of vla 4b , together with the millimeter data shown in figure 2 , can be fitted by a simple disk model .",
    "we assume a geometrically thin , vertically isothermal disk , characterized by power - law radial dependences of temperature and surface density , and we adopt the opacity law given by dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) .",
    "the data are fitted with a distribution of dust grains with a maximum size of 1 mm , a temperature distribution @xmath24  k , a surface density @xmath25  g  @xmath26 , implying a disk mass of 0.06 @xmath27 , for a radius of 30 au .",
    "thus , it seems plausible that the emission of vla 4b is tracing a protoplanetary disk , since the mass obtained exceeds the minimum mass required to form a planetary system like the solar one ( @xmath28 ) . since any dust emission associated with vla 4a is at least five times weaker than that of vla 4b , if a disk was associated with vla 4a , we expect its mass to be at least five times smaller than that of the disk associated with vla 4b .",
    "we note that the flux density observed in the d configuration is larger than the total flux observed in the b configuration , indicating an additional contribution from an extended component , likely the infalling envelope",
    ". a fit to the overall spectral energy distribution , taking into account simultaneously the contributions of different components ( disks+envelope ) , similarly to what has been done for l1551 irs5 ( osorio et al .",
    "2003 ) , would be useful to better constrain the properties of each component .",
    "thus , the observational results obtained for svs 13 imply that it is feasible that the development of a protoplanetary disk occurs preferentially in only one of the components of a young close binary system , with the disk absent or much less significant in the other component . in this respect ,",
    "the case of the svs 13 binary system appears to be opposite to the l1551  irs5 case , where both components of the binary system are associated with circumstellar disks of dust of comparable characteristics ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "these results are in agreement with theoretical simulations ( e.g. , bate & bonnell 1997 ) that show that , depending on the mass ratio of the components and the specific angular momentum of the system , the development of circumstellar disks can occur either around a single component or around both components of the binary . according to bate & bonnell ( 1997 ) , a circumstellar disk forms around one of the components of the binary only if the specific angular momentum of the infalling gas is greater than the specific orbital angular momentum of that component about the center of mass of the binary .",
    "thus , if a binary system grows to its final mass mainly via the accretion of material with low specific angular momentum , the primary may have a large circumstellar disk , while the secondary is essentially naked .",
    "the systems formed by this method are expected to be binaries with separations of the order of @xmath29 au , and they should not be developing a significant circumbinary disk .",
    "for infall with high angular momentum , both components can develop a circumstellar disk and even a circumbinary disk can be formed .    under this simplified scheme ,",
    "the low angular momentum scenario , with a disk in only one star , appears to correspond to the case of the svs 13 binary , where the two components are separated by 65 au in projection , and where vla 4a would be the secondary , whereas vla 4b ( the dominant source at millimeter wavelengths ) would be the primary viewed through its circumstellar disk . on the other hand , l1551  irs5 apparently corresponds to a case of accretion of material with higher angular momentum , with both components associated with a circumstellar disk ( rodrguez et al .",
    "1998 ) and probably surrounded by a circumbinary disk ( osorio et al . 2003 ) .    in order to confirm these suggestions , it would be interesting to obtain the orbital parameters of these systems and to identify which component is the primary through accurate measurements of absolute proper motions .",
    "relative proper motions between the two components of the l1551  irs5 system have been obtained recently ( rodrguez et al . 2003 ) , and accurate absolute proper motions have been measured for the t tau sa / sb system ( loinard , rodrguez & rodrguez 2003 ) . at present , no proper motions are available for the svs 13 system , but these promising results obtained for other sources suggest that this goal could be attainable in a relatively near future , providing a complete test for the properties of the svs 13 binary system .",
