    "the problem of electronic phase separation with the formation of ferromagnetic ( fm ) or paramagnetic ( pm ) spin polarons ( magnetic droplets or ferrons ) due to the self - trapping of charge carriers in an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) matrix became very popular nowadays , especially in the studies of high - t@xmath6 superconductors and the systems with the colossal magnetoresistance ( such as lamno@xmath7 manganites doped by ca ) .",
    "for isotropic materials , the size and shape of fm droplets was evaluated in several papers beginning from the seminal work of nagaev  @xcite , for more detail see ref .  .",
    "the characteristic size of a fm droplet turns out to be of the order of 1520and its optimum shape in isotropic 3d manganites is a spherical one .",
    "later on , kagan and kugel  @xcite analyzed the case of layered manganites ( like(la , ca)@xmath8mn@xmath9o@xmath10 ) and demonstrated that the droplets with the lowest energy have the ellipsoidal shape .",
    "the fm droplets of cylindrical shape considered first by nagaev  @xcite for this class of manganites correspond to a higher energy .",
    "currently , the phase separation in anisotropic materials was also addressed in connection with low - dimensional organic compounds  @xcite and quasi - one - dimensional magnets such as bacoo@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "magnetic polarons in doped one - dimensional ( 1d ) afm magnetic chains were recently considered in refs .  , where the possibility of rather long - range magnetic distortions around the polaron was demonstrated .",
    "another possibility to have a strongly anisotropic situation arises when we take into account an interplay between the microscopic phase separation and charge ordering ( stripe formation ) , include the jahn - teller type of effects ( orbital degrees of freedom ) , or consider stable crystallographic distortions . in these cases , the quasi-1d zig - zag or ladder structures",
    "are often observed in the corresponding systems  @xcite .    in this paper , we present the calculations concerning the shape and size of fm droplets in anisotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) cases when , generally speaking , the electron hopping integrals @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 along @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 directions , as well as the afm exchange integrals @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are different .",
    "we get that , by analogy with the situation in layered manganites  @xcite , the most favorable shape of a fm droplet is an ellipsoidal one .",
    "moreover , the binding energy and the effective volume of the droplet are expressed only in terms of universal averaged parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these results are interesting , in particular , in relation to the neutron scattering experiments giving an indication of the existence of fm clusters with different shapes in perovskite and layered manganites  @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we consider the purely 2d situation and find the most favorable shape of a 2d ferron comparing the energies of elliptical and rectangular droplets in the general anisotropic 2d case : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we find that in two dimensions , the minimal energy corresponds to the elliptical shape .",
    "then , we include the third dimension ( @xmath19 and @xmath13 ) and compare the energies of the cylinder and ellipse in the case when both of them have the optimum elliptical shape of the 2d cross - sections .",
    "we find again that the minimal energy in the 3d case corresponds to the ellipsoidal shape of fm droplets . at the end of the paper , we provide some discussions and conclusions .",
    "let us first consider the anisotropic 2d case .",
    "in this case , there are two different electron hopping integrals @xmath22 and two different constants of the afm exchange interaction @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ 2dlatt ] . to some extent",
    ", this case has a lot of similarities with two - leg ladder systems rather popular nowadays ( see , for example , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "2d anisotropic doped antiferromagnet with the square lattice .",
    "@xmath24 are afm exchange integrals , @xmath22 are the electron hopping integrals , @xmath25 and @xmath26 define the volume of the rectangular ferron in 2d.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    throughout this paper , we consider the kondo - lattice model with the hamiltonian @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are electron creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath30 , @xmath31 for a square lattice in 2d , @xmath32 denote the neighboring sites in the lattice along the @xmath33 direction , @xmath34 is the spin of a conduction electron ( @xmath35 is the pauli matrix ) , @xmath36 is a local spin , @xmath37 are afm exchange integrals , @xmath38 are the hopping integrals for conduction electrons , and parameter @xmath39 corresponds to the hund s rule coupling between a local spin @xmath40 and a spin of a conduction electron .",
    "we work in the double - exchange limit , which implies that @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", the ground state of the system is unstable toward the nanoscale phase separation  @xcite with the formation of fm polarons inside the afm matrix .",
    "let us now evaluate the total energy of the phase - separated state for different shapes of ferrons possible in the 2d case .",
    "let us first consider a rectangular fm droplet ( ferron ) located at the square lattice with the intersite distance @xmath42 .",
    "its characteristic sizes along @xmath14 and @xmath15 axes are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless volume @xmath43 of such a ferron can be defined as @xmath44 .",
    "the kinetic energy of charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) within the fm droplet is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the concentration of charge carriers and @xmath47 is a binding energy corresponding to the first ( the lowest ) level in the rectangular potential well .",
    "the latter can be found by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation ( see ref . ) @xmath48 where @xmath49    for the case of a well - defined ferron ( without an extended tail of magnetic distortions , which we will consider throughout the present paper , the corresponding boundary conditions have the form    @xmath50    hence ,    @xmath51    and @xmath52    now , we can pass to the evaluation of the potential energy given by the terms related to the afm exchange interaction .",
    "in the domains with the ferromagnetic order ( ferrons ) , the afm exchange leads to the positive contribution to the total energy @xmath53 for the afm regions , which are free of ferrons , the corresponding contribution to the energy can be written as @xmath54    hence , the total potential energy yields @xmath55    as a result , the total energy related to the formation of fm droplets has the following form @xmath56   + \\nonumber \\\\ n\\left[t_x\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{l_x}\\right)^2 +   t_y\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{l_y}\\right)^2\\right ]   + 4\\left(j_x + j_y\\right)s^2 n\\frac{l_xl_y}{a^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the minimization of energy   with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 gives @xmath57    a solution to equations   reads    @xmath58    multiplying two equations   by each other , we find    @xmath59    now , introducing notation @xmath60 we find @xmath61 thus , the dimensionless volume ( area ) @xmath43 of a 2d ferron can be written as @xmath62 we get quite a remarkable relationship expressing the volume of a 2d ferron in terms of the @xmath63 ratio .",
    "correspondingly , the minimized total energy   takes the form @xmath64    introducing the energy of fm polaron by the relationship @xmath65 we get finally @xmath66 it is again worth to notice that the energy of the fm polaron in 2d depends only upon the product of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "now , we can consider the energy a two - dimensional fm polaron having the shape of an ellipse .",
    "for the same characteristic sizes ( principal axes)of the ferron , its volume in the case of an ellipse is @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy is again given by eqs .  - .",
    "to solve the schrdinger equation in this geometry , we should transform an ellipse to a circle .",
    "this could be done , for example , by the dilatation along the @xmath15 axis : @xmath68 .",
    "then , we have    @xmath69    where and @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the radial part of the laplacian operator in 2d . thus , the ellipse @xmath72 in the old @xmath73 coordinates transforms to the @xmath74 circle in the new @xmath75 coordinates . from equation for the circle in terms of new",
    "coordinates @xmath75 , it is clear that @xmath76 .",
    "hence , we have    @xmath77    and the ferron volume in the initial ( old ) coordinates reads @xmath78    in this case , a solution to the schrdinger equation   has the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the bessel function of zeroth order . the boundary condition @xmath81 yields @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the first zero of function @xmath80 .",
    "this means that @xmath84    then , we have @xmath85 + e_{pol},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 the minimization of polaron energy   with respect to @xmath25 gives @xmath87 thus , we have ( see eqs .   and ) @xmath88    introducing again @xmath3 and @xmath2 defined by eq .  , we find @xmath89 so , the ferron volume is again expressed as a function of the universal ratio @xmath63 .",
    "comparing expressions and for the volumes of rectangular and elliptical ferrons , we find @xmath90 this means that the elliptical ferron is a more compact object ( i.e. it has a smaller volume ) in comparison to the rectangular ferron .",
    "accordingly , the energy of elliptical magnetic polaron can be written in the following form @xmath91 we can see again that the ferron energy depends only upon the product of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we can compare the ferron energies for the cases of rectangular and elliptical shapes using eqs .   and",
    "@xmath92 we see that the ratio of energies turns out to be identical to the ratio of the volumes .",
    "thus , the elliptical shape of the ferron is more favorable in energy than the rectangular shape .",
    "first of all , this is caused by a more compact structure of the elliptical ferron .",
    "another cause was emphasized in ref .  .",
    "the thing is that the elliptical shape of ferron in 2d has a close similarity to the one - electron spectrum characteristic of the empty square lattice : @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . concluding this section",
    ", we can say that the elliptical shape is the shape most favorable in energy for a fm droplet in doped anisotropic antiferromagnets with the 2d square lattice .",
    "now , we can include the third dimension ( which means the inclusion of @xmath19 and @xmath13 ) and consider the shape of a fm droplet in a doped anisotropic antiferromagnet with the 3d cubic lattice .",
    "of course ( having in mind the results of the previous section ) , we have to consider fm droplets with the 2d cross - section most favorable in energy . in other words , we consider the 3d droplets having the shape of an ellipse in the @xmath73 plane",
    ". then the problem effectively reduces to the comparison of energies and volumes of a cylinder and of an ellipsoid of rotation both having an elliptical cross - section with dimensions @xmath96 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "first , let us consider 3d fm droplets of cylindrical shape .",
    "the volume of such a droplet can be written as    @xmath97    in this case , the total energy has the form    @xmath98   + \\nonumber \\\\ 4\\left(j_x + j_y + j_z\\right)s^2\\omega n + t_xn\\left(\\frac{j_{0,1 } a}{l_x}\\right)^2 + t_zn\\left(\\frac{\\pi a}{l_z}\\right)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the polaron energy @xmath99\\ ] ] is given by the expression @xmath100    the minimization of polaron energy   with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath101 yields @xmath102 where we introduced the effective exchange integral for the 3d case @xmath103 from eqs .  , we get @xmath104    squaring the second equation in and dividing the result by the first equation , we exclude @xmath25 and obtain the following expression for @xmath101 @xmath105 substituting eq .   to the first equation in ,",
    "we get @xmath106 hence , we have @xmath107 using eqs .   and , we find volume @xmath108 of the cylindrical ferron @xmath109 introducing the effective hopping integral for the 3d case @xmath110 we can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath111    similar to the the 2d case , we see that the ferron volume in 3d is also a function of @xmath63 ratio , where the effective parameters are given by eqs .   and .",
    "substituting expressions  ,   , and   for @xmath101 , @xmath25 , and @xmath108 , respectively , to the energy of a fm polaron , we get @xmath112 we see that the polaron energy in the 3d case again depends on the universal parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 , but the specific form of this dependence is slightly different : @xmath113 in 3d as compared to @xmath114 in 2d .      here",
    ", we calculate the volume and the energy of the fm droplet having the ellipsoidal shape .",
    "the volume of the ellipsoidal droplet in the 3d case is @xmath115    in this case , the total energy of the system has the form @xmath98 \\nonumber \\\\+\\varepsilon_0n + 4\\left(j_x + j_y + j_z\\right)s^2\\omega n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hence the energy of the elliptical fm polaron can be written as @xmath116 where we again introduce @xmath2 defined by eq .  .",
    "as above , energy @xmath47 can be found by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 using the the dilatation along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes : @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 in thenew coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . here , we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 is the radial part of the laplacian operator in 3d .    in these coordinates ,",
    "a droplet is confined within a sphere of radius @xmath76 .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath126 and the droplet volume expressed in terms of initial ( old ) coordinates reads @xmath127    a solution to the schrdinger equation has the form @xmath128    the boundary condition @xmath129 yields @xmath130 .",
    "hence , we find @xmath131 and the energy of ellipsoidal fm polaron takes the form @xmath132 the minimization of polaron energy with respect to @xmath25 yields @xmath133 as a result , we get the expression for @xmath25 @xmath134 substituting eq .   to , we find the volume of an ellipsoidal droplet @xmath135 where @xmath3 is again given by eq .  .",
    "we see that the volume of the ellipsoidal droplet is also determined by the dimensionless universal ratio @xmath63 . dividing eq .   by eq .  , we obtain the ratio of volumes for ellipsoidal and cylindrical droplets @xmath136 we see that the ellipsoidal fm droplet is a more compact object ( with a smaller volume ) than the cylindrical one .",
    "substituting expression for @xmath25 to the polaron energy , we find @xmath137 hence the ratio of energies corresponding to two different shapes of ferrons is again identically equal to the ratio of their volumes @xmath138 thus , in the 3d case , the ellipsoidal droplet has the lowest energy in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "we considered the formation and the shape of droplets in the most general cases of doped anisotropic 2d and 3d antiferromagnets with arbitrary values of the electron hopping integrals @xmath38 and the afm exchange integrals @xmath37 .",
    "we found that in the anisotropic 2d case ( when @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) , the most energetically favorable shape of fm droplets is an ellipse . in the anisotropic 3d case ( when @xmath141 and we include into consideration the third dimension with @xmath13 and @xmath19 ) , the most energetically favorable shape of fm droplets is an ellipsoid .",
    "moreover , both the binding energy and the volume of fm droplets depend in the 2d as well as in the 3d cases upon only two universal parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in the 2d case , these parameters are @xmath142 and @xmath143 , whereas , in the 3d case , the corresponding expressions have the form @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    note that in the present paper , we considered only the case of free ferrons , which are not strongly localized at donor impurities .",
    "the study of strongly localized ferrons bound to impurities , especially their shape and the form of the cloud of magnetic distortions related to them ( similar to those described in refs .   and",
    ") will be the subject of a separate publication .",
    "note also that the situation would be more complicated for fm droplets in the frustrated triangular or kagome lattices .",
    "this is a case , for example , in an interesting quasi-1d magnetic material bacoo@xmath7 , where the chains of co@xmath146 ions form a triangular lattice  @xcite .",
