    "friction at the atomic scale is currently actively studied @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this research is to understand whether extremely low friction can be obtained by an appropriate choice of the sliding conditions .",
    "commensurability between the sliding lattices is one of the elements that determine friction . for a purely incommensurate infinite contact",
    ", theoretical arguments suggest that static friction should vanish @xcite .",
    "however , very low friction has been measured also for finite incommensurate contacts at very low velocities @xcite and this effect has been called superlubricity @xcite . the atomic force microscope ( afm )",
    "study @xcite found that the sliding of graphite flakes on graphite can occur with very low friction , depending strongly on the relative orientation . at the same time , rotation of the flake can lead to a rapid increase of friction and stick - slip motion , corresponding to a locking into a commensurate orientation .",
    "states of very different friction have also been observed to coexist in the sliding of nanoparticles @xcite and have been attributed to contamination or amorphous surfaces .",
    "this paper examines theoretically the sliding of nanocrystals and substrates which both have different , but regular rectangular lattices . by means of a simple , analytically soluble model",
    ", we show that stable orientations exist for any size nanocrystal , and derive some general properties , showing how the stability depends on the scan line .",
    "the stable orientations are independent of the velocity and nearly independent of the corrugation , but depend only on the geometry of the substrate and contact layer of the nanocrystal .",
    "we can also estimate the energy barriers necessary to rotate the nanocrystal from a given orientation to another .",
    "we apply the results to w nanocrystals on an naf(001 ) substrate .",
    "naf has been studied extensively as a substrate in the context of nanotribology @xcite and w is commonly used for afm tips ( see , for instance ref .",
    "both materials have a bcc lattice structure and the ( 001 ) surfaces in contact can thus be described by one finite and one infinite square lattice .",
    "the lattice parameters of the two materials are very similar ( 0.31585  nm and 0.32668  nm respectively ) , which ensures the existence of nearly commensurate orientations for small enough nanocrystal . for w , the corrugation on naf(001 ) is of the order of 1  ev , a value typical for many substrate systems ( see , for instance ref .",

    ", we apply a model previously introduced to study the dynamics of hexagonal flakes on hexagonal lattices@xcite to rectangular contact layers on substrates with rectangular lattices .",
    "one of the important results is that the inherent lack of robustness of the low friction motion found in the hexagonal graphite system for particular scan lines is not present for rectangular lattices , which opens the possibility for practical applications of low - friction sliding .",

    "we wish to study the dynamics of small rigid nanocrystals of atoms arranged in a regular lattice on a regular substrate , as sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : nanocrystal ] .",
    "the contact layer consists of one atomic plane and lies in the @xmath0 plane parallel to the periodic substrate . for matched lattice parameters , by changing the orientation @xmath1 of the nanocrystal on the substrate ,",
    "the contact layer can be either commensurate or incommensurate with the substrate atoms .",
    "the incommensurate states which produce low friction can be destroyed by rotations around the @xmath2 axis that lead to a locking in a commensurate orientation @xcite .",
    "each atom of the contact layer is subjected to a periodic potential due to the substrate and to an external load force which may be applied to the nanocrystal . additionally , the contact layer atoms experience a friction force due to dissipation of kinetic energy into phonon modes of the substrate crystal . the remaining nanocrystal atoms are further away from the substrate and we may therefore assume that they couple only to the other nanocrystal atoms .",
    "the afm cantilever or a similar device used to investigate friction can be modelled by coupling the centre of mass of the nanocrystal harmonically with a spring with force constant @xmath3 to a support moving at constant velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the friction is given by the average value of the lateral force @xmath5 , exerted by the spring on the nanocrystal .    in three dimensions ,",
    "a rigid nanocrystal is thus left with only 6 degrees of freedom : the coordinates of the centre of mass , and the orientation . despite this",
    ", the system is still too complicated to perform the stability analysis analytically . in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple model was proposed to describe the rotation of hexagonal graphite flakes on hexagonal graphite lattices and its consequences for low - friction sliding .",
    "we briefly summarise this model and some of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite here in a general context .",
    "a possible simplification of the system is suggested by the nature of the dynamics .",
    "we are interested in the rotation around the @xmath2 axis , which affects the commensurability , and therefore the friction .",
    "hence , the two relevant degrees of freedom are the position of the centre of mass along the scan line , @xmath6 , and the orientation , @xmath1 . consequently , instead of the full substrate potential @xmath7 , we introduce a potential @xmath8 , one example of which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : v(x , phi ) ] , where one can see that the corrugation felt by the nanocrystal as a whole decays quickly away from the commensurate orientations @xmath9 .",
    "such a model is fully described by the initial support position @xmath10 , support velocity @xmath11 , mass @xmath12 and moment of inertia @xmath13 of the nanocrystal , the effective potential @xmath8 , and the viscous friction coefficient @xmath14 of a contact layer atom on the substrate .",
    "altogether , this model is similar to the tomlinson model@xcite , but with one additional degree of freedom which accounts for the rotational dynamics .",
    "the details of the substrate and contact layer lattice geometry , choice of scan line , and the applied external load force are accounted for in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we write the equations of motion of the simplified system as a dynamical system of first - order differential equations for the position @xmath6 , velocity @xmath15 , orientation @xmath1 , and angular velocity @xmath16 , @xmath17    -    some general properties of the potential energy @xmath8 can be derived from the symmetries of the substrate lattice and contact layer .",
    "the translation symmetry of the substrate dictates that @xmath8 must be periodic in @xmath6 . a good representation of @xmath8 is therefore given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are both smooth functions that represent the average value of the potential energy and the amplitude of the modulation respectively .",
    "furthermore , rotational symmetries of the substrate and contact layer lead to rotational symmetries of @xmath8 of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an angle of rotation under which the contact layer is symmetric .",
    "these symmetries of the potential @xmath8 further imply that @xmath23 for the case we consider here , square lattices , we show later in sec .",
    "[ sec : square ] that also @xmath24 this also holds for some combinations of parameters of rectangular lattices . in turn , these equations imply that @xmath25 and @xmath26 have extrema in @xmath27 . since the torque , given by eq .",

    "if the nanocrystal is on the manifold , it will remain there , and keep its orientation .",
    "in general , there may be more invariant manifolds at other orientations , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 have additional extrema which coincide .",
    "if the orientation of an invariant manifold is incommensurate , the corrugation is relatively small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : v(x , phi ) ] ) and the friction force on the nanocrystal is small as well .",

    "the orientation of the nanocrystal remains nearly constant and the motion in the @xmath6 direction exhibits stick - slip behaviour which is relatively mild for incommensurate orientations and corresponds to a relatively low average friction force .",
    "the existence of incommensurate invariant manifolds does not necessarily mean that low friction can be observed under experimental conditions .",
    "the invariant manifolds may not be stable , namely , the nanocrystal may rotate away from it if it is at an orientation which deviates slightly from the invariant manifold .",
    "we must therefore investigate the stability and robustness of the invariant manifolds .",

    "<S> we investigate the stability of low - friction sliding of nanocrystal with rectangular atomic arrangement on rectangular lattices , for which analytical results can be obtained . we find that several incommensurate periodic orbits exist and are stable against thermal fluctuations and other perturbations . as incommensurate orientations lead to low corrugation , and therefore low friction , such incommensurate </S>",
    "<S> periodic orbits are interesting for the study of nanotribology . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results compare very well with simulations of w nanocrystals on naf(001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry and high typical corrugation of substrates with square lattices increase the robustness compared to typical hexagonal lattices , such as graphite . </S>"
