    "the single hard bremsstrahlung process is critical in precision studies of standard model physics over a wide range of scales , from the 1 gev regime , where it is exploited in radiative return studies of intermediate - energy hadron physics , to the 100 gev regime and beyond , where it is used for radiative return studies of the @xmath2 resonance .",

    "@xcite , and in general a very good agreement was found .",
    "however , it is clear from the comparisons in ref .  @xcite that small differences appear at the level of the nnll ( next - to - next - to - leading - log ) , suggesting differences in the levels of `` exactness '' in the calculations .",
    "these differences are largely due to how differential the results are , and how the mass corrections are included . both ref .",

    "these comparisons therefore are not a complete test of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite at the nnll level .",
    "another calculation of the exact virtual corrections to single hard bremsstrahlung has appeared recently .",
    "an exact differential result including mass corrections needed for an accurate calculation of collinear emission is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( kr ) .",
    "this result was obtained for use in radiative return studies of hadronic final states.@xcite the virtual correction without explicit mass terms@xcite was obtained for use in tagged photon experiments , and this was extended to the small angle regime for untagged experiments with the inclusion of finite mass corrections@xcite , which become significant in collinear emission , even in very high - energy collisions .",

    "@xcite , where the effect of including yfs ( yennie - frautschi - suura ) exponentiation@xcite in the  mc  versus the unexponentiated approach of phokhara plays an important role in the differences found .    presently , our interest is not in comparing the mc s but in comparing the order @xmath3 matrix elements for hard photon emission used in each .",
    "a direct comparison of the matrix elements jmwy and kr was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a common mc evaluation of both expressions .",
    "it was found that the expressions agree to @xmath4 units of the born cross section for a photon energy below 95% of the beam energy at 200 gev cms energy .",
    "this level of agreement was the result of careful analytical work to cancel large terms in the expressions of kr .",
    "the published matrix elements of kr and jmwy have very different forms , which is evident in part from the appearance of mass corrections proportional to @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the expressions of kr , where @xmath7 is an incoming fermion momentum and @xmath8 is the emitted hard photon momentum .",
    "such terms are absent in the jmwy expression , and we have verified that they cancel exactly in the kr expression as well , although this is not immediately obvious . this cancellation should be implemented analytically to obtain a stable mc comparison of the results . such an analytical cancellation is presented here .    the functions used to construct the stable comparisons were introduced in ref .",
    "a proof that the massless limits of the kr and jmwy expressions agree at nll ( next - to - leading - log ) order was sketched and the size of the difference in the mass corrections was calculated in ref .",
    "mc results for a comparison of the matrix elements in the 1 gev radiative return regime were also obtained.@xcite in this paper , we will present details of the stabilization procedure needed for very high precision comparisons , and present new mc comparisons which use these versions of the matrix elements , which have been improved since the publication of refs .",
    "@xcite for better behavior at lower cms energies .",
    "an important part of this comparison is an examination of the finite - mass corrections used in the virtual corrections of kr and jmwy .",
    "the electron mass terms containing denominators of the form @xmath9 give contributions of the same order as some of the `` massless '' contributions upon integration .",
    "therefore , the finite mass corrections of both calculations are compared explicitly , and it is shown that both mass corrections are identical to next - to - leading - log ( nll ) order .",
    "this supplements the result that the massless results agree to nll order , showing that the complete virtual corrections agree up to nnll terms .",
    "these nnll terms are the subject of the numerical comparisons , both with and without mass terms .",
    "we need to point out that both approaches to the exact mass corrections discussed here , that used by jmwy and that used by kr , should have the property that , upon integrating over the final phase space , the resulting integrated cross section should contain all finite terms that do not vanish for @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite , including the virtual photon contribution which cancels the ir divergence in the real emission cross section , gives @xmath193 at @xmath194 gev and @xmath195 at @xmath196 gev . dividing by @xmath192",
    "instead of @xmath169 would give essentially the same comparisons at 500 gev , but increase the differences by a factor on the order of 10 at 1 gev .",
    "in this paper , we have compared two versions of the exact virtual corrections to initial - state bremsstrahlung in fermion pair production in detail , examining the collinear limits ( nll behavior ) analytically both with and without the explicit mass corrections in each case .",
    "we found that the results of jmwy and kr agree to nll order , both with and without masses , and that both results have the same soft limits .",
    "numerical comparisons of the two virtual photon expressions were made by integrating them with the  mc . the results were presented both in terms of integrated yfs residuals , to match comparisons made earlier , and in differential form , to permit comparison of the virtual photon corrections as a function of photon energy . it was found that the differential results agree to within @xmath185 units of the born cross section across almost all photon energies , for both high energy ( 500 gev ) and lower energy ( 1 gev ) scattering .",
    "the difference between the integrals of the yfs beta functions over the full photon energy range are also on the order of @xmath1 .",
    "this level of agreement is compatible with that found in earlier studies at 200 gev.@xcite .",
    "the two virtual photon expressions compared agree much better when the mass corrections are omitted from both .",
    "this is because the mass corrections in the kr expression are typically of order @xmath1 , while the jmwy mass corrections tend to be of order @xmath177 units of the born cross section over most of the photon energy range .",
    "part of this difference could be due to the structure of the expressions , since the jmwy expression was created with the expectation of using it in the  mc , while the kr result is foreign to this mc . however , some difference is not surprising , due to the difference in approach to the mass corrections .",
    "the jmwy result follows the approach of berends _ et al _ @xcite , adding the essential mass corrections for the collinear limits , and kr use an expansion in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "the results are very different analytically , with the kr expressions containing many more terms .",
    "the results found in this paper give a clear estimate of the size of the difference in two exact , mass - corrected matrix elements for initial - state radiation in fermion pair production .",
    "we have also found that these matrix elements agree to nll order , and have compared two approaches to adding mass corrections to the matrix element .",
    "such information is important for estimating the precision of these matrix elements in applications to such processes as the lep2 final data analyis , radiative return at @xmath151 and b factories , and anticipated future ilc physics .",
    "the stabilized expressions in this paper depend on two sets of functions introduced to handle cancellations in differences of logarithms and dilogarithms with very similar arguments .",
    "the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined recursively by        expansions can be used to evaluate @xmath64 for @xmath200 small or @xmath201 for @xmath202 small . for the logarithmic difference function @xmath66 , @xmath203 differences between the functions @xmath64 for similar arguments",
    "may be calculated using the identity @xmath204 valid for @xmath205 . some identities for arguments containing ratios are      for the dilogarithmic difference function @xmath67 , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the @xmath209 derivative of @xmath198 , which may be calculated recursively using @xmath210 in the limit where both @xmath200 and @xmath202 are small , a double expansion is useful , @xmath211    the functions @xmath64 have a logarithmic singularity at @xmath212 .",
    "the functions @xmath213 are singular at @xmath214 for @xmath215 , but can be calculated in for @xmath200 approaching 1 with @xmath216 using the identity @xmath217 where @xmath218 , @xmath219 is the integer part of @xmath220 and @xmath221 for @xmath222 even , @xmath223 for @xmath222 odd .",
