    "su uma - type dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which are close binary systems transferring matter from a red dwarf secondary to a white dwarf , forming an accretion disk . in su uma - type dwarf novae ,",
    "two types of outbursts are seen : normal outbursts and superoutbursts .",
    "superoutbursts are defined by the presence of ( positive ) superhumps , which are humps with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period [ for general information of cvs , dne , su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "rz lmi is one of the most enigmatic su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this object was originally discovered as an ultraviolet - excess variable star ( @xcite ; later given a designation of fbs 0948@xmath1344 : @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the object had a spectral energy distribution of spectral classes o  b at maximum . when the object was fading or rising , strong emission lines appeared .",
    "@xcite studied 16 objective prism plates and seven direct imaging plates and recorded strong variation with a range of 1417 mag .",
    "the object was recorded at 17 mag on the palomar obervatory sky survey ( poss ) .",
    "based on the colors and rapid variation within a few days , @xcite suggested a dwarf nova - type classification .",
    "@xcite also selected it as an ultraviolet - excess object ( pg 0948@xmath1344 ) and was spectroscopically confirmed as a cv .",
    "@xcite gave a variability range of @xmath2=14.416.8 without details ( the minimum likely referred to the magnitude in poss ) . despite the finding by @xcite",
    ", @xcite gave a designation of rz lmi as a novalike ( nl ) variable by referring to @xcite .",
    "@xcite also selected rz lmi as an ultraviolet - excess object .",
    "the nature of the variability of this object remained unclear . knowing the dwarf nova - type classification ,",
    "one of the authors ( tk ) visually observed this object in 19871988 and found relatively stable @xmath020  d cycle lengths but probably with additional short outbursts .",
    "this result was reported in the domestic variable star bulletin `` henkousei '' ( in japanese ) .",
    "this report was probably the first to document the unusual cyclic variation of rz lmi .",
    "two teams photometrically observed this object and @xcite reported an unusual long - term repetitive light curve with a stable period ( it is now known as the supercycle ) of 19.2  d. @xcite reported that the behavior was different from a typical dwarf nova in that it showed short fading and brightening .",
    "@xcite reported a possible period of 21.167  d or 23.313  d and classified it to be a vy scl - type nl .",
    "a clue to understanding the unusual behavior of rz lmi came from the discovery of the su uma - type dwarf nova er uma with an ultrashort supercycle ( interval between superoutbursts ) of 43  d in 1994 @xcite .",
    "as orally presented in the conference held in abano terme , italy , 2024 june 1994 , robertson s team originally considered that the recurring nl - type bright state and the dwarf nova - type state in er uma and rz lmi was the best example to show the consequences of recurring mass - transfer bursts from the secondary . in this conference after robertson s presentation , however , y. osaki introduced kato and kunjaya s detection of superhumps in er uma and showed that the unusual behavior of er uma could be understood within the framework of the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite if one can allow an exceptionally high mass - transfer rate ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . after this conference , robertson s team published a paper following our interpretation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . after the discovery of superhumps in er uma and the recognition of the similarity between er uma and rz lmi",
    ", superhumps were naturally sought  the competition was intense : both @xcite and @xcite observed the same superoutburst in 1995 and detected superhumps .",
    "these observations confirmed that rz lmi does indeed belongs to the su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "these objects , together with v1159 ori , are usually called er uma - type stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of the ultrashort ( 19  d ) supercycle and the unusually regular outburst pattern remained a mystery .",
    "@xcite suspected a mechanism outside the disk in addition to the one in the disk .",
    "a later publication by @xcite followed the former possibility and suggested a third body . in the standard tti model , this short supercycle is difficult to reproduce , and @xcite presented a working hypothesis that in rz lmi the disk becomes thermally unstable during the superoutburst earlier than in other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite suggested , following the interpretation in @xcite , that in systems with very small mass ratios ( @xmath3 ) , the tidal torque is too small to maintain the superoutburst , and that there occurs a decoupling between the thermal and tidal instabilities .",
    "@xcite suggested that one of the consequences of this decoupling can be found as the persistent superhumps after superoutbursts .    according to the working hypotheses by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it is strongly predicted that the @xmath3 is small in rz lmi and that the disk radius after the superoutburst is larger than in other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "rz lmi , however , has defied every attempt to determine the orbital period , since it mostly stays in the `` outburst '' state and it is difficult to make a radial - velocity study in short quiescence .",
    "the almost continuous presence of superhumps also made it difficult to detect potential orbital variations by photometric methods . without the orbital period or a radial - velocity study , it remained impossible to observationally determine @xmath3 and the evolutionary status of rz lmi remained unclear despite its unusual outburst properties .",
    "the situation dramatically changed after the detection of a possible change in the outburst pattern in the aavso observations ( vsnet - alert 19524 ) .",
    "we have conducted a world - wide campaign to observe rz lmi during the 2016 season .",
    "the new development has also been helped by the classification of superhumps stage ( a , b and c : @xcite ) and identification of stage a superhumps representing the growing phase of superhumps at the radius of the 3:1 resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , key information and results",
    "are given in the main paper .",
    "the results not directly related to the conclusion of the paper , such as variation of superhump periods and variation of the profile of superhumps , are given in the supplementary information since they would provide useful information to expert readers .",
    "the data were obtained under campaigns led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite in 2016 .",
    "we also used the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data - download@xmath4 . ] .",
    "time - resolved photometric observations were obtained on 75 nights ( nights with more than 100 observations ) between february 25 and june 10 .",

    "we also performed time - resolved photometric observations during the period of 2013 march 5april 29 in 2013 at 9 sites .",
    "we also obtained snapshot observations ( several observations typically @xmath020 min apart ) on 47 nights between 2014 march 8 and may 22 .",
    "the logs of observations are given in e - tables .",
    "alphabetical abbreviated codes in the log are observer codes of aavso and they mean that the data were taken from the aavso database .",
    "we also used historical photographic data reported by @xcite ( listed as `` shugarov '' , who finally compiled all the data , in this paper ) .",
    "the data were analyzed just in the same way as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we mainly used r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath4 . ] for data analysis . in de - trending the data , we divided the data into four segments in relation to the outburst phase and used locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) .",
    "the times of superhumps maxima were determined by the template fitting method as described in @xcite .",
    "the times of all observations are expressed in barycentric julian days ( bjd ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rzlmihumpall2 ] illustrates the three consecutive superoutbursts in 2016 during which we obtained time - resolved photometric observations .",
    "the initial part of the light curve ( upper panel ) was the final fading part of the preceding superoutburst .",
    "there was only one normal outburst between the first and second superoutbursts .",
    "although the initial part of the first superoutburst was not well sampled , we found the superoutburst lasted for 26  d.    there were two normal outbursts between the second and the third superoutburst .",

    "the precursor part is clearly seen between bjd 2457483 and 2457484 . during this phase",
    ", superhumps rapidly grew to the maximum amplitude and they started to decay slowly ( lower panell ; see also figure [ fig : rzlmi2016rise ] for an enlargement ) .",

    "similar precursors were also recorded in snapshot observations of the first superoutburst and less markedly ( fewer observations ) during the third superoutburst .",

    "furthermore , @xcite already showed that the supercycle length once reaches the minimum as the mass - transfer rate ( @xmath5 ) increases , but that it lengthens again as @xmath5 further increases .",
    "as @xmath5 increases , the system eventually reaches the `` permanent outburst '' state ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) , bridging er uma - type objects and what is called permanent superhumpers ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the current state of rz lmi exactly reproduced this prediction , and it provides a strong support to explain the unusual short supercycles in er uma - type objects .",

    "if we consider that @xmath8 and @xmath12 are the same between different superoutbursts of rz lmi , we can estimate @xmath5 during the current state . using the parameters in @xcite , @xmath8=11.2  d and an assumption of a large disk radius at the end of a superoutburst @xmath12=0.42@xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the binary separation ,",

    "the current @xmath6 values of 26  d and 48  d require @xmath15=0.97 and 0.99 , respectively .",
    "although these estimates have uncertainties due to various assumptions , it is certain that the current state of rz lmi is _ critically _ close to the stability border .",
    "if rz lmi increases @xmath5 further by 1% , the object should become a permanent superhumper .",
    "as judged from these estimates , we have seen an almost complete transition from an er uma - type object to a permanent superhumper",

    "these two - dimensional lasso power spectra have been proven to be very effective in detecting signals in non - uniformly sampled ground - based data ( see e.g. @xcite ) since lasso - type period analysis is less affected by aliasing than traditional fourier - type power spectra .",

    "since the second superoutburst lasted very long , it may have been possible that negative superhumps were excited during this long - lasting standstill - like phase , which gives the condition almost the same as in permanent superhumpers ( see subsection [ sec : outburst ] ) .",

    "bk lyn returned back to its original novalike state in late 2013 and the er uma - type state was only transiently present @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the hypothetical cooling sequence from novalike objects ",
    "er uma - type dwarf novae ",
    "ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae after nova eruptions as proposed by @xcite is not very consistent with observational statistics , since such a cooling sequence would predict a large number of intermediate ( having much more slowly cooling white dwarfs ) objects between er uma - type dwarf novae and ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , while observations could not confirm a large number of such objects .",
    "as seen in er uma , bk lyn and rz lmi , the @xmath5 variations look more irregular with time - scales of several years and it looks like that the majority of variations in outburst activities in these systems does not reflect the secular @xmath5 variation as proposed by @xcite . as this paper has shown , the high activity of rz lmi may be a result of a rare evolutionary condition with a relatively massive secondary .",
    "in such a case , we may not require a nova eruption to produce an object like rz lmi .",
    "we observed rz lmi , which is renowned for the extremely ( @xmath019  d ) short supercycle and is a member of a small , unusual class of cataclysmic variable called er uma - type dwarf novae , in 2013 and 2016 . in 2016 , the supercycles of this object substantially lengthened in comparison to the previous measurements to 35 , 32 , 60  d for three consecutive superoutbursts .",
    "the durations of superoutbursts also lengthened and they composed 6081% of the supercycle .",
    "such long durations of superoutbursts have never been observed in this object , and we consider that the object virtually experienced a transition to the novalike state ( permanent superhumper ) .",
    "this observed behavior extremely well reproduced the prediction of the thermal - tidal instability model by @xcite .",
    "we estimated that in 2016 , the mass - transfer rate of rz lmi reached 9799% of the thermal stability limit , and that it was about two times larger than the value in the past .",
    "we detected a precursor in the 2016 superoutburst and detected growing ( stage a ) superhumps in 2016 and in 2013 .",
    "we estimated their period to be 0.0602(1 )  d. this makes the second case in er uma - type dwarf novae in which growing superhumps were confidently recorded during the sequence of the precursor and the main superoutburst .",
    "we also detected post - superoutburst superhumps immediately after a superoutburst in 2013 with a period of 0.05969(2 )  d. since both stage a superhumps and post - superoutburst superhumps can be considered to reflect the dynamical precession rates , we can derive the relation between the mass ratio and the radius of the post - superoutburst .",
    "the result suggests that the mass ratio is not as small as in wz sge - type dwarf novae , having orbital periods similar to rz lmi .    by using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) two - dimensional power spectra",
    ", we detected possible negative superhumps with a period of 0.05710(1 )  d. by combination with the period of ordinary superhumps , we estimated the orbital period of 0.05792  d. the period of stage a superhumps , combined with this orbital period , suggests a mass ratio of 0.105(5 ) .",
    "this relatively large mass ratio is consistent with the rapid growth of superhumps .",
    "this mass ratio is even above ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae , and it is also possible that the exceptionally high mass - transfer rate in rz lmi may be a result of a stripped core evolved secondary in a system evolving toward an am cvn - type object .",
    "an analysis of historical records of supercycles in this system suggests that the variation of the outburst activity is sporadic with time - scales of years and it does not seem to reflect the secular variation caused by evolution .",
