    "observation of the kondo effect in a quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite has stimulated researches in the field of quantum transport , and recent experimental developments enable one to examine the kondo physics in a variety of systems , such as an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring with a qd and double quantum dots ( dqd ) . in these systems",
    "multiple paths for electron propagation also affect the tunneling currents , and the interference causes fano - type asymmetric line shapes .",
    "superconductivity also brings rich and interesting features into the quantum transport .",
    "competition between superconductivity and the kondo effect has been reported to be observed in carbon nanotube qd and in semiconductor nanowires .",
    "@xcite furthermore , interplay between the andreev scattering and the kondo effect has been studied intensively for a qd coupled to a normal ( n ) lead and superconductor ( s ) , theoretically @xcite and experimentally .",
    "@xcite so far , however , the andreev - kondo physics has been discussed mainly for a single dot . in this paper",

    "@xcite golub and avishai calculated first , to our knowledge , the andreev transport through an ab ring with a qd,@xcite in which a similar interference effect is expected .",
    "however , the underlying kondo physics in such a combination with superconductivity and interference is still not fully understood , and is needed to be clarified precisely , as measurements are being not impossible .",
    "@xcite    we find that the coulomb interaction in the side dot ( qd2 in fig .",
    "[ modelndqdscom ] ) suppresses destructive interference typical of the t - shape geometry , and it enhances substantially the tunneling current between the normal and superconducting ( sc ) leads in the kondo regime .",
    "this is quite different from the behavior seen in the normal transport in the same configuration fig .",
    "[ modelndqdscom ] ( b ) , for which the conductance is suppressed , and shows a wide minimum called a kondo valley as a result of strong interference by the kondo resonance in the side dot .",
    "@xcite the sc proximity penetrating into the interfacial dot ( qd1 in fig .  [ modelndqdscom ] ) causes this stark contrast between the andreev and normal transports .",
    "it also changes the fano line shape in the gate - voltage dependence of the conductance .",
    "furthermore , we show that the proximity deforms the kondo cloud to make a singlet bond long , and it can be deduced from the fermi - liquid properties of the ground state .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model and describe the effective hamiltonian in a large gap limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show the numerical results and clarify the transport properties using the renormalized parameters .",
    "the fano structures in the gate - voltage dependence of the conductance are also discussed .",
    "a brief summary is given in the last section .",
    "we start with an anderson impurity connected to sc and normal leads , @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2 describes the interfacial ( @xmath3 ) and side ( @xmath4 ) dots : @xmath5 the energy level , @xmath6 the coulomb interaction , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 the inter - dot hopping matrix element . @xmath9 describes the sc / normal lead , and @xmath10 is a @xmath11-wave bcs gap .",
    "@xmath12 is the tunneling matrix element between qd1 and the sc / normal lead .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 is a constant independent of the energy @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of @xmath16 s in the leads . throughout the work , we concentrate on a large gap limit @xmath17 .",
    "then the starting hamiltonian @xmath18 can be mapped exactly onto a single - channel model , which still captures the essential physics of the andreev reflection and makes nrg approach efficient , @xcite @xmath19 note that at @xmath17 the real and virtual excitations towards the continuum states outside the gap in the sc lead are prohibited .",
    "nevertheless , the proximity from the sc lead to the dot remains finite , and it induces a local static pair potential @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) at qd1 .",
    "furthermore , the current can flow between the sc lead and the qd1 via @xmath22 .",
    "for ( a ) @xmath24 and ( b ) @xmath25 , for several side - dot repulsions @xmath26 . the parameters for qd1 are chosen to be @xmath27 , and @xmath28 which is the local sc gap defined by @xmath29 .",
    "]    we can calculate the conductance at zero temperature as a function of the level position @xmath23 of qd2 for different values of @xmath26 , using the kubo formula.@xcite in this paper we focus on the coulomb interaction in the side dot ( qd2 ) , assuming that @xmath30 in the following .",
    "the results of the conductance are shown in fig .",
    "[ con - ed2 ] for @xmath27 and @xmath31 .",
    "the coupling to the normal lead is chosen to be ( a ) @xmath24 and ( b ) @xmath25 .",
    "the conductance is enhanced for the kondo regime @xmath32 , where the wide kondo valley appears in the case of the normal transport .",
    "this is a novel phenomenon caused by the interplay between superconductivity and the kondo effect ; the local gap @xmath20 due to the proximity into qd1 leads to the andreev transport with destructive interference , but the introduction of @xmath26 suppresses the sc interference via qd2 , which in turn enhances the conductance .",
    "note that the couplings are symmetric @xmath33 for fig .",
    "[ con - ed2 ] ( a ) , and in this particular case the conductance increases with @xmath26 for any @xmath23 , except for the values @xmath34 and @xmath35 . outside of the kondo regime , the side dot is empty or doubly occupied , and the interference becomes no longer important . when the coupling to the normal lead is small @xmath36 as fig .",
    "[ con - ed2 ] ( b ) , the conductance in the kondo regime decreases after the peak reaches the unitary limit @xmath37 .",
    "this behavior can be related to a crossover from short - range to long - range kondo screening as illustrated in fig .",

    "we see that the peak shifts towards smaller @xmath22 as @xmath26 increases and will coincide in the limit of @xmath44 with the dashed line , which corresponds to the conductance without the side dot .",
    "it means that the interference caused by the side dot is suppressed completely for large @xmath26 , and in this limit the conductance reaches the unitary limit value for the symmetric couplings @xmath45 .",

    "the behavior of these fermi - liquid parameters implies that a crossover from weak to strong correlation regimes occurs around @xmath71 .",
    "the nature of the crossover can be related to a level crossing taking place in a _ molecule _",
    "limit @xmath59 , where qd1 is decoupled from the normal lead . in this limit",
    ", the isolated dqd is described by a hamiltonian @xmath72 , which includes the local sc gap @xmath29 at qd1 .",

    "[ all](b ) .",
    "the ground state is a spin - singlet , if either @xmath73 or @xmath43 is small . in the opposite case ,",
    "a spin - doublet becomes the ground state .",
    "the local moment in this doublet state emerges mainly at qd2 , because the correlation at qd1 is small in the present situation @xmath27 .",
    "we see in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ all](b ) that the transition takes place in this _ molecule _ limit at @xmath71 for @xmath57 , and it agrees well with the position where the conductance peak appears in fig .",
    "[ all](a ) .    for finite @xmath74",
    ", conduction electrons can tunnel from the normal lead to qd2 via qd1 .",
    "however , the sc correlation @xmath29 tends to make the local state at qd1 a singlet , which consists of a linear combination of the empty and doubly occupied states .",
    "thus , for large @xmath22 , the electrons at qd1 can not contribute to the screening of the moment at qd2 .",
    "in this situation , the kondo screening is achieved mainly by the conduction electrons tunneling to qd2 virtually via qd1 .",
    "this process is analogous to a superexchange mechanism , which can also be expected from the hamiltonian written in terms of the bogoliubov particles in appendix . from these observations we see that the conductance peak at @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ all](a ) reflects the crossover from the short - range singlet to long - range one due to the superexchange screening process ( see also fig .  [ modelndqdscom ] ) for the bogoliubov particles . note that the peak structure of the conductance vanishes for @xmath75 .",
    "the deformation of the kondo cloud can also be deduced from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ all](c ) .",
    "this is because the staggered pair correlation @xmath51 is related directly to the scattering phase shift @xmath52 of the bogoliubov particles , by the friedel sum rule eq .   given in appendix",
    ". therefore , the value of @xmath51 reflects the changes occurring in the kondo clouds . particularly , a sudden change observed in @xmath51 around @xmath71 shows that the phase of the wavefunction shifts by @xmath76 during this change .",
    "this also explains the occurring of the crossover from the short - range to long - range screening .",
    "we can also calculate each correlation function @xmath77 directly with nrg based on the definition .",
    "the local sc correlations @xmath54 and @xmath55 have the same value in the noninteracting case @xmath78 , and thus in this particular limit there is no reduction in the amplitude of the proximity from qd1 to qd2 .",
    "the coulomb interaction @xmath26 causes the reduction , as both @xmath54 and @xmath55 decrease for small @xmath26 where the ground state is a singlet with a _ molecule _ character . for large @xmath26 ,",
    "the sc correlation @xmath79 almost vanishes in qd2 , while @xmath54 shows an upturn and approaches the value expected for @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the sc proximity into qd1 is enhanced when the kondo cloud expands to form a long - range singlet .",
    "then the tunneling current is not interfered much by the local moment at qd2 , and flows almost directly without using the path to the side dot .       for several values of @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath57 .",
    "other parameters : ( a ) @xmath24 , @xmath83 .",

    "so far , we have chosen the level of qd1 to be @xmath85 .",
    "the result obtained for different values of @xmath81 is plotted as a function of @xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ con - ed2_extra ] .",
    "we see that two asymmetric fano structures , each of which consists of a pair of peak and dip , emerge at @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath80 , as the fermi level crosses the energy corresponding to the upper and lower levels of the atomic limit .",
    "the conductance peaks become sharper for @xmath62 as @xmath88 increases .",
    "et al _ studied the fano structure in the side - coupled dqd system with two normal leads,@xcite and showed that at low temperatures the conductance has only one pair of the peak and dip , which are separated widely by a fano - kondo plateau at @xmath89 .",
    "this type of the plateau was known earlier to appear in a qd embedded in an ab ring.@xcite in contrast , our result shows that the fano - kondo plateau vanishes , when one of the leads is a superconductor .",
    "this is because the kondo screening in this case is achieved by the long - range singlet bond due to the superexchange process , as a result of the competition between the sc proximity into qd1 and coulomb interaction at qd2 .",
    "we have studied andreev transport through the side - coupled dqd with nrg approach .",
    "we have found that the coulomb interaction in the side dot suppresses the destructive interference effect typical of the t - shape geometry , and enhances the tunneling current between the normal and sc leads .",
