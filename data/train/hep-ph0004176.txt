    "the experimental investigation of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions offers a unique possibility of studying the properties of strongly interacting matter at the high energy density when the hadronic matter is expected to become deconfined and a gas of asymptotically free quarks and gluons is formed .",
    "this is called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , in which the colour interactions between partons are screened owing to collective effects ( see , for example , reviews  @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    ", a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of `` hard '' probes of qgp  heavy quarkonia and hard partonic jets , which do not appear as constituents of the thermalized system , but can carry information about the earliest stages of its evolution . in particular , the strong suppression of yield of heavy quark vector mesons as @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 states ) and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 states ) is one of the promising signatures of the quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing phenomenon is the `` anomalously '' small yield of @xmath9-resonances , observed in pb - pb collisions in the na50 experiment ( cern - sps )  @xcite and inconsistent with the conventional model of pre - resonance absorption in cold nuclear matter .",
    "although the interpretation of this phenomenon as a result of the formation of a qgp is quite plausible  @xcite , alternative explanations have also been put forward , such , for example , as @xmath10 rescattering on comoving hadrons  @xcite .",
    "thus the nature of this `` anomalous '' suppression of @xmath9-resonance production is not yet fully understood , and it should be completely explained in future  @xcite . for heavier ( @xmath8 ) systems , a similar suppression effect in super - dense strongly interacting matter",
    "is expected at higher temperatures than for @xmath4 , which are expected to be reached in central collisions of heavy ions at the rhic at bnl and lhc at cern colliders .",
    "along with the suppression of heavy quarkonia , one of the processes which may give information about the earliest stages of evolution of the dense matter formed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions is the passage through the matter of hard jets of colour - charged partons , pairs of which are created at the very beginning of the collision process ( typically , at @xmath11 fm / c ) as a result of individual initial hard nucleon - nucleon ( parton - parton ) scatterings .",
    "such jets pass through the dense parton matter formed due to mini - jet production at larger time scales ( @xmath12 fm / c ) , and interact strongly with the comoving constituents in the medium , changing its original properties as a result of additional rescatterings .",
    "the inclusive cross section for hard jet production processes is still very small for performing a systematic analysis at the sps energies ( @xmath13 gev per nucleon pair ) , but it increases fast with the energy of collided nuclei .",
    "thus these will play important role in the formation of the initial state at the energies of rhic ( @xmath14 gev per nucleon pair ) and lhc ( @xmath15 tev per nucleon pair ) colliders .",
    "the actual problem is to study the energy losses of a hard jet evolving through the dense matter .",
    "we know two possible mechanisms of energy losses : @xmath16 radiative losses due to gluon `` bremsstrahlung '' induced by multiple scattering  @xcite and @xmath17 collisional losses due to the final state interactions ( elastic rescatterings ) of high @xmath18 partons off the medium constituents  @xcite .",
    "since the jet rescattering intensity strongly increases with temperature , formation of a super - dense and hot partonic matter in heavy ion collisions ( with initial temperature up to @xmath19 gev at lhc  @xcite ) should result in significantly larger jet energy losses as compared with the case of `` cold '' nuclear matter or hadronic gas at @xmath20 gev .",
    "although the radiative energy losses of a high energy parton have been shown to dominate over the collisional losses by up to an order of magnitude  @xcite , a direct experimental verification of this phenomenon remains an open problem .",
    "indeed , with increasing of hard parton energy the maximum of the angular distribution of bremsstrahlung gluons has shift towards the parent parton direction .",
    "this means that measuring the jet energy as a sum of the energies of final hadrons moving inside an angular cone with a given finite size @xmath21 will allow the bulk of the gluon radiation to belong to the jet and thus the major fraction of the initial parton energy to be reconstructed .",
    "therefore , the medium - induced radiation will , in the first place , soften particle energy distributions inside the jet , increase the multiplicity of secondary particles , but will not affect the total jet energy .",
    "it was recently shown  @xcite that the radiation of energetic gluons in a qcd medium is essentially different from the bethe - heitler independent radiation pattern .",
    "such gluons have formation times exceeding the mean free path for qcd parton scattering in the medium . in these circumstances",
    "the coherent effects play a crucial role leading to a strong suppression of the medium - induced gluon radiation .",
    "this coherent suppression is a qcd analogue of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect in qed .",
    "it is important to notice that the coherent lpm radiation induces a strong dependence of the jet energy on the jet cone size @xmath21  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the collisional energy losses represent an incoherent sum over all rescatterings .",
    "it is almost independent of the initial parton energy .",
    "meanwhile , the angular distribution of the collisional energy loss is essentially different from that of the radiative one .",
    "the bulk of `` thermal '' particles knocked out of the dense matter by elastic scatterings fly away in almost transverse direction relative to the hard jet axis . as a result",
    ", the collisional energy loss turns out to be practically independent on @xmath21 and emerges outside the narrow jet cone .",
    "thus the relative contribution of collisional losses would likely become significant for jets with finite cone size propagating through the qgp  @xcite .    in a search for experimental evidences in favour of the medium - induced energy losses a significant dijet quenching ( a suppression of high-@xmath18 jet pair yield )  @xcite and a monojet - to - dijet ratio enhancement",
    "@xcite were proposed as possible signals of dense matter formation in ultrarelativistic collisions of nuclei .",
    "other possible signatures that could directly measure the energy losses involve tagging the hard jet opposite a particle that does not interact strongly as a @xmath22-boson  @xcite ( mostly @xmath23 , but also @xmath24 ) or a photon  @xcite ( mostly @xmath25 , also @xmath26 ) .",
    "the jet energy losses in dense matter should result in the non - symmetric shape of the distribution of differences in @xmath27 between the z - boson ( @xmath28 ) and jet .",
    "the above phenomena can be studied in heavy ion collisions  @xcite with compact muon solenoid ( cms ) , which is the general purpose detector designed to run at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "note , that using @xmath29 channel in this case is complicated due to large background from @xmath30 production when one of the jet in an event is misidentified as a photon ( the leading @xmath31 ) .",
    "however the shape of the distribution of differences in @xmath32 between the @xmath28 and jet is very different for signal and background , and still sensitive to the jet energy losses  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of @xmath29 and @xmath33 channels is that one can determine the average initial transverse momentum of the hard jet , @xmath34 .",
    "it gives the attractive possibility to search for coherent effects in qcd - medium : the dependence of energy losses of the distance traversed can be studied experimentally in different bins of impact parameter distribution of nucleus - nucleus collision , or by varying collided ions and selecting the most central collisions .",
    "the intriguing prediction associated with the coherence pattern of the medium induced radiation is that radiative energy losses per unit distance @xmath35 depend on the total distance traversed @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath35 is approaching to being proportional to @xmath36 for static medium  @xcite , and it has weaker @xmath36-dependence for the case of expanding medium  @xcite . the main goal of the present paper is to analyze the possibility of observing the @xmath36-dependence of jet energy losses @xmath35 for realistic nuclear geometry . in particular , we are studying the impact parameter dependence of collisional and radiative jet energy losses in dense qcd - matter , created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "let us to consider the simple geometrical model of jet production and jet passing through a dense matter in high energy symmetric nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the figure 1 shows the essence of the problem in the plane of impact parameter * b * of two colliding nuclei @xmath37-@xmath37 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath0 here is the transverse distance between nucleus centers @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be denoted as a jet ( dijet ) production vertex , with @xmath42 being the distance from the nuclear collision axis to the @xmath43 .",
    "then the distance between nucleus centers ( @xmath44 ) and vertex @xmath43 can be found as @xmath45    the distribution over jet production vertex @xmath46 at given impact parameter @xmath0 is written as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the nuclear overlap function , @xmath49 is the nuclear thickness function with nucleon density distribution @xmath50 .",
    "the maximum possible value of @xmath42 in nuclear overlapping zone can be estimated from the equation @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the radius of the nucleus @xmath37 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath53 in particular , for the uniform nucleon density distribution , @xmath54 , the nuclear overlap function is equal to @xmath55 .",
    "then the distribution @xmath56 is proportional to @xmath57 for central @xmath58 collisions ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) we get simply @xmath61 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate the time @xmath62 it takes for jet to traverse the dense zone : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the azimuthal angle which determines the direction of a jet motion in the transverse plane , and @xmath65 is the angle between vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the expression for @xmath68 can be obtained from the condition @xmath69    finally , we are going to estimate the dependence of initial energy density in nuclear overlapping zone on impact parameter of the collision . at collider energies the minijet system ( the semi - hard gluons , quarks and antiquarks with @xmath70 gev / c ) in the central rapidity region is typically formed in parton - parton scatterings at very early times , @xmath71 fm / c , and it will then serve as initial condition for the further evolution of the system  @xcite . strictly speaking , the soft particle production mechanisms ( like the decay of the colour field ) can also contribute to initial conditions in nuclear interactions .",
    "however , the relative strength of soft part decreases strongly with increasing c.m.s .",
    "energy of the ion beams .",
    "in particular , at lhc energies @xmath72 tev@xmath73 per nucleon pair the hard and semi - hard processes contribute over @xmath74 to the transverse energy in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , soft processes with small momentum transfer @xmath75 mev@xmath76 @xmath77 can be partially or fully suppressed , owing to screening of the colour interaction in the dense parton matter produced from the system of minijets in the early stages of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at lhc energies , we will consider only dominant semi - hard contribution to the formation of initial state .",
    "the initial energy density inside the comoving volume of longitudinal size @xmath78 can be estimated using the bjorken formula  @xcite as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the effective transverse area of nuclear overlapping zone at impact parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the total initial transverse energy deposition in mid - rapidity region can be calculated  @xcite as @xmath81 where the first @xmath18-moment of inclusive differential minijet cross section @xmath82 is determined by the dynamics of nucleon - nucleon interactions at the corresponding c.m.s .",
    "then the dependence of initial energy density @xmath83 in nuclear overlapping zone on impact parameter @xmath0 has the form : @xmath84 or @xmath85 for central @xmath58 collisions we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is worth noting that although this simple geometrical model for jet production in nucleus - nucleus collisions is formally can be applicable up to impact parameter @xmath88 , the major informative domain of our interest is central and semi - central collisions with @xmath89 only .",
    "we have the following reasons in favour of this .",
    "\\1 ) the contribution of such events to total jet rate is dominant , although these events represent only a few percents of total inelastic @xmath58 cross section  @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath90 collisions with impact parameter @xmath91 fm contribute @xmath92 to the total dijet rate at lhc energy , their relative fraction of total cross section being only @xmath93 in this case  @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) in the most central heavy ion collisions the maximum initial energy density is expected to be achieved in a fairly large ( compared with typical hadronic scales ) volume , when the effect of super - dense and hot matter formation , like quark - gluon plasma , can be really observable .",
    "the result for impact parameter dependence of initial energy density @xmath83 ( [ eps_0 ] ) in nuclear overlapping zone for uniform nucleon density is shown in figure 2 : it is very weakly dependent of @xmath0 ( @xmath94 ) up to @xmath1 , and decreases rapidly at @xmath95 . on the other hand ,",
    "the averaged over all possible jet production vertices proper time @xmath96 ( [ taul ] ) of jet escaping from the dense zone is found to go down almost linearly with increasing impact parameter @xmath0 ( see the second curve in fig.2 ) .",
    "therefore the variation of impact parameter @xmath0 of nucleus - nucleus collision ( which can be measured , for example , using the total transverse energy deposition detected in different parts of calorimeters  @xcite ) up to @xmath1 gives the possibility to study jet quenching as a function of distance traversed without significant changing initial energy density @xmath83 .",
    "meanwhile , the weakness of @xmath0-dependence of @xmath83 gives us the advantage as compared with using of beams of different ions at a fixed bin of impact parameter distribution , when the scaling @xmath97 exists .",
    "eq.([eps_1 ] ) gives @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates changing of average time @xmath100 of jet travel and initial energy density @xmath83 in dense zone with variation of impact parameter @xmath0 ( at fixed @xmath101 , pb ) and atomic weight @xmath37 ( at fixed @xmath59 ) .",
    "for example , decreasing @xmath102 fm by the factor @xmath103 can be obtained by : + a ) increasing @xmath0 up to @xmath104 fm ( at the expense of only @xmath105 of @xmath83 reduction ) ; + b ) decreasing @xmath37 down to @xmath106 ( ca ) ( at the expense of @xmath83 reduction by the factor @xmath107 ) .",

    "the edge effects near the surface of the nucleus , impact parameter dependence of nuclear parton structure functions ( `` nuclear shadowing '' )  @xcite , early transverse expansion of the system and other potentially important phenomena for peripheral ( @xmath111 ) collisions are beyond our consideration here .",
    "the intensity of final state rescattering and collisional and radiative energy losses of hard jet partons in dense qcd - matter , created in nuclear overlapping zone , are sensitive to their initial parameters ( energy density , formation time ) and space - time evolution  @xcite . in order to analyze the impact parameter dependence of jet energy losses and jet quenching",
    ", we treat the medium as a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , and partons as being produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "we are expecting this is a adequate approximation for central and semi - central collisions for our semi - qualitative discourse .",
    "the approach relies on an accumulative energy losses , when both initial and final state gluon radiation is associated with each scattering in expanding medium together including the interference effect by the modified radiation spectrum as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath113 .",
    "note that recently the radiative energy losses of a fast parton propagating through expanding ( according to bjorken s model ) qcd plasma have been explicitly evaluated in  @xcite as @xmath114 with numerical factor @xmath115 @xmath116 for a parton created inside ( outside ) the medium , @xmath117 being the temperature at which the dense matter was left  @xcite .",
    "the total energy losses in transverse direction experienced by a hard parton due to multiple scattering in matter are the result of averaging over the jet production vertex @xmath118 ( [ vertex ] ) , the transfer momentum squared @xmath119 in a single rescattering and space - time evolution of the medium : @xmath120 here @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( [ taul ] ) are the proper time of the plasma formation and the time of jet escaping from the dense zone respectively ; @xmath123 is the density of plasma constituents of type @xmath0 at temperature @xmath124 ; @xmath125 is the integral cross section of scattering of the jet parton @xmath126 off the comoving constituent @xmath0 ( with the same longitudinal rapidity @xmath127 ) ; @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the thermal - averaged collisional energy loss of a jet parton due to single elastic scattering and radiative energy losses per unit distance respectively .",
    "if the mean free path of a hard parton is larger than the screening radius in the qcd medium , @xmath130 , the successive scatterings can be treated as independent  @xcite .",
    "the transverse distance between successive scatterings , @xmath131 , is determined in linear kinetic theory according to the probability density : @xmath132 where the mean inverse free path is given by @xmath133 .    the dominant contribution to the differential cross section @xmath134 for scattering of a parton with energy @xmath135 off the `` thermal '' partons with energy ( or effective mass ) @xmath136 at temperature @xmath124 can be written as  @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 for @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 scatterings respectively , @xmath142 is the qcd running coupling constant for @xmath143 active quark flavours , and @xmath144 is the qcd scale parameter which is of the order of the critical temperature , @xmath145 .",
    "the integrated parton scattering cross section , @xmath146 is regularized by the debye screening mass squared @xmath147 .",
    "the collisional energy losses due to elastic scattering with high - momentum transfer have been originally estimated by bjorken in  @xcite , and recalculated later in  @xcite taking also into account the loss with low - momentum transfer dominated by the interactions with plasma collective modes .",
    "since latter process contributes to the total collisional energy losses without the large factor @xmath148 in comparison with high - momentum scattering and it can be effectively `` absorbed '' by the redefinition of minimal @xmath149 under the numerical estimates , we shall concentrate on collisional energy losses with high - momentum transfer only  .",
    "the thermal average of such loss can be written as @xmath150 the value @xmath128 is independent of total distance traversed and determined by temperature , roughly @xmath151 .",
    "then total collisional energy losses integrated over whole jet path are estimated as @xmath152 , as it has been pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath122-dependence of @xmath153 can be weaker than linear for expanding medium ( @xmath154 for static matter ) .",

    "we have found that this @xmath0-dependence is very different for each mechanism due to coherent effects ( the dependence of radiative energy losses per unit distance @xmath35 of total distance traversed ) . as a consequence , the radiative losses are more sensitive to the impact parameter of nucleus - nucleus collision , which determines the effective volume of nuclear overlapping dense zone , and the space - time evolution of the medium .",
    "a possible way to directly observe the energy losses at different impact parameter ( or total detected @xmath32 deposition ) bins , involves tagging the hard jet opposite a particle that does not interact strongly , like in @xmath29 and @xmath249 production processes .",
    "since initial energy density @xmath83 in dense zone depends on @xmath0 very slightly ( @xmath250 ) up to @xmath1 , studying @xmath0-dependence appears to be advantageous than using of different ions at fixed impact parameter @xmath251 ( when @xmath252 ) .",
    "we hope that the separation of collisional and radiative contribution to total energy losses when doing the experimental data analysis for jets with finite cone size could be performed basing on essential difference in their angular distributions .",
    "another process of interest is high-@xmath18 jet pair production .",
    "the expected statistics for dijet rates in heavy ion collisions at lhc will be large enough to study the impact parameter dependence .",
    "since suppression of dijet yield ( jet quenching ) due to medium - induced energy losses should be much stronger in central collisions than in the peripheral one s , the maximum and mean values of @xmath238 distribution predicted to be shifted towards the larger @xmath0 .    finally , the study of the impact parameter dependences in the hard jet production processes ( @xmath194 , @xmath29 and @xmath253 channels ) is important for extracting information about the properties of super - dense qcd - matter to be created in heavy ion collisions at lhc",
