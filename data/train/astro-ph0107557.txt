    "it has been argued that cooling flows ( see fabian 1994 for a review ) are the natural state of cluster cores and that more than @xmath4 of clusters have flows depositing more than @xmath1  h@xmath5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 ( see e.g. peres et al .",
    "however , recent _ chandra _   and xmm results have not confirmed cooling flow rates calculated from simple models .",
    "the clearest discrepancy with the `` standard '' cooling flow model is obtained with the xmm - rgs : the spectra from cooling flow regions in clusters show a remarkable lack of emission lines from gas with @xmath8  kev ( peterson et al .",
    "2001 , kaastra et al .",
    "2001 , tamura et al .",
    "2001 ) . to explain the observed disagreement with `` simple '' cooling flow expectations , the above authors propose a number of possible physical mechanisms",
    "( see also fabian et al .",
    "one mechanism invoked to reduce the cooling rate is intracluster medium ( icm ) heating by powerful radio sources ( mainly agn ) in the nucleus of the central galaxy . among the several difficulties of such",
    "a scenario is that , to date , no cluster shows the icm heating taking place .",
    "we present the temperature map of the central @xmath0  kpc region of mkw3s derived from a deep _ chandra _   observation . even though mkw3s was previously identified as a moderate cooling flow cluster ( @xmath9 , peres et al .",
    "1998 ) , we argue that it shows evidence for hot gas bubbles which could be heated by agn activity of the central galaxy .",
    "we also show evidence for a cold filament similar to that seen by _",
    "chandra _   in a1795 ( fabian et al . 2000 ) but we defer to a later publication ( mazzotta et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) for a discussion .",
    "we use @xmath10  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 , which implies a linear scale of 1.21  kpc per arcsec at the distance of mkw3s ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "mkw3s was observed on april 2000 in acis - i with an exposure of @xmath12  ksec .",
    "we cleaned the data as in mazzotta et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "a background subtracted , vignetting corrected _ chandra _   image of the x - ray emission in the @xmath13  kev energy band , from mkw3s , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x - ray ] .",
    "the image reveals a surface brightness filament extending from the cluster center to the south - west and a circular - like depression south of the x - ray peak .",
    "both features are evident in the soft band ( @xmath14  kev ) as well as in the hard band ( @xmath15  kev ) indicating that they are produced by a significant gas density deviation rather than by excess absorption and/or gas temperature variations .",
    "the surface brightness depression lies at @xmath16  kpc ( @xmath17 ) from the x - ray peak and exhibits a circular shape with radius @xmath18  kpc ( @xmath19 . to check the statistical significance of the observed depression , we extracted the count rates from a circular region inscribed in the depression ( @xmath20 ; hereafter region s ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] ) and the count rates in two similar regions to the east and to the west of the depression .",
    "the absorbed flux from region s is @xmath21 lower than the flux from the neighboring regions at a @xmath22 confidence level .",
    "all spectral fits were made in the @xmath23  kev energy band .",
    "moreover , we multiplied the arfs by a constant factor 0.93 for @xmath24  kev ( vikhlinin 2000 ) .",
    "each spectrum was grouped to have a minimum of 25 counts per bin and fitted with an absorbed single - temperature thermal ( 1-t ) model ( mekal ) .",
    "we fixed @xmath25 to the galactic value ( @xmath26  @xmath27 ) and we leave , as free parameters , the temperature , the metal abundance , and the emission measure .",
    "our technique for temperature map determination is the same as that in vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray ( 2000 ) .",
    "we extracted images in 7 energy bands ( @xmath28  kev ) and smoothed the images with a gaussian filter whose width increased smoothly from @xmath29 at @xmath30 to @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "we determined the temperature by fixing @xmath25 at the galactic value and @xmath33 ( the best - fit average of the @xmath34  kpc region ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] we overlay the x - ray contours on the temperature map .",
    "to determine the accuracy of the temperature map , we fit the x - ray spectra in 9 selected regions ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] by numbers 1 to 9 ) with a 1-t model as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : regions ] .",
    "we derived the radial temperature profile of the entire cluster in twenty elliptical regions centered on the x - ray peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . for comparison",
    "we report the temperature profile derived from an xmm and an   observation of mkw3s ( ferrigno et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation , markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ) ; they are in excellent agreement .",
    "first , we performed a variety of spectral fits to clarify the nature of the surface brightness depression . by freeing @xmath25 in the spectral fit for the region s",
    "we find that it is consistent with the galactic value .",
    "hence , the depression is not produced by excess absorption but rather suggests the presence of a low gas density bubble along the line of sight .",
    "[ fig : profile ] shows that the projected temperature of region s ( solid diamond ) is higher than the average temperature at any other radius .",
    "the observed spectrum from region s may indicate either that the gas in the bubble is hotter than the ambient gas or that the emission from the bubble is dominated by a non - thermal component ( e.g. a power - law ) . to test the origin of the emission from the depression",
    ", we fit the spectrum using two simple spectral models : an absorbed two - temperature ( 2-t ) model and an absorbed 1-t plus a power - law model . for the first thermal component , we fixed the normalization to the estimated projected emission measure of the main cluster gas excluding a sphere of @xmath35  kpc located in the plane of the sky at 90  kpc from the cluster center .",
    "we also fixed @xmath25 to the galactic value and the temperature of the first thermal component to @xmath36  kev , the temperature of the regions adjacent to the depression .",
    "for the second component of the 2-t model , we find @xmath37 with @xmath38 for the power - law model we find @xmath39 @xmath40  mjy with @xmath41 ( here @xmath42  kev@xmath43 ) .",
    "both models fit the observed spectrum very well .          in fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] we overlay the x - ray contours on the digital sky survey ( dss ) image .",
    "the x - ray brightness peak coincides with the optical center of the cluster cd galaxy .",
    "the optical image shows no galaxy concentration coincident with either the filament or the x - ray surface brightness depression .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] we show the temperature map with overlaid vla radio ( 1.4  ghz ) contours .",
    "the radio image shows only two bright structures : the northern radio source is associated with the dominant cluster galaxy , the origin of the external source to the south is unclear .",
    "this source has a steep radio spectrum ( @xmath44 ; de breuck et al .",
    "2000 ) , but steep spectra are common both in cluster halos ( see e.g. giovannini , tordi , & feretti 1999 ) as well as in high redshift galaxies ( see e.g. de breuck et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if it is related to the cluster , it does not coincide with either the x - ray depression or with the x - ray filament .",
    "in this paper we concentrate our discussion on the nature of the x - ray surface brightness depression . in @xmath45",
    "we showed that the 1-t fit to the spectrum from region s gives a temperature higher than the radially averaged gas temperature at any radius .",
    "this higher temperature may indicate either that the gas in the bubble is hotter than the ambient gas or that the bubble is dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "unfortunately , simple spectral analysis does not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities since both thermal and non - thermal models give acceptable fits to the observed spectrum .",
    "thus , below we separately discuss the two possibilities and conclude that thermal emission is more likely .",
    "if the emission from the bubble is dominated by a power - law component , then it may be produced by inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of a power - law distribution of relativistic electrons with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons ( see e.g. harris & grindlay 1979 ) . if this is the case we should also expect synchrotron radio emission .",
    "the radio and the x - ray fluxes provide an estimate of the magnetic field strength in the bubble ( harris & grindlay 1979 ) . since the first image of mkw3s shows no significant radio emission associated with the bubble , at first we assume that the radio flux @xmath46 is equal to the survey detection limit : @xmath47  ghz@xmath48  mjy .",
    "in @xmath45 we showed that the x - ray spectral fit gives @xmath49  kev@xmath50  mjy and @xmath51 . using these values",
    "we find that @xmath52  gauss .",
    "assuming the same radio flux , we estimate the magnetic field strength using the minimum energy condition ( miley 1980 ) and we find @xmath53  gauss .",
    "the two magnetic field estimates show a great discrepancy as @xmath54 . because @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the above discrepancy is even worse if the actual radio flux is @xmath57  mjy .",
    "if we believe that the minimum energy condition is valid ( see e.g. readhead 1994 ) then it appears unlikely that the observed x - ray emission from the bubble can be produced by ic .",
    "moreover , from the upper limit on the radio flux , we estimate that the synchrotron energy density in the bubble is @xmath58 times the energy density of the cmb .",
    "thus , we also can exclude the possibility that the observed x - ray emission is produced by the synchrotron self compton process .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the emission from the low density bubble is more likely thermal . the exact determination of the gas temperature and density of the bubble depend on the actual shape and on the position of the bubble with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "let us assume that the bubble is a sphere and is located close to the plane of the sky . in @xmath45",
    "we showed that in this case the deprojected gas temperature is @xmath59  kev . using the difference between the flux in region s and the adjacent regions ,",
    "we estimate the ratio @xmath60 between the bubble gas density @xmath61 and the ambient gas density @xmath62 to be @xmath63 . if the bubble is at an angle @xmath64 with respect to the plane of the sky , then the contribution of the bubble to the total flux must decrease .",
    "thus , to obtain the observed depression , the ratio @xmath65 must be smaller ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "consequently the deprojected bubble gas temperature should be @xmath67  kev .",
    "by requiring @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) we can constrain the position of the bubble to @xmath70 .",
    "given the density of the bubble as a function of @xmath64 , we estimated the corresponding deprojected temperature and , thus , the pressure . by assuming that the temperature @xmath71 of the ambient gas outside the bubble is equal to @xmath72  kev ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) , we find that , for @xmath73 , the gas pressure @xmath74 in the bubble is 1 - 2 times larger than the pressure @xmath75 of the surrounding gas .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath76   it is not possible to derive an accurate estimate of the bubble pressure as its gas density goes rapidly to zero and the resulting deprojected temperature is not constrained .",
    "the above considerations strongly suggest that the gas in the bubble was heated , started to expand ( or is still expanding ) and , is now ( or soon will be ) in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding gas .",
    "it is not clear how the gas inside the bubble can have been heated to such a high temperature .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect that the bubble formed recently . if we assume that the bubble expands close to the sound speed , the bubble age is @xmath77  yr ,      the complex temperature structure and the non trivial ellipticity of the cluster core , suggest that the gas is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and/or mkw3s is undergoing a major merger .",
    "this last interpretation , however , is not supported by either the optical data or the x - ray surface brightness analysis which indicate that mkw3s is a relaxed system .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) show that mkw3s exhibits no substructure and that the galaxy velocity distribution is gaussian and unimodal .",
    "moreover the velocity of the cd galaxy is consistent with the cluster mean and the velocity dispersion is consistent with the cluster mean x - ray temperature .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray image does not show evident substructures . as shown by buote & tsai ( 1996 ) the power ratio @xmath78 of the multipole terms of order 2 and 0 , respectively ,",
    "represent a critical indicator of the cluster dynamical status : for mkw3s , this value is consistent with those of many relaxed systems and significantly lower of those of well known merger clusters .",
    "one possible mechanism for heating gas in the bubble is energy injection arising from activity in the nucleus of the cd galaxy .",
    "this scenario , however , seems to be inconsistent with the radio map that shows no sign of strong nuclear activity ( see @xmath79 ) .",
    "however , we may be observing a cluster in which the black hole in the central galaxy undergoes short intervals ( @xmath80  yr ) of strong activity followed by periods ( @xmath81  yr ) of relative quiescence ( e.g. binney & tabor 1995 , soker et al . 2000 ) .",
    "such a scenario suggests that the bubble was heated during the last radio burst .",
    "if this interpretation is correct and the gas was heated by radio jets , then the hot regions on the north side of the cd galaxy ( labeled as regions 2 and 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] ) may have been heated by a northern jet component .",
    "the fact that we do not detect a significant corresponding surface brightness depression suggests that the outburst was strongly asymmetric .",
    "moreover , intermittent energy injection can contribute to form the observed temperature asymmetry in the core of mkw3s ( see churazov et al . 2000 for a discussion of the evolution of buoyant bubbles in cluster atmospheres ) .",
    "finally , the discovery of this heated low - density gas bubble assumes a particular importance as it clearly shows heating taking place in the cluster core region ( previously identified as a cooling flow region ) of an apparently `` relaxed '' cluster . if widespread , such gas heating mechanisms may contribute to substantially reduce the cooling rate and may explain the absence of emission lines from cool ( @xmath82  kev or below ) gas in recent cluster observations .",
    "furthermore , we should expect to find them in other relaxed clusters which would clearly differentiate among the possibilities for their origin .",
