    "consider a vector space @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "delzant shows that each @xmath2-dimensional simple convex polytope @xmath3 , rational with respect to a lattice in @xmath1 and satisfying an additional integrality condition , is the image of a symplectic toric manifold via moment mapping .",
    "the result is obtained by providing an explicit construction of such a manifold , which coincides in fact with the toric variety associated to the polytope and is naturally endowed with a symplectic structure whose symplectic volume is equal to the euclidean volume of the polytope . in @xcite prato extends delzant s result to the nonrational setting , constructing , for each @xmath2-dimensional simple convex polytope @xmath3 , _ rational or not _ , a family of @xmath4-dimensional compact symplectic spaces , called _ quasifolds _ , naturally associated to @xmath5 .",
    "each space of the family admits the effective hamiltonian action of an @xmath2-dimensional _ quasitorus _ @xmath6 , with a moment mapping whose image is exactly @xmath5 .",
    "a quasifold is a topological space locally modelled on @xmath0 modulo the action of a discrete , possibly infinite , group , and therefore it is not necessarily hausdorff .",
    "a quasitorus is the natural analogue of a torus in this setting , it is the group and quasifold @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a quasilattice .",
    "the idea underlying the present paper is that in order to extend these results to arbitrary convex polytopes , neither simple , nor rational , quasifolds are still the natural structures but a further degree of singularity has to be allowed , just as in the case of classical toric varieties , in which nonsimplicity of the polytope brings in singularities which are not finite group quotient type .",
    "we therefore introduce spaces stratified by quasifolds : nonsimplicity of the polytope causes the decomposition in strata of the corresponding topological spaces , whilst nonrationality of @xmath5 produces the quasifold structure of the strata and intervenes in the way strata are glued to each other , leading to a definition of stratification that naturally extends the usual one . more precisely we prove that to each @xmath2-dimensional convex polytope @xmath3 , there corresponds a family of compact spaces that are stratified by symplectic quasifolds .",
    "different members of the family correspond , like in @xcite , to different choices of additional data attached to @xmath5 .",
    "each space @xmath9 of the family admits the continuous effective action of an @xmath2-dimensional quasitorus @xmath6 and a continuous mapping @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "the restriction of the @xmath6-action to each stratum is smooth and hamiltonian , with moment mapping given by the restriction of @xmath12 .",
    "the proof is based on the explicit construction of @xmath9 as symplectic quotient ; the stratification of @xmath9 is the one naturally induced by the decomposition by isotropy type , it is , in other words , the decomposition by singularity type and mirrors , as we shall see , the decomposition of the polytope in singular and nonsingular faces .",
    "moreover , as in the rational case , the local structure of the stratification reflects the polytope shape .",
    "if we restrict to the rational case we obtain , from the point of view of singularities , what expected from the classical theory of toric varieties , in addition we gain further insight on the symplectic geometry of them ; it should also be noticed that these spaces provide a wide range of explicit examples of symplectic stratified spaces as defined in @xcite ( further details in remark  [ choices ] ) .    in the present paper , whose results",
    "have been announced , jointly with elisa prato , in @xcite , the spaces corresponding to arbitrary convex polytopes are described in the symplectic setting . they have a complex counterpart , strictly related to the theory of toric varieties ( for further details cf .",
    "remark  [ complex ] ; for the extension of the notion of toric variety to simple nonrational convex polytope see @xcite ) .",
    "this aspect will be treated in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "recent works by karu and bressler - lunts deal with arbitrary convex polytopes from another viewpoint . in order to prove the hard - lefschetz theorem ( @xcite ) and hodge - riemann bilinear relations ( @xcite ) for nonrational convex polytopes , they make use of a combinatorial construction , from the polytope data , of the intersection cohomology , thus bypassing the problem of the existence of a `` variety '' associated to @xmath5 .",
    "what we provide in here is on the contrary an explicit construction of a geometric space , indeed of a whole family of geometric spaces , that naturally correspond to @xmath5 .",
    "the geometry and topology of our spaces and the relationship with properties of the corresponding polytope  volume , counting integer lattice points , hard lefschetz  are all very natural questions related to our work .",
    "a first step towards a better understanding of these different aspects , that will be pursued in the sequel , is to investigate cohomological properties of our spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a preliminary section in which we recall the basics about quasifolds , we give in section",
    "@xmath13 the definition of space stratified by quasifolds . in section  @xmath14",
    "we explicitly construct , adopting the procedure introduced by delzant in @xcite and extended to the nonrational case by prato in @xcite , a family of topological spaces naturally associated to a convex polytope @xmath5 . in the last two sections we describe the structure of these spaces , by proving that they are spaces stratified by symplectic quasifolds . to guide the exposition we provide two model examples worked out in detail .",
    "* acknowledgments*. this work began in collaboration with elisa prato and the results presented here have been announced in the joint paper @xcite .",
    "the project developed in these works was initiated by prato s article @xcite and then carried on jointly in @xcite .",
    "i am very grateful to elisa prato for having introduced me to the beautiful subject of quasifolds  working together has been an enrichening experience .",
    "in this section we recall basic definitions about quasifolds , for further details and for related notions , such as symplectic forms and hamiltonian actions , we refer the reader to prato s article @xcite .    the local model for quasifolds is a manifold acted on diffeomorphically by a discrete group .",
