    "<S> we explore the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the hadron tensor of the drell - yan process with one transversely polarized hadron . due to the special role of the contour gauge for gluon fields , the prescription for the gluonic pole in the twist @xmath0 correlator </S>",
    "<S> can be related to the causality prescriptions for exclusive hard processes . </S>",
    "<S> because of this , we find the extra contributions , which naively do not have an imaginary phase . </S>",
    "<S> the single spin asymmetry for the drell - yan process is accordingly enhanced by the factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction*. the problem of the electromagnetic gauge invariance in the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and similar exclusive processes has intensively been discussed during last few years , see for example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this development explored the similarity with the earlier studied inclusive spin - dependent processes @xcite , and the transverse component of momentum transfer in dvcs corresponds to the transverse spin in dis . here </S>",
    "<S> we combine the different approaches to apply them in the relevant case of the drell - yan ( dy ) process where one of hadrons is the transversally polarized nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the source of the imaginary part , when one calculates the single spin asymmetry associated with the dy process , is the quark propagator in the diagrams with quark - gluon ( twist three ) correlators . </S>",
    "<S> this leads @xcite to the gluonic pole contribution to ssa . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that these boundary conditions provide the purely real quark - gluon function @xmath1 which parameterizes @xmath2 matrix element . by this fact the diagrams with two - particle correlators </S>",
    "<S> do not contribute to the imaginary part of the hadron tensor related to the ssa @xcite . in our paper </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a thorough analysis of the transverse polarized dy hadron tensor in the light of the qed gauge invariance , the causality and gluonic pole contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in contrast to the naive assumption , our new - found additional contribution is directly related to the certain complex prescription in the gluonic pole @xmath3 of the quark - gluon function @xmath1 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and see e.g.@xcite and refs . therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the account for this extra contributions corrects the ssa formula for the transverse polarized drell - yan process by the factor of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> note that our analysis is also important in view of the recent investigation of dy process within both the collinear and the transverse - momentum factorization schemes with hadrons replaced by on - shell parton states @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * causality and contour gauge for the gluonic pole*. we study the contribution to the hadron tensor which is related to the single spin ( left - right ) asymmetry measured in the drell - yan process with the transversely polarized nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the dy process with the transversely polarized target manifests @xcite the gluonic pole contributions . </S>",
    "<S> since we perform our calculations within a _ collinear _ factorization , it is convenient ( see , e.g . , @xcite ) to fix the dominant light - cone directions for the dy process shown at fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - dy ] @xmath5 . focusing on the dirac vector projection , containing the gluonic pole , </S>",
    "<S> let us start with the standard hadron tensor generated by the diagram depicted on fig . </S>",

    "<S> i.e _ @xmath10 in the trace , we may conclude that ( i ) the @xmath11 term singles out @xmath12 with @xmath13 which will lead to @xmath14 giving the contribution to ssa ; ( ii ) the @xmath15 term separates out @xmath16 with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this term will give @xmath18 which will be exponentiated in the wilson line @xmath19 $ ] ; ( iii ) the @xmath20 term separates out @xmath21 with @xmath13 and , then , will be exponentiated in the wilson line @xmath22 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> this is exactly what happens in the spin - averaged dy process . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the ssa we are interested in , these two ( direct and mirror ) diagrams have to be considered individually . their contributions to ssas differ in sign and the dependence on the boundary point at @xmath30 does _ not _ cancel . to eliminate the unphysical gluons from our consideration and use the factorization scheme @xcite , we may choose a _ contour _ gauge @xcite @xmath31=1 \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which actually implies also the axial gauge @xmath32 used in @xcite . imposing this gauge one arrives @xcite at the following representation of the gluon field in terms of the strength tensor : @xmath33 moreover , if we choose instead an alternative representation for the gluon in the form with @xmath34 , keeping the causal prescription @xmath35 in ( [ hadten1 - 2 ] ) , the cost of this will be the breaking of the electromagnetic gauge invariance for the dy tensor . </S>",
    "<S> consider now the term with @xmath11 in ( [ hadten1 - 2 ] ) which gives us finally the matrix element of the twist @xmath0 operator with the transverse gluon field . </S>",
    "<S> the parametrization of the relevant matrix elements is @xmath36 using the representation ( [ ag ] ) , this function can be expressed as @xmath37 where the real regular function @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) parametrizes the vector matrix element of the operator involving the tensor @xmath40 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : @xmath41 owing to the time - reversal invariance , the function @xmath42 , @xmath43 can be chosen as @xmath44 . indeed , the function @xmath1 is an antisymmetric function of its arguments @xcite , while the anti - symmetrization of the additional term with @xmath42 gives zero . </S>",
    "<S> if the only source of the imaginary part of the hadron tensor is the quark propagator , one may realize this property by assumption : @xmath45 corresponding to asymmetric boundary condition for gluons @xcite : @xmath46 . here </S>",
    "<S> we suggest another way of reasoning . </S>",
    "<S> the causal prescription for the quark propagator , generating its imaginary part , simultaneously leads to the imaginary part of the gluonic pole . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this does not mean the appearance of imaginary part of matrix element but rather the prescription of its convolution with hard part ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fixed complex prescription @xmath35 in the gluonic pole of @xmath1 ( see , ( [ sol - way-1 ] ) ) is one of our main results and is very crucial for an extra contribution to hadron tensor we are now ready to explore . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the gauge condition must be the same for all the diagrams , and it leads to the appearance of imaginary phase of the diagram ( see , fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig - dy](b ) or , in other words , the use of the qed gauge non - invariant hadron tensor yields the error of the factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions and discussions*. shortly summarizing , we want to notice that if we start to work within the axial ( light - cone ) gauge , without any referring to the contour gauge , we have to sort out all possible prescriptions in order to choose such ones which are in agreement with the gauge invariance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , if we  blindly \" work within the axial ( light - cone ) gauge , in order to get the gauge invariance , we are forced to introduce a such specific subject as the so - called special propagator _ a la _ j.w.qiu . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . on the other hand , having considered the axial gauge as a particular case of the path - dependent contour gauge , we have no ambiguities with the prescriptions which automatically agree with the gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the practical issue of that the gauge invariance has been restored is the new - found factor of @xmath4 in the expression for ssa in the transverse polarized drell - yan process .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we showed that it is mandatory to include a contribution of the extra diagram which naively does not have an imaginary part . </S>",
    "<S> the account for this extra contribution leads to the amplification of ssa by the factor of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this additional contribution emanates from the complex gluonic pole prescription in the representation of the twist @xmath0 correlator @xmath1 which , in its turn , is directly related to the complex pole prescription in the quark propagator forming the hard part of the corresponding hadron tensor . the causal prescription in the quark propagator , involved in the hard part of the diagram on fig.[fig - dy](a ) , selects from the physical axial gauges the contour gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that , in addition to the electromagnetic gauge invariance , the inclusion of new - found contributions corrects by the factor of @xmath4 the expression for ssa in the transverse polarized drell - yan process . </S>",
    "<S> we proved that the complex prescription in the quark propagator forming the hard part of the hadron tensor , the starting point in the contour gauge , the fixed representation of @xmath1 and the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the hadron tensor must be considered together as the deeply related items . </S>",
    "<S> in recent work @xcite , the factor @xmath64 instead of @xmath4 has been claimed . </S>",
    "<S> so , in addition to the sign puzzle , do we have a factor of @xmath4 puzzle ? ! </S>"
