    "the study of b physics is essential to determine the flavor structure of the standard model , through knowledge of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix describing quark mixing and cp violation , which may be associated with the lack of symmetry between matter and anti - matter in the universe .",
    "in fact , since the amount of baryons in the universe predicted using the ckm mechanism is several orders of magnitude smaller than what is observed by astronomers , extensions of the standard model propose additional sources of cp violation , which must be tested against standard - model predictions .",
    "b mesons provide the ideal environment for such tests.@xcite in particular , high - precision theoretical inputs are needed for hadronic matrix elements , which may be computed starting from the gauge theory itself using numerical simulations of lattice qcd . at present , however , it is not yet feasible to perform simulations on lattices that can simultaneously represent the two relevant scales of b physics : the low energy scale @xmath0 , requiring large physical lattice size , and the high energy scale of the b - quark mass @xmath1 , requiring very small lattice spacing @xmath2 . an approximate framework is therefore needed , but one should strive to achieve sufficiently precise results , otherwise the task of overconstraining the parameters of the standard model is compromised .    a promising such framework is to consider ( lattice ) heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) , which allows for an elegant theoretical treatment , with the possibility of fully nonperturbative renormalization.@xcite the approach is briefly described as follows .",
    "hqet provides a valid low - momentum description for systems with one heavy quark , with manifest heavy - quark symmetry in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the heavy - quark flavor and spin symmetries are broken at finite values of @xmath1 respectively by kinetic and spin terms , with first - order corrections to the static lagrangian parametrized by @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 these @xmath8 corrections are incorporated by an expansion of the statistical weight in @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , @xmath11 are treated as insertions into static correlation functions .",
    "this guarantees the existence of a continuum limit , with results that are independent of the regularization , provided that the renormalization be done nonperturbatively .    as a consequence ,",
    "expansions for masses and decay constants are given respectively by @xmath12 and @xmath13 where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are written as sums of a static and an @xmath8 term ( denoted respectively with the superscripts `` @xmath16 '' and `` @xmath9 '' below ) , and @xmath17 is of order @xmath9 .",
    "bare energies ( @xmath18 , etc . ) and matrix elements ( @xmath19 , etc . )",
    "are computed in the numerical simulation .",
    "the divergences ( with inverse powers of @xmath2 ) in the above parameters are cancelled through the nonperturbative renormalization , which is based on a matching of hqet parameters to qcd on lattices of small physical volume  where fine lattice spacings can be considered  and extrapolation to a large volume by the step - scaling method . such an analysis has been recently completed for the quenched case.@xcite in particular , there are nonperturbative ( quenched ) determinations of the static coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 for hyp1 and hyp2 static - quark actions@xcite at the physical b - quark mass , and similarly for the @xmath8 parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath17 .",
    "the newly determined hqet parameters are very precise ( with errors of a couple of a percent in the static case ) and show the expected behavior with @xmath2 .",
    "they are used in our calculations reported here , to perform the nonperturbative renormalization of the ( bare ) observables computed in the simulation .",
    "of course , in order to keep a high precision , also these bare quantities have to be accurately determined .",
    "this is accomplished by an efficient use of the generalized eigenvalue problem ( gevp ) for extracting energy levels @xmath24 and matrix elements , as described below .",
    "a significant source of systematic errors in the determination of energy levels in lattice simulations is the contamination from excited states in the time correlators @xmath25 of fields @xmath26 with the quantum numbers of a given bound state .    instead of starting from simple local fields @xmath27 and",
    "getting the ( ground - state ) energy from an effective - mass plateau in @xmath28 as defined above , it is then advantageous to consider all - to - all propagators@xcite and to solve , instead , the gevp @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath28 is now a matrix of correlators , given by @xmath31 the chosen interpolators @xmath32 are taken ( hopefully ) linearly independent , e.g.  they may be built from the smeared quark fields using @xmath33 different smearing levels .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath34 are defined by @xmath35    one thus computes @xmath36 for the interpolator basis @xmath32 from the numerical simulation , then gets effective energy levels @xmath37 and estimates for the matrix elements @xmath34 from the solution @xmath38 of the gevp at large @xmath39 . for the energies",
    "@xmath40 it is shown@xcite that @xmath41 converges exponentially as @xmath42 ( and fixed @xmath43 ) to the true energy @xmath24 .",
    "however , since the exponential falloff of higher contributions may be slow , it is also essential to study the convergence as a function of @xmath43 in order to achieve the required efficiency for the method .",
    "this has been recently done,@xcite by explicit application of ( ordinary ) perturbation theory to a hypothetical truncated problem where only @xmath33 levels contribute .",
    "the solution in this case is exactly given by the true energies , and corrections due to the higher states are treated perturbatively .",
    "we get    @xmath44    for the energies and @xmath45 for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , which may be estimated through @xmath46 r_n & = & { \\left(v_n(t , t_0)\\,,\\ , c(t)\\,v_n(t , t_0)\\right)}^{-1/2 } \\ ; \\left[{\\lambda_n(t_0+a , t_0 ) \\over \\lambda_n(t_0 + 2a , t_0)}\\right]^{t/2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in our analysis we see that , due to cancellations of @xmath39-independent terms in the effective energy , the first - order corrections in @xmath47 are independent of @xmath43 and very strongly suppressed at large @xmath39 .",
    "we identify two regimes : 1 ) for @xmath48 , the 2nd - order corrections dominate and their exponential suppression is given by the smallest energy gap @xmath49 between level @xmath50 and its neighboring levels @xmath51 ; and 2 ) for @xmath52 , the 1st - order corrections dominate and the suppression is given by the large gap @xmath53 .",
    "amplitudes @xmath54 get main contributions from the first - order corrections . for fixed @xmath55 these are also suppressed with @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , the appearance of large energy gaps in the second regime improves convergence significantly .",
    "we therefore work with @xmath39 , @xmath43 combinations in this regime .",
    "a very important step of our approach is to realize that the same perturbative analysis may be applied to get the @xmath9 corrections in the hqet correlation functions mentioned previously @xmath56 where the combined @xmath8 corrections are symbolized by the expansion parameter @xmath57 .",
    "following the same procedure as above , we get similar exponential suppressions ( with the static energy gaps ) for static and @xmath8 terms in the effective theory .",
    "we arrive at @xmath58 with @xmath59      e_n^{\\rm eff,\\first}(t , t_0 ) & = &      e_n^{\\first } \\,+\\ , [ \\,\\beta_n^{\\first }      \\,-\\ , \\beta_n^{\\stat}\\,t\\;\\delta e_{n+1,n}^{\\first}\\ , ]      { \\rm e}^{-\\delta e_{n+1,n}^{\\stat}\\ , t}+\\ldots\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for matrix elements .",
    "preliminary results of our application of the methods described in this section were presented recently@xcite and are summarized in the next section .",
    "a more detailed version of this study will be presented elsewhere.@xcite",
    "we carried out a study of static - light b@xmath60-mesons in quenched hqet with the nonperturbative parameters described in the previous section , employing the hyp1 and hyp2 lattice actions for the static quark and an @xmath61-improved wilson action for the strange quark in the simulations .",
    "the lattices considered were of the form @xmath62 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we took @xmath63 fm and lattice spacings @xmath64 fm , @xmath65 fm and @xmath66 fm , corresponding respectively to @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we used all - to - all strange - quark propagators constructed from approximate low modes , with 100 configurations .",
    "gauge links in interpolating fields were smeared with 3 iterations of ( spatial ) ape smearing , whereas gaussian smearing ( 8 levels ) was used for the strange - quark field .",
    "a simple @xmath70 structure in dirac space was taken for all 8 interpolating fields .",
    "also , the local field ( no smearing ) was included in order to compute the decay constant .",
    "the resulting ( @xmath71 ) correlation matrix may be conveniently truncated to an @xmath72 one and the gevp solved for each @xmath33 , so that results can be studied as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "we then pick a basis from unprojected interpolators , by sampling the different smearing levels ( from 1 to 7 ) as @xmath73,@xmath74 , etc .",
    "we perform fits of the various energy levels and values of @xmath33 to the behavior in eq .",
    "( [ effenergies ] ) and extract our results from the predicted plateaus .",
    "next , we take the continuum limit , extrapolating our results to @xmath75 .",
    "we see that the correction to the ground - state energy due to terms of order @xmath9 , which is positive for finite @xmath2 , is quite small ( consistent with zero ) in the continuum limit .",
    "our results for the pseudoscalar meson decay constant , both in the static limit and including @xmath8 corrections , are shown in terms of the combination @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a known matching function and @xmath78 denotes the renormalization - group - invariant matrix element of the static axial current.@xcite these two continuum extrapolations are shown in comparison with fully relativistic heavy - light ( around charm - strange ) data@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbs_comp ] below .",
    "note that , up to perturbative corrections of order @xmath79 in @xmath80 , hqet predicts a behavior @xmath81 in this graph .",
    "surprisingly no @xmath82 terms are visible , even with our rather small errors .       .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the combined use of nonperturbatively determined hqet parameters ( in action and currents ) and efficient gevp allows us to reach precisions of a few percent in matrix elements and of a few mev in energy levels , even with only a moderate number of configurations .",
    "the method is robust with respect to the choice of interpolator basis .",
    "all parameters have been determined nonperturbatively and in particular power divergences are completely subtracted .",
    "we see that hqet plus @xmath8 corrections at the b - quark mass agrees well with an interpolation between the static point and the charm region , indicating that linearity in @xmath83 extends even to the charm point .",
