    "prompt ( panchromatic robotic optical monitoring and polarimetry telescopes ) is a robotic telescope system that will provide well sampled multiwavelength light curves and polarization histories of grb afterglows beginning only seconds after spacecraft notification . when completed in late 2005 , prompt will consist of six 0.41-meter ritchey - chrtien telescopes by rc optical systems on rapidly slewing paramount me mounts by software bisque .",
    "each mirror and camera coating is being optimized for a different wavelength range and function , including a nir imager , two red - optimized imagers , a blue - optimized imager , an uv - optimized imager , and an optical polarimeter .",
    "the nir imager is a ln2-cooled microcam by rockwell scientific , which uses a picnic 256 @xmath0 256 hgcdte fpa ( same as nicmos3 ) and will have a 5 field of view and 1.2 `` pixels . the optical imagers are alta u47@xmath1s by apogee , which use back - illuminated e2v 1024 @xmath0 1024 ccds with @xmath21-second readout times and will have 10 fields of view and 0.6 '' pixels .",
    "the optical polarimeter consists of a fresnel rhomb @xmath1 wollaston prism assembly that we are designing and building at the abraham goodman laboratory for astronomical instrumentation at the university of north carolina at chapel hill .",
    "it will produce two orthogonally polarized 5 fields of view on another alta u47 + .",
    "stokes parameters for linear polarization are measured from the ratio of the images for different rotation angles of the fresnel rhomb .",
    "prompt s six imager design ( counting the polarimeter ) will allow the ugrr@xmath3izjh sfd of the afterglow to be reconstructed , modulo a small , calibration - induced slope when non - photometric , after only two , mostly redundant exposure sets  regardless of potentially great variations in the early - time light curve  simply by repeating ( preferably long - wavelength ) filters across consecutive exposure sets : with only two cameras at least seven exposure sets would be needed , and with only one camera this would not be possible until after the afterglow settled into an easy - to - model behavior .",
    "from the reconstructed sfd the redshift of the grb can be estimated from dropout , and because of the eight - band coverage the dropout signature can be distinguished from the similar but broader signatures of extinction by dust , both in our galaxy and in the host galaxy , using the extinction - curve , ly@xmath4-forest , and lyman - limit models of  @xcite .",
    "since the possibility of an early - time color transition might cause confusion , the technique will be repeated to confirm the result .",
    "prompt s polarimeter will also forge new ground .",
    "when we first proposed to build a robotic polarimeter , polarizations of only a few percent had been measured , and then only at intermediate and late times . however , since then the solar gamma - ray spacecraft rhessi s serendipitous detection of grb 021206 resulted in a polarization measurement for the grb of ( 80 @xmath5 20)% ( @xcite ; however , see  @xcite ) , which suggests that the jet that produces the grb , at least initially , might not be completely hydrodynamically driven , but rather might have a magnetically driven component through an almost completely ordered field .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the reverse shock , which is most likely responsible for the prompt optical emission , would propagate back through this highly ordered field and consequently the prompt emission would be similarly polarized ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the optical polarization might actually be highest , and potentially extremely so , right when the afterglow is brightest , and potentially extremely so  and consequently almost trivial to measure if one has a robotic polarimeter . when completed , prompt will be able to measure optical polarizations beginning only @xmath220 seconds after the burst , while many of the long - duration grbs are still bursting .",
    "the construction of prompt s first four telescopes is well timed with the beginning of operations for swift .",
    "swift will revolutionize the grb field for the second time in eight years : swift is expected to localize @xmath6100 grbs per year with localizations accurate to 1  4 relayed to observers on the ground within @xmath215 seconds of the burst and localizations accurate to many arcseconds relayed within minutes of the burst .",
    "swift will also localize relatively unextinguished , @xmath7 grbs ( probably about half of their long - duration / soft - spectrum grbs ) to a few tenths of an arcsecond on a longer timescale with uvot . the expected rate of grbs that will be observable from the prompt site ( i.e. , that occur sufficiently above the horizon when the sun is below the horizon and the weather is acceptable ) during the swift era ( including hete-2 , integral , ipn , etc . ) is @xmath615 per year that will be observable within minutes of the burst and another @xmath630 per year that will be observable on longer timescales as the earth rotates the grb field above the horizon and/or the sun below the horizon . of the @xmath615 grbs per year that prompt will observe on the rapid timescale , @xmath62 or 3 are expected to be at redshifts greater than 5 and @xmath61 is expected to be more distant than the most distant object in the universe yet identified , based on various best guesses about the star - formation rate at high redshifts ( e.g. ,  @xcite ;  @xcite ;  @xcite ) . over an extended mission",
    ", we expect to detect and identify grbs with redshifts as high as @xmath610  15 , reaching back to when some of the first stars in the universe formed .         mag at a mean time of 23.8 hours after the burst  @xcite . ]",
    "by locating prompt on cerro tololo near the 4.1-meter diameter soar telescope ( which is less expensive and more convenient than locating prompt on cerro pachon next to soar ) , we ensure that every grb that is observable to prompt is also observable to soar . given soar s rapid response capabilities ",
    "rapid slewing and instrument changing , an interrupt policy that was designed with grbs in mind and spans partner institutions , and remote observing centers  this ensures that a spectroscopic redshift will also be measured for nearly every grb that prompt detects , even if faint or rapidly fading . although we do not plan to use prompt for target selection for soar , prompt will prove useful for deciding which spectrograph to use once soar is in position : if prompt finds a grb to be at high redshift or highly extinguished , we will stick with our default , nir spectrograph ( osiris , resolution = 3,000 ) .",
    "otherwise , we will switch to the optical spectrograph ( unc - chapel hill s goodman spectrograph , resolution = 8,000 ) , a change that we can make in under a minute .",
    "swift s uvot , although unable to distinguish between high - redshift and highly extinguished grbs , will provide similar information , but on a longer timescale .",
    "in addition to using soar to complement prompt s ugrr@xmath3izjh spectral coverage with nir and optical spectroscopy , we will take a few k - band images with soar to extend prompt s redshift range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "this spectral coverage synergizes nicely with swift s uvot s ultraviolet and ubv spectral coverage , not to mention prompt s typically half - minute faster response time .",
