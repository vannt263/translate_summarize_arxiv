    "since its launch in 2008 , the _ kepler _ mission has revealed a population of planets with radii between that of earth and neptune , which make up a substantial fraction of the planets in the galaxy borucki11 , howard12 .",
    "no planet of that size exists in our own solar system as an archetype for these `` super earths . ''",
    "this population likely has a range of compositions from rocky , to water - rich , to gas - rich rogers15,wolfgang14 , but we have not yet probed their compositions directly . a critical part of the puzzle to understand the nature of super earths is to measure the abundances of molecules in their atmospheres .",
    "one powerful tool that has been used to probe the atmospheres of transiting planets is transmission spectroscopy . during a transit , the transit depth",
    "is measured simultaneously at multiple wavelengths . at wavelengths of strong absorption features",
    ", the planet s atmosphere will become optically thick at a higher altitude and we will observe a deeper transit ; at wavelengths outside these absorption features , the planet s atmosphere is optically thinner and the transit depth is shallower .",
    "the depth of the features we observe in a cloud - free atmosphere scales linearly with the pressure scale height @xmath4 seager00 , hubbard01 .",
    "the scale height is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath7 is temperature , @xmath8 is gravity , and @xmath9 is the mean molecular weight . in the absence of clouds , low gravity ,",
    "low density targets have the largest amplitude features and many have been targeted for characterization .    by measuring the amplitude of features in a planet s transmission spectrum",
    "we can both probe the composition of absorbers like sodium , potassium , methane , water , and carbon monoxide and also measure the bulk composition of the atmosphere by measuring the mean molecular weight . if the observed mean molecular weight is low ( @xmath10 ) the planet is h / he - rich like a scaled down neptune ; if it is high , it may be water , nitrogen , or carbon dioxide rich , more akin to a terrestrial planet miller - ricci09 .",
    "hundreds of orbits of hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) time have been dedicated to characterizing these small planets , as well as hundreds of hours of ground - based observations . despite this dedication of resources , super earths and sub - neptunes",
    "have proved extremely challenging to characterize with this technique because their features are more muted than predicted using cloud - free models .    by far the most - studied super earth to date",
    "is gj 1214b , the first planet discovered by the mearth survey charbonneau09 .",
    "gj 1214b is a 6.16 @xmath110.91@xmath12  and 2.71@xmath110.24@xmath13  planet , and , critically , orbits a fairly bright mid m dwarf ( m4.5 ) .",
    "its transit depth of over 1% and a short orbital period of 38 hours make it an ideal target for high signal - to - noise followup observations .",
    "early observations from both ground and space were inconclusive : they showed no features , but were not sensitive enough to detect the small features predicted for a high mean molecular weight atmosphere bean10 , desert11c , crossfield11 , croll11 , berta12 , demooij12 , murgas12 , teske13 , fraine13 . in 2014 , kreidberg14 measured 15 additional transits of gj 1214b with _ hst _ wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) grism spectroscopy ( 1.11.7 @xmath9 m ) and detected , at high signal to noise , a featureless transmission spectrum .",
    "unlike the previous observations , these observations were sensitive enough to detect features in a high mean molecular weight atmosphere .",
    "they concluded that the predicted molecular features are obscured by a high altitude cloud or haze layer .",
    "other planets close to gj 1214b s size have also been observed with this technique , with somewhat lower signal - to - noise than the kreidberg14 observations . knutson14b",
    "present observations of the super earth hd 97658b and show that its spectrum is consistent with a flat line .",
    "likewise , the neptune - sized gj 436b and gj 3470b also have featureless spectra measured with wfc3 within their measurement uncertainties knutson14a , ehrenreich14 .",
    "in fact , the only planet in the super - earth to neptune mass range with a statistically significant spectral feature is hat - p-11b ; water vapor absorption was detected using wfc3 with an amplitude of 250 parts per million fraine14 .",
    "this measurement is consistent with a metal - enhanced h / he dominated atmosphere with a several hundred times solar metallicity composition or a less enriched atmosphere with features muted by clouds or hazes .",
    "the observing efforts to date have revealed that small , cool planets have relatively featureless transmission spectra . if features are muted in the transmission spectra of all small planets , it will be extremely challenging to characterize their compositions using transmission spectroscopy .",
    "while these featureless near - infrared transmission spectra are informative  they inform us that there is an optically thick , gray absorber in the measured wavelength range  they do not allow us to measure the composition of the atmosphere . to understand the compositions of super earths  perhaps the most abundant planets in the galaxy  we need to probe their atmospheres with other techniques .",
    "a number of pathways will help to accomplish this goal , including transmission spectra of hotter targets , thermal emission spectra , and reflected light spectra .    in this paper , we use models of super earths to understand how we can characterize super earths as a class .",
    "we move beyond modeling gj 1214b itself and run models of its cousins , with the same gravity and host star but different incident flux .",
    "cloud and haze formation depends strongly on incident flux ( and resulting equilibrium temperature ) so spanning a range of irradiation levels allows us to make predictions about a diverse set of planets .",
    "we quantify properties of clouds or hazes thick enough to flatten transmission spectra at the signal - to - noise of the kreidberg14 observations for a variety of different incident flux levels .",
    "using these cloud properties , we generate both thermal emission spectra and reflected light spectra . with the upcoming _ jwst _  mission , thermal emission of selected super earths will be observable over a wide wavelength range gardner06 ; we show how optically thick clouds and hazes will shape that thermal emission . in the more distant future ,",
    "missions to detect reflected light from exoplanets using a space - based coronagraph are being planned spergel15 .",
    "we show that reflected light spectra will be a promising technique to understand very cloudy super earths , especially for colder objects .      in section [ methods ] , we describe the extensive set of modeling tools used to model the effects of clouds and hazes on super earth spectra . in section [ eq_clouds ] , transmission , emission , and reflection spectra for planets with equilibrium clouds ( both salt / sulfide in warm planets and water ice in cold planets ) are presented . in section [ phot_hazes ] , transmission , emission , and reflection spectra for planets with photochemical hazes",
    "are presented . in section [ discussion ] , we discuss implications of this work for future studies and in section [ conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "the appendix discusses the new , flexible radiative transfer tool developed for this work .",
    "in order to predict spectra of small planets with clouds and hazes , we use a comprehensive suite of atmosphere modeling tools . we use a 1d radiative  convective model to calculate the pressure  temperature structure , a photochemical model to calculate the formation of soot precursors ( hydrocarbons that may form hazes ) , and a cloud model to calculate cloud altitudes , mixing ratios , and particle sizes .",

    "higher metallicity opacities have not been calculated , so in order to calculate the temperature structures at higher metallicities ( 100 - 1000@xmath0 solar ) , we approximate the gas opacity by multiplying the [ m / h]=1.7 pre - summed opacities by the appropriate factor . for example , for 300@xmath0 solar metallicity , we multiply the 50@xmath0 solar summed molecular gas opacities by 6 .",

    "we can however show that , for our assumed vertical mixing values in the photochemical model ( @xmath19=10@xmath32 cm@xmath14s@xmath28 ) , which are based on upper limits from circulation models ( kataria14 and t. kataria , private communication ) , mixing should be vigorous enough to loft @xmath11  particles .    in figure",

    ". the conditions present in super earths like gj 1214b , including the moderately high temperature ( @xmath1600 k ) and the h@xmath15-rich composition , are quite different from that of any solar system planets or moons , and therefore require new laboratory studies .",
    "lab experiments are crucial because theoretical modeling of full chemical kinetic pathways from 2-carbon hydrocarbons to complex pahs and long - chain hydrocarbons poses a huge challenge .",
    "the information provided by laboratory measurements would provide empirical constrains on these reactions .",
    "for example , we could determine whether reactions necessary to create condensible hydrocarbons do indeed proceed at low pressures in a gj 1214b - like atmosphere , and whether , like on titan s these hydrocarbons form with the help of ion chemistry lavvas11 .",

    "looking to the future , one path that will be opened with the launch of the james webb space telescope ( _ jwst _ ) will be observing the thermal emission spectra of warm and hot super earths .",

    "for longer wavelengths , the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) will be capable of low ( r@xmath1100 ) resolution spectroscopy from 514  and moderate resolution ( r@xmath13000 ) spectroscopy from 528.3 .",

    "given high signal - to - noise observations across a wide wavelength range , it should be possible to determine the differences between these models .",
    "however , piecing together an infrared spectrum will be an expensive endeavor that requires multiple observations , each taking many hours . as a community , targets for this treatment must be carefully considered .    of concern",
    "is that many models with thick clouds ( that match the transmission spectrum observations ) have spectra that appear nearly identical to blackbodies .",
    "if these models indeed represent reality , thermal emission will not allow us to determine the compositions of gases in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "however , the models that include optically thick photochemical hazes in the upper atmosphere have strong temperature inversions that create observable emission bands in the mid - infrared . discovering a spectrum like this would strongly indicate that hazes are indeed the cause of flat transmission spectra ; constraining the strength of the temperature inversion would allow us to constrain the optical properties of the hazes , since this inversion indicates that the particles are strong optical and weaker infrared absorbers .",
