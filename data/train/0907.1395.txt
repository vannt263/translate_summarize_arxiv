    "the study of baryon - baryon systems involving strangeness has the potential of considerably deepening our understanding of strong interaction physics .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental information on such systems is rather limited .",
    "though there is at least a fair amount of _ concrete _ data on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 systems , the empirical information on the strangeness @xmath9 sector is only of qualitative nature .",
    "it consists of limits for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 reaction cross sections @xcite and in the binding energy of @xmath12 @xcite , where the latter implies that the @xmath13 interaction can be only moderately attractive .",
    "virtually nothing is known about the baryon - baryon interaction in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems .",
    "indeed , even theoretical investigations on those systems are rather scarce @xcite . in 1999 , the nijmegen group presented an extension of their meson - exchange hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath14 ; @xmath15 ) potential @xcite to interaction channels with @xmath9 , @xmath16 , and @xmath1 @xcite invoking @xmath2 flavor symmetry arguments . in the actual model calculation ,",
    "@xmath17 symmetry is broken by using the physical values of the involved baryon and meson masses and , in addition , some breaking of the baryon - baryon - meson coupling constants is allowed .",
    "the interactions predicted in this way for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors turned out to be fairly strong and attractive and even suggests the existence of bound states in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels @xcite . such strongly attractive @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryon - baryon interactions have further interesting implications .",
    "for example , filikin and gal argued that then fairly light hypernuclei with @xmath0 should exist @xcite . in particular , @xmath18 could then already mark the onset of nuclear stability for @xmath19 hyperons .",
    "a strong @xmath8 interaction could induce a first order phase transition from neutron matter to hyperon - rich matter @xcite so that , besides ordinary white dwarfs and neutron stars , a new class of compact stars , namely hyperon stars , could exist .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction of fujiwara and collaborators @xcite is derived in the constituent quark model .",
    "it contains the color fermi - breit interaction and effective - meson exchanges ( pseudoscalar , scalar , vector mesons ) between quarks , among others . also here",
    "@xmath17 symmetry plays a key role in extending the model from the @xmath20 and @xmath14 interaction ( where free parameters are fixed ) to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels . and also here",
    "an explicit flavor - symmetry breaking is introduced , namely in the fermi - breit interaction .",
    "but in this approach it was found that the baryon - baryon interaction becomes step by step less attractive when going from strangeness @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , no di - baryon bound states are supported , except for the deuteron .",
    "in this context we present here a first study of the baryon - baryon interaction in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors in the framework of _ chiral effective field theory _ ( eft ) .",
    "outlined by weinberg in the early 1990s @xcite the concepts of chiral eft have been applied very successfully in the last decade to the @xmath20 ( and @xmath23 ) interaction and to the physics of light nuclei , resulting in a high - precision description of the experimental data , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , this framework was utilized by us also for investigating the @xmath14 interactions as well as the baryon - baryon interaction in the @xmath9 sector @xcite . in particular",
    ", we showed that the leading order ( lo ) chiral eft successfully describes the available @xmath14 scattering data @xcite .",
    "also the binding energies of the light hypernuclei are predicted well within chiral eft @xcite .",
    "the extension of our investigations of the baryon - baryon interaction within chiral eft to the strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors is straightforward .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges @xcite . under the assumption of @xmath17 symmetry the interaction for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryon - baryon sector",
    "depends on the same ( five ) contact terms that enter also in the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "thus , we can take over the values which were fixed in our study of the @xmath14 sector by a fit to the pertinent ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) data @xcite .",
    "then the interaction in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels is a genuine prediction that follows from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sect .",
    "ii we provide a short overview of the chiral eft approach with emphasis on its extension to the strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors . in sect .",
    "iii we show results for the coupled @xmath24 system and for the @xmath8 channel . specifically , we present integrated cross sections and effective range parameters for the @xmath25-waves and we compare our results to those of the two potential models mentioned above .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary .",
    "we construct the chiral effective potentials for the strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 sector at lo using the weinberg power counting similar to the @xmath14 case considered in @xcite .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "details on the derivation of the lo contact terms for the octet baryon - baryon interaction can be found in ref .",
    "here we only list the final result for the @xmath26 and @xmath8 partial wave potentials in the singlet and triplet s - waves , cf .",
    "table  [ tab:2.1 ] . also the @xmath21 and @xmath27 potentials are included in table  [ tab:2.1 ] for completeness . for convenience in the present paper",
    "we express the baryon - baryon potentials in terms of the @xmath17 irreducible representations , see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite , so that the contact interaction is given by @xmath28 from the relations in table  [ tab:2.1 ] we can see that for the @xmath29 channel there is a one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 sectors , i.e. the @xmath20 and the @xmath8 interactions , and also between the @xmath3 and @xmath0 sectors , i.e. the @xmath14 and @xmath26 interactions .",
    "thus , if @xmath17 symmetry is fully realized then not only the potentials but even the reaction amplitudes would be the same in the corresponding sectors .",
    "of course , the symmetry is no longer fulfilled once physical values for the baryon masses are used in the evaluation of the scattering observables , even for a @xmath17 symmetric interaction potential .",
    "note that there is no such correspondence for the @xmath30 channel because here the role of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 representations is interchanged when going from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and from @xmath3 to @xmath0 , respectively .",
    ".various lo baryon - baryon contact potentials for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 partial waves in the isospin basis .",
    "these potentials are flavor symmetric .",
    ". refers to the corresponding @xmath17 irreducible representation @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this table reveals the reason for the sizeable @xmath34 cross section predicted by the chiral eft interactions , namely a rather large scattering length in the corresponding @xmath29 partial wave .",
    "it is obvious that its value is strongly sensitive to cut - off variations .",
    "it even changes sign ( in other words , it becomes infinite ) within the considered cut - off range .",
    "this means that a virtual bound state transforms into a real bound state , where the strongest binding occurs for the cut - off @xmath35 mev and leads to a binding energy of @xmath36mev .",
    "while this behaviour is interesting per se , one certainly has to stress that in such a case the predictive power of our lo calculation is rather limited .",
    "one has to wait for at least an nlo calculation , where we expect that the cut - off dependence will become much weaker so that more reliable conclusions on the possible existence of a virtual or a real bound state should be possible .",
    "the @xmath29 scattering lengths of the other potentials suggest also an overall attractive interaction in this partial wave though only a very moderate one .",
    "the results for the @xmath30 state of the @xmath34 channel are fairly similar for all considered interactions . moreover , with regard to the chiral eft interaction there is very little cut - off dependence .",
    "the @xmath25-waves in the @xmath7 @xmath37 channel belong to the same ( @xmath32 and @xmath38 , respectively ) irreducible representations where in the @xmath20 case real ( @xmath39 ) or virtual ( @xmath29 ) bound states exist , cf . table  [ tab:2.1 ] .",
    "therefore , one expects that such states can also occur for @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , bound states are present for both partial waves in the nijmegen model , cf . the discussion in sect .",
    "iii.b in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "their presence is reflected in the positive and fairly large singlet and triplet scattering lengths for @xmath40 , cf .",
    "table  [ tab : r2 ] .",
    "the chiral eft interaction has positive scattering lengths of comparable magnitude for @xmath29 , for all cut - off values , and therefore bound states , too .",
    "these binding energies lie in the range of @xmath41mev ( @xmath42mev ) to @xmath43mev ( 700 mev ) . in the @xmath39 partial wave the attraction is obviously not strong enough to form a bound state .",
    "the same is the case ( but for both @xmath25 waves ) for the quark model fss2 of fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 state of the @xmath8 channel belongs also to the @xmath38plet irreducible representation and also here the nijmegen as well as the chiral eft interactions produce bound states ( see also @xcite ) . in our case",
    "the binding energies lie in the range of @xmath44mev ( @xmath42mev ) to @xmath45mev ( 700 mev ) .",
    "the predictions of both approaches for the @xmath30 scattering length are comparable .",
    "the quark model of fujiwara et al .",
    "exhibits a different behavior for the @xmath8 channel , see the last column in table  [ tab : r2 ] .",
    "the small and negative @xmath29 scattering length signals an interaction that is only moderately attractive .",
    "the large and positive scattering length in the @xmath39 partial wave , produced by that potential model , is usually a sign for the presence of a bound state , though according to the authors this is not the case for this specific interaction .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath46 cross section predicted by the quark model is significantly larger than the results of our chiral eft interaction as well as those of the nijmegen meson - exchange potential , see , table  [ tab : r1 ] .",
    "in this letter we have presented leading - order results for the @xmath26 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath8 interactions obtained within a chiral effective field theory approach based on weinberg s power counting , derived analogous to the @xmath14 potential presented in @xcite , by relating the strangeness @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryon - baryon interactions via @xmath2 flavor symmetry to the one in the @xmath14 system .    the lo chiral potential consists of two pieces : firstly , the longer - ranged one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges and secondly , shorter - ranged four - baryon contact terms without derivatives .",
    "all the occuring five contact terms were already fixed in our study of the @xmath14 interaction so that genuine predictions can be made for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 baryon - baryon interactions based on chiral eft and the assumed @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the reaction amplitude is obtained by solving a regularized coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equation for the lo chiral potential .",
    "we used an exponential regulator function to regularize the potential and applied cut  offs in the range between @xmath48 and @xmath49mev .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether the new facilities j - parc ( tokai , japan ) and fair ( darmstadt , germany ) allow access to empirical information about the interaction in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sector .",
    "such information could come from formation experiments of corresponding hypernuclei or from proton - proton and antiproton - proton collisions at such high energies that pairs of baryons with strangeness @xmath0 or @xmath22 can be produced .",
    "there is also a possibility to find signals for strange di - baryon states in heavy - ion collisions @xcite which likewise would provide information on the corresponding baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the chiral eft developed here could then be used to analyze these upcoming data in a model - independent way .",
    "it would be also interesting to see how these interactions can be tested in multi - strange three - baryon systems recently explored in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank andreas  nogga for comments and a careful reading of our manuscript .",
