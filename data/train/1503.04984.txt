    "this paper studies the transient workload in a queue fed by a lvy input process @xmath1 ; here the workload process , in the sequel denoted by @xmath2 , is defined as the reflection of @xmath3 at zero .",
    "this workload process can be constructed from the input process @xmath3 as the ( unique ) solution of the so - called skorokhod problem , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the process @xmath4 follows from @xmath3 through @xmath5 where @xmath6 the process @xmath7 is often referred to as _ local time ( at zero ) _ or _ regulator process _ @xcite .    as mentioned above , we are interested in the transient behavior of the workload process . in queueing theory transient analysis is a classical topic that is treated in various standard textbooks ; see e.g.  @xcite . typically , transient analysis is important in situations where the time horizon considered is relatively short , so that it can not be ensured that the system is ` close to stationarity ' .",
    "in addition , transient results are useful in cases that the net - input process changes over time ; it for instance facilitates the analysis of systems with time - varying demand as well as the assessment of the impact of specific workload control mechanisms . in general ,",
    "transient analysis allows us to assess the impact of the initial state @xmath8 .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the generalization of the existing results on the transient behavior of the workload process @xmath2 .",
    "we consider @xmath9 exponentially distributed random variables @xmath10 with parameters @xmath11 and we analyze the joint behavior of the vector @xmath12 with a specific focus on @xmath13 .",
    "it is noted that this also directly yields @xmath14 when @xmath15 follows a _",
    "coxian _ distribution ; see section  [ sec : concl ] for some additional background on this claim .",
    "this observation is particularly useful owing to the fact that any distribution on the positive half line can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a sequence of coxian distributions ( in the sense of convergence ; see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section iii.4 ) ) . for the case of a spectrally positive input process",
    ", the results are given in terms of the laplace - stieltjes transform ( lst ) , whereas we find an expression for the associated density for the spectrally negative case .",
    "apart from the general results obtained , a second contribution lies in the reasoning behind our proofs .",
    "more specifically , our proofs reveal that the above formulas obey an elegant and simple tree structure .",
    "the transient workload behavior consists of @xmath16 terms that can be recursively evaluated .",
    "we prove our results by induction ; given that we know the expression for the quantity under consideration at @xmath17 exponential epochs , we derive the expression at @xmath9 exponential epochs . in this induction step , from @xmath17 to @xmath9 that is , it can be seen how each term produces two offsprings , thus giving insight into the underlying structure .",
    "the idea behind the proofs yields a _ mechanism _ to address questions related to transient analysis at random epochs , which may help in obtaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of the underlying continuous - time queueing system .    transient analysis of queueing systems started with the analysis of the waiting times in the m / m/1 queue @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyze the laplace - stieltjes transform of the waiting time process in the m / g/1 queue . the argument used there is also applied in @xcite , so as to derive theorem [ spectrally positive one ] below for the case of a compound poisson input process .",
    "the transient analysis of lvy driven queues is of a much more recent date ; see e.g.  @xcite for results on the workload process in a lvy - driven queue at an exponential epoch ( which are briefly summarized in section  [ sec : pre ] ) . as a direct application",
    "the authors of @xcite study clearing models , where special attention is paid to clearings at exponential epochs ( relying on results on the workload at an exponential epoch in an m / g/1 setting ) .    concerning the structure of the paper , in section 2 we present our notation , as well as the preliminaries that are needed in order to prove our results . in section 3 we present the main results of the paper , which are thms .  [ maintheorem ] and [ spectrally negative general case density ] .",
    "we support the final results with intuitive arguments based on a tree structure ; the proofs can also be interpreted along those lines . in section 4 we present results obtained in numerical experiments .",
    "section 5 contains the proofs of thms .",
    "[ maintheorem ] and [ spectrally negative general case density ] . in all sections ,",
    "the spectrally positive and spectrally negative cases are treated separately .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] contains conclusions and a brief discussion .",
    "in this section we present the workload at an exponential epoch for queues with spectrally positive ( section  [ subs : pre - pos ] ) and spectrally negative ( section  [ subs : pre - neg ] ) lvy input processes .",
    "these results are heavily relied upon throughout the paper , and in addition serve as a benchmark . in passing ,",
