    "the exponential - type manning - rosen ( mr ) potential @xcite , given by , @xmath1 , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\kappa=\\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2},\\ ] ] is used as an important mathematical model for molecular vibrations and rotations @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath2 and the strength parameter @xmath3 are two dimensionless parameters , while the screening parameter @xmath4 , having a dimension of length , is related to the range of potential .",
    "this has found considerable applications in several bound - state and scattering problems in physics .",
    "it is obvious that the potential remains invariant under the transformation @xmath5 . for @xmath6 or 1 ,",
    "this equation reduces to the familiar short - range hulthn potential @xcite having useful applications in nuclear , particle , solid - state and chemical physics .",
    "there is a relative minimum value , @xmath7 at @xmath8,$ ] for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this potential has received significant attention in recent years .",
    "it is well - known that the schrdinger equation for @xmath11 states ( @xmath12 ) of this potential can be solved _",
    "exactly_. such bound states are obtained analytically by a number of attractive routes ; _ viz .",
    ", _ a direct factorization method @xcite , feynman path - integral formalism @xcite , where eigenenergies , eigenfunctions are extracted from poles , residues of green s function respectively , a standard function analysis method expressing solutions in terms of generalized hyper - geometric functions @xcite , a tridiagonal matrix representation of wave operator in a complete square integrable basis @xcite , etc .",
    "_ exact _ solutions of @xmath11-wave scattering states also are obtained from standard method @xcite .",
    "however , the non - zero angular momentum states can not be obtained _ exactly _ analytically in closed form .",
    "therefore , several approximation schemes have been proposed for these with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency .",
    "the first definitive results for arbitrary @xmath13 states were presented by invoking an approximation of @xmath14 for the centrifugal term in short range @xcite , quite similar in spirit to the familiar pekeris approximation .",
    "some of the other notable approaches are : a super - symmetric shape invariance formalism in conjunction with function analysis method @xcite , an approximation for centrifugal term different from the usual one used above , containing 3 adjustable parameters in it @xcite , yet another alternative approximation to the centrifugal potential within a nikiforov - uvarov method @xcite , the duru - kleinert method of path - integral formalism @xcite , laguerre and oscillator bases to tridiagonalize the reference hamiltonian and subsequently a gauss quadrature approach for estimation of potential matrix elements @xcite , a j - matrix method @xcite , etc .",
    "approximate analytical scattering - state solutions of @xmath13-wave schrdinger equation have been presented in @xcite by a proper approximation of the centrifugal term , as well as by the j - matrix method @xcite .",
    "some other methods have also been presented @xcite .",
    "a purely numerical integrating procedure has also been programmed @xcite as well for bound states , invoking the mathematica package , which offers decent results , especially in the short potential range , i.e. , small @xmath13 and @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method has been shown to be quite successful for a number of physical situations , including the spiked harmonic oscillator , hulthn , yukawa , logarithmic , power - law , hellmann , exponential - screened coulomb potentials , etc .",
    ", as well as lower and higher states ( including rydberg states ) in atoms and molecules ( see the references @xcite and therein ) . very accurate ,",
    "reliable results were obtained through a _",
    "non - uniform , optimal _ spatial discretization in all these cases . in the present communication ,",
    "our interest is to study the ro - vibrational spectra of mr potential through this gps method , in order to assess its validity and performance in the current context .",
    "that will help extend the domain of applicability of the method to a broader range of physical systems .",
    "one interesting aspect of this potential is that there is a value of screening parameter , denoted by @xmath15 , the _",
    "critical screening parameter _ , beyond which the state @xmath16 ceases to be a bound state .",
    "so far , only in one of the references @xcite , some attention has been paid on this important issue ; here we put particular emphasis to the eigenspectrum _ close to such threshold regions_. moreover , excellent quality results are available for low - lying states , while only very few studies have been devoted to _ high - lying states_. we find interesting complex level crossing in higher @xmath17 states more predominantly than in lower states , in regions close to zero energy , which has remained hitherto unobserved . a thorough analysis on variation of energies with respect to screening parameter and @xmath2",
    "are presented . to this end , accurate ro - vibrational energies and wave functions of _ all _",
    "the 55 levels corresponding to @xmath0 states of mr potential are reported .",
    "screening parameters of arbitrary field strengths ( covering both weak and strong limits of interaction ) have been considered for particular values of vibrational and rotational quantum number . for further understanding , radial probability densities , expectation values are also reported for some selected states .",
    "a detailed comparison with literature results has been made wherever possible .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief summary of the gps method .",
    "a discussion of our results is given in section iii , while section iv makes a few concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , an overview of the employed methodology is presented .",
    "more details could be found in the references @xcite and therein .",
    "for the purpose of maintaining consistency with literature , we choose @xmath18 .",
    "atomic units employed throughout the article , unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "we are interested in the solution of radial schrdinger equation , which can be written in following operator form , @xmath19 the hamiltonian operator includes usual kinetic and potential energy terms , @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the mr potential , as given in eq .  ( 1 ) .",
    "the symbols have their usual significances .",
    "majority of the finite - difference discretization schemes for solution of radial schrdinger equation arising in these situations often require very large number of spatial grid points , mainly due to their uniform distributional nature .",
    "gps method , on the other hand , facilitates a nonuniform , optimal discretization , maintaining similar kind of accuracies at both small as well as large @xmath23 regions .",
    "therefore , one has the advantage of working with a much lesser grid points compared to many other methods in the literature .",
    "thus we can have a denser mesh at smaller @xmath23 while a coarser mesh at large @xmath23 .",
    "the principal feature of this scheme is that a function @xmath24 defined in an interval @xmath25,$ ] can be approximated by a polynomial @xmath26 of order n of the following form , @xmath27 at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath28 , above approximation is _ exact _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath29 in the legendre pseudospectral method used in this study , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , while the @xmath32 are obtained from roots of first derivative of legendre polynomial @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 the cardinal functions @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) are given by the following expression , @xmath37 satisfying a unique property that @xmath38 .",
    "now the semi - infinite domain @xmath39 $ ] is mapped onto a finite domain @xmath25 $ ] by a transformation of the form @xmath40 .",
    "next , one could use the following algebraic nonlinear mapping , @xmath41 with l and @xmath42 being the two mapping parameters , as well a transformation of the form , @xmath43 .",
    "this , coupled with a symmetrization procedure , subsequently leads to a transformed hamiltonian as below , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is given by the following relation , @xmath46 the advantage is that this leads to a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to produce accurate eigenvalues , eigenfunctions at the same time using standard available routines , quite easily and efficiently .",
    "this discretization then finally leads to a set of coupled equations as below ,    @xmath47 a_j = ea_{j'},\\ \\ \\ \\ j=1,\\ldots , n-1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath48^{1/2 } \\psi(r(x_j))\\ \\left [ p_n(x_j)\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] and @xmath49 is the symmetrized second derivative of cardinal function . for their expressions and other details ,",
    "please see the references @xcite and therein .    in order to make a judicious choice of mapping parameters",
    ", a large number of tests were carried out to check the performance of this scheme .",
    "a sufficiently large range of potential parameters were scanned for this purpose to gain confidence .",
    "all our results are reported only up to the precision that were found to maintain stability with respect to these variations . in this way ,",
    "a consistent set of numerical parameters ( @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) has been chosen which seemed to be appropriate and satisfactory for the current problem . for higher excited states and also near the critical screening region , @xmath53 was increased , for obvious reasons .",
    "these are mentioned in appropriate places in the text .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] estimated critical screening parameters , @xmath15 , of mr potential , for @xmath54 . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     as a further test of the quality and convergence of our eigenfunctions , four calculated density moments , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , of mr potential are reported for 2p , 3p , 4p , 3d states ; all having @xmath59 and corresponding to @xmath54 ( left panel ) and 1.5 ( right panel ) .",
    "these have not been reported before except for some @xmath56 and @xmath57 , for @xmath54 , in j - matrix study of @xcite , which are duly quoted for comparison .",
    "the general agreement seems to be quite satisfactory .",
    "however , some minor discrepancies are noticed , especially for @xmath57 ; which could be due to the differences in wave functions obtained from these two methods .",
    "a detailed study has been carried out on the _ accurate _ eigenvalues , eigenfunctions , density moments and radial densities of mr potential by means of gps formalism .",
    "this is a simple , quite easy to implement , accurate and reliable method . _",
    "all _ the 55 eigenstates belonging to @xmath0 have been presented with excellent accuracy .",
    "results are compared wherever possible . a detailed estimate of the _ critical screening _",
    "parameter is provided and compared .",
    "a thorough analysis is made to examine the _ effect of screening _ by scanning through weak , intermediate and very stronger regions .",
    "special emphasis has been given to _",
    "stronger _ couplings as there is a visible scarcity in the literature .",
    "considerable attention was also paid for _ high - lying states _",
    ", as reference values are quite scanty for these states .",
    "as demonstrated , present results are _ significantly improved _ from the best reference results available so far .",
    "new _ states are reported here for the first time . in view of the simplicity and accuracy offered by this method for the system under investigation",
    ", it is hoped that this may be equally useful and successful for other molecular potentials , some of which may be taken up in later communications .",
