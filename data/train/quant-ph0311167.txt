    "quantum fluctuations of light play an important role in the sensitivity limits of optical measurements such as interferometric measurements considered for gravitational - wave detection @xcite .",
    "a gravitational wave induces a differential variation of the optical pathes in the two arms of a michelson interferometer .",
    "the detection of the phase difference between the two optical pathes is ultimately limited by the quantum noises of light : the phase fluctuations of the incident laser beam introduce noise in the measurement whereas radiation pressure of light induces unwanted mirrors displacements . due to the heisenberg s inequality ,",
    "both noises are conjugate and lead to the so - called standard quantum limit for the sensitivity of the measurement when coherent states of light are used @xcite .",
    "potential applications of squeezed states to overcome this limit have motivated a large number of works in quantum optics .",

    "another possibility is to take advantage of the quantum effects of radiation pressure in the interferometer to perform a quantum nondemolition measurement @xcite . since radiation pressure effects are frequency dependent , a main issue is to find simple schemes which improve the sensitivity over a wide frequency band @xcite .",
    "another issue is to precisely examine the constraints imposed to the interferometer by the use of such quantum techniques .",
    "losses in particular may have drastic effects on the sensitivity improvement .",
    "an alternative approach consists in using feedback mechanisms working in the quantum regime .",
    "this technique has been proposed to generate squeezed states @xcite or to perform quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite , and experimentally demonstrated on laser oscillators @xcite and twin beams @xcite .",
    "active controls are also widely used in the classical regime as for example in cold - damped mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "cold damping is able to reduce the mechanical thermal displacements of a mirror @xcite , and it may in principle be used to reduce the displacement noises in a quantum regime , down to the zero - point quantum fluctuations of the mirror @xcite .",
    "we discuss in this paper the possibility to increase the sensitivity in interferometers by reducing radiation pressure effects with such a feedback mechanism .",
    "we propose to use a compact optomechanical sensor made of a high - finesse cavity to measure the mirror displacements induced by radiation pressure .",
    "the information is fed back to the mirror in order to lock its position at the quantum level .",
    "we show that the sensor sensitivity is transferred to the interferometric measurement , resulting in a reduction of the back - action noise associated with the radiation pressure in the interferometer @xcite .",
    "we present in section [ sec_quantumlimits ] the main characteristics of the quantum noises in an interferometric measurement .",
    "section [ sec_quantumlocking ] is devoted to the active control of a mirror and to the resulting reduction of back - action noise in the interferometer . as shown in section [ sec_backaction ] , it is possible to completely suppress back - action noise if the optomechanical sensor performs a quantum nondemolition measurement of the mirror motion @xcite .",
    "we finally study in section [ sec_cavitylocking ] the control of the whole fabry - perot cavity in each interferometer arms with a single optomechanical sensor .",

    "a gravitational wave induces a length variation of the cavities and is detected as a change in the interference fringes at the output of the interferometer .",
    "as long as we are concerned with quantum and mirror - induced noises , the interferometer is equivalent to a simpler scheme consisting in a single resonant optical cavity , as shown in figure [ fig_cavity ] , which actually corresponds to one interferometer arm .",

    "one thus expects to be able to detect length variations small compared to the optical wavelength @xmath15 by using large values of the optomechanical parameter @xmath13 , that is for a high - finesse cavity and an intense incident beam .",
    "mirror displacements also limit the sensitivity of the measurement . in the following we focus on the displacements of a single mirror of the cavity , namely , the end mirror @xmath19 in figure [ fig_cavity ] .",
    "the cavity length variation @xmath12 in ( [ equ_phase ] ) is then the sum of the signal @xmath20 and the displacement @xmath21 of mirror @xmath19 , which corresponds to the back - action noise due to radiation pressure , and to classical noises such as seismic or thermal fluctuations .",

    "one has also to take into account the radiation pressures from both cavities , so that the motions of mirrors @xmath19 and @xmath41 are given by , @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the classical noise of mirror @xmath41 and @xmath50 is the transfer function of the feedback loop .",
    "the resulting motion of mirror @xmath19 is obtained from equations ( [ equ_xmest ] ) and ( [ equ_zmvm2 ] ) , @xmath51 the control changes the response of mirror @xmath19 by adding a feedback - induced impedance @xmath52 to the mechanical impedance @xmath23 . for a large feedback gain ,",
    "the effective impedance is increased and the mirror displacements are reduced .",
    "the control also contaminates the mirror motion by the noises in the control cavity [ last terms in ( [ equ_vmfb ] ) ] .",

    "as the feedback gain increases , the classical force @xmath25 applied on mirror @xmath19 is replaced by the force @xmath49 acting on mirror @xmath41 , which can be less noisy if the reference mirror is less coupled to its environment . from the expression ( [ equ_ssig ] ) of the equivalent input noise @xmath55 , the classical noise in the interferometric measurement is reduced down to the displacement noise of mirror @xmath41 . in other words",
    ", the control locks the motion of mirror @xmath19 to the one of the reference mirror @xmath41 , leading to a transfer of noise from the sensor measurement to the interferometric one .",

    "only the last term in ( [ equ_vmfb ] ) is significant , and one gets @xmath57 the motion of mirror @xmath19 no longer depends on the radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement .",
    "apart from the phase noise of beam @xmath42 , the mirror @xmath19 is locked at the quantum level on the reference mirror @xmath41 . its displacement noise reproduces the quantum noises in the sensor measurement , and the resulting sensitivity for the interferometric measurement , deduced from ( [ equ_ssig ] ) and ( [ equ_zrvr ] ) , is given by @xmath58 the two last terms in this equation correspond to the equivalent input noise for the sensor measurement [ compare to equation ( [ equ_ssigfree ] ) with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath60 , and @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",

    "we show in this section that a single control mechanism can lock the cavity at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "taking into account the motion of mirror @xmath79 , the estimator of the interferometric measurement now depends on the differential motion between mirrors @xmath19 and @xmath79 , and equation ( [ equ_xsig ] ) is modified to @xmath80    as shown in figure [ fig_scheme2 ] , the principle of the locking is to use the information provided by the sensor measurement to apply a feedforward force to the input mirror @xmath79 , in such a way that its motion follows the one of mirror @xmath19 .",
    "the key point is that the sensor gives access to the differential motion @xmath81 between mirrors @xmath19 and @xmath79 , for an appropriate choice of the detected quadrature .",

    "the motions of the three mirrors are not independent and one gets , @xmath83 in the case of identical and suspended mirrors , the sum of the three displacements cancels out .",
    "we then detect a quadrature @xmath70 at the output of the sensor cavity with an angle @xmath37 defined by @xmath84 as in the previous section , this quadrature is obtained by sending the field @xmath85 in a properly detuned cavity @xcite . according to ( [ equ_xmest2 ] ) ,",
    "the estimator of the sensor measurement is given by @xmath86 where we have used the relation @xmath87 .",

    "radiation - pressure effects are completely suppressed .",
    "although this quantum locking is not a local control as in the previous sections , an important feature is that it is still insensitive to losses in the interferometer . as a matter of fact",
    ", we have made no assumption on the radiation pressure in the interferometer , except that both mirrors @xmath79 and @xmath19 are submitted to the same force [ equations ( [ equ_zmvm2 ] ) and ( [ equ_zivi ] ) ] .",
    "losses in a gravitational - wave interferometer are mainly due to imperfections on the mirrors , but the propagation between the two mirrors usually is lossless .",
    "radiation pressures exerted on each mirror are the sum of the radiation pressures of the incoming and outgoing fields , and they are the same on both mirrors whatever the mirror losses are .",
    "relation ( [ equ_xixmxr ] ) and the principle of the quantum locking are then valid even in presence of losses in the interferometer .",
    "the active control studied in this paper is based on a local optomechanical sensor which measures the position fluctuations of the mirror and locks its position with respect to a reference mirror .",
    "the main characteristic of the sensor is its sensitivity , defined by an optomechanical parameter @xmath60 which depends on the cavity finesse and the light power .",
    "quantum locking is efficient when the optomechanical parameter of the sensor is of the same order as the one of the interferometer .",

    "taking for example the parameters of the virgo interferometer ( @xmath96 @xmath97 light power in each fabry - perot arms with a global finesse of @xmath98 @xcite ) , this condition corresponds to a sensor of finesse @xmath99 with an intracavity light power of @xmath100 @xmath101 , that is an incident light power of @xmath102 @xmath103 only .",
    "due to the high finesse of the cavity , the same sensitivity is reached for the sensor than for the interferometer itself , while the intracavity and incident light powers are much smaller .",
    "this technique is useful to reduce classical noise such as thermal fluctuations , as long as the reference mirror of the sensor cavity is less noisy than the mirror of the interferometer .",
    "this has already been experimentally demonstrated for the thermal noise of internal acoustic modes of a mirror @xcite . in this case ,",
    "only the cooled mirror is resonant at frequency of interest and thermal noise reduction as large as 1000 have been obtained @xcite",
    ". this technique may be of some help for cryogenic gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "a major issue is the heat generation due to the absorption of the high - power light in the interferometer , which prevents from cooling to very low temperatures @xcite .",
    "since the light in the sensor is much less intense , a low temperature can be reached for the reference mirror by passive cryogenic cooling , and transferred to the interferometer mirror by active control .",
    "concerning the internal thermal noise of mirrors , however , the sensor cavity must detect the noise as it is seen by the interferometric measurement .",
    "the optical waist in the sensor cavity must be adapted to the one in the interferometer , requiring to develop high - finesse cavities with large effective waists @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a local control of mirrors allows one to efficiently reduce the quantum effects of radiation pressure in an interferometric measurement .",
    "the back - action noise is completely suppressed by using an optimized detection strategy .",
    "the sensitivity is thus greatly improved in the low - frequency domain where radiation - pressure effects are dominant , without alteration in the high - frequency domain where phase noise prevails .    in a practical implementation ,",
    "the complete control of a gravitational - wave interferometer would require the use of optomechanical sensors for each sensitive mirrors , that is the four mirrors of the fabry - perot cavities in the interferometer arms .",
    "we have shown that a single control mechanism can lock the whole cavity at the quantum level .",
    "adjusting the detected quadrature , an optomechanical sensor placed near the end mirror of the cavity can monitor the cavity length variations induced by radiation pressure .",
    "the information is then fed back to the front mirror in order to suppress radiation - pressure effects in the interferometric measurement .",

    "the optomechanical sensor detects the radiation - pressure effects in the interferometer , and the information is numerically subtracted from the result of the interferometric measurement .",
