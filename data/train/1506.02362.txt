    "we reduced this equation into an ode @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a polynomial function of degree four .",
    "we analyzed all possible cases about the zeros of @xmath11 . due to this analysis we determined the cases when the solution is periodic or solitary . when the polynomial has one double @xmath12 and two simple zeros @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 , or one triple and one simple zeros , the solution is solitary .",
    "other cases give periodic or non - real solutions . by using the jacobi elliptic functions",
    "@xcite , we obtained periodic solutions and all solitary wave solutions which rapidly decay to some constants , explicitly .",
    "we have also shown that there are no real asymptotically vanishing traveling wave solutions for @xmath9 .",
    "indeed we have the following theorem for the degenerate coupled @xmath0-kdv equation , @xmath16 .",
    "the degenerate coupled @xmath0-kdv equation can be reduced to the equation @xmath17 by taking @xmath0 functions as @xmath18 , @xmath19 ,  , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in ( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
