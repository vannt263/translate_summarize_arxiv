    "the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) surveys of the rosat wide field camera ( wfc , pounds et al . 1993 ) and the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve , bowyer et al .",
    "1994 ) have found a substantial number of white dwarfs , in excess of 120 .",
    "most of these stars are isolated , but over 30 are now known to lie in binary systems ( burleigh 1997 ) . in particular ,",
    "nearly 20 unresolved pairs consisting of a hot white dwarf and a bright , normal star ( spectral type k or earlier ) have been found ( e.g. barstow et al .",
    "1994 , vennes et al .",
    "1995 , burleigh et al .",
    "1997 , burleigh 1998 ) .",
    "prior to the two euv surveys , these systems were all but unidentifiable , since the normal stellar companion completely swamps the optical flux coming from the white dwarf . in each case",
    ", however , the detection of euv radiation with the spectral signature of a hot white dwarf gave a clue to the existence of the previously invisible , faint degenerate companion .",
    "far - ultraviolet spectra taken with the international ultraviolet explorer satellite ( iue ) were then used to confirm the identifications .",
    "this technique has proved excellent for finding these systems in all cases where the normal star is of spectral type @xmath5a5 or later .",
    "in fact , the earliest type star so far identified by this method to have an unresolved hot white dwarf companion is beta crateris ( a2iv@xmath0wd , fleming et al .",
    "indeed , it took a very careful , detailed , analysis by barstow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to finally confirm this discovery . unfortunately , even at far - uv wavelengths , stars of spectral types early a , b or o will still completely dominate any emission from smaller , fainter companions , rendering them invisible even to iue or hst .",
    "overall , the earliest type star known with a white dwarf companion remains sirius ( a1v@xmath0da ) .",
    "the spectral type of the normal star in these binaries gives a lower limit to the mass of the white dwarf progenitor .",
    "the value of the maximum mass feasible for producing a white dwarf , and the form of the initial - final mass relationship ( imfr ) , are long - standing astrophysical problems ( e.g. weidemann 1977 ) .",
    "weidemann ( 1987 ) gives the upper limit as 8m@xmath2 in his semi - empirical ifmr .",
    "recent observations of four white dwarfs in the young open cluster ngc 2516 ( jeffries 1997 ) , however , imply that the upper mass limit for white dwarf progenitors is only 5@xmath66m@xmath2 .",
    "this value is actually in agreement with current stellar evolutionary models which include moderate core overshoot , but , clearly , any observations which can place limits on the maximium white dwarf progenitor mass have important implications for our theories and models of stellar evolution , the birth rate of neutron stars and the predicted rates of type ii galactic supernovae .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     firstly , we assume that the white dwarf has a pure - hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption to make , since barstow et al .",
    "( 1993 ) first showed that for @xmath7@xmath840,000k hot white dwarfs have essentially pure - h atmospheres .",
    "we can then fit a range of models , each fixed at a value of the surface gravity log @xmath9 . before we can do this , however , we need to know the normalisation parameter of each model , which is equivalent to ( radius@xmath10/distance)@xmath11",
    ". we can use the _ hipparcos _ parallax ( 5.86@xmath12 milli - arcsecs .",
    ", esa 1997 ) to calculate the distance to the system ( 170@xmath13 parsecs ) , and the hamada - salpeter zero - temperature mass - radius relation to give us the radius of the white dwarf corresponding to each value of the surface gravity , since we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the star s temperature ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we can also reduce the number of unknown free parameters in the ism model . from euve",
    "spectroscopy , barstow et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measured the line - of - sight interstellar column densities of hi , hei and heii to a number of hot white dwarfs .",
    "they found that the mean h ionisation fraction in the local ism was 0.35@xmath140.1 , and the mean he ionisation fraction was 0.27@xmath140.04 . from these estimates , and assuming a cosmic h / he abundance , we calculate the ratio @xmath15/@xmath16 in the local ism@xmath178.9 , and @xmath16/@xmath18@xmath172.7 .",
    "we can then fix these column density ratios in our model , leaving us with just two free parameters - temperature and the hi column density .",
    "the model fits at a range of surface gravities from log @xmath197.5@xmath69.0 are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we have discovered an unresolved hot white dwarf companion to the 5th magnitude b star hr2875 ( y pup ) .",
    "this is the first time a hot white dwarf @xmath0 b star binary has been detected , and it has important implications for our understanding of white dwarf and stellar evolution , since a white dwarf companion to such an early - type star must have evolved from a very massive progenitor , close to the upper limit for white dwarf formation . according to lang ( 1992 ) a b5v star has a mass of 5.9m@xmath2 ( or 6.5m@xmath2 according to allen , 1973 ) , and if the spectral type is as early as b3v ( as classified in the michigan catalog of hd stars , houk 1982 ) then it will of course have a slightly higher mass .",
    "this is @xmath15@xmath66m@xmath2 upper mass limit for white dwarf progenitors of jeffries ( 1997 ) , but still significantly less than the 8m@xmath2 upper limit from weidemann ( 1987 ) .",
    "since it must have evolved from such a massive progenitor , it is likely that this white dwarf also has a higher mass than the mean for these degenerates ( 0.583@xmath140.078m@xmath2 , marsh et al .",
    "we can use the theoretical initial - final mass relation between main sequence stars and white dwarfs of wood ( 1992 ) , to calculate the mass of the white dwarf if its progenitor was only slightly more massive than hr2875 :    @xmath20@xmath17aexp(b@xmath21@xmath22 )    where  a@xmath170.49462m@xmath2 and b@xmath170.09468m@xmath2@xmath23 . for @xmath22@xmath176.5m@xmath2 ,",
    "we find @xmath20@xmath170.91m@xmath2 .",
    "this would suggest the surface gravity of the white dwarf log @xmath9@xmath248.5 . in the log @xmath198.5 model , @xmath2543,400k and",
    "the white dwarf has a v magnitude @xmath1716.4 ( calculated from the model flux at 5500 ) .",
    "hr2875 is not known to display radial velocity variations , and _ hipparcos _ found no evidence for micro - variations in its proper motion across the sky to suggest that this might be a relatively short period binary system ( p@xmath8few years , esa 1997 ) .",
    "however , it is clearly important to study this system further , and if radial velocity variations are detected then the binary parameters and the white dwarf s mass can be constrained , with important implications for our knowledge of the initial - final mass relation .",
    "additionally , further study of the b star primary might reveal evidence for past interaction .",
    "could the over - abundance of si detected in this object by hiltner et al .",
    "( 1969 ) be due to accretion from the wind of the evolved giant progenitor to the white dwarf , as in the wd@xmath0k2v binary re j0357@xmath028 ( jeffries , burleigh and robb 1996 ) ?",
    "are there more early - type star@xmath0hot white dwarf binaries in the rosat and euve catalogues awaiting discovery ? from its rosat wfc euv and pspc soft x - ray count rates and colours ( s1@xmath1752@xmath147 counts / ksec , s2@xmath17148@xmath1412 counts / ksec , pspc@xmath17124@xmath1424 counts / ksec - all in the lower band ) , we strongly suspect that the 4th magnitude star @xmath4 hya ( b9.5v , @xmath17hr3665 , @xmath17re j0914@xmath002 ) also hides a hot white dwarf companion , and indeed euve is scheduled to observe this star spectroscopically in march 1998 .",
    "other b stars detected in the euv surveys may also have non - interacting degenerate companions , e.g.  ads10129c ( b9.5v , @xmath17hd150100 , @xmath17re j1636@xmath052 ) which also has euv and soft x - ray count rates very similar to known hot white dwarfs ( rosat wfc s1@xmath1712@xmath144 counts / ksec , s2@xmath1746@xmath1411 counts / ksec , pspc@xmath1772@xmath1415 counts / ksec - again , all in the lower band ) .",
    "unfortunately these objects are probably too faint to be detected by the euve spectrometers .",
    "matt burleigh and martin barstow acknowledge the support of pparc , uk .",
    "we thank detlev koester ( kiel ) for the use of his white dwarf model atmosphere grids .    _ note added in proof _",
