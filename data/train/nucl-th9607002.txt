    "the suggestion that the barrier distributions in subbarrier fusion reactions could be determined directly from the cross section data @xcite has led to a renewed experimental activity in the field @xcite . since barrier distributions are proportional to @xmath0 , very accurate measurements of excitation functions at closely - spaced energies",
    "are required .",
    "even with excellent data , smooth barrier distributions can only be obtained under certain model dependent assumptions @xcite",

    "recently , it has been suggested that analyses using integrals over fusion data @xcite provide model independent results , so these should be preferred over analyses that rely on differentiation of data .",

    "we review the relation between cross section and average angular momentum and introduce an expression for calculating the effective barrier radius .",
    "we derive improved relations in section [ sec - ldep ] by using a better approximation for the transmission probability for the @xmath4-th partial wave .",
    "this provides a satisfactory description of the relation between the cross section and average angular momentum for a spherical target . in section [ sec - def ] , we present a qualitative discussion of deformation effects and propose a a simple way to include it in the effective radius . as a practical application of the method , we obtain the average angular momentum from the fusion cross section data in the @xmath5o+@xmath6sm system and compare the results with the experiment .",

    "( [ lint ] ) , it is important to note that , in order to obtain the detailed features of the average angular momentum reliably , the cross section should be interpolated rather than fit globally .",

    "the sharp increase in radius below the barrier with increasing deformation is obviously due to selective sampling of the longer nuclear axis .",

    "comparison of this method with numerical calculations shows that it predicts the average angular momentum from the fusion data reliably , and hence it can be used as a consistency check in cases where quality data are available for both quantities .",

    "( [ a2 ] ) with respect to @xmath46 to obtain another useful identity @xcite , @xmath150    the last two equations can be used to check the consistency of an expansion of the form @xmath151 where @xmath152 are independent of the energy . substituting the relationship between the derivatives , @xmath153 into eqs .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) , we find that the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) is consistent if @xmath154 the right hand side of this equation has a slight dependence on energy ( through the energy - dependence of the turning points ) whereas the left hand side is independent of energy in our approximation .",

    "however , for the @xmath5o @xmath157sm system , even at 7 mev below the barrier ( lower than the fusion cross section has yet been measured ) the error in this approximation is less than 4 % for the bare potential used in ref .",

    "it should be noted that although @xmath46 is not a small parameter , there is a natural cutoff @xmath160 in this parameter given by the condition @xmath161 for values of @xmath46 greater than this , fusion will not occur . due to this cutoff , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ tlcor ] ) will always be larger than the third term .",
