    "next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) effects in electroweak interactions play a crucial role in tests of the standard model , and require careful theoretical evaluation . an excellent place to search for new physics , the deviation of the weak charge of the nucleon from its standard model prediction also requires considerable experimental and theoretical input .",
    "the importance of theoretical predictions for the weak charge of the nucleon was recognized more that two decades ago by marciano and sirlin @xcite .",
    "their original analysis was followed recently by significant theoretical work on the proton weak charge @xcite , which presented an updated standard model prediction for the weak charge of the proton , and estimated the qcd structure uncertainties .",
    "computer packages such as _ feynarts _ @xcite , _ formcalc _",
    "@xcite , _ looptools _ @xcite , @xcite and _ form _ @xcite have created the possibility to go one step further .",
    "now , we have an option of calculating parity - violating nlo effects including all of the possible loop contributions within a given model .",
    "we have already tested the automated approach to calculate one - quark radiative corrections @xcite .    in the work presented here ,",
    "we adopt _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ for the nlo symbolic calculations of amplitude or differential cross section in electron - nucleon scattering . using dirac and pauli - type couplings with the monopole form factor approximation",
    ", we construct the computational model enabling _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ to deal with electron - nucleon scattering up to the nlo level .",
    "since the weak charge of the nucleon is directly related to the form factors of the parity - violating part of the amplitude at the zero momentum transfer , we choose the calculation of the weak charge of the nucleon to be a suitable test our method . within the uncertainty , which mostly comes from the uncertainty of the current electromagnetic form factor measurements , our results agree with experiment .",
    "we start with expressions for pauli and dirac couplings in terms of fermion weak and electric charges , and the definition and classification of one - loop radiative corrections .",
    "after that , an example for the @xmath0 box type of correction for electron - proton scattering is considered and a computational model is proposed .",
    "we proceed with computational details for the self - energy graphs and vertex correction graphs .",
    "since we reserve full kinematic dependence in all types of our nlo calculations , it will make it easier to adopt our results to the current and future parity - violating experiments .",
    "in the approximation where the nucleon behaves as a point - like particle , vector boson couplings obey general rules of electroweak theory . for left and right handed fermions , we can use the following structure for the @xmath1 type couplings : @xmath2,\\label{e1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are chirality projectors and @xmath4 represents the coupling strength for the left and right handed fermions , respectively .",

    "when a photon couples to the nucleon , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "to accommodate nucleon structure , we have the couplings preserve their vector and vector - axial structure , but with the charges replaced by the corresponding form factors .",

    "for @xmath29 we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an axial form factor . to considerably simplify analytical expressions ,",
    "in our computational model we use the monopole structure for form factors expressed as @xmath34 which is a reasonable approximation in our case .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath35 is found after the fit of the electromagnetic form factors by monopole approximation in the low momentum transfer region .",
    "further details on how couplings where implemented in the computational model are given in the appendix .      in order to define the next - to - leading - order hadronic corrections",

    "@xmath41 can be defined as an one - loop contribution to the parity - violating form factor , normalized by the fermi constant , @xmath42 .",
    "a calculation of nlo form factors is related to the calculations of loop integrals represented by three topological classes : box , self energy , and vertex ( triangle ) graphs . to preserve gauge invariance we have to include all the possible bosons of the standard model in these topological classes .",
    "taking into account that in the thooft - feynman gauge the contribution coming from the higgs scalar and gauge fixing fields is negligible , we choose to consider boxes and nucleon vertex corrections ( triangles ) with @xmath43 and @xmath44 vector bosons only .",

    "we accounted for all the possible particles in the standard model .",
    "accordingly , we consider nlo corrections for every class .",
    "the precise formulae for an entire set of graphs are cumbersome , and it is not feasible to show them in the present work . here , we provide some details for @xmath0 boxes only .",
    "our complete calculations are shown in @xcite .",
    "the full set of diagrams applicable for this case can be found in @xcite .    according to the feynman rules ( see , for example @xcite ) , the amplitude for a @xmath0 box ( see fig.([f1.1 ] ) )",
    "can be written as :     box diagram in the electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "[ f1.1 ] ]    @xmath46    in order to integrate the amplitude in eq.([e1.4 ] ) and the rest of the nlo loop integrals using _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ , it is necessary first to create a model file with declarations of all the fields participating in interaction and second to describe all the possible couplings of the fields on both generic and particle levels . for the case of electron - nucleon scattering , the only new particles in the model besides the particles of the standard model are neutron and proton , so it is rather straightforward to declare them in the _ feynarts _ model file . on other hand , the description of the couplings according to the eq.([e1.5 ] ) and eq.([e1.6 ] ) in the _ feynarts _ represents a certain problem . because we use the monopole form factor approximation ( see eq.([e1.9 ] ) )",
    ", it introduces momentum dependence in the coupling s denominator . for _ feynarts _ to deal with momentum - dependent couplings with momentum dependence introduced in the denominator , these couplings have to be described as propagators . of course , a propagator introduced in the coupling conflicts with the declaration of the fields in the _ feynarts _ model files which use the same propagator notation .",
    "we can solve the problem by transferring the monopole form factor from the coupling part of model to the part where fields are described using propagator notation . for boxes that can be achieved by starting with the general definition of a four - point tensor integral of rank @xmath47 in the form @xmath48 by adding the monopole form factor approximation into the above definition",
    ", we obtain a six - point tensor integral which can be reduced into a combination of four - point integrals by using the following expansion : @xmath49 here @xmath50 represents the last two terms of the product in eq.([e1.19 ] ) multiplied by the two monopole form factors of the box diagram .",
    "explicitly , the right - hand side of eq.([e1.20 ] ) can be written in the form@xmath51 substitution of the last equation into amplitude eq.([e1.4 ] ) results in an expansion where each term of the sum represents an amplitude constructed for electron - nucleon scattering with the point - like nucleon .",
    "also , in this consideration , the couplings between nucleon and vector bosons are multiplied by the factor @xmath52 , and the structure of the second , third and fourth terms of eq.([e1.20a ] ) suggests the introduction of fictitious vector boson particles @xmath53 with fixed masses @xmath54 .",
    "these bosons have no physical meaning , of course , but they allow us to remove momentum dependence in the denominator of the coupling .",
    "now we can model couplings between nucleon and vector fields using eq.([e1.5 ] ) and eq.([e1.6 ] ) with a monopole form factor moved into the definition of propagators for the new vector fields such as @xmath53 where @xmath55 . a diagrammatic representation of the proposed expansion",
    "is given by the set of feynman graphs in fig.([fhdr1.3 ] ) .",

    "formcalc_. we should note that eq.([e1.4 ] ) is written for the @xmath0 box diagram only . to have a complete analysis , it is necessary to consider @xmath57 , @xmath0 and @xmath57 crossed boxes as well .",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 box diagrams should be considered , too .",
    "our calculations include 36 boxes in total .      in total , 116 self - energy graphs and 6 counterterms contribute to the pv @xmath60 amplitude .",
    "this includes gauge and the gauge - fixing fields , the higgs field , and virtual leptonic and quark pairs in creation - annihilation processes in the loops .",
    "moreover , the vertex @xmath61 does not belong to the loop integrals and plays the role of a multiplicative factor proportional to the coupling defined in eq.([e1.5 ] ) and eq.([e1.6 ] ) . in _",
    "the self - energy loop integrals can be evaluated using the expansion given in the fig.([fhdr1.4 ] ) , and then tensor decomposition and tensor reduction techniques applied , leaving the final result as a combination of one and two point scalar integrals which we compute using gauss integration subroutines of _",

    "factor @xmath52 used for the couplings of the box diagrams should be replaced by one.[fhdr1.4 ] ]    to cancel ultraviolet divergences we employ an on - shell renormalization scheme according to @xcite .",
    "we have to assume that quarks in the self - energy loops are free , but it places certain constraints . since quarks are confined , a qcd strong quark - quark interaction should always be considered .",
    "it is possible to bypass these complications by replacing quarks with pions , or use `` free '' quarks but with adjusted effective masses . here",
    ", we use the second approach with the effective mass of the quarks coming from a fit of hadronic vacuum polarization to the measurements of qed cross section of the process @xmath62hadrons normalized to the qed @xmath63 cross section .",
    "the real part of the renormalized hadronic vacuum polarization satisfies the dispersion relation : @xmath64 with @xmath65 being a very well known experimental quantity and used here as an input parameter .    ]",
    "hadronic vacuum polarization @xmath66 is related to the truncated @xmath67 renormalized self - energy ( see fig.([hdrvp ] ) ) by the following expression : @xmath68 which can be easily evaluated by employing the free quark approximation .",
    "an updated value of the dispersion integral , along with a logarithmic parametrization , can be taken from @xcite .",
    "a new reported value coming from the light quark contribution at @xmath69 is @xmath70 .",
    "this value can be reproduced by eq.([e1.33 ] ) using the following masses of the light quarks : @xmath71 ( corresponds to @xmath72 ) .",
    "clearly , the values of the light quark masses at low - q scattering processes should be adjusted by using this approach , but with @xmath73 calculated in the region of @xmath74  gev .",
    "the simple logarithmic parametrization can be used here to extract quark masses at low momentum transfer : @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 parameters taken from @xcite . for low - momentum transfer experiments , the c.m.s .",
    "energy is @xmath74 @xmath78 , which gives , @xmath79 .",
    "the vertex correction contributions can be split into two classes . in the first class , where the electron vertex is at the one - loop level",
    ", the amplitude is calculated according to @xcite . as in the case of the self - energy graphs ,",
    "the hadronic vertex does not belong to the loop integrals , and therefore the pv amplitude is constructed according to the sm feynman rules employed in the _ feynarts _ package .",
    "generally , the electron vertex corrections have an infrared divergence at @xmath80 and are treated by the bremsstrahlung contribution considered in @xcite .    the second class of the triangle graphs are hadronic vertex corrections . in this case , to evaluate the amplitude automatically using the packages _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ , we construct an expansion similar to that given for the box diagrams . to work out the set of rules for the triangle topology , it is sufficient to consider the example in fig.([vr.cr.z.ex ] ) .    ]    for the graph in fig.([vr.cr.z.ex ] ) , the amplitude denominator has the structure @xmath81 which can be easily expanded into @xmath82 here , the coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equal to @xmath52 respectively .",
    "@xmath85 , and @xmath86 can be calculated using the following formulae : @xmath87 the expansion of the amplitude denominator in eq.([e1.35 ] ) has a simple graphical representation ( see fig.([hdr.vert.exp ] ) ) and suggests , in this particular case of the triangle topology , that a set of virtual particles @xmath88 and @xmath89 should be introduced in the nlo hadronic vertex corrections .     and @xmath89 partners.[hdr.vert.exp ] ]",
    "although ultraviolet divergences are absent in the hadronic vertex corrections due to the additional terms proportional to @xmath90 in the coupling , it is still necessary to compute the wave function renormalization with some details given in the appendix . as well as in the case of electron vertex corrections",
    ", the nucleon vertex will have an infrared divergence at the pole @xmath80 ( for the proton ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the treatment of this type of divergence is given in @xcite .",
    "the application of the methods described above for @xmath60 scattering can be found in calculations of the weak charges of the nuclei .",
    "consider the parity - violating hamiltonian in eq.([i1.4 ] ) . here ,",
    "for a heavy nucleus we have a coherent effect for @xmath91 : @xmath92 the contribution coming from @xmath93 is small as it depends on unpaired valence nucleons .",
    "the latter determines the hamiltonian for the electron parity - violating interaction with the nucleus in the following form : @xmath94 a relation between the weak charge @xmath95 and form factors @xmath96 is straightforward : @xmath97 if we take into account only the leading order of the interaction , the weak charge of the proton and neutron have the simple definitions : @xmath98 and for the nucleus @xmath99 where @xmath100 @xmath101 are the weak charges of the proton and neutron including nlo corrections .    as one can see from fig.([c1np.1 ] ) , the input of the nlo corrections is much more significant for the proton than for the neutron .",
    "this makes experiments involving neutrons more interesting , as they allow for the cleaner weak charge extraction .     and @xmath102 .",
    "the dotted line represents parity - violating form factor at the tree - level ( lo ) only , and the solid line shows the result with nlo contribution included ( lo+nlo ) .",

    "this justifies to some extent our choice of the monopole form factor approximation .",
    "extrapolation of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 to zero momentum transfer point ( see fig.([c1np.1 ] ) ) gives : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the most important of these numbers is the result for @xmath108 it has been evaluated most recently in @xcite , leading to @xmath109 .",
    "the available results from atomic parity - violating experiments for the weak charges of @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xcite and references within , and @xcite ) can be used as an experimental test of the theoretical predictions : @xmath112 here , the errors are statistical , systematic and coming from an uncertainty of the atomic - physics theory , respectively . for example , in the case of @xmath113 one should observe @xmath114 parity - violating electric dipole transitions in order to extract the weak charge of @xmath115 this requires an accurate knowledge of the atomic wave functions .",
    "some of the analysis of the issues involved , with an extensive reference list , is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "using eq.([d1.3 ] ) and eq.([d1.5 ] ) we compute the following results for the corresponding nuclear weak charges : @xmath116 which clearly agree with the experiment .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is estimated quite generously and comes mostly from the numerical integration and the extrapolation to the zero momentum transfer point . although the nlo corrections contribute only @xmath117 to the results in eq.([d1.7a ] ) , their value is still about four times larger than our theoretical uncertainty . thus , the more precise is the experiment ( like @xmath118 ) , the more important it becomes to evaluate most carefully the full set of the applicable nlo corrections .",
    "although our model predictions for the nuclear weak charges are in good agreement with the available experimental results , to allow more definitive conclusions about the validity of the proposed computational model , the experimental errors for precision measurements of the weak charge of the nucleon will have to be reduced .    any significant deviation of the weak charge of the proton from the standard model prediction at low @xmath119 would be a signal of new physics . the proton s weak charge @xmath120 is a well - defined experimental observable . at @xmath121",

    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "it will allow one to determine the proton s weak charge with @xmath1264% combined statistical and systematic errors , which leads to @xmath127 for the running of the weak mixing angle . the standard model evolution predicts a shift of @xmath128 at low @xmath119 with respect to the @xmath129 pole best fit value of @xmath130 the weak mixing angle at the energy scale close to the @xmath129 pole was measured very precisely , but a precision experimental study of the evolution of @xmath131 to lower energies still has to be carried out .",
    "the asymmetry measurements proposed for @xmath95 experiment will go as low as @xmath132 , making it a very competitive experiment .    using the dirac and pauli form factors",
    ", we can now compute the extensive set of one - loop hadronic electroweak nlo corrections along with the weak charges of the proton and neutron . using a monopole approximation for the form factors , we modified general electroweak couplings by inserting the appropriate form factors into the vertices .",
    "the monopole structure of the form factors allows us to substitute one feynman diagram with `` structured '' nucleon with a set of diagrams involving only point - like nucleon .",
    "this expansion can be visualized by adding fictitious additional vector bosons of mass @xmath133 . for renormalization , we choose the on - shell renormalization scheme .    in conclusion ,",
    "it is evident that computational symbolic packages such as _ feynarts _ and _ formcalc _ can be efficiently adapted for the theoretical evaluation of nlo effects in electron - nucleon scattering .",
    "refs @xcite and @xcite give some additional details .",
    "a newly proposed measurement of the electron weak charge in parity - violating moller scattering at 12 gev at jlab could be a very interesting challenge , for example .",
