    "the standard procedure to study the underlying event ( ue ) characteristics starts with defining regions of the azimuthal detector acceptance based on the direction of the leading charged jet @xcite or the leading track @xcite in an event .",
    "these regions , each of them covering an equal angle of @xmath0 are called towards , transverse and away .",
    "the toward and away regions are expected to contain the tracks that are produced by the fragmentation of the partons that took part in the hard scattering while the transverse region is expected to collect tracks from the ue .",
    "alice @xcite has characterized the ue in pp collisions at @xmath1 = 0.9 and 7 tev in @xcite by measuring the charged particle density , summed @xmath2 and azimuthal correlations ( between the leading track and the remaining tracks from the event ) in the above mentioned regions .",
    "this study presents an estimator for the multiplicity of the underlying event of proton - proton collisions and then uses it to characterize the properties of charged jets in different ranges of the underlying activity .",
    "thus , this study allows to characterize the interplay between the low momentum transfers related to the underlying activity and the hard partonic interactions that produce jets .",
    "the experimental results presented in this work are based on a sample of 172 million minimum bias pp collisions at @xmath1 = 7 tev .",
    "charged tracks were reconstructed using the inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the combined information from the its and the tpc provide a uniform acceptance of tracks as well as good momentum resolution .",
    "details about the track selection used in the charged jet analysis in alice can be found in @xcite .",
    "the jet activity is identified using a jet finder algorithm . for this work we use the siscone jet finder @xcite which is a seedless infrared - safe cone algorithm .",
    "the jet finding is performed using charged particles with @xmath3 1 gev/@xmath4 and a cone radius of @xmath5=0.4 as input parameters for the algorithm .",
    "the minimum jet transverse momentum was set to 5 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the ue definition is that it comprises all the activity in the event but that related to the hardest scattering in a pp collision . in this work",
    "we propose to use a jet finding algorithm to identify the orientation in the @xmath6 space of the products of the jet fragmentation and then characterize the underlying activity in the regions where the jet finder had not identified jet fragmentation activity .",
    "we developed a multiplicity estimator to characterize the um following a suggestion by frankfurt , strikman and weiss who discuss the transverse nucleon structure in @xcite . in that paper",
    "it is suggested to associate the multiplicity to the impact parameter of the pp collision .",
    "therefore we propose in this work to use a multiplicity estimator , that is not biased by the multiplicity created by the jet fragmentation , to access experimentally the centrality of the pp collision .",
    "this provides also a test of the implementation of pp centrality in modern mc generators , which contain simplifications such as the assumption of factorization of the parton @xmath7 and the impact parameter as well as the lack of information of the flavor and @xmath7 dependence of the proton s transverse composition as described in @xcite .",

    "the drawing represents the acceptance of the alice tpc in the @xmath8-@xmath9 space .",
    "the dark blue ( colors in the online version ) circle shows the jet area covered by the jet cone with radius @xmath5 .",
    "the grey rectangular area is the di - jet area .",
    "the width of the excluded di - jet area in the @xmath9 direction is 2@xmath5 and covers the whole acceptance in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the dotted lines represent the maximum limits for the @xmath8 coordinate of the accepted jet axis , so the complete jet area falls inside the tpc acceptance . ]",
    "the um estimation is based on the separation of the event phase space into two regions : one that contains jet activity and the complementary region .",
    "the um is calculated using the charged tracks measured within the tpc acceptance ( @xmath10 0.9 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the first classification of the tracks from the events is done by their transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath2 cutoff of the jet finder ( 1 gev/@xmath4 ) has been chosen to allow for a gap between this cutoff and the transverse momentum of the tracks that are used in the multiplicity estimation .",
    "therefore we define as the total tpc multiplicity those tracks that have 150 mev/@xmath4 @xmath12 900 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the second requirement to select tracks for the um comes from the geometry of the event , this selection can be easily explained using figure [ fig : figtpcacc ] .",
    "the figure shows the @xmath8 and @xmath9 acceptance of the alice tpc . to calculate the soft tpc multiplicity",
    ", that corresponds to the um measured in the alice central barrel , the tracks that fall into two areas of the acceptance are not taken into account in the multiplicity estimation .",
    "the first area is shown in figure [ fig : figtpcacc ] as a circle that corresponds to the jet cone with axis coordinates @xmath13=0.5 and @xmath14=@xmath15/2 in this example .",
    "the second area that is excluded is the di - jet area , centred at @xmath16=@xmath14+@xmath15 , having a width in the @xmath8 axis of @xmath17 and covering the whole acceptance in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "figure [ fig : figtpcsofttot ] shows the distribution of the mean values of the soft tpc multiplicity , shown with black markers , as a function of the total tpc multiplicity defined above .",
    "the figure shows as well , using a dashed line , the values of the soft tpc multiplicity that would be expected in the case that the reduction in the multiplicity is caused only by a geometrical exclusion .",
    "the experimental result shows that the soft tpc multiplicity is a fraction of the geometry expectation and increases linearly as a function of the total tpc multiplicity .",
    "soft tpc multiplicity as a function of the total tpc multiplicity .",
    "the figure shows the experimental measurements as well as the expectation values from a pure geometrical exclusion . ]",
    "the jet observable that is used in this work to characterize the fragmentation properties of the charged jets is called _ nt90_. _ nt90 _ was proposed in @xcite as an observable that can be used to discriminate jets originating from quark or gluon fragmentation .",
    "_ nt90 _ is constructed by selecting the tracks that are contained in the jet cone and that fulfil the same @xmath2 cutoff used during the jet finding .",
    "this set of tracks is then sorted according to their transverse momentum going from the highest to the lowest in magnitude .",
    "then one adds the @xmath2 of the sorted tracks until 90% of the total charged jet transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) is recovered .",
    "_ nt90 _ is the minimum number of tracks necessary to recover 90% of the total @xmath18 .",

    "one can notice that the mean value of _",
    "nt90 _ at a fixed value of the @xmath18 is larger for gluon initiated jets than for quark initiated jets .",

    "the ratio is between a bin with low um , @xmath19__nt90__@xmath20 , and a bin with high um , @xmath19__nt90__@xmath21 .",
    "the bin with low um has a soft tpc multiplicity smaller than 0.4 times the mean soft tpc multiplicity @xmath12 900 mev/@xmath4 that are outside the areas related with jet fragmentation . ] and the one with high um is associated to a soft tpc multiplicity larger than 1.2 times the mean soft tpc multiplicity . from the figure",
    "one can see that the jet properties from the two jet samples are different .",
    "the mean values of the _ nt90 _ from the jets associated to high um are larger than those associated to low values of the um .",
