    "starting more than a decade ago considerable observational evidence has been obtained indicating that planets are able to exist in stellar binary ( and higher order ) systems ; see results and discussions by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these observations are in line with the empirical finding that binary ( and higher order ) systems occur in high frequency in the local galactic neighborhood @xcite . for example , @xcite presented results of a detailed analysis of companions to solar - type stars , based on a sample size of 454 , and concluded that the overall fractions of double and triple systems are about 33% and 8% , respectively , if all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions are accounted for .",
    "updated results were meanwhile given by @xcite .",
    "this study shows that 57 exoplanet host stars are identified having a stellar companion .",
    "the fairly frequent occurrence of planets in binary systems is furthermore consistent with the presence of debris disks in a considerably large number of main - sequence star binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in principle , as discussed by @xcite , planets in binary systems can be identified through two different venues : first , binaries or multiple star systems can be surveyed for the presence of planets by utilizing the established detection methods .",
    "second , stars with detected planets can be scrutinized afterward to check if they possess one or more widely separated stellar companion(s ) ; in this case , the planet(s ) will also be categorized as belonging to a binary ( or higher order ) system .    from the view point of orbital mechanics , there are two different kinds of possible orbits ( notwithstanding positions near the lagrangian points l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 ) for planets in binary systems : s - type and p - type orbits @xcite .",
    "a p - type orbit is given when the planet orbits both binary components , whereas in case of an s - type orbit the planet orbits only one of the binary components with the second component behaving as a perturbator .",
    "@xcite presented a list of 15 planet - bearing binary systems with all planets in s - type orbits .",
    "they constitute mostly wide binaries with separation distances of up to @xmath26400  au ; however , smaller separation distances on the order of 20  au or less have also been identified . in the meantime , systems with planets in p - type orbits have also been identified .",
    "arguably , the most prominent case is kepler-16 , as reported by @xcite and previously suggested by @xcite , containing a saturnian mass circumbinary planet . @xcite",
    "have subsequently studied this system regarding the possibility of habitable exoplanets and habitable exomoons .",
    "recently , a transiting circumbinary multiplanet system , i.e. , kepler-47 , has also been identified @xcite .    there is a significant body of literature devoted to the study of habitability / h@xmath3o / n@xmath3 atmosphere ( see sect .  2 for details ) .",
    "more sophisticated approaches to habitability have been given in the meantime taking into account additional aspects , such as the planet s size and mass , atmospheric structure and composition , magnetic field , geodynamic properties , ionizing stellar uv and x - ray fluxes , and tidal locking ( if existing ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . additionally ,",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , planets with sufficiently thick atmospheres may remain habitable even when temporarily absent from their hzs due to orbits of considerable ellipticity .",
    "this possibility is disregarded in the following as well , as planets will be required to stay permanently in the chz , ghz , or ehz ( see sect .  2 for definitions ) , as applicable , to be considered habitable .",
    "] in binary systems as well as in multiplanetary systems , which often also encompass stellar evolutionary considerations .",
    "examples include the work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an important aspect that has received increased recognition in the literature is that in order for habitability to exist and to be maintained , a joint constraint that includes both orbital stability and a habitable environment for a system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes needs to be met .",
    "in the framework of this paper , the zone related to this latter requirement will subsequently be referred to as _ radiative habitable zone _ ( rhz ) , which constitutes a necessary , though often insufficient , condition for the existence of circumstellar habitability .    previous work , mostly concentrated on the existence of habitability in single star multi - planetary systems , rendered the publication of detailed  stability catalogs \" for the habitability zones of extrasolar planetary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , @xcite quantified the dynamical habitability of 85 planetary systems by considering the perturbing influence of giant planets beyond the traditional hill sphere for close encounters with the theoretical terrestrial planets .",
    "they concluded that a significant fraction of the identified extrasolar planetary systems are unable to harbor habitable terrestrial planets .",
    "a statistical study on the stability of earth - mass planets orbiting solar - mass stars in presence of stellar companions focusing on both the statistical properties of ejection times and the general prospects of planetary habitability was given by @xcite .",
    "additional work providing stability assessments for various observed extrasolar planetary systems based on detailed stability maps was given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the orbital stability or planets in double - planet systems for binaries by supplying an analytic framework based on secular perturbation theory ; they also provided dynamical classification categories .",
    "additional stability analyses to assess the habitability of planetary systems based on detailed numerical simulations were given by @xcite and @xcite ; note that the study of @xcite also dealt with a limited cases of planets in double star systems in orbit either around one stellar component ( s - type ) or around both components ( p - type ) .    the study of planetary dynamics and habitable planet formation has meanwhile been described by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they show that earth - mass planets are , in principle , able to form in stellar binary systems , although many details of the relevant processes are not fully understood .",
    "the overarching conclusion of those investigations is that habitable planets in stellar binary ( and , as anticipated , in higher - order systems ) are , in general , possible , which is a stark motivation for providing a comprehensive study of s - type and p - type habitability in binary systems .",
    "the approach adopted in this study will be entirely analytic .",
    "specifically , it will consider both s - type and p - type habitable orbits in the view of the joint constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a system planet through the appropriate amount of the stellar radiative energy fluxes . in an earlier study",
    ", @xcite focused on s - type habitability in binary systems taking into account both circular and elliptical orbits for the stellar binary components ; this latter aspect is however beyond the scope of the present work as we solely focus on systems in circular orbits .",
    "numerical studies for p - type habitable environments with applications to kepler-16 , kepler-34 , kepler-35 and kepler-47 have been given by @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in sect .  2",
    ", we comment on the adopted main - sequence star parameters and single star habitability . in sect .  3",
    ", we introduce our theoretical approach suitable for stellar systems of the order of @xmath4 , although our focus will be on binary systems . in this regard",
    "both s - type and p - type orbits will be examined , and detailed mathematical criteria for the existence of s - type and p - type rhzs will be derived . in sect .  4 , we consider the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability for the establishment of circumstellar habitability .",
    "applications regarding s - type and p - type systems are given in sect .",
    "5 , whereas the habitability classifications s , p , st , and pt are introduced in sect .",
    "section  7 conveys our summary and conclusions .",
    "in this study , s - type and p - type habitability is investigated mostly pertaining to standard ( i.e. , theoretical ) main - sequence stars .",
    "the adopted stellar parameters , which are the stellar effective temperatures @xmath5 , the stellar radii @xmath6 ( which together allow to define the stellar luminosities @xmath7 ) , and the stellar masses @xmath8 are mainly based on the work by @xcite ( see his table b.1 ) that assumes detailed photospheric spectral analyses . for stellar spectral types with no data available , the missing data were computed by employing biparabolic interpolation .",
    "the exception , however , are data for stars of spectral type k5  v and below . in this regard we relied on the results from the spectral models of r.  l. kurucz and collaborators .",
    "they took into account hundreds of millions of spectral lines for a large set of atoms and molecules ; see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "the effective temperatures implied by these models are in close similarity to those given by @xcite for most types of stars ; however , @xcite reports consistently higher effective temperatures for stars of spectral type late - k and m ; for the latter , the difference amounts to nearly 300  k. table  1 depicts the stellar parameters adopted for the present work .",
    "an alternative approach expected to provide very similar results for either the stellar luminosity or the stellar mass ( with the other parameter taken as fixed ) is the employment of a mass  luminosity relationships applicable to main - sequence stars .",
    "the work by @xcite , as well as data from subsequent studies , yield @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 . at the high - mass end , this relationship holds until about @xmath16 .",
    "it also becomes increasingly inaccurate for low - mass m dwarfs .",
    "fortunately , the domains of applicability for eq .",
    "( 1 ) is consistent with most studies of binary habitability ; see , e.g. , @xcite as example .",
    "next we focus on single star habitability , i.e. , the evaluation of various limits of habitable zones ( hzs ) , which in the solar case shall be referred to as @xmath17 .",
    "previous work by , e.g. , @xcite distinguished between conservative ( chz ) and the generalized habitable zone ( ghz ) , which can also be evaluated for general main - sequence stars , and other types of stars as well .",
    "for the sun , the limits of the chz are given as 0.95 and 1.37  au ( @xmath18 = 2 and 4 , respectively ) , whereas for the ghz , they are given as 0.84 and 1.67  au ( @xmath18 = 1 and 5 , respectively ) ; see table  2 .",
    "the physical significance of the various kinds of hzs obtained by @xcite can be summarized as follows : the ghz is defined as bordered by the runaway greenhouse effect ( inner limit ) and the maximum greenhouse effect ( outer limit ) . concerning the latter it is assumed that a cloud - free co@xmath3 atmosphere is still able to provide a surface temperature of 273  k. the inner limit of the chz is defined by the onset of water loss . in this case , a wet stratosphere",
    "is assumed to exist where water is lost by photodissociation and subsequent hydrogen escape to space .",
    "furthermore , the outer limit of the chz is defined by the first co@xmath3 condensation attained by the onset of formation of co@xmath3 clouds at a temperature of 273  k ; see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for further details .",
    "table  3 conveys the results for the hzs for the different types of main - sequence stars of the present study with the different limits referred to as hz@xmath19 .    for the outer edge of circumstellar habitability ,",
    "even less stringent limits have been introduced in the meantime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are based on the assumption of relatively thick planetary co@xmath3 atmospheres as well as strong backwarming that may further be enhanced by co@xmath3 crystals and clouds .",
    "these limits , which in case of the sun correspond to 2.4  au @xmath20 , conform to the extended habitable zone ( ehz ) , have also been taken into account in our study , although the significance of the ehz has meanwhile been criticized as a result of detailed planetary radiative transfer models @xcite . moreover , in the framework of the present study , we also consider planetary earth - equivalent positions defined as @xmath21 and labelled as @xmath22 ; see table",
    "it is meant as an intriguing reference distance of habitability both regarding single stars and stellar binary systems .",
    "next we introduce the governing equations for investigating the rhzs of binary systems pertaining to both s - type and p - type orbits .",
    "this approach targets the requirement of providing a habitable region for a system planet based on the radiative energy fluxes of the stellar components .",
    "the requirement of planetary orbital stability will be disregarded for now ; it will be revisited in sect .",
    "the importance of orbital stability for allowing circumstellar habitability in stellar binaries will , however , be considered in an appropriate and consistent manner in the main body of the study .    for a star of luminosity @xmath23 , given in units of solar luminosity @xmath24",
    ", the distance @xmath25 of the habitability limit @xmath17 as identified for the sun , which may constitute either an inner or outer limit of habitability ( except @xmath26 ) , is given as @xmath27 in case of a multiple star system of order @xmath4 with distances @xmath25 , the limit of habitability related to @xmath17 is given as @xmath28    in eq .",

    "therefore , ordinarily , no @xmath17 dependence for @xmath31 should exist .",
    "however , the formulae by @xcite utilize previous results by @xcite who provided numerical values for limits of habitability for different types of stars considering various limit definitions ( i.e. , @xmath17 values identified for the sun ) . but",
    "@xcite used for the solar effective temperature an unusually low value of 5700  k instead of 5777  k as currently accepted ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . hence , transforming the polynomial fit based on the work by @xcite aimed at considering the correct solar effective temperature renders a weak dependence on @xmath17 for the @xmath31 values .",

    "the reason for the disallowance of the chz is that the rhl for @xmath211 , which is at 2.38  au , is located inside of the rhl for @xmath212 , given as 2.05  au . the same criterion ( see eq .",
    "40 ) also leads to a relatively small width of the radiative ghz , which extends between 2.16 and 2.66  au . at a binary separation of 2.0  au",

    "in fact , when the pairs @xmath195 and @xmath196 and @xmath203 are compared to one another , it is found that although the unequal - mass binary system has almost twice the combined stellar luminosity of the equal - mass binary system ( i.e. , 3.85 versus 2.0 @xmath24 ) , it still possesses much narrower chz , ghz , and ehz rhzs .",
    "in fact , it is found that the condition expressed as eq .",
    "( 40 ) is most readily met in cases of equal - mass binary systems of relatively small separation distances and mostly violated in systems of relatively large separation distances and/or unequal distributions of masses and , by implication , luminosities .",
    "various examples have been depicted in fig .  7 ; see discussion in sect .",
    "5.2.1 .    in summary ,",
    "although an unequal distribution of stellar masses within binary systems is identified as advantageous for facilitating planetary orbital stability , in consideration of that lower stability limits for p - type orbits occur for smaller mass ratios @xmath184 ( see sect .  4 ) , the situation for the existence of the rhzs is much less ideal , even for systems where the stellar primary is highly luminous owing to the behavior of the rhls . in this regard ,",
    "the radiative chz is in most jeopardy as @xmath165 constitutes the smallest bracket among the various kinds of hzs ( see table  2 ) .",
    "more fortunate scenarios are expected to occur for the radiative ghz and ehz , with the brackets given as @xmath216 and @xmath217 , respectively ; they are characterized by considerably larger widths , especially in case of equal - mass systems of stars with relatively high luminosities .",
    "another aspect of this study is to provide an appropriate classification of habitability applicable to general binary systems .",
    "previously , @xcite introduced the terminology of s - type and p - type orbits for system planets , which is now widely used by the orbital stability , planetary , and the astrobiology science communities .",
    "evidently , besides the assessment of orbital stability behaviors , these terms are also appropriate for classifying binary system rhzs , if existing . however ,",
    "following previous investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the results of the present work , the spatial domain of s - type and p - type habitability depicted by the rhzs is often adversely affected , and in some cases even nullified , by the requirement that system planets must be orbitally stable .",
    "thus , if the available extent of the s - type and p - type rhzs for the manifestation of habitability is truncated owing to the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability , these zones shall be referred to as st - type and pt - type , respectively , in the following .",
    "detailed results are given in table  10 , which provides an extensive summary of p , pt , st , and s - type habitability for both equal - mass and non - equal mass binary systems .",
    "the stellar masses are varied between @xmath213 and @xmath214 in increments of @xmath215 amounting to a total of 15 combinations .",
    "table  10 features the results for the pairings @xmath130 ( chz ) , @xmath131 ( ghz ) , and @xmath132 ( ehz ) . in principle",
    ", it is found that  with the secondary taken as fixed  the higher the mass and , by implication , the luminosity of the stellar primary , the larger values are obtained for p , pt , st , and s - type habitability . additionally , larger values for the limits of p ,",
    "pt , st , and s - type habitability are obtained regarding the ghz relative to the chz , as expected .",
    "the largest values are obtained for pt and s - type habitability for the ehz ; in this regard , there is no change for p and st - type habitability relative to the ghz since both types of hzs are based on the same inner bracket value of @xmath218 ( see above ) .",
    "the results of table  10 are in line with the previously discussed findings about highly unequal intrabinary distributions of masses and , by implication , stellar luminosities as , e.g. , @xmath204 and @xmath205 or @xmath196 and @xmath203 compared to the case of @xmath195 . for systems of highly unequal mass distributions , the domains of p - type and pt - type habitability are typically relatively small as the rhl for @xmath67 crosses the rhl for @xmath68 in relatively close proximity to the primary , such allowing only small distance ranges to exhibit p / pt - type habitability .",
    "it is also found that in seven cases for the chz , as well as two cases for the ghz , the rhzs expire prior to the truncation of habitability due to the planetary orbital stability requirement . in those cases ,",
    "only p - type habitability exists ; no pt - type habitability is found as the orbital stability constraint bears no relevance .",
    "figure 8 and 9 show various combinations of equal - mass and nonequal - mass binary systems ; they all show numerous similarities , though the spatial scales are noticeably different as they are defined through the stellar luminosities . if equal - mass binary systems are considered , taking @xmath195 and @xmath219 as examples , the extent of both p and pt - type habitability increase with increasing stellar mass or luminosity . the distances for p and pt habitability",
    "are found to almost coincide indicating that the orbital stability constraint affects the inner and outer limit of p - type habitability in about the same manner .",
    "furthermore , the inner and outer limits of both s and st habitability are shifted to larger distances from each stellar component for stars of higher luminosity , as expected . moreover , for stars of higher luminosity , there is a larger spatial domain where s - type habitability is truncated due to the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability . for equal - mass systems of @xmath198 ,",
    "st and s - type habitability is identified at distances of 6.85 and 13.46  au , whereas for @xmath213 , st and s - type habitability is identified at 1.38 and 3.00  au .",
    "figure 9 depicts two selected cases of nonequal - mass binary systems . in both cases",
    "the stellar primary is chosen as 1.0  @xmath199 , whereas the stellar secondary is chosen as 0.75  @xmath199 and 0.5  @xmath199 , respectively ; the corresponding stellar luminosities of the secondaries are 0.357 and 0.045  @xmath24 , respectively ( see table 5 ) .",
    "a reduced luminosity of the secondary binary component adversely affects the extent of the rhz , as expected .",
    "interestingly , a reduction of mass for the stellar secondary has a nontrivial impact on the orbital stability domains , which considerably depend on the mass ratio @xmath184 ( see eqs . 46 and 47 ) .",
    "if @xmath184 is reduced , the permissible stability domain for p - type orbits is increased , whereas the permissible stability domain for s - type orbits is decreased .",
    "thus , the assessment of s , p , st , and pt habitability for nonequal - mass binaries requires a detailed computational analysis . in the example of fig .  9 , in regard to @xmath205 , s , p , st , and pt habitability occurs at distances of 0.82 , 1.16 , 6.18 , and 12.19  au , respectively , and for @xmath203 , s , p , st , and pt habitability occurs at distances of 0.94 , 1.01 , 5.50 , and 10.86  au , respectively .",
    "the respective differences are notable , but not drastic ; more pronounced differences occur for systems of more luminous stars ( see table  10 ) .",
    "note that both figs .",
    "8 and 9 refer to habitability assessments pertaining to the ghz ( see table  2 ) .",
    "they are given to exemplarily showcase the structure , extent and location of the s - type and p - type rhzs as well as the relevance of the orbital stability limits for both s - type and p - type habitability , thus allowing us to uniquely identify the spatial domains of s , p , st , and pt - type habitability for each system .",
    "computationally , the occurrence of p , pt , st , and s - type habitability can be identified as follows . for sufficiently small binary separations",
    "@xmath143 , it is found that both the inner and outer limit of the p - type rhz are located beyond of the p - type orbital stability limit ( see eq .",
    "47 ) , which constitutes a lower limit of planetary orbital stability ( see sect .  4 ) . if the distance of binary separation is increased , the inner and outer limits of the p - type rhz decrease , whereas the p - type orbital stability limit increases .",
    "thus , starting at a certain value of @xmath143 , only a fraction of the width of the p - type rhz will be available for providing habitability ; in this case , pt - type habitability is attained .",
    "if the binary separation is further increased , the entire width of the p - type rhz will be unavailable for providing habitability because habitability would be incompatible with the orbital stability constraint .",
    "eventually , the p - type rhz expires ; see also information provided in table  9 .    for mid - sized values of the binary separation distance ,",
    "the s - type rhz is encountered to exist , but it is unable to provide habitability because of the s - type orbital stability limit ( see eq .",
    "46 ) , which constitutes an upper limit of planetary orbital stability ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "the s - type rhzs continue to exist further out ; note that the inner and outer limits of the s - type rhzs essential continue to run parallel as function of the binary separation distance for most systems .",
    "if the binary separation distance @xmath143 is further increased , again as part of our numerical experiment , the s - type orbital stability will increase and will cross the inner limit of the s - type rhz ; in this case , st - type habitability is encountered as some , but not all of the width of the s - type rhz is available for providing habitability . eventually , for sufficiently large binary separations , the s - type orbital stability limit also crosses the outer limit of the s - type rhz . in this case",
    ", the full width of the s - type rhz is available for facilitating habitability , consistent with the definition of s - type habitability .",
    "another application is displayed in fig .",
    "it shows for a given spectral type of equal - star binaries the stellar separation distances @xmath143 for which chzs , ghzs , and ehzs are able to exist .",
    "the chzs , ghzs , and ehzs can be either s or st - type , on one hand , or p or pt - type , on the other hand , to qualify for depiction .",
    "the results are given as function of stellar spectral type , for stars between spectral type f0 to m0 .",
    "the figure shows that p / pt - type habitable regions are able to exist for a relatively large range of separation distances in case of relatively luminous stars ( i.e. , spectral type f ) , but only for a relatively small range of separation distances for lesser luminous stars ( i.e. , spectral types k and m ) .",
    "regarding s / st - type habitable regions the situation is reversed .",
    "figure 10 also indicates a notable domain of binary separations where no habitable regions are found owing to the lack of rhzs , the lack of planetary orbital stability , or both . moreover , no domain of binary separation distances is identified where s / st - type and p / pt - type habitable regions overlap .",
    "in this study we present a new method about a comprehensive assessment of s - type and p - type habitability in stellar binary systems .",
    "p - type orbits occur when the planet orbits both binary components , whereas in case of s - type orbits the planet orbits only one of the binary components with the second component considered a perturbator .",
    "an important characteristic of the new method is that it combines the orbital stability constraint for a system planet with the necessity that a habitable region given by the stellar radiative energy fluxes (  radiative habitable zone \" ) must exist .",
    "the requirement to combine these two properties has also been recognized in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another element of the present study is to introduce a habitability classification regarding stellar binary systems , consisting of habitability types s , p , st , and pt . this type of classification also considers whether or not s - type and p - type radiative habitable zones are reduced in size due to the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability . in summary ,",
    "five different cases were identified , which are : s - type and p - type habitability provided by the full extent of the rhz ; habitability , where the rhz is truncated by the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability ( labelled as st and pt - type , respectively ) ; and cases of no habitability at all .",
    "this classification scheme can be applied to both equal - mass and non - equal mass binary systems , as well as to systems with binaries in elliptical orbits , which will be the focus of the forthcoming paper  ii of this series . as part of the current study a significant array of results",
    "are given for a notable range of main - sequence stars , which are of both observational and theoretical interest .",
    "a key aspect of the proposed method is the introduction of a combined algebraic formalism for the assessment of both s - type and p - type habitability ; in particular , mathematical criteria are presented allowing to determine for which systems s - type and p - type rhzs are realized . in this regard ,",
    "a priori choices about the presence of s - type and p - type rhzs are neither necessary nor possible as the existence of s - type as well as p - type rhzs is proliferated through well - defined mathematical conditions pertaining to the underlying fourth - order algebraic equation .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomial are given by the binary separation distance ( @xmath143 ) , the solar system - based parameter for the limit of habitability ( @xmath17 ) , and the modified values for the luminosities ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) of the stellar binary components , referred to as recast stellar luminosities . regarding the binary system habitable zone , we consider conservative , general and extended zones of habitability , noting that their inner and outer limits are informed by previous solar system investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in our segment of applications",
    ", we examined the existence of habitable s - type orbits for selected examples .",
    "we found that regarding the rhzs , owing to the typically relatively large separation of the stellar components , the effect of the stellar secondary on the extents of the rhzs is usually very minor .",
    "the secondary s main influence on circumstellar habitability consists in imposing restrictions regarding planetary orbital stability implemented as an upper stability limit around each stellar component , which often truncates or nullifies s - type planetary habitability . in the framework of our study",
    ", we specifically considered the radiative ehz , which is most outwardly extented ( i.e. , up to 2.4  au in case of the sun ) .",
    "it was found that this kind of zone is most affected by the limitation of planetary orbital stability as it is located closest to the secondary stellar component .",
    "furthermore , we also examined the existence of habitable p - type orbits . in this case , relatively complicated scenarios emerge .",
    "in general , it was found that the best prospects for circumbinary habitability emerge for ( 1 ) systems with stellar components of relatively high luminosities ( no surprise here ! ) , ( 2 ) systems where the stellar luminosities are relatively similar ( for main - sequence stars , as implied by their stellar masses ) , and ( 3 ) systems of relatively small binary separations .",
    "if conditions ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) are not met , it may occur that the outer rhl is located inside of the inner rhl , thus nullifying the rhz irrespectively of planetary orbital stability considerations . on the other hand ,",
    "an unequal intrabinary distribution of masses entails a lower limit of planetary orbital stability ( i.e. , positioned closer to the binary system ) thus implying an enhanced opportunity for circumbinary habitability .",
    "however , this aspect is of lesser significance for most systems compared to the restrictions for the rhzs due to the imbalance given by the stellar luminosities .    various applications in this study concern stars of masses between 0.75 and 1.5  @xmath199 .",
    "this approach is motivated to unequivocally demonstrate the effects of stellar binarity on the extent and structure of circumstellar habitability , which is most pronounced for massive , i.e. , highly luminous stars .",
    "nonetheless , most stars in binaries are expected to be low - mass stars , i.e. , stars of spectral types k and m , owing to the skewness of the galactic initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , we compared pairs of systems given by ( 1.0  @xmath199 , 1.0  @xmath199 ) and ( 1.5  @xmath199 , 0.5  @xmath199 ) . obviously , the overall luminosity is by far greatest in the ( 1.5  @xmath199 , 0.5  @xmath199 ) system following the mass  luminosity relationship ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath220 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this system is found to be the highly unfavorable for the facilitation of circumbinary habitability .",
    "particularly , it is found that the p - type ghz in the ( 1.0  @xmath199 , 1.0  @xmath199 ) system extends to 0.91  au , whereas it extends only to 0.65  au in the ( 1.5  @xmath199 , 0.5  @xmath199 ) system .",
    "furthermore , smaller spatial extents are identified for p - type chzs , as this type of hz is in highest jeopardy owing to the relative small @xmath165 bracket compared to the @xmath216 bracket for ghzs ( see table  2 ) .",
    "in fact , a considerable number of systems do not offer chzs at all , which again is a consequence of the radiative imbalance in those systems . also , the nullification of chzs in binary systems is most likely to occur in systems of relatively large separation distance .",
    "in contrast , the best opportunities for facilitating circumbinary habitability is given in the context of ehzs , as expected .",
    "future work will deal with a significant augmentation of our method to other systems , including systems with binary components in elliptical orbits ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "this will allow us to compare applications of our method , including results for individual systems , to other findings in the literature .",
    "we also expect our method to be applicable to general binary systems with main - sequence stars as well as to systems containing evolved stars ; this latter effort is motivated by observational evidence and supporting theoretical efforts indicating that planets are also able to exist around stars that have left the main - sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "particularly , it is highly desirable to augment our method to systems of higher order , as motivated by the steady progress in theory as well as ongoing and future observational discoveries of exosolar planetary systems .",

    "<S> a comprehensive approach is provided to the study of both s - type and p - type habitability in stellar binary systems , which in principle can also be expanded to systems of higher order . </S>",
    "<S> p - type orbits occur when the planet orbits both binary components , whereas in case of s - type orbits the planet orbits only one of the binary components with the second component considered a perturbator . </S>",
    "<S> the selected approach encapsulates a variety of different aspects , which include : ( 1 ) the consideration of a joint constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a putative system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (  radiative habitable zone \" ; rhz ) needs to be met . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the treatment of conservative , general and extended zones of habitability for the various systems as defined for the solar system and beyond . ( 3 ) the providing of a combined formalism for the assessment of both s - type and p - type habitability ; in particular , mathematical criteria are presented for which kind of system s - type and p - type habitability is realized . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) applications of the attained theoretical approach to standard ( theoretical ) main - sequence stars . in principle , </S>",
    "<S> five different cases of habitability are identified , which are : s - type and p - type habitability provided by the full extent of the rhzs ; habitability , where the rhzs are truncated by the additional constraint of planetary orbital stability ( referred to as st and pt - type , respectively ) ; and cases of no habitability at all . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the treatment of planetary orbital stability , we utilize the formulae of holman & wiegert ( 1999 ) [ aj 117 , 621 ] as also used in previous studies . </S>",
