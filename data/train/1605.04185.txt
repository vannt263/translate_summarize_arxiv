    "one of the open questions in neutrino physics is the mass ordering of the neutrinos ; whether they are ordered normally or inverted .",
    "many experiments intend to determine the mass ordering , of which the 50 kton iron calorimeter ( ical ) detector at the proposed india - based neutrino observatory is one ambitious experiment @xcite .",
    "ical will be a magnetised iron calorimeter mainly sensitive to muons produced in the charged - current ( cc ) interactions of atmospheric muon neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) with the iron target in the detector .",
    "it can distinguish cc muon - neutrino - induced events from anti - neutrino - induced ones since the former interaction produces @xmath10 while the latter produces @xmath11 in the detector and ical has excellent muon charge identification ( cid ) capability .",
    "this is also crucial to determine precisely the momentum of the muons through bending in the magnetic field .",
    "since matter effects are different between neutrino and anti - neutrino propagation in the earth , this feature can help resolve the neutrino mass ordering by determining the sign of the 23 mass - squared difference @xmath12 , @xmath13 , being the neutrino mass eigenstates @xcite .",
    "in addition , the matter effects improve the sensitivity to the magnitude @xmath14 of this mass - squared difference as well as to the 23 mixing angle , @xmath15 , provided the across - generation mixing angle @xmath16 is rather well - known , which is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "many previous analyses have been reported , projecting the sensitivities of ical detector to oscillation parameters in the 23 sector @xcite as also the mass ordering .",
    "the sensitivity to mass hierarchy is directly proportional to the value of @xmath16 which is quite precisely known @xcite .",
    "it also depends on the ability of ical to separate neutrino and anti - neutrino events which is possible since ical is magnetised . while there is an uncertainty of about 20% on the atmospheric neutrino fluxes themselves , the uncertainty on their _ ratios",
    "_ is much smaller , about 5% , and was ignored in earlier analyses @xcite . in this paper , we show that this smaller uncertainty on the ratio acts as a constraint that in turn significantly shrinks the allowed parameter space , especially for @xmath3 . for instance , we will see that the precision on @xmath3 decreases from 13% to 9% in a certain analysis mode when this constraint is included .",
    "this is generally true for all magnetised detectors . to our knowledge",
    "such an effect has not been discussed in the literature earlier .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "all the results in this paper are with detailed simulation studies of the physics processes at the ical detector .",

    "this is mainly done to reduce the effect of statistical ( monte carlo ) fluctuations on sensitivity studies , which may alter the results .",

    "inverted_. in fact , the best sensitivity ( @xmath43 = 0.525 gev , with 11 pulls and 3d binning ) is better with the inverted than with the normal hierarchy ( by @xmath54 16% ) .",
    "the reason for this effect with the 11@xmath56 pull is discussed in the next section .",
    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath53 are lower than those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , for the same exposure time .",
    "this is due to the fact that the earlier analysis used the input value @xmath57 while our analysis uses the current best fit value @xcite @xmath58 . given that the best fit of @xmath16 has reduced further to @xmath59 @xcite it is even more important to perform the analysis in as wide a kinematic range ( energy and direction ) as possible to get the best possible hierarchy discrimination .",
    "the sensitivity to mass ordering is also known to depend on the true value of @xmath15 ; it is higher for larger @xmath15 as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hie-23 ] . while ical has better sensitivity to the inverted ordering when @xmath15 is in the first octant , the reverse is true when it is in the second octant .",
    "this is due to the dominance of the @xmath60 term in eq .",
    "[ toteve ] arising from the survived @xmath0s compared to the @xmath61 term from oscillated @xmath18s , and the nature of its dependence on @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , the results would also be vastly improved by `` switching off '' the @xmath61 term since their dependence on the oscillation parameters ( especially @xmath15 ) are practically the opposite of each other @xcite .",
    "this is not possible with atmospheric neutrinos where nature provides both flavours , but is possible with neutrino beams . in the latter case",
    ", however , the fact that there is a single base - line which results in a significant dependence on and correlation with the cp violating phase @xmath36 and complicates the analysis , as with minos @xcite , t2k @xcite , lbne @xcite or no@xmath62a @xcite .     as a function of exposure time in years .",
    "it can be seen that the sensitivity to mass hierarchy increases linearly with the true value of @xmath15 when it is varied over the @xmath35 range of the parameter.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]   as a function of exposure time in years .",
    "it can be seen that the sensitivity to mass hierarchy increases linearly with the true value of @xmath15 when it is varied over the @xmath35 range of the parameter.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.0% ]    to summarise , the sensitivity to the mass ordering in the 23 sector improves with the addition of higher energy bins in the analysis , while constraining the @xmath63 flux ratio improves the sensitivity only when the true ordering is inverted . the ical s ability to determine this mass ordering is significant owing to its magnetisability and its 50 kton mass .",
    "improvement in energy resolutions will further improve the detector s sensitivity to this parameter .",
    "also , in ical , the mass ordering can be determined independent of the cp violating phase @xmath36 because of the range of baselines involved in atmospheric neutrinos @xcite ; this is in contrast to beam / short - base - line experiments where there is a non - trivial sensitivity to the 23 mass ordering depending on the true value of the cp phase .",
    "hence ical will be important in the determination of this mass ordering , and any amount of improvement in determining this parameter is noteworthy .",
    "the 11@xmath65 pull accounts for the fact that the _ ratios _ of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fluxes are better known ( to within 5% ) than the absolute fluxes themselves @xcite .",
    "this is implemented by using a pull @xmath66 , which contributes _ with the opposite sign _ for neutrino and anti - neutrino events , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ pi6-xi6 ] .",
    "it is seen that the inclusion of the 11th pull is most visible in the determination of @xmath15 which becomes more constrained when this pull is included .",
    "one way to understand this is to re - bin the events in a single variable @xmath67 ( of the final state muon ) and consider the effect of just this pull .",
    "[ fig : pull ] shows the effect of @xmath15 on both the neutrino and anti - neutrino events .",
    "the thick solid line is the `` data '' corresponding to @xmath68 while the thin solid  theory \" line corresponds to a fit with @xmath69 and without any pull . in both cases , reducing @xmath15 from the true value increases the event rate _ in every bin _ ( the opposite will hold with the inverted hierarchy ; here the normal hierarchy is shown ) .",
    "note that the down - going events are not shown here .     and",
    "@xmath1 events shown as a function of @xmath70 of the final state muon .",
    "the red ( thick solid ) lines correspond to the `` data '' and the black ( thin solid ) ones to the  theory \" with @xmath71 ( and other parameters held fixed ) .",
    "the green ( dashed ) lines ( practically overlapping the data ) and the blue ( dot - dashed ) lines mimic the effect of 10th pull and inclusion of the 11th pull respectively.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the dot - dashed and dashed curves corresponding to the labels 11- and 10-pulls show the effect of changing the ( single ) normalisation of the theory with and without the 11@xmath65 pull .",
    "the overall normalisation of the events in the 10-pull case can be _ independently _ varied for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ( decreased by 4% and 3% in figure ) to improve the agreement of the @xmath72 theory line to the data , resulting in smaller overall @xmath2 in this fit . on the other hand , a 2.5% decrease in the normalisation of neutrino - induced events in the 11-pull case",
    "is accompanied by a 2.5% _ increase _ in the anti - neutrino case , so that the agreement with the neutrino data becomes better , but that with the anti - neutrino data becomes worse .",
    "( of course , it can be applied vice versa , but the smaller @xmath2 is obtained with this choice since there are about twice as many neutrino events as anti - neutrino ones due to the smaller cross section of the latter . )",
    "hence it is not possible to improve the agreement of the @xmath72 theory with data by tuning the normalisation in the analysis when including this pull ; this results in a larger @xmath2 compared to the 10-pull case where the normalisations of neutrino- and anti - neutrino - induced events can be independently varied .",
    "this gives rise to the tighter constraints on @xmath15 when the 11th pull is added .",
    "we note that only a detector like ical that is capable of charge identification can successfully implement this pull as a constraint .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pull ] that there is greater sensitivity to @xmath15 in the neutrino rather than in the anti - neutrino sector .",
    "the reverse is true with inverted mass ordering . in the determination of the sensitivity to the mass ordering",
    ", the minimum @xmath2 with the false ordering is found .",
    "that means , when the true ordering is inverted , the `` theory '' is obtained using the normal ordering , where there is greater sensitivity to @xmath15 as just mentioned .",
    "when the 11th pull is included , therefore , the discrepancy between theory and data can not be achieved by changing @xmath15 and hence there is more sensitivity to determination of the mass ordering when the true ordering is inverted , provided @xmath15 is in the first octant .",
    "the reverse is true when @xmath15 is in the second octant , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hie-23 ] .    in addition",
    ", it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pull ] that there is sensitivity to oscillation parameters near and beyond @xmath73 .",
    "this is precisely the region that is included when the range of @xmath43 is extended from 1 gev down to 0.5 gev .",
    "similarly , although smaller , sensitivity to the parameters is also seen for @xmath743 , which corresponds to the extension in the higher energy end from 11 to 25 gev .",
    "this paper contains a simulation study of the physics potential of the proposed 50 kton magnetised iron calorimeter detector ( ical ) at ino which aims to probe neutrino oscillation parameters by observing atmospheric neutrino oscillations and studying their earth matter effects as they propagate through the earth .",
    "this will be done by detecting ( mainly ) the charged current interactions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the detector by means of the final state muons .",
    "the detector , which is optimised for the detection of muons in the gev energy range , will have a magnetic field which will enable the distinction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 events by identifying the charge of the muon in the final state , thus making ical an excellent detector to determine the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "not only this , the magnetic field helps to improve the precision measurement of the mixing angle @xmath15 ( and @xmath75 and the mass ordering as well ) .",
    "the main themes of our study were the effects of extending the observed muon energy range to 0.525 gev ( from 111 gev used in earlier studies ) and that of a constraint on the @xmath0@xmath1 flux ratio on the sensitivity of a 50 kton ical to neutrino oscillation parameters in the 23 sector .",
    "the second  and the aspect which is found to have the biggest impact so far on oscillation sensitivity  arises from two facts ; one that ical detects atmospheric neutrinos and the other that this massive detector will be magnetised .",
    "in particular , we show that the relatively small uncertainties on the atmospheric neutrino - antineutrino flux _ ratios _ act as a constraint in analyses where the neutrino and antineutrino events can be separated .",
    "this is true in a magnetised detector such as ical where the magnetic field distinguishes muons and anti - muons produced in charged current interactions of neutrinos and antineutrinos respectively with the detector material .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field enables ical to distinguish between neutrino and anti - neutrino events ; hence , inclusion of the uncertainty on the @xmath76 flux ratio as an additional pull translates to a constraint on this ratio which in turn significantly improves the precision with which @xmath3 can be determined .",
    "such a constraint is applicable for all magnetised detectors which have good charge identification capabilities and the impact of this constraint has been shown for the first time in this paper . as a consequence , our simulation studies show that , with 10 years of data taking , ical will not only be able to determine @xmath77 with good precision ( as expected ) but can also pin down @xmath3 to a precision better than the current limits set by t2k .",
    "the precision that can be achieved on these parameters in about 10 years running is about 2.5% and 9% for @xmath78 and @xmath3 respectively ; see details in tables  [ pre - tab - stt23 ] and [ pre - tab - dmeff2 ] .",
    "the studies presented here assume that there is perfect separation between different types of charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) events .",
    "the event separation efficiency will affect the results of the analysis since they will determine the actual number of events in each bin apart from the contamination from nc oscillation - independent events .",
    "however the inclusion of this consideration is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "preliminary studies @xcite show that certain selection criteria can be applied so that an event sample which comprises more than 95% cc muon events can be obtained .",
    "the criterion results in cutting out events with @xmath79 gev ; this has determined largely the range ( lower limit ) of muon energy analysed in this paper .",
    "also , improvements in the reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions ( that have been studied with geant-4 simulations of the detector ) as well as possible changes in detector geometry can all alter the results of this analysis .",
    "note that the current studies were all done with the atmospheric neutrino fluxes computed at the super kamiokande site @xcite .",
    "the fluxes at theni where ical is proposed to be built are slightly different and are smaller at energies less than 10 gev @xcite ; this will also impact the analysis .",
    "even within these limitations , it appears that the physics results of ical will have the capability to impact global fits to neutrino data and thus any new analysis will open a window to understanding the neutrino oscillation parameters better on the whole and the atmospheric neutrino fluxes themselves , in particular .",
    "as discussed in section  [ nevt ] , the analyses in the previous sections were done by taking a 1000 year sample of charged current muon neutrino events and scaling it down to the required number of years for comparison with `` data '' .",
    "it is important to reduce `` theory '' fluctuations so as to obtain a genuine result from the analysis .",
    "the effect of taking different years of exposure as theory samples , to be scaled to 10 years on precision measurements of @xmath15 and @xmath75 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ chi2-fluct ] for arbitrarily chosen values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 ev@xmath82 ( @xmath83 ev@xmath82 ) .",
    "it can be seen that a smaller sample has more fluctuations and hence yields a larger value of @xmath84 for a given parameter thus giving too good a precision on the oscillation parameter which is false .",
    "the larger sample takes care of this by reducing the ( @xmath85 ) fluctuations in the theory itself .",
    "the @xmath2 stabilises at a point when the sample is fairly large and this is the number of years of exposure to be taken and scaled down for the analysis . it can be seen that use of 1000 year sample yields fairly stable results and thus the analyses have made use of such a sample of charged current muon neutrino events .",
    "we note however that the results are much more sensitive to the sample size in the case of @xmath86 than for @xmath15 .     vs the number of years of sample theory to be scaled to 10 years for @xmath87 ( left ) and @xmath88 ( right ) .",
