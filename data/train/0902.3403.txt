    "stars form within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "a large fraction of these stars originate in embedded clusters ( lada & lada ) .",
    "the properties of these forming clusters , such as the mass function and the star formation efficiency , are hence inextricably linked to the properties of their natal molecular cloud .",
    "of particular importance is the turbulence within the clouds .",
    "thus , the study of the dynamics , structure and chemistry of gmcs plays a pivotal role in our understanding of the star formation process .    in order to study the turbulence within gmcs we can investigate their column density distribution and compare it to theoretical predictions for the volume density distribution which is found to be log - normal for isothermal flows ( e.g. passot & vzquez - semadeni @xcite and references therein ) . for a large number of clouds along the line of sight with a log - normal volume density distribution",
    "the column density distribution becomes normal .",
    "otherwise the column density distribution is log - normal ( vzquez - semadeni & garca @xcite ) .",
    "there are in principle a variety of ways in which the column density distribution of gmcs can be investigated .",
    "these include e.g. thermal continuum imaging of the cold dust , spectral line mapping of molecules such as co , or the determination of extinction maps .",
    "each of these methods has its own shortcomings , considering the accuracy and selection effects with which the real column density distribution in clouds can be mapped .",
    "a detailed discussion of this topic can be found in goodman et al . @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that near infrared extinction mapping might provide the best or least biased way to determine the column density distribution of clouds , given a constant gas to dust ratio .",
    "the mapping of extinction at optical and near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths can be performed using star counting ( e.g. wolf @xcite ) , colour excess techniques ( e.g. nice - lada et al .",
    "@xcite ; nicer - lombardi & alves ) , or a combination thereof ( e.g. lombardi ) . with the availability of large scale homogeneous surveys such as the digitized sky survey ( dss ; lasker @xcite ) or the two micron",
    "all sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "@xcite ) the possibility to map the extinction of entire cloud complexes in the milky way has arisen . in recent years a number of large scale maps have been created by various authors : dobashi et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter d05 ) used optical star counts to map the extinction along the entire galactic plane with @xmath3@xmath440@xmath5 ; froebrich et al .",
    "used star counts in 2mass to determine the relative extinction in the entire galactic plane with @xmath3@xmath420@xmath5 ; large scale maps ( e.g. pipe nebula , ophiuchus , lupus ) based on the nicer technique are presented e.g. by lombardi et al . ; a 127@xmath5@xmath663@xmath5 region towards the galactic anticentre region has been mapped by froebrich et al .",
    "@xcite using the nice technique .",
    "based on far infrared emission maps an all sky extinction map has been created by schlegel et al .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s98 ) .",
    "we plan to study the column density distribution of all clouds in the milky way accessible with the nice technique . as a first step we present here our",
    "all sky near infrared extinction maps based on 2mass .",
    "we have created a variety of maps using a fixed grid ( constant spatial resolution ) method , as well as a nearest neighbour ( constant noise ) approach .",
    "the resulting column density distributions of the clouds will be analysed in a forthcoming publication .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in sect.[method",
    "] we describe in detail the method used to determine the extinction maps , including the calibration and the uncertainties .",
    "the results are presented in sect.[results ] where we also compare our maps with the existing large scale extinction maps from d05 and s98 .",
    "a summary is presented in sect.[summ ] .",
    ".[avail ] the different maps created for the project .",
    "see text for details . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      there are , of course , other methods available to determine extinction maps based on nir photometry .",
    "these are in particular the nicer method presented by lombardi & alves , or the work presented by lombardi .",
    "these methods are based on the minimisation of the variance of the determined @xmath0 values by optimally combining the available colour and position information .",
    "naturally , these methods will have a smaller variance than our method .",
    "the reduction in noise when using the nicer method with respect to the simpler averaging of colour excess values applied by us is typically of the order of about 20% ( see e.g. froebrich et al .",
    "this would e.g. lower the 3@xmath7 detection limit in our standard map from 0.84mag to 0.70mag .",
    "however , possible variations / uncertainties in the applied extinction law , as well as small scale changes in the completeness limit ( see sect.[stat_uncertain ] ) result in similar size variations of the @xmath0 values .",
    "furthermore , this small gain in signal - to - noise has to be weighted against the immense additional computational costs of the more sophisticated methods .",
    "these computational costs , as well as the simplicity and robustness of the colour excess technique are hence the essential arguments for our choice of technique .",
    "we have created a number of all sky near infrared extinction maps for our project .",
    "the available maps are listed in table[avail ] .",
    "they will all be made available on the cds and can also be downloaded at http://astro.kent.ac.uk/extinction .    in the left panel of fig.[mainmap ]",
    "we show a grey scale representation of our all sky @xmath0 map using the nearest 49 stars .",
    "extinction values are scaled linearly between -1mag ( white ) and + 7mag ( black ) of optical extinction .",
    "the general distribution of dust along the plane of the galaxy is immediately visible , as well as the more nearby higher latitude clouds such as orion , ophiuchus , chameleon , taurus , etc .. the lack of any significant dust away from the galactic plane is also clear .",
    "features such as the large and small magellanic clouds can also be seen , and are caused by their red giants ( see the discussion above about the calibration of the maps ) .",
    "some low @xmath0 regions are noticeable in the southern half of the image , at latitudes of @xmath8 - 70 .",
    "the @xmath9 map of s98 shows material in these positions as well , indicating that the clouds are real . in appendix[highres ] we show detailed high resolution cut - outs of the entire 49@xmath1 nearest neighbour map for clarity .",
    "there we present 32@xmath641  sized images . for better contrast",
    "the extinction values are scaled by square root from 0mag to 15mag optical extinction .",
    "the map of the distance to the 49@xmath1 nearest neighbour star is shown in the right panel of fig.[mainmap ] .",
    "it varies from about 1  at @xmath80  to 10  at @xmath1090 .",
    "this clearly shows that the spatial resolution varies by about a factor of 10 from near the galactic plane to the poles in the image .",
    "the map further shows that the spatial resolution is better than 3  to 5  in all regions of interest , i.e. regions that contain giant molecular clouds , and generally better than 10  for @xmath1130 .",

    "since most of the selected stars have very similar photometric uncertainties , we named those maps _ constant noise maps_. on the other hand , the map using a fixed pixel size will use a different number of stars and hence result in a more variable noise .    in fig.[errac ]",
    "we plot the distribution of the one sigma variance in our map for a 25 square degree region near the galactic plane ( 2.5@xmath4@xmath13@xmath47.5 ; 221.67@xmath4@xmath14@xmath4226.67 ) . for the constant noise maps the peaks in the distributions are very narrow ( justifying the name ) , while for the constant resolution map the uncertainties vary by a much larger amount even in this rather small field of view .",
    "the main cause is that the covariance dominates the variance in the maps , as seen in sect.[stat_uncertain ] .",
    "there are some pixels in the constant resolution map where the noise and the extinction can not be determined since no stars are found in these pixels .",
    "note that the spatial resolution of the 49@xmath1 nearest neighbour map in the area for which the histograms are plotted is about a factor of three larger compared to the fixed pixel size map , which explains the larger values of the uncertainties in the latter .    for the constant noise maps the peaks in the variance distribution are at 0.21mag , 0.28mag , and 0.37mag for the 25@xmath1 , 49@xmath1 , and 100@xmath1 nearest neighbour map respectively .",
    "this means , that e.g. in the 49@xmath1 nearest neighbour map , the important threshold for self - shielding of molecular clouds of 1mag @xmath0 ( hartmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) is detected always with a signal - to - noise ratio of larger than three .              to validate our calibration and to compare our new map with existing works we facilitate the widely used all sky extinction map from s98 and the @xmath1540  map from d05 .",
    "d05 produced @xmath0 maps at angular resolutions of 6  and 18 , covering the sky in the galactic latitude range @xmath1640 .",
    "they performed star counts in the optical data from the digitized sky survey ( lasker @xcite ) .",
    "the wavelengths used lead to a better tracing of low extinction regions in their maps , but underestimate @xmath0 in areas of high extinction .",
    "s98 produced an all sky map of @xmath9 , intended for use as a new estimator of galactic extinction .",
    "they used data from cobe / dirbe and iras / issa maps . the diffuse emission from dust in the infrared",
    "can be used as a measure of column density once the temperature and emissivity is known .",
    "the resolution of the final @xmath9 map of s98 is 6.1 .      in fig.[serpens_comp ] we compare a section of our @xmath0 map ( left panel ) with the maps of d05 ( middle ) and s98 ( right ) .",
    "extinction values are scaled linearly between 0.5 and 20mag .",
    "the maps show a region ( 20@xmath1730  and 0@xmath1810 ) containing the serpens molecular cloud complex , that nicely illustrates the differences between the maps .",
    "the most obvious difference is the higher spatial resolution of our map ( between 2  and 4 ) compared to the other two maps ( about 6 ) .",
    "hence , much finer details , such as small , high column density cores and small scale structures are visible only in our new map .",
    "when comparing our map with d05 there are two further main differences : i ) there is a number of very high @xmath0 regions not detected in the d05 map ( e.g. the main serpens core ) .",
    "the reason is that optical star counts are not able to trace such high column densities .",
    "ii ) near the galactic plane ( positioned along the bottom of the image ) all but a few clouds are undetected in d05 .",
    "again the reason is the rather low penetration depth of the optical star counting technique .",
    "the near infrared colour excess method applied by us is able to trace much higher column density regions .",
    "however , high @xmath0 regions very close to the plane are also not picked up by our technique .",
    "these are regions where foreground stars dominate the stellar population and our median colour excess approach breaks down .",
    "such regions are apparent as ` white ' low extinction regions near the bottom in the left panel of fig.[serpens_comp ] .",
    "a comparison of our map with s98 also shows two main differences : i ) on average the @xmath0 values from s98 are about a factor of 1.5 to 2 higher .",
    "this has already been commented on by d05 , and is probably caused by systematic uncertainties in the assumed dust temperature and emissivity in s98 .",
    "ii ) there are very high extinction regions in the densest cores and within 1  of the galactic plane visible only in s98 .",
    "the isolated high extinction cores are probably superimposed point sources and/or regions with significantly different dust temperatures .",
    "the high @xmath0 region near the plane is partly caused by the same effect .",
    "additionally the far infrared map basically traces the entire emission from the galactic disk , while our technique has a limit of about 5 - 8kpc ( e.g. marshall et al .",
    ", froebrich & del burgo @xcite ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison of our map with the d05 maps is shown in fig.[dobcomp ] , were we plot the d05 @xmath0 values against ours .",
    "the figure contains data points from the 5@xmath65  region 2 ( serpens ) , whose coordinates are listed in table[sigmatab ] .",
    "note that we only plot a random selection of less than 1% of the data points from the entire area , to facilitate visibility .",
    "a one - to - one line , as well as a linear fit ( excluding outliers ) to the data points are overplotted .",
    "the parameters of the linear fit are listed in table[sigmatab ] for all regions .",
    "the individual comparison plots for all other regions listed in table[sigmatab ] are shown in appendix[ours_vs_dob ] .",
    "we see in fig.[dobcomp ] that d05 systematically underestimates the extinction by about 20% compared to our values .",
    "there is on the other hand no systematic offset , i.e. the linear fit has an offset of 0.17mag , well below the one sigma variance of our @xmath0 values . at high column densities ( above 5 - 6mag @xmath0 )",
    "there are very large differences between the two methods .",
    "these are caused by two effects : i ) as mentioned earlier , the optical star counting method of d05 is not able to trace these very high extinction regions ; ii ) our better spatial resolution allows us to pick up more small scale , high column density cores .    in general the plots for all regions ( appendix[ours_vs_dob ] )",
    "show a similar behaviour , i.e. a slight systematic underestimate of @xmath0 in d05 compared to our map and an offset below the variance of our data ( see table[sigmatab ] for the linear fit parameters ) .",
    "the fact that the offsets are below the variance level in our map , shows that our calibration of the colour excess values has worked properly at all positions .",
    "the only region tested where the offset is above the one sigma variance is lupus .",
    "an inspection of the actual plot ( fig.[comp_dob_our_reg3 ] ) , however , shows that a linear fit to the data is certainly not appropriate in this region .",
    "the large number of small scale high @xmath0 cores in the field ( see also lombardi et al . ) might cause the very different appearance of the plot .    with a few exceptions , the slope of the linear fits is about 1.2 ( see table[sigmatab ] ) .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this : i ) we have used an incorrect extinction law ; ii ) there are systematic uncertainties in the star count technique ;    there are two reasons why explanation i ) is unlikely to be the dominant cause for the discrepancy .",
    "firstly , we do not find any residuals resembling the giant molecular clouds when comparing the h - band extinction maps determined from @xmath19 and @xmath20 colour excess ( see fig.[sysres ] ) .",
    "such systematic differences should occur if we had used an incorrect extinction law .",
    "secondly , to explain the 20% difference , a value in excess of @xmath21=2.2 has to be used in the conversion of colour excess into extinction for all clouds .",
    "even if such values can be found in some clouds , generally a value of @xmath222.0 is found ( e.g. martin & whittet @xcite , drain ) .",
    "explanation ii ) seems to describe a more plausible cause for the 20% difference .",
    "the star counting technique from d05 counts the number of stars in a certain area . with an increasing distance of the cloud an increasing fraction of the stars",
    "are foreground .",
    "thus , the further away the cloud is , the more the extinction is underestimated by star counting .",
    "our _ median _ colour excess method on the other hand will either detect the correct colour excess of stars behind the cloud , or not detect the cloud at all ( see above ) .",
    "simulations of both extinction determination methods in froebrich & del burgo @xcite show this effect ( their fig.9 ) , and that its magnitude is in the order of 20% .",
    "we expect that with an increasing cloud distance the difference between our @xmath0 values and d05 increases . there is a tentative hint of that in the regions selected in table[sigmatab ] , but we will analyse this in more detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we also compare our @xmath0 values to those obtained in s98 for the same set of regions as above .",
    "as an example we show the comparison for region2 ( serpens ) in fig.[schcomp ] .",
    "all other individual plots are presented in appendix[ours_vs_sch ] .",
    "the parameters of the linear fits are also given in table[sigmatab ] .",
    "for the serpens region there seems to be a general offset of about 1.7mag @xmath0 between s98 and our map .",
    "there are , however , notable exceptions where either the s98 or our map indicates much larger extinction values .",
    "the causes for these are either our higher spatial resolution ( our @xmath0 higher than s98 ) or possibly groups of point sources not removed in the s98 maps ( in particular near the galactic plane ) in combination with the limitations of our method to pick up very high column density regions ( s98 @xmath0 values higher than ours ) . in general , we find that the s98 values overestimate the extinction by a factor of about 1.5 to 2.0 . this in in agreement with d05 , who found an overestimate of @xmath0 from s98 compared with their data by up to a factor of two .",
    "the offsets between the two extinction values are generally higher than our one sigma variance .",
    "the main reason for these differences are uncertainties in the dust temperature and emissivity , as well as the much larger line of sight in the s98 data . for details",
    "we refer to the discussion in d05 .    for completeness reasons",
    "we have also plotted the @xmath0 values of s98 against d05 in fig.[sch_vs_dob ] .",
    "the results of the linear fits are also listed in table[sigmatab ] .",
