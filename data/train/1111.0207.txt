    "on - line social networking sites such as facebook , flickr , linkedin , myspace , and twitter are examples of large - scale , complex , real - world networks , with an estimated total number of users that equals at least half of all internet users  @xcite .",
    "we may model an osn by a graph with nodes representing users and edges corresponding to friendship links . while osns gain increasing popularity among the general public",
    ", there is a parallel increase in interest in the cataloguing and modelling of their structure , function , and evolution .",
    "osns supply a vast and historically unprecedented record of large - scale human social interactions over time .",
    "the availability of large - scale social network data has led to numerous studies that revealed emergent topological properties of osns .",
    "for example , the recent study  @xcite crawled the entire twitter site , and studied properties found among the @xmath0 million user profiles and @xmath1 billion social relations .",
    "the next challenge is the design and rigorous analysis of models simulating these properties .",
    "graph models were successful in simulating properties of other complex networks such as the web graph ( see the books  @xcite for surveys of such models ) , and it is thus natural to propose models for osns .",
    "few rigorous models for osns have been posed and analyzed , and there is no universal consensus of which properties such models should simulate .",
    "notable recent models are those of kumar et al .",
    "@xcite , lattanzi and sivakumar  @xcite , and the iterated local transitivity model  @xcite .",
    "researchers are now in the enviable position of observing how osns evolve over time , and as such , network analysis and models of osns typically incorporate time as a parameter . while by no means exhaustive , some of the main observed properties of osns include the following .",
    "\\(i ) _ large - scale .",
    "_ osns are examples of complex networks with number nodes ( which we write as @xmath2 ) often in the millions ; further , some users have disproportionately high degrees .",
    "for example , some of the nodes of twitter corresponding to well - known celebrities have degree over five million .",
    "\\(ii ) _ small world property and shrinking distances . _",
    "the small world property , introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite , is a central notion in the study of complex networks ( see also  @xcite )",
    ". the small world property demands a low diameter of @xmath3 , and a higher clustering coefficient than found in a binomial random graph with the same number of nodes and same average degree .",
    "adamic et al .",
    "@xcite provided an early study of an osn at stanford university , and found that the network has the small world property .",
    "similar results were found in  @xcite which studied cyworld , myspace , and orkut , and in  @xcite which examined data collected from flickr , youtube , livejournal , and orkut .",
    "low diameter ( of @xmath4 ) and high clustering coefficient were reported in the twitter by both java et al .",
    "@xcite and kwak et al .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "@xcite reported that in flickr and yahoo!360 the diameter actually decreases over time .",
    "similar results were reported for cyworld in  @xcite .",
    "well - known models for complex networks such as preferential attachment or copying models have logarithmically growing diameters with time . various models ( see  @xcite ) were proposed simulating power law degree distributions and decreasing distances .",
    "\\(iii ) _ densification power law . _ a graph @xmath5 with @xmath6 edges and @xmath7 nodes satisfies a _ densification power law _ if there is a constant @xmath8 in @xmath9 such that @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the average degree grows to infinity with the order of the network . in @xcite ,",
    "densification power laws were reported in several real - world networks such as the physics citation graph and the internet graph at the level of autonomous systems .",
    "densification was reported in cyworld @xcite and has been detected in other osns .",
    "\\(iv ) _ power law degree distributions . _ in a graph @xmath5 of order @xmath11 let @xmath12 be the number of nodes of degree @xmath13 the degree distribution of @xmath5 follows a _ power law _",
    "if @xmath14 is proportional to @xmath15 for a fixed exponent @xmath16 power laws were observed over a decade ago in subgraphs sampled from the web graph , and are ubiquitous properties of complex networks ( see chapter  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "kumar , novak , and tomkins  @xcite studied the evolution of flickr and yahoo!360 , and found that these networks exhibit power - law degree distributions .",
    "power law degree distributions for both the in- and out - degree distributions were documented in flickr , youtube , livejournal , and orkut  @xcite , as well as in twitter  @xcite .",
    "\\(vi ) _ bad spectral expansion .",
    "_ social networks often organize into separate clusters in which the intra - cluster links are significantly higher than the number of inter - cluster links .",
    "in particular , social networks contain communities ( characteristic of social organization ) , where tightly knit groups correspond to the clusters  @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is reported in  @xcite that social networks , unlike other complex networks , possess bad spectral expansion properties realized by small gaps between the first and second eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices .",
    "our main contributions in the present work are twofold : to provide a model  the geo - protean ( geo - p ) model  which provably satisfies all six properties above ( see section  [ results ] ; note that , while the model does not generate graphs with shrinking distances , the parameters can be adjusted to give constant diameter ) , and second , to suggest a reverse engineering approach to osns .",
    "given only the link structure of osns , we ask whether it is possible to infer the hidden reality of such networks .",
    "can we group users with similar attributes from only the link structure ?",
    "for instance , a reasonable assumption is that out of the millions of users on a typical osn , if we could assign the users various attributes such as age , sex , religion , geography , and so on , then we should be able to identify individuals or at least small sets of users by their set of attributes .",
    "thus , if we can infer a set of identifying attributes for each node from the link structure , then we can use this in formation to recognize communities and understand connections between users .    characterizing users by a set of attributes leads naturally to a vector - based or geometric approach to osns . in geometric graph models ,",
    "nodes are identified with points in a metric space , and edges are introduced by probabilistic rules that depend on the proximity of the nodes in the space .",
    "we envision osns as embedded in a _ social space _ , whose dimensions quantify user traits such as interests or geography ; for instance , nodes representing users from the same city or in the same profession would likely be closer in social space . a first step in this direction",
    "was given in  @xcite , which introduced a rank - based model in an @xmath17-dimensional grid for social networks ( see also the notion of _ social distance _ provided in  @xcite ) .",
    "such an approach was taken in geometric preferential attachment models of flaxman et al .",
    "@xcite , and in the spa geometric model for the web graph  @xcite .",
    "the geo - protean model incorporates a geometric view of osns , and also exploits ranking to determine the link structure .",
    "higher ranked nodes are more likely to receive links",
    ". a formal description of the model is given in section  [ model ] .",
    "results on the model are summarized in section  [ results ] .",
    "we present a novel approach to osns by assigning them a dimension ; see the formula  ( [ mmm ] ) . given certain osn statistics ( order , power law exponent , average degree , and diameter )",
    ", we can assign each osn a dimension based on our model .",
    "the dimension of an osn may be roughly defined as the least integer @xmath17 such that we can accurately embed the osn in @xmath17-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "full proofs of our results are presented in section  [ proofs ] . in the final discussion , we summarize our findings and conjecture on the correct diameter for osns .",
    "we now present our model for osns , which is based on both the notions of embedding the nodes in a metric space ( geometric ) , and a link probability based on a ranking of the nodes ( protean ) .",
    "we identify the users of an osn with points in @xmath17-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "each node has a region of influence , and nodes may be joined with a certain probability if they land within each others region of influence .",
    "nodes are ranked by their popularity from @xmath18 to @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes , and @xmath18 is the highest ranked node .",
    "nodes that are ranked higher have larger regions of influence , and so are more likely to acquire links over time . for simplicity , we consider only undirected graphs .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath2 is fixed but the model is dynamic : at each time - step , a node is born and one dies .",
    "a static number of nodes is more representative of the reality of osns , as the number of users in an osn would typically have a maximum ( an absolute maximum arises from roughly the number of users on the internet , not counting multiple accounts ) . for a discussion of ranking models for complex networks , see  @xcite .",
    "we now formally define the geo - p model .",
    "the model produces a sequence @xmath19 of undirected graphs on @xmath2 nodes , where @xmath20 denotes time .",
    "we write @xmath21 there are four parameters : the _ attachment strength _",

    "the initialization and update of the ranking is done by _ random initial rank _ ( other ranking schemes may also be used .",

    "however , in order to get an upper bound , suppose the extreme case where the oldest vertex is ranked number one during its entire life . in such an extreme case , the degree would be @xmath238 _ wep _ which indicates that _ wep _ the maximum degree is at most @xmath238 .",
    "we now turn to the average degree .    by theorem  [ thm : labels_degree ]",
    "the average degree is @xmath239    the proof of theorem  [ powerlaw ] is now a simple consequence of theorem  [ thm : labels_degree ] .",

    "let @xmath243 be the largest value of @xmath211 such that @xmath244 ( note that @xmath245 , since @xmath246 . )",
    "thus , @xmath247 and the assertion follows from the chernoff bound , since @xmath246 and so @xmath248      we consider the upper and lower bounds in separate arguments .      the idea of the proof is to show that we can construct a connected subgraph of vertices spread out over the hypercube with a small diameter .",
    "this subgraph will act as a _",
    "backbone _ , and the next step in the proof shows that each vertex is connected to the backbone by a path of length at most 2",
    ".    we will fix values @xmath249 and @xmath250 $ ] to suit our needs later . to construct the backbone we partition the hypercube into @xmath251 subcubes , each of volume @xmath133 .",
    "consider all vertices with initial rank at most @xmath186 and age rank between @xmath252 and @xmath196 ; we will call such vertices _ eminent _ vertices .",
    "we now choose @xmath133 and @xmath186 such that _ wep _",
    "( @xmath211 ) the influence region of each eminent vertex contains the subcube in which it is located as well as all neighbouring subcubes , and ( @xmath253 ) each subcube contains at least @xmath254 eminent vertices .",
    "property ( @xmath211 ) will be achieved if the sphere of influence of each eminent vertex has size at least @xmath255 throughout the process .",
    "note that the sphere of influence of an eminent vertex initial has volume at least @xmath256 , and by lemmas  [ lemma : random_rank ] and  [ lemma : random_rank_bound ] _ wep _ it remains at least @xmath257 to the end of the process .",
    "we can thus achieve ( @xmath211 ) by choosing @xmath186 and @xmath133 such that the initial influence region is sufficiently larger than @xmath255  we choose @xmath258 .",
    "this leads to our first condition on @xmath186 and @xmath133 : @xmath259    it follows from the chernoff bound that , to guarantee that _ wep _ every subcube contains at least @xmath254 eminent vertices , it is sufficient to choose @xmath133 and @xmath186 so that the expected number of eminent vertices in a subcube is at least @xmath260 . since the initial rank is independent of age , the expected number of eminent vertices in a subcube equals @xmath261 .",
    "thus the following condition on @xmath133 and @xmath186 guarantees ( @xmath253 ) : @xmath262    combining  ( [ eq : first_eq ] ) and  ( [ eq : second_eq ] ) we find the following values for @xmath186 and @xmath133 : @xmath263    the set of all eminent vertices form the _ backbone_. since vertices in each subcube induce a random graph with a parameter @xmath57 ( constant , bounded away from zero ) , _ wep _ the induced subgraph is connected and of diameter of two .",
    "for any two neighbouring subcubes , the probability that there is no edge between them is equal to @xmath264",
    "so _ wep _ there is at least on edge connecting two neighbouring subcubes .",

    "note also that every vertex of age rank greater than @xmath196 in any subcube links to the backbone vertex in the same subcube with probability @xmath57 , since the sphere of influence of the backbone vertex includes all of the subcube .",
    "there are @xmath271 vertices of age rank greater than @xmath196 in @xmath267 , and a path of length 2 from @xmath47 to the backbone using that vertex exists with probability @xmath272 .",
