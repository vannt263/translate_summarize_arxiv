    "in iron - based superconductors ( fescs ) , it is very important to understand the electron correlation in different bands and the orbital selective mott transitions .",
    "as revealed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and band structure calculations , the superconductivity and normal state of fescs are governed by their electronic structure involving the fe 3d orbitals crossing the fermi energy@xcite . due to different structures and probably different methods for fabrication , the iron chalcogenide superconductors show up with different superconducting transition temperatures , for example , @xmath3 8 k for fe@xmath4se single crystals@xcite , @xmath3 16 k for fese@xmath4te@xmath0@xcite , @xmath3 32 k for k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a superconducting - like gaped feature can even be found in the monolayer thin film of fese / srtio@xmath5 at 65 k@xcite , this brings about new vitality in exploring high temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictide / chalcogenide systems .    in 2010 ,",
    "the discovery of the new k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor has generated great excitement in the community@xcite .",
    "previously , it was proposed that the pair - scattering of electrons between the hole and electron pockets might drive the electron pairing with an @xmath6 pairing symmetry@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 seems containing only electron pockets around the m - point , the hole pockets which appear in most feas based superconductors near the @xmath7-point are absent@xcite , which certainly leads to a challenge to explain the superconductivity by the nesting effect between the hole and electron pockets .",
    "later on , it is found that the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sample separates into two phases@xcite - a dominant antiferromagnetic insulating phase k@xmath2fe@xmath8se@xmath9@xcite , and a minority superconducting phase whose exact structure and compositions are still under debate@xcite .",
    "for the superconducting phase , it has been gradually conceived that the main structure is still the same as the typical bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , but both the fe and k may be deficient , and these deficiencies may form some kind of structures .",
    "recently , the neutron diffraction experiment indicates a potassium deficient but iron stoichiometric formula k@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 for the superconducting phase@xcite .",
    "therefore the study of such material is complicated by the nature of mesoscopic phase separation@xcite , and it is very challenging to explore the properties of the normal state of the superconducting phase .",
    "recently , yi _ et al_. reported the study of arpes on a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb ) single crystals , and proposed an orbital - selective mott transition in the normal state@xcite .",
    "moreover , femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite and thz spectroscopy@xcite studies also evidenced the mott - transition - like behavior in the normal state .",
    "these properties are consistent with the prediction of a multiband theory assuming strong on - site coulomb interactions@xcite . due to the reactivity of potassium element",
    ", the sample of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 is very sensitive in air , therefore , as far as we know , the hall effect has been seldom investigated in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "previous preliminary measurements reveal that the hall coefficient is negative over the whole temperature range , indicating that the system is dominated by electronic - like charge carriers@xcite , being consistent with the observation of the electron fermi pockets in the arpes measurements .    in this paper",
    ", we study the normal - state transport properties of quenched k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconducting single crystals with @xmath10 = 32 k through the in - plane resistivity , transverse magnetoresistance ( mr ) and hall effect measurements .",
    "we find that the kohler s rule is obeyed in the low temperature region .",
    "the hall coefficient has a strong but non - monotonic temperature dependence below 150 k. this is in contrast with the feas - based systems in which the hall coefficient shows a monotonic temperature dependence@xcite .",
    "these abnormal temperature - dependent behaviors can not be described by one single band model , suggesting the multi - band nature in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 . using a two - band model ( mainly @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) analysis ,",
    "we conclude that a gap may open below 65 k , while the non - monotonic temperature dependence of the hall coefficient could be understood as a consequence of an orbital - selective mott transition .",
    "these results would trigger further theoretical and experimental studies of the orbital selective correlation effect in fescs .",
    "fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystal with a broad hump appearing at @xmath13 240 k. a sharp superconducting transition is observed at about 32 k. an enlarged view near the superconducting transition is shown as an inset .",
    ", width=340 ]    fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "( a ) the mr below 80 k. solid lines are the fits as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the inset shows temperature dependence of mr measured at a magnetic field of 5 t. a pronounced minimum occurs at 80 k. the red line is a fit to the data below 80 k as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "( b ) the mr above 85 k plotted verse @xmath14.,width=340 ]",
    "the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals used for the transport measurements were fabricated by a self - flux method with a starting synthesizing composition of k : fe : se=0.8:2:2 .",
    "the crystals are rapidly quenched in liquid nitrogen after heating to 350 @xmath16c and staying for several hours .",
    "details of the preparation were described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the quenching process can greatly improve the connection of the tiny superconducting networks ( paths ) , and thus the global appearance of superconductivity is much better than the slowly cooled samples of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns ( xrd ) taken on the quenched crystals show only ( 00l ) peaks with some small accompanying peaks .",
    "we think that the main diffraction ( 00l ) peaks of the xrd pattern are coming from the major part of the sample , i.e. , the k@xmath2fe@xmath8se@xmath9 matrix , while the small accompanying peaks are coming from the minority superconducting networks . because there is clear evidence of phase separation in the sample , it is meaningless to claim an uniform composition through out the sample .",
    "the microanalysis using energy - dispersive - spectrum ( eds ) on the samples reveals that the background has a composition close to k : fe : se=2:4:5 .",
    "for the present quenched sample , since the minority superconducting phase ( path ) has very small size which is smaller than the size of the electron beam in the eds analysis , we could not use the eds technique directly to get valid values of compositions for the three elements@xcite .",
    "transport measurements were carried out with the six - lead method in a quantum design instrument physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the electric contacts were made using silver paste in a glove box filled with nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "we have worked on two samples from different batches and the results are similar to each other .    in the k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system ,",
    "one concern is the phase - separation property , the superconducting and insulating phases could both contribute in transport measurements . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , a broad hump with the peak at @xmath13 240 k is observed in the normal - state , being similar to those reported previously@xcite .",
    "this anomaly , being sensitive to the preparation process , could be caused by the connection in series between the metallic and the insulating phases as a result of the phase - separation picture . hence , we mainly focus on the normal - state properties below @xmath17 which are dominated by contributions from the metallic phase ( superconducting paths below @xmath10 ) . the small residual resistivity with sharp superconducting transition ( @xmath10 = 32 k ) indicates good connectivity of the superconducting paths .    in order to get more information of the normal - state properties ,",
    "further investigations are provided by the transverse mr and hall effect measurements on the same sample . in general , for most normal metals , the mr exhibits a @xmath14-dependence in the weak - field limit , and the mr normally affords a useful method to investigate the nature of electronic scattering . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we show the field dependence of the transverse mr , @xmath18 , below 80 k , solid lines are fits to @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the resistivity under zero magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the mr increases as @xmath14 in the sweeping magnetic field up to 5 t , signaling metallic behavior for _ t _ @xmath21 80 k , while the slight deviation at 35 k can be attributed to the superconducting fluctuations at a finite magnetic field .",
    "besides , there is a fundamental difference in the mr between _",
    "@xmath21 80 k and t @xmath22 85 k. in the latter , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the mr seems not follow the @xmath14-dependence , which indicates a transition of the electronic characteristics from one to another .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the temperature dependence of mr at 5 t , a clear minimum occurs at about 80 k and the mr below 80 k shows a nice fit to the @xmath15-dependence .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the crossover at around 80 k is consistent with the measurement of the finite - frequency dielectric function by means of terahertz spectroscopy in a rb - based sister compound@xcite .    the kohler s rule@xcite , which assumes a simple scaling function of @xmath23 , should be satisfied for a single band metal with an isotropic fermi surface , with @xmath20 the resistivity at a fixed temperature and zero field . for a multiband system , this rule is also applicable as long as the number of charge carriers from each band is independent on temperature and the scattering rates of different bands have the similar temperature dependence@xcite .",
    "from the first glance at the data below 60 k , as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , it seems that the kohler s rule is slightly violated . actually this slight `` deviation '' of kohler s rule may not be true .",
    "the reason is that the resistivity at zero field , namely @xmath24=@xmath25 does not really reflect directly the scattering rate @xmath26 when the residual resistivity is sizable .",
    "in addition , as argued below , there maybe a partial gap openning below 65 k , which may give an influence of the kohler s scaling rule . instead of using the original scaling function @xmath27 ,",
    "we use here a more accurate form of the kohler s scaling rule @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relaxation rate@xcite . since the system exhibits metallic properties in the low temperature region , we could assume the relaxation rate as @xmath30 .",
    "3(b ) shows the refined kohler s plot of @xmath31 vs @xmath32 .",
    "one can see that the kohler s rule is well obeyed below 80 k if we assume a general scattering rate @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the kohler s rule is drastically violated above 85 k , as shown with the enlarged view in the inset of fig .",
    "we now switch our attention to the temperature dependence of hall coefficient . in the present k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 system",
    ", hall effect measurements may provide the message concerning the temperature dependence of the charge carrier density and mobilities of electrons in different bands of the superconducting phase .",
    "since the insulating phase k@xmath2fe@xmath8se@xmath9 has the nearest band 300 mev below the fermi energy , they should not contribute in the hall effect measurements below t@xmath34 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , we show the hall resistivity @xmath35 versus magnetic field up to 5 t , a linear relation between @xmath35 and magnetic field @xmath36 has been found in wide temperature region ( 35 k to 150 k ) . from the @xmath37 data ,",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath38 is determined through @xmath39 and shown in fig .",
    "the negative @xmath38 over the whole temperature region up to 150 k reveals that the conduction is dominated by electron - like charge carriers .",
    "however , the most remarkable feature in fig .",
    "4(b ) is that the @xmath40 shows a strong but non - monotonic temperature dependence .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the feas - based 122 samples in which the hall coefficient is monotonically dependent on temperature@xcite . by having a closer scrutiny to the temperature dependence of hall coefficient , two characteristic temperatures",
    "could be defined : @xmath41 = 65 k and @xmath42 = 85 k. below 65 k , @xmath38 decreases rapidly with a suppression towards lower temperatures .",
    "this is quite similar to that in the feas - based superconductors . between 65 k and 85 k , @xmath38 is almost temperature",
    "independent , while it decreases upon raising temperature from 85 k to 150 k. this anomalous behavior has never been reported in previous studies in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and suggests that something beyond the multi - band physics is very important here in determining the electric conduction .",
    "at various denoted temperatures . inset shows the kohler s scaling of mr in low field region for selective temperatures .",
    "( b ) a refined kohler s plot below 80 k using @xmath28 and assuming @xmath43.,width=340 ]    , two characteristic temperatures could be defined : @xmath41 = 65 k and @xmath42 = 85 k. solid lines are theoretical curves using the two - band model ( see text).,width=340 ]    according to the band structure calculations and arpes studies , two sets of electronic orbitals near the fermi level , namely @xmath12 and @xmath11 play an important role .",
    "since the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are normally degenerate , we thus use a two band model to handle the issue . based on the boltzmann transport theory in the weak field limit",
    ", the equation of the hall coefficient for two - band model could be simplified as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are single band conductivity and hall coefficients for the two orbitals , respectively .",
    "based on the mr analysis , the system exhibits metallic state below 80 k and a @xmath15 temperature dependence was found in our data .",
    "thus , the mobility of the two orbitals are expressed generally as @xmath49 , @xmath50 is a parameter related to the effective density of states . since the kohler s rule is well obeyed below 80 k , concerning the fact that the recent thz spectroscopy experiments on rb@xmath4fe@xmath1se@xmath2 report a gap - like suppression of optical conductance below 61 k@xcite , we thus attribute the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient below 65 k to the temperature dependent of the charge carrier density . in this scenario",
    "we then define the carrier densities as @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a partial gap which opens at 65 k. the red line in fig .",
    "4(b ) presents excellent fitting results with the two - band model .",
    "one may suggest that the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient @xmath38 below 65 k is related to the different temperature dependence of the scattering rate @xmath54 , this however can not get support from other experiments , for example the arpes and optical data .",
    "after crossing a maximum , @xmath38 drops with increasing temperature above 85 k , which signals the involvement of a distinct electron scattering mechanism . this turning point and",
    "the change of the temperature dependence is consistent with the results of mr analysis .",
    "recently , an orbital - selective mott transition was observed by arpes at about 90 k in the superconducting phase of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , where the spectral weight near fermi surface for the @xmath12 orbital diminishes while the other orbitals @xmath11 remain metallic@xcite .",
    "moreover , investigations using pump - probe spectroscopy@xcite and thz spectroscopy@xcite also evidenced the mott - transition related behavior in the normal state . this scenario could give a reasonable explanation to our data here .",
    "since the @xmath11 orbital remains metallic , we still express the mobility of @xmath11 orbital as @xmath55 and the carrier density as a constant @xmath56 .",
    "meanwhile , we consider that the @xmath12 band goes into the mott phase with raising temperature . as it is well known , the mott insulating behavior has been experimentally identified and theoretically explained in terms of the band narrowing effect associated with the electron - electron correlation .",
    "therefore , the mobility of @xmath12 orbital could be interpolated with the formula @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the modification term associated with the mott transition . to approach a solution",
    ", we may set the carrier density of the @xmath12 orbital as a constant @xmath59 for simplicity .",
    "thus , the expression of the hall coefficient with the orbital - selective mott phase is written as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the relative ratio of the mobility coefficient of the two orbitals . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , the blue solid line above 85 k shows the theoretical fitting result .",
    "consequently , we acquire the parameters as @xmath53 = 7.7 mev , @xmath62 m@xmath63 , @xmath64 m@xmath63 , @xmath65 m@xmath63 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 = 0.001 k@xmath68 .",
    "the plateau of the hall coefficient r@xmath34 between 65 k and 85 k may be viewed as the crossover of the two different regions .",
    "we note that the appearance of a gap with the value of @xmath53 = 7.7 mev below 65 k could be compared to the observation of high - temperature superconductivity at 65 k in single - layer fese films@xcite .",
    "we also ca nt rule out the possibility of a pseudogap opening or other explanations for this gap - like suppression of @xmath38 below 65 k. the decrease of @xmath38 for increasing temperature starting from 85 k can get a strong support from the scenario of the orbital - selective mott transition in this system .",
    "the explanation based on the orbital selective mott transition should call for further theoretical and experimental efforts .",
    "in summary , magnetoresistance and hall coefficient @xmath38 have been measured in superconducting k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals .",
    "the kohler s rule is well obeyed below 80 k by assuming a general scattering rate @xmath69 .",
    "we have observed a strong and non - monotonic temperature dependence of the hall coefficient in the normal state . using a two - band model analysis and combining with the published data of the time domain optical conductivity measurements ,",
    "we conclude that a gap may open below 65 k , while the data above 85 k could be understood as a consequence of an orbital - selective mott transition of the @xmath12 band .",
