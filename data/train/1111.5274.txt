    "the theory of general relativity ( gr ) is currently the most commonly accepted theory describing space - time and gravitation .",
    "the theory has been accurately tested within the weak - field , stationary regime ( _ e.g. _  through solar system tests @xcite ) , and no deviations from gr have been conclusively found . however , by the very nature of gr , gravitation is a dynamical phenomenon , a key aspect being the prediction of gravitational waves ( gw ) @xcite .",
    "the first clue towards this dynamical aspect came with the discovery of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar @xcite .",
    "its orbital motion is in agreement with the assumption that gws carry away energy and angular momentum as predicted by gr .",
    "this test , as well as similar test performed on other binary pulsars that were subsequently discovered @xcite , however still involve indirect observations of gws .",
    "furthermore , even for the most relativistic binary pulsar that is currently known ( psr j0737 - 3039 ) , one has @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the total mass , and @xmath3 is the orbital separation ) and a typical orbital speed of @xmath4 . the observed binary pulsars are still very far from merger .",
    "however , given access to a sufficiently large volume of space , one should find compact binaries in the final stages of inspiral . at the nominal last stable orbit",
    ", these will have a separation of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the process of inspiral has been modelled in detail in the context of the so - called post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation ( _ cf_.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the direct detection of the gravitational wave signals from such binaries would enable us to probe the genuinely strong - field , dissipative dynamics of gr .",
    "compact binary systems that are close to merger are in fact among the primary targets for kilometer - sized interferometric detectors .",
    "these include the virgo detector in italy @xcite , the two ligo detectors in the united states @xcite and geo600 in germany @xcite .",
    "both virgo and ligo are in the process of being upgraded to advanced virgo and advanced ligo , which are expected to be completed around 2015 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an interferometer named kagra ( formerly know as lcgt ) in japan is in a planning stage @xcite , and a detector in india @xcite is also being considered . with the current estimates for the advanced detectors ,",
    "the rate of detection of inspiralling compact binaries is expected be around a few tens per year @xcite .",
    "quite a number of alternative theories to gr have been discussed in the literature , and the accuracy with which some of these could be probed with gravitational waves has been studied within the fisher matrix formalism ; for scalar - tensor theories , see @xcite , for a varying newton constant @xcite , for modified dispersion relation theories ( commonly referred to as ` massive gravity ' ) @xcite , for violations of the no hair theorem @xcite , for violations of cosmic censorship @xcite , and for parity violating theories @xcite .",
    "practical bayesian methods for performing tests of gr on actual gravitational wave data when they become available include the work by del pozzo _",
    "@xcite in the context of massive gravitons , that of cornish _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which employed the so - called parameterized post - einsteinian ( ppe ) waveform family @xcite , and that of gossan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which focussed on the ringdown signal .    a proposal by arun _",
    "@xcite is to measure various quantities within the phase and to check their consistency with the predictions of gr .",
    "this could lead to a very generic test , in that one would not be looking for particular ( classes of ) alternative theories . however , so far its viability was only explored through fisher matrix studies .",
    "inspired by the method of arun _ et al .",
    "_ , the authors of the present paper developed a new bayesian framework , with the following features @xcite :    * contrary to previous bayesian treatments such as @xcite , it addresses the question `` do _ one or more _ testing parameters characterizing deviations from gr differ from zero ? '' as opposed to `` do _ all _ of them differ from zero ? '' in practice this comes down to testing a number of auxiliary hypotheses , in each of which only a subset of the set of testing parameters is allowed to be non - zero ; * precisely because in most of the auxiliary hypotheses a smaller set of testing parameters is used , this method will be more suited to a scenario where most sources have low signal - to - noise ratio , as we expect to be the case with advanced ligo / virgo ; * as with most bayesian methods , information from multiple sources can easily be combined ; * the framework is not tied to any particular waveform family or even any particular part of the coalescence process . however , in @xcite we focussed on the inspiral part and chose the testing parameters to be shifts in the lower - order inspiral phase coefficients , as we will also do here .",
    "besides establishing a theoretical framework , @xcite also showed results for a few simple example deviations from gr .",
    "in particular , it was illustrated how the method can be sensitive to deviations which in principle can not be accomodated by the model waveforms .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to assume that the technique will be able to pick up _ generic _ deviations from gr , on condition that their effect on the phasing is of the same magnitude as that of a simple shift in one or more of the low - order phasing coefficients of the standard post - newtonian waveform .",
    "more precisely , as long as the change in the phase at frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is comparable to the effect of a shift of a few percent at @xmath8 beyond leading order ( corresponding to @xmath0 radians at @xmath9 hz ) , we expect the deviation from gr to be detectable by our method . in this paper , we will show some striking examples to provide further support for this claim .",
    "subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we recall the theory and the implementation of the method introduced in @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows results from simulations done with some specific examples of modifications to the waveform phase .",
    "a discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusion_discussion ] .",
    "at the heart of the method we proposed in @xcite lies the question `` to what degree do we believe gr is the correct theory describing the detected signals ? '' this question is best answered within the framework of bayesian model selection @xcite .",
    "the cornerstone of bayesian analysis is the comparison between the probabilities of two hypotheses given the available data .",
    "this is quantified by the _ odds ratio _",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 are the hypotheses of the models to be compared , @xmath12 represents the data and @xmath13 is the relevant background information . using bayes theorem , we can then write this odds ratio as @xmath14 the odds ratio is thus the product of two ingredients . the first factor is the ratio of the so - called _ evidences _ , @xmath15 , which is also known as the _ bayes factor_. the evidence ( also called the marginal likelihood ) for _ e.g. _ the hypothesis @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the parameters associated with the hypothesis @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the prior probability distribution of the parameters .    the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ oddsratio ] ) is the ratio of the prior probabilities , @xmath21 , and is often referred to as _",
    "prior odds_. it should be noted that the prior probability distribution is uniquely determined by the prior information",
    ".    the assignment of the prior probability will be further explained in subsection [ subsec : odds_ratio ] .",
    "details on the calculation of the bayes factor can be found in subsection [ subsec : implementation ] .      before moving on to define the odds ratio for the problem at hand ,",
    "let us explain the model waveforms used in this paper . in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescing systems ,",
    "the waveforms are accurately described by the post - newtonian approximation .",
    "this approximation describes important quantities such as the energy and the flux as expansions in powers of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the characteristic velocity of the binary system .    to illustrate our method we will use the analytic , frequency domain taylorf2 waveform model @xcite , which is implemented in the ligo algorithms library in the following way @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance , @xmath26 the sky position in the detector frame , and @xmath27 the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the direction to the line of sight .",
    "@xmath28 is the so - called chirp mass , and @xmath29 is the symmetric mass ratio ; in terms of the component masses @xmath30 one has @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the phase @xmath33 takes the form @xmath34\\,f^{(i-5)/3 } ,      \\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36 the time and phase at coalescence , respectively .",
    "central to the method are the phase coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 . these either have a functional dependence on @xmath39 as predicted by gr ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite for the explicit expressions ) , or are allowed to deviate from the value predicted by gr . in eq .",
    "( [ taylorf2 ] ) , the ` frequency sweep ' @xmath40 is itself an expansion in powers of the frequency @xmath41 with mass - dependent coefficients . note that @xmath42 is related to the phase @xmath43 and we could in principle allow it to deviate from the gr prediction .",
    "however , for stellar mass binaries and with advanced detectors , we do not expect to be particularly sensitive to sub - dominant contributions to the amplitude @xcite , so we will keep the function @xmath44 fixed to its gr expression .    we note that in the case of binary neutron stars , which are the sources we will in fact focus on , taylorf2 waveforms are likely to already suffice for a first test of gr .",
    "indeed , in the relevant mass range , taylorf2 has a match and fitting factor close to unity with effective one - body waveforms modified for optimal agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "spins are unlikely to be very important in this case",
    ". one might worry about finite size effects , but as shown in @xcite , even for the most extreme neutron star equations of state and for sources as close as 100 mpc , advanced detectors will not be sensitive to these at frequencies below @xmath45 hz ; hence one could cut off the recovery waveforms at 400 hz , in which case the loss in snr would be less than a percent .",
    "however , if one also wanted to test gr using systems composed of a neutron star and a black hole , or two black holes , then dynamical spins @xcite , sub - dominant signal harmonics @xcite and merger / ringdown @xcite would become important , and in that case more sophisticated waveform models will be called for .",
    "the latter is currently the subject of investigation .      focussing our attention on deviations from gr in the phase of the measured waveform , _",
    "i.e. _ keeping the amplitude fixed to its gr - predicted value , we consider within the bayesian model selection framework the following two hypotheses :    * @xmath46 : the waveform has a phase with the functional dependence on @xmath39 as predicted by gr ; * @xmath47 : one or more of the phase coefficients do not have the functional dependence on @xmath39 as predicted by gr .",
    "the gr hypothesis , @xmath46 , is the hypothesis that our gr waveform model ( taylorf2 in this case ) correctly describes the signal originating from the inspiral of two compact objects .",
    "ideally , @xmath47 would simply have been the negation of @xmath46 . however , _ a priori _ , deviations from gr can occur an infinite number of ways .",
    "what we will argue is that for the core question that we want to address , _ i.e. _ whether or not the observed phase deviates from gr , it will be sufficient to allow for a _ limited _ set of possible deviations in the recovery waveforms . for taylorf2",
    ", we take the set of deviations only to be within the known phase coefficients @xmath48 .    to date , the taylorf2 phase has ten known phase coefficients ( @xmath49 , and two additional coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 associated with logarithmic contributions ) . here",
    "we will not use @xmath52 as a variable coefficient ; even so , if one were to consider all the subsets of the set of remaining coefficients , one would have to take into account @xmath53 ways in which a deviation can occur .",
    "apart from this being computationally demanding , we do not expect to be sensitive to the highest - order coefficients ; hence it makes sense to limit oneself to all the subsets of @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of phase coefficients one chooses to consider .",
    "we thus allow one or more of the coefficients @xmath56 to vary freely , instead of following the functional dependence on @xmath57 as predicted by gr .",
    "the choice of @xmath55 will be in part be influenced by the required generality of the test , measurability of phase coefficients , and computational limitations .",
    "finally , we quantify our belief in whether one or more phase coefficients deviate from gr by means of auxiliary hypotheses @xmath58 , which are defined as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath58 is the hypothesis that the phasing coefficients @xmath59 do not have the functional dependence on @xmath60 as predicted by general relativity , but all other coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 _ do _ have the dependence as in gr .",

    "although the detection rate for compact binary coalescences is still rather uncertain , we expect advanced instruments to detect several events per year  @xcite .",

    ".      from a theoretical point of view , the data favours the hypothesis @xmath47 compared to the hypothesis @xmath46 when @xmath85 . the relative degree of belief in the two hypotheses is encapsulated in the magnitude of the odds ratio",
    "however , in the case of advanced ground - based detectors , the signals will be buried deep inside the noise .",
    "this introduces the problem that the noise itself can mimic the effect of a deviation from gr that is non - negligible .",
    "hence we need to study the effect of noise on the odds ratio . for this purpose",
    ", we constructed a so - called _ background _ , _ i.e. _ a distribution of log odds ratios from a large number of catalogues , collectively denoted by @xmath86 , of simulated signals consistent with @xmath87 and embedded within noise .",
    "the background distribution @xmath88 of log odds ratios for catalogues of gr sources can be seen as the blue dotted histogram in the right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dphia2_histograms ] below .    in the advanced detector era",
    ", one will only have access to a single catalogue of detected _ foreground _ events .",
    "the associated measured log odds ratio should subsequently be compared with the background distribution in order to quantify our belief in a deviation from gr .",
    "to do this , in sec .",
    "[ subsec : catalogue_size ] we will introduce a maximum tolerable false alarm probability @xmath89 , which together with the background distribution sets a threshold @xmath90 for the measured log odds ratio to overcome .    for specific examples of gr violations",
    ", we will want to know how likely it is that the catalogue of foreground sources will have an odds ratio that is above threshold .",
    "for this reason we will also simulate large numbers of foreground catalogues , collectively denoted by @xmath91 . for a given false alarm rate @xmath89 , one",
    "can then calculate what fraction of the simulated foreground catalogues has a log odds ratio above the associated threshold @xmath92 ; this fraction we will call the _",
    "efficiency_.      a few remarks have to be made regarding the implementation of the aforementioned method .",
    "first , we use @xmath93 testing parameters @xmath94 .",
    "the varying of these phase coefficients was parameterised in the following fashion : @xmath95 ,      \\label{eq : deltapsi}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 the functional form of the dependence of @xmath37 on @xmath60 according to gr , and the dimensionless @xmath97 is a fractional shift in @xmath37 .",
    "the 0.5pn case , @xmath98 , however can not be implemented in a similar way , as gr predicts @xmath99 .",
    "instead , deviations from @xmath100 are modelled as @xmath101 and the interpretation of a fractional shift is not adequate ; rather , @xmath102 is related to the magnitude of the deviation itself .",
    "for the computation of the odds ratio defined in eq .   and",
    "eq . , one needs to compute the relevant bayes factors via the evidences . in high - dimensional problems , brute force methods to calculate the integral in eq .",
    "are computationally too expensive .",
    "one can , however , make use of more efficient methods to make this calculation computationally feasible . in this paper , we resort to an algorithm called nested sampling @xcite . more specifically , an implementation tailored to ground - based observations of coalescing binaries by veitch and vecchio @xcite was used .",
    "both the model waveforms and the nested sampling algorithm were appropriately adapted from existing code in the ligo algorithms library @xcite .",
    "in this section , we want to lend further support to the claim in @xcite that the method is in principle sensitive to deviations that are not considered within the model waveforms , as long as the phase shift at @xmath103 hz , where the detectors are the most sensitive , is comparable to , say , a shift of @xmath104 at 1.5pn order ( corresponding to a shift in the overall phase of @xmath0 radians at the given frequency ) . to this end",
    "we use two heuristic examples where the change in phase of the signals can not be accomodated by the model waveforms , yet the deviation from gr turns out to be detectable .    the first example , in subsection [ subsec : mass_dep_freq_power ] , considers an additional term in the phase associated with a power of frequency which _ itself _ depends on the total mass of the system .",
    "this power is chosen in such a way that within the range of total masses we consider , the frequency dependence of the anomalous contribution varies from effectively being 0.5pn at the lower end to 1.5pn at the higher end .",
    "clearly , our model waveforms are in no way designed to capture such a deviation from gr .",
    "the second case , in subsection [ subsec : quadratic_curvature ] , considers a deviation at a pn order ( 2pn ) that is higher than the orders at which we allow phase coefficients to vary in our model waveforms ( 0.5pn , 1pn , and 1.5pn ) .    after presenting the main results",
    ", we study the effects of the number of detected sources on our confidence in a deviation from gr .",
    "for this investigation we use the example in subsection [ subsec : quadratic_curvature ] .    from fisher matrix analyses , it has been shown that the phase coefficients in eq .",
    "are best measured as the total mass of the system goes down @xcite .",
    "therefore , the signals were chosen to originate from neutron stars with masses between @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "for such systems , it has been shown that contributions from the spin interactions and the sub - dominant signal harmonics are negligible , and merger / ringdown do not have a significant impact @xcite .",
    "the aim is to simulate the situation at advanced virgo and ligo as realistically as possible .",
    "we have assumed an advanced detector network with detectors at hanford and livingston , both with the advanced ligo noise curve @xcite , and a detector at cascina with the advanced virgo noise curve @xcite .",
    "three data streams were produced , containing stationary , gaussian noise coloured by these respective noise curves , to which simulated signals were added .",
    "events were placed uniformly in volume ( _ i.e. _ probability density proportional to @xmath107 , where @xmath25 is the luminosity distance ) , between @xmath108 mpc and @xmath109 mpc , to reflect the estimates of the number of detectable sources and the appropriate horizon distance . a lower cut - off of 8 was imposed on the _ network _ snr , defined as the quadrature sum of the individual detector snrs , so as to be consistent with the ligo / virgo minimum for an event to be claimed as detected .",
    "the waveforms were chosen to go up to 2pn in phase both for the injected signals and the model waveforms .",
    "the test coefficients were taken to be @xmath98 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , so that the hypothesis @xmath47 contains @xmath112 logically disjoint sub - hypotheses .",
    "the priors given to the deviations @xmath113 were chosen to be flat and centered around zero , with a total width of @xmath114 .",
    "the priors on the remaining parameters were taken to be the same as in @xcite , with the exception that the distance is allowed to go up to @xmath115 mpc .",
    "it should be stressed that the choice of waveform approximant , test coefficients , and priors on the deviations were , to a large extent , arbitrary . in the advanced detector era , one would seek to perform the most general test that computational resources will allow .",
    "this will include the most accurate waveforms available at that time , the highest number of test coefficients one can handle , and the least restrictive priors that are in accordance with our prior information at that moment .",
    "in our first example , the signals are given a deviation in the phase that has a mass dependent frequency power .",
    "specifically , the deviation is of the form :    @xmath116    where @xmath2 denotes the total mass of the binary system .",
    "we note that for a system with component masses in the middle of our range , @xmath117 , the change in phase at @xmath9 hz is about the same as for a 10% shift in @xmath111 .",
    "more precisely , for these masses the change in @xmath118 is 13.3 radians , to be compared with the 12.8 radians change induced by a constant 10% shift in @xmath111 .    in order to assess the statistics of the odds ratio , a large number or signals",
    "were simulated , with the parameter distribution explained above .",
    "for each of the signals , we calculated the odds ratio as defined in eq . .",
    "the distribution of the odds ratio as a function of snr can be seen in fig .",

    "the differentiation becomes significant.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we have seen in the previous section that constructing the odds ratio from a catalogue of sources greatly increases the confidence in a deviation from gr .",
    "however , the rates of binary inspiral observed in the advanced detector era are highly uncertain .",
    "it is therefore instructive to study the effect of the catalogue size on our confidence in detecting a deviation .    to characterise such a confidence",
    ", we introduce the concept of _ efficiency_. assume one has two distributions of log odds ratios : the _ background distribution _ of log odds ratio obtained when the simulated catalogues , collectively denoted by @xmath86 , are in agreement with @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and the _ foreground distribution _ obtained when the simulated catalogues @xmath91 adhere to some alternative theory , @xmath128 .",
    "now choose a maximum tolerable _ false alarm probability _ @xmath89 .",
    "this sets a threshold @xmath92 for the measured log odds ratio to overcome , as follows : @xmath129 we now define the _ efficiency _ , @xmath130 , as the fraction of foreground with a false alarm probability of @xmath89 or less , _ i.e. _ the portion that lies above the threshold @xmath92 : @xmath131 the efficiency can be viewed as the chance that if there is a deviation from gr corresponding to @xmath132 , the catalogue of sources that is actually detected will have a log odds ratio above threshold , _",
    "i.e. _ that it will have a false alarm probability of @xmath89 or less . note that with these definitions , the efficiency is independent of the overall prior odds ratio @xmath74 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : totalignorance ] ) and ( [ eq : oddscombined ] ) , as it corresponds to the same shift of @xmath133 in the background distribution , the threshold @xmath92 , and the foreground distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_catsize ] , we show the efficiency @xmath130 for the example shown in subsection [ subsec : quadratic_curvature ] as a function of the catalogue size , for @xmath134 . which sources are placed together in a catalogue is determined randomly . to understand the statistical fluctuations in the efficiency when collecting sources into catalogues in different ways , for the same set of signals we considered 5000 random orderings in which the signals are combined into catalogues .",
    "the resulting median and the 68@xmath135 confidence levels are shown as the central curve and the error bars , respectively .",
    "( @xmath136 ) .",
    "5000 random orderings of the same set of sources were split into catalogues .",
    "the mean ( central curve ) and the 68@xmath135 confidence intervals ( error bars ) are plotted .",
    "the efficiency rises sharply as a function of the number of sources , underscoring the importance of coherently considering all detected signals events . ]    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_catsize ] , the acceptance probability rises sharply as a function of the catalogue size .",
    "this underscores the importance of considering all the detected source in a coherent fashion , as was explained in subsection [ subsec : multiple_sources ] . even though a single detection might not yield confidence in a deviation from gr , coherently adding information from multiple sources",
    "can rapidly increase this confidence .    to put the numbers in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_catsize ] into perspective , the predicted rate for binary inspiral in the so - called ` realistic ' case is 40 per year @xcite .",
    "we have given two striking examples to support the claim that our method proposed in @xcite can distinguish deviations that are not captured by the limited model waveforms , as long as the phase shift in the frequency range where the detectors are the most sensitive ( @xmath103 hz ) is comparable to one caused by a shift of at least @xmath104 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 radians .    in the first example",
    ", signals were studied that have a deviation in the phase with a mass dependent power of frequency , effectively ranging from 0.5pn to 1.5pn as the total mass is varied from the lowest to the highest value we consider .",
    "the magnitude of the effect was such that at @xmath9 hz , the change in phase ( @xmath137 radians ) was about the same as that induced by a constant relative shift @xmath138 .",
    "the odds ratio for individual sources already showed confidence that such deviations can be measured .",
    "when sources were combined into catalogues of 15 each , the confidence in having detected a deviation improved drastically , and a deviation of this kind will be measurable with a false alarm probability of essentially zero .",
    "we further showed results for signals with a shift in the 2pn phase coefficient , @xmath139 . setting @xmath140 ,",
    "the induced change in phase at @xmath9 hz is comparable to a constant shift @xmath141 at 1.5pn , namely 4.5 radians .",
    "the choice of a modification at 2pn was inspired by corrections to the phase if one considers a modified einstein - hilbert action containing terms that are quadratic in the riemann tensor , as calculated in @xcite . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_catsize ] , the efficiency for a maximum false alarm probability of 1% is essentially unity for catalogues comprising more than 25 sources .",
    "lastly , we investigated the effect of the catalogue size on our confidence in detecting a deviation .",
    "in general , this confidence rises sharply with the number of sources in the catalogue , underscoring the necessity to combine information from multiple sources in the advanced detector era .",
    "finally , we want to mention some necessary future developments .",
    "first and foremost , the most accurate waveforms will need to be incorporated in order to distinguish between genuine effects predicted by gr , and possible deviations from gr . especially for systems consisting of two black holes , or a neutron star and a black hole",
    ", these waveforms will need to include dynamical spins , sub - dominant signal harmonics , residual eccentricity , a description of the merger and ringdown , _ etc_. the development of waveforms including these effects is ongoing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effects of realistic detector noise , instead of idealised stationary , gaussian noise , need to be studied in detail .",
    "once the advanced detectors have reached their design sensitivities and a number of detections have been made ( _ e.g. _ using template - based searches @xcite ) , a test of general relativity using compact binary coalescences could go as follows .",
    "starting from the best available gr waveforms , one introduces parameterised deformations in phase as well as in amplitude , leading to disjoint hypotheses @xmath58 , the logical ` or ' of all of which is @xmath142 .",
    "next , many injections are performed of gr waveforms into real or realistic data and collected into ` catalogues ' to establish a background distribution for the log odds ratio @xmath143 , and a suitable threshold @xmath92 is set below which a deviation from gr will not be accepted .",
    "then @xmath143 is computed for the catalogue of sources that were actually detected .",
    "if this number is above threshold , a violation of gr is likely .    the number of testing parameters one can consider will be limited , mainly by the computational restrictions one will have in the advanced detector era .",
    "our method is meant , first and foremost , to establish whether or not a violation of gr is plausible , _ of whichever kind _ and _ not _ mainly to pinpoint the eventual alternative theory of gravity responsible for the gw signal , nor to estimate the parameters of the alternative model , as it is unlikely that low - snr signals as those expected for the advanced stage of ligo / virgo will enable a detection of a gr deviation _ and _ an identification of its nature .",
    "however , once a deviation is found , a follow - up investigation can be performed with our inference method in an attempt to find out its precise nature by trying different alternatives to gr , _",
    "i.e. _ using waveforms inspired by specific ( families of ) alternative theories of gravity .",
    "a version of the so - called parameterised post - einsteinian waveform family @xcite could be useful in this respect . in this",
    "regard we recall that our framework is not tied to any particular waveform family .    the results of @xcite , and the further investigations presented here , motivate the construction of a full data analysis pipeline based on the method we have presented .",
    "although much work remains to be done on the data analysis side , the advanced detectors will enable us to go well beyond the tests performed using the observed binary pulsars , and give us our very first empirical access to the genuinely strong - field dynamics of space - time .",

    "<S> the framework is well - adapted to a scenario where most sources have low signal - to - noise ratio , and information from multiple sources as seen in multiple detectors can readily be combined . in our previous work </S>",
    "<S> , we conjectured that this framework can detect _ generic _ deviations from gr that can in principle not be accomodated by our model waveforms , on condition that the change in phase near frequencies where the detectors are the most sensitive is comparable to that induced by simple shifts in the lower - order phase coefficients of more than a few percent ( @xmath0 radians at 150 hz ) . </S>",
    "<S> to further support this claim , we perform additional numerical experiments in gaussian and stationary noise according to the expected advanced ligo / virgo noise curves , and coherently injecting signals into the network whose phasing differs structurally from the predictions of gr , but with the magnitude of the deviation still being small . </S>",
