    "it is well known that a superstrong magnetic field of order @xmath5 gauss , typically found on the surfaces of neutron stars , can dramatically change the structure of neutral atoms and other bound states ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for an early review and ref.@xcite for a recent text on atoms in strong magnetic fields ) .",

    "we focus on the hydrogen atom , but discuss those aspects which are important for application to molecules in very strong fields ( we shall study molecular excitation levels in a later paper@xcite ) .    a free electron confined to the ground landau level , the usual case for @xmath8 , does not move perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "such motion is necessarily accompanied by landau excitations .",
    "when the electron ( still in the landau ground state ) combines with a proton , the mobility of the neutral atom across the field depends on the ratio of the atomic excitation energy and the landau excitation energy @xmath12 for the proton .",
    "as the typical coulomb excitation is @xmath13 in atomic units , it is convenient to define a critical field strength @xmath14 via b_critb_crit=1.8010 ^ 4 ;   b_crit = b_critb_o=4.2310 ^ 13  g. for @xmath15 ( terrestrial conditions ) the landau energies of both electron and proton are minor perturbations and one can construct wave packets that mimic the classical motion of a neutral atom across the field . in this case the internal structure of the atom or molecule is coupled to the center - of - mass motion only through a `` motional stark effect '' ( see sec .",

    "to set the scene , we briefly review the pseudomomentum approach to the two - body problem of a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field@xcite .",
