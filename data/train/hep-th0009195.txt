    "magnetic monopoles arise as topological defects in theories which undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking . in general ,",
    "magnetic monopoles exist if the mapping of the vacuum manifold , associated with the symmetry breaking , onto the two - sphere is non - trivial .",
    "the existence of magnetic monopoles is consequently a generic prediction of grand unification .",
    "if magnetic monopoles were indeed present in the universe , they would have a host of astrophysical and cosmological consequences .",
    "here we consider magnetic monopoles @xcite and multimonopoles @xcite in su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory , with the higgs field in the triplet representation .",
    "these solutions are globally regular .",
    "since their magnetic charge is proportional to their topological charge , the regular monopole and multimonopole solutions reside in topologically non - trivial sectors of the theory . in contrast , the monopole - antimonopole pair solutions @xcite are topologically trivial .    in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit",
    "@xcite , where the strength of the higgs self - interaction potential vanishes , the mass of the monopole and multimonopole solutions saturates its lower bound , the bogomolnyi bound . in particular , the mass _ per unit charge _ of an @xmath2 monopole is precisely equal to that of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "there is no interaction between the monopoles in the bps limit , because the spatial components of the stress tensor vanish @xcite .",
    "the higgs field is massless and mediates a long range attractive force which exactly cancels the long range repulsive magnetic force of the @xmath3 field @xcite .    for finite higgs selfcoupling , however , the higgs field is massive and therefore decays exponentially .",
    "consequently the long range magnetic field dominates at large distances , leading to the repulsion of like monopoles @xcite .",
    "in particular , as verified numerically for @xmath4 and @xmath5 monopoles @xcite , the mass _ per unit charge _ of an @xmath2 monopole is higher than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "thus for finite higgs selfcoupling there is only a repulsive phase between like monopoles .",
    "let us now consider the effect of gravity on the monopole solutions .",
    "when gravity is coupled to ymh theory , a branch of gravitating @xmath1 monopole solutions emerges smoothly from the flat space monopole solution @xcite .",
    "the branch extends up to some maximal value of the gravitational strength , beyond which the size of the monopole core would be smaller than the schwarzschild radius of the solution @xcite . along the branch with",
    "increasing gravitational strength , the mass of the gravitating monopole solutions decreases monotonically .",
    "finally a degenerate horizon forms @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the presence of gravity a branch of gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair ( map ) solutions emerges from the flat space map solution @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we investigate how gravity affects the static axially symmetric multimonopole solutions of su(2 ) ymh theory @xcite and whether the inclusion of gravity allows for an attractive phase of like monopoles .",
    "for a given topological charge @xmath0 , we find a branch of globally regular and asymptotically flat multimonopole solutions , emerging smoothly from the corresponding flat space solution , and extending up to some maximal value of the gravitational strength . along the branch",
    "the mass of the solutions decreases monotonically . and , indeed",
    ", we find a region of parameter space , where the mass _ per unit charge _ of the gravitating multimonopole solutions is lower than the mass of the gravitating @xmath1 monopole . here",
    "the multimonopole solutions are gravitationally bound .",
    "thus gravity allows for an attractive phase of like monopoles , not present in flat space .",
    "we consider su(2 ) eymh theory with action @xmath6 with newton s constant @xmath7 , yang - mills coupling constant @xmath8 , and higgs self - coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "in flat space su(2 ) ymh possesses multimonopole solutions with axial symmetry for any topological number @xcite . for topological number @xmath10 ,",
    "solutions with less symmetry exist @xcite . here",
    "we extend the axially symmetric multimonopole solutions to curved space .",
    "we choose isotropic coordinates with metric @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are only functions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the ansatz for the purely magnetic gauge field is @xcite @xmath17 \\ , \\label{gf1}\\ ] ] and for the higgs field the ansatz is @xcite @xmath18 the symbols @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the dot products of the cartesian vector of pauli matrices , @xmath22 , with the spatial unit vectors @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the winding number @xmath0 represents the topological charge of the solutions .",
    "the four gauge field functions @xmath24 and the two higgs field function @xmath25 depend only on the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for @xmath1 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the spherically symmetric ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite is recovered .",
    "we fix the residual gauge degree of freedom @xcite by choosing the gauge condition @xmath29 @xcite .    for asymptotically flat magnetically charged solutions the boundary conditions at infinity are @xmath30 requiring the solutions to be regular at the origin ( @xmath31 )",
    "leads to the boundary conditions @xmath32 the boundary conditions along the @xmath33- and @xmath34-axis are determined by the symmetries of the solutions . on both axes the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and the derivatives @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 have to vanish .    introducing the dimensionless",
    "coordinate @xmath44 and the higgs field @xmath45 , the equations depend only on two coupling constants , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48    the mass @xmath49 of the multimonopole solutions can be obtained directly from the total energy - momentum `` tensor '' @xmath50 of matter and gravitation , @xmath51 @xcite , or equivalently from @xmath52 , yielding the dimensionless mass @xmath53 .",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the equations numerically @xcite .",
    "we start from the flat space ( multi)monopole solutions @xcite and increase @xmath46",
    ". then branches of gravitating ( multi)monopole solutions extend up to maximal values of @xmath46 , @xmath54 , which increase with increasing topological charge and decrease with increasing strength of the higgs selfcoupling .",
    "as the globally regular ( multi)monopole solutions approach the critical value of @xmath46 , a degenerate horizon starts to form @xcite .",
    "indeed , the exterior of the critical solution corresponds to the exterior of an extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole with magnetic charge @xmath0 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the metric function @xmath12 of the gravitating @xmath4 multimonopoles in the bps limit for several values of @xmath46 .",
    "with increasing @xmath46 the function @xmath12 decreases monotonically and approaches the metric function @xmath55 of the extremal rn solution with magnetic charge @xmath4 . at @xmath56 ,",
    "its value at the origin is already very small , close to the value @xmath57 , representing the degenerate horizon of the extremal rn solution .",
    "also , the angle - dependence of the metric function is seen to diminish and disappear , as the critical value of @xmath46 is approached . likewise , the higgs field function @xmath58 , shown in fig .  2 , approaches the value @xmath59 of the rn solution @xcite .",
    "the higgs field function @xmath60 and the gauge field functions approach their respective rn values as well . satisfying israel s theorem , the rn solution is spherically symmetric .",
    "the mass _ per unit charge _ of the ( multi)monopole solutions decreases with increasing @xmath46 . in the bps limit , for @xmath61",
    "the mass _ per unit charge _ is precisely equal to the mass of the @xmath1 monopole . for @xmath62 , however , we observe that the mass _ per unit charge _ of the multimonopoles is smaller than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "in particular , the mass _ per unit charge",
    "_ decreases with increasing @xmath0 . the mass _ per unit charge _ of @xmath4 and 3 multimonopoles in the bps limit is shown in fig .",
    "3 . thus in the bps limit",
    ", there is an attractive phase between like monopoles , not present in flat space .",
    "moreover , multimonopoles exist for gravitational coupling strength , too large for @xmath1 monopoles to exist .    for finite higgs selfcoupling ,",
    "the flat space multimonopoles have higher mass _ per unit charge _ than the @xmath1 monopole , allowing only for a repulsive phase between like monopoles . by continuity",
    ", this repulsive phase persists in the presence of gravity for small values of @xmath46 , but it can give way to an attractive phase for larger values of @xmath46 .",
    "thus the repulsion between like monopoles can be overcome for small higgs selfcoupling by sufficiently strong gravitational attraction . at the equilibrium value @xmath63 , multimonopole mass _ per unit",
    "und monopole mass equal one another .",
    "we show the equilibrium value @xmath63 in fig",
    "@xmath63 increases with increasing higgs selfcoupling , yielding a decreasing region in parameter space for the attractive phase . finally , for large higgs selfcoupling , only a repulsive phase is left .    while singly charged monopole solutions are stable , stability of the static axially symmetric multimonopole solutions is not obvious .",
    "we conjecture , that the @xmath4 multimonopole solutions are stable , as long as their mass _ per unit charge _ is lower than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole . for topological number @xmath10 , however , solutions with only discrete symmetry exist in flat space @xcite , which , by continuity , should also be present in curved space ( at least for small gravitational strength ) . for",
    "a given topological number @xmath64 , such multimonopole solutions without rotational symmetry may possess a lower mass than the corresponding axially symmetric solutions .",
    "the axially symmetric solutions may therefore not represent global minima in their respective topological sectors , even if their mass _ per unit charge _ is lower than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "besides embedded abelian black hole solutions , like e.g.  the magnetically charged rn solutions encountered above , su(2 ) eymh theory also possesses genuine non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the su(2 ) eymh black hole solutions then are no longer uniquely determined by their mass and charge ( for vanishing angular momentum ) .",
    "the non - abelian black hole solutions , considered as black holes within ( multi)monopoles , therefore represent counterexamples to the `` no - hair '' theorem @xcite .",
    "while static spherically symmetric ( @xmath1 ) eymh black holes were studied in much detail @xcite , non - abelian black hole solutions with magnetic charge @xmath2 were previously only obtained perturbatively @xcite . replacing the boundary conditions at the origin ( [ bc2a ] ) by the appropriate set of boundary conditions at some horizon radius @xmath65 @xcite , we obtain static axially symmetric black hole solutions with magnetic charge @xmath2 numerically @xcite .",
    "these black hole solutions are asymptotically flat , as required by the boundary conditions at infinity ( [ bc1a ] ) , and they possess a regular deformed horizon @xcite .",
    "being static and not spherically symmetric , these black hole solutions represent new counterexamples to israel s theorem .",
    "while previous ( non - perturbative ) counterexamples @xcite to israel s theorem are not classically stable , black holes within multimonopoles should provide classically stable counterexamples @xcite .",
    "finally we note , that the gravitational properties of monopole spacetimes near the black hole threshold , lend themselves to obtain new insight on the laws of black hole thermodynamics @xcite . also , insight concerning the cosmic censorship hypothesis",
    "might be obtained from the static black hole solutions without spherical symmetry @xcite .",
