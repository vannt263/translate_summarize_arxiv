    "flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays are forbidden at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they can proceed through loop processes  an example is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyndiag ]  at a considerably suppressed rate .",
    "the modes under study have additional helicity and gim suppression , and have sm branching fractions beyond the reach of current experiments .",
    "the largest predicted branching fraction is about @xmath4 for the decay @xmath5 , the others being more than an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "a primary interest in these modes is as probes of new physics ( np ) .",
    "np can enter either at tree level , or through loop processes , and can increase the branching fraction by orders of magnitude .",
    "these modes provide the best limits on a number of np scenarios .    lepton - flavor violating ( lfv )",
    "decays are strictly forbidden in the sm , so observation is a clear sign of np .",
    "( the lfv in neutrino oscillations plays an insignificant role in the decays studied here . )",
    "cdf searched for the decays @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 .",
    "( inclusion of change conjugate modes is assumed throughout . )",
    "the searches share many features .",
    "the search is performed relative to a normalization mode chosen for its similarity to the search mode .",
    "this avoids the difficulty of determining absolute efficiencies , and largely cancels many systematics .",
    "the selection criteria for the search mode are optimized in an unbiased manner , with the events in the search window blinded .",
    "a monte carlo with a detailed detector simulation is used to simulate signal events .",
    "background is estimated from sideband data , data before lepton identification , and monte carlo when appropriate .",
    "the production , acceptance , and reconstruction efficiency of the search mode are determined relative to the normalization mode . with the selection optimized , the data is unblinded .",
    "none of the investigated decays showed a significant signal after unblinding , so branching fraction limits are determined , for example , as :    @xmath6    where the superscript @xmath7 indicates that the corresponding quantity is a credibility level limit , @xmath8 is the number of decays observed to final state @xmath9 , the ratio of @xmath10 s is the ratio of acceptance and efficiency between the search and normalization final states , @xmath11 is the branching fraction of @xmath12 to final state @xmath9 , and , because the search mode is for @xmath13 while the normalization mode is for @xmath14 , the ratio of fragmentation fractions @xmath15 is needed .",
    "equation  [ eq : limits ] is for @xmath16 , and the obvious substitutions yield the expressions for the other modes .    in the following section we present some of the specific challenges of each analysis ,",
    "then summarize the results and discuss limits on np that can be derived .",
    "the @xmath0 analysis for @xmath17 of integrated lumninosity is published @xcite and will be omitted in this proceeding in the interest of devoting more space to the unpublished results .",
    "the limits are displayed in table  [ limits ] .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays are normalized to the charmless @xmath20 decay @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath21 decays is extracted from data collected by a two - track , separated vertex trigger ( ttt ) from @xmath17 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this trigger selects events with two oppositely charged tracks with transverse momenta above @xmath22 , impact parameters between @xmath23 and @xmath24 to the beam spot , and a transverse decay length greater than @xmath25 .",
    "the decays @xmath26 reconstructed from the trigger track - pairs are indistinguishable in the invariant mass plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mpipi ] ) , and are separated on a statistical basis as described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 decays are extracted from this same data by reconstructing the trigger track - pairs as either @xmath29 or @xmath30 and then requiring the tracks be matched to hits in the muon detectors , or to an energy cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "additional background suppression for electrons is provided by requiring an ionization energy loss , @xmath31 , in the outer tracker inconsistent with hadrons . for electrons ,",
    "bremstrahlung in the detector can result in significant energy loss producing a tail in the reconstructed invariant mass distribution . to maintain good acceptance ,",
    "a generous search window is used , @xmath32 around the nominal @xmath13 or @xmath14 mass for the @xmath27 modes , and @xmath33 for the @xmath28 modes .",
    "the backgrounds are primarily combinatorial and from misidentified @xmath34 decays .",
    "the unblinded mass plots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beeemumass ] ) reveal two events in the @xmath35 and @xmath30 mass windows , one event in the @xmath36 and @xmath30 mass windows .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 bayesian credibility level limits determined for these modes is displayed in table  [ limits ] .",
    "the @xmath2 search is normalized to the cabibbo suppressed @xmath39 decay @xcite .",
    "two body @xmath40 decays are reconstructed from the trigger tracks in events selected by the ttt from @xmath41 of integrated luminosity .",
    "combinatorial background to the normalization and search channels is greatly reduced by requiring an associated pion from the decay chain @xmath42 .",
    "the small mass difference between pions and muons leads to invariant mass distributions that overlap significantly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmmmass ] .",
    "we identify a track as a muon based on hits in either the central muon detector ( cmu ) or the muon extension ( cmx ) , as determined by projecting the track from the central outer tracker to the muon detectors .",
    "a careful study of background sources revealed that a significant background exists from pairs of real muons coming from the sequential decay chain @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this background is suppressed using a likelihood ratio based on decay length , decay length significance , and impact parameter of the candidate @xmath40 to the primary vertex .    when the data is unblinded we observe three central - central events , zero central - extension events , and one extension - extension event , consistent with the background estimate .",
    "the derived @xmath37 and @xmath38 bayesian credibility limits are displayed in table  [ limits ] .",
    "the limits from these analyses are displayed in table  [ limits ] , along with the previous best published limit and the experiment that produced it . from these limits",
    "we derive limits on np models .",
    "the @xmath5 limit is used to restrict the allowed parameter space for supersymmetry models .",
    "the @xmath18 limits have been used to derive mass limits on pati - salam leptoquarks @xcite ( fig .",
