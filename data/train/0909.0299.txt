    "a model of fundamental importance in quantum optics and essential in any description of systems involving the interaction between matter and light is given by the hamiltonian proposed by dicke  @xcite .",
    "this describes the interaction of n - identical two - level systems with a single mode radiation field in the dipole approximation ; the particles are confined in a container small compared to the radiation wavelength .",
    "the simplest completely soluble quantum - mechanical model of one atom in an electromagnetic field is described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model  @xcite . in this model the hamiltonian terms which do not conserve the energy of the field plus the occupation number of the two - level system",
    "have been neglected because their contributions are very small except for very high intensity fields  @xcite , which has been called the _ rotating - wave approximation_.    since the end of the sixties , the exact solution for an n - molecule ",
    "radiation field hamiltonian was obtained  @xcite , and a full family of exactly solvable generalizations has been presented recently  @xcite .",
    "they have provided insight into other more complicated physical systems and offers a standard comparison for approximation techniques .",
    "presently , the jc model and its generalization given by tavis and cummings , the _ tavis - cummings _ ( tc ) model , continue to be fundamental to study basic properties of quantum electrodynamics and to understand phenomena like the existence of collapse and revivals in the rabi oscillations  @xcite , the formation of macroscopic quantum states , and the many experimental studies of rydberg atoms with very large principal quantum number within single - mode cavities  @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that it was not until 1987 that the collapse and revival predicted by the jc model was experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "instabilities , or quantum phase transitions , in these models have recently been studied due to their influence on several kinds of entanglement , important in quantum information theory .",
    "lambert et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the atom - field entanglement in the thermodynamic limit , finding logarithmic divergences in the atom - field entanglement and discontinuities in the average linear entropy .",
    "buek et al .",
    "@xcite showed that an infinite sequence of instabilities appear in the ground state of the dicke model when the rotating - wave approximation is taken , characterized by changes in the bipartite entanglement between atoms .",
    "similar models have been used to describe the phase transitions of @xmath0 identical qubits interacting with a bosonic mode in an adiabatic approximation  @xcite .",
    "although there have been recent contributions to the quantum phase transitions in the dicke model and its extensions  @xcite , we want to enhance the role of the catastrophe formalism to determine when significant changes to the ground state occur for small changes of the external environment ( the parameters of the model ) . according to sachdev  @xcite ,",
    "if a system undergoes a ground state energy phase transition at @xmath1 as a function of external parameters , then it also has a thermodynamic phase transition for fixed interaction parameters as a function of the increasing temperature .    quantum phase transitions and stability properties of algebraic models",
    "have been studied through the catastrophe formalism and the coherent states theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , a procedure was established to determine the phase transitions associated to nuclear and matter models  @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we present a comprehensive study of the phase transitions of the ground state in the tc model , for any number of atoms , when the strength of the interaction @xmath2 and the atom hyperfine two - level separation energy @xmath3 are varied .",
    "these quantum transitions occur also for a small number of particles , although we can take the thermodynamic limit and corroborate the results obtained at the beginning of the 70 s  @xcite .",
    "the minima of the expectation value of the hamiltonian are calculated for a trial state , built as a coherent state @xmath4 .",
    "employing the catastrophe formalism , the separatrix is found .",
    "the structure of the ground state of the system changes when this separatrix , given by @xmath5 , is crossed , in agreement with the phase transition found by hepp and lieb  @xcite .",
    "these parabolae divide the control parameter space in three regions which map naturally onto the bloch sphere , where minima of the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to the coherent trial state are attained : ( 1 ) the north pole , where the ground state of the system is constituted by all the atoms lying in the low hyperfine level and the electromagnetic field has zero photons ; ( 2 ) the south pole , with the ground state formed by all the atoms in the excited hyperfine level and zero photons in the electromagnetic field ; and ( 3 ) the parallel region , where the ground state has a variable number of components ( field + matter ) , ranging from one , for values of the interaction strength close to the arms of the parabolae , to @xmath6 , for the collective regime . by means of ehrenfest s thermodynamic classification of phase transitions",
    "we have determined that for the tc model there are second order phase transitions when the separatrix is crossed through the arms of the parabolae , and first order transitions when the crossing happens through their vertices .",
    "we also explore the influence of the phase transitions on the behaviour of observables of interest for the matter and the field : the population and dipole moments of the two level atoms , together with the expectation value of the number of photons and its fluctuations .",
    "we evaluate the squeezing and entanglement properties of the ground state in the different regions of the control parameter space . in order to compare the reduced probability distribution of the excited number of atoms , obtained by the exact quantum result , with that determined using the semi - classical approximation , the fidelity between them is calculated .",
    "finally , the photon number distribution of the ground state as a function of the atom - field coupling parameter @xmath2 is given .",
    "by _ semiclassical analysis _ it is meant here the following procedure : i ) calculation of the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to the tensorial product of coherent states ( _ trial state _ ) ; ii ) determination of the minimal critical points ; and iii ) use of the catastrophe formalism to find the stability properties .",
    "the use of coherent states as trial states lets us determine in analytical form the expectation values of matter and field observables .",
    "we are interested in solving the tc hamiltonian given by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath0 is the number of particles in the system , @xmath8 is the field frequency , @xmath9 the atomic energy - level difference , and @xmath10 the field - atom interaction strength .",
    "it is immediate that this hamiltonian commutes with the operator @xmath11 it is then convenient to rewrite it by introducing a detunning parameter @xmath12 , and by dividing it by @xmath13 ( which can be thought of as the natural unit of frequency ) and by the total number of particles , having in this way an intensive hamiltonian operator @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in order to obtain an energy surface we use as a trial state the direct product of coherent states in each subspace : heisenberg - weyl for the photon part  @xcite and @xmath17 or spin for the particle part  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "explicitly , it is given by the expression @xmath19 where the ket @xmath20 is an eigenstate of the photon number operator , @xmath21 is a dicke state with @xmath22 denoting the eigenvalue of @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath25 .",
    "the trial state contains @xmath0 particles and up to an infinite number of photons distributed into all the possible ways between the two levels .",
    "the expectation value of the tc hamiltonian ( @xcite ) in this trial state is defined as the energy surface given by @xmath26 to get this expression we have substituted @xmath27 where @xmath28 correspond to the expectation values of the quadratures of the field and @xmath29 determine a point on the bloch sphere . the function @xmath30 is the expectation value of the constant of motion @xmath31 , and is given by @xmath32 the eigenvalue @xmath22 is related to the number of molecules or atoms present in the two - level system , and it can take the values @xmath33  @xcite , according to the symmetry of the particles . if we are interested in the symmetric configuration , the so called superradiance regime  @xcite , we have to consider @xmath34 , which will be assumed hereafter .    the critical points of the energy surface are obtained by equating its first derivatives to zero . the derivatives with respect to @xmath35 and",

    "one can check that the hessian matrix has rank 3 at the critical points .",
    "this means that the energy surfaces at the critical points are independent of @xmath38 and we shall say the energy surface is @xmath38-unstable .    we thus obtain the following critical points : the north pole ( @xmath43 ) , the south pole ( @xmath44 ) , and a parallel defined by @xmath45 .",
    "we determine the nature of the critical points examining the hessian matrix of the energy surface at the critical points . because the variable @xmath38 is spurious",
    ", we have the liberty to choose its value ( which in general we will take to be zero ) .",
    "we can recover the values of quantities dependent on @xmath38 , at any @xmath38 , by applying the transformation @xmath46 .    in the north pole ( @xmath47 )",
    "the hessian matrix has the three eigenvalues @xmath48 for @xmath49 we have a minimum ( all three eigenvalues positive ) ; for @xmath50 we obtain a degenerate critical point ; and for @xmath51 we get a saddle point ( one eigenvalue is always negative ) . along @xmath52 , the hessian matrix is singular and thus it is a bifurcation set of the system  @xcite .    in the south pole ( @xmath53 ) the hessian matrix has eigenvalues @xmath54 here",
    ", for @xmath55 we have a minimum ; for @xmath56 we obtain a degenerate critical point ; and for @xmath57 we get a saddle point .",
    "the matrix is singular along @xmath56 , which is then another bifurcation set .",

    "the phase transitions for the states of mimimum energy occur at the separatrix @xmath66 , as we have seen .",
    "it can be shown that crossing the arms of the parabolae , such as along the circuit @xmath82 in fig.([separa ] ) , leads to second order phase transitions ; in this case the composition of the ground state changes from only one component @xmath83 at the north pole to many components at the parallels region , or from one component @xmath84 at the south pole to many at the parallels , and viceversa .",
    "figure ( [ contourii ] ) below shows contour maps for @xmath85 just before and after the crossing at @xmath86 along path ii .",
    "the crossing at the vertex @xmath87 along a non - zero slope , such as path v in fig.([separa ] ) , is a first order phase transition .",
    "the minimum energy state switches from all the atoms in their ground state and zero photons in the field ( north pole ) , to all the atoms in their hyperfine excited state and zero photons in the field ( south pole ) .",
    "this transition involves a change in sign for @xmath41 , which may be achieved by continuously varying a magnetic field to which the atoms in the cavity are exposed .",
    "the energy surface @xmath88 changes abruptly through this vertex , as expected , and it is shown in fig.([contourv ] ) .      as mentioned in section a , the trial state is a tensor product of the coherent states of the one mode electromagnetic field times the collective atomic state .",

    "the dispersion @xmath232 has values ten times smaller .",
    "the expectation value @xmath94 of the photon number operator per number of atoms with respect to the ground state is shown in fig.([nfoton ] ) , for the exact and variational quantum results , for a system of @xmath220 atoms with a detuning @xmath189 .",
    "the fluctuation in the number of photons @xmath233 is also shown . note that in the north pole , @xmath223 , the number of photons is zero .",
    "thus , the fluctuation _ must _ be zero and completely coincide with its semiclassical counterpart . outside this region , the proposed trial function as a coherent state for the description of the electromagnetic field , which includes an infinite number of photons in its composition , greatly overestimates the quantum result : for @xmath234 there is approximately one photon per atom with very good agreement between the two procedures , while their corresponding fluctuations have at least a difference of a factor of six .",
    "we have found that the ground state of the tc model does not present the phenomenon of squeezing in the matter components .",
    "however we propose to use the behaviour of the squeezing spin coefficient @xmath216 as an additional signature of the goodness of our trial state in reproducing the exact quantum solution .",
    "we can see in fig.([sqe ] ) that the squeezing coefficient exceeds the value of one for large values of the coupling parameter .",
    "this means that the trial state must have a very small overlap with the exact quantum state , and it is due to the multiple values of the constant of motion contained in the composition of our trial state .    the entanglement is usually regarded as a purely quantum correlation which plays an important role in quantum phase transitions  @xcite . for the variational state the entanglement entropy between",
    "the matter and field is zero because it corresponds to a pure state ( matter coherent state ) .",
    "it is then interesting to do a comparison with the entanglement between atoms in the semi - classical approach .",
    "fig.([sqe ] ) shows the entanglement entropy associated to the variational and exact quantum cases , for a reduced density matrix that eliminates the electromagnetic degrees of freedom and discriminates the matter part into the atoms occupying the lowest hyperfine level from the rest , and viceversa .",
    "once again , the semiclassical result is a very good approximation to the exact one .",
    "the plots shown are for @xmath220 and @xmath189 .",
    "it is clear that for any @xmath235 ( i.e. , outside @xmath236 ) there is entanglement between the atoms . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath185 ,",
    "the behavior is the same with an even more abrupt slope at the separatrix . besides",
    ", one can notice directly from this plot , that the entanglement entropy with @xmath234 is @xmath237 nats ; this compares favorably with a straightforward estimate of the maximum entanglement entropy available for a quantum system of @xmath188 , which would yield @xmath238 nats .",
    "an interesting measure , coming from quantum information theory , is the fidelity @xmath239  @xcite , where @xmath240 denotes the density matrix of a system .",
    "this is a measure of how close two probability distributions are to each other , even for mixed states . in the case of two pure states ,",
    "the measure is equivalent to the overlap . in our case ,",
    "we want to compare the reduced probability distributions calculated from the exact model and from the variational model . since they are both diagonal ( cf .",
    "eqs.([rhoc ] , [ rhoq ] ) ) , the expression for the fidelity is simple : @xmath241    fig.([fidelity ] ) shows the fidelity as a function of @xmath2 both in resonance @xmath187 , and away from resonance @xmath189 , for the probability distributions mentioned above . at the north pole ( zero photons and all atoms in the ground state , @xmath242 ) the fidelity represents the overlap between the two states , and equals @xmath78 .",
    "each jump represents a value of @xmath30 increased by @xmath78 .",
    "the first and largest transition is found at the separatrix , while the other discontinuities occur at the quantum phase transitions .",
    "note that @xmath243 diminishes at each of these for small values of @xmath30 ( small number of photons ) .",
    "in all these cases we have mixed states .",
    "after @xmath244 ( number of photons equal to the number of atoms ) the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix remains constant and @xmath243 increases at each transition ( except for the anomalous case @xmath245 ) .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that the fidelity is high and the probability distribution of the coherent state approximates very well the exact solution , especially for a small number of atoms and a large number of photons .",
    "the composition of the ground state of the tc model can be analyzed both , in terms of the distribution of the atoms into the two hyperfine levels , and of the photon number content , be it for the exact energy ground state or for its variational approximation .",
    "fig.([ocprob ] ) shows the composition of the trial and exact states for @xmath220 , @xmath189 .",
    "the four plots show the change in the occupation probability as one crosses one arm of the separatrix : in this case , we move along @xmath246 in fig.([separa ] ) and cross the separatrix at @xmath247 from the parallels region into the north pole ( recall that @xmath189 )",
    ". the marked change due to the phase transition is obvious .",
    "while the composition of the ground state in both cases are very similar , one has to notice that the variational state is constituted by a distribution of @xmath30 s in contrast to the exact quantum result which is described by only one @xmath30-value .",
    "( this good approximation is a consequence of the fact that the distribution of @xmath30 s is a gaussian centered at the quantum eigenvalue , as will be seen below in fig.([lams ] ) and its corresponding discussion . )",
    "this quantum @xmath30-value depends of the coupling parameter @xmath2 considered in the tc hamiltonian as can be seen in fig.([energy ] ) .",
    "it is important to stress that , for values of @xmath2 far away from the separatrix ( @xmath248 in the figure ) , the semiclassical occupation probability estimates very well the quantum result .",
    "the estimate is even better as @xmath0 increases , until they become almost indistinguishable , as shown in fig.([ocprob50 ] ) calculated for @xmath221 . however , as we get close to the separatrix ( @xmath247 for @xmath220 ; @xmath86 for @xmath221 ) the semiclassical approximation gets poorer .",
    "when we cross it , both distributions become a spike at @xmath249 , and they remain so until the separatrix is crossed again . the distributions",
    "are exactly the same changing @xmath2 for @xmath250 ( cf .",
    "fig.([ocprob50 ] ) ) .    to calculate the distribution of the @xmath30 values for",
    "the trial state one can use the coefficients  ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "fig.([lams ] ) shows the obtained distribution for @xmath251 , @xmath220 , and @xmath189 .",
    "notice that there are approximately six different values of @xmath30 with significative values in the probability distribution .",
    "the maximum is centered between @xmath252 and @xmath253 ; adjusting a gaussian distribution we get a mean @xmath254 and a standard deviation @xmath255 . for reference ,",
    "the exact diagonalization gives @xmath256 for this value of @xmath2 . while only values of @xmath30 up to 10 were considered in this chart , these amount to 99.979% of the total contribution .",
    "this is the main reason why the tensorial product of coherent states constitutes a good approximation to the quantum ground state .    in order to explain the good approximation of the trial state in all the studied observables except for the fluctuations in the number of photons",
    ", one can study the way in which the number of photons is distributed in the ground state for each quantum eigenvalue @xmath30 . from our analysis on fidelity ( cf .",
    "fig.([fidelity ] ) ) , we expect the distributions for the variational state and the quantum state to agree inside the north pole and away from the separatrix , but to show a strong disagreement at the separatrix itself . this is exactly what fig.([traslapes ] ) shows , where , starting at the minimum value @xmath257 , corresponding to @xmath258 ( just inside the north pole ) , we increase @xmath30 in steps of @xmath78 , crossing the separatrix and reaching a value away from it at @xmath259 , corresponding to @xmath260 .",
    "we see that , even though the photon number distribution of the trial state is wider than the quantum case , the mean is the same .",
    "the top of fig.([traslapes2 ] ) , for @xmath261 and @xmath262 ( corresponding to @xmath263 ) , shows this more clearly . considering the contribution to the photon number probability distribution given by only the @xmath30 value of the exact quantum solution",
    ", we obtain the narrow , darker bars in figs.([traslapes ] , [ traslapes2 ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes are necessary smaller since we have eliminated all contributions from other @xmath30 values : for instance , with @xmath261 and @xmath262 the contribution of the values of @xmath148 to the state is of only @xmath264 .",
    "however , a proper renormalization renders this distribution practically equal to that of the corresponding quantum photon number distribution , as illustrated in fig.([traslapes2 ] ) ( bottom ) .",
    "a comprehensive study of the ground state quantum phase transitions in the tavis - cummings model , for any number of atoms , has been presented as a function of the strength of the interaction @xmath2 and the atom hyperfine two - level separation energy @xmath3 .",
    "the minima of the expectation value of the hamiltonian were calculated for a coherent trial state , the separatrix that divides the control parameter space was found , and the structure of the ground state of the system in all these regions was studied .",
    "first and second order phase transitions were determined as the separatrix is crossed , and their influence on the behaviour of observables of interest for the matter and the field were explored . these include the population and dipole moments of the two level atoms , the expectation value of the number of photons and its fluctuations , and the squeezing and entanglement properties of the ground state .",
    "additional quantum phase transitions of the ground state of the model , due to the discreteness of the value of the constant of motion @xmath265 , disappear when the number of atoms grows to infinity .",
    "however , the expectation values of the field and matter observables , together with the entanglement entropy , are manifestly discrete even for a very large number of atoms .    a discrete behaviour in the expectation value of the constant of motion @xmath31 at which the minimum energy is obtained , reflecting the quantum nature of the system ,",
    "was shown : as the matter - field coupling is increased , the value of @xmath219 remains constant until a threshold is reached , at which point it jumps to its next value .",
    "the discrete behaviour is inherited in all other quantum observables of interest .",
    "since the value of observables remain constant over small regions of the interaction parameter , this feature can be used for control and manipulation of quantum systems of small number of atoms , where non - demolition experiments could be carried out .",
    "it was also found that when the detuning parameter is taken away from resonance , the @xmath219 steps ( and those of other observables ) acquire a slope given precisely by the difference in energy between the absorbed photons and the atom s energy level separation .",
    "the effect of the detuning is of an even greater importance , as it modifies expectation values of interest such as the number of photons , the entanglement entropy , and the dipole moments .",
    "our calculations show that these increase as @xmath12 decreases , and viceversa .",
    "thus , one could fine - tune the entanglement entropy @xmath266 between atoms , for instance , through a fine - tuning of @xmath12 .",
    "while their semiclassical counterparts show , in contrast , a continuous behaviour , we have shown that they are an excellent approximation to the exact ( quantum ) values in all the calculated observables , with the exception of the photon number fluctuation .",
    "the reason for this is found in the fact that the proposed trial function , as a coherent state for the description of the electromagnetic field , includes an infinite number of photons in its composition , greatly overestimating the quantum result .",
    "this results in the trial state having a very small overlap with the exact quantum state , which may also be seen in the squeezing coefficient , as it exceeds the value of one for large values of the coupling parameter ( cf .",
    "fig.([sqe ] ) ) . in reality",
    ", the variational state has a gaussian distribution of @xmath267 around the quantum value of the constant of motion . in the case of @xmath220",
    "the standard deviation of this distribution is @xmath268 , implying that significant contributions will be had only for a small number of occupation states , or equivalently , from a small number of fock states .",
    "a better trial state may be constructed by truncating the proposed state to only one value of @xmath30 , which can be chosen to be in agreement with that of the quantum solution , and by renormalizing the state .",
    "when this is done , we have found an excellent agreement between this renormalized trial state and the quantum result ( cf .",
    "fig.([traslapes2 ] ) ) .",
    "the calculation of the expected values of other observables , using the renormalized state , is undergoing .",
    "the composition of the ground state was shown in terms of the distribution of the atoms into the two hyperfine levels , both for the exact energy ground state and for its variational approximation .",
    "we showed that away from the separatrix the semiclassical occupation probability estimates very well the quantum result .",
    "the estimate is even better as the number of atoms @xmath0 increases , until they become indistinguishable .",
    "however , as we get close to the separatrix the semiclassical approximation gets poorer .",
    "the fidelity of the reduced probability distributions of the atoms populating the excited hyperfine level is calculated for the semiclassical and exact ground states , which gives information about the overlap in the region where a pure state dominates , i.e. , @xmath269 . outside this region",
    "we obtain information about the similarity between two mixed density matrices .",
    "this fidelity can also be fine - tuned through @xmath12 ."
