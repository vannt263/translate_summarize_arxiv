    "among the different kinds of astrophysical star conglomerates , globular clusters ( gc ) have a very peculiar status .",
    "first , as we go down the mass - scale of observed structures , from super clusters through galaxies down to dwarf spheroidals , they are the first objects whose dynamics can be understood without resorting to the presence of dark matter .",
    "second , and this may be related to the first point , they are the only star clusters dense enough for a statistical equilibrium to be reached in a hubble timescale . the dark matter content of globular clusters may be an important clue to the understanding of the formation of our galaxy .",
    "however , the observational situation is not very clear yet as regards stellar counts and the related direct detection of a hidden population of light and faint stars . since the claim by richer and fahlman that the mass function steeply rises towards low masses in some gcs ( fahlman et al .",
    "1989 , richer et al .",
    "1991 ) , the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has been used to measure the mass function in several globular clusters , and the opposite conclusion was reached ( demarchi and paresce 1995 , elson et al .",
    "1995 , paresce , de marchi and romaniello 1995 ) .",
    "part of the discrepancy is due to the conversion scheme used to translate the measured luminosity functions into mass functions .",
    "there is actually no consensus on the mass - to - luminosity relation of low - mass objects . in a recent investigation , santiago et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a steadily increasing mass function for , using hst observations .",
    "this suggests that the dark matter content may depend on the cluster .",
    "it seems therefore important to fully understand what we can also learn from other types of measurement , such as in particular the brightness and the velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "there is a widespread belief that globular clusters can not contain large amounts of dark matter , because of the virial theorem .",
    "the latter relates the velocity dispersion @xmath0 at the center of the cluster to the total mass @xmath1 and to the half - mass radius @xmath2 of the system . for a one - component globular cluster",
    ", that relation may be expressed as ( spitzer 1987 ) : @xmath3 however , if a dark component is also present , in the form of low - mass objects for example , the virial theorem must be modified to @xmath4 where the index @xmath5 refers to the different stellar species , and where @xmath6 is the potential energy of the cluster . in previous papers ( taillet et al .",
    "1995 and 1996 ) focusing on isotropic globular clusters , we showed that in the presence of dark matter , relation ( [ viriel ] ) still holds for the visible component , and that most of the visible properties of the cluster are approximately the same as for a one - component system .",
    "in particular , the brightness profile is nearly unchanged even if dark matter is abundant .",
    "this is due to the phenomenon of mass segregation .",
    "because of gravitational interactions , stars tend to share their kinetic energy .",
    "thus , the light objects gain velocity from the heavier stars , which sink to the center of the cluster , while the light objects have a much more diffuse distribution .",
    "the heavier stars then form a self - gravitating system in the low - density background of the light objects , and their properties are not significantly altered .",
    "it was concluded that even a dark - matter dominated cluster looks very much the same as a dark - matter free system , and that the point of the dark matter content could not be made by the mere observation of the brightness profile .",
    "it was also noted that the presence of dark matter would be betrayed by the velocity dispersion profile of bright stars which flattens when dark matter is present .",
    "however , those profiles need to be accurately measured , which is not yet the case .",
    "the results of our analysis were obtained for king models where the stellar distribution is isotropic in velocity space .",
    "their validity must be reassessed when the velocity distribution is no longer isotropic .",
    "anisotropy is likely to be present at some level because stars mainly interact in the cluster core .",
    "at least part of those orbiting at the outskirts of the system gained the required energy by interacting at the center .",
    "then , orbits should be predominantly radial at large radii . in that respect , note that for which the hst observations provide a steadily rising mass function may also have an anisotropic velocity distribution ( meylan 1987 ) , even though an isotropic distribution is not excluded ( merrit et al .",
    "such a cluster may be modeled by a michie distribution in phase space , where an angular - momentum exponential cut - off is applied to a king distribution ( see section  2 ) .",
    "it is well known that when anistropy is present , the velocity dispersion profile is less flat .",
    "thus we suspect that the flattening of the velocity dispersion profile that occurs in the presence of dark matter will be partially cancelled by the effect of anisotropy . a given velocity dispersion profile",
    "could therefore be interpreted either with a one - component isotropic gc or with a two - component anisotropic gc .",
    "however , anisotropy may also affect a priori the brightness profile .",
    "the main goal of this paper is therefore to make these statements more quantitative .",
    "we will investigate how anisotropy affects the detectability of dark matter in globular clusters . in section  2 , we present a new analytic form for the equation that relates the gravitational potential to the stellar mass densities .",
    "the michie distribution is expressed with the usual error function and dawson s integral .",
    "section  3 is devoted to our set of two - component michie models whose heavy component is kept fixed while the abundance in low - mass stars is varied .",
    "various velocity anisotropies are explored .",
    "finally , the surface brightness and the velocity dispersion profiles of these models are discussed in section  4 and conclusions are drawn .",
    "a michie model of a globular cluster is spherically symmetric as regards its distribution of stars in space .",
    "however , its velocity ellipsoid tends to be elongated towards the center of the cluster for radii larger than some critical value @xmath7 .",
    "the phase space distribution of a stellar species with mass @xmath8 and whose one - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath0 , may be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the orbital momentum of the stars located at point m and whose velocities are @xmath11 .",
    "that orbital momentum is defined with respect to the cluster center o. the quantity @xmath12 is related to the stellar energy per unit mass @xmath13 through @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational potential at the tidal boundary @xmath16 of the cluster .",
    "whenever @xmath12 is negative , the distribution function @xmath17 vanishes . inside the radius of anisotropy @xmath18 ,",
    "the distribution of stellar velocities is spherical . beyond @xmath18 ,",
    "it straightens in the direction of the cluster center . at remote distances ,",
    "trajectories are almost radial .",
    "this is a major difference with king models for which velocities are spherically distributed .",
    "the mass density is now given by a double integral .",
    "the orbital momentum @xmath19 depends actually on both the magnitude @xmath20 of the velocity and on the angle @xmath21 between the latter and the radial direction @xmath22 . defining the variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 yields a mass density @xmath25 proportional to the double integral @xmath26 where the function @xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 the parameter @xmath29 is the difference between the reduced potential @xmath30 at the tidal boundary @xmath16 of the system and its counterpart @xmath31 at distance @xmath32 from the cluster center .",
    "the ratio @xmath33 is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the scaling factor between the mass density @xmath35 and the integral ( [ michie_2 ] ) may also be inferred from the relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the stellar mass density at the cluster center .",
    "so far , expression ( [ michie_2 ] ) was estimated numerically through a direct integration .",
    "we have derived here an analytic development of @xmath38 in terms of the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 the first integral is called the dawson s function and may be easily computed thanks to a convenient approximation due to rybicki ( rybicki 1989 and numerical recipes ) .",
    "the function @xmath41 is related to the error function @xmath42 the distribution function @xmath43 can be averaged over the angle @xmath21 to yield a king distribution up to a correction factor @xmath44 the parameter @xmath45 stands for the ratio @xmath46 .",
    "inside the radius of anisotropy , @xmath45 is small compared to unity and the correction factor @xmath47 of relation ( [ michie_king ] ) reduces to 1 .",
    "a king distribution is therefore recovered when the radius @xmath32 is smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "after an integration on the magnitude @xmath20 of the velocity , relation ( [ michie_2 ] ) may be expressed as @xmath48 \\label{h_u_a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] several approximations to that expression are given in the appendix depending on whether @xmath49 and @xmath50 are large or not with respect to unity .",
    "the dispersion velocity profile of globular clusters may be defined in various ways . what astronomers actually measure is the velocity of some stellar species along the line of sight .",
    "suppose that a specific pixel contains @xmath51 stars with same spectral type .",
    "the radial velocity of the i@xmath52 object of the sample is denoted by @xmath53 .",
    "a variety of statistical averages can be performed , each yielding a different value for the dispersion . in this article",
    ", the dispersion velocity @xmath54 along the line of sight will be defined as @xmath55 in our two component models , we will be interested in the velocity dispersion profile of the heavy and bright stellar population for which spectral measurements can be performed .",
    "let us consider now a line of sight with direction set by the unit vector @xmath56 as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . at the pericluster h ,",
    "the distance to the center o is minimal . for any given point m along that line of sight",
    ", a convenient frame may be defined with its unit vector @xmath57 pointing outwards in the same direction as the vector @xmath22 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath58 is perpendicular to @xmath57 and is in the plane defined by the three points o , h and m. finally , the last basis vector @xmath59 is defined as the product @xmath60 .",
    "the position of point m may be traced by the angle @xmath61 between the vectors @xmath62 and @xmath22 .",
    "the projection @xmath63 of the velocity along the line of sight is then given by @xmath64 its square @xmath65 may be averaged locally to yield @xmath66 because the velocity distribution is axisymmetric around the direction connecting point m to the cluster center o , the contribution of the product @xmath67 to the local average of the line of sight velocity @xmath68 vanishes .",
    "the latter may be expressed in terms of the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the mass density of the stellar species with mass @xmath8 under consideration at the point @xmath73 .",
    "the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively defined by the integrals @xmath76 and @xmath77 the functions @xmath78 and @xmath74 are related by @xmath79 so that @xmath74 may be expressed as @xmath80 the calculation of the function @xmath75 is slightly more involved and yields @xmath81 where @xmath82 notice that @xmath68 needs eventually to be averaged along the entire line of sight .",
    "the end result is therefore the radial average @xmath83 to be compared with the observational definition ( [ vr_obs ] ) .",
    "to test the sensitivity of observable quantities to the amount of dark matter , we built two - component michie models of globular clusters , with both a heavy and a light stellar population .",
    "one of the components encapsulates the visible , solar mass stars while the other component is dark matter in the form of low - mass objects with mass @xmath84 .",
    "the indexes 1 and 2 respectively refer to the bright and dark populations .",
    "we built 25 globular clusters , with anisotropy radii @xmath85 = 1000 , 100 , 50 , 20 and 10 , and dark matter content @xmath86 = 0 , 1 , 3 , 6 and 10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 stands for the ratio of the anisotropy radius @xmath18 to the typical scale length @xmath87 yet to be defined .",
    "models with @xmath85 = 1000 may be considered as king models . in that case , the anisotropy radius is so large that it contains most of the cluster , hence a spherical velocity distribution almost everywhere .",
    "a two - component michie model is completely specified by six parameters , namely the anisotropy radius @xmath18 , the velocity dispersions @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the two species , the normalization factors @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( or alternatively the central densities @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , and finally the depth of the gravitational potential well @xmath94 .",
    "these parameters are entirely determined by the following conditions  :    * \\(i ) the velocity dispersion for the luminous stars is measured .",
    "we will adopt the typical value @xmath95 .",
    "* \\(ii ) the two species are in thermal equilibrium , imposing the relation @xmath96 which sets @xmath89 equal to @xmath97 . *",
    "\\(iii ) the visible central density is set to @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to models having almost the same central brightness which , as a matter of fact , is a well measured quantity . *",
    "\\(iv ) the anisotropy radius has been varied as explained above .",
    "the smaller @xmath18 , the stronger the anisotropy . * \\(v ) the total visible luminosity is also a well determined quantity . here",
    ", it has been set equal to a typical value @xmath99 . throughout our set of models , @xmath93 and @xmath100",
    "have been chosen to yield that total luminosity , as well as the above mentioned ratios @xmath86 .",
    "remember that @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively stand for the total mass in heavy and in low mass stars .",
    "visible stars are assumed to have a standard solar @xmath103 ratio .",
    "low mass objects are too faint to shine and their luminosity is negligible .    the structure of the cluster is determined by the poisson equation where the local mass density is given by @xmath104 introducing the dimensionless radius @xmath105 where the typical scale length @xmath87 is defined as @xmath106 leads to the differential equation @xmath107 once that equation is solved and the structure of the cluster is determined , the velocity dispersion and the surface brightness profiles are computed .",
    "the former is evaluated with the help of relation ( [ velocity_dispersion ] ) .",
    "the latter is just the surface mass density of heavy stars @xmath108 up to the factor @xmath109 .",
    "profiles of the surface mass density @xmath110 and of the velocity dispersion @xmath54 for the heavy component of our models are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] respectively .",
    "low mass stars do not shine in the v band and therefore do not contribute to the surface luminosity of the cluster .",
    "figure  2 shows that whatever the anisotropy radius @xmath85 , the brightness profiles are almost not affected by the dark matter content of the cluster . at constant @xmath85 ,",
    "the various curves are superimposed while the light to heavy component mass ratio @xmath111 increases from 0 to 10 .",
    "this result was already obtained in the case of king models ( taillet et al . 1995 and 1996 ) and its validity is now extended to michie clusters . for @xmath85 = 10 and 20 ,",
    "the surface luminosity drops like @xmath112 as expected for a strongly anisotropic system . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , the velocity dispersion profiles are presented . for @xmath85 = 1000 ,",
    "velocities are almost spherically distributed and the curves are different when the dark matter abundance @xmath111 varies .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion along the line of sight becomes insensitive to the dark matter content of the cluster when the anisotropy of the velocity distribution increases . for @xmath85",
    "smaller than 20 , the various profiles start to be fairly similar and become hard to disentangle observationally . beyond the radius of anisotropy @xmath18",
    ", the stellar orbital velocity @xmath113 is dominated on average by the michie exponential cut - off on the orbital momentum .",
    "the orbital velocity is in that case of order @xmath114 .",
    "it is no longer sensitive to the gravitational potential .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath54 measured along the line of sight , to which the orbital velocity contributes most , is therefore blind to the mass content of the cluster .",
    "as @xmath85 decreases , the effect is more and more pronounced .",
    "when it becomes dominant everywhere outside the core radius of the cluster , the gravitational potential and therefore the dark matter of the system have little effect on @xmath54 , hence the degeneracy of the profiles in fig .  [ figure3 ] for @xmath85 = 10 . note that as velocities become radially distributed , light stars need more space to contribute the same dark mass as a result of the conservation of the phase space volume . at fixed @xmath111 ratio ,",
    "low mass stars extend further away as the velocity anisotropy increases .",
    "however , there is still a substantial amount of them inside the visible part of the cluster . when @xmath85 = 10 for instance",
    ", the dark mass inside the inner 60 pc is respectively @xmath115 and @xmath116 for a light to heavy stellar mass ratio @xmath111 of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the dashed curve that appears in three of the plots of fig .  [ figure3 ] is the velocity dispersion profile for a king model with no low mass stars .",
    "that case is degenerate with the entire set of michie clusters with @xmath119 , whatever their dark matter content . the same velocity dispersion profile",
    "may therefore be interpreted either with a one - component isotropic cluster or , alternatively , with an anisotropic system containing dark matter .",
    "if so , the degeneracy may be lifted by the distribution of surface luminosity .",
    "note however that the brightness profiles become different far from the center , in a region where the surface mass density @xmath110 has already dropped by four orders of magnitude with respect to its central value .",
    "figures  2 and 3 illustrate actually the difficulty to estimate the amount of low mass stars potentially concealed in globular clusters from their velocity dispersion profiles and from the distributions of their surface luminosities .",
    "both measurements have been used so far to determine the mass content of gcs .",
    "we therefore conclude that the same set of observations may be interpreted by quite different models .",
    "this suggests that the actual stellar mass function of many globular clusters needs to be reinvestigated .",
    "dark matter in globular clusters should be traced by the three dimensional velocity distribution of bright stars .",
    "we have just shown that the projection along the line of sight alone does not lead to a unique answer .",
    "another possibility is the search for tidal tails .",
    "if present , dark matter dominates the gravity of the outskirts of clusters and prevents heavy stars from evaporating ( moore 1996 ) .",
    "tidal tails exist whenever dark matter is not present to play that inhibition effect . as mentioned by taillet et al .",
    "( 1995 and 1996 ) , the presence of low mass stars should also lead to an infrared halo surrounding the bright central part .",
    "finally , if the cluster lies against a rich stellar background , low mass stars should also induce a few gravitational microlensing events .",
