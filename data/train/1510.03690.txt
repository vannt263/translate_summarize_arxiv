    "a large number of studies have investigated the properties of noisy chemical dynamics ( for recent reviews see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the topic stems from an increasing interest in understanding the dynamics of chemical systems with small numbers of molecules for one or more species , for which stochastic effects are important .",
    "a natural example of such chemical systems are biochemical pathways inside cells @xcite ; artificial examples include reactions occurring inside nano - spaces such as nano - reactors @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the approaches at the heart of these studies include brownian dynamics @xcite , the reaction - diffusion master equation ( rdme ) @xcite and its non - spatial counterpart , the chemical master equation ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "brownian dynamics typically models point or hard spherical molecules which diffuse and interact with each other via chemical and steric interactions .",
    "the rdme provides an approximate spatially discretised version of brownian dynamics , whereby space is divided into small volume elements ( voxels ) , reactions occur between point molecules inside each voxel and diffusion of molecules is simulated by `` hopping '' of molecules between neighbouring voxels .",
    "the cme is a non - spatial approximation of the rdme , valid in the limit of well - mixed dynamics throughout the whole compartment .",
    "while brownian dynamics is clearly the most realistic , the rdme and cme are far superior in terms of computational efficiency and have enabled the simulation of complex biochemical systems via the stochastic simulation algorithm ( ssa ) and its variants @xcite .",
    "another advantage of master equations is that in many cases , they either can be solved exactly ( see for example @xcite ) or else their solution computed by means of an approximative method such as moment - closure approximation @xcite or the system - size expansion @xcite ) leading to insight which can not be easily obtained by tediously long simulations using brownian dynamics .",
    "nevertheless a convincing argument can be made that the assumption of point molecules by the rdme and cme , is highly unrealistic , given that several experimental studies @xcite have suggested that volume exclusion effects due to molecular crowding strongly modulate intracellular chemical equilibria and even play an important role in the regulation of gene expression rates @xcite .",
    "brownian dynamics does not necessarily ignore such volume exclusion effects but is not an ideal simulation tool due to its heavy computational demand , not to mention its analytical impenetrability .",
    "a considerable number of studies have ignored chemical reaction kinetics and focused on understanding the diffusion of a tracer molecule in a sea of inert hard sphere molecules @xcite . a few studies have , in contrast , sought to understand the effect of crowding on the stochastic chemical properties of very simple chemical systems in the reaction - limited regime , by renormalising the propensities of the cme to account for volume exclusion effects @xcite .",
    "however to - date no general conclusions have been made , to our knowledge , about the impact of volume exclusion on the statistics of intrinsic noise in chemical systems .",
    "in other words , we would like to obtain insight into how the predictions of the rdme and cme for the distributions of molecule numbers of a general chemical system , are modified , if interacting molecules are modelled as hard particles with a finite radius .    in this paper",
    "we take a step in this direction .",
    "we assume that all the molecules in a general chemical system are roughly of equal molecular size and devise a version of the rdme ( the vrdme ) which models reactions between such particles .",
    "of course the assumption of a population of molecules with equal sizes is rough , however as we shall see it enables us to carry analytical calculations and to get a general idea of the impact of volume exclusion on the statistics of intrinsic noise .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss in detail the rdme and the vrdme , and their non - spatial counterparts , the cme and vcme , pointing out their crucial differences . in section",
    "iii we use these master equations to derive exact closed - form expressions for the local and global distributions of molecule numbers in the presence and absence of volume exclusion effects .",
    "the relationship between the rate constants of the volume excluded and dilute approaches is discussed in section iv .",
    "next we use the results of sections iii and iv to explore the stochastic properties of chemical systems with no chemical conservation laws ( section v ) , with chemical conservation laws of a special type ( section vi ) and with chemical conservation laws of a more general type ( section vii ) .",
    "the validity of the vrdme as an accurate approximation to a spatially continuous microscopic description is explored in section viii .",
    "we finally conclude by a summary and discussion in section ix .",
    "in this section , we concisely describe the four mathematical frameworks used in this article : the cme , the rdme , and modified versions of these two , which take into account volume exclusion effects , and which we call the the vcme and vrdme respectively . to clarify the differences between the four mathematical frameworks we use the example of a simple reversible dimerisation whereby two molecules of a monomer ( species a ) diffuse and eventually bind to form a single molecule of the dimer ( species b ) and which at a later time dissociates back into the constituent monomers .",
    "* the cme * describes the stochastic time evolution of the molecule numbers of each chemical species in a well - mixed compartment .",
    "a major simplifying assumption is that the molecules are point particles . for the dimerisation reaction , the cme models the chemical process @xmath0{k_0 } b$ ] , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the rate constants for the forward and backward reactions .    *",
    "the rdme * , is the spatial counterpart of the cme .",
    "the compartment is divided into @xmath3 subvolumes called voxels , each well - mixed ( well - mixing is not assumed throughout the whole volume , only locally ) .",
    "the rdme describes the stochastic time evolution of the molecule numbers of each chemical species in each voxel , with the assumption that the particles are point - like .",
    "for the dimerisation reaction , the rdme models the processes : @xmath4{k_0 } b_i,\\quad a_i \\xrightleftharpoons[k_d]{k_d } a_j,\\quad b_i   \\xrightleftharpoons[k_d]{k_d } b_j,\\quad j \\in ne(i ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes species a in voxel @xmath6 , @xmath7 denotes species b in voxel @xmath6 and the notation @xmath8 stands for the set of voxels which neighbour voxel @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 has units of inverse time and is proportional to the diffusion coefficient @xmath10 of the species ; specifically @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the side length of a voxel .",
    "the first reaction corresponds to the dimerisation reaction taking place in voxel @xmath6 , while the second and third reactions model the diffusion of the monomer and the dimer between neighbouring boxes @xmath6 and @xmath13 with rate @xmath9 .",
    "the rdme model with @xmath14 voxels is schematically represented in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the particles are empty to underline that they occupy no volume , and the grid corresponds to the voxels .",
    "the relationship between the rdme and cme will be clarified further in the next section .    *",
    "the vrdme * is a modified version of the rdme , which we introduce in this paper as a means to take into account volume exclusion effects . in the vrdme",
    ", molecules are assumed to have roughly the same diameter and the voxel size is fixed to this length scale ( unlike the rdme where the voxel size is arbitrary ) .",
    "a volume exclusion rule is implemented such that each voxel can accommodate at most one chemical molecule .",
    "an `` empty space species '' is defined whose molecule numbers reflect whether a voxel is empty or occupied .",
    "the volume exclusion rule is then implemented via the interaction of the empty space species and a chemical species .",
    "bimolecular reactions involve the interaction of two chemical molecules in neighbouring voxels . for the dimerisation reaction , the vrdme models the processes : @xmath15{\\tilde{k}_0 } b_i+e_j,\\quad    a_i+e_j \\xrightleftharpoons[\\tilde{k}_d]{\\tilde{k}_d } e_i + a_j,\\quad    b_i+e_j \\xrightleftharpoons[\\tilde{k}_d]{\\tilde{k}_d } e_i + b_j,\\quad j \\in ne(i ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes an `` empty space molecule '' in voxel @xmath6 (",
    "the molecule number of species @xmath16 takes a value of zero if voxel @xmath6 is occupied and one if it is empty ) .",
    "the first process models the chemical reaction between two @xmath17 particles in neighbouring voxels and the other two processes model the diffusion of molecules between neighbouring voxels .",
    "note that because we can interchange the indices @xmath6 and @xmath13 , the chemical reaction between two @xmath17 particles in neighbouring voxels @xmath6 and @xmath13 leads to either a @xmath18 molecule in voxel @xmath6 or a @xmath18 molecule in voxel @xmath13 .",
    "the reaction rates have a tilde to denote that these quantities are different than the rates used for the rdme ( see later for the relationship between the rate constants of the rdme and the vrdme ) . the vrdme model with @xmath19 voxels",
    "is illustrated schematically in fig.1(b ) .",
    "we note that the microscopic stochastic processes modelled by the vrdme have been previously simulated by means of monte carlo simulations on a two dimensional lattice , specifically applied to understanding diffusion - limited kinetics in crowded environments @xcite . as well",
    ", the vrdme is a special case of a class of stochastic population models based on  patch dynamics \" , a framework developed by mckane and newman in the context of ecological systems @xcite .",
    "specifically the vrdme corresponds to one of two types of spatial patch models , the case called `` micro - patch '' where each patch ( each voxel in our terminology ) can hold at most one individual .",
    "the bulk of studies to - date have however focused on the  mesoscopic - patch \" approach whereby each patch can hold at most a number @xmath3 of individuals where @xmath3 is typically a number much greater than one , and in which one assumes well - mixing and reactions occurring inside each patch , rather than between neighbouring patches ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "[ h ] [ fig1 ]    * the vcme * is the non - spatial counterpart of the vrdme .",
    "the vcme is to the vrdme , what the cme is to the rdme .",
    "hence the vcme is basically the cme but with two additional properties : ( i ) besides tracking the total number of molecules of each chemical species in the compartment , it also tracks the total number of empty space molecules in the compartment ( this new non - chemical species is denoted as e ) ; ( ii ) a global exclusion volume rule is imposed , namely that the total number of molecules of all species ( chemical species and the empty space species ) adds to a time - independent constant @xmath3 ( which corresponds to the number of voxels in the vrdme ) . for the dimerisation reaction , the vcme models the processes : @xmath20{\\tilde{k}_0 } b+e$ ] .",
    "note the difference between the cme and vcme ; the rate constants are also not the same , hence the tildes .",
    "the relationship between the vrdme and vcme will be clarified further in the next section .",
    "we have in this section introduced the various mathematical frameworks by means of a simple chemical reaction system but these are applicable to more general systems of chemical reactions .",
    "we will here focus on reversible chemical systems in equilibrium conditions , i.e. , those in detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that as we shall see , it enables us to write an explicit exact solution of the cme , rdme , vrdme and vcme , which will be crucial in later sections to understand the differences between them , i.e , the impact of molecular crowding on the stochastic dynamics of biochemical systems at the local ( voxel ) and global ( compartment ) level",

    "* global distribution of molecule numbers assuming point particle interactions*. consider a well - mixed reversible system of @xmath21 chemical species interacting via @xmath22 chemical reactions where the @xmath23 reaction has the form : @xmath24{k_j } r_{1j}x_{1}+ ... +r_{mj}x_{m},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath6th chemical species . here",

    "the time - evolution of the global ( whole compartment ) distribution of molecule numbers assuming point particles and well - mixed conditions is given by the cme .",
    "assuming mass - action kinetics , van kampen showed that the exact equilibrium solution of the cme for system ( [ system1c ] ) is given by @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a normalisation constant , @xmath38 is a kronecker delta and @xmath39 is the probability that the system is in state @xmath40 in equilibrium .",
    "hence the equilibrium solution is a product of poisson distributions constrained by the chemical conservation laws .",
    "* local distribution of molecule numbers assuming point particle interactions*. the result is also easily extensible to the rdme .",
    "the latter is a master equation describing the time - evolution of the probability that the system is in state @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of molecules of species @xmath25 in voxel @xmath13 and @xmath3 is the total number of voxels .",
    "this is a local description since it describes what happens at each point in space inside the compartment .",
    "now at the voxel level , no chemical conservation laws hold ; such laws are only global . for example",
    ", the reaction @xmath43 { } x_2 $ ] has the conservation law @xmath44 = constant , which is defined on the total number of molecules of @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the compartment , but locally in voxel @xmath13 , @xmath47 is not a constant due to the diffusive crosstalk with neighbouring voxels .",
    "it also follows that since we are considering a system in equilibrium , the deterministic concentration of a species in each voxel is the same as the deterministic concentration of the species in the whole compartment ( that is equal to the solution of the non - spatial deterministic rate equations ) .",
    "hence , given that there are only global conservation laws , that the local deterministic concentration is the same as the global deterministic concentration and that the voxel volume is @xmath48 , by analogy to the cme result above ( eq . ( [ vkresult ] ) ) , it follows immediately that the equilibrium probability distribution solution of the rdme is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the global concentration of species @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "* global distribution of molecule numbers for finite size particle interactions*. the result of van kampen can also be straightforwardly extended to the vcme .",
    "we will assume that the degree of molecular crowding is not so high that it prevents well - mixing in the limit of long times ; this is the case if all molecules are mobile .",
    "the reactions here are modified than those for the cme because of the interaction of the chemical and empty space species .",
    "hence the chemical system ( [ system1c ] ) is now modified to : @xmath52{\\tilde{k}_j } r_{1j}x_{1}+ ... +r_{m+1,j}x_{m+1},\\ ] ] where @xmath25 ,  @xmath53 are the chemical species and @xmath54 is the empty space species .",
    "the deterministic equilibrium constants are then given by : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the deterministic concentration of species @xmath25 according to the deterministic rate equations one would write for the reaction scheme ( [ modsystem1c ] ) .",
    "another difference from the cme is that besides the @xmath32 chemical conservation laws given by eq .",
    "( [ detclaws ] ) , we now also have an additional global conservation law stemming from volume exclusion , namely @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the total number of molecules which can be maximally fit in the compartment .",
    "given this information , by analogy with the cme result above ( eq . ( [ vkresult ] ) ) , it follows immediately that the equilibrium probability distribution solution of the vcme is given by : @xmath58 note that the global distribution is explicitly a function of @xmath3 ; this is in contrast to the global distribution of the cme which has no such information .    * local distribution of molecule numbers for finite size particle",
    "interactions*. the result of van kampen can also be extended to the vrdme .",
    "we will assume that molecular crowding does not prevent diffusion between any two voxels in the compartment ; this is the case if all molecules are mobile .",
    "this requirement is needed to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "since the system is in equilibrium , the deterministic concentrations in each voxel are the same as the deterministic concentrations in the whole compartment according to the vcme .",
    "the state vector is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the number of molecules of species @xmath25 in voxel @xmath13 ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 is the number of empty space molecules in voxel @xmath13 and @xmath3 is the total number of voxels .",
    "a crucial difference from the rdme is that in addition to global conservation laws , now we also have a conservation law in each voxel , namely there can be at most one molecule in each voxel , i.e. , @xmath63 , for @xmath64 .",
    "given this information and taking into account the fact that the voxel volume is @xmath48 , by analogy with the cme result above ( eq . ( [ vkresult ] ) ) , it follows immediately that the equilibrium probability distribution solution of the vrdme is given by : @xmath65    note that because of the constraints due to conservation laws ( chemical or volume exclusion ) , generally the mean concentration vector calculated using the exact equilibrium solutions of the cme , rdme , vcme and vrdme are not equal to their deterministic concentration vector ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) respectively , except in the macroscopic limit of large volumes .",
    "note also that the local distribution solutions are independent of the underlying connectivity of the lattice of the rdme and vrdme .",
    "this is because in equilibrium , the solution of a master equation is generally a product of poissonians constrained by local and global conservation laws @xcite , and these laws are not in any way influenced by the lattice connectivity .",
    "of course as previously mentioned the condition of detailed balance ( equilibrium ) is compatible only with those lattices such that there exists a path connecting any two lattice points .",
    "thus this is the only requirement on a lattice , for our results to hold .",
    "it is also a fact that in detailed balance ( equilibrium ) conditions , the global probability distribution calculated starting from the local distribution solution of the rdme exactly matches the global distribution solution of the cme , independent of the diffusion coefficients .",
    "the same applies to the vrdme and the vcme .",
    "this maybe intuitive to some readers but for the sake of completeness we provide a proof in appendix a. thus although we initially presented the vcme in section ii via an intuitive approach , the macroscopic solution of the vcme stands on a solid basis since it can be obtained from the microscopic approach of the vrdme .",
    "the rest of this article is devoted to obtaining insight into the effect of volume exclusion on the global distribution of molecule numbers and to a much lesser extent on the local distribution of molecule numbers .",
    "due to the equivalence of the vrdme and vcme in equilibrium conditions and at the global level of description , we shall use both interchangeably when referring to any conclusions made assuming a finite molecular radius .",
    "similarly we shall use rdme and cme interchangeably when discussing conclusions made assuming point particles .",
    "previously we have denoted the rate constants in the vcme formalism by tildes to clarify that they are different to those in the cme . here",
    "we show the connection between the two .",
    "we start by noting that the dilute limit of infinitesimally small molecules corresponds to the limit of infinitely large number of voxels @xmath3 ( in the vrdme and vcme ) at constant compartment volume @xmath29 .",
    "equivalently this corresponds to the limit , i.e. , @xmath68 , where practically all of space is empty ( species @xmath54 is the empty space species ) . in this limit , the deterministic ( global ) concentrations of the the vcme and of the cme must be equal , which for system ( [ system1c ] ) implies : @xmath69 this statement together with eqs .",
    "( [ deteqs ] ) and ( [ deteqsc ] ) implies : @xmath70 this equation encapsulates the relationship between the rate constants of the volume excluded and dilute probabilistic descriptions .",
    "for example for the reversible dimerisation reaction previously considered , the cme and vcme formulations model the reactions @xmath71{k_1 } x_2 $ ] and @xmath72{\\tilde{k}_1 } x_2 + x_3 $ ] respectively ( where @xmath73 is the empty space species ) , which implies the relation @xmath74 .",
    "it can be shown using the model reduction technique developed in @xcite that in the limit of abundant empty space species ( the dilute limit ) , the global distribution over the molecule numbers of the chemical species as given by the vcme , eq .",
    "( [ vcmesol ] ) , tends to the global distribution of the cme , eq .",
    "( [ vkresult ] ) .    using the relationship between the rate constants derived above",
    ", we can also understand how the effective equilibrium constant changes as a function of the strength of volume exclusion effects . according to the standard definition in physical chemistry and thermodynamics @xcite , the effective equilibrium constant of the jth reaction in system ( [ system1c ] ) in volume excluded and dilute conditions are respectively given by : @xmath75 now by eq .",
    "( [ deteqsc ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ relcnc ] ) we then have :",
    "@xmath76    this implies that the effective equilibrium constant of unimolecular reactions is unaffected by crowding since in this case @xmath77 because no space is involved .",
    "the effective equilibrium constant for bimolecular reactions is however increased relative to the one for non - crowded conditions , @xmath78 , since in this case a single molecule of empty space is produced when two molecules bind to form a single molecule ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this result for bimolecular reactions can indeed be deduced without any calculation but with the application of le chatelier s principle in physical chemistry @xcite to the vcme formalism .",
    "this principle states that a system in equilibrium will counteract the effect of an applied change by adjusting to a new equilibrium .",
    "now if we consider the reaction @xmath43 { } x_2 $ ] , this is modelled in the vcme formalism as @xmath43 { } x_2 + x_3 $ ] and hence by le chatelier s principle , an increase in volume exclusion , i.e. , a decrease in @xmath73 ( the empty space species ) will induce the system to shift its equilibrium to the right to counteract this decrease , in the process causing an increase in the amount of species @xmath46 and a decrease in the amount of species @xmath45 which amounts to an increase in the effective equilibrium constant .",
    "these results for unimolecular and bimolecular reactions encapsulate the essence of the thermodynamic theory of crowding developed by minton and co - workers @xcite .",
    "however it is the first time , to our knowledge , that they have been obtained using the deterministic limit of a master equation description .",
    "in this section we use the results of sections [ extension ] and [ detsec ] to show that _ if there are no chemical conservation laws then the marginal distribution of the global molecule numbers of each chemical species @xmath25 is poisson ( @xmath80 ) if crowding is ignored and binomial ( @xmath81 ) if crowding is taken into account_. here @xmath29 is the compartment volume , @xmath3 is the maximum number of particles which can be placed in the compartment if volume exclusion is taken into account , and @xmath31 and @xmath56 are the deterministic concentrations of the cme and vcme respectively .",

    "( [ conslaw1 ] ) , the global marginal distribution of the rdme and vrdme for a species not involved in the chemical conservation law is also poisson and binomial respectively ; ( iii ) for those systems with a chemical conservation law of the sum type , eq .",
    "( [ conslaw1 ] ) , the global marginal distribution of the rdme and vrdme for a species involved in the chemical conservation law is binomial .",
    "taking into account volume exclusion has very little or no impact on the fluctuations in this case ; ( iv ) for those systems with a chemical conservation law of a more general type , nothing can be directly deduced about the type of marginal distributions because of the complexity of the exact normalised probability distributions .",
    "however for a specific system of this type we found that the global fluctuations were neither poisson nor binomial for species involved in the chemical conservation law and that volume exclusion did have a strong impact on the fluctuations , in contrast to systems with a chemical conservation law of the sum type .    given points ( i)-(iii ) above , we can clearly state that the largest impact of volume exclusion is likely to be on the intrinsic noise statistics of those species not involved in chemical conservation laws ; the fact that the rdme solution is poisson while the vrdme solution is binomial implies that as the extent of molecular crowding increases , the fluctuations become increasingly sub - poissonian , deviations from the classical inverse square root law for the noise - strength become more apparent and the marginal distribution of molecule number fluctuations changes from being skewed to the right ( positive skewness ) to being skewed to the left ( negative skewness ) .",
    "we note that the vrdme used in our study is based on an inherent assumption that the size of all molecules , reactant and inert , are roughly the same and equal to the size of a voxel .",
    "this is , of course , a gross simplification of reality , nevertheless the major benefits of this formulation is that ( i ) the vrdme is exactly solvable in equilibrium conditions and ( ii ) it appears to be an accurate approximation of microscopic spatially continuous stochastic simulations .",
    "hence a comparison of the exact solution of the vrdme with the exact solution of the rdme ( which assumes point particles ) allows us to obtain a rough picture of the effects of volume exclusion on intrinsic noise , results which are difficult to obtain if we had to resort to computationally expensive stochastic simulations .",
    "open questions which remain to be addressed involve understanding the impact of volume exclusion on non - equilibrium steady - states and on the time evolution of moments ; these are challenging questions given that exact solutions of master equations are highly unlikely to be found in such conditions .",
    "finally we expect the extension of the vrdme framework to allow the modelling of chemical reactions involving hard molecules of various sizes to be of paramount importance for the accurate prediction of the effect of volume exclusion on real chemical systems .",
