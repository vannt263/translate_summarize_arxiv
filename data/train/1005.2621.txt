    "we match the psf of each frame to the @xmath40-band image ( which presents the worst seeing over our sample of 9 bands ) by convolving it with an appropriate gaussian .",
    "this sequence of psf - matching ensures that we measure the light in the same physical region of the source in all bands .",
    "this is a crucial requirement for meaningful modeling of the spectral energy distribution at a later stage .",
    "the psfs of these data are sufficiently similar that convolution with a simple gaussian provides adequate matching between images .",
    "object apertures are created by tracing a curve along the extended source and convolving it with the @xmath40-band psf .",
    "a series of apertures of increasing radial extent are defined as isophotes of this convolution .",
    "the apertures are very much non - circular , especially for the arc , and described by equivalent radii based on circular apertures that extend to the same isophotes .",
    "after a detailed sequence of sky subtraction and outlier masking , final magnitudes are measured at an equivalent radius of twice the fwhm of the @xmath40-band image , 7.6 pixels or @xmath55 , and aperture - corrected to an equivalent radius of @xmath56 based on the curve of growth of the psf reference star .",
    "lensed background sources are often found close to the center of the foreground galaxy cluster . in these generally crowded environments ,",

    "evidently their flux contribution has to be subtracted from the arc magnitude , but in this case the appropriate scaling can not be estimated easily .",
    "we create a color image for each frame by subtracting a scaled version of the @xmath3-band to make the arc vanish .",
    "the galfit models of the overlapping cluster members are then used to subtract any remaining positive flux at their positions and the original frame is restored by adding the scaled @xmath3-band back in .",
    "this process is unnecessary for the @xmath6- , @xmath37- and @xmath29-bands , were the contribution of the cluster members is negligible , and becomes more important for the longer wavelengths .",

    "the calibration of the images is handled carefully to ensure an accurate magnitude measurement of our object of interest .",
    "we calibrate the @xmath29- , @xmath3- and @xmath30-bands against the rcs2 catalog , which itself has been calibrated to match the sdss stellar locus ( gilbank et al . in preparation ) .",
    "there is a 0.05mag absolute calibration uncertainty associated with the rcs2 photometry .",
    "the @xmath37- and @xmath38-bands are calibrated from the @xmath57-photometry using transformations by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the near - ir @xmath39- , @xmath40- and @xmath7-bands are calibrated against the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) . the small field of view of the magellan @xmath39 and @xmath7 images does not include enough 2mass stars for a robust calibration , so we use the larger apo images to pick up enough 2mass objects and link the apo zeropoint to the magellan zeropoint based on a number of fainter point sources .",
    "each star used for zeropoint calibration undergoes the same procedure explained above for its flux measurement .",
    "this eliminates any differences between our measurement method and the surveys we are calibrating against and results in the most accurate zeropoint determination .",
    "we add the zeropoint uncertainty and the poisson error from the flux measurement in quadrature to construct final photometric uncertainties .",
    "final magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction @xcite and presented in table  [ tab : mag ] for the main arc and counter - image",
    "seperately . the photometry of the smaller and more regularly - shaped counter - image does not require the careful masking of cluster galaxies inside the source aperture and its measurement resembles much more a typical photometry measurement .",
    "after taking into account the lensing magnifications , the counter - image can therefore be used as a consistency check for the photometry of the giant arc .",

    "once the model set has been chosen , we have to worry about the internal degeneracies of a spectral energy distribution .",
    "age , metallicity and dust all tend to affect a galaxy s spectrum in similar ways ; the sed will overall be redder for a more metal rich stellar population , an older stellar population or more dust extinction . to decrease the uncertainties of the important stellar population parameters such as stellar mass and age which originate from this degeneracy , the metallicity is often treated as a known parameter .",

    "it is important to note that the code does not interpolate on the template grids ; the input template set must be densely populated .",

    "the age @xmath79 , reddening factor @xmath80 and star formation history @xmath77 depend solely on the galaxy colors , and should be similar for both images of the same background galaxy .",
    "the stellar mass and current star formation rate have an additional dependence on the lensing magnification and are corrected for the magnification factors obtained in   [ sec : lensmodel ] .",
    "the uncertainties related to the lens model need to be taken into account when comparisons are made for these two parameters .",

    "it is important to supplement the best - fit stellar population parameters with parameter confidence intervals allowed by the photometric uncertainties .",
    "we create 1000 fake realizations of the observed sed by perturbing each broadband magnitude measurement in a manner consistent with its errorbars .",
    "this set of fake seds is fit in exactly the same manner as described above for the observed sed ; bad fits with @xmath81 are excluded and the median and standard deviation are deduced for each stellar population parameter .",

    "however , there are other effects to be taken into account .",
    "first of all , the stellar mass reported from sed modeling corresponds to the mass turned into stars by the age of the galaxy based on its star formation history .",
    "this is an overprediction since during the galaxy s lifetime stars die and leave remnants whose mass is smaller than the initial one @xcite . for the relatively young age of rcsga 032727 - 132609",
    ", this mass returned to the interstellar medium ( ism ) will be a very small percentage .",
    "the biggest mass bias is caused by the use of single - component star formation history models .",
    "these attribute the emission at all wavelengths from rest - frame uv through near - ir to a single , smoothly declining or continuous episode of star formation , which is not a very realistic picture of the episodic star formation histories that arise in a hierarchical model of galaxy formation .",
    "when a young episode of star formation is superimposed on an older burst that peaked sometime in the past , the stellar mass contribution of this older stellar population will likely not be captured by single - component modeling of the overall sed . in order to set a rough upper limit on the range of stellar masses allowed by the sed of rcsga 032727 - 132609 ,",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite in combining a very young model , which dominates the emission at restframe uv wavelengths , with a maximally old underlying burst , which dominates the near - ir emission and whose age is only limited by the age of the universe at @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we scale a young ( @xmath83myr ) csf model to the observed @xmath3-band magnitude , subtract this model from the observed sed , and scale the maximally old ( @xmath84gyr , @xmath85myr ) model to match the residual near - ir magnitudes .",
    "the stellar mass is the sum of the two components , largely dominated by the older stellar population , and is found to be about twice as large as our best - fit single - component mass ( after correcting for the mass returned to the ism by supernovae ) .",
    "similarly , the age inferred from sed modeling represents the duration of the current episode of star formation and could be larger for an underlying older stellar population .",
    "we have assumed solar metallicity for the sed models to remove one parameter in the degeneracy between age , dust extinction and metallicity that arises from the spectral slope .",
    "it is of interest to explore the effect of sub - solar metallicity models on the best - fit stellar population parameters .",
    "the presence of the ciii ] nebular emission line could point to a metallicity similar to or less than 0.4z@xmath14 found for cb58 @xcite , which does not show this line in its spectrum ( see   [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "we fit the same range of models ( chabrier imf , calzetti dust extinction , @xmath86gyr or csf ) with 0.4 and 0.2z@xmath14 metallicities .",
    "we find acceptable fits for each metallicity , the best - fit seds are shown for the counter - image in figure  [ fig : met ] .    based on @xmath75-statistics ,",
    "the 0.2z@xmath14 models produce a worse fit , but the 0.4z@xmath14 best - fit model reports a better @xmath75 of 0.66 and 0.63 for the arc and counter - image respectively , compared to 0.87 and 0.89 for the default solar metallicity .",
    "the stellar population parameters from the 0.4z@xmath14 models are listed in table  [ tab : sed ] .",
    "they are overall consistent with the confidence intervals deduced earlier from the solar metallicity models ; the smaller ranges allowed for the age and stellar mass confirm that the 0.4z@xmath14 models produce overall better fits to the observed sed .",
    "@xcite have investigated the mass - metallicity relation for galaxies at @xmath87 and find a metallicity of @xmath88z@xmath14 for a stellar mass of @xmath89m@xmath14 , consistent with our results . from figure  [ fig :",
