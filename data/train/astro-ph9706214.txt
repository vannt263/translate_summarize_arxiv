    "the standard model which , on some large scale , is defined as a homogeneous and isotropic solution of einstein s equations for gravitationally interacting matter , has proved to be remarkably robust against various observational challenges especially of the recent past .",
    "it is this robustness together with a list of theoretical and observational arguments which makes it hard to see any need for an alternative to the standard model .",
    "nevertheless , there exist some simple arguments which let the standard model appear dogmatic and a replacement overdue , while most scientific activity in the field is directed towards a consolidation of the standard model .",
    "it is fair to say that most of the work , which is directed towards consolidation , is already based implicitly on the assumption that the standard model gives the correct picture .",
    "i here scetch a possible dialogue which we can watch without risk of being biassed by some prejudice : we have two people who try to defend their points of view and both of them might be biassed , but both advance arguments which can be proved or disproved .",
    "this dialogue is mirrored in an ongoing debate in the field of astrostatistics about the existence of evidence for a scale of homogeneity ( e.g. , davis 1996 and pietronero 1996 ) , a subject which is also dealt with in several contributions to this volume ( see : kerscher et al .",
    ", martnez , sylos labini et al . ) and was the subject of a panel discussion held during the meeting .",
    "let us start with the advocate of the standard model red : `` the ( large  scale ) standard model is a solution of friedmann s equations : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the cosmological constant , @xmath2 is related to the constant curvature of the model at time @xmath3 , @xmath4 the value of the homogeneous density at time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the scale function of the isotropically expanding ( or contracting ) universe . ''",
    "also : `` this model is unstable to perturbations in the density field and/or the velocity field , respectively '' , which is the well  known content of gravitational instability ; we may call this property _ local gravitational instability_. in spite of this instability , red supports the following conjecture about the global properties of the universe ( a statement which will come again in various refined versions later on ) :    * conjecture * ( version 1 ) : `` the universe can be _ approximated _ by the standard model , if _ averaged _ on some large scale @xmath7 , e.g. for the inhomogeneous density field we would have : @xmath8 for all times . ''    here , we may think for simplicity that the brackets @xmath9 denote euclidean spatial averages of some tensor field as a function of eulerian coordinates and time , @xmath10 .",
    "the newtonian case serves as a good illustration .",
    "below , we shall explain that the arguments carry over to riemannian spaces and general relativity .",
    "green replies : `` i do nt expect that spatial averaging and time evolution commute as a result of the nonlinearity of the basic system of equations . ''",
    "blue explains : `` if we average the cosmological fields of density and velocity at some initial time @xmath3 ( at recombination ) and use these average values ( which are remarkably isotropic according to the microwave background measurements ) as initial data of a homogeneous  isotropic solution , then , e.g. , the value of @xmath4 at time @xmath5 is expected to differ from the average field @xmath11 of the inhomogeneous initial data evolved to the time @xmath5 . this has been particularly emphasized by ellis ( 1984 ) . '' indeed , green is right : the explanation of non  commutativity is given by blue in terms of the _ commutation rule _ for the expansion scalar defined as the divergence of the velocity field @xmath12 ( buchert , ehlers 1997 ) : @xmath13 `` equation ( 2 ) shows that , on any spatial domain @xmath14 , the evolution of the average quantity differs from the averaged evolved one , the difference being given by a fluctuation term .",
    "for details and discussions of what follows see ( buchert 1996 and buchert & ehlers 1997 ) ; for the relation to dynamical models see ( ehlers & buchert 1997 ) . ''    also : `` equation ( 2 ) only assumes mass conservation , i.e. , we follow a tube of trajectories so that the mass in the spatial averaging domain @xmath14 is conserved in time .",
    "this is a sensible assumption , since we want to extend the spatial domain to the whole universe later on . ''",
    "blue goes further by specifying the local dynamical law for the expansion scalar .",
    "this is furnished by raychaudhuri s equation : `` introducing a scale factor via the volume @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( so , we do not care about the shape of the spatial domain @xmath14 ; it may expand anisotropically ) , raychaudhuri s equation for @xmath17 may be inserted into the commutation rule ( 2 ) resulting in the _ generalized friedmann equations _ : @xmath18 with the _ effective _ source term which involves averages over fluctuation terms of the expansion , the shear scalar @xmath19 and the vorticity scalar @xmath20 : @xmath21 @xmath22 thus , as soon as inhomogeneities are present , they are sources of the equation governing the average expansion",
    ". they may be negative or positive giving rise to an additional effective ( dynamical ) density which we may measure by the dimensionless ratio @xmath23 for @xmath24 , the source due to ` backreaction ' is , on the averaging domain , equal to that of the averaged matter density .",
    "the effective density does , in general , not obey a continuity equation like the matter density ; an effective mass is either produced or destroyed in the course of structure formation . ''",
    "red : `` in principle you are right , but i doubt that the effect is quantitatively significant . ''    green : `` irrespective of the global relevance of this term , it will play an interesting role on scales where its value is non ",
    "negligible ; for dominating shear fluctuations the ` backreaction ' could fake a ` dark matter ' component , since the mass in the standard friedmann equation will be overestimated in this case . ''",
    "red is going to advance a strong argument in favour of the standard model : `` in newtonian theory the ` backreaction ' term ( 4 ) vanishes by averaging over the whole universe , if the latter is topologically closed , i.e. , compact and without boundary . ''    indeed , he succeeds in writing the local term @xmath26 as a divergence of some vector field @xmath27 , @xmath28 , if he assumes space to be euclidean .",
    "`` hence , using gau s theorem , we may transform the volume integral in the average @xmath29 into a surface integral over the boundary @xmath30 of the averaging domain . for compact universes without boundary ( e.g. , a 3torus @xmath31 ) this surface integral",
    "is zero ; we obtain @xmath32 on the torus . ''",
    "blue : `` as a side  result red proved that the currently employed models for large  scale structure , analytical or n  body simulations , are constructed correctly : the assumption _ of periodic boundary conditions _ is equivalent to using as the 3space a hypertorus , not @xmath33 .",
    "these models so far have been assumed to be friedmannian on average _ by construction _ rather than derivation . ''",
    "green adds a disclaimer : `` the above argument depends on the flatness of space . ''",
    "red : `` but , as was shown in ( buchert & ehlers 1997 ) the generalized friedmann equations ( 3 ) also hold for irrotational flows in general relativity . ''",
    "green : `` yes , but not the fact that the local term @xmath34 can be written as a divergence of some vector field , which makes , besides spatial curvature , a crucial difference . ''",
    "blue illustrates this last statement by green by some technical explanations : `` if one introduces normal ( gaussian ) coordinates @xmath35 and thus foliates spacetime into flow ",
    "orthogonal hypersurfaces of constant time ( this is only possible for irrotational flows ) , then eqs .",
    "( 3 ) also hold . since eqs .",
    "( 3 ) are equations for scalar quantities , they are manifestly covariant and will hold in any coordinate system .",
    "the crucial difference to the newtonian treatment , however , is the non  integrability of inhomogeneous deformations ( as defined below ) : write the metric of the spatial hypersurfaces as a quadratic form @xmath36 involving the one  forms @xmath37 , then it is necessary and sufficient for the metric to be flat that the one  forms are exact , i.e. , @xmath38 , and the coefficients @xmath39 reduce to a deformation gradient with respect to lagrangian coordinates , @xmath40 ; in other words , the coefficient matrix @xmath41 which measures the deformations is integrable .",
    "the non  integrability of @xmath41 implies the non  existence of a vector field @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , we can not shift a volume averaged quantity to a contribution on the boundary of the averaging domain and the conclusion on the vanishing of ` backreaction ' for models with non ",
    "euclidean space sections can not be drawn using red s argument . ''",
    "green : `` this remark by blue is bad news in so far as we expect the valid theory to be general relativity on the large scales under consideration . ''",
    "blue : `` again , we can formulate a side  result concerning current models of large  scale structure : if we model structure in , e.g. , an undercritical  density universe ( the total density parameter being @xmath42 ) , then the model _ has to be _ interpreted as a newtonian model .",
    "it makes sense to speak about hypersurfaces of constant negative curvature for the average model , but in that case there currently exists no proof that the average model is friedmannian for closed , curved spaceforms .",
    "moreover , it is then not even possible to introduce a simple hypertorus topology , since this is incompatible with a hyperbolic geometry ( compare , e.g. , lachize  rey & luminet 1995 ) . ''",
    "red summarizes the preceeding findings and reformulates his statement :    * conjecture * ( version 2 ) :  on some large scale @xmath7 we still may approximate the metric of spatial hypersurfaces by the flat euclidean metric .",
    "then , we have two options ( which both are connected with the requirement of periodic boundary conditions ) :    either ,    @xmath43 we live in a `` small universe '' ( ellis 1971 , ellis & schreiber 1986 ) , i.e. , space is genuinely compact without boundary and has a finite size @xmath44 .",
    "this we may call _ topological closure condition _ ( option a ) .    or ,    @xmath43 the value of @xmath45 is numerically negligible on the scale @xmath7 .",
    "this would support the generally held view and we may call this _ technical closure condition _ ( option b ) , since then option a is a justified approximation . ",
    "green : `` i agree that a compact universe is appealing , since only then we have some hope to explore a substantial fraction of its volume ; however , it may then not have flat space sections . ''",
    "green accepts the flatness of space as a working hypothesis in order not to complicate the discussion : `` if we do nt have option a ( in which case red s argument is exact ) , we have to examine the ` backreaction ' term @xmath46 in more detail quantitatively '' .",
    "green develops his argument : `` the terms in @xmath46 have positive contributions ( vorticity and expansion fluctuations ) , @xmath47 , and negative ones ( shear fluctuations ) , @xmath48 '' , and `` each individual fluctuation term has fixed sign and , thus , does not vanish on _ any _ scale '' .",
    "blue : `` an immediate consequence of the positivity of these terms is that their values may decay with scale until we reach a representative volume of the universe , but as soon as we have reached this , these terms approach a finite positive value , even on a scale on which we may assume periodic boundary conditions . ''",
    "green concludes that `` the requirement of vanishing or smallness of the sum @xmath49 implies a _ conspiracy _ between vorticity , shear and expansion fluctuations , which is not to be expected a priori . ''",
    "the final refinement of red s statement therefore assumes the form :    * conjecture * ( version 3 ) :  on some large scale @xmath7 we still may approximate the metric of spatial hypersurfaces by the flat euclidean metric . in general we may not expect that the universe is genuinely periodic on the scale @xmath7",
    ". however , on that scale , the term @xmath50 has a negligible value :    either , because :    @xmath43 each of the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 is numerically small , so that the conspiracy assumption does not matter .    or , because ( if the terms are not numerically small ) :    @xmath43 the inhomogeneities evolve such that @xmath53 for scales approaching @xmath7 _ and for all times_. ",
    "blue : `` both options imply assumptions on the initial fluctuation spectrum , and both formulate properties of gravitational _ dynamics _ which is , in principle , testable . ''",
    "red : `` i agree that we want , under all circumstances , avoid `` fine  tuning '' ; the standard model should be generic for a wide range of dynamical models for the evolution of inhomogeneities . ''",
    "green now argues on the grounds of gravitational dynamics : `` up until now there is no dynamical model which includes the full ` backreaction ' ( apart from perturbative studies which may capture some of the effect  see futamase 1989 , 1996 , bildhauer 1990 and bildhauer & futamase 1991a , b , as well as russ et al .",
    "1997 ) ; the main problem to construct such a model is the following : not only the inhomogeneities affect the global expansion , but also any model for the evolution of inhomogeneities will depend on how the average evolves in time . ''",
    "blue details :  the latter is principally known from the linear theory of gravitational instability : if the universe expands faster , then the inhomogeneities have a harder time to form . here , we are faced with a nonlinear self  interaction problem :    we may start with a flat friedmann model as background ( the average of the ricci scalar is zero ) , and some model for the inhomogeneities relative to this background . from the inhomogeneous model",
    "we calculate the ` backreaction ' ( this was recently attempted by russ et al .",
    "however , if there is a nonvanishing ` backreaction ' on the global scale @xmath7 , then this procedure gives us just the first step in the sense of an iteration ; in the second step we would have a curved background ( the average of the ricci scalar is nonzero ) , and we would have to construct an inhomogeneous model for a curved background including the ` backreaction ' from the first iteration . in turn",
    "the second iteration would yield the ` backreaction ' for this model , and the full ` backreaction ' could be calculated after @xmath54 steps of this procedure provided there is convergence to a solution . ",
    "green : `` it is clear that we are far from being able to investigate such a model . for example , in a curved background we can neither use simple periodic boundary conditions , nor can we work with the standard fourier transformation ; we would have to work with eigenfunctions on curved spaces and would have to respect the compatibility with some , in general , nontrivial topologies . ''",
    "one `` way out '' is to cheat : green bases his further argumentation on the standard newtonian model : `` we may use the standard model which is mathematically well  defined as the average over a general inhomogeneous but periodic newtonian model , and let the box of the simulation extend to very large scales . then , the ` backreaction ' can be calculated for subensembles of the simulation box on scales which we consider representative for the universe . '' this possible study will at least give us some quantitative clues of the effect ; it is the subject of an ongoing work ( buchert et al .",
    "1997 ) which blue is going to scetch in the next section .",
    " let us assume , in agreement with conjecture 3 by red , that the space sections are euclidean and that the inhomogeneities can be subjected to periodic boundary conditions on some large scale .",
    "usually , this scale is set to be around @xmath55mpc / h , mainly because of limits on cpu power using n  body simulations .",
    "however , a recent analysis of the iras 1.2 jy catalogue ( see kerscher et al . ,",
    "this volume ) has demonstrated that fluctuations in the matter distribution do not vanish on that scale .",
    "a mock catalogue of the iras sample produced by a simulation with a box size of @xmath56mpc / h enforces the fluctuations to vanish on the periodicity scale , and the corresponding analysis of the mock sample shows disagreement in all moments ( except the first ) of the matter distribution with the observed data ( see kerscher et al .",
    ", this volume and kerscher et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this example shows that not only fluctuations in the average density are an indication for inhomogeneities , but averages over higher ",
    "order moments of the density field ( e.g. reflected by averaged shear fluctuations ) create huge ( phase  correlated ) , possibly low  amplitude structures .",
    "thus , even if we do not argue globally about the ` backreaction problem ' ( the ` backreaction ' is zero by construction due to the assumed newtonian description and the periodicity ) , this effect has to be seriously considered on scales of current all  sky surveys .",
    "this study entails , from a dynamical point of view , a quantification of _ cosmic variance _ within the standard model .",
    "we therefore have to run simulations of a considerably larger spatial extent ; we may use for simplicity `` truncated lagrangian schemes '' .",
    "these schemes have been shown to agree with n  body results down to scales around the correlation length ( melott et al .",
    "1994 , wei et al . 1996 ) and , thus , are suitable tools to realize boxes of gigaparsec extent . for this purpose",
    "it may be considered sufficient to use the `` truncated first  order scheme '' ( known as tza ; `` truncated zeldovich approximation '' , coles et al . 1993 ) .    in a work in progress",
    "buchert et al . (",
    "1997 ) consider two cobe normalized cosmogonies , standard  cdm and a cdm model with cosmological constant .",
    "both cosmogonies are realized for a box of 1.8 gpc / h with an effective resolution of @xmath57 lagrangian fluid elements .",
    "the simulation box is then subdivided into smaller boxes and the ensemble average is taken over values of the dimensionless relative ` backreaction ' ( 4 ) .",
    "other quantities like the expected hubble constant or the expected density parameter including ` backreaction ' are also studied both numerically and analytically .",
    "-6.2 true cm    a plot of the absolute value of @xmath58 , normalized by the global mean density , for the initial conditions scdm against scale is shown in figure 1 , which already gives a clear representation of the scale dependence of the effect under study .",
    "the absolute values are shown here , because @xmath58 might be negative or positive in subsamples , and the overall sum is , by assumption , zero .",
    "the absolute value is then an estimate of the expected ` backreaction ' on some scale .",
    "however , in some subsamples the effect may be smaller or larger .",
    "three preliminary conclusions may be drawn from the first results of this study :    @xmath43 the magnitude of the ` backreaction ' source term is of the same order as the mean density and higher on scales @xmath59mpc / h for scdm .",
    "it quickly drops to a @xmath60 effect on scales of @xmath61mpc / h .    @xmath43 the magnitude of the ` backreaction ' source term is proportional to the r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuations almost independent of scale . compared to the density fluctuations it amounts to a factor of about @xmath62 for scdm .",
    "@xmath43 using the `` zeldovich approximation '' we can calculate analytically the ` backreaction ' @xmath63 .",
    "this calculation shows that @xmath63 is a _ growing _ function of time in an expanding universe . ",
    " this debate brought up one fundamental result which supports red : any inhomogeneous newtonian cosmology , whose flat space sections are confined to a length ",
    "scale @xmath7 on which the matter variables are periodic , averages out to the standard model . on this global scale",
    "there is no ` backreaction ' and the cosmological parameters of the homogeneous ",
    "isotropic solutions of friedmann s equations are well  defined also for the average cosmology on that scale .",
    "setting up simulations of large  scale structure in this way is correct , and a global comoving coordinate system can be introduced to scale the whole cosmology .",
    "this validates the common way of constructing inhomogeneous models of the universe .    on the other hand ,",
    "green s arguments initiate two well  justified ways of saying that this architecture is `` forced '' due to the settings of a ) excluding curvature of the space sections , and b ) requiring periodic boundary conditions :    one way is to analyze the effect of ` backreaction ' on scales smaller than the periodicity scale , and base this analysis upon the standard model , however , by extending the spatial size of periodicity to very large scales .",
    "the results obtained in the framework of a well  tested approximation scheme are three  fold : first , they show the importance of the influence of the inhomogeneities on average properties of a chosen spatial domain , _ although _ the `` forcing conditions '' bring the effect down to zero on the scale @xmath7 .",
    "second , the ` backreaction ' value is numerically small on large scales , but it is _ always _ larger than the r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuations ; in other words : taking the amplitudes of density fluctuations serious ( e.g. by normalizing the cosmogony on some large scale ) always implies the presence of , e.g. , shear fluctuations which are neglected on that scale in the standard model .",
    "third , they show that the effect is a growing function of time . from the latter result",
    "we may establish the notion of _ global gravitational instability _ of the standard model as opposed to the well  known local instability : it states that , as soon as the ` backreaction ' has a non  zero value at some time",
    ", this value will be increasing ; the average model drifts away from the standard model .",
    "the second `` forcing '' is due to the newtonian treatment .",
    "being justified on smaller scales , a newtonian model is expected to fail just when we approach the _ large _ scales of periodicity which we have to consider to justify neglection of the ` backreaction ' effect .",
    "setting up a general  relativistic model unavoidably implies the presence of local curvature and will , in general , yield a nonvanishing average curvature for inhomogeneous models .",
    "neither simple periodic boundary conditions can be employed , nor can be proved that the ` backreaction ' effect should vanish globally , at least for compact space sections without boundary . ",
    "both , red and green , are right , but if red s assumptions are weakened , the resulting cosmology has much richer properties and can not be confined to a simple box : it will take its additional degrees of freedom to evolve away from the standard model .",
    "green s more general view suffers from the fact that an alternative model is yet not formulated , but it is definitely within reach .",
