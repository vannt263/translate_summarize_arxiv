    "yannakakis introduced in @xcite the following communication complexity problem , called _ clique versus independent set _ ( @xmath0 for brevity ) : given a publicly known graph @xmath11 on @xmath12 vertices , alice and bob agree on a protocol , then alice is given a clique and bob is given a stable set .",
    "they do not know which clique or which stable set was given to the other one , and their goal is to decide whether the clique and the stable set intersect or not , by minimizing the worst - case number of exchanged bits .",
    "note that the intersection of a clique and a stable set is at most one vertex . in the deterministic version ,",
    "alice and bob send alternatively messages one to each other , and the minimization is on the number of bits exchanged between them .",
    "it is a long standing open problem to prove a @xmath13 lower bound for the deterministic communication complexity . in the non - deterministic version , a prover knowing the clique and the stable set sends a certificate in order to convince both alice and bob of the right answer .",
    "then , alice and bob exchange one final bit , saying whether they agree or disagree with the certificate .",
    "the aim is to minimize the size of the certificate .    in this particular",
    "setting , a certificate proving that the clique and the stable set intersect is just the name of the vertex in the intersection .",
    "such a certificate clearly has logarithmic size . convincing alice and bob that the clique and the stable set do not intersect is much more complicated .",
    "a certificate can be a bipartition of the vertices such that the whole clique is included in the first part , and the whole stable set is included in the other part .",
    "such a partition is called a cut that separates the clique and the stable set .",
    "a family @xmath14 of @xmath15 cuts such that for every disjoint clique and stable set , there is a cut in @xmath14 that separates the clique and the stable set is called a cs - separator of size @xmath15 .",
    "observe that alice and bob can agree on a cs - separator at the beginning , and then the prover just gives the name of a cut that separates the clique and the stable set : the certificate has size @xmath16 .",
    "hence if there is a cs - separator of polynomial size in @xmath12 , one can ensure a non - deterministic certificate of size @xmath17 .",
    "yannakakis proved that there is a @xmath18 certificate for the @xmath0 problem if and only if there is a cs - separator of size @xmath19 .",
    "the existence of such a cs - separator is called in the following the clique - stable set separation problem .",
    "the best upper bound so far , due to hajnal ( cited in @xcite ) , is the existence for every graph @xmath20 of a cs - separator of size @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath0 problem arises from an optimization question which was studied both by yannakakis @xcite and by lovsz @xcite .",
    "the question is to determine if the stable set polytope of a graph is the projection of a polytope in higher dimension , with a polynomial number or facets ( called extended formulation ) .",
    "the existence of such a polytope in higher dimension implies the existence of a polynomial cs - separator for the graph .",
