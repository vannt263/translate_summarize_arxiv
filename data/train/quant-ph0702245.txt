    "[ sec:1 ]    one of the most important problems in theoretical computer science is the oracle identification problem .",
    "this can be described in the following way .",
    "we are given a device , known as an oracle , which is promised to compute one of a known set of functions .",
    "the oracle identification problem consists of determining which function the oracle computes .",
    "it is understood that we are not permitted to investigate the internal workings of the device .",
    "instead , it is treated as a black box .",
    "the only information at our disposal is our record of the input and of the output it gives rise to .",
    "the action of the oracle is a physical process by which the output is computed from the input . to the best of our current knowledge ,",
    "all physical processes are quantum mechanical .",
    "if we are to describe the action of the oracle quantum mechanically , it will be represented by a quantum channel , or operation , with a different operation corresponding to each possible function . however , quantum channels , unitary channels in particular , can operate coherently on superpositions of quantum states , giving rise to the well - known phenomenon of quantum parallelism .",
    "this parallelism can be exploited to perform oracle identification with lower query complexity , i.e. with fewer uses of the oracle , than can be achieved classically .    as a consequence of the coherent information processing capabilities of unitary operators , in quantum computation ,",
    "oracles are conventionally taken to be unitary processes .",
    "the quantum oracle identification problem is then essentially a problem of discrimination among individual , or sets of unitary operators , where each operator coherently computes one of a known set of functions .",
    "these operators are naturally known as oracle operators .",
    "it is often unnecessary to distinguish among all of the possible oracle operators corresponding to a given set of functions individually , but only among subsets of the total possible set , for the advantages of a quantum over a classical oracle to become evident .",
    "indeed , the first demonstrations of quantum computational speed - up , those apparent in the deutsch @xcite and later deutsch - jozsa @xcite algorithms , which demonstrated accelerated discrimination between uniform and balanced functions , exemplified the enhanced distinguishability of sets of quantum oracle operators over their classical counterparts .",
    "discrimination among sets of functions with different periodicities is central to the simon @xcite and shor @xcite algorithms .",
    "again , it is the fact that this can be carried out more efficiently with quantum oracle operators than known classical methods which is responsible for the quantum computational speed - up . the quantum searching algorithm discovered by grover @xcite",
    "can also be interpreted as an oracle identification problem @xcite , although one where the aim is a fine - grained discrimination among individual functions rather than larger sets .",
    "it was developments such as these , which demonstrated the superior distinguishability of quantum oracle operators over corresponding classical channels for specific classes of functions , that led to the oracle identification problem being investigated in general terms .",
    "if we wish to identify an unknown function of an @xmath0-ary variable , then classically , we must evaluate it for each of these possible values , which implies @xmath0 oracle calls .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , it was shown by van dam @xcite that a quantum oracle corresponding to such a function can be identified with probability @xmath1 with @xmath2 calls . further general results relating to quantum query complexity have been obtained by iwama and collaborators @xcite and by fahri et al .",
    "in particular , the latter authors established an upper bound on the number of functions that can be identified with a fixed number of calls and a given correct identification probability . here",
    ", the different functions were encoded in generally non - orthogonal states and distinguished using a projective measurement , with each outcome corresponding conclusively to one of the possible functions .",
    "the impossibility of perfect discrimination among non - orthogonal states with a projective measurement implies that there would be a non - zero probability of this result being erroneous .",
    "however , it is sometimes possible to distinguish among non - orthogonal states using the alternative strategy of unambiguous state discrimination @xcite . here",
    ", we are not always guaranteed a conclusive result , although when one is obtained , it will necessarily be correct .",
    "as such , unambiguous state discrimination is inherently probabilistic . unlike state discrimination strategies where we tolerate errors , it is not possible to unambiguously discriminate among an arbitrary set of states . for a set of pure states to be unambiguously distinguishable",
    ", they must be linearly independent @xcite and a more complex constraint applies to general mixed states @xcite .    in relation to oracle identification , the potential applicability of unambiguous discrimination was first investigated by bergou et al .",
    "these authors demonstrated how one can obtain generalisations of the deutsch - jozsa algorithm , where the oracle operators encode information in non - orthogonal states .",
    "they nevertheless yield unambiguously correct information .",
    "this suggests that unambiguous discrimination may have an important role to play in quantum information processing , particularly in relation to probabilistic algorithms .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explore this possibility further .",
    "we address the problem of unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators in general . in order to investigate this matter , it is helpful to have a broad understanding of unambiguous discrimination among unitary operators @xcite .",
    "as such , section [ sec:2 ] is devoted to presenting some preliminaries , some of which are new results , relating to this general problem . among these is a simple , practical criterion for determining when an arbitrary set of unitary operators is unambiguously distinguishable and a proof that entanglement with an ancilla can not aid any discrimination or estimation procedure for commuting unitary operators .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] is concerned with another preliminary topic , the properties of oracle operators . here",
    ", we describe the main properties of standard oracle operators , which can be constructed for all functions from @xmath3 with arbitrary positive integers @xmath4 @xcite and minimal oracle operators , which have the advantage of acting on a smaller register although they are possible only for invertible functions @xcite . throughout , we take these to be permutations .",
    "in contrast with other treatments , we make novel use of the pegg - barnett phase operator @xcite , as we find that this can be used to obtain an appealing and useful compact representation of standard oracle operators . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    ", we apply our general criterion for the unambiguous distinguishability of unitary operators to both standard and minimal oracle operators .",
    "remarkably , it is found that the unambiguous distinguishability criterion is the same for both kinds of oracle operator .",
    "the next two sections are concerned with applying this criterion to oracle operators corresponding to various interesting sets of functions . in section [ sec:5 ] , we show that it is impossible to unambiguously discriminate among the standard oracle operators corresponding to all functions from @xmath3 for any fixed @xmath0 and @xmath5 both @xmath6 .",
    "however , we also show that the grover oracle operators corresponding to an arbitrary sized unsorted database can be unambiguously discriminated with one shot .",
    "this is noteworthy because perfect discrimination among grover oracle operators is possible only for an unsorted database with at most four entries @xcite .",
    "section [ sec:6 ] is concerned with oracle operators corresponding to sets of functions which we refer to as being totally indistinguishable .",
    "a totally indistinguishable set of functions is a set for which one can never determine which function was computed by a classical oracle with known input and output data .",
    "it is found that , if the functions are distinct , then there must be at least four functions in a set with this property .",
    "we analyse in some detail the situation where the input variable is boolean .",
    "it is found that sets of such functions admit a simple graphical representation in terms of which the total indistinguishability condition takes a geometrically appealing form .",
    "this representation , together with various graph - theoretic results which apply to it , is used to prove that for no finite set of totally indistinguishable functions from @xmath7 are the corresponding standard oracle operators unambiguously distinguishable for any integer @xmath8 .",
    "this is not the case for totally indistinguishable functions on a larger domain .",
    "we present a complete characterisation of sets of four functions whose domain is at least three - valued and with arbitrary , fixed finite integer range @xmath8 which are totally indistinguishable yet whose standard oracle operators are unambiguously distinguishable .    in section [ sec:7 ]",
    ", we consider the possibility of unambiguous oracle operator discrimination with multiple calls . in this article",
    ", we focus mainly on unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators with just one call to the oracle .",
    "if this is not possible , the oracle operators may nevertheless be unambiguously distinguishable if we are permitted @xmath9 calls .",
    "we restrict our attention to parallel calls , where registers are not reused for subsequent calls .",
    "we obtain sufficient conditions , in terms of properties of the set of functions in question , for this to be possible .",
    "section [ sec:8 ] is devoted to discussing the relationship between standard and entanglement - assisted minimal oracle operators .",
    "it is found that they have an intriguing unitary superoperator interconvertibility property , whose implications are explored .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec:9 ] with a discussion of our results and suggestions for future research on this topic .",
    "[ sec:2 ]    to address the problem of unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators , it will be helpful to have an appreciation of what can be achieved in relation to unambiguous discrimination among unitary operators in general and of any general limitations that apply .",
    "discrimination among a set of unitary operators is achieved be letting one of them act upon an initial probe statend and then discriminating among the possible output states in order to determine which operator was implemented .",
    "the most general scenario we can consider is the following .",
    "imagine that we have a quantum system @xmath10 with @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that there is also an ancilla @xmath13 having @xmath14-dimensional hilbert space @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "these two systems are initially prepared in a joint , possibly entangled probe state .",
    "we may take this initial state to be pure by considering a sufficiently large ancilla , which we will do and write this state as @xmath17 .",
    "we then act on @xmath10 with one of @xmath18 unitary operators @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath18 possible final states after this action will be denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "our task is to determine which of these states was produced , which will in turn tell us which of the @xmath19 acted on @xmath10 .    to do so unambiguously , that is , with zero probability of error but allowing for some probability ( strictly ) @xmath22 of an inconclusive result for each @xmath23 , we require the @xmath21 to be linearly independent @xcite .",
    "we may then ask : what properties must the @xmath19 possess to produce a linearly independent set of output states for at least one possible probe state @xmath24 , since this is clearly the condition for the @xmath19 being unambiguously distinguishable .",
    "it is known that :    [ thmlind ] a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath18 unitary operators acting on a hilbert space @xmath12 to be unambiguously distinguishable is that they are linearly independent . moreover , a linearly independent set of unitary operators can always be unambiguously discriminated using any probe state with maximum schmidt rank @xmath11 , the dimensionality of @xmath12 .",
    "this was proven originally by chefles and sasaki as a special case of a more general result @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of both completeness and convenience , we provide here a simplified proof . + * proof * : we begin by proving , by contradiction , the necessity of the linear independence of the unitary operators @xmath19 for them to be amenable to unambiguous discrimination .",
    "if these operators are linearly dependent , then there exist @xmath18 coefficients @xmath25 , not all of which are zero , such that @xmath26 . for these coefficients ,",
    "we have , for any probe state @xmath24 , @xmath27{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}_{a}\\right]|{\\psi}_{qa}{\\rangle}=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath28{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}_{a}$ ] is the identity operator on the ancilla hilbert space @xmath15 .",
    "this shows that the final states @xmath21 are linearly dependent for any probe state @xmath24 and are thus unamenable to unambiguous discrimination .",
    "it follows that linearly dependent unitary operators can not be unambiguously discriminated .    to prove that the @xmath19 can be always be unambiguously discriminated if they are linearly independent and that this can be achieved with any probe state @xmath24 which has maximum schmidt rank",
    ", we again use an argument by contradiction .",
    "we will employ the following :    [ lma : zerop ] let @xmath24 , where @xmath16 , be a state vector in @xmath29 with maximum schmidt rank , i.e. schmidt rank=@xmath11 .",
    "the only operator @xmath30 acting on @xmath12 for which @xmath31{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}_{a})|{\\psi}_{qa}{\\rangle}=0 $ ] is the zero operator .    * proof * : let us write @xmath24 in schmidt decomposition form : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 form an orthonormal basis for @xmath34 , the @xmath35 form an orthonormal subset of @xmath36 and the schmidt coefficients @xmath37 are , by assumption , all non - zero . if @xmath31{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}_{a})|{\\psi}_{qa}{\\rangle}=0 $ ] , then upon taking the inner product throughout on the @xmath13 system with an arbitrary element of the set @xmath38 and making use of the fact that the corresponding schmidt coefficient is non - zero , we find that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "hence all matrix elements of @xmath30 in the @xmath33 basis are zero and so @xmath30 is the zero operator .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "@xmath41 + to make use of this , suppose that we have a probe state @xmath24 with maximum schmidt rank such that the final states @xmath21 are unamenable to unambiguous discrimination , i.e. they are linearly dependent .",
    "then there exist coefficients @xmath25 , not all of which are zero , such that eq .",
    "is true . applying lemma [ lma : zerop ] , with @xmath42",
    ", we see that the @xmath19 must be linearly dependent .",
    "this completes the proof @xmath41 .",
    "+ an interesting question is whether or not a probe state with maximum schmidt rank can always be used for optimum unambiguous unitary operator discrimination , i.e. for attaining the theoretical minimum probability of inconclusive results . at this time",
    ", the answer to this question is unknown .",
    "we see that to unambiguously discriminate among a set of unitary operators , we require them to be linearly independent .",
    "this prompts us to ask if there is a simple , practical test for the linear independence of a set of unitary operators .",
    "since unitary operators are vectors in a vector space , it is natural to imagine that a general test for the linear independence of vectors can be easily adapted to operators .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "consider , for example , a @xmath43-dimensional vector space @xmath44 endowed with inner product @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two arbitrary vectors in @xmath44 represented in some common orthonormal basis .",
    "the linear independence of an arbitrary set of vectors @xmath48 can be checked by calculating the positive semi - definite gram matrix @xmath49 it is a well - known result from elementary linear algebra that the @xmath50 are linearly independent iff @xmath51 is non - singular .    to apply this to a set of @xmath18 unitary operators @xmath19 acting on @xmath12 , we simply rearrange their components in some fixed basis as the components of corresponding vectors in @xmath52 , having the above inner product . we then find that the inner product of such ` vectorisations ' of two unitaries @xmath53 and @xmath54 is simply @xmath55 .",
    "hence , to determine whether or not the unitary operators @xmath19 are linearly independent , we calculate their gram matrix @xmath56 , whose elements are @xmath57 our condition for the linear independence of these operators is simply that @xmath58 we shall make extensive use of this condition in subsequent sections .",
    "we mention in passing that the gram matrix determinant ( the ` grammian ' ) of a set of quantum states plays an important role in unambiguous quantum state comparison @xcite . if we have a set of similar quantum systems all prepared in unknown pure states",
    ", then one can unambiguously confirm that these states are all different iff their grammian is non - zero .",
    "indeed , the statistics of the optimum measurement for confirming this , which separates the antisymmetric and non - antisymmetric subspaces of the systems , directly measure the grammian .    in this article",
    ", we will be concerned with unambiguous discrimination among quantum oracle operators . as we shall see in the next section ,",
    "the standard quantum oracle operators corresponding to functions with fixed domain and range form an abelian group and thus mutually commute .",
    "the following theorem shows that initial entanglement can not help us discriminate among commuting unitary operators : +    [ commute ] if a set of unitary operators @xmath19 mutually commute , then for any possibly entangled probe state @xmath59 , one can produce the corresponding output states @xmath60{0.3ex}{0.1ex}}}}_{a})|{\\psi}_{qa}{\\rangle}$ ] in an alternative manner by preparing the systems @xmath10 and @xmath13 initially in a product probe state @xmath61 , following which one of the @xmath19 acts on @xmath10 and then finally @xmath10 and @xmath13 interact via some unitary operator @xmath62 acting on @xmath29 which is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "+    * proof * : consider a set of unitary operators @xmath19 acting on @xmath12 . if these commute",
    ", then they can be simultaneously diagonalised and therefore written as @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are real and the set @xmath65 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath34 .",
    "the systems @xmath10 and @xmath13 are initially prepared in the probe state @xmath24 , which may be entangled .",
    "we can write this state as @xmath66 is an orthonormal basis set for @xmath15 . the coefficients @xmath67 satisfy @xmath68 .",

    "crucially , the gram matrix of this set of states has the elements @xmath70 here , we have defined @xmath71 clearly , we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for any @xmath74 satisfying these two conditions",
    ", consider instead preparing the initial product state @xmath75 where @xmath76 is an arbitrary normalised state in @xmath36 .",
    "suppose that we had started with this state rather than the state @xmath24 .",
    "then , upon application of @xmath19 , we would have obtained @xmath77 where @xmath78 let us now calculate the elements of the gram matrix of these states .",
    "we obtain @xmath79 which are equal to the gram matrix elements in eq .",
    "for the possibly entangled probe state @xmath24 .",
    "two sets of states with the same gram matrix can be unitarily transformed into each other @xcite .",

    "this proves that entanglement with an ancilla gives no advantage in attempting to discriminate among commuting unitary operators @xmath41 .",
    "+ notice that the applicability of the above result is not limited to unambiguous discrimination .",
    "it applies to every unitary operator discrimination strategy including , e.g. minimum error discrimination .",
    "it also applies to estimation strategies where the index @xmath23 labels the possible values of one or more parameters to be estimated .",
    "indeed , if necessary , it is a straightforward matter to replace @xmath23 with one or more continuous indices .",
    "doing so provides an alternative method of arriving at the main conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the above theorem has the following consequences :    if @xmath18 commuting unitary operators acting on a @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space can be unambiguously discriminated , then @xmath81    * proof * : this is a simple consequence of the fact that we can always neglect the ancilla @xmath13 and concentrate on @xmath10 and that at most @xmath11 states in @xmath12 can be linearly independent and therefore unambiguously discriminated @xmath41 .",
    "+    if @xmath18 commuting unitary operators @xmath19 acting on a @xmath11-dimensional hilbert space can be unambiguously discriminated , then this can always be achieved using any probe state in @xmath12 which is a maximal superposition of the ( common ) eigenstates of the @xmath19 .    * proof * : any such state of @xmath10 can be written as @xmath82 for some angles @xmath83 and where @xmath84 .",

    "nevertheless , the fact that the above scenario is possible leads to the following question : are there functions among which we can never discriminate classically , yet for which the corresponding standard oracle operators are unambiguously distinguishable ?    to be precise about what we mean by functions among which we can never discriminate classically , we shall employ the following :    consider a set of functions @xmath128 .",
    "this set is totally indistinguishable iff , for any @xmath220 and for any function @xmath146 , there a function @xmath221 , where @xmath222 , such that @xmath223 .",

    "this shows that two distinct functions can not be totally indistinguishable .    in the case of three functions @xmath230 and",
    "@xmath231 , for these functions to be distinct , there must exist @xmath125 such that @xmath232 and @xmath233 are not all equal .",

    "in each occupied line there must be at least two of them .",
    "we are led by this observation to the following graphical representation of the functions in @xmath145 .",

    "nevertheless , the fact that we require a specific kind of probe state implies that this does not lead to any general conclusions relating to the comparison of the distinguishability properties of both types of oracle operator .",
    "[ sec:9 ]    the aim of the present article has been to investigate the possibility of unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators .",
    "our motivation for this comes primarily from quantum computation , where the oracle identification problem plays a key role . in most existing treatments of this problem ,",
    "the measurement which is used to identify the oracle operator is taken to be a simple projective measurement .",
    "unambiguous measurements are more powerful and allow to us discriminate in an error - free manner among non - orthogonal states . as a result",
    ", a considerable amount of attention has been given to them in recent years .",
    "the basic theory of unambiguous state discrimination is now highly - developed @xcite and such measurements have been frequently applied to problems in quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "the related problem of unitary operator discrimination , which has been our main concern here , is also beginning to play an important role in this field @xcite .",
    "as such , an interesting question is whether or not such measurements have a similarly useful role to play in relation to the other main aspect of applied quantum information science , which is quantum computation .",
    "since the acquisition of classical information during , or at the end , of a quantum computation often takes place as the result of an oracle query , the possibility of unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators seems to be the most natural place to start investigating the applicability of this type of measurement to this field .",
    "our emphasis has not been on the details of the measurements required to perform unambiguous oracle operator discrimination .",
    "these are unambiguous state discriminating measurements tailored to the particular set of oracle operators and to the probe state which has been prepared . as such",
    ", one can apply the numerous results already established in relation to the construction of these measurements @xcite .",
    "however , in the context of quantum computation , it would be desirable to have an understanding of the complexity of such measurements . here",
    ", we have focused mainly on the problem of determining whether or not a given set of oracle operators can be unambiguously discriminated with some such measurement .",
    "logically , this is the most fundamental problem in relation to this topic .",
    "however , as we hope to have demonstrated in this article , it is extremely rich and its solutions for various cases yield new insights into , for example , existing quantum algorithms , such as in our discussion of unambiguous discrimination among the grover oracle operators .",
    "this article only serves as an initial investigation into unambiguous oracle operator discrimination .",
    "there are undoubtedly intriguing new things to be discovered in relation to the problem of determining whether or not a given set of oracle operators are unambiguously distinguishable .",
    "of particular significance are situations where such discrimination represents a non - classical effect . in section [ sec:6 ]",
    ", we considered unambiguous oracle operator discrimination where the corresponding functions possess the property of total indistinguishability , i.e. they can never be discriminated classically .",
    "we obtained some quite general results in relation to this matter .",
    "two of these were constraints , namely the simple fact that there must be at least four functions in a totally indistinguishable set of distinct functions and that for a finite set of such functions on a boolean domain , the standard oracle operators are never unambiguously distinguishable .",
    "we then gave a complete description of sets of four totally indistinguishable functions with unambiguously distinguishable standard oracle operators .",
    "one point that should be made about the latter two results is that although we took the domain and range of the set of functions to be @xmath358 and @xmath287 respectively , one can easily verify that the proofs are somewhat insensitive to this .",
    "we can , for example , straightforwardly generalise the domain and range to sets of arbitrary , finite , complex numbers whose cardinalities are the same as the original integer sets with the main conclusions unchanged .",
    "this generalisation is essentially minor .",
    "there are , however , significant , non - trivial open problems in relation to such sets of functions and their corresponding oracle operators .",
    "a natural one to pose is : can a complete characterisation of such sets of functions , such as we performed for those with cardinality four in section vi.c , be carried out for larger numbers of functions ?",
    "we expect that in general , the function matrix , in particular the frequencies with which certain column types occur , will play the same , important role that it did in our analysis of the case of four functions .",
    "this seems to be assured by the fact that the matrix @xmath139 is constructed by counting coincidences in these columns .",
    "however , for larger numbers of functions , there is the inevitable problem of obtaining analytically the determinants of high dimensional matrices and being able to make general statements about classes of such determinants .",
    "a further complicating factor when considering larger sets of totally indistinguishable functions is the apparent need to obtain a description of all possible column types . in the four function case , the boolean nature of the elements of these columns makes this straightforward .",
    "this property can also be seen to hold for five functions .",
    "however , we do not have this luxury for larger sets of functions .    a further issue to address",
    "is the potential applicability of sets of totally distinguishable functions with unambiguously distinguishable oracle operators .",
    "can this intriguing , non - classical effect serve as the basis for novel quantum protocols ?",
    "the simple example we gave in eqs . - relates to searching .",
    "however , we suspect that the scope for applications of such sets of functions extends far beyond this and deserves to be explored .    in this article , we have considered many issues which relate to , or ensue from the unambiguous oracle operator discrimination condition . however , there are a large number of questions that we have either not , or have barely addressed .",
    "principal among these , we believe , is the problem of optimal unambiguous oracle operator discrimination .",
    "if it is possible to unambiguously discriminate among a particular set of oracle operators , then what is the maximum probability of success ?",
    "indeed , how do the distinguishability properties of the standard and minimal oracle operators compare ?",
    "for @xmath234 , the standard and entanglement - assisted minimal oracle operators corresponding to permutations are related by a bilateral unitary transformation and so we can see that in this case , both sets of operators are equally distinguishable .",
    "however , such transformations are not possible for @xmath184 . indeed here",
    ", the minimal oracle operators do not mutually commute and so theorem [ commute ] does not apply to them .",
    "there is then the possibility that optimal unambiguous discrimination among a set of such operators requires the use of an entangled probe state .",
    "this may be of some relevance to what we regard as being the main question here , which is : for a given set of permutations , which kind of oracle operators , the standard or entanglement - assisted minimal oracle operators , have the higher unambiguous discrimination success probability ?",
    "indeed , for any set of permutations in @xmath318 and for any integer @xmath184 , if the oracle operators are unambiguously distinguishable , then are the entanglement - assisted minimal oracle operators always more distinguishable than the standard oracle operators , or perhaps vice versa ?    a further open problem is whether or not the framework we have developed in this article can be generalised in a simple and useful way to unambiguous discrimination among sets of oracle operators . as we described in the introduction , many important quantum algorithms involve discrimination among sets of oracle operators , rather than fine - grained discrimination among the oracle operators themselves . as such , there may exist circumstances where we have a set of oracle operators which are not individually unambiguously distinguishable , but where we only require that certain subsets of this total set can be unambiguously discriminated from each other .",
    "when this is the case , we are not actually interested in unambiguous discrimination among the individual oracle operators .",
    "rather , we are concerned with unambiguous discrimination among more general quantum operations , where each operation is a mixture of the oracle operators in each subset .",
    "it is possible that the recent results of wang and ying @xcite relating to unambiguous discrimination among general quantum operations are applicable to this problem .",
    "finally , we shall describe what we regard as being the most pressing open questions concerning unambiguous oracle operator discrimination with multiple calls .",
    "although this article has focused mainly on a single call to the oracle , in section [ sec:7 ] , we did consider multiple parallel calls and obtained a sufficient condition on the number of such calls to enable unambiguous standard oracle operator discrimination for a given set of functions .",
    "is it possible to move forward in this direction by , for example , providing a tighter sufficient condition and/or a suitably non - trivial necessary condition ? there is also the obvious generalisation to non - parallel calls to be considered .",
    "this leads us to what we may term the unambiguous query complexity problem , which we may state in the following way : for a given set of functions @xmath359 , how many uses of the standard oracle operators , interspersed with arbitrary unitary operators and making use of ancillas , are sufficient to produce a set of linearly independent output states for some probe state ? this is equivalent to the requirement that the corresponding products of multiple oracle and arbitrary unitary operators , with the latter being independent of the functions under consideration , are linearly independent .    to conclude , unambiguous discrimination among oracle operators is an important potential application of unambiguous discrimination measurements to quantum computation .",
    "in this article , we have laid the foundations for the further exploration of this possibility .",
    "however , much progress remains to be made before we have a full understanding of the scope and limitations of unambiguous discrimination within this context .",
