    "<S> a universal schema for diagonalization was popularized by n. s. yanofsky ( 2003 ) in which the existence of a ( diagonolized - out and contradictory ) object implies the existence of a fixed - point for a certain function . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that many self - referential paradoxes and diagonally proved theorems can fit in that schema . here </S>",
    "<S> , we fit more theorems in the universal schema of diagonalization , such as euclid s theorem on the infinitude of the primes and new proofs of g. boolos ( 1997 ) for cantor s theorem on the non - equinumerosity of a set with its powerset . then , in linear temporal logic , we show the non - existence of a fixed - point in this logic whose proof resembles the argument of yablo s paradox . </S>",
    "<S> thus , yablo s paradox turns for the first time into a genuine mathematico - logical theorem in the framework of linear temporal logic . </S>",
    "<S> again the diagonal schema of the paper is used in this proof ; and also it is shown that g. priest s inclosure schema ( 1997 ) can fit in our universal diagonal / fixed - point schema . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the existence of dominating ( ackermann - like ) functions ( which dominate a given countable set of functions  like primitive recursives ) using the schema .    </S>",

    "<S> let us note that the function @xmath19 obtained in the proof of theorem  [ ack ] is computable ( intuitively ) and so recursive ( by church s thesis ) ; one can show directly that the above function @xmath19 is recursive ( without appealing to church s thesis ) by some detailed work through recursion theory ( cf . </S>",
