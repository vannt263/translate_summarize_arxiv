    "the type 1 seyfert galaxy  has in recent years been the subject of intense study owing to the discovery by the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( ) of a resolved , broad iron k@xmath13 fluorescent line in its hard x - ray spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of the line is consistent with a gravitationally and doppler shifted emission line which originates from near the inner edge of an accretion disk around a black hole . in the x - rays ,",
    "is also one of the brighter and more variable type 1 seyferts .",
    "it is therefore hoped that by examining the correlated variability between the ionizing x - ray continuum and various components of the fe k@xmath13 line , one can obtain a size scale for the system and thence a mass for the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "this requires , however , that the various components of the line be spectrally resolved on time scales shorter than the intrinsic response time scale of the line - emitting material .    at present , , _ bepposax _ , and _",
    "chandra _ are the only x - ray telescopes with the spectral resolution to measure fluxes in different line components separately .",
    "unfortunately , the integration times ( @xmath14ks ) required to obtain this resolution are longer than the light travel time across the inner edge of an accretion disk around a @xmath15 schwarzschild black hole .",
    "furthermore , the fits to the iron line appear to require a kerr geometry ( although see @xcite ) in order to explain the broad red wing of the line and the lack of significant emission blueward of 6.4kev , thus making the relevant time scales even shorter .",
    "nonetheless , over longer time scales ,  has measured significant variability in the shape of the   fe  k@xmath13 line ( @xcite ) .",
    "time - resolved spectral investigations ( @xcite ) suggest that the broad and narrow components of the iron line are correlated differently with the flux state depending on the time scale investigated . for integrations @xmath16s ,",
    "the narrow component varies with the continuum flux whilst the broad component appears to be anti - correlated .",
    "in contrast , on shorter time scales the broad component responds immediately to flux changes whilst the narrow component remains constant",
    ". suggest that multiple , localized x - ray flares occur on the disk surface near the inner edge and illuminate only a relatively small region of the disk .",
    "these small regions make contributions to narrow ranges in line redshift and thus produce very complex temporal behavior .    in support of this interpretation , consider the iron line associated with a very short , bright flare from  observed during 1997 august by  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] ) .",
    "the line was very redshifted and had little or no emission blueward of 6kev .",
    "its shape was consistent with having originated entirely from a small region at @xmath17 on the approaching side of the disk .",
    "the flare lasted about 4ks , which is also approximately the orbital period at this radius for a @xmath18 black hole . in order for the line",
    "not to be significantly more smeared by the orbital motion , estimate a black hole mass of @xmath19 .",
    "alternatively , they suggest that a much lower mass is possible if all the line emission arises from @xmath20 .    a major complication that a high - mass model faces is the large amplitude and rapid x - ray variability of  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] ) . in particular , during the performance verification phase of , noted that the 0.510kev flux increased by a factor 1.5 over 100s , i.e. , the dynamical time scale at the inner disk edge surrounding a maximal kerr , @xmath21 black hole .",
    "typically one expects the bulk of the x - ray variability to occur on dynamical time scales or longer .",
    "it is clearly important to determine whether this variability represented a rare , rapid event or if such time scales are truly characteristic of the behavior of .",
    "one might expect that characteristic time scales should scale with the mass of the central object ( see , e.g. , the discussions of @xcite and @xcite ) ; therefore , in this work we try to gauge the size of the system and the mass of the black hole in  by studying its characteristic x - ray variability properties in comparison to other black hole systems such as  and .",
    "for the high - frequency variability analysis , we use the 1997 august simultaneous /_rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( ) observation discussed by ( see also @xcite ) . in our analysis",
    "we screen the  data as outlined by , except that we use the more stringent criteria of 7  gev / c for the rigidity and an elevation angle of @xmath22 .",
    "data from both sis detectors are combined into a single lightcurve . for the  data",
    ", we use screening criteria and analysis techniques appropriate for faint sources , as we have previously discussed in .",
    "specifically , we only analyze top layer data from proportional counter units 0 , 1 , and 2 .",

    "@xcite ) on  with a mean count rate of 0.44cps in the 1.312.2kev band . currently , there is a 0.1 cps uncertainty in the zero level offset , as well as comparable magnitude systematic time - dependent variations due to , for example , the solar angular position relative to the source ( remillard 1999 , priv .",

    "- ray variability of  is therefore problematic .",
    "efforts are currently underway , however , to revise the  data reduction process in order to minimize such systematic effects ( remillard 1999 , priv .",
    "comm . ) ; therefore , an ultra - low frequency variability study of  in principle will be feasible in the near future .",
    "we are able , however , to investigate the high - frequency power spectral density ( psd ) of  by using the  815kev and the   0.52kev lightcurves binned on 4096sec time scales .",
    "both lightcurves contain data gaps , especially on the orbital time scale of @xmath24ks due to blockage by the earth and passage through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "we therefore use the techniques of and to calculate the psd , and we only consider frequencies @xmath25hz ( evenly sampled in intervals of the inverse of the observation duration ) .",
    "higher time resolution lightcurves showed excess power on the @xmath24ks orbital time scale .",
    "the results , binned over the greater of four contiguous frequency bins or logarithmically over @xmath26 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] .",
    "here we use a one - sided normalization where integrating over positive frequencies yields the total mean square variability relative to the squared mean for the particular lightcurve being analyzed .",
    "the  lightcurve shows 28% rms variability , whereas the  lightcurve shows 16% rms variability .",
    "both psd have comparable shapes , i.e. , flat from @xmath27@xmath3hz and slightly steeper than @xmath28 at higher frequencies .",
    "we have fit a broken power law to the data , assuming error bars equal to the average psd value divided by the square root of the number of frequency bins averaged over .",
    "although such error estimates are only valid for averages made from independent frequency bins ( which is not strictly true for the lomb - scargle periodogram ; @xcite ) , this should provide a rough estimate , especially as the lightcurves are nearly evenly sampled .",
    "the best fit psd slopes are @xmath29 for the  and @xmath30 for  ( errors are @xmath31 ) .",
    "the break frequencies are found to be @xmath32hz for the , and @xmath33hz for .",
    "these break frequencies are consistent with the value found by .    at frequencies",
    "@xmath34hz there are enough contiguous data segments to be able to calculate the psds using standard fft methods ( @xcite , and extensive references therein ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] we show the calculated , background and noise - subtracted , psd for the 1.83.6kev and 815kev  bands . below @xmath35hz , where signal to noise is greatest , both psds are consistent with being @xmath36 and having 6% rms variability . from the generated background lightcurves",
    ", we estimate that background fluctuations contribute at most 1.5% and 2% rms variability , respectively , to these psds at @xmath37hz .",
    "as the psds of the background lightcurves tend to be slightly steeper than @xmath38 , there may be some trend for background fluctuations to steepen the observed high - frequency psds , and , in fact , find a slightly flatter ( @xmath39 ) high - frequency psd for .",
    "in order to examine time delays between the low energy  lightcurve and the high energy  lightcurve , we use the z - transformed discrete cross - correlation function ( zdcf ) of , which is based upon the dcf method of .",
    "auto - correlation functions can also be computed by this procedure , and we note that psd derived from autocorrelations calculated via the zdcf yield identical results to those presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] .",
    "we use the monte carlo methods described by to assess the significance of any uncertainties due to flux measurement errors as well as uneven or incomplete sampling .",
    "we have previously applied these methods to a simultaneous _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( ) //",
    "observation of   ( @xcite ) , where we found evidence for the low energy  band leading the high energy  band by 5ks .",
    "the results for the   data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] , for which we have used lightcurves binned at 512s resolution .",
    "a positive delay indicates that the   light curve lags the  light curve . due to the ambiguities associated with interpreting cross - correlation results , particularly for such small delays , we considered three different measures of the `` lag '' . for each monte carlo trial",
    ", we estimate the characteristic lag by ( 1 ) fitting a parabola to the zdcf values to find the location of the peak , ( 2 ) computing the centroid of the zdcf over positive values bracketing the maximum value , and ( 3 ) using the location of the actual maximum value of the zdcf . in all three cases ,",
    "our simulations yield evidence for a positive lag at various degrees of significance : @xmath40ks , @xmath41ks , @xmath42 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "although the fitted peak estimate is consistent with a positive lag , both the centroid and zdcf - maximum estimates are formally consistent with zero giving an upper limit of @xmath43ks .    at high fourier frequency",
    ", we have used the 1.83.6kev and 815kev  lightcurves discussed above to search for frequency - dependent time lags using standard fft techniques .",
    "( a complete discussion of such methods , including calculation of error bars , is presented in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "no significant time delays were found , and the 1-@xmath44 upper limits were 50100s in the @xmath45@xmath46hz range .",
    "note that there were an insufficient number of uninterrupted , strictly simultaneous /   lightcurves to allow calculation of their relative time delays via direct fft methods .",
    "the  psd breaks to being @xmath47 at @xmath48hz , and then breaks to being approximately @xmath49 between @xmath7@xmath8hz .",
    "this is to be compared to the  psd which has a comparable rms amplitude and shape , and has a set of psd breaks at frequencies between 0.030.3hz and 110hz ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the black hole mass in  is estimated to be @xmath50 ( @xcite ) ; therefore , if these break frequencies scale with mass , then the central black hole mass of  could be as low as @xmath51 . , which is believed to have a central black hole mass of @xmath52 ( @xcite ) , shows a similar psd with break frequencies at @xmath53hz and between @xmath54@xmath55hz ( @xcite ) . again ,",
    "if the break frequencies scale with mass , then the central black hole mass for  could be several orders of magnitude lower than that for .    to date",
    ", the most carefully studied x - ray psd for any agn is that for ngc  3516 ( @xcite ) .",
    "( see also @xcite who present preliminary results for a number of agn , including . ) for ngc  3516 the psd was seen to break from nearly flat at @xmath56hz , and then gradually steepen into an @xmath57 power law up to frequencies as high as @xmath58hz .",
    "ngc  3516 is seen to be intermediate between  and .",
    "based upon these measurements ( and upon other factors , such as the source luminosity ) , argue for a black hole mass in the range of @xmath59@xmath52 , i.e. , intermediate to the masses of ngc  5548 and  discussed above .",
    "the /  lag upper limit for  is also intermediate between the observed x - ray lags for  ( @xcite ) and ngc  5548 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time lag observed in ngc  5548 , effectively measured on the @xmath38 portion of its psd , is 5ks .",
    "time lags on the flat portion of the  psd could be considerably longer ( @xcite ) .",
    "near the psd break from flat to @xmath28 , the x - ray time lags in  are @xmath60s , whilst on the @xmath38 portion of the psd the x - ray time lags are @xmath8@xmath9s .",
    "the  time lags may cover a similar dynamic range from @xmath61ks ( overall lag ) to @xmath62s ( high frequency lag ) .",
    "if the characteristic variability and lag times are indicative of mass , then a mass as low as @xmath51 may be required for the central black hole of . assuming a bolometric luminosity of @xmath63 ( @xcite )",
    ", this would imply that  is emitting at @xmath64 of its eddington rate , which is large but still plausible .",
    "a relatively low central black hole mass would make the large amplitude , rapid variability reported by much easier to understand , whereas a mass as large as the @xmath65 , the upper end discussed by , seems very unlikely .",
    "the @xmath66s lags seen at high frequency then likely provide an upper limit to the compton diffusion time scale ( see the discussion of @xcite ) .",
    "these time scales are problematic for future hopes of simultaneously temporally and spectrally resolving the iron k@xmath13 line in this system with _ constellation - x _ as it will require @xmath67ks integration times to study the line profile of   ( @xcite ) .",
    "a 30% eddington luminosity indicates that it is worthwhile to search for ultra - low frequency ( @xmath23hz ) variability in excess of @xmath68 rms , that is , above an extrapolation of the flat part of the  and -  psds .",
    "` very high state ' , i.e. , @xmath69 , galactic black hole candidates can show psds that are flat below @xmath70hz , are approximately proportional to @xmath38 psd between @xmath70@xmath71hz , are flat again between @xmath72@xmath73hz , and then break into an @xmath38 psd at higher frequencies .",
    "( specifically , see fig .",
    "4b of @xcite , which shows a ` very high state ' psd of gx339@xmath744 . )",
    "the low frequency portion of the ` very high state ' psd has no simple analogy in the ( usually observed ) low / hard state of , where ultra - low frequency noise is typically associated with dipping activity due to obscuration by the accretion stream ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous models , for example , have associated ` very high state ' low - frequency variability with fluctuations of a viscously unstable @xmath13-disk ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this highlights the major caveat that needs to be mentioned ; we do not know the average psd shape nor the scaling of the break frequencies as a function of fractional eddington luminosity in either galactic black hole candidates or agn .",
    "this is an especially important consideration as the mass estimates discussed above imply a large range of eddington luminosity ratios .",
    "considering all the evidence for rapid variability and extremely short time lags in  discussed above , however , a low mass for   seems to us very compelling . with the advent of the _ x - ray multiple mirror _ ( _ xmm _ ) mission , which has large effective area and is capable of extremely long , uninterrupted observations",
