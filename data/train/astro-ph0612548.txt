    "the physical origin of the enigmatic gamma - ray bursts is still under debate today , 40 years after their discovery ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "the possible detection of radiation in the very high energy region ( extending between few tens of gev and few tens of tev ) will lead to a deeper understanding of the acceleration mechanisms and the emission processes from gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission observed by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) in some case extends up to the vhe band @xcite , favouring the hypothesis of a highly relativistic source of non - thermal radiation situated in an optically thin region @xcite ; more insight , however , can be gained by a clear signal detection in the vhe region , or the evaluation of stringent upper limit in this energy band .",
    "several observations of grbs at energies above 100 gev have been attempted @xcite , without showing any indication of a signal .",
    "this is due to relatively low sensitivity , as in satellite - borne detectors , or to high energy thresholds , as in the previous generation of cherenkov telescopes or in particle detector arrays .",
    "only few tentative detections of radiation above 0.1  tev were reported by milagrito for grb  970417a @xcite and by the grand array on grb  971110  @xcite .",
    "upper limits on the prompt or delayed emission of grbs were also set by whipple @xcite , milagro @xcite , stacee @xcite and hegra - airobicc @xcite .",
    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iact ) of the latest generation achieve a better flux sensitivity and a lower energy threshold , and thus are better suited to detect vhe @xmath0-rays ; on the other hand , their small fields of view permit unguided observations only by virtue of serendipitous detection , and they have to rely on an external trigger , such as that provided by automated satellite link to the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) , which broadcasts the coordinates of events triggered and selected by dedicated satellite detectors .    among the new cherenkov telescopes , magic @xcite is best suited for the detection of the prompt emission of grbs , because of its low energy threshold , large effective area and , in particular , its capability for fast slewing @xcite .",
    "the low trigger threshold , currently 50  gev at zenith , should allow the observation of grbs even at large redshift , as lower energy radiation can effectively reach earth without interacting much with the mrf .",
    "moreover , in its fast - slewing mode , magic can be repositioned within 30  s to any position on the sky ; in case of a target - of - opportunity alert by gcn , an automated procedure takes only few seconds to terminate any pending observation , validate the incoming signal , and start slewing toward the grb position . up to now",
    ", the current maximal repositioning time is @xmath1  s. in two cases , this allowed to put upper limits on the grb flux even during the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "the detection of vhe radiation from the grb is important for comparing different theoretical models .",
    "the emission in the gev - tev range in the prompt and delayed phase is predicted by several authors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "possible processes comprise leptonic and hadronic models : inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering by electrons in internal @xcite or external shocks @xcite , ic in the afterglow shocks @xcite , ic by electrons responsible for optical flashes @xcite , and pure electron - synchrotron @xcite ; proton - synchrotron emission @xcite , photon - pion production @xcite , and neutron cascades @xcite .    during the early afterglow phase",
    ", the recent observations by the swift satellite of x - ray flares lasting @xmath2  s @xcite suggested an extended activity in the central engine of the grb , and thus emission from late internal shocks @xcite or from refreshed shocks due to energy injections at later time @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the energy release of these flares can be of the same order of magnitude of the energy release in the prompt phase , as reported for grb  050502b .",
    "possibility of correlated @xmath0-ray emission extending into the gev - tev region is predicted as well , where the corresponding vhe flares are predicted to originate from ic scattered photons in the forward shock @xcite .",
    "thus , observation of the delayed activity is of particular interest being in most cases not constrained by the alerting and slewing time , and being still connected to the investigation of the central engine dynamics .",
    "measurements in this energy range can be used to test all these competing models . however , as most of the observed grbs occur at large redshift , strong attenuation of the vhe @xmath0-ray flux is expected , as a result of the interaction with low energy photons of the mrf @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the redshift , therefore , is important for a precise interpretation @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we report on the analysis of data collected on several grbs followed by magic during their prompt emission and early afterglow phases .",
    "the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope @xcite , located on the canary island of la  palma ( 2200 m asl , 28@xmath345@xmath4  n ,",
    "17@xmath354@xmath4  w ) , completed its commissioning phase in early fall 2004 .",
    "magic is currently the largest iact , with a 17  m diameter tessellated reflector dish consisting of 964 0.5  @xmath5  0.5  m@xmath6 diamond - milled aluminium mirrors . in its current configuration ,",
    "the magic photo - multiplier camera has a trigger region of @xmath7 diameter  @xcite , and a trigger collection area for @xmath0-rays of the order of @xmath8  m@xmath6 , which increases further with the zenith angle of observation .",
    "presently , the accessible trigger energy range spans from 50 - 60  gev ( at small zenith angles ) to tens of tev .",
    "the magic telescope is focused to 10 km distance  the most likely height at which a 50  gev @xmath0-ray shower has its maximum .",
    "the accuracy in reconstructing the direction of incoming @xmath0-rays , the point spread function ( psf ) , is about @xmath9 , slightly depending on the analysis .",
    "the reconstructed signals are calibrated  @xcite , and then cleaned of spurious backgrounds from the light of the night sky using two different image cleaning procedures : one algorithm requiring signal exceeding fixed reference levels , and a second algorithm employing additionally the reconstructed information of the arrival time  @xcite .",
    "non - physical background images are eliminated ( e.g.  car flashes having triggered the readout ) .",
    "events are processed by means of the magic standard analysis software  @xcite , using the standard hillas analysis  @xcite .",
    "gamma / hadron separation is performed by means of the random forest ( rf ) method @xcite , a classification method that combines several parameters describing the shape of the image into a new parameter called _ hadronness _",
    "@xcite , the final @xmath0/hadron discriminator in our analysis .",
    "monte carlo samples are used to optimize , as a function of energy , the cuts in hadronness .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0-ray is also estimated using a rf approach , yielding a resolution of @xmath10 at @xmath11 . the parameter _ alpha _ of the hillas analysis , which is related to the direction of the incoming shower , is not included in the calculation of hadronness , as it is used separately to evaluate the significance of a signal .",
    "if the telescope is directed at a point - like @xmath0-ray source , as a grb is expected to be , the alpha - distribution of collected photons should peak at @xmath12 , while it is uniform for isotropic background showers .",
    "on 2005 october 11 at 02:17:37  ut , the integral satellite announced grb  051011 at the position j2000 , .",
    "a few hours later , integral sent a new gcn @xcite stating that grb  051011 was in fact the crab nebula .",
    "thus , in a blind test , we acquired 2814 seconds of events coming from the crab nebula , the standard source of @xmath0-rays at vhe energies .",
    "the analysis yielded a @xmath13 signal above 350 gev @xcite , showing that magic can observe , at @xmath14 level , spectra of 5 crab units ( 1 c.u .",
    "@xmath15 above 100  gev ) of intensity in 40  s , if above 300  gev , and in 90  s if below 300  gev .",
    "an automatic alert system has been operational from july 15@xmath16 , 2004 . since then , about 200 grbs were detected by hete - ii , integral and swift , out of which about 100 contained grb coordinates .",
    "time delays to the onset of the burst were of the order of several seconds to tens of minutes . during the first magic data cycle , between april 2005 and march",
    "2006 , 9 grbs were observed by magic during the prompt or the early afterglow emission phase , as listed in table  [ tab : list ] . in two cases",
    "the prompt alerting by the gcn and the fast reaction of the magic telescope allowed to take data not only on the early afterglow , but also on part of the prompt emission of the burst .",
    "these two bursts are grb  0507013a and grb  050904 and will be considered separately    .[tab : list ] summary of grbs observed by magic from april 2005 to march 2006 .",
    "@xmath17 stands here for the time delay after @xmath18 until the burst coordinates were received from the gcn .",
    "@xmath19 is the total time delay before the observation could be started , of which @xmath20 is the time lost for repositioning the telescope .",
    "data column shows the total amount of data taken . [ cols=\">,<,^,>,>,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "a preliminary estimate of the observability of grbs by the magic telescope had originally been derived using the fourth batse catalogue @xcite .",
    "the grb spectra were extended to gev energies with a simple power law and using the observed high - energy spectral index .",
    "the extrapolated fluxes were finally compared to the estimated magic sensitivity .",
    "setting conservative cuts on observation times and significances , and assuming an energy threshold of 30  gev , a 5@xmath21-signal rate of @xmath22 per year was obtained for an assumed observation delay between 15 and 60s and a batse trigger rate of @xmath23360/year .",
    "taking into account the rate of grbs @xcite , and extrapolating grb spectra , as observed by batse , to vhe using an unbroken power law of reasonable power index @xcite , it was foreseen that magic could detect about one grb per year at a @xmath14 level .",
    "a maximal redshift up to @xmath24 was considered .",
    "this estimate must be revised : the swift alert rate is about a factor  2 lower than predicted , and it includes bursts even fainter than those observed by batse ; also , for these bursts the effective magic energy threshold at analysis level was higher than the assumed one ( @xmath25  gev ) ; most important , the distribution of bursts detected by swift has a much higher median redshift than expected . as a result , the number of grbs that magic can detect is now estimated to lie in the range of 0.2 - 0.7 per year .",
    "this number can be expected to increase again with the launch of the glast and agile satellites , and the increased number of alerts due to the grb monitoring by glast , agile and swift altogether .",
    "magic was able to observe part of the prompt and the early afterglow emission phase of many grbs as a response to the alert system provided by several satellites .",
    "no excess events above @xmath26  gev were detected , neither during the prompt emission phase nor during the early afterglow .",
    "we have derived upper limits for the @xmath0-ray flux between 85 and 1000  gev .",
    "these limits are compatible with a naive extension of the power law spectrum , when the redshift is known , up to hundreds of gev .    for the first time",
    "an atmospheric cherenkov telescope was able to perform direct rapid observations of the prompt emission phase of grbs .",
    "this is particulary relevant in the so called `` swift era '' .",
    "although strong absorption of the high - energy @xmath0-ray flux by the mrf is expected at high redshifts , given its sensitivity to low fluxes and its fast slewing capabilities , the magic telescope is currently expected to detect about 0.5 grbs per year , if the grb spectra extend to the energy domain of hundreds of gev , following a power law with reasonable indices .",
    "the construction of the magic telescope was mainly made possible by the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn , and the spanish cicyt , to whom goes our grateful acknowledgement .",
    "we would also like to thank the iac for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma .",
    "this work was further supported by eth research grant th  34/04  3 and the polish mnii grant 1p03d01028 .",
    "the recorded number of events in a particular reconstructed energy bin @xmath27 is :      where @xmath29 is the flux ( ph @xmath30 s@xmath31 gev@xmath31 ) , @xmath32 is the effective area after all cuts , included the reconstructed energy cut @xmath27 , and @xmath33 the total time interval of observation .",
    "it should be noted that the flux @xmath34 and the effective area @xmath35 depend on the _ true _ energy , while the cuts for the selection of the excess events @xmath36 and of the effective area @xmath32 depend on the reconstructed ( estimated ) energy .",
    "the integral is computed in _ true _ energy @xmath37 .        where @xmath39 is a normalization factor ( ph @xmath30 s@xmath31 gev@xmath31 )",
    ", @xmath40 is the average high energy power - law index and @xmath41 the pivot energy ( e.g. 1 gev ) . from equation ( [ eq : excess ] )",
