    "in the past many nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) potentials were constructed , which were supposed to fit the @xmath2 scattering data available at the time of construction .",
    "the older models , from the 1950s and 1960s , are no longer suitable for describing the present set of more numerous and much more accurate data without refitting the parameters . out of the various potential models constructed in the 1970s , the better ones fitted the data with @xmath3 of about 2 , where @xmath4 denotes the number of @xmath2 scattering data available at that time in the 0350 mev energy range .",
    "the potentials constructed in the 1980s have only slightly improved on this in the sense that , although they have been fitted to try to describe the newer and much more accurate data , these models still have @xmath5 .",
    "this number should be compared with @xmath6 , obtained in the recently finished nijmegen @xmath2 multienergy partial - wave analysis  @xcite ( pwa93 ) of all @xmath7 and @xmath0 scattering data below 350 mev . on statistical grounds ,",
    "@xmath8 is about the best one can expect to get in partial - wave analyses or for potential models .    in a recent paper  @xcite , we investigated the quality with respect to the @xmath7 scattering data below 350 mev of a number of @xmath2 potentials that had appeared in the literature .",
    "we found that only a few of the potential models we investigated are of a satisfactory quality .",
    "these models are the reid soft - core potential  @xcite reid68 , the nijmegen soft - core potential  @xcite nijm78 , and the new bonn @xmath7 potential  @xcite bonn89 .",
    "the latter is a readjustment of the momentum - space full bonn potential  @xcite , in order to fit the @xmath7 data .",
    "if we do not consider the very low - energy ( 02 mev ) @xmath7 data , also the parametrized paris potential  @xcite paris80 gives a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that , at present , the best potential models have @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the number of @xmath7 scattering data .",
    "moreover , only models which have explicitly included the @xmath7 data in their fit belong to this category .",
    "potential models which have been fitted only to the @xmath0 data often give a poor description of the @xmath7 data , even after applying the necessary corrections for the coulomb interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated that most @xmath0 potentials unfortunately do not automatically fit the @xmath7 data , a fact which has been generally overlooked .",
    "any @xmath2 potential should be fitted to the @xmath7 data as well as to the @xmath0 data in order to be able to describe all @xmath2 scattering data .    over the last decade",
    "the quality of the @xmath0 data has increased considerably .",
    "consequently , the older potentials ( reid68 , nijm78 , paris80 ) do not fit these data very well . also , the much newer bonn potentials already needed revisions and updates  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present updates of the nijm78 and reid68 potentials , denoted by nijm93 and reid93 , respectively .",
    "because our analysis of the @xmath0 data ( and hence our careful scrutiny of the @xmath0 data ) has only recently been finished  @xcite , we originally constructed an update ( nijm92@xmath7 ) of the nijm78 potential for the @xmath7 data only .",
    "this @xmath7 potential was used in our earlier preliminary @xmath0 analyses  @xcite to parametrize the isovector partial waves .",
    "it has @xmath11 , which is not as good as the nijmegen pwa93",
    ". one can wonder whether it is at all possible to construct a new class of potential models which fit the @xmath2 data with the almost perfect @xmath12 .",
    "the answer turns out to be affirmative .",
    "this could already be surmised from the nijmegen pwa93 , because this analysis is in essence an energy - dependent potential fitted to the scattering data .",
    "( the reason for us using an energy - dependent potential is nothing more than just convenience . ) in the partial - wave analysis we need 39 parameters to reach @xmath13 , whereas a conventional potential model typically has only 1015 free parameters .",
    "it is therefore perhaps not surprising that the 15-parameter update ( nijm93 ) of the nijm78 potential , which fits the @xmath2 data with @xmath14 , can not compete in quality with the nijmegen pwa93 . to obtain a high - quality potential we decided some years ago to follow a different approach .    because the nijm92@xmath7 potential already gives a reasonable description of the @xmath7 data , this model forms the basis for the construction of a high - quality potential , which _ can _ compete with the nijmegen pwa93 .",
    "we adjust in each partial wave separately only a few of the parameters of this potential  @xcite .",
    "this way we will be able to construct a potential model which fits the data with @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting reid - like potential nijm  i gives a very good fit to the data with @xmath15 .",
    "the nijm  i potential contains momentum - dependent terms ( as do the nijm78 and nijm93 potentials ) , which in configuration space give rise to a non - local structure @xmath16 to the potential .",
    "we also constructed a purely local nijm  ii potential , where these momentum - dependent terms were intentionally omitted .",
    "this local potential nijm  ii gives an equally good fit to the data as the non - local potential nijm  i. finally , we constructed a regularized update of the reid68 potential  @xcite , called reid93 .",
    "this reid93 model is also a local potential and fits the scattering data very well .",
    "these latter three potential models are in a sense also alternative partial - wave analyses , because they have roughly the same number of fit parameters as our nijmegen pwa93 , these parameters were fitted to the same database , and the potential models achieve nearly the same values of @xmath17 as the nijmegen pwa93 ( i.e. , close to the expectation value ) .",
    "hence , the differences between , e.g. , the phase parameters of these models provide an indication for the systematic error in the nijmegen partial - wave analyses .    in sec .",
    "[ outline ] we briefly discuss some general features of @xmath2 potentials . in sec .",
    "[ structure ] we give more details regarding the explicit form of the potentials used in this work .",
    "two of these potentials are based on the original nijm78 potential , whereas the third is a regularized update of the reid68 potential in the sense that also in this new model each partial wave is parametrized by a number of yukawa functions . in sec .  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the fitting procedure and the potentials are presented in more detail .",
    "the @xmath2 potential can be described in momentum space and in configuration space .",
    "since it is difficult to solve the full four - dimensional scattering equation , it has become common practice first to make a reduction to a three - dimensional scattering equation .",
    "various choices are possible , and it is important to note that the potential derived within the chosen reduction scheme should _ only _ be used in the scattering equation corresponding to that particular reduction scheme .",
    "these three - dimensional scattering equations can always be written in the form of the momentum - space version of the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "if the kinematics is treated relativistically , this is called the relativistic lippmann - schwinger equation . in configuration space ,",
    "the differential form of this integral equation is the schrdinger equation .",
    "the configuration - space potentials are to be used either in the nonrelativistic or the relativistic schrdinger equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the laplacian , and where ( non)relativistic refers to the kinematics . for nonrelativistic kinematics the relation between the center - of - mass energy @xmath20 and the center - of - mass momentum squared @xmath21 reads @xmath22 , whereas for relativistic kinematics it reads @xmath23 .",
    "the earliest potential models were configuration - space potentials to be used in the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "they were phenomenological or semiphenomenological parameterizations , based on a general form for the potential .",

    "this choice is analogous to the extension of the reid68 potential to the higher partial waves as given by day  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the potential models are optimized by minimizing the @xmath1 in a direct fit to the data .",
    "since the scattering data are spread over a large number of energies ( about 200 different energies for the @xmath7 data and almost 400 different energies for the @xmath0 data in the 0350 mev energy range ) and the phase parameters need to be calculated up to at least @xmath177 , the schrdinger equation then has to be solved a very large number of times .",
    "this approach , therefore , is not very practical when the model parameters do not yet have reasonable values and , consequently , the @xmath1 is still very high .",
    "a more convenient approach is to start with the nijmegen representation  @xcite of the @xmath1 hypersurface of the scattering data .",
    "it is obtained from the 10 single - energy analyses and consists of 10 sets of phase parameters and the error matrix , each at a different energy .",
    "the error matrix is the inverse of half the second - derivative matrix of the @xmath1 hypersurface with respect to the phase parameters up to @xmath178 within the energy bin of the single - energy analysis .",
    "this @xmath1 hypersurface is , in principle , independent of the particular partial - wave analysis . in practice",
    "the representation we use is somewhat dependent on the nijmegen multienergy analysis .",
    "the crucial point is , however , that it provides a very good and concise representation of the scattering data . for each change in the model parameters we need to solve the schrdinger equation for all partial waves up to @xmath178 at only 10 different energies , which allows for a much quicker optimization for the parameters of the potential model .    in the last stage of the fitting procedure",
    "the potential parameters have been further optimized in a very time - consuming direct fit to the data . in this case",
    "we use the potential model in all partial waves with @xmath179 , whereas in the higher partial waves we include ope only .",
    "the final @xmath180 of the potential should be obtained from this direct comparison with the experimental data .",
    "our first improvement of the nijm78 potential  @xcite was already started several years ago , when we constructed an update to the @xmath7 data of the nijm78 potential .",
    "this potential has been used in the nijmegen analyses  @xcite to parametrize the @xmath0 isovector lower partial waves ( except the @xmath0 @xmath35 ) . in our latest analysis",
    "@xcite ( pwa93 ) we refer to it as the nijm92@xmath7 potential .",
    "we found that a good fit to the @xmath7 data could be obtained using one cutoff parameter @xmath181 mev for all three types of meson exchanges .",
    "some of the coupling constants were not refitted , but were kept at the values of the original nijm78 potential .",
    "the reason is that , when we only fit to the @xmath7 data , we can not incorporate the isospin dependence of the isovector exchanges ( there are only @xmath161 partial waves ) . a direct comparison of this nijm92@xmath7 potential with the @xmath7 data yields @xmath182 for 1787 data , which means @xmath11 .",
    "now that the nijmegen analysis of the @xmath0 data is also finished  @xcite and we have carefully scrutinized the @xmath0 database , we can extend the update of the nijm78 potential to include the fit to the @xmath0 scattering data as well .",
    "this model we refer to as nijm93 .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : reid ] , the @xmath0 @xmath35 partial wave has to be parametrized separately .",
    "the reason is that there is clear evidence for breaking of charge independence in the @xmath35 scattering lengths @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "this difference in scattering lengths carries over into an approximately @xmath185 phase - shift difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath0 @xmath35 phase shifts at higher energies .",
    "this difference can not be explained as being only due to the difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath0 ope potentials . allowing for a different value for the neutral - pion and charged - pion coupling constants does not help either , because the scattering lengths are very insensitive to these kind of changes . to accommodate the @xmath7 and @xmath0 @xmath35 differences ,",
    "we therefore introduce a purely phenomenological breaking of charge independence between the @xmath186 and @xmath187 coupling constants .",
    "this breaking of charge independence is _ only _ assumed in the @xmath35 partial wave ; for all other partial waves the @xmath186 and @xmath187 coupling constants are taken to be the same .",
    "the parameters for the nijm93 potential , rounded to four or five significant figures , can be found in table  [ parnym93 ] , where the meson masses are the masses as listed by the 1990 particle data group  @xcite .",
    "the coupling constants are the values at @xmath188 .",
    "the pion coupling constants are fixed at @xmath189 at the corresponding pion pole @xmath190 or @xmath191 ; hence the different entries for neutral- and charged - pion exchange at @xmath188 .",
    "the @xmath89 and pomeron coupling constants are rather large , whereas the @xmath192 coupling constant is reasonably small . for the @xmath103",
    "coupling constants we find @xmath193 , which is close to the value 3.7 from naive vector - meson dominance of the isovector electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .    for the nijm93 potential we find @xmath194 for 1787 @xmath7 data and @xmath195 for 2514 @xmath0 data .",
    "so for the @xmath7 data @xmath196 , for the @xmath0 data @xmath197 , and for all @xmath2 data @xmath14 .",
    "we find that this 15-parameter conventional meson - exchange potential can not do better than @xmath198 , a result which is also found for similar potential models such as the paris80 and all the bonn potentials .",
    "apparently , the conventional meson - exchange potentials can not compete in quality with the nijmegen pwa93 .",
    "this indicates that these models lack some important physics .      in order to be able to construct a potential model which is of almost the same quality as the nijmegen pwa93 ( @xmath12 )",
    ", we follow a different approach and take advantage of the success of the reid68 potential .",
    "we expect that , when we start with the nijmegen potential ( which already has a reasonable @xmath1 on the @xmath7 data ) , we can construct a reid - like potential where in each partial wave we probably need to adjust only a few parameters in order to arrive at @xmath12 .",
    "the potential forms are then given by a set of slightly adjusted nijmegen potentials , each representing one particular partial wave .",
    "starting with the parameters of the nijm92@xmath7 potential  @xcite , we find that for most partial waves an adjustment of the @xmath128 and @xmath199 coupling constants already gives very good results .",
    "counting all parameters which have been adjusted in the fit of each partial wave , we arrive at a total of 41 parameters .",
    "this should be compared with the 39 parameters used in the nijmegen pwa93 .    in the last stage ,",
    "the parameters of this reid - like potential are optimized in a direct fit to the data .",
    "the potential is then used in all partial waves up to @xmath200 simultaneously .",
    "this model we refer to as nijm  i. it has @xmath201 and @xmath202 , and so @xmath15 on all @xmath7 and @xmath0 scattering data .",
    "we have also constructed a local reid - like nijmegen potential , where we leave out the explicit momentum - dependent terms which give rise to non - local contributions to the configuration - space potential as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ nonlocal ] ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure as for the non - local nijm  i potential .",
    "first , the parameters are adjusted in a fit to the representation of the @xmath1 hypersurface , and then further optimized in a direct fit to the data . for this local potential , denoted by nijm  ii",
    ", we use a total of 47 parameters and we find @xmath201 and @xmath203 , and so @xmath15 .    although these potentials are purely phenomenological ( except for the correct ope tail ) and the coupling constants have no physical meaning , these potentials are the first to give an excellent description of the @xmath2 scattering data .",
    "they have already been used successfully in three- and many - body calculations  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have constructed an updated reid potential based on the original reid68 potential .",
    "this regularized version , denoted by reid93 and discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : reid ] , gives an equally good description of the data as do the nijm  i and nijm  ii potentials .",
    "the 50 phenomenological potential parameters @xmath204 and @xmath205 were fitted to the data , resulting in @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and so also for this potential @xmath15 .",
    "this reid93 potential has been used in a triton calculation as well  @xcite .",
    "the results of the non - local nijm  i potential , the local nijm  ii potential , and the local reid93 potential are summarized in table  [ compare ] .",
    "the results of the nijmegen pwa93 are shown for comparison .",
    "although @xmath3 for these three potentials is already very good , their description of the @xmath0 data is still not as good as the description of these @xmath0 data in the partial - wave analysis .",
    "here we should also mention that we did not do a thorough investigation into the minimum number of parameters required to get these results ( as we did for the partial - wave analysis ) .",
    "the reason is that in order to do this properly , all potential parameters have to be fitted simultaneously to all @xmath2 data .",
    "but we found it more successful to do a large number of fits where in each separate run only a ( completely arbitrary ) subset of the potential parameters was optimized .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility that an equally good fit can be obtained with a few parameters less .    as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "these new potentials ( except nijm93 ) are in a sense alternative partial - wave analyses .",
    "the differences between the phase parameters of the potentials and the phase parameters of the nijmegen pwa93 are shown in tables [ phspp ] and [ phsnp ] .",
    "these differences provide an indication for the systematic error on the results of the nijmegen pwa93 . for the @xmath0 phase parameters the differences at some energies ( especially with the reid93 potential ) are relatively large .",
    "however , one has to bear in mind that @xmath208 of the potential models is still substantially higher than that of the multienergy partial - wave analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation in the mixing parameter @xmath209 is small .",
    "it has often been claimed that this mixing parameter is ill determined and a wide range of values from potential models seemed acceptable ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , in our publication of the nijmegen pwa93 we already argued that @xmath209 is in fact known very accurately .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ epsilon ] , where we note that the results of the nijm  i and nijm  ii models lie essentially within the _ statistical _ uncertainty as obtained in the nijmegen pwa93 . above 150 mev ,",
    "the result of the reid93 model rises too strongly but is still within 2.5 standard deviations of the nijmegen pwa93 .",
    "the potentials between 0 and 2 fm for the singlet , triplet uncoupled , and triplet coupled @xmath0 partial waves are shown in figs .",
    "[ potsin ] , [ potunc ] , and [ potcop ] , respectively . for the non - local potential nijm",
    "i we plot @xmath210 , which more or less represents the effective potential when non - local terms are present ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for coupled channels ,",
    "the potential is a @xmath211 matrix and the @xmath212 and @xmath213 plots in fig .",
    "[ potcop ] represent the off - diagonal elements of the potential .",
    "the main differences between the potentials show up in the inner region , i.e. , for @xmath214 fm .",
    "in general , the non - local nijm  i potential is much softer than the local nijm  ii and reid93 potentials , while the nijm  ii potential is again much softer than the reid93 potential .",
    "the reason for this softness of the nijmegen potentials is the exponential form factor .",
    "finally , all potential models have been fitted to the deuteron binding energy @xmath215 mev  @xcite using relativistic kinematics , i.e. , @xmath216 rather than @xmath217 .",
    "we also constructed versions of the nijm  i and nijm  ii potentials to accommodate the latter nonrelativistic form . in any case",
    "the value @xmath218 mev is exactly reproduced to this accuracy .",
    "some of the other deuteron parameters are listed in table  [ deuter ] .",
    "the different potential models all give very similar results . because we consider the potentials nijm  i , nijm  ii , and reid93 as alternative partial wave analyses , the values of the deuteron parameter @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 given by these potentials are new experimental determinations of these quantities . for the @xmath222-state ratio @xmath219",
    "we find @xmath223 in good agreement with the recent determination by rodning and knutson  @xcite of @xmath224 .",

    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , and references cited therein .",
    "a direct comparison of our value @xmath231 @xmath232 of the deuteron quadrupole moment with the experimental value 0.2859(3 ) @xmath232 of @xcite is only possible after all possible corrections have been accounted for , which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we would like to turn the argument around and suggest that these corrections must obviously be about 0.015  @xmath232 .",
    "it is quite interesting to see that for our best potentials the @xmath233-state probability is @xmath234 .",
    "the deuteron parameters as well as the results for the scattering lengths for both the potential models and the nijmegen pwa93 will be discussed in more detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "these potentials were used  @xcite in calculations of the triton binding energy .",
    "it turned out that all these potentials underbind the triton by roughly 800 kev , a result which can be expected from their @xmath235 values .",
    "in this paper we presented an update nijm93 of the old nijm78 @xmath2 potential .",
    "it contains the correct ope tail and has @xmath14 .",
    "although it can not compete in quality with the nijmegen partial - wave analysis ( a feature apparently all conventional meson - exchange potentials suffer from ) , the description of the @xmath0 data of the new nijm93 model is substantially better than that of the original nijm78 potential , which was fitted to the old 1969 livermore database  @xcite .",
    "here we would also like to point out that in the nijm93 model we do not include two - meson - exchange contributions such as @xmath93 and @xmath236 exchange , and we still get a reasonable description of the @xmath237 and @xmath238 phase shifts .",
    "this in contrast to claims made in the literature  @xcite that this is impossible .",
    "however , this result is obtained at the cost of having a rather large value for the pseudoscalar ( pion ) cutoff mass of @xmath239 mev .",
    "we have also presented three new high - quality @xmath2 potentials .",

    "the nijm  ii potential is a local reid - like potential , and does not contain any explicit momentum - dependent terms .",
    "both potentials fit the @xmath2 scattering data with a nearly optimal @xmath240 .",
    "a regularized update of the reid potential , denoted by reid93 , gives the same excellent @xmath240 .",
