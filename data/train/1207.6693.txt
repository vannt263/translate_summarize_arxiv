    "it is well established that a star is formed by gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core .",
    "the collapsing core is initially optically thin to the thermal emission of dust grains , and undergo isothermal run - away collapse as long as the cooling rate overwhelms the compressional heating .",
    "the isothermal condition breaks down when the central density reaches @xmath010@xmath6 @xmath7 , and the temperature starts rising .",
    "increasing gas pressure decelerates the contraction , and the core come to the hydrostatic equilibrium , which is called a first hydrostatic core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the first core is a transient object , it plays essential roles in determining the physical condition of a protostar ; it fragments and forms binaries @xcite , and drives bipolar molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "when the temperature reaches @xmath02000 k and hydrogen molecules start to dissociate , the central region of the first core collapses again to form the protostar .",
    "star formation processes include both the structure evolution as mentioned above , and molecular evolution .",
    "rates of chemical reactions depend on various physical quantities . among them , the temperature is crucial ; e.g. , rates of ice sublimation and reactions with potential barriers are proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents desorption energy or a height of an energy barrier .",
    "in addition , the molecular evolution in star forming regions is a non - equilibrium process .",
    "therefore , accurate temperature determination via radiation hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations is important to investigate molecular evolution in star forming cores .",
    "there are a few previous works which combined a chemical reaction network model with a rhd model of star - forming cores .",
    "aikawa et al . ( 2008 , here after aw08 ) investigated chemistry from a molecular cloud core to a protostellar core adopting a spherically symmetric rhd model @xcite , and mainly discussed the molecular evolution that occurs at @xmath10 au , where @xmath11 k. the spherical symmetry , however , should brake down inside the centrifugal radius of @xmath0100 au , where circumstellar disks will appear .",
    "@xcite adopted an axis symmetric rhd model @xcite , and investigated molecular evolution mainly at @xmath12 k from a collapsing molecular cloud cores to a forming circumstellar disk .",
    "the spatial resolution of their physical model is @xmath03 au in the central region . so the central",
    "first core and/or protostar is not resolved .    in this paper , we combine a detailed chemical reaction network model of gas - phase and grain - surface chemistry with a three dimensional rhd simulation of a star - forming core for the first time , and investigate molecular evolution at @xmath13 = 102000 k. so far , a few groups have succcessfully performed three - dimensional r(m)hd simulations of a low mass star - forming core up to the first core stage @xcite . on the other hand , evolution beyond first cores in three",
    "dimension is more challenging and investigated only very recently by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "so we focus on chemistry in the first core stage in the present work .",
    "our motivations are twofold .",
    "firstly , first cores are good targets for atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "although over 40 years have passed since @xcite predicted the presence of first cores , they have not yet been detected .",
    "observation of first cores is challenging ; they are buried in dense envelopes , and have very compact structure ( @xmath010 au ) and short lifetime ( a few 1000 yr ) .",
    "recently , some candidates have been reported : irs2e in l1448 @xcite , per - bolo 58 @xcite and l1541-mm @xcite .",
    "observational properties of these objects , low bolometric luminosity @xmath14 @xmath15 and cold spectral energy distribution , are consistent with the theoretical predictions of first cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , irs2e has a high velocity outflow ( @xmath025 km / s ) , and per - bolo 58 is considerably luminous at 24 @xmath16 m and associated with a well - collimated outflow @xcite , which contradict the theoretical prediction that the outflow from first cores is slow ( @xmath175 km / s ) and not well collimated @xcite .",
    "confirmation and further investigations of the candidates require observation of molecular emission lines . therefore , chemical models of first cores are highly desired .",
    "secondly , recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that the outer region of first cores might directly evolve to circumstellar disks , while the central region collapses to form protostars @xcite . in that case",
    ", the chemical composition of the first cores would be the initial composition of the circumstellar disks .",
    "the molecular evolution during the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disks is still an open question .",
    "although most chemical models of the circumstellar disks have used abundances of the molecular cloud cores as initial abundances , its validity is questioned @xcite . in other words , there remains a missing link between chemistry in the molecular cloud cores and the circumstellar disks .",
    "our detailed three - dimensional chemical - hydrodynamical model from the molecular cloud cores to the first cores is the first step to fill the gap .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe our rhd simulations and chemical reaction network model . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss trajectories of fluid parcels in our rhd simulations .",
    "we show molecular evolutions in the assorted fluid parcels , and the spatial distributions of molecular abundances in the first core stage . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss molecular column densities and uncertainties in our reaction network model .",
    "we compare our model with models of hot corinos in terms of physical and chemical properties .",
    "we also discuss the effect of accretion shocks on chemistry , and chemistry after the first core stage .",
    "we summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "physical structure of a collapsing molecular cloud core is calculated using a three - dimensional nested - grid self - gravitational radiation magnetohydrodynamics code , which was developed by @xcite . here",
    "we briefly describe physical parameters and structure of a core .",
    "the self - gravitational magnetohydrodynamics equations are coupled with radiation transfer , which is treated with gray flux - limited diffusion approximation @xcite .",
    "the gas temperature is set to be equal to the dust temperature . in the present work , the magnetic field",
    "is set to zero for simplicity .",
    "idealized equation of state is assumed with the adiabatic index of 5/3 .",
    "the simulation consists of multiple nested - grids in order to achieve higher resolution in the central region .",
    "each level of the nested grids has 64@xmath18 cubic cells in @xmath19 . at the end of the simulation , 13 levels of nested - grids",
    "are generated and the smallest scale corresponds to @xmath00.05 au .",
    "we calculate the evolution of a molecular cloud core with the mass of 1 @xmath20 .",
    "the initial density distribution is given by a critical bonnor - ebert sphere , and enhanced by a factor of 1.6 so that the sphere becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "initially , the central number density of the core is @xmath21 @xmath7 ( @xmath22 g @xmath7 ) . the radius of the cloud core is 6300 au .",
    "the initial angular velocity is @xmath23 s@xmath24 , and the initial temperature is set to 10 k. the simulation is stopped when the maximum temperature reaches 2000 k , at which temperature hydrogen molecules collisionally dissociate , and the second collapse starts .    in this paper , we define the moment when the central gas number density of the core reaches @xmath25 @xmath7 ( @xmath26 g @xmath7 ) as t@xmath27 = 0 ; the first core is born .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the temporal variations of the central gas number density and temperature of the core at t@xmath28 0 .",
    "the temperature and the density increase by two and five orders of magnitude in @xmath03000 yr , respectively , which is the lifetime of the first core in our model . figure [ fig2 ] shows the core structures at @xmath29 yr ( middle stage ) and 2800 yr ( late stage ) .",
    "we present molecular distributions in these two stages in section 3 .",
    "the core is oblate or disk - like because of the rotation . in the panels ( c ) and",
    "( f ) , the dashed lines depict temperature contours of 25 k and 100 k , which are roughly the sublimation temperature of co and large organic molecules , respectively .",
    "as the core evolves from 1500 yr to 2800 yr , the sublimation radii of co and large organic molecules expand from @xmath040 au to @xmath0100 au and from @xmath05 au to @xmath010 au , respectively .",
    "we discuss the physical structures of the core in more detail in section 3.1 .",
    "chemical processes are not included in the hydrodynamic simulation . in this work",
    "we calculate molecular abundances as a post process ; we trace 10@xmath30 fluid parcels in the hydrodynamic simulation , and calculate a chemical reaction network model along 10@xmath31 selected trajectories .",
    "our approach is similar to aw08 and @xcite .",
    "initially , the fluid parcels are distributed spherically at @xmath32 10002500 au .",
    "the parcels follow the local flow at each hydrodynamic time step .",
    "leapfrog integration is used for tracing the parcels , and the physical parameters at the position of the parcels are obtained by the trilinear interpolation . in the calculations of molecular evolution in the fluid parcels ,",
    "the temperature , density , visual extinction , and cosmic - ray ionization rate are updated at each time step along the trajectories ( see also section 2.2.4 ) .",
    "we note that the accretion shock heating layer at the first core surface is not spatially resolved in our model , since the thickness of the layer , @xmath010@xmath33 au @xcite , is smaller than the smallest scale of our calculation .",
    "effect of the shock layer on chemistry is discussed in section 4.4 .",
    "the dynamical evolution covers a wide range of temperature and density : 102000 k and 10@xmath3010@xmath34 @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . to calculate the molecular evolution in these physical conditions , we combine two chemical reaction network models , @xcite and @xcite , as a base of our model .",
    "the former is a gas - grain reaction network model applied to a star - forming core at 10200 k. the latter is a high temperature gas - phase reaction network model , and originally developed for the temperature of 100800 k. the major difference between the two network models is that reactions with a high potential energy barrier are included in the latter model .",
    "for the neutral - neutral reactions and neutral - ion reactions , we switch the rates from the former network to the latter network when the temperature exceeds 100 k. in the following , we describe modifications to gas phase reactions , treatment of gas - grain interactions , and grain - surface reactions in our model . in total , the reaction network consists of 461 gas - phase species ( including dust grains with three different charge states ) and 195 grain - surface species , and 11696 reactions .",
    "the numerical code for solving rate equations is adapted from nautilus @xcite .",
    "firstly , we modify branching ratios of dissociative recombination reactions .",
    "@xcite suggested that formation of saturated complex molecules by dissociative recombination of their protonated precursors is not efficient .",
    "for example , when protonated methanol ( ch@xmath4oh@xmath35 ) recombines , the branching ratio for ch@xmath4oh + h is only 3% .",
    "recently , @xcite also showed that in dissociative recombination of dimethyl ether cation ( ch@xmath4och@xmath36 ) , the branching ratio for ch@xmath4och@xmath4 + h is only 7% . referring to these experiments , the network of @xcite , which is an extension of @xcite to more complex species , assumed that two - fragment channels ( ex .",
    "x@xmath37 + e@xmath38 @xmath39 y +",
    "z ) represent 5% each , and that the remainder is evenly split between channels with three or more fragments , while in the network of @xcite the branching ratios of dissociative reactions of protonated complex molecules are equally weighted for most species .",
    "we modify the branching ratios in the recombination of protonated precursors of saturated complex molecules following @xcite .",
    "we add some three - body association reactions and collisional dissociation reactions for all neutral species to our network referring to @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "collisional dissociation of h@xmath2 is an exception ; we use the rates in @xcite instead of @xcite .",
    "since collisional dissociation is endothermic , the rate of the collisional dissociation reactions is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the energy barrier , @xmath41 , must be larger than @xmath42 , which is the difference between the formation enthalpy of products and reactants .",
    "in @xcite the value of @xmath41 is set to be lower than @xmath42 for some reactions .",
    "for those reactions , we calculate @xmath42 at 300 k referring to nist - janaf thermochemical tables ( http://kinetics.nist.gov/janaf/ ) and kinetic database for astrochemistry ( kida ; http://kida.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr ; wakelam et al .",
    "2012 ) , and replace @xmath41 with @xmath42 . for the species which are not listed in the network of @xcite the collisional dissociation rates are set to be , @xmath43 if the formation enthalpy of reactants or products are not available in the literature , we assume @xmath42 is @xmath44 k @xmath455 ev ) . we assume that the collisional dissociation reactions preserve functional groups .",
    "otherwise , we assume that one h atom is extracted via the collisional dissociation .",
    "it should be noted that the set of collisional dissociation reactions in our model is likely incomplete because of the lack of experimental data ; for many reactions listed in table a2 , there is no laboratory experiments in which products are confirmed .",
    "if the products are different from those listed in table a2 , the value of @xmath41 should also be different . in section 4.2",
    ", we discuss how the molecular abundances depend on the assumption on the collisional dissociations .      in molecular cloud cores ,",
    "dust grains are negatively charged .",
    "but the population of charged particles changes as the gas density increases @xcite .",
    "grains become the dominant charged particles at high densities ( @xmath46 @xmath7 ) , and eventually grain - surface recombination ( ion - grain collision ) overwhelms gas - phase recombination ( recombination of an free electron with an ion ) .",
    "grain charges should therefore be calculated in the network simultaneously .",
    "we consider neutral and singly charged dust grains .",
    "gaseous species and dust grains interact through electron - grain , ion - grain collisions and adsorption and desorption of neutral species .",
    "table 1 lists the generalized scheme of gas - grain interactions in our model .    a collision between a negatively - charged grain and a positively - charged grain result in two neutral grains .",
    "the collision rate of a grain of radius @xmath47 and charge @xmath48 with another grain of radius @xmath49 and charge @xmath50 is given by @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the reduced mass of the colliding grains @xcite .",
    "we simply assume all grains have the same radius of 10@xmath53 cm and density of 3 g @xmath7 . in the case of electron - grain collisions ,",
    "the rates are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of electron .",
    "an electron sticks to a grain upon collision with a sticking probability of @xmath56 , which strongly depends on the temperature .",
    "we calculate @xmath56 following @xcite , assuming a potential depth of the grain equals to 2 ev .",
    "@xmath57 is a dimensionless reduced rate coefficient including the polarization effect of the grains by the electric field of approaching species .",
    "we applied the approximate formulas given by @xcite , @xmath58 @xmath59 \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{2}{\\tau-2\\nu}\\right)^{1/2}\\right].\\ ] ]    the collision of a cation with a negatively charged grain is theoretically discussed in @xcite , and summarized by @xcite . according to these references , there are two possible processes when a cation approaches a negatively charged grain ; a free electron tunnels to the cation before it hits the grain , or the recombination occurs on the grain surface . for simplicity , we assume the former case , in which the products and branching ratios of the recombination would be the same as the recombination in the gas phase . in the case of the collision of a cation with a neutral grain , recombination probably occurs on grain surfaces , and the products desorb to the gas phase , using the excess energy ( t. umebayashi 2012 , private communication ) .",
    "again , we assume that the products and branching ratios are the same as the corresponding recombination in the gas phase , for simplicity , although they might be different .",
    "for example , if x@xmath37 + e@xmath38 @xmath39 y + z in gas - phase recombination , corresponding grain - surface recombinations are @xmath60 our network includes recombination in the gas phase and on grain surfaces for all cations .",
    "since we assume that each branching ratio for two fragment channels is only 5% ( section 2.2.1 ) , our approach tends to produce smaller molecules via the dissociation of large species .",
    "if we assume that , for example , the branching ratios for all product channels are equal or the collisions lead to simple charge exchange ( ex . x@xmath37 + gr@xmath38 @xmath39 x + gr ) , formation rates of large organic species are enhanced .",
    "in other words , our model gives the lower limit of the abundances of large organic species .",
    "we discuss how much the abundances of large organic molecules are enhanced if we assume the equally weighted branching ratios for grain surface recombination in section 4.2 .",
    "recently , anions have been detected toward both the prestellar core , tmc-1 @xcite , and the protostellar core , l1527 @xcite .",
    "our network includes h@xmath38 , c@xmath38 , o@xmath38 , s@xmath38 , cn@xmath38 , and oh@xmath38 . since interaction between anions and grains are unclear",
    ", we assume simple charge exchange , @xmath61 the rates of grain - ion ( both cation and anion ) collisions are expressed as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the mass and the charge of ions , respectively .",
    "gaseous neutral species collide with dust grains and stick to the grain surface . aw08 and @xcite assumed sticking probabilities of 0.5 and unity , respectively , independent of the temperature .",
    "since the sticking probability should be lower at higher temperatures , we assume that the sticking probability for neutral species is @xmath65^{-1 } , \\label{eqn : s_n}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath66 are the gas and dust temperatures , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath66 are the same .",
    "although equation ( [ eqn : s_n ] ) is originally derived for the sticking probability of a h atom @xcite by fitting the numerical calculations , we use it for all neutral species . for example , the value of @xmath67 is 0.83 at 10 k and 0.54 at 100 k. we might underestimate @xmath67 , because a loss of kinetic energy would be larger for collisions of heavier species with grains .",
    "after species are adsorbed onto grain surfaces , they can desorb to the gas phase again .",
    "we adopt the same desorption energies as @xcite , in which grain - surfaces are assumed to be covered with h@xmath2o ice .",
    "in addition to the thermal desorption , we consider two non - thermal desorption processes .",
    "one is the cosmic - ray induced desorption ; grains are heated up to 70 k by the cosmic - ray bombardment , and it allows temporal evaporations of species with low binding energies @xcite . the other is the chemical desorption ; energy released by the exothermic grain - surface reactions is used to desorb the products .",
    "the efficiency of the desorption is parameterized by @xmath68 , which is the ratio between the surface - molecule bond frequency and the frequency at which the energy is lost to the surface .",
    "we assume @xmath69 0.01 referring to @xcite ; roughly 1% of the products are desorbed into the gas phase .",
    "calculation of grain - surface chemistry is performed in a similar way to @xcite .",
    "the diffusion energy barrier is set to be a half of the desorption energy of each species .",
    "the diffusion rate is exponentially dependent on the diffusion barrier divided by the grain temperature , and surface reaction rates are determined by the sum of the diffusion rates for two reaction partners @xcite .",
    "if surface reactions have activation energy barriers , the barriers are overcome thermally , or via quantum tunneling , whichever is faster .",
    "the modified rate method @xcite is used only for reactions involving atomic hydrogen .",
    "our model also includes photodissociation on grain surfaces by interstellar and cosmic - ray induced uv photons .",
    "our model assumes that molecules are physorbed , which is appropriate as long as grain surfaces are covered with ice . at @xmath70",
    "k , however , ice mantle is sublimated , and chemisorption might become important ( e.g. , section 4.2.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "since grain - surface reactions via chemisorption is out of the scope of this paper , we switch off adsorption of neutral gas - phase species onto grain surfaces , desorption of ice - mantle species to the gas phase , and grain surface reactions , if the temperature becomes greater than 200 k.      table 2 lists the initial abundances in our model .",
    "the elemental abundances adopted here are called `` low metal '' values because of their strong depletions of species heavier than oxygen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "species are initially assumed to be atoms or atomic ions except for hydrogen , which is in molecular form .",
    "we integrate the initial abundances for 10@xmath30 yr with the typical conditions of dense molecular cores , @xmath71 k , @xmath72 @xmath7 and visual extinction of a@xmath73 = 10 mag , which determine the abundances of our initial bonnor - ebert like sphere .",
    "before the collapse begins , we further integrate the updated abundances under the initial hydrostatic conditions during @xmath74 yr ( i.e. , sound crossing time of our core model ) , in order to obtain the starting abundances for the collapse , implicitly assuming that the core keeps its initial hydrostatic structure supported by turbulence . our approach is similar to aw08 and van weeren et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    in the hydrodynamic simulation , we calculate column densities of gas in the @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77directions , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , from the core outer edge to a position of each fluid parcel .",
    "we choose the minimum of @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and convert it to a@xmath73 , via the formula a@xmath81 @xmath82 ) mag @xcite , where @xmath83 is the mean number of hydrogen nuclei per species ( 1.67 ) , @xmath16 is the mean molecular weight ( 2.3 ) and @xmath84 is the mass of a hydrogen atom . for the fluid parcels we follow , the initial values of a@xmath73 are greater than 10 mag , and a@xmath73 increases as the collapse proceeds .",
    "hence the interstellar uv radiation has little effect on chemistry in our model .",
    "cosmic rays are the main source of ionization in molecular clouds .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rate of hydrogen is set to be @xmath85 s@xmath24 .",
    "the attenuation length of cosmic - ray is 96 g @xmath86 @xcite , which is much larger than the column density of typical molecular clouds , but can be smaller than the column density , @xmath87 , calculated above .",
    "the decay of short - lived radio active isotopes , which releases energetic particles , also ionize the ism with rates @xmath88 = ( 7.611 ) @xmath89 10@xmath90 s@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus for direct cosmic - ray ionization and cosmic - ray - induced photo reactions , we assume that the effective cosmic - ray ionization rate is expressed as @xmath91 in our model , the decay of radio active isotopes is the main source of ionization within the first core , while the cosmic - ray dominates at the surface of the first core and infalling envelopes .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the spatial distributions of the gas number density , radial velocity ( @xmath92 ) , and temperature perpendicular to ( a  c ) and along the rotational axis ( d  f ) .",
    "we averaged the distributions perpendicular to the rotational axis in the @xmath93 plane in the azimuth direction .",
    "the solid lines represent the distributions at @xmath29 yr , while the dashed lines represent the distributions at @xmath94 yr .",
    "we define @xmath95 and @xmath96 as @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . although the core has the rotation , the core structures are almost spherical at @xmath99 10 au both in the middle and late stages .",
    "the density has a power law distribution of @xmath100 at @xmath101 au and @xmath102 at 10 au @xmath103 au .",
    "the effect of the rotation becomes apparent in the inner region ( @xmath5 au ) especially in the late stage , in which infalling gases have larger angular momentum .",
    "the accretion onto the first core is supersonic , and the accretion shock occurs at the first core surface .",
    "the first core is quasi - hydrostatic , and in the middle stage its radius is @xmath06 au perpendicular to the rotational axis and @xmath05 au along the rotational axis , respectively , while it is @xmath010 au and @xmath03 au in the late stage .    the temperatures both in the envelope and the first core increase with time as the first core grows , except for the low - temperature region in 5 au @xmath104 10 au around the equatorial plane .",
    "this region experiences strong expansion perpendicular to the rotational axis in a dynamical timescale due to the angular momentum transport .",
    "cooling by the expansion is more efficient than the radiation heating , since the gas is optically thick .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the spatial distributions of fluid parcels in the middle ( left ) and late ( right ) stages .",
    "each parcel is color - coded by its initial distance from the core center ( above the equatorial plane ) or its initial specific angular momentum ( below the equatorial plane ) . in the middle stage , the first core is composed mainly of the fluid parcels which were initially at @xmath105 11501450 au . in the late stage , these parcels have moved to the midplane of inner radii due to contraction , and the outer layers of the first core is composed of parcels falling from the initial radii of @xmath105 17001850 au .",

    "dominant chemical processes vary among the three phases . in the cold phase , adsorption onto and hydrogenation on grain surfaces",

    "in contrast , the grain temperature increases to only @xmath0200 k. the thickness of this layer is @xmath010@xmath33 au , and the cooling time scale of the gas is @xmath01 hour after crossing the shock front ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    ". in our hydrodynamic simulation the shock heating layer is not spatially resolved , and thus our chemical calculations neglect the temperature rise in the shock heating layer . in order to evaluate the effect of shock heating on chemistry , we recalculate the molecular abundances in the parcel discussed in section 3.3 by adding 1 hour integration at the constant temperature when the parcel reaches the first core surface .",
    "since the temperature of the shock heating layer should vary depending on the mass of the first core and the radius where the shock occurs , we calculate two cases : the gas temperature of 1000 k and 2000 k. the density is assumed to be the same as the post - shock gas along the trajectory , @xmath225 @xmath7 .",
    "the grain temperature is assumed to be 200 k , at which temperature ice - mantle species are almost evaporated . in the pre - shock and post - shock regions , on the other hand ,",
    "the species with the high binding energies , such as ch@xmath4oh , is mostly freeze - out on grain surfaces , since the grain temperature is about 80 k. to focus on high temperature chemical processes , we discuss changes of the total ( gas and ice combined ) abundances in this subsection .    in the case of the gas temperature of 1000 k",
    ", the shock heating does not affect the chemistry .",
    "even in the case of the gas temperature of 2000 k , the heating has a limited effect on the chemistry ; among abundant species ( @xmath226 ) , only 23 species increase or decrease by a factor of @xmath32 in the shock heating layer . figure [ fig13 ]",
    "shows the spatial variation of the temperature ( upper panel ) and molecular abundances ( lower panel ) along the trajectory after the parcel experience the shock heating of 2000 k at @xmath227 au and @xmath228 yr ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal axis in figure [ fig13 ] is the position of the parcel in @xmath95 . in the lower panel ,",
    "the solid lines show the molecular abundances with shock heating , while the dashed lines show our original model without the shock heating .",
    "the abundances of hcn and ch@xmath4oh are almost the same between the two models .",
    "h@xmath2co is the most sensitive to the shock heating ; it decreases approximately five orders of magnitude by collisional dissociation to form co and h@xmath2 .",
    "since the abundances of co and h@xmath2 are higher than that of h@xmath2co , the effect of h@xmath2co dissociation to other molecules is insignificant .",
    "the difference between the two models diminishes when the temperature reaches @xmath0500 k , at which collisional dissociation of h@xmath2co becomes efficient in the original model .",
    "carbon species , such as c@xmath2h@xmath2 , are also sensitive to the shock heating ; their abundances are temporally enhanced by approximately four orders of magnitude by the reaction of c@xmath4h@xmath119 and h@xmath2 with the potential barrier of @xmath142 k. the difference in the c@xmath2h@xmath2 abundance diminishes when the temperature reaches @xmath0800 k. therefore our results in section 3 might overestimate the abundance of h@xmath2co , while underestimate the abundance of c@xmath2h@xmath2 in the first core except for the hot central region ( @xmath229 au ) .",
    "while our simple calculation shows that the shock heating affects abundances of some molecules , the effect is limited and the shock heating does not lead to a significant change in our results presented in section 3 .      the first core is a transient object formed prior to the protostar . here",
    ", we briefly discuss what happens after the formation of the protostar and the circumstellar disk in terms of chemistry .",
    "there are several studies which investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disk using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we refer to @xcite , which investigated a longest - term evolution of the circumstellar disk , starting from the gravitational collapse of the molecular cloud core . while the central part ( @xmath230 au ) of the first core collapses to form a protostar , the outer part directly evolves to the cicumstellar disk with a keplerian rotation . in that case",
    ", the chemical composition of the first core corresponds to the initial composition of the circumstellar disk ; the total of gas and ice abundances at @xmath231 au ( @xmath1 k ) in the first core is mostly the same as those in the cold molecular cloud core , while the inner part ( @xmath135 k ) is dominated by the simple molecules , such as co , h@xmath2o and n@xmath2 .",
    "when the protostar is born , the mass of the circumstellar disk ( @xmath00.010.1 @xmath220 ) overwhelms that of the protostar ( @xmath010@xmath33 @xmath220 ) .",
    "it causes the gravitational instability , and angular momentum is efficiently transported via spiral arms .",
    "the mass of the protostar and circumstellar disk increase with time via the accretion from the circumstellar disk and infalling envelope , respectively .",
    "therefore most of the material constituting the first core would accrete to the protostar , and be replaced by the newly accreted envelope material during the disk evolution , although a small fraction of the first core material may have been transported to outer region of the disk carrying angular momentum .",
    "since the envelope material in the protostellar stage is more abundant in large organic molecules than in the first core stage ( section 4.3 ) , the circumstellar disk would be enriched with the large organic molecule .",
    "the large organic molecules also might be formed in the circumstellar disk via gas - phase and/or grain - surface reactions if the fluid parcels stay in the disk long enough ( @xmath232@xmath233 yrs ) ( e.g. , charnley et al .",
    "1992 ; garrod & herbst 2006 ; aikawa et al . in prep ) . on the other hand ,",
    "increasing uv radiation and decreasing attenuation in the envelope cause the photodissociation of molecules , such as h@xmath2o and co , at the surfaces of the disk and the wall of the outflow cavity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have investigated molecular evolution in the first hydrostatic core stage .",
    "we performed the three - dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulation from the molecular cloud core to the first core .",
    "we traced the fluid parcels , which follow the local flow of the gas , and solved molecular evolution along the trajectories , coupling gas - phase and grain - surface chemistry .",
    "we derived the spatial distributions of molecular abundances and column densities in the molecular cloud core harboring the first core .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .",
    "we found that the total molecular abundances of gas and ice of many species in the cold era ( 10 k ) remain unaltered until the temperature reaches @xmath0500 k. the gas abundances in the warm envelope and outer layers of the first core ( @xmath1 k ) are mainly determined via the sublimation of ice - mantle species . above 500 k , the abundant molecules , such as h@xmath2co , start to be destroyed mainly via collisional dissociation or reactions with h atom , and converted to the simple molecules , such as co , h@xmath2o and n@xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "some molecules are effectively formed ; carbon - chains , such as c@xmath2h@xmath2 and cyanopolyynes , are formed at the temperature of @xmath3700 k.    \\2 .",
    "gaseous large organic molecules are associated with the first core ( @xmath234 au ) .",
    "although the abundances of large organic molecules in the first core stage are comparable or smaller than in the protostellar hot corino , their column densities in our model are comparable to the observed values toward the prototypical hot corino , iras 16293 - 2422 . we propose that large organic molecules can be good tracers of the first cores .",
    "the shock wave occurs when the envelope material accretes onto the first core .",
    "we found that the shock heating has little effect on chemistry , if the maximum temperature in the shock heating layer is below 1000 k. even if the gas temperature reaches 2000 k , the heating has a limited effect on chemistry .",
    "while it significantly decreases the h@xmath2co abundance and increases the c@xmath2h@xmath2 abundance in the outer parts of the first core ( @xmath229 au ) , it has little effect on other species .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that outer region of the first core could directly evolve to the circumstellar disk . in that case",
    ", the chemical composition of the first core corresponds to the initial composition of the circumstellar disk ; the total abundances of gas and ice at @xmath231 au ( @xmath1 k ) are mostly determined in the cold molecular cloud cores , while inner parts ( @xmath135 k ) are dominated by simple molecules , such as co , h@xmath2o and n@xmath2 .",
