    "@xcite determined optimal trading strategies for liquidation of a large single - asset portfolio to minimize a combination of volatility risk and market impact costs .",
    "guant et al . (",
    "2012 ) @xcite discussed portfolio liquidation with limit orders from a new perspective .",
    "they linked the optimal trading strategy to the price of the limit orders and provided simple and easy - to - compute expressions for the optimal quotes when a trader in the automated financial market is willing to liquidate a portfolio .",
    "however , most of these literature are based on the assumption that there is only one exchange for traders to submit their limit orders .",
    "it seems that few attempts have been made to study the problem of optimizing the liquidation of a large trade by spreading it across multiple exchanges .",
    "it is generally known that , the trading landscape has seen a large number of evolutions . with the development of electronic exchanges ,",
    "many new trading destinations have appeared to complete the trading capability of the fundamental financial markets such as the nasdaq s inet and nyse in the us , or euronext , the london stock exchange and xetra in europe . as a result",
    ", the same financial instrument can be traded simultaneously in different venues .",
    "these trading venues are generally different from each other in any time because of variation in the fees or rebates they demand to trade and the liquidity they offer .",
    "therefore , to execute a trade , traders may need to split the order across various trading destinations and make decisions on order types , say limit orders or market orders , order sizes and quoting prices .",
    "guilbaud and pham ( 2013,2014 ) @xcite proposed a modelling framework for studying optimal market policies with limit and market orders in a reduced - form model of a single lob .",
    "ganchev et al .",
    "( 2010 ) @xcite discussed the problem of optimizing the allocation of a large trade over multiple competing dark pools .",

    "laruelle et al .",
    "( 2011 ) @xcite proposed a stochastic algorithm approach to the optimization problem .",
    "they devised two stochastic recursive learning procedures which adjusted the proportions of the order to be sent to the different venues , one based on an optimization principle and the other on some reinforcement ideas .",
    "cont and kukanov ( 2012 ) @xcite put forward a quantitative framework and an optimal order routing algorithm , a stochastic algorithm based on order flow sampling , for studying the order allocation problem by formulating it as a convex optimization problem .",
    "this formulation allows readers to study how the optimal order allocation strategy depends on the interplay between the state of order books , the fee structure , order flow properties and the aversion to execution risk .",
    "in contrast with most of the preceding literature , we follow the lines of avellanda and stoikova ( 2008 ) @xcite to discuss the optimal liquidation problem with limit and market orders across multiple trading venues . in order to fully specify the optimal allocation problem , we need a model for the risky asset and the liquidity available for executing market and limit orders .",
    "different from avellanda - stoikov s setting , we employ a two - point jump - diffusion fast mean - reverting stochastic volatility model to describe the dynamics of the mid - market stock price .",
    "specifically , the logarithm of the mid - price of the stock is assumed to follow a brownian motion with fast mean - reverting stochastic volatility plus a compound poisson process with two - point distributed jump sizes , one point describing upward jumps , the other describing downward jumps .",
    "it turns out to exhibit both the `` discontinuous '' and `` asymmetric leptokurtic '' feature , i.e. , jumps , and a higher peak and fatter tail , that the return distribution of assets may have , which has been shown to be more suitable for capturing the asset price dynamics than the normal distribution .",
    "we show that the dynamic properties of the mid - market stock price , such as the intensity of market shocks , the jump sizes of stock prices , the rate of mean - reverting etc .",
    ", are crucial in determining market participants trading behaviour . however , it is not our aim to discuss the effects of these properties on the optimal allocation strategy .",
    "we focus on the discussion of order allocation problem across multiple trading venues using limit and market orders .",
    "different from cont - kukanov s model , order flows in our model , i.e. , the arrival of market orders , are modeled by a poisson process .",
    "the distances from the current market price and the current shapes of the lob determine the priority of execution of limit orders when large market orders get executed . in our framework , the flow of trades is modeled by a poisson process with its intensity depending on the position of limit orders in the lob .",
    "this setting facilitates the derivation of an analytical solution for the optimization problem , which provides a convenient way to discuss how the optimal allocation decisions and the optimal pricing strategies depend on the characteristics of different trading venues .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the second section is devoted to building a model for the dynamics of the mid - market stock price . in the third section",

    "the problem of optimizing the allocation of a large trade over multiple lobs is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the final section summarizes the results .",

    "] : @xmath8 here the volatility process is governed by an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process @xmath9 , the feasibility of which has been discussed in fouque , papanicolaou and sircar ( 2000 ) @xcite , in which the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are positive , @xmath12 @xmath13 is a infinitesimally small perturbed parameter , which is also the reason why we call it a fast mean - reverting model . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two standard one dimensional brownian motions with correlation @xmath16 $ ] . between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is known as the leverage effect , which is documented in the empirical literature . ] the jumps , in the asset s mid - prices , are modelled by a compound poisson process with a constant arriving rate @xmath19 and a two - point distribution measure : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 respectively represent the probabilities of upward and downward jumps .",
    "in other words , at any jump time @xmath7 , @xmath25 in this model , the randomness incurred by the standard brownian motions @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and the randomness incurred by the jumps @xmath26 are supposed to be independent .",
    "these assumptions , however , can be relaxed to develop a more general model . instead of using the double exponential distribution proposed by kou ( 2002 ) @xcite , we adopt here a two - point distribution to describe the jump size in asset price , which allows us to incorporate jumps in asset price , while conserving the analytical tractability .      as pointed out by george box , essentially , all models are wrong , but some are useful .",
    "in fact , all models are rough approximations of reality @xcite",
    ". a good model should be able to capture some of the important empirical features , such as the leverage effect occurred between stock prices and volatilities , the mean - reverting feature of stock price volatility and the discontinuous and leptokurtic feature of the asset return distribution .",
