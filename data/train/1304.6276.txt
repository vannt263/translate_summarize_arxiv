    "a computable function over strings of a finite alphabet is a function that can be computed by a turing machine .",
    "a turing machine takes a string as input , performs a sequence of elementary changes on the string and if it halts , it provides another string as output of the function . in recursion theory",
    "all turing computable function can be obtained via some _ initial functions _ : zero , successor , and projections through applying some _ basic operations _ such as composition , primitive recursion and least search . in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to develop a similar methodology for a class of epistemic functions .",
    "following the same terminology , an epistemic function is a function that takes the epistemic state of a multi - agent system as input and yields a new epistemic state as output .",
    "the notion of epistemic function is the focus of dynamic epistemic logic , baltag et al .",
    "@xcite , and is formalized in action models .",
    "these functions act on kripke models via an update operator and produce an update kripke model . in this paper , we concentrate on those epistemic functions which can be coded as @xmath1 action models .",
    "@xmath1 models are those models which accessibly relations transitive and euclidian .",
    "we claim that there are possible information changes which are not possible to encode them by @xmath2 or @xmath3 action models .",
    "consequently @xmath1 action models are more powerful to describe epistemic functions than @xmath2 and @xmath3 action models .",
    "it is why we consider @xmath1 action models instead of @xmath3 or @xmath2 models .",

    "wrongly_. so the _ basic operators _ should be different kinds of learning .",
    "van ditmarsch et al . introduced a learning constructor in  @xcite .",
    "we define our own learning operator which is different from van ditmarsch s .    as our _ initial functions _ , we take the _ test _ of any facts @xmath4 , that is @xmath5 .",
    "for the _ basic operations _ , we take the following different kinds of learning : 1- _ alternative learning _ , 2- _ concurrent learning _ , 3- _ wrong learning _ , and finally , 4- _ recursive learning_. following the footsteps of recursion theory , we prove that all epistemic functions can be obtained through the test of facts by applying the above four _ basic operations_.    epistemic logic , started with hintikka s groundwork  @xcite , models and reasons about the knowledge of agents in a group  @xcite . in epistemic logic ,",
    "the notions of knowledge and belief are modeled in terms of the possible worlds ( states ) .",
    "an agent knows or believes a fact if it is true in all the worlds that the agent considers possible as alternatives for the actual world .",
    "as information is transmitted , knowledge and belief of agents in a multi - agent system may change .",
    "the simplest cause for an information change is to announce some truth in public .",
    "plaza in 1989  @xcite , introduced a logic to formalize these changes and called it the public announcement logic . in public announcement logic , a fact is publicly announced in a multi - agent system and all agents together update their knowledge and belief .",
    "however , more complex actions than such as private or dishonest announcements may occur , this is whereby different agents may have different views on some action  @xcite , or the announcement may not be truthful .",
    "our work may be considered as a bridge between two paradigms in dynamic epistemic logic , namely baltag et al . style action model and van ditmarsch et al .",
    "epistemic actions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ bak ] , we recall the definition of action models from  @xcite , and we explain what it means that a group of agents learns an action model .",
    "we discuss @xmath1 kripke models which only have transitive and euclidian properties .",
    "we also introduce a new notion called the",
    "_ applicable formulas _ , and restrict the definition of satisfaction relation only to applicable formulas .    in section  [ sdel ]",
    ", we introduce the initial functions and basic operations as the building blocks of the finite epistemic functions .    in section  [ lbr ] , we add the new operator of recursion in constructing the finite epistemic functions .",
    "finally , in section  [ crfw ] , we compare our work with other related works , and further works may be done .",
    "in this section , we introduce two significant notion : 1- learning an action model , 2- @xmath1 kripke models and applicable formulas .      we start by recalling the definition of an action model from baltag  @xcite .",
    "a pointed action model @xmath6 is a tuple @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a set of events , @xmath9 is a set of agents , @xmath10 is an accessibility relation for agent @xmath11 on events in @xmath8 , and @xmath12 is a function that assigns to each event , a formula of an appropriate epistemic language , as a precondition for that event .",

    "for example , @xmath473 is an action model which says :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath4 is announced and agent @xmath26 is suspicious whether he learns @xmath4 or learns @xmath19 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    one may compare the above learning program with the action @xmath474 in dynamic epistemic logic , and observe that for all @xmath3 epistemic state @xmath66 , we have that @xmath475 is bisimilar to @xmath476 $ ] .",

    "another way to represent information change is via the notion of epistemic program introduced in  @xcite .",
