    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , unlike in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , the conservation of lepton number ( @xmath0 ) and of baryon number ( @xmath1 ) is not automatic @xcite . in particular , the superpotential can contain renormalizable and gauge invariant @xmath2 and @xmath3violating terms .",
    "the general forms of these are @xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 are family indices , and summations over @xmath7 are implied . in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) @xmath8 are the s@xmath9-doublet lepton and quark superfields , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the @xmath13-singlet charged lepton , and up- and down - type quark superfields ; @xmath14 is the higgs superfield which generates the masses of the up - type quarks .",
    "the constants @xmath15 are antisymmetric under the interchange @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is antisymmetric under @xmath18 .",
    "the couplings in @xmath19 and @xmath20 violate invariance under @xmath21-parity ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spin of the particle ; thus @xmath24 for the particles of the sm , and @xmath25 for their superpartners ) @xcite .",
    "if both the @xmath26-term and the @xmath27-term is present , some of the products would have to be extremely small ( for example , @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) to prevent too rapid proton decay @xcite .",
    "one way to deal with this problem is to postulate @xmath21-parity invariance .",
    "this would eliminate both @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath1 is conserved , but the @xmath0-violating terms are present .",
    "this scenario is obtained by demanding invariance under `` baryon parity '' ( under baryon parity @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath35 remain unchanged ) @xcite .",
    "the model we shall consider in the following is the @xmath21-parity violating mssm ( r / mssm ) , defined as the mssm with @xmath19 included in the superpotential @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath21-parity violating couplings has rich phenomenological implications .",
    "if @xmath21-parity is violated , the production of single supersymmetric particles becomes possible , and the lightest supersymmetric particle is no longer stable . the main source of constraints on the @xmath21-parity violating coupling constants is experimental data on processes with the sm particles , to which the @xmath21-parity violating couplings can contribute through the exchange of single squarks or sleptons .",
    "the present status of these bounds is given in the reviews in ref .",
    "most of the upper limits on the individual coupling constants are of the order of @xmath36 for squark and slepton masses of @xmath37 gev .",
    "there are also more stringent bounds , including some on products of two coupling constants , coming mainly from processes forbidden in the sm .",
    "the @xmath21-parity violating coupling constants can be complex , and thus represent new sources of cp - violation .",
    "stringent constraints come from the experimental values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the effects of cp - violating @xmath21-parity violating interactions have also been considered in semileptonic k - decays @xcite , b - decays @xcite , semi - inclusive decays of heavy quarks @xcite , leptonic collider processes @xcite , and in lepton - pair production in @xmath40 reactions @xcite .    in this paper we show that the present experimental limits on @xmath41 , @xmath42-violating e - n interactions ( electron - nucleon interactions that violate both parity and time reversal invariance ) set stringent bounds on the imaginary parts of some of the products @xmath43 . in the next section",

    "they can be as strong as allowed by the present experimental limits . in the @xmath21-parity conserving mssm the constants @xmath48 ( which are the dominant ones @xcite ) are smaller by several orders of magnitude than the present limit on @xmath48 [ eq . ( 4 ) ] .",
    "this is implied by the limit on the pertinent cp - violating phase , obtained from the limit on the @xmath41 , @xmath42-violating nucleon - nucleon interactions set by the experimental limit on @xmath63 @xcite .",

    "it is easy to see that in the former case the electron - quark interaction has no p , t - violating component .",
    "the reason is that the only terms in ( 9 ) involving the electron field are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and therefore their contribution to the electron - quark interactions must be proportional to @xmath74 , which is insensitive to cp - violating phases .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42-violating contributions do arise however from combinations of a @xmath15 and a @xmath68 term .",
