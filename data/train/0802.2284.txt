    "in recent years strong observational evidencies appeared supporting the claim that the universe is accelerating its expansion .",
    "the observations are based on supernovae of type ia ( snia ) used as standard candles in order to calculate the distance to them @xcite . since in standard friedmann - robertson - lemaitre - walker ( frlw )",
    "cosmological models , with nonrelativistic matter and radiation , acceleration is not possible , some people argue that the universe must be dominated by cosmological constant or by some other smooth exotic component influencing negative pressure .",
    "there are many different physical scenarios trying to explain existence of such exotic form of matter @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose different approach , in which exotic matter is not necessary to drive accelerated expansion .",
    "instead we relax the assumption of homogeneity of space leaving the isotropy with respect to one point .",
    "in other words we replace the usual cosmological principle by copernican cosmological principle @xcite or some generalized version of the copernican principle stating that our galaxy is at the centre of the universe . from philosophical point of view",
    "this assumption seems to be very artificial but our intention is to show that even such an exotic model does not contradict observations @xcite .",
    "we shall deal with spherically symmetric stephani models @xcite with the metric given by @xmath13 ^ 2d\\tau^2- { r^2(\\tau)\\over v^2(r,\\tau ) } ( dr^2+r^2d\\omega^2),\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are defined @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not all independent but are related with each other with the help of expressions @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following from the einstein equations .",
    "@xmath20 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "note that in the considered spherically symmetric stephani models and in the given coordinate system , the energy density @xmath22 is uniform , while the pressure @xmath23 is not and depends on the distance from the symmetry center placed at @xmath24 .",
    "this is the reason why in such models barotropic equation of state ( i.e. of the form @xmath25 does not exist . if we , however , assume some relation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , this could allow us to eliminate one of the unknown functions , e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "hence we are left with two unknown functions @xmath27 and @xmath18 .",
    "the first one @xmath27 plays a role of spatial curvature index , while the second one @xmath18 is stephani version of frlw scale factor .",
    "as far as in frlw models the curvature index is constant @xmath28 and does not change in the process of evolution of the universe , in stephani models this is not the case . due to matter transfer , caused by the gradient of pressure , the curvature index may change with time @xcite . similarly as in frlw cosmology , where the value of @xmath29 must be determined from observations , in stephani models the choice concerns the whole function @xmath27 . as regards the scale factor @xmath18 , some arbitrariness is connected with the choice of time parameter @xmath21 .",
    "we remove this arbitrariness by assuming that the time parameter is a proper time of an observer placed at the symmetry center of the model @xmath30 .    in the next section",
    "we determine spherically symmetric stephani cosmological model by assuming barotropic equation of state in the neighbourhood of the symmetry center and by assuming a relation between the scale factor @xmath18 and arbitrary function @xmath27 .    in section 3",
    "we perform classification of possible cosmological models depending on two parameters : @xmath4-parameter appearing in the equation of state , therefore determining kind of matter filling up the universe , and @xmath5-parameter responsible for the global geometry of the model .    in section 4",
    "we focus our attention on one model corresponding to vanishing @xmath4-parameter ( dust - like matter ) and to negative @xmath5-parameter ( hyperbolic geometry ) .",
    "the model exhibits accelerated expansion at later stages of evolution .",
    "section 5 is devoted to definition of hubble and deceleration parameters in spherically symmetric stephani models .",
    "we show that in the considered model , in spite of the fact that local observations of galaxies give positive deceleration parameter , in the case of more distant ones , negative deceleration parameter can be observed .    in section 6",
    "we discuss the redshift - magnitude relation in the model and fit our theoretical curves to the supernovae ia observational data .",
    "in section 7 we compare age of the universe in the considered stephani model to the age in flrw model determined by the same @xmath31 and @xmath4 parameters .    in section 8",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "now we consider an observer placed at the symmetry center of the spherically symmetric stephani universe @xmath30 .",
    "all our physical assumptions will concern his neighbourhood .",
    "first of all we assume that locally , matter filling up the universe fulfills a barotropic equation of state of the standard form @xmath32 where @xmath4 is some constant @xmath33 .",
    "for example @xmath34 corresponds to dust and @xmath35 to relativistic matter . for negative @xmath4 pressure becomes negative and we regard an appropriate matter to be in exotic form .",
    "an extreme value of @xmath4 @xmath36 corresponds to cosmological constant .    substituting ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 6 ) we find an explicit form of the function @xmath26 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is some constant .",
    "choosing a curvature function @xmath27 in a form @xmath39 determines uniquely the function @xmath15 , which now reads @xmath40 @xmath5 is a constant , which can be either negative , zero or positive .    the condition ( 8) is of course not the most general one .",
    "the simplicity was the only criterion for choosing it .",
    "however , one can easily show that any condition of the form @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) gives similar results to that ones obtained in the present paper .",
    "now we are left with the time parameter @xmath21 which is not uniquely determined so far . in frlw models",
    "the time parameter is usually chosen globally to be a proper time of any comoving observer . in",
    "spherically symmetric stephani models usually different choice is realized . since there exists only one symmetry center in the models it seems natural to distinguish just this point .",
    "hence the time parameter is chosen in a special way to be a proper time of an observer placed at the symmetry center .",
    "it is not a proper time of any other observer .",
    "to do that we put @xcite @xmath43=1,\\ ] ] what together with ( 8) and ( 9 ) gives a dynamical equation for the stephani version of the scale factor @xmath2 @xmath44 or more familiar form resembling a friedmann equation @xmath45 where the energy density @xmath46 is calculated from ( 4 ) @xmath47 and @xmath48 is some constant .",
    "new time parameter is now denoted by @xmath49 and will be regarded as a cosmic time .",
    "solution of the equation ( 11 ) could give us a full information about evolution of the model .",
    "what we are interested in is how the type of evolution is influenced by the numerical values of parameters of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that barrett and clarkson @xcite also discussed two parameter class of spherically symmetric stephani models but of different type .",
    "their models do not admit dust - like @xmath7 equation of state at the symmetry center .",
    "qualitative classification of spherically symmetric cosmological models depending on different values of parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be performed without solving the equation ( 11 ) . for this purpose",
    "we use a standard method @xcite consisting in treating the evolution equation ( 11 ) as the energy conservation principle for some dynamical system with kinetic energy @xmath50 and potential energy @xmath51 then the energy conservation principle reads @xmath52 now , illustrating the potential energy @xmath53 on a diagram and keeping in mind that @xmath50 must be positive we deduce qualitative behaviour of the scale factor @xmath2 for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we do not consider the case @xmath54 since it corresponds to frlw einstein - de sitter model .",
    "all other models split naturally into two cases depending on the sign of the @xmath5-parameter .",
    "moreover in the frame of each case five subcases can be pointed out , corresponding to the following ranges of the @xmath4-parameter :    \\a ) @xmath55 ,    \\b ) @xmath56 ,    \\c ) @xmath57 ,    \\d ) @xmath58 ,    \\e ) @xmath59 .     of associated dynamical system ( left diagrams ) and corresponding evolution of the scale factor @xmath2 ( right diagrams ) for positive @xmath5-parameter ( closed geometry ) and different values of @xmath4-parameter.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]     of associated dynamical system ( left diagrams ) and corresponding evolution of the scale factor @xmath2 ( right diagrams ) for negative @xmath5-parameter ( open geometry ) and different values of @xmath4-parameter.,scaledwidth=62.0% ]    appropriate behaviours of the potential energy @xmath53 and corresponding evolution of the scale factor @xmath2 are illustrated in figs 1 and 2 .",
    "some of the above presented cosmological models were already discussed in detail in literature .",
    "especially much attention was paid to the model corresponding to @xmath60 ( figs 1b , 2b ) due to its particular simplicity ( scale factor can be calculated explicitly ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , some other models can also be expressed in an analytic way . in the present paper , however , we shall concentrate on the case , which mathematically is not so simple , but from physical point of view is very interesting because it relates to the snia observations suggesting accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch @xcite . the model",
    "we want to discuss is presented in fig .",
    "it is well known that in frlw cosmology accelerated expansion of the universe may be only obtained in the case when the universe is filled with some exotic form of matter influencing negative pressure , e.g. cosmological constant . however , if we look at fig .",
    "2a we notice that in the spherically symmetric stephani model the universe can exhibit accelerated expansion also in the case of vanishing or positive pressure at least at the symmetry center . strictly speaking accelerated expansion takes place for every value of @xmath4 at least at later stages of evolution , provided that @xmath61 ( hyperbolic geometry ) .",
    "but it seems to us that the model corresponding to vanishing @xmath4 is the simplest one , moreover it describes locally ( in the neighbourhood of the observer located at the symmetry center ) pressureless matter - dominated universe which is in agreement with local observations .",
    "so putting @xmath34 we find the energy density @xmath46 and the pressure @xmath62 to be equal to @xmath63 and @xmath64 note that indeed at the symmetry center @xmath30 pressure vanishes , however , due to hyperbolic geometry",
    "@xmath61 it effectively becomes negative at larger distances from the symmetry center .",
    "so in spite of the fact that the energy density scales with the expansion as ordinary nonrelativistic matter @xmath65 , due to negativeness of pressure , for @xmath66 , it is exotic .",
    "stephani version of the friedmann equation now reads @xmath67 and unfortunately can not be solved in an elementary way .",
    "however in two extreme cases corresponding to small and large @xmath68 exact solutions can be easily found .",
    "they are @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the first case the solution is of einstein - de sitter type , while in the second case the evolution is evidently inflationary of power law type .",
    "it means that in our model the universe starts as decelerating and finally ends up as accelerating one . in the simplest frlw",
    "cosmological models with one component fluid filling up the universe such behaviour is not possible . in the present model , inspite of the fact that formally it is of one component type ( dust - like matter ) the curvature term is non - trivial ( see the condition ( 8) ) and simulates the existence of some exotic fluid driving the power - law inflation at later epoch .    in the next section",
    "we discuss some observational parameters in the model .",
    "observational parameters which describe kinematics of the evolution of the universe are hubble parameter @xmath71 and deceleration parameter @xmath72 . in flrw models they are constant on time slices due to homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "it does not to be the case in spherically symmetric stephani models , in which homogeneity does not take place .",
    "following ellis @xcite we define @xmath71 and @xmath72 in a general case by @xmath73 where @xmath21 is here proper time measured along the particle world line , and @xmath74 is some representative length along the particle world - lines .    in flrw cosmological models",
    "the above expressions go over into the standard ones @xmath75 where @xmath68 is a scale factor entering the space part of the line - element @xmath76 in our spherically symmetric stephani models the line element is given by @xmath77 hence neither @xmath49 is proper time of any comoving observer , nor @xmath2 is a true scale factor ( uniquely determining the length @xmath74 ) . in order to calculate @xmath71 and @xmath72 we have to rewrite the line element using global time parametrization @xmath78 where we defined @xmath79 now the definitions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 read @xmath80 note that generally @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not spatially constant anymore , what should not be surprising in non - homogeneous universe .",
    "it can be shown , however , that it is possible to choose time parameter with the aid of which defined hubble parameter does not depend on @xmath81 .",
    "it turns out that the time parameter @xmath49 in the line element ( 24 ) is just such a parameter , i.e. @xmath82 in other words with this time parameter the expansion is the same at every point of time slice of the model .",
    "unfortunately it does not happen in the case of @xmath72 parameter which is evidently coordinate dependent @xcite .",
    "explicit calculation gives @xmath83 or @xmath84 where we defined @xmath85 for deceleration parameter in neighbourhood of the symmetry center .",
    "since @xmath61 in our model , the deceleration parameter @xmath86 decreases with increasing distance to the observed galaxy .",
    "physically it means that in our non - homogeneous universe acceleration of the expansion increases with distance .    in order to see how the deceleration parameter @xmath86 depends on the redshift we express @xmath87 and @xmath2 in terms of observational parameters @xmath31 and @xmath88 , where @xmath12 is energy density parameter at present epoch and @xmath88 is a redshift of a galaxy placed at some point determined by comoving",
    "coordinate @xmath81 . since in the considered stephani models energy density",
    "@xmath46 is constant in space , energy density parameter @xmath89 can be defined similarly as in flrw models , i.e. @xmath90 where @xmath91 is critical energy density defined as actual energy density in the model with flat geometry @xmath92    expressing the comoving coordinate @xmath81 in terms of observational parameters is essential for our purposes and can be performed in a standard way by putting the infinitesimal space - time interval @xmath93 connecting two light events equal to zero ( we choose coordinate system in such a way that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are constant along light ray path from galaxy to observer ) . hence we get @xmath96 or equivalently @xmath97 after getting rid of @xmath49 variable using ( 11 ) .",
    "constants @xmath5 and @xmath98 can be found by writing down friedmann equation ( 11 ) or ( 12 ) for the present epoch @xmath99 and by making use of the definition of @xmath12 parameter : @xmath100 substituting these expressions into ( 35 ) , next integrating both sides and changing integration variable we get integral formula for @xmath81 @xmath101 @xmath68 is a scale factor at the epoch when the light ray was emitted by the observed galaxy .",
    "unfortunately integration can not be performed explicitly either in general case or even in the special case corresponding to @xmath102 we compute it approximately assuming that @xmath12 is small with respect to the ratio @xmath103 physically it means that in order to keep the approximation valid , the larger distances @xmath81 are calculated , the smaller energy density parameter @xmath12 has to be taken into account . then we skip the first term under the square root in ( 38 ) and the integration can be carried out explicitly giving @xmath104 together with the relation @xcite @xmath105 we obtain system of algebraic equations which can be solved with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath81 @xmath106 substituting ( 28a ) and ( 33 ) into ( 24b ) we find present value @xmath99 of the deceleration parameter of the region of the universe where a galaxy with the observed redshift @xmath88 is placed @xmath107 @xmath108 is a local value of the deceleration parameter .    in this model , in spite of the fact that local observations of galaxies give positive value of @xmath108 , in the case of more distant ones @xmath109 negative deceleration parameter is measured .",
    "more detailed description of the model from the point of view of observations requires derivation of coordinate independent relation between observational parameters .",
    "redshift - magnitude relation is just such a relation and finding it will be our next task .",
    "in cosmological models which are not homogeneous and isotropic one of the methods allowing for finding redshift - magnitude relation is based on formalism proposed by kristian and sachs @xcite and ellis and maccallum @xcite leading to relation in form of power series around the observer s position . but this method is not very effective if large redshifts are taken into account .    due to",
    "spherical symmetry of the model it is possible , however , to find closed formula for apparent bolometric magnitude @xmath110 of galaxy , as a function of redshift @xmath88 in the case of small @xmath12-parameter .",
    "the problem consists then in explicit calculation of the luminosity distance @xmath111 .",
    "the formula for the luminosity distance in our spherically symmetric model is the same as in flrw models and reads @xcite @xmath112 making use of earlier derived expressions for @xmath87 and @xmath68 we find @xmath113 for small redshifts @xmath114 the expression goes over into usual distance - redshift relation known from friedmann cosmology ( we remind that the above formula is valid only for small values of @xmath12 ) @xmath115 however , for larger redshifts it grows faster than in flrw models , where @xmath116,\\ ] ] and is in favor of snia observations .",
    "finding general formula for @xmath111 requires numerical integration of ( 38 ) . before doing that we expand @xmath117 in our model into taylor series with respect to the @xmath88-variable . up to the second order",
    "we get ( for arbitrary @xmath12 and @xmath4 ) @xmath118\\right\\}.\\ ] ] comparing with the analogous expansion of the mattig formula @xcite , which up to the same order in the dust filled universe ( @xmath34 ) reads @xmath119 $ ] , we notice that for arbitrary @xmath12 redshift - magnitude formula in the stephani model indeed grows faster than in the friedmann model at least for relatively small values of @xmath88 , for which the taylor expansion is valid .",
    "since supernovae of type ia favoring accelerated evolution of the universe were discovered at relatively large redshifts @xmath120 full formula for the luminosity distance is required valid not only for small @xmath88 .",
    "hence taylor expansion calculated up to low order is not satisfactory and we must calculate @xmath117 numerically .",
    "the results of this numerical calculation are presented in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "first ( figure 3 ) , we compare the redshift magnitude relation obtained in both friedmann and stephani spherically symmetric models determined by the same cosmological parameters @xmath121 and the @xmath4-parameter responsible for the form of matter filling locally the universe .",
    "we realize that for relatively large redshifts the curves @xmath8 in both models diverge and the relation @xmath8 in the stephani model looks like the appropriate relation in the friedmann model but with the cosmological constant .",
    "in other words nonhomogeneity in the spherical symmetric stephani model in some sense simulates existence of the @xmath122-term .     in friedmann cosmological model ( lower line ) and in the spherically - symmetric stephani model ( upper line ) .",
    "in both models the same cosmological parameters are chosen : @xmath9 km / smpc , @xmath123.,scaledwidth=69.0% ]    in fig .",
    "4 the redshift - magnitude relation in the stephani model is compared with some observational data from the supernova cosmology project @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we notice that the most distant supernovae of type ia fit quite well to the dust - like ( @xmath34 ) stephani cosmological model with the energy density parameter @xmath10 .",

    "we find the age of the universe in the considered models by direct integration of stephani version of the friedmann equation ( 11 ) @xmath125 analogously calculated age of the universe in flrw models reads @xmath126 we easily realize that the age in stephani models is longer than in flrw ones corresponding to the same values of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath4 . for @xmath34 and @xmath127 km / smpc ( @xmath128 ) and on the same diagram ( fig .",

    "in the paper we considered a class of spherically symmetric stephani cosmological models parametrized by two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the @xmath4-parameter determines the form of barotropic equation of state in the neighbourhood of the symmetry center of the models and @xmath5-parameter is related to the curvature index .",
    "we performed qualitative classification of evolution types of models depending on different values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we showed that for negative @xmath5 the universe exhibits accelerated expansion independently of @xmath4 , what does not take place in flrw models .",
    "we focused our attention on the model corresponding to @xmath34 . in this model pressure",
    "is negligible in the neighbourhood of the symmetry center ( the so - called dust - like model ) and the model looks like of einstein - de sitter type at the early stage of evolution . at later epoch",
    "the evolution is inflationary of power law form .",
    "this result seems to be interesting because we showed that existence of `` exotic '' matter ( influencing negative pressure ) is not necessary ( at least locally ) to drive accelerated expansion of more distant regions .",
    "we also showed that acceleration becomes larger while increasing the distance to the galaxy .",
    "we derived redshift - magnitude formula in the model and showed that for large relatively large redshifts ( @xmath134 ) apparent bolometric magnitude @xmath8 grows faster than in corresponding flrw model what is in favor of snia observational data .",

    "it should be noted that the good fit of @xmath8 to the snia observational data in spherically - symmetric stephani cosmological model has been already obtained by dabrowski and hendry @xcite .",
    "however in their model they assumed a string - like ( @xmath60 ) equation of state at the center of symmetry .",
    "concluding we would like to stress that we do not claim that our surrounding universe is of stephani type .",
    "we wanted to show that there exist different from isotropic and homogeneous cosmological models which give the same observational evidencies as frwl models with the cosmological constant . in these models the deviation from homogeneity could be so small that locally ( up to several hundreds of megaparsecs)it would be undetectable .",
    "however its existence could show up at larger distances .    in the paper we considered only one fluid component filling up the universe .",
    "it is of course oversimplification and is hardly acceptable especially in the context of negativness of pressure at larger distances .",
    "it can be shown , however , that adding usual dust component into the model do not change relations ( 16 , 17 ) significantly ( only a constant in ( 16 ) will be different ) and the qualitative result will be the same .",
    "it seems that these two different fluid components should effect in the form of the power spectrum of the cmb anisotropies .",
