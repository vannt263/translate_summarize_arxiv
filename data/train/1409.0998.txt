    "the complexity of automotive control networks has been rapidly growing . to satisfy the increasing network bandwidth required in next - generation automotive networks , new network protocols such as flexray , controller area network with flexible data - rate ( can fd ) , and ethernet have been developed . in ethernet networks ,",
    "worst - case latency and real - time property of ethernet frames are not guaranteed .",
    "consequently , several improved ethernet protocols such as ethernet audio video bridging ( avb ) and ttethernet have been proposed .",
    "simulation - based evaluations of such protocols are presented in @xcite . when ethernet is used as a backbone network for automotive control networks ,",
    "existing can sub - networks are connected to the ethernet bus via a can  ethernet gw .",
    "this gw converts can messages to ethernet frames and vice versa . in @xcite",
    ", we developed a can  ethernet gw model for omnet++ @xcite and evaluated several can  ethernet conversion algorithms proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a can  ethernet avb simulation environment has never been proposed before .",
    "this paper presents a simulation environment for can  ethernet avb networks based on omnet++ and the inet framework @xcite . using ethernet avb as a backbone bus protocol",
    ", we develop a can  ethernet avb gw model . to improve the real - time property of can messages , we propose a simple scheduling algorithm . in the algorithm , only ethernet avb frames that consist of can messages are transferred with guaranteed network bandwidth ; ethernet frames are transferred with best - effort , where network bandwidth is not guaranteed .",
    "the results of measurement for the latency of can messages sent from a can bus to an ethernet avb node via the ethernet avb bus in a prototype network confirm that our proposed algorithm minimizes and limits latency of the ethernet avb frames containing can messages .",
    "a prototype can  ethernet avb mixed network is presented in figure [ network ] . in the network , the 100-mbps ethernet avb bus is used as a backbone bus between a 1-mbps can bus and a 100-mbps ethernet avb bus .",
    "we assume that ethernet avb frames and ethernet frames pass through the backbone avb bus : ethernet avb frames comprising can messages with real - time constraints , and ethernet frames , which are not sent from a can bus , without real - time constraints .",
    "our simulation environment is based on omnet++ , and the inet framework .",
    "we used simulation models of ethernet avb switches and ethernet avb nodes distributed as open - source software in core4inet @xcite .",
    "we also utilized can node , can bus , and can  ethernet gw simulation models , developed as described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ gw - model ] depicts our prototype can  ethernet avb gw model . in the can  ethernet avb gw ,",
    "can messages are queued in fifo order and packed into an ethernet frame periodically in the can  ethernet protocol converter , called @xmath0 .",
    "then the ethernet frame is converted to the ethernet avb frame by a conversion mechanism between ethernet frames and ethernet avb frames . in the ethernet avb model used in the ethernet avb node and ethernet avb switches ,",
    "there are two types of queues , an avb queue and a best - effort queue .",
    "as stated above , in our scheduling algorithm , only ethernet avb frames comprising can messages are queued in the avb queue to guarantee their real - time constraints .",
    "the ethernet frames are stored in the best - effort queue , where network bandwidth is not guaranteed .",
    "further , we implemented the scheduling algorithm in our can  ethernet avb gw model .",
    "in our preliminary evaluation of the simulation environment developed and the proposed scheduling algorithm , we measured the latency of the can messages sent from the can node @xmath1 to the ethernet avb node @xmath2 in figure [ network ] .",
    "the communications from the ethernet avb bus to the can bus are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the results of our evaluation are graphically illustrated in figure [ results ] .",
    "the x - axis shows the transmission time of the can messages from sender , which transmits the can messages with the same i d in every 3 ms . the y - axis shows the latency of the can messages . @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 represent the latency of the can messages queued in the best - effort queue in each of the ethernet avb switches and nodes .",
    "@xmath3 represents the latency when only can messages are transmitted .",
    "the latency of @xmath4 is achieved in the network via 1.47 kb of jamming ethernet frames transmitted repeatedly in [ 1,25 ] @xmath5s periods by @xmath6 . in this case ,",
    "ethernet frames that include can messages are disrupted by the jamming frames in the best - effort queues .",
    "latency @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the latency of the can messages that are queued in the avb queue of the can  ethernet avb gw and avb switches by the proposed scheduling algorithm . because these ethernet avb frames are transferred with higher priority than the ethernet frames queued in the best - effort queues , the latency of the can messages is minimized and limited , as can be seen in figure [ results ] .",
    "this paper presented a simulation environment for can  ethernet avb mixed networks based on omnet++ .",
    "the results of a preliminary evaluation , in which we measured the latency of can messages sent from a can node to an ethernet avb node via a backbone ethernet avb bus , show that minimization and limitation of latency can be achieved by our proposed scheduling algorithm in can  ethernet avb gw . we plan to improve the can  ethernet gw model and the scheduling algorithm , and evaluate them in real use cases in future work .",
    "we also plan to distribute the source code of the simulation models on our website .",
