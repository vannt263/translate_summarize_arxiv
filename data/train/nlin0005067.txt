    "recently , much effort has been invested to understand inertial - range anomalous scaling of a passive scalar .",
    "both the natural and numerical experiments suggest that the violation of the classical kolmogorov  obukhov theory @xcite is even more strongly pronounced for a passively advected scalar field than for the velocity field itself ; see , e.g. , @xcite and literature cited therein . at the same time",
    ", the problem of passive advection appears to be easier tractable theoretically .",
    "the most remarkable progress has been achieved for the so - called kraichnan s rapid - change model @xcite : for the first time , the anomalous exponents have been calculated on the basis of a microscopic model and within regular expansions in formal small parameters ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    within the `` zero - mode approach , '' developed in @xcite ,",
    "nontrivial anomalous exponents are related to the zero modes ( unforced solutions ) of the closed exact equations satisfied by the equal - time correlations . within the approach based on the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and operator product expansion ( ope ) ,",
    "the anomalous scaling emerges as a consequence of the existence in the model of composite operators with _ negative _ critical dimensions , which determine the anomalous exponents @xcite .",
    "another important question recently addressed is the effects of large - scale anisotropy on inertial - range statistics of passively advected fields @xcite and the velocity field itself @xcite . according to the classical kolmogorov ",
    "obukhov theory , the anisotropy introduced at large scales by the forcing ( boundary conditions , geometry of an obstacle etc .",
    ") dies out when the energy is transferred down to the smaller scales owing to the cascade mechanism @xcite .",
    "a number of recent works confirms this picture for the _ even _ correlation functions , thus giving some quantitative support to the aforementioned hypothesis on the restored local isotropy of the inertial - range turbulence for the velocity and passive fields @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the exponents describing the inertial - range scaling exhibit universality and hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy , and the leading contribution to an even function is given by the exponent from the isotropic shell @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the anisotropy survives in the inertial range and reveals itself in _ odd _ correlation functions , in disagreement with what was expected on the basis of the cascade ideas .",
    "the so - called skewness factor decreases down the scales much slower than expected @xcite , while the higher - order odd dimensionless ratios ( hyperskewness ets ) increase , thus signalling of persistent small - scale anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the effect seems rather universal , being observed for the scalar @xcite and vector @xcite fields , advected by the gaussian rapid - change velocity , and for the scalar advected by the two - dimensional navier - stokes velocity field @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the anomalous scaling behavior of a passive scalar advected by the time - decorrelated strongly anisotropic gaussian velocity field . in contradistinction with the studies of @xcite , where the velocity was isotropic and",
    "the large - scale anisotropy was introduced by the imposed linear mean gradient , the uniaxial anisotropy in our model persists for all scales , leading to nonuniversality of the anomalous exponents through their dependence on the anisotropy parameters .",
    "the aim of our paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , we obtain explicit inertial - range expressions for the structure functions and correlation functions of the scalar gradients and calculate the corresponding anomalous exponents to the first order of the @xmath3 expansion .",
    "we show that the exponents in our model become nonuniversal through the dependence on the parameters describing the anisotropy of the velocity field .",
    "owing to the anisotropy of the velocity statistics , the composite operators of different ranks mix strongly in renormalization , and the corresponding anomalous exponents are given by the eigenvalues of the matrices which are neither diagonal nor triangular ( in contrast with the case of large - scale anisotropy ) .",
    "in the language of the zero - mode technique this means that the @xmath8 decompositions of the correlation functions ( employed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) do not lead to the diagonalization of the differential operators in the corresponding exact equations .",
    "nevertheless , the hierarchy obeyed by the exponents for the vanishing anisotropy survives when the anisotropy becomes strong .",
    "this fact ( along with the nonuniversality ) is the main qualitative result of the paper .",
    "another scope of the paper is to give the detailed account of the rg approach and to compare the results obtained within both the rg and zero - mode techniques on the example of the second - order structure function .",
