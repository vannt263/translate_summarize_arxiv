    "an unusual type of two - dimensional conductor , the chiral metal , may be formed at the surface of a layered , three - dimensional system in the presence of a magnetic field which has a component perpendicular to the layers @xcite .",
    "it occurs in a system of weakly - coupled layers at magnetic field - strengths for which an isolated layer would have an integer quantised hall conductance . under these circumstances ,",
    "bulk states are localised and the extended , chiral edge states associated with each layer hybridise to form a two - dimensional conductor at the surface of the sample .",
    "properties of this chiral metal may be probed by conductance measurements with current flow normal to the layers",
    ".    early experimental work on semiconductor multilayer samples @xcite established that the integer quantum hall effect of a single layer is indeed robust against weak interlayer tunneling , and suggested that , within a quantum hall plateau , interlayer conductivity in the bulk vanishes in the low - temperature limit .",
    "subsequent theoretical discussions @xcite drew attention to the unusual nature of surface states in multilayer quantum hall systems , and some aspects of the theory of the chiral metal have since been explored in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "recent experiments by druist _",
    "et al _ have isolated the contribution of surface states to vertical transport @xcite and demonstrated that mesoscopic conductance fluctuations offer a way to study inelastic scattering in the chiral metal @xcite .",
    "conduction by surface states has also been invoked in the interpretation of further experiments on semiconductor multilayer samples @xcite , and on the bulk quantum hall effect in both organic conductors @xcite and an inorganic quasi - two dimensional conductor @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the theoretical treatment of mesoscopic chiral conductors in two respects .",
    "first , we develop some aspects of the theory of conductance fluctuations which we hope will be useful for the interpretation of experiments .",
    "second , we study electron - electron interactions in the dirty chiral metal .",
    "the existing understanding of conductance fluctuations in the chiral metal is based on calculations @xcite for the variance of sample - to - sample conductance fluctuations in systems that are fully phase - coherent . from the results of those calculations",
    ", estimates have been made @xcite for the variance of conductance fluctuations measured as a function of magnetic field in samples that are only partially phase - coherent , and also for the range in magnetic field of conductance correlations .",
    "these estimates determine the relevant scales but do not yield numerical coefficients or functional forms .",
    "moreover , they depend on a continuum treatment of the system of coupled edge states , and apply if the inelastic scattering rate , @xmath3 is smaller than the inter - edge tunneling rate , @xmath5 , while existing experiments appear to be in the opposite regime @xcite .",
    "we supplement this past work by calculating in full the conductance correlation function @xmath2 , both for @xmath9 and for @xmath10 .    separately",
    ", we consider conductance as a function of fermi energy . for conventional disordered conductors , changes in fermi energy provide a way to sample the conductance distribution .",
    "in contrast , we find that the conductance of a partially - coherent chiral metal sample , though dependent on the disorder realisation , is unchanged by small variations in fermi energy .",
    "one consequence is that thermal smearing of the electron distribution function does not decrease the amplitude of conductance fluctuations in the chiral metal .    turning to electron - electron interactions",
    ", we establish the form of the dynamically screened interaction and examine some of its consequences .",
    "most importantly , we calculate the inelastic scattering rate due to electron - electron interactions , obtaining @xmath6 for @xmath11 .",
    "we also examine other interaction effects which are known to be of interest in conventional disordered conductors@xcite .",
    "interactions in diffusive metals are responsible for a zero - bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states @xcite , but  as noted previously @xcite , and as we confirm  this is absent from the chiral metal .",
    "similarly , the leading interaction contribution to the mean conductance has a singular temperature dependence in conventional disordered conductors @xcite , but we find that it cancels in the chiral metal .",

    "we denote the interlayer spacing by @xmath12 , the chiral velocity by @xmath13 and the interlayer diffusion constant by @xmath14 .",

    "take the number of layers to be @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "two intrinsic length scales arise , with which @xmath18 should be compared .",
    "the first of these involves the mean conductance of the sample , which if ohm s law applies is @xmath22 : the quasi one - dimensional localisation length , @xmath23 , is the value of @xmath18 at which @xmath24 is of order the quantum unit of conductance . samples with",
    "@xmath25 have states localised in the vertical direction and are quasi one - dimensional insulators .",
    "samples with @xmath26 are metallic and have ohmic dependence of @xmath24 on sample dimensions .",
    "a second length scale influences the amplitude of conductance fluctuations .",
    "it is the distance @xmath27 that an electron diffuses in the transverse direction during the time taken to circumnavigate the sample : @xmath28 .",
    "samples with @xmath29 are quasi one - dimensional metals without time - reversal symmetry and , in common with other examples of such systems , have a variance for the conductance of @xmath30",
    ". samples with @xmath31 are two - dimensional chiral metals . if contacts are attached to these samples for conductance measurements , electrons will escape by diffusion to the contacts before completing a circuit of the sample in the chiral direction . as a result",
    ", multiple scattering of an electron from a given impurity is completely supressed .",
    "such samples present a number of essentially independent parallel strips for conduction in the transverse direction , each having a width in the chiral direction given by the distance an electron propagates before reaching a contact .",
    "this width is @xmath32 .",
    "the conductance of the two - dimensional chiral metal may be thought of @xcite as a sum of contributions from each such strip , and its variance has the value @xcite @xmath33 .",
    "our concern in the following is with samples that are not completely phase coherent .",
    "they have two different metallic regimes , analogous to those described above for phase coherent conductors .",
    "we restrict our attention to one of these , the incoherent two - dimensional metal , in which @xmath34 so that dephasing occurs before circumnavigation : this is the simpler regime theoretically and seems the one relevant for existing experiments .",
    "cho , balents and fisher @xcite have estimated the size of conductance fluctuations in the incoherent metal by viewing each phase - coherent region as a classical resistor and the whole sample as a random resistor network .",

    "if @xmath7 so that the phase coherence length in the transverse direction is much larger than the layer spacing , which is the case considered previously @xcite , then one expects a continuum treatment of the system to be adequate . in this case ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 ; in addition , @xmath50 . combining these expressions and introducing the inelastic scattering length in the chiral direction , @xmath51 ,",
    "one arrives at the conclusion ( eq.(4.1 ) of ref . ) that @xmath52 experimental studies use a magnetic field with a component normal to the sample surface to generate conductance fluctuations in the chiral metal @xcite ; the field scale of conductance correlations is set by the flux quantum , @xmath53 , and the area of a coherent region , being ( eq.(4.4 ) of ref . ) @xmath54 the results we obtain in sec.iii substitute for eqns.([fluc1 ] ) and ( [ fluc2 ] ) the correlation function @xmath55 where the function @xmath56 is @xmath57 with the scaling variable @xmath58    the opposite limit of weakly coupled edges , @xmath59 , has not previously been examined theoretically but seems to be important experimentally @xcite . adapting the argument outlined above , we take , as elements of a classical resistor network , regions again of length @xmath60 in the chiral direction but now of width @xmath12 in the transverse direction",

    "the same scattering processes are responsible for a difference , in diffusive two - dimensional metals , between the temperature dependence of the inelastic ( or out - scattering ) rate , which acts as a cut - off for conductance fluctuations , and the dephasing rate , which acts as a cut - off for the weak localisation effects that result in negative magnetoresistance . in the chiral metal , as for conventional , diffusive metals in more than two dimensions , small energy transfer processes are not dominant and there is a single relaxation rate .",

    "we set the energy and wavevector differences , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , at the vertex to zero , express sums on matsubara frequencies as contour integrals , and combine terms .",
    "we expect that the dominant contribution to the resulting integral will be from small wavevectors and energies , and use the asymptotic form of the integrand appropriate for this regime , obtaining @xmath236 \\times \\\\ \\frac{x(\\hbar d { q_{z}}^2)^2}{[(x+\\hbar v q_{x})^2 + ( \\hbar d { q_{z}}^2)^2 ] [ ( \\hbar vq_{x})^2 + ( \\hbar d { q_{z}}^2)^2 ] } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dependence of this expression on @xmath8 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 is made apparent by introducing the scaled variables : @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "the integral can be evaluated numerically , yielding the expression for @xmath240 given in eq.([t_in ] ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result has been discussed in sec.ii .",
    "2      electron - electron interactions are known in diffusive conductors to give rise to temperature - dependent contributions to the conductivity that are singular in the low - temperature limit @xcite the origin of these interaction corrections to the conductivity is similar to that of the zero - bias anomaly in the tunneling density of states .",
    "since the chiral metal has no zero - bias anomaly , one expects it to have no singular interaction contribution to the conductivity . in the following subsection",
    "we outline calculations that confirm this at leading order .",
    "the presentation follows closely that of altshuler , khmelnitskii , larkin , and lee @xcite for the diffusive metal .    to compute the interaction correction to the conductivity of the chiral metal using the matsubara technique",
    ", it is convenient to use the kubo formula in the form @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the analytic continuation in @xmath234 of @xmath243 ) j_z g(i\\epsilon_m)]\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] the diagrams that contribute to @xmath244 at leading order in the screened interaction strength can be classified according to the number of diffusion propagators each one contains .",
    "those with the most diffusion propagators are most singular in the low - temperature limit .",
    "they can be separated into two categories .",
    "diagrams in the first category are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : types ] , corresponding to figs.5(a ) , 5(b ) and 5(c ) of ref .. it has been shown for a diffusive conductor in ref . that these cancel , and we find the same to be true in the chiral metal .",
    "diagrams in the second category are illustrated in fig.[fig : twodiag ] , corresponding to figs.5(d ) and 5(e ) of ref .. for the two - dimensional diffusive metal , these diagrams make a contribution to the conductivity which is logarithmic in temperature . for the chiral metal , their contribution is formally proportional to @xmath245 , but with a numerical coefficient which we find to be zero after integrating over the component in the chiral direction of the momentum transferred by the interaction .    2",
    "our results , as set out in sec .",
    "ii , are a contribution to the understanding of transport in the chiral metal . in many senses , it is a particularly simple example of a disordered conductor .",
    "quantum interference effects are suppressed by chiral motion , and interaction effects are less singular than in diffusive two - dimensional conductors .",
    "we have provided a rather detailed treatment of conductance fluctations , which we hope will be tested experimentally .",
    "we have also identified a distinct mesoscopic regime , for weakly coupled edges , in which the inter - edge tunneling rate , @xmath5 , is smaller than the inelastic scattering rate , @xmath3 . in this regime",
    ", transport is controlled by the properties of an isolated , one - dimensional chiral metal .",
    "recent experiments @xcite appear , in fact , to probe behaviour of weakly coupled edges , though their analysis has necessarily so far been based on theory for the opposite regime . according to that analysis , the inelastic scattering length in the transverse direction , estimated from the variance of conductance fluctuations using eq.([fluc1 ] ) ,",
    "is shorter than the inter - layer spacing , even at the lowest temperatures investigated .",
    "moreover , this estimate of the inelastic scattering length is inconsistent with the value deduced from the correlation field for condcutance fluctuations , using eq.([fluc2 ] ) , as one might expect if the theory used is , in fact , inappropriate . it will be interesting to find whether these discrepancies are resolved by using the theory we have presented to analyse the experiments .",
    "if so , such measurements provide a way to investigate interaction effects in a one - dimensional system of chiral fermions .",
