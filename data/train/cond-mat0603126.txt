    "patterned ferromagnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as has shown several fascinating magnetic properties on the sub - micrometer or nanometer length scale.@xcite our previous work on the magnetoresistance clearly showed that the magnetic domain configurations of micro - patterned ( ga , mn)as wires can be controlled by changing the shape anisotropy through modification of the hole concentration,@xcite and therefore the magnetic shape anisotropy was found to play a crucial role in the formation process of the magnetic domain configurations . in general views , it is believed that static magnetic energetics provide a qualitative explanation for such magnetic domain configuration , based on the total magnetostatic energy expressed as@xcite @xmath0 where _ k@xmath1 _ , _",

    "@xcite in fact , numerical calculation using this formalism is in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , if ( ga , mn)as is used as a potential material for spin electronic devices in a temperature variable environment , the formalism should be amended so as to include temperature variation in the anisotropy constants because the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of ( ga , mn)as significantly changes with temperature:@xcite the temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy was found to have a great effect on the domain configurations and magnetization reversal processes in ( ga , mn)as.@xcite therefore , of most essence in designing and manipulating the magnetic configuration is to understand the relative relationship between the intrinsic anisotropy and the shape anisotropy as a function of temperature .    in this paper , we examine the effect of the shape anisotropy on the magnetic domain configuration as a function of temperature in a micro - patterned ( ga , mn)as epilayer . magnetotransport measurements and numerical calculation reveal that the contribution of the shape anisotropy is enhanced with increasing temperature opposed to a reduction in the magnetization with temperature .",
    "this behavior can be understood as a steep decrease in the relative contribution of @xmath4 cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy which is intrinsic to zinc - blende ( ga , mn)as . we demonstrate that competition between the @xmath4 cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the shape anisotropy along [ 100 ] occurs far below the curie temperature of ( ga , mn)as .    _ @xmath7 500 erg/@xmath8 and ( b ) _",

    "we hereafter show experimental data on the magnetization reversal processes of a wire sample with a width of 1.5 @xmath19 m as a function of temperature .",
    "figure 2 depicts the mr curves of the wire at various temperatures in magnetic fields perpendicular ( @xmath21 ) or parallel ( @xmath20 ) to the wire axis .",
    "the mr curves at 10 k show a very small hysteretic feature and no steep mr jumps for @xmath20 , while a clear hysteretic behavior is observed for @xmath21 .",
    "according to the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) of ( ga , mn)as , the mr shows a maximum when the magnetization direction is perpendicular to current flow ( wire axis),@xcite indicating that the magnetization direction remains along the wire axis for @xmath20 , whereas the magnetization switches between parallel and perpendicular to the wire axis for @xmath21 . with increasing temperature from 10 k to 20 k , the mr features change strikingly as shown in fig .",
    "2 . the remanent magnetization direction tends to align along the wire axis even for @xmath21 at 15 k and consequently the remanent magnetization for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 aligns along the wire axis at 20 k. these results indicate that the effect of the shape anisotropy is likely to overcome the intrinsic magnetic anisotropies within this very narrow temperature region and the magnetic configuration is potentially controlled through a slight change in the external environment .",
    "also , we note that the effect of the shape anisotropy on the magnetic domain configuration is becoming pronounced in spite of a reduction in the magnetization , which generally decreases shape anisotropy .        in order to explore a possible cause of the characteristic variation in the mr described above",

    "it is seen that the curve shown by the closed circles merges with the curve shown by the open circles at around 20 k , accompanied with an abrupt reduction in the resistance near 17 k , indicating that the contribution of _ k@xmath3 _ along [ 100 ] becomes significant at 17 k. this behavior also implies that the contribution of _",
    "k@xmath2 _ is significantly reduced far below the @xmath18@xmath2 of 60 k. from these results , the shape anisotropy plays a predominant role in the formation of magnetic domain configurations above 17 k , although the origin of the rapid decrease in the _ k@xmath2 _ with increasing temperature is still unclear : recent studies also have discussed a rapid decrease in the _ k@xmath2 _ for in - plane magnetized ( ga , mn)as.@xcite to understand more details of the magnetic anisotropy for in - plane magnetized ( ga , mn)as epilayers , further study is required taking microscopic magnetic information including magnetic inhomogeneity as suggested in our previous report @xcite into account .",
    "we have examined temperature variation in the shape anisotropy and its effect on the magnetic configuration of a patterned ( ga , mn)as structure using magnetoresistance measurements . the relative contribution of the shape anisotropy is found to be significantly enhanced with increasing temperature due to a reduction in the cubic magnetic anisotropy far below the curie temperature . the information shown here is the first clear manifestation of the importance of the temperature variation in the magnetic shape anisotropy for designing magnetic devices with ( ga , mn)as on the sub - micrometer length scale .",
