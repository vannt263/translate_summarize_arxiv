    "we obtain the following equality of @xmath345-modules @xmath876 put @xmath877 , apply lemma  [ lemma : jacquet functor without character ] to each summand and obtain , as @xmath562-modules , @xmath878 here we used @xmath879 .",
    "this equality yields the following identity of @xmath880-modules , @xmath881 thus for some @xmath498 , @xmath882        the claim and immediately imply @xmath887 for all @xmath883 . now if @xmath21 is odd , we deduce @xmath888 ( ! ) . in the even case we find @xmath889 and according to our assumption ( ! ! ) @xmath799 , we obtain @xmath890 .",
