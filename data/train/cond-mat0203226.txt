    "modification of electronic properties of condensed systems by an applied external pressure or strain in the elastic range have been subject of active study .",
    "however , in most of the cases , the changes one can induce by the elastic deformation is minute even negligible due to the rigidity of the crystals . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is rather different for single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnts ) owing to their tubular geometry .",
    "swnts are highly flexible and have a very large young s modulus .",
    "they sustain remarkable elastic deformations , and it has been shown that the structure and electronic properties undergo dramatic changes by the these deformations . similarly , significant radial deformation of swnts can be realized in the elastic range , whereby the curvature is locally changed .",
    "this way , zones with higher and lower curvatures relative to the undeformed swnt can be attained on the same circumference .",
    "hence , one expects that radial deformation can induce important modifications in the electronic and conduction properties of nanotubes.@xcite    tight - binding calculations have indicated that a swnt may undergo an insulator - metal transition under a uniaxial or torsional strain  @xcite .",
    "multiprobe transport experiments  @xcite on individual swnts showed that the electronic structure can be modified by bending the tube , or by applying a circumferential deformation .",
    "empirical extended hckel calculations  @xcite predicted that the conductance of an armchair swnt can be affected by the circumferential deformations and a band gap can develop on a metallic armchair swnt upon twisting .",
    "the effect of the radial deformation and squeezing have been investigated by using various methods.@xcite however , in spite of these theoretical studies@xcite , a systematic analysis of the effect of the radial deformation on the electrical properties has not been carried out yet .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the effect of radial deformation on the electronic band structure and elastic properties of swnts , based on the extensive first - principle ( _ ab - initio _ ) total energy and electronic structure calculations with fully optimized structures . in the next section",

    "the first principles total energy and electronic structure calculations have been performed using the pseudopotential plane wave method  @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite .",

    "we used a tetragonal supercell with lattice constants , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the lattice constants , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are chosen such that the interaction between nearest neighbor tubes is negligible ( the minimum cc distance between two nearest neighbor tubes is taken as 6.2   ) .",
    "the lattice constant along the axis of the tube , @xmath3 , is taken to be equal to the 1d lattice parameter , @xmath4 , of the tube .",
    "the tube axis is taken along the @xmath5direction , and the circular crosssection lies in the @xmath6plane . in the 1d brillouin zone ( bz ) ,",
    "the wave vector @xmath7 varies only along the @xmath5axis .",
    "plane waves up to an energy cutoff of 500 ev are used . with this energy cutoff and using ultra soft pseudopotentials for carbon atoms  @xcite ,",
    "the total energy converges within 0.5 mev / atom .",
    "in addition to this , finite basis set corrections@xcite are also included .",
    "owing to the very large lattice constants of the supercell , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath8point sampling is done only along the tube axis .",
    "the monkhorst - pack special @xmath8point scheme@xcite with with 0.02 @xmath9 k - point spacing resulting 5 and 10 * k*-points within the irreducible bz of the tetragonal supercell are used for @xmath10 and @xmath11 tubes , respectively .",
    "the radial deformation that is treated in this study is generated by applying uniaxial compressive stress @xmath12 on a narrow strip on the surface of a swnt . in practice",
    "such a deformation can be realized by pressing the tube between two rigid and flat surfaces . as a result",
    ", the radius is squeezed in the @xmath13direction , while it is elongated along the @xmath14direction , and hence the circular cross section is distorted to the elliptical one with major and minor axis @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . a natural variable to describe",
    "the radial deformation is the magnitude of the applied strain along the two axes @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the undeformed ( zero strain ) nanotube .",
    "we note that the point group of the undeformed nanotubes is @xmath20 or @xmath21 for @xmath22 even or odd , respectively . under radial deformation described above",

    "however , depending on the nanotube orientation around the tube axes the in - plane mirror symmetry can be broken . for the @xmath25 tube",
    ", we studied several different orientations in order to investigate the effect of mirror symmetry on the band crossing at the fermi level .",

    ", we carried out full structural optimization under the constraint that the minor axis was kept fixed at a preset value .",
    "the strains are in the elastic range , since the deformed tubes relax back to the undeformed state when the applied strain is removed .",
    "the structural relaxation is done in following steps : first , depending on rotational orientation of the swnt , either a single bond or a carbon atom at both ends of the minor axis are pressed towards each other by @xmath30 and are kept fixed .",
    "then , under this constraint , the coordinates of the remaining atoms and the lattice parameter of the tube @xmath4 are optimized . at this step ,",
    "some resultant forces remain on the fixed atom(s ) with components opposite to the applied strain as well as perpendicular to it . in the second step",
    ", the fixed bond lengths are optimized together with all the internal coordinates of the atoms and @xmath4 parameter . eventually , in the final fully relaxed structure the only remaining force is the restoring force , opposite to the applied strain , on the fixed atoms .",
    "all other force components on these fixed carbon atoms and all the forces on the rest of carbon atoms are optimized to be less than @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig : geom ] shows the crosssectional view perpendicular to the tube axis of the fully optimized undistorted and distorted swnts as well as the restoring force vector .",
    "figure  [ fig : pairdist]a shows the pair distribution function in a deformed and undeformed ( 7,0 ) swnt .",
    "the first peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]a corresponds to the first nearest neighbor distance , which is slightly broadened without a shift of the peak position with deformation .",
    "this indicates that the cc bond lengths ( @xmath32 1.41   ) are practically unaltered under the applied strain .",
    "similarly , the second peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]a is also slightly broadened , indicating a small effect of the distortion on the second nearest neighbor distances .",
    "the effect of the radial deformation becomes apparent only for the third and further nearest neigbor distances .",
    "solid line is for undeformed swnt while the dotted line is for radially deformed one . ]",
    "given that first and second nearest neighbor distances did not change significantly with the radial deformation , the only remaining degrees of freedom is the bond angle as clearly seen from the angular distribution function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pairdist]b .",
    "the main peak around @xmath33 does not change with applied strain , but the other peak a few degrees below the main peak for undeformed tube splits into @xmath34 new peaks where @xmath34 is the number of peaks in the radius distribution of zigzag @xmath35 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 swnts . on the other hand , for the armchair ( 6,6 ) swnt , although the main peak is not changed with strain , the second peak is broadened by a few degrees .",
    "one direct consequences of this observation is that for zigzag tubes the lattice parameter @xmath4 decreases very slightly with radial strain , whereas it is almost constant for the ( 6,6 ) swnt .    in summary",
    ", the radial deformation does not have a noticeable effect on the first and second nearest neighbor cc distances but it induces significant changes in the bond angles .",
    "this observation is therefore important and has to be taken into account in tight binding studies of swnts with radial deformation .       along the major axis as a function of applied strain @xmath37 .",

    "@xcite showed that the @xmath64-conduction and @xmath57-valence bands of a @xmath65 tube which normally cross at the fermi level with quasi linear dispersion , open a pseudogap in the range of @xmath66 ev at certain directions of the bz perpendicular to the axis of the tube owing to tube - tube interactions in a rope .",

    "et al_.  @xcite , the bandgap of the @xmath69 tube were monotonically increasing probably due to bilayer interactions , since the separation of the two nearest wall of the tube became comparable to the interlayer distance of graphite .",
    "in order to explain the band gap variation of @xmath10 tubes , the energies of a few bands near the band gap are plotted as a function of strain in fig .  [",
    "fig : bandab ] .",
    "the singlet @xmath64state in the conduction band shifts downwards in energy much faster than the other states do with increasing strain .",
    "this is due to the increasing curvature with increasing radial deformation .",
    "since the singlet @xmath70state lies below the double degenerate @xmath70states for both @xmath35 and @xmath0 swnt s , their band gaps are closed monotonically with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath36 swnt this singlet @xmath70state is above the double degenerate @xmath70states .",
    "the increase of the band gap at the initial stages of radial deformation is connected with relatively higher rate of downward shift of the double degenerate @xmath57valence band relative to the @xmath64conduction band under low strains . once the singlet @xmath64band , which shows faster decrease with strain , crosses the doublet conduction band and enters into the gap , the band gap begins to decrease with increasing strain .    finally , we examined the effect of the radial deformation on the charge density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] we show the charge density of states near the band edges .",
    "the effect of the deformation is remarkable on the singlet state ; charge moves from the low curvature regions to the high curvature regions as the strain is increased .",
    "significant charge rearrangements with radial deformation can modify the chemical activity of the surface of the swnt relative to foreign atoms and molecules . since",
    "a swnt can sustain large elastic deformations , it allows significant charge rearrangements on its surface .",

    "it is clear from the above discussion that the band gap of an insulating swnt can be modified , and even an insulator - metal transition can be induced by radial deformation in the elastic range .",
    "if the applied deformation is not uniform but has different strength at different zones of the tube , it renders variable electronic structure along the tube axis .",
    "for example , each zone of an individual swnt undergoing different radial deformation attains a different band gap . owing to the band off - sets at the junction",
    ", quantum structures can be engineered on an individual tube .",
    "experimental and theoretical methods have been proposed in the past to determine the band offsets , and hence to reveal the band diagram perpetuating along the superlattice axis  @xcite .",
    "however , there are some ambiguities in the case of swnt superlattices @xmath71 , which are formed by periodically repeating undeformed @xmath42 regions ( of @xmath22 unit cells ) and radially deformed @xmath72 regions ( of @xmath73 unit cells ) : ( i ) the alignment of the valence and conduction bands of the @xmath42 and @xmath72 regions and the resulting band - lineup is a complex process involving charge transfer between @xmath42 and @xmath72 , and also modification of the crystal potential in the deformed region .",
    "in fact , the above analysis of radial deformation has shown that the valence and conduction band edges can be lowered when a zigzag swnt is radially deformed .",
    "therefore , a realistic treatment of the band alignment requires self - consistent calculation of the crystal potential .",
