    ".15 cm    before describing in details the contribution of the paper , let us recast the state of the art on the topic . among others , the problem of slow dynamics for the burgers equation has been examined in @xcite and in @xcite , where different approaches have been considered .",
    "the former is based either on _ projection method _ or on _ wkb expansions _ ; the latter stands on an adapted version of the _ method of matched asymptotics expansion_. the common aim is to determine an expression and/or an equation for the parameter @xmath55 , considered as a function of time , describing the movement of the transition from a generic point of the interval @xmath56 toward the equilibrium location @xmath57 . in both the contributions , the analysis is conducted at a formal level and validated numerically by means of comparision with significant computations . a rigorous analysis has been performed in @xcite ( and generalized to the case of nonconvex flux in @xcite ) , where one - parameter family of reference functions is chosen as a family of traveling wave solutions to the viscous equation satisfying the boundary conditions and with non - zero ( but small ) velocity .",
    "the approach is based on the use of such traveling waves to obtain upper and lower estimates by the maximum principle , from which rigorous asymptotic formulae for the slow velocity are obtained .",
    "slow motion for the viscous burgers equation in unbounded domains has been also considered in literature . in @xcite , it is analyzed the case of the half - line @xmath58 for the space variable @xmath7 , with constant initial and boundary data chosen so that speed of the shock generated at @xmath59 is stationary for the corresponding hyperbolic equation .",
    "the presence of the viscosity generates a motion of the transition layer , which is precisely identified by means of the lambert s @xmath60 function .",
    "later , the ( slow ) motion of a shock wave , with zero hyperbolic speed , for the burgers equation in the quarter plane has been considered in @xcite , where it is shown that the location of the wave front is of order @xmath61 ; the same result has been generalized in @xcite in the case of general fluxes ( for other contributions to the same problem , we refer also to @xcite ) .",
    "the case of the whole real line has been examined in @xcite with emphasis on the generation of @xmath62wave like structures and their evolution towards nonlinear diffusion waves .",
    "the analysis is based on the use of self - similar variables , suggested by the invariance of the burgers equation under the group of transformations @xmath63 ( for subsequent contributions in the same direction , see @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , it has been shown in @xcite that the slow motion is determined by the presence of a one - dimensional center manifold of steady states for the equation in the self - similar variables ( corresponding to the diffusion waves ) and a relative family of one - dimensional global attractive invariant manifold . in a short - time scale , the solution approaches one of the attractive manifolds and remains close to it in a long - time scale .",
    "at the present day , results relative to metastability in the case of systems appear to be rare .",
    "slow dynamics analysis for systems of conservation laws have been considered in @xcite , basic model examples being the navier - stokes equations of compressible viscous heat conductive fluid and the keyfitz - kranzer system , arising in elasticity .",
    "the approach is based on asymptotic expansions and consists in deriving appropriate limiting equations for the leading order terms , in the case of periodic data . in @xcite , the problem of proving convergence to a stationary solution for a system of conservation laws with viscosity",
    "is addressed , with an approach based on a detailed analysis of the linearized operator at the steady state .",
    "a recent contribution is the reference @xcite , where the authors consider the saint - venant equations for shallow water and , precisely , the phenomenon of formation of roll - waves .",
    "the approach merges together analytical techniques and numerical results to present some intriguing properties relative to the dynamics of solitary wave pulses .",
    ".15 cm    summing up , apart for the formal expansions methods , the rigorous approaches used in the literature are largely based on typical scalar equations features .",
    "the first of these properties is the direct link between the scalar burgers equation and the heat equation given by the hopf  cole transformation : @xmath64 , and the consequent invariance of the burgers equation under the group of scaling transformations @xmath63 .",
    "on the one hand , the presence of such a connection is an evident advantage , since it permits to determine optimal descriptions for the behavior under study ( see @xcite ) ; on the other hand , to use such exceptional property makes the approach very stiff and difficult to apply to more general cases .",
    "a different `` scalar hallmark '' is the base of the approach considered in @xcite , where the authors make wide use of maximum principle and comparison arguments , taking benefit from the fact that the equation is second - order parabolic .    in order to extend the results to more general settings and specifically for systems of pdes",
    ", it is useful to determine strategies and techniques that are more flexible , paying , if necessary , the price of a less accurate description of the dynamics .",
    "a contribution in this direction has been given in @xcite , where the location of the shock transition for a scalar conservation law in the quarter plane has been proved by means of weighted energy estimates , extending the result proved in @xcite , that used an explicit formula determined by means of the hopf ",
    "cole transformation for the green function of the linearization at the shock profile of the burgers equation . .15",
    "cm    the present article intends to contribute to the definition of a versatile language for metastability , suitable for general class of partial differential equations of evolutive type . with this direction in mind",
    ", we follow an approach that it is strictly related with the _ projection method _ considered in @xcite and we go behind the philosophy tracked in the analysis of stability of viscous shock waves by k.zumbrun and co - authors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "precisely , we separate three distinct phases :    to choose a family of functions @xmath65 , considered as approximate solutions , and to measure how far they are from being exact solutions ; + to investigate spectral properties of the linearized operators at such states ; + to show that appropriate assumptions on the approximate solutions ( step * i * ) and on the spectrum of the linearized operators ( step * ii * ) imply the appearance of a metastable behavior . .15 cm    with respect to the framework of shock waves stability analysis , there are two main differences .",
    "first of all , we concentrate on the case of bounded domains and , therefore , the spectrum of the linearized operators is discrete . additionally , since the reference states @xmath66 are approximate solutions , the perturbations of such states satisfy at first order a _ non - homogeneous _ linear equation , with forcing term negligible as @xmath16 .",
    "the defect of working in a neighborhood of a manifold that is not invariant has the counterpart of a wider flexibility in its construction that leads , in particular , to ( more or less ) explicit representations .",
    "thus , it should be possible in principle to obtain numerical evidence of special spectral properties even in cases where analytical results appear to be not achievable .",
    "the article is organized as follows . to start with , in section [ sect : abs ] , we consider a general framework containing scalar viscous conservation laws as a very specific case . given a family of approximate solutions @xmath67 ,",
    "our approach consists in representing the solution to the initial - bondary value problem as the sum of an element @xmath68 moving along the family @xmath67 plus a perturbation term @xmath5 .",
    "the equation for the unknown @xmath2 is chosen in such a way that the slower decaying terms in the perturbation @xmath5 are canceled out . in order to state a general result",
    ", we consider an approximation of the complete nonlinear equations for the couple @xmath69 , obtained by disregarding quadratic terms in @xmath5 and keeping the nonlinear dependence on @xmath55 , in order to keep track of the nonlinear evolution along the manifold @xmath67 .",
    "such reduced system for @xmath70 is called quasi - linearized system and it is the concern of theorem [ thm : metal ] , the main contribution of the paper . under appropriate assumptions on the manifold @xmath66 , the linearized operators at such states , and the coupling between the two objects , such result gives an explicit representation for the solution to the evolutive problem together with an estimate on the remainder , vanishing in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "this gives a sound justification to the reduced equation for the unknown @xmath2 obtainable by neglecting also the linear term in @xmath5 .",
    "dealing with the complete system for the couple @xmath70 brings into the analysis also the specific form of the quadratic terms . as a consequence , in case of parabolic systems of reaction - diffusion type , we expect that a results analogous to theorem [ thm : metal ] could be proved , under the assumption of an _ a priori _ @xmath71 bound on the solution .",
    "differently , when a nonlinear first order space derivative term is present ( as is the case for viscous conservation laws ) , the quadratic term involve a dependence on the space derivative of the solution and a rigorous result needs an additional bound , which we are not presently able to achieve .",
    "in section [ sect : appl ] we consider the application of the general framework to the case of viscous scalar conservation laws .",
    "firstly , we present the dynamics of the hyperbolic equation obtained in the vanishing viscosity limit , proving a result on finite - time convergence to the one - parameter manifold of steady states ( theorem [ thm : stabhyp ] ) . then , we pass to consider the parabolic equation in under assumption and we build up a specific family @xmath67 by matching continuously stationary solutions at a given point @xmath55 . to apply the general result of section [ sect : abs ] , we need to measure how far are states @xmath66 from being stationary solutions , and this amounts in estimating the jump of the space derivative at the matching point .",
    "such task is completed , showing that the residual has order @xmath72 , hence it is exponentially small in the limit @xmath16 . as a by - product , we deduce a formal equation for the motion of the shock layer , which generalizes the one known for the case of the burgers flux @xmath73 .    in section",
    "[ sect : spec ] , we analyze spectral properties of the diffusion - transport linear operator , arising from the linearization at the state @xmath74 .",
    "we show that , under appropriate assumption on the limiting behavior of @xmath66 as @xmath16 , the spectrum can be decomposed into two parts : the first eigenvalue of order @xmath75 ; all of the remaining eigenvalues are less than @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 denotes a generic positive constant independent on @xmath15 ) .",
    "additionally , precise asymptotics for the first eigenvalue are achieved by considering the linear operator with piecewise constant coefficient , obtained by taking the limit of functions @xmath74 as @xmath16 .",
