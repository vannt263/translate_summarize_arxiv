    "the totem experiment  @xcite is dedicated to the total proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) cross - section measurement using the luminosity - independent method , which requires a detailed measurement of the elastic scattering rate down to a squared four - momentum transfer of @xmath2 together with the measurements of the total inelastic and elastic rates .",
    "furthermore , by studying elastic scattering with momentum transfers up to 10 gev@xmath3 , and via a comprehensive study of diffractive processes  partly in cooperation with cms  @xcite , located at the same interaction point , totem s physics programme aims at a deeper understanding of the proton structure . to perform these measurements , totem requires a good acceptance for particles produced at small and even tiny angles with respect to the beams .",
    "totem s coverage in the pseudo - rapidity range of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) on both sides of the interaction point ( ip ) is accomplished by two telescopes , t1 and t2 ( figure  [ fig_apparatus ] , top ) , for the detection of charged particles with emission angles between a few and about hundred milliradians .",
    "this is complemented by detectors in special movable beam - pipe insertions  so called roman pots ( rp )  placed at about 147 m and 220 m from the ip , designed to detect elastically or diffractively scattered protons at merely a few millimeter from the beam center corresponding to emission angles down to a few microradians ( figure  [ fig_apparatus ] , bottom ) .    for the luminosity - independent total cross - section measurement ,",
    "totem has to reach the lowest possible @xmath0 values in elastic @xmath1 scattering .",
    "elastically scattered protons close to the beam can be detected downstream on either side of the ip if the displacement at the detector location is large enough and if the beam divergence at the ip is small compared to the scattering angle . to achieve these conditions special lhc optics with high beta value at the ip ( @xmath6 )",
    "are required : the larger the @xmath6 , the smaller the beam divergence ( @xmath7 ) will be .",
    "two optics are proposed : an ultimate one with @xmath8 m and another one , possibly foreseen for 2009 , with @xmath9 m . the latter uses the standard injection optics ( @xmath6 = 11 m ) and beam conditions typical for early lhc running : zero degree crossing - angle and consequently at most 156 bunches together with a low number of protons per bunch .",
    "the versatile physics programme of totem requires different running scenarios that have to be adapted to the lhc commissioning and operation in the first years .",
    "a flexible trigger can be provided by the two telescopes and the roman pot detectors .",
    "totem will take data under all optics conditions , adjusting the trigger schemes to the luminosity .",
    "the daq will allow trigger rates up to a few khz without involving a higher level trigger .",
    "the high-@xmath6 runs ( table  [ tab_par ] ) with 156 bunches , zero degree crossing - angle and maximum luminosity between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , will concentrate on low-@xmath0 elastic scattering , total cross - section , minimum bias physics and soft diffraction . a large fraction of forward protons will be detected even at the lowest @xmath12 values .",
    "low-@xmath6 runs ( table  [ tab_par ] ) with more bunches and higher luminosity ( @xmath13  @xmath14 ) will be used for large-@xmath0 elastic scattering and diffractive studies with @xmath15 .",
    "hard diffractive events come within reach .",
    "in addition , early low @xmath6 runs will provide first opportunities for measurements of soft diffraction at lhc energies and for studies of forward charged multiplicity .",
    ".running scenarios at different lhc optics ( @xmath16 : number of bunches , @xmath17 : number of particles per bunch , @xmath18 : estimated luminosity ) . the @xmath0 ranges for elastically scattered protons correspond to the @xmath19% combined rp147 and rp220 acceptance . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the largest contribution to the uncertainty on @xmath20 at @xmath6 = 90 m comes from the extrapolation of @xmath21 to @xmath22 ; mainly due to systematics in the @xmath23-measurement from uncertainties in @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see eq.[eqn_coord ] ) .",
    "this contribution will be reduced to 0.1 % at @xmath6 = 1540 m requiring , however , an improved knowledge of @xmath24 and @xmath25 and a rp alignment precision of better than 50 @xmath26 m .",
    "the dominating uncertainty , 0.2 % , will then be due to the model - dependent extrapolation procedure . for @xmath6",
    "= 1540 m , the largest contribution to the @xmath20 uncertainty will most likely come from @xmath27 , mainly from trigger losses in single and double diffractive events .",
    "the lost events , corresponding to @xmath28 3 mb , have very low diffractive mass @xmath29 ( below @xmath28 10gev / c@xmath3 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all particles have pseudo - rapidities beyond the t2 acceptance and hence escape detection of the single arm trigger . to obtain the total inelastic rate , the fraction of events lost due to the incomplete angular coverage is estimated by extrapolating the reconstructed @xmath30 distribution . the uncertainty on @xmath27 after corrections is estimated to be 0.8 and 1 % for @xmath6 = 1540 and 90 m optics , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath31 parameter as estimated from lower energy measurement  @xcite gives a @xmath20 uncertainty of 1.3 % .",
    "a reduction is expected when @xmath31 is measured at the lhc via the interference between coulomb and nuclear contributions to the elastic scattering cross - section  @xcite .    at an early stage in 2009 with non - optimal beams and @xmath6 = 90 m",
    ", totem will measure @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) with a 45 % ( 7 % ) relative precision .",
    "after having understood the initial measurements and with improved beams at @xmath32 m , a final relative precision on @xmath20 ( @xmath18 ) of 1 % ( 2% ) should be achievable .",
    "the early runs at the lhc start will be characterized by low @xmath6 beams with a reduced number of bunches and a lower number of protons per bunch . under these conditions",
    "diffractive protons in the @xmath12 range of 0.02 - 0.2 will be within the acceptance of rp220 giving totem ample opportunities to make first soft diffractive studies .",
    "the early physics programme of totem in stand - alone runs will concentrate on measurements of individual cross - sections and event topologies for the following processes :    * central diffractive events with diffractive masses between @xmath28 250 gev and @xmath28 2.8 tev ; * single diffractive events with diffractive masses between @xmath28 2 tev and @xmath28 6 tev ; * elastic scattering events with @xmath0 values between @xmath28 2 gev@xmath3 and @xmath28 10 gev@xmath3 ; * forward charged particle multiplicity of inelastic @xmath1 events in the 3.1 @xmath33 6.5 region .",
    "the cross - sections for the above processes are large ( @xmath34 5 @xmath26b ) even if the totem acceptance is included , with the exception of high-@xmath0 elastic scattering . as an example",
    ", the bsw model  @xcite predicts an integrated elastic cross - section of @xmath28 60 nb for @xmath35 2 gev@xmath3 .",
    "this prediction , together with the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , imply that for an integrated luminosity of @xmath28 10 pb@xmath36 , totem would collect more than 10@xmath37 central and 10@xmath38 single diffractive events , together with @xmath28 10@xmath39 high-@xmath0 elastic events allowing a first test of the validity of different models as discussed in section  [ sec : elastic ] .",
    "the main background to diffractive events at low @xmath6 is either due to two overlapping @xmath1 collisions , like e.g. two overlapping single diffractive events for central diffraction , or one @xmath1 collision overlapping with beam induced proton background .",
    "hence the event purity will depend strongly on the average number of @xmath1 collisions per bunch crossing , which should be significantly smaller than one .",
    "the beam induced proton background not due to @xmath1 collisions in ip5 will be studied in bunch crossings where normal bunches meet `` empty '' bunches .",
    "the interest in the forward charged particle multiplicity is two - fold : first as a basic measurement of @xmath1 interaction at lhc energies and secondly as valuable input to the modeling of very high energy cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "the installation schedule of the totem detectors depends crucially on the cms installation schedule as well as on the lhc commissioning schedule .",
    "the full experiment is planned to be installed for the 2009 lhc running .",
    "the focus in the early lhc runs will be to understand the performance of the detectors and other vital parts like trigger and data acquisition , especially the approach of the rp detectors to the beam .",
    "the feasibility and time scale of the early physics programme will critically depend on the lhc performance in terms of luminosity and beam induced background in the totem detectors .",
    "it has been suggested that the central exclusive diffractive process @xmath40 where a `` + '' denotes a rapidity gap , could complement the standard methods of searching and studying new particles ( `` x '' ) at lhc , see e.g. ref .",
    "the main advantage is that the mass of the centrally produced particle @xmath41 can be reconstructed from the measured @xmath12 values of the outgoing protons as shown in eq .",
    "[ eqn_dpemass ] . provided that the two @xmath12 values can be determined with sufficient precision , peaks corresponding to particle resonances may appear in the reconstructed diffractive mass distribution independent of the particles decay modes .",
    "these measurements should be performed with high luminosity optics since the cross - sections are expected to be small .",
    "the work presented here aims to find the best detector locations at lhc in terms of @xmath12 acceptance and resolution for the proton measurement in central diffractive events .",
    "the diffractive proton acceptance of near beam detectors is determined by the ratio @xmath42 between horizontal dispersion and beam width . with larger @xmath43 the protons",
    "are deflected further away from the beam center , while the closest safe approach of a detector to the beam is given by a multiple  typically 10 to 15  of @xmath44 . by construction , the lhc region",
    "where @xmath43 and @xmath42 are maximized and hence the sensitivity to particle @xmath41 , is the momentum cleaning insertion in ip3 , where off - momentum beam protons are intercepted . the idea is to install proton detectors pairs with a lever arm of several tens of meters close to ip3 to detect diffractive protons in both beams just before they are absorbed by the momentum cleaning collimators .",
    "in addition to promising perspectives in diffraction , the placement of detectors in front of the collimators has advantages for accelerator diagnostics and protection .",
    "the technical aspects of placing proton detectors at ip3 is being worked out together with the lhc collimation group .",
    "the proton acceptance and resolution of an experiment with detectors at the totem rp220 location and at ip3 have been studied  @xcite by fully tracking the protons along the lhc ring with the mad - x  @xcite program using standard lhc high luminosity @xmath6 = 0.55 optics .",
    "the detector acceptance at ip3 for protons originating from diffractive scattering in ip5 is @xmath45 and @xmath46 for protons turning clockwise ( `` b1 '' ) and anticlockwise ( `` b2 '' ) in the lhc , respectively .",
    "this complements well the @xmath47 acceptance of rp220 for both beams .",
    "reduced since these protons have to pass through the aperture limiting betatron cleaning insertion at ip7 . in case of central diffraction  @xcite",
    ", this gives access to diffractive masses from 25gev to 2.8tev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ip3 ] ( left ) . a @xmath12 resolution @xmath48 10@xmath49 for protons detected at ip3",
    "is obtained in the study implying that the resolution will be limited by the beam energy spread of 1.1 @xmath50 10@xmath49 . combined with protons detected at rp220 ,",
    "this leads to a relative mass resolution ranging between 1 and 5 % for central diffractive events over the whole mass range as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ip3 ] ( right ) .",
    "the mass resolution depends on the ratio @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the @xmath12 value of the clockwise and anticlockwise turning proton , respectively .",
    "the protons detectors at ip3 would in fact see diffractive protons with similar acceptance from all lhc interaction points ( ip ) and could by measuring the difference of the proton arrival times determine at which ip the event occurred . this way the low mass central diffractive spectrum",
    "could be determined independently for each ip and be used as means of an inter - experimental luminosity calibration .",
    "the totem physics program aims at a deeper understanding of the proton structure by measuring the total and elastic @xmath1 cross sections and by studying a comprehensive menu of diffractive processes .",
    "totem will run under all lhc beam conditions to maximize the coverage of the studied processes .",
    "special high @xmath54 runs are needed for the total @xmath1 cross section measurement with the luminosity - independent method and for soft diffraction with large forward proton acceptances . at an early stage with non - optimal beams and an intermediate @xmath6",
    ", totem will measure @xmath20 with a 45 % precision . with improved understanding of the beams and @xmath32 m ,",
    "a precision on @xmath20 of 1% should be achievable .",
    "the measurement of elastic scattering in the range @xmath55 gev@xmath56 will allow to distinguish among a wide range of predictions according to current theoretical models .",
    "early low @xmath6 runs will provide first opportunities for measurements of soft diffraction for masses above @xmath28250 gev and @xmath282 tev in central and single diffractive events , respectively , as well as studies of the forward charged multiplicity in inelastic @xmath1 events .",
    "having proton detectors at ip3 would highly extend the diffractive mass acceptance of totem for high luminosity runs giving e.g. a continuous mass acceptance from 25 gev to 2.8 tev for central diffractive events .",
    "finally , hard diffraction as well as many forward physics subject will be studied in collaboration with cms taking advantage of the unprecedented rapidity coverage for charged and neutral particles ."
