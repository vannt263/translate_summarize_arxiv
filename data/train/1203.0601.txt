    "knowing the mass of active supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is of fundamental importance to understanding many physical processes associated with the black hole , as well as the assembly history of the smbh population across cosmic time . over the past several decades , reverberation mapping ( rm , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has proven to be a viable technique to measure ( broad - line ) agn bh mass by providing an estimate of the broad line region ( blr ) size @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , combined with the assumptions that the blr dynamics is dominated by the central bh mass and that the widths of the broad emission lines @xmath11 are related to the virial velocity of the blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the unknown geometry of the blr is absorbed in a constant virial coefficient @xmath12 , which is calibrated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to bring the products of @xmath13 into average agreement with those predicted from the local scaling relation between bh mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( the @xmath14 relation )",
    ".    an important result of rm studies is the discovery of a tight correlation between the blr size and the continuum luminosity of broad - line agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. , the @xmath15 relation , when plotted over a wide dynamical range in agn luminosity .",
    "this relation has led to the development of the so - called single - epoch virial bh mass estimators (  virial bh mass estimators  for short , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which one measures the continuum ( or line ) luminosity and broad line width from single - epoch spectroscopy to derive a virial product as the bh mass estimate , with coefficients calibrated from a sample of @xmath16 local agns with rm masses ( which are further tied to the predictions from the @xmath14 relation ) .",
    "various versions of single - epoch virial bh mass estimators have been developed since , based on different broad lines and advocating different recipes for measuring luminosities and line widths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this empirical method , albeit rooted in the rm technique , is much less expensive than rm , and hence has been applied in numerous studies to estimate quasar / agn bh masses , notably for large statistical samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the wide application of these virial bh mass estimators , there are many statistical and systematic uncertainties of these estimates .",
    "first and foremost , all single - epoch mass estimators are bootstrapped from a sample of only @xmath16 @xmath17 rm agns ( consisting of seyfert 1 galaxies and several pg quasars ) , which is known to be unrepresentative of their high - luminosity and high - redshift counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the statistics of rm agns need to be substantially improved to account for the diversity in blr properties .",
    "secondly , different versions of virial mass estimators have different systematics depending on the quality of the spectrum and the profile of the broad line , and there is currently no consensus as to which version is the best . nevertheless , there are some general considerations on various estimators :    @xmath18 _ which line to use : _ the commonly utilized pairs of line and luminosity in the restframe uv and optical are : h@xmath0  with @xmath19 or @xmath8 , h@xmath1  with @xmath8 ,  with @xmath7 , and civ  with @xmath6 ( or @xmath20 ) . since the balmer lines h@xmath0  and h@xmath1  are the most studied lines in reverberation mapping and the @xmath15 relation was originally measured for the balmer line blr radius and @xmath8(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is reasonable to argue that the virial mass estimator based on the balmer lines is the most reliable one .",
    "the width of the broad h@xmath0  is well correlated with that of the broad h@xmath1  and therefore it provides a good substitution in the absence of h@xmath1  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the  line has not been studied much in rm ( cf .",
    "* ) , and only in very few cases has a time - lag of  been measured with rm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but the width of  is shown to correlate with that of h@xmath1  in single - epoch spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that  may be used as a substitution for h@xmath1  in estimating virial bh masses .",
    "the civ  line is known to vary and time - lags have been measured for civ  in several objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the sample is too small to derive a reliable @xmath15 relation for civ . however , the high - ionization civ  line differs from low - ionization lines such as  and the balmer lines in many ways ( for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) , most notably it shows a prominent blueshift with respect to the low - ionization lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the civ  line is generally more asymmetric than  and the balmer lines , and the width of civ  is poorly correlated with those of  and h@xmath1(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the different properties of civ  suggest that civ  is probably more affected by a non - virial component such as arising from a radiatively - driven disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and would therefore be a biased virial mass estimator ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , since both the balmer lines and  move out of the optical bandpass at @xmath21 , it would be useful to improve the civ  estimator in order to measure bh masses at high redshift without the need for near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite used a large sample of @xmath22 sdss quasars to show that the difference between the civ  and  virial masses is correlated with the civ-  blueshift . on the other hand , @xcite used a sample of @xmath23 quasars with optical spectra covering civ  and near - ir spectra covering h@xmath1/h@xmath0  to show that the difference between civ  and balmer line virial masses is largely driven by their restframe uv - to - optical continuum luminosity ratio @xmath24 , suggesting that much of the dispersion in their virial mass difference is caused by the poor correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath6 rather than between their line widths . a larger sample is needed to test this result .",
    "@xmath18 _ line dispersion vs fwhm : _ the two common choices of line width are fwhm , and the second moment of the line ( line dispersion , @xmath25 ) . both fwhm and @xmath26 have advantages and disadvantages .",
    "fwhm is easier to measure , less susceptible to noise in the wings and line blending than @xmath26 , but is more sensitive to the treatment of the narrow line removal .",
    "arguably @xmath26 is a better surrogate for the virial velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the evidence is not very strong . since currently all the rm",
    "bh masses are computed using @xmath27 measured from the rms spectra @xcite , ideally one would like to use @xmath25 , albeit not measured from rms spectra , in single - epoch virial mass estimators . in practice , however , @xmath26 measured from single - epoch spectra depends on the quality of the spectra , line profile , and specific treatment of deblending , and could differ significantly from one observation / analysis to another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore in terms of readiness and repeatability , @xmath26 is less favorable than fwhm in single - epoch virial mass estimators .",
    "for these reasons , we will not utilize line dispersion in the current study .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the reliability of the uv virial mass estimators ( in particular civ ) compared with the h@xmath1  ( or h@xmath0 ) estimator with a carefully selected sample of quasars with good civ  to  coverage in optical sdss spectra and our own near - ir spectra covering h@xmath1  and h@xmath0 .",
    "our sample probes the high - luminosity regime ( @xmath28 , or @xmath29 ) of quasars , and thus such a study will provide confidence on estimating virial bh masses for the most luminous quasars ( such as @xmath30 quasars ) .",
    "our sample is substantially larger than earlier samples in similar studies , which enables us to draw more statistically significant conclusions .",
    "we are interested in examining empirical correlations between line widths and continuum luminosities of two different lines , and any dependence of their virial mass difference on specific quasar properties .",
    "we describe our sample and follow - up near - ir observations in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the procedure of measuring spectral properties is detailed in ",
    "[ sec : spec_measure ] and the results are presented in  [ sec : result ] .",
    "we discuss the results in  [ sec : dis ] and conclude in  [ sec : con ] . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath31cdm cosmology with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we select our targets from the sdss dr7 quasar catalog ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for follow - up near - ir spectroscopy with the following two criteria :    1 .",
    "redshift between @xmath35 and @xmath36 and avoiding redshift ranges where the h@xmath1  and h@xmath0  lines fall in the telluric absorption bands in the near - infrared ; 2 .   with good ( s / n @xmath37 ) sdss spectra covering civ through , and no broad absorption features or unusual continuum shapes .    these criteria by design selects luminous quasars ( bolometric luminosity @xmath38 ) as our targets , but the resulting sample still covers a range of spectral diversities such as the line width and velocity shift of each broad lines . in addition , host contamination is generally negligible for these objects , which greatly simplifies our model fits and interpretations .",
    "our targets have a similar color excess @xmath39 distribution ( where @xmath39 is the deviation of @xmath40 color from the median @xmath40 color at each redshift ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the underlying sdss quasars in this redshift range , but do not include any dust - reddened objects ( defined as @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath42 ( 5/49 ) of the targets are radio - loud ( @xmath43 , see * ? ? ?",
