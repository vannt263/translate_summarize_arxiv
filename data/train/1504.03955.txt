    "the standard model ( sm ) continues to be an extremely successful description of particle physics .",
    "the scalar resonance that was observed by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite , with mass 125.7@xmath6 gev @xcite is consistent with the sm higgs boson . nevertheless , there is still room for extensions of the scalar sector and despite the discovery of a sm - like higgs , the motivation for physics beyond the sm remains with the many unresolved puzzles that are not addressed by the sm .",
    "one of these puzzling facts is the existence of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , which is about five times more abundant than baryonic matter @xcite . up to now",
    "it is undetected by direct detection experiments and potential hints for dm signals in indirect detection experiments are not always conclusive due to astrophysical backgrounds , see e.g.  refs .",
    "a new unbroken symmetry seems to be of fundamental importance to explain the dm properties : it prevents the dm particle from decaying into sm particles , and thus stabilises it while also explaining the suppressed interactions with the sm particles . a simplistic `` bottom - up '' approach to the dm problem",
    "is given by the class of one - particle extensions of the sm .",
    "a more `` top - down '' approach often generates an entire `` dark sector '' , as is the case e.g.  for supersymmetry , extra dimensions and grand unified theories .    another puzzling fact that remains unresolved within",
    "the sm is the observation of regularities in the fermion sector of the sm .",
    "the mere existence of three fermionic generations can not be addressed or understood within the sm , let alone the particular pattern of the fermion masses or their mixings . a very peculiar feature is also found in the lepton sector , which shows at the same time tiny neutrino masses and large mixings between the generations .",
    "this is a pattern that is different from what is observed for the quark sector .",
    "an extension of the sm by one or more additional higgs doublets @xcite ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a review with the focus on two - higgs - doublet models ) can address both of the above mentioned shortcomings of the sm .",
    "one particularly intriguing possibility is to introduce the additional doublets as a multiplet of a flavour symmetry such as @xmath7 @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in such models with a flavour - symmetric extension of the scalar sector",
    "the higgs phenomenology leads to important direct constraints , while indirect constraints are given by fermion flavour violating processes or simply due to the requirement that the fermion masses and mixing are viable @xcite . in this type of @xmath7 model",
    "it is possible to account for an excess in @xmath8 events that was found by the cms collaboration @xcite , which is interpreted as lepton - flavour - violating decays of the sm - like higgs boson , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite    in this context , a very interesting `` top - down '' approach is given by the connection of the dm with the flavour sector where the dm candidate can be stabilised by the same symmetries that are introduced to explain patterns of leptonic mass and mixing , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for examples with @xmath7 symmetries . in flavour models with multiple scalar fields that have masses on the electroweak scale , i.e.  @xmath9(tev ) , there is the promise of rich collider phenomenology that can potentially be explored with the next lhc run , at 13 tev . in these models",
    "the dm candidate is typically part of a larger `` dark sector '' .    in this paper",
    "we study a multi - higgs and multi - component scalar dm model that entails a rich phenomenology , due in particular to the additional scalars having masses on the electroweak scale .",
