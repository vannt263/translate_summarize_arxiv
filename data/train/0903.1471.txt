    "black hole thermodynamics , cosmology and more generally unification , have all provided strong impetus for developing a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "there appears to be agreement on at least two features such a theory should have regardless of the details of the approach .",
    "these are background ( or metric ) independence and fundamental discreteness .",
    "it may be that other ideas such as holography arise as a consequence of the first two but this is far from clear at the present level of understanding .",
    "progress in quantum gravity has often been limited to models where a complete quantization can be performed , such as the work on mini - superspace cosmology in the early seventies @xcite , and its later incarnations in the hartle - hawking approach @xcite and loop quantum cosmology@xcite .",
    "these are all quantum mechanical systems arrived at by the assumption of spatial homogeneity of spacetime .",
    "the extent to which such models can reveal insights into quantum gravity is not clear @xcite although recent developments on singularity avoidance may be one such feature .",
    "more generally the hope is that such smaller systems will ultimately become absorbed in a full theory of quantum gravity in the same way that the bohr atom has in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "going beyond mini - superspace models significantly enlarges the problem to a true field theory of a constrained system .",
    "the first step in this direction is to a two - dimensional field theory , where the metric and matter variables depend on time and one spatial coordinate .",
    "there are a few models of interest in this category , namely the gowdy cosmology , cylindrical gravitational waves and the asymptotically flat gravity - scalar field theory .",
    "the quantum theory of the first two models have been studied in the simplified approximation of one local degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "these are vacuum models so they are less interesting physically than the last one , which has the potential to reveal much about gravitational collapse and black hole formation in quantum gravity @xcite . furthermore this model is the natural next step beyond just the quantum mechanics of the schwarzschild black hole , on which much has been written @xcite .",
    "this system has a true hamiltonian that forms a part of its asymptotic poincar symmetries .",
    "the model provides the setting for two important physical scenarios : numerical studies of gravitational collapse @xcite and the so - called information loss paradox , whose origin involves an assumption on the large scale structure of an evaporating black hole based on semiclassical physics @xcite .",
    "it is concerned with a collapsing low - entropy ( or even pure - state ) matter that forms a black hole , which subsequently evaporates within a finite time , resulting in a highly - entropic hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "if the correlations between the inside and outside of the black hole are not restored during the evaporation process , then the corresponding increase in entropy is interpreted as a lost  information \" .",
    "various arguments have been advanced to justify or dismiss this phenomenon @xcite , as well as possible consequences of either option @xcite .",
    "there is the possibility that the existence of a quantum theory of gravity automatically removes the information loss  paradox \" , since a complete quantization of the true hamiltonian would result in the unitary evolution of the combined matter - gravity system @xcite , while the entropy flow between subsystems can be interpreted with the help of quantum information theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we build on recent developments @xcite aimed at obtaining a compete quantum theory of the asymptotically flat gravity - scalar field theory in spherical symmetry .",
    "this earlier work used a gauge appropriate for painleve - gullstrand coordinates ( because of their regularity at the horizon ) , and provided a construction of the hamiltonian and null expansion operators .",
    "not addressed in these works are the problems of finding physical states and addressing their dynamics .",
    "this is what we study in this paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first review the model and its quantization .",
    "we then give a prescription for constructing semiclassical physical states that are peaked on classical data , and give a new form of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "( an earlier version of this operator utilized a dirac - like trick to write a square root operator . ) using these we show that physical states exhibit matter - gravity entanglement .",
    "we argue that this may be a robust model independent feature of non - locality in quantum gravity",
    "our starting point is the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) hamiltonian formulation for general relativity .",
    "the phase space of the model is defined by prescribing a form of the gravitational phase space variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , together with fall - off conditions for these variables , and for the lapse and shift functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the adm 3 + 1 action for general relativity minimally coupled to a massless scalar field is s = d^3x dt .",

    "below ( sec iia ) we outline the structure that results from imposition of spherical symmetry and use of the flat - slice partial gauge - fixing .",
    "( this is a summary of the work in @xcite . )",
    "the reason for utilizing this gauge is that the horizon is not located at a coordinate singularity . in sec iib",
    "we present a family of initial data that will illustrate , in a later section , a construction of semiclassical physical states of the model .",
    "the reduction to spherical symmetry utilizes an auxiliary flat euclidean metric @xmath6 and unit radial normal @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the parametrization of the reduced phase space we use is given by the matrices q_ab & = & ( r , t)^2  s_a s_b +  ( e_ab - s_a s_b ) , + ^ab & = &  s^a s^b + ( e^ab - s^a s^b ) , [ reduc ] as a line element the spatial metric is therefore ds^2 = ^2(r , t ) dr^2 + r(r , t)^2 d^2 , where the solid angle @xmath9 arises from the second term in these expressions .    the painleve - gullstrand ( pg ) coordinates are those where equal coordinate time slices are spatially flat @xcite .",
    "however it is sufficient to use the partial gauge fixing @xmath10 to obtain the feature of non - singular coordinates at the horizon , which is the feature of pg coordinates we desire .",
    "this is what is summarized in the remaining part of this section .    substituting ( [ reduc ] ) into the adm @xmath11 action with minimally coupled scalar field leads to the reduced action s_r & = & dtdr ( p_r + p",

    "it is therefore important to ensure that the reduced action in functionally differentiable with a consistent set of fall - off conditions on the phase space variables , and on the lapse and shift functions .",
    "this analysis has been carefully done by one of the authors in ref .",

    "the leading order terms are solutions of the constraints , so there is no logarithmic divergence of the action at this order .",
    "the mass formula is the surface term in eqn .",
    "( [ red - action ] ) ; the mass parameter arises in this integral through the momentum @xmath16 .",
    "it is readily verified that if the scalar field is set to zero the schwarzschild solution results @xcite .",
    "we next impose the gauge choice @xmath10 , which corresponds to a step toward flat slice coordinates . with this condition imposed ,",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is solved ( strongly ) for the conjugate momentum @xmath16 as a function of the phase space variables .",
    "this gives p_= p_rr + , [ pl ] where x = 16r^2 ( 2rr  - 1 + r^2 ) + 16r^2 h _ , and h_= +  ^2 .",
    "this effectively eliminates the conjugate pair @xmath17 in favour of the remaining phase space variables . we must however obtain the consequence of this for the lapse and shift functions in the standard way : the evolution equation for @xmath18 @xcite and the requirement that the gauge @xmath10 be preserved under evolution leads to the equation n = - .",
    "[ lapse ] we note that this relation does not lead to any restriction on the phase space variables , since it is merely a relation between the lapse @xmath2 and and the shift @xmath19 , neither of which is absolutely fixed at this stage .",
    "we also note that on the classical space of solutions , the argument of the square root is positive ; in quantum theory , it is in principle possible that fluctuations may make this negative .",
    "this however is an issue that is present in general in the adm variable approach to quantum gravity because the hamiltonian constraint contains a factor of @xmath20 , which may fluctuate such that the argument is negative .",
    "the issue hinges on how the corresponding operator is defined .",
    "we discuss this below where we set up the dirac quantization problem .",
    "the gauge @xmath10 reduced the radial diffeomorphism constraint to c_r = -p_ + p_r r + p_ 0 , with @xmath16 given by ( [ pl ] ) above .",

    "finally we note that we have not yet fully fixed the gauge to the flat slice case since we have not imposed the condition @xmath22 .",
    "we prefer to retain @xmath23 as a dynamical variable for developing the quantum theory , since full gauge fixing leads to a reduced hamiltonian for the scalar field degrees of freedom that is non - local @xcite , and so poses a problem for quantization .",
    "finding classical initial data sets is necessary both in numerical calculations and for the construction of semi - classical physical states . as one of our aims in this paper is to present a concrete realization of the latter , it is useful to see what form such data takes before we proceed to a construction of such states .",

    "we shall see , after describing the quantum theory , that semiclassical states corresponding to data with trapped surfaces such as this , describe a quantum black hole state .",

    "however , from the constraint @xmath85 we see that classically on the constraint surface we have p_(r ) = ^r_0 dr ( p_ + p_rr ) .",
    "this suggests that for physical states it is possible to compute the energy by finding an operator analog of the r.h.s . of this equation .",
    "since the quantization we are using utilizes a radial lattice we can write the integral as a discrete sum over the lattice points @xmath59 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to suggest the definition _",
    "k = l_p_i=1^k    this operator is useful with the type of semiclassical states we define below in sec .",
    "v. in such states a computation of the expectation value @xmath86 is possible .",
    "the energy of the quantum spacetime would be this expression evaluated at the farthest lattice point , ie .",
    "we would take the limit @xmath87 after computing the expectation value .",
    "this would a possible analog of the classical definition where the energy e= _ r  p_(r)n^r(r ) .",
    "we note that the asymptotic falloff of @xmath19 is determined by the classical requirement of functional differentiability @xcite , and this behavior of @xmath19 carries over to the quantum theory , since @xmath19 is not a phase space variable .",
    "initial states of the gravity - matter system should satisfy the quantum constraint |=0 , which is supplemented by the requirement that @xmath88 belong to the positive part of the spectrum of @xmath89 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether any of the operator ordering choices allows for this to be satisfied on a sufficiently large set of states , or if another realization of the constraint is necessary to accomplish this .",
    "nevertheless , it is already possible to make a few remarks .",
    "we give here two observations , on gravity - matter entanglement and on the information loss problem .",
    "firstly , in the case of pure gravity @xmath90 , the ordering that puts the @xmath73 operator to the right results in the operator form of the constraint ( [ norootdiff ] ) gives    with no excitations , ie .",
    "all @xmath91 .",
    "this may be viewed as a `` degenerate metric vacuum '' because it is the eigenstate of the field operator @xmath92 with zero eigenvalue at all points @xmath59 .    secondly , the presence of the matter - gravity terms in the constraint turns it into entangling operator ( see eg .",
    "this can be seen by considering the constraint in the form of eq .",
    "( [ norootdiff ] ) .",
    "it splits cleanly into gravity part , and a separate gravity ",
    "matter interaction = _ g_m+_^g_^m_. [ constrsplit ]",
    "the latter term contains monomials that involve gravity and matter operators .",
    "consider their action on the basis states of the kinematical hilbert space @xmath93 .",
    "the term @xmath94 serves as an example : _ ^k _",
    "r^k |a|b(|a_1 a_k - a_n-|a_1 a_k - a_n)(|b_1b_k - b_m-|b_1b_k+b_m ) , which is a direct product of entangled gravity and matter modes .",
    "however , adding different terms in the constraint results in a superposition of such direct product states , and the constraint operator can not be written as @xmath95 .",
    "some states of the form @xmath96 may be transformed into a direct product form , ( |_g|_m)=|_g|_m , provided that they satisfy an additional constraint _ ^g_^m_(|_g|_m)|_g|_m . as a result ,",
    "even if such states exist , they form a lower - dimensional set then the set of all physical states , and by themselves do not form a vector space : their linear combinations are by definition entangled .",
    "since we expect the semiclassical states to be suitably defined coherent states , we see that these configurations are geometry - matter entangled .",
    "this result of course holds regardless of weather a state corresponds to a classical black hole .",
    "the entanglement prevents the direct product gravity@xmath97matter decomposition of a generic physical state .",
    "semiclassical states that are peaked at a given classical configurations may be defined for a field theory just as for a quantum mechanical systems . for a constrained system such as the one we are considering",
    ", it is possible to obtain states that are peaked on classical constraint free data .",
    "these may be viewed as approximate physical states in a precise sense .    for a constraint @xmath98 in a field theory ,",
    "the steps we propose are as follows : ( i ) begin with an explicit classical solution of the constraints , such as that given in sec .",
    "ii.b , ( ii ) select sampling points @xmath57 ( or a lattice ) , and the corresponding solution values @xmath99 , @xmath100 etc . , ( iii ) construct a gaussian state peaked at each field value @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and",
    "finally ( iv ) take the product of the gaussians , one at each point @xmath57 to give the field theory semiclassical state .",
    "this is what we describe in detail below .",
    "reasonable requirements for an approximate semiclassical state are that ( r_k = 0 ,   ( r_k)^2 = 0 , for each sample point @xmath59 . we give here a generalization of the semiclassical states for friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology given in @xcite , and show how this can be utilized for the present model .",
    "let us consider first a single lattice point @xmath59 and the basis states at this point defined by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 in an integer .",
    "let us consider the state at @xmath59 defined by the linear combination |p_r^0,r^0^t,_r_k = _",
    "m=-^e^-(m)^2 e^mr^0 e^imp_r^0 |m_r_k .",
    "[ semiclass ] this is a gaussian state of width @xmath103 ( measured in planck units ) , where the ( real ) parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the field values corresponding to a classical configuration at the point @xmath59 .",
    "the width @xmath103 is a measure of how strongly peaked the state is on a given classical configuration , ie .",
    "@xmath106 means that fluctuations around @xmath107 are small .",
    "we shall see in the following that this state has a number of desirable properties , and because of this , it allows a construction of approximate physical states of the theory we are considering .",
    "( there may be other non - gaussian states with such properties but our purpose here is to point out that this one is useful . )",
    "the normalization condition for the state gives an expression for the constant @xmath108 .",
    "it is the convergent sum c^2=_m=-^e^-t^2m^2 e^2r^0 m. [ norm ] calculation with this state gives the expectation value @xcite _ = e^ip_r^0(r_k)e^-t^2/4  k(,t , r^0 ) .",

    "this formula has the limits _",
    "r^&= & ( p_r^0(r_k))/ , + _ 0  _ r^&= & p_r^0(r_k ) .",
    "the first shows that the semiclassical state in field space is peaked at the corresponding phase space value .",
    "the second shows that the field continuum limit of the momentum expectation value has the appropriate peaked value in this state , even though only field translation operators exist in the representation we are using .",
    "these semiclassical states defined at each point @xmath57 can now be used to give a state for the entire radial lattice given any classical field configuration @xmath109 by taking a product of the point states over the lattice @xmath110 , ie .",
    "|r(r),p(r)^t , : = _ k=1^n    of fields is the product ||r(r),p(r)^t ,   |(r),p_(r)^t , .",
    "[ scphys ] it is not difficult to configure entangled products of semiclassical states , given two distinct classical solutions of the constraints .    given that the expectation values in these states give the classical peaking values it follows that the states peaked on classical constraint free data , such as those constructed in section ii , satisfy the expectation value | | = 0 + o(t^ ) , where @xmath111 .",
    "we note also that the construction we have given is quite specific , and there is control on the fluctuation @xmath112 , which is itself a function of the width @xmath103 of the point gaussian states . its value can be tuned to reduce the fluctuations .",
    "it is in this sense that these states are approximately physical for sharply peaked states @xmath113 .",
    "one can now compute quantities such as the expectation value of the energy in such states , which is tedious put possible .",
    "one approach for obtaining quantum gravity corrections is to use semiclassical states to derive `` effective constraints . ''",
    "these can then be used to obtain modified equations of motion in the usual way .",
    "this approach is qualitatively related to the ideas underlying ehrenfest s theorem in quantum mechanics .",
    "one computes expectation values of the constraints in states peaked on classical configurations that are not solutions of the initial value constraints to obtain , p _ , r , p_r | | , p _ , r , p_r = c^classical ( , p _ , r , p_r ) + o(t^ ) .",
    "it is understood here that the classical term on the right hand side is a function of the phase space configuration on which the states are peaked .",
    "the corrections are functions of the state s width @xmath103 in planck units .",
    "this approach has been used for homogeneous isotropic cosmology @xcite , but requires careful scrutiny in the field theory case here .",
    "one has to check that the poisson algebra of the effective constraints closes with the state width corrections included , since these corrections are functions of the phase space peaking values of the semiclassical state .",
    "one of the goals of the program presented here is to obtain consistent effective equations of motion starting from semiclassical states .",
    "the paper contains a number of developments beyond earlier works on the spherically symmetric gravity - scalar model : ( i ) a construction of semiclassical states for the quantum theory of gravity coupled to a minimally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "these states may be utilized for constructing semiclassical effective constraints , which may then be used for classical numerical evolution . if used in conjunction with constraint free data , such as that given in sec .",
    "ii.b , this construction gives the first known examples of _ physical _ semiclassical states .",
    "( ii ) an alternative construction of the hamiltonian operator in a fixed time gauge which can serve as a starting point for monte carlo simulations of the quantum theory .",
    "since this model is a two - dimensional system that is effectively written as a lattice theory , this method has the potential to reveal interesting non - perturbative quantum phenomena such as phase transitions .",
    "this is at present being studied .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian also reveals that matter - gravity entanglement is an inherent feature of evolution in quantum gravity ; the action of the hamiltonian on a product state gives an entangled state after a single evolution step . in the full quantum problem",
    "the constraint operator forces a bipartite entanglement ( with the two subsystems being the kinematical hilbert spaces of matter and gravity degrees of freedom , respectively ) already on the initial physical states .",
    "it is tempting to summarize this observation by modifying wheeler s one line description of general relativity @xcite : quantum gravity tells geometry and matter how to entangle .",
    "the degree of entanglement may be computed in the usual way by tracing a density matrix over either matter of geometry degrees of freedom .",
    "if a state describes a black hole there is a second entropy that may be calculated , namely that obtained by tracing the ( pure ) density matrix over both geometry and matter degrees of freedom inside a trapped region .",
    "this of course would be different from the usual entanglement entropy where the trace in the interior applies only to the matter degrees of freedom",
    ".    it will be apparent to the reader that the extraction of physical results from this formalism requires further work .",
    "this could proceed along two distinct avenues .",
    "the first is the derivation of semiclassical effective equations where one would compute expectation values of the constraint operators in suitable states to obtain `` effective '' constraints .",
    "these would then be used as the basis of a quantum gravity corrected classical dynamics which could be integrated using numerical methods . among other things it would be useful to see what becomes of the critical scaling observed at the onset of black hole formation , especially the critical solution .",
    "initial results using this approach @xcite indicate that black holes form with a gap , but so far there are no results on the critical solution itself ; with expected singularity avoidance , it is likely that this is replaced by a critical and unstable bound state  a finely tuned boson star .",
    "the second approach to studying dynamics could utilize monte carlo methods .",
    "the quantum model as formulated here is like a statistical mechanical system , with the difference that it is still a constrained theory .",
    "one can imagine sampling from phase space such that the samples are solutions of the constraints up to some threshold , along with the usual monte carlo selection criteria .",
    "such an approach would have the potential to yield fundamental information concerning phase transitions .",
