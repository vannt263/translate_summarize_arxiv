    "in 1957 g.a .  askaryan pointed out that ionisation and cavitation along a track of an ionising particle through a liquid leads to hydrodynamic radiation @xcite . in the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s ,",
    "theoretical and experimental studies have been performed on the hydrodynamic radiation of beams and particles traversing dense media @xcite .",
    "the interest in characterising the properties of the acoustic radiation was , among other reasons , lead by the idea that the effect can be utilised to detect ultra - high energy ( @xmath1 ) cosmic , i.e.  astrophysical neutrinos , in dense media like water , ice and salt .",
    "in the 1970s this idea was discussed within the dumand optical neutrino detector project @xcite and has been studied in connection with cherenkov neutrino detector projects since .",
    "the detection of such neutrinos is considerably more challenging than the search for high - energy neutrinos ( @xmath2 ) as currently pursued by under - ice and under - water cherenkov neutrino telescopes  @xcite . due to",
    "the low expected fluxes , detector sizes exceeding 100km@xmath3 are needed @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the acoustic method allow for sparsely instrumented arrays with @xmath4100 sensors / km@xmath3 .    to study the feasibility of a detection method based on acoustic signals it is necessary to understand the properties of the sound generation by comparing measurements and simulations based on theoretical models .",
    "according to the so - called thermo - acoustic model @xcite , the energy deposition of particles traversing liquids leads to a local heating of the medium which can be regarded as instantaneous with respect to the hydrodynamic time scales .",
    "due to the temperature change the medium expands or contracts according to its bulk volume expansion coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "the accelerated motion of the heated medium generates an ultrasonic pulse whose temporal signature is bipolar and which propagates in the volume .",
    "coherent superposition of the elementary sound waves , produced over the cylindrical volume of the energy deposition , leads to a propagation within a flat disk - like volume in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the particle shower .    in this study ,",
    "the hydrodynamic signal generation by two types of beams , interacting with a water target , was investigated : pulsed protons and a pulsed laser , mimicking the formation of a hadronic cascade from a neutrino interaction under laboratory conditions .",
    "with respect to the aforementioned experimental studies of the thermo - acoustic model , the work presented here can make use of previously unavailable advanced tools such as geant4  @xcite for the simulation of proton - induced hadronic showers in water .",
    "good agreement was found in the comparison of the measured signal properties with the simulation results , providing confidence to apply similar simulation methods in the context of acoustic detection of ultra - high energy neutrinos . a puzzling feature observed in previous studies ",
    "a non - vanishing signal amplitude at a temperature of 4@xmath6c , where for water at its highest density no thermo - acoustic signal should be present  was investigated in detail .",
    "such a residual signal was also observed for the proton beam experiment described in this article , but not for the laser beam , indicating that the formation of this signal is related to the charge or the mass of the protons .",
    "in the following , the thermo - acoustic model @xcite is derived from basic assumptions , using a hydrodynamic approach .",
    "basis is the momentum conservation , i.e. , the euler equation @xmath7 for mass density @xmath8 , velocity vector field of the medium @xmath9   and momentum - density tensor @xmath10 including the pressure @xmath11  @xcite . equation ( [ eq_euler ] ) can be derived from momentum conservation . in the derivation , energy dissipation resulting from processes such as internal friction or heat transfer are neglected .",

    "this splitting can be reflected by the momentum density tensor , rewriting it as @xmath17 in local equilibrium the changes in mass density are given by @xmath18 with the bulk volume expansion coefficient @xmath19 , the energy deposition @xmath20 , the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath21 in the medium and the specific heat @xmath22 .    in the acoustic regime , where @xmath23 , the momentum density tensor can be expressed as @xmath24 ( using eqs.([eq_densitytensor ] ) and ( [ eq_density_change ] ) ) , where we assume an adiabatic density change with pressure . the non - linear kinetic term @xmath25 entering @xmath26 according to eq .",

    "although in non - equilibirum we apply eq .",
    "( [ eq_density_change ] ) with the energy deposition density @xmath34 of the beam .",
    "then , with the additional energy - momentum tensor due to the beam @xmath35 the wave equation ( [ eq_wave_base ] ) reads @xmath36 the general solution for the wave equation can be written using a green function approach as @xmath37 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the components of the unit vector @xmath38 and the retarded time @xmath39 .",
    "for the last conversion , partial integration and the total derivative @xmath40 have been used repeatedly . note that @xmath41 for @xmath42 , so that the integration is carried out over the volume of the energy deposition region @xmath15 .",
    "assuming an energy deposition without momentum transfer to the medium , the kinetic term in the _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) can be neglected ( @xmath43 ) yielding @xmath44 for a thermo - acoustic wave generated solely by heating of the medium .",

    "( [ eq_pressure ] ) for the case of an instantaneous energy deposition .    equation  ( [ eq_pressure ] ) is equivalent to the results obtained from the approaches presented in @xcite .",
    "the derivation pursued above , however , uses a different approach starting with the euler equation and an anisotropic energy - momentum tensor , yielding a more general expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pressure - approx ] ) . only if assuming an isotropic energy deposition one arrives at the expression for the pressure deviation @xmath45 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq_pressure ] ) .",
    "note that the validation of the last assumption @xmath43 being a good approximation would require a detailed knowledge of the momentum transfer from the beam to the medium .",

    "( [ eq_pressure ] ) which may become the dominant contribution to wave generation if @xmath48 close to 4.0@xmath49c .",
    "however , for @xmath43 the pressure field resulting from a beam interaction in a medium is determined by the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy deposition density @xmath50 alone .",
    "the amplitude of the resulting acoustic wave is governed by the thermodynamic properties @xmath21 , @xmath51 and @xmath5 , the latter three depending primarily on the temperature of the medium .",
    "a controlled variation of these parameters in the conducted laboratory experiments and a study of the resulting pressure signals therefore allows for a precise test of the thermo - acoustic model .",
    "simulations based on the thermo - acoustic model , as performed to interpret the results of the experiments described in the next section , will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_simulation ] .",
    "note that the energy deposition density @xmath50 and its temporal evolution for the proton and laser beam interactions discussed in this paper are quite different from those expected for the interaction of ultra - high energy neutrinos .",
    "however , if a simulation starting from basic principles allows for a good reproduction of the experimental results , it is reasonable to assume that these simulation methods are transferable to neutrino interactions , as they are governed by the same underlying physical processes .",
    "the experiments presented in this paper were performed with a pulsed infrared nd : yag laser facility ( @xmath52 ) located at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the pulsed @xmath53 proton beam of the `` gustaf werner cyclotron '' at the `` theodor svedberg laboratory '' in uppsala , sweden .",
    "the beam properties allow for a compact experimental setup . in both cases ,",
    "the beams were dumped into a dedicated @xmath54 water tank , where the acoustic field was measured with several position - adjustable acoustic sensors ( see fig .",

    "the sensors ( also called hydrophones ) could be positioned within the tank with absolute uncertainties below 1 cm .",
    "the temperature of the water could be varied between @xmath55 and @xmath56 with a precision of @xmath57 .",
    "the temperature was brought to a particular value by first cooling the water with ice ; subsequently the whole water volume was heated to the desired temperature in a controlled , gradual procedure .",
    "once the water temperature had been established , at least 10min remained for measurements until the water volume heated up by @xmath57 through heat transfer from the environment .",
    "this time span was sufficient for all measurements conducted at water temperatures below the ambient temperature .",
    "the explored range of spill energies for the proton beam was from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the beam diameter was approximately @xmath60 and the spill time @xmath61 . for @xmath62 protons , the energy deposition in the water along the beam axis ( @xmath63-axis , beam entry into the water at @xmath64 ) is relatively uniform up to @xmath65 ending in the prominent bragg - peak at @xmath66 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) . to adjust the spill energy ,",
    "the number of protons per bunch was varied .",
    "the total charge of a bunch was calibrated with two independent methods ( faraday cups and scintillation counters ) , leading to an uncertainty on the order of 15% , with some higher values for low spill energies . to obtain the beam intensity and profile for the proton interactions in the water tank , the distance of about 1.2 m that the beam was travelling from the exit of the beam pipe through air and its entering into the water tank were included in the geant4 simulation .    for the laser experiment , the pulse energy was adjusted between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and calibrated using a commercial power meter .",
    "the beam had a diameter of approximately @xmath69 mm and the pulse length was fixed at @xmath70 . for the infrared light used , the laser energy density deposited along the beam axis has an exponential decrease with an absorption length of @xmath71 ( see fig .  [ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) .",
    "for both beam types the lateral energy deposition profile was gaussian ( the aforementioned beam diameters are the @xmath72 s of the profiles ) .",
    "the two experiments allow to explore different spatial and temporal distributions of the energy deposition as well as two different mechanisms of energy transfer into the medium . for both beams",
    ", energy is deposited via excitation , in addition the medium is ionised in the case of the proton beam .     , width=294 ]    for the signal recording , sensors based on the piezo - electric effect @xcite were used .",
    "a full characterisation of these sensors had been performed prior to the experiments .",
    "they are linear in amplitude response , the frequency response is flat starting from a few khz up to the main resonance at @xmath73 with a sensitivity of @xmath74 ( @xmath40.02v / pa ) .",
    "the main resonance is more sensitive by @xmath45@xmath75 and sensitivity drops rapidly at higher frequencies ; at 90khz , the sensitivity has dropped by 20db .",
    "the absolute uncertainty in the determination of the sensitivity is at a level of 2db in the frequency range of interest . above 90khz",
    "the uncertainty exceeds 5db . to calculate the response of the sensors to an external pressure pulse",
    "a parametrised fit of an equivalent circuit model as described in @xcite was used .",
    "the sensitivity dependence on temperature was measured and the relative decrease was found to be less than @xmath76 ( or about 0.13db ) per @xmath77 .    for every set of fixed experimental parameters ( temperature , energy , sensor position , etc . )",
    "the signals of 1000 beam pulses were recorded with a digital oscilloscope at a sampling rate in excess of @xmath78 .",
    "this rate is sufficient for the signals with spectral components up to 100khz , where the sensitivity of the sensors is negligibly small .",
    "these individual pulses were averaged to reduce background and environmental noise in the analysis , thereby obtaining a very high statistical precision .",
    "figure [ fig_signals ] shows typical signals measured in the proton and the laser experiment , respectively , using the same sensors and experimental setup .",
    "the general shapes of the two signals differ : a typical signal for the proton beam shows a bipolar signature , the one for the laser deviates from such a generic form .",
    "the laser signal has high frequency components up to several mhz due to the high energy deposition density at the point of beam entry and the almost instantaneous energy deposition compared to the @xmath79s pulse of the proton beam ; therefore the resonance of the sensor is excited causing a ringing in the measured signal .",
    "the spatial distribution of the energy density @xmath50 deposited by the laser leads to the two separate signals : the first originates in the beam area at the same @xmath63-region as the sensor placement ( _ ` direct signal ' _ ) , the second from the beam entry , a point of discontinuity where most of the energy is deposed ( _ ` beam entry signal ' _ ) .",
    "the signal of the proton beam is deteriorated with respect to an ideal bipolar signal .",
    "three main contributions to this distortion can be discerned : the recorded signal starts before the expected onset of the acoustic signal ( 55.2@xmath79s for the given position , see fig .",
    "[ fig_signals ] , given by the sonic path length ) ; reflections of the acoustic wave on the beam entry window overlay the original wave starting in the first rare - faction peak ; and finally there are frequency components of the signal exciting a resonant response of the sensor , slightly changing the signal shape and causing ringing . the first point was studied and found to be consistent with an electric charge effect in the sensors caused by the proton beam .",
    "its starting time was always coincident with the beam pulse entry into the water , even for sensor distances of up to 1 m , hinting at an electromagnetic origin of the distorting signal .",
    "the shape of this non - acoustic signal is consistent with the integrated time - profile of the beam pulse with a subsequent exponential decay .",
    "this deformation of the main signal is considered a systematic uncertainty on the signal properties and treated as such in the analysis . for the most part",
    ", its shape was fitted and subtracted from the signal .    in order to minimise the impact of the signal deformation caused by",

    "a comparison of these two publications shows that a different behaviour near the temperature of @xmath123c was observed for the two types of beams .",

    "uncertainties due to the simulations of hadronic cascades and cascade - to - cascade variations are large @xcite , dominating the challenge to detect and identify sound signals resulting from neutrino interactions .",
    "it can hence be concluded that the current level of precision in modelling sound signals in the context of the thermo - acoustic model is fully sufficient for the understanding of acoustic neutrino signatures .",
    "the latter is necessary to improve the selection efficiency and background rejection for neutrino detection algorithms in potential future acoustic neutrino detectors .",
    "several experiments have been conducted  @xcite to understand the acoustic background at the sites of potential future large - scale acoustic neutrino telescopes in sea water , fresh water and ice .",
    "the combination of simulation efforts , laboratory measurements and studies with in - situ test arrays will allow for a conclusion of the feasibility of acoustic neutrino detection .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sound generation mechanism of intense pulsed beams is well described by the thermo - acoustic model . in",
    "almost all aspects investigated , the signal properties are consistent with the model .",
    "the biggest uncertainties of the experiments are on the 10@xmath0 level .",
    "one discrepancy is the non - vanishing signal at 4@xmath49c for the proton beam experiment , which can be described with an additional non - temperature dependent signal with a @xmath132 contribution to the amplitude at 15@xmath49c .",
    "the model allows for calculations of the characteristics of sound pulses generated in the interaction of high energy particles in water with the input of the energy deposition of the resulting cascade . a possible application of this technique would be the detection of neutrinos with energies @xmath142",
