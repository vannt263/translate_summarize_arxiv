    "the calculation of real - time quantum dynamics for large molecular systems is a longstanding problem in chemical physics . of particular interest",
    "is the case of a small subsystem embedded in a surrounding thermal bath , which forms the basis for the investigation of condensed phase energy and electron transfer as well as spin and charge transport in nanoscale devices@xcite . in such situations ,",
    "one is typically interested in the calculation of the system s _ reduced _ dynamics , averaged over the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "due to the importance of these problems and the absence of a general solution , a variety of methods have been developed which vary as to the regimes in which they are accurate and their applicability to large systems .",
    "many of these approaches rely on either averaging over semi - classical trajectories of bath degrees of freedom or propagating the system s reduced density matrix ( rdm ) directly without explicit treatment of the bath , for example by master equations or path integral techniques .",
    "trajectory based methods include the mean - field ehrenfest@xcite , surface - hopping@xcite , semi - classical initial value representation@xcite , linearization@xcite , and classical mapping@xcite approaches .",
    "these offer the appeal of a transparent link to the classical limit and simple application to complex condensed phase systems and to slow baths .",
    "however , these methods typically fail in regimes with strong system - bath coupling or high - frequency baths where quantum effects are known to be important .",
    "techniques based on direct propagation of the reduced density matrix include the markovian and non - markovian bloch - redfield equations@xcite and the noninteracting blip approximation@xcite which serves as a time - dependent generalization of frster theory@xcite .",
    "to make such approaches manageable , perturbation theory in the system - bath coupling ( bloch - redfield ) and in the non - adiabatic coupling ( niba , frster ) are typically carried out only to second - order and hence performance degrades when these terms become large .",
    "in addition , path integral approaches , such as quantum monte carlo @xcite and the quasi - adiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi)@xcite have also been developed to propagate the rdm . while these approaches can be made numerically exact , they are frequently difficult to converge in practice when the system - bath coupling is strong or the bath is slow . furthermore , many variants scale poorly with the number of system states , drastically limiting the size of treatable systems .",
    "hence when the bath dynamics are `` fast '' compared to those of the system ( the so - called _ non - adiabatic _ regime ) , both perturbative quantum master equations and numerically exact path integral approaches are typically accurate since the correlation time of the bath is short , rendering non - markovian memory effects less significant .",
    "when the bath dynamics are `` slow '' compared to those of the system ( the _ adiabatic _ regime ) , these methods fail but it becomes reasonable to treat the bath degrees of freedom classically and hence trajectory - based schemes generally yield accurate results . given this complementarity , it would clearly be desirable to develop a scheme which can accurately treat both regimes by naturally tuning between the above approaches in a consistent manner .",
    "in addition , such an approach might effectively treat intermediate regimes where no obvious time - scale separation exists and hence neither rdm nor trajectory - based approaches are accurate .",
    "the `` dynamical hybrid '' scheme of wang , thoss and miller @xcite offers such an approach in which bath degrees of freedom are partitioned into `` core '' modes to be treated with quantum mechanics and `` reservoir '' modes to be treated with classical mechanics . in this scheme , the wavefunction - based multi - configurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh)@xcite method is used for the system and core while a mean - field ehrenfest treatment is applied to the reservoir .",
    "when applied to the spin - boson problem , this dynamical hybrid scheme frequently converges to the exact result with only a small percentage of modes included in the core .",
    "however , to achieve convergence in the presence of fast baths , up to 80% of the bath modes need to be included in the core .",
    "due to the high cost of treating modes using mctdh , this severely reduces the efficiency of the dynamical hybrid approach and hence limits the ease with which it can be applied to larger systems .    in this work",
    ", we present a methodology which avoids the use of wavefunctions , replacing them with a single reduced density matrix averaged over the quantum core modes .",
    "the reservoir modes exert a classical time - dependent driving force on this system rdm , which in turn drives the classical modes via a back - reaction force .",
    "this reduced density matrix hybrid formalism ( rdm - hybrid ) allows one to use an appropriately chosen partitioning of the bath into core and reservoir modes such that the system rdm can be propagated either by an exact reduced dynamics algorithm _ with a decreased cost _ or by an inexpensive approximate master equation _ with improved accuracy_. in other words , by using physical intuition , one can choose the core - reservoir partitioning such that different methods are applied only to the set of bath modes for which they are expected to work .",
    "we demonstrate our approach by applying it to the spin - boson model and treating the system and core using the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba)@xcite this approach yields a methodology which is numerically cheap while obtaining impressive quantitative accuracy over all regimes investigated as well as offering excellent scaling with the number of system states .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ ssec : ehren ] briefly reviews the ehrenfest methodology .",
    "this background is then used in sec .",
    "[ ssec : hybrid ] , to derive the rdm - hybrid approach .",
    "section  [ sec : spinboson ] then describes how this scheme can be applied to the spin - boson model .",
    "the results of the application are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , and sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] concludes .",
    "while there are many routes to the mean - field ehrenfest equations of motion and subsequently the rdm - hybrid method to be presented below , we proceed via the quantum - classical liouville equation , which provides a particularly simple derivation .",
    "we begin by considering the generic coupled system - bath hamiltonian , @xmath0 where the free bath hamiltonian is @xmath1\\ ] ] and the coupling is assumed to be of the form @xmath2    the dynamics of the total density matrix , @xmath3 , is given by the liouville equation , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where henceforth we set @xmath5 . by employing the partial wigner transform of the density matrix with respect to the @xmath6 environmental degrees of freedom , @xmath7 and taking the classical limit of the corresponding partial wigner transformed liouville equation ( for more details , see e.g. ref .  ) , one obtains the so - called quantum - classical liouville equation @xmath8 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{4em } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\big\\ { h^w,\\rho^w(t ) \\big\\ } + \\big\\ { \\rho^w(t ) , h^w \\big\\ } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 $ ] denotes a commutator and @xmath10 is the poisson bracket .",
    "now , one makes the approximation that the system and bath reduced density matrices ( rdms ) decouple at all times , @xmath11 with the system rdm @xmath12 and bath rdm @xmath13 $ ] . inserting this product form into the quantum - classical liouville equation and noting that the bath reduced density matrix is simply the classical phase space distribution , @xmath14 one obtains the mean - field ehrenfest equations of motion@xcite for the system rdm , @xmath15 \\nonumber\\\\      & = -i \\big [ h_s + \\sum_i f_i(s ) g_i\\big(\\mathbf{q}(t)\\big ) , \\rho_s(t ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\      & \\equiv -i \\big [ \\tilde{h}_{s}(t ) , \\rho_s(t ) \\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the classical bath degrees of freedom , @xmath16 \\nonumber\\\\      & = -\\frac{\\partial v(q_k)}{\\partial q_k }      - \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial g_i\\big(\\mathbf{q}(t)\\big)}{\\partial q_k } { \\rm tr}_{s } \\big\\ { f_i \\rho_s(t ) \\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ehrenfest approximation to an observable of the reduced system is given by @xmath17 in accordance with the classical treatment of the bath , this latter integral is evaluated by molecular dynamics obeying the equations of motion given above . to generate the canonical ensemble average consistent with the initial density matrix @xmath18 one averages over classical trajectories with bath initial conditions sampled from either the wigner - transformed bath density operator , @xmath19 or more simply from the classical boltzmann distribution , @xmath20",
    "although the wigner distribution gives initial conditions consistent with the exact quantum distribution , this property is not conserved by the classical dynamics .",
    "in contrast to the approach taken above , in which the full hamiltonian is split into a system and bath with coupling between the two , we instead divide the bath degrees of freedom into two sets : the reservoir modes ( @xmath21 ) to be treated classically and the core modes ( @xmath22 ) to be treated quantum mechanically . hence , we partition the hamiltonian as @xmath23 where the system - core hamiltonian is @xmath24 and the system - core and system - reservoir couplings are defined as @xmath25    since nothing in our above discussion of ehrenfest dynamics utilized the specific properties of the system , we could just as well re - label the _ combined system and core _ as the _ system _ of the previous section . likewise , we associate the _ reservoir _ with the _ bath _ from before . thus we assume the total ( wigner - transformed ) density matrix factorizes at all times into a system - core rdm and reservoir rdm , @xmath26 taking the classical limit we arrive at the ehrenfest - like rdm - hybrid equations of motion for the system - core density matrix , @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\      & = -i \\big [ h_s + \\sum_i f_i(s ) g_i\\big(\\mathbf{q}(t)\\big ) , \\rho_{sc}(t ) \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\      & \\equiv -i \\big [ \\tilde{h}_{s}(t ) , \\rho_{sc}(t ) \\big ] , \\label{eq : rhosc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the classical bath degrees of freedom , @xmath28 \\nonumber\\\\      & = -\\frac{\\partial v(q_k)}{\\partial q_k }      - \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial g_i\\big(\\mathbf{q}(t)\\big)}{\\partial q_k } { \\rm tr}_s { \\rm tr}_c \\big\\ { f_i \\rho_{sc}(t ) \\big\\}. \\label{eq : batheom2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the exact calculation of the system - core density matrix dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhosc ] ) is extremely demanding , this was essentially the approach taken by wang , thoss , and miller ( wtm)@xcite who averaged high - dimensional wavefunction trajectories with initial conditions of the core wavefunction sampled from the exact quantum mechanical core density matrix and classical reservoir degrees of freedom sampled from the quantum - classical wigner distribution .",
    "the important point we seek to make in this work is that @xmath29 is a pure system operator , i.e. the core and reservoir are not directly coupled , such that the classical reservoir equation of motion above may be written @xmath30 where we have introduced the system rdm , @xmath31 , averaged over the quantum core degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of any dynamical system variable is given by an expression analogous to the pure ehrenfest approximation above , @xmath32 which again only requires the system rdm ( and _ not _ the much higher - dimensional system - core rdm ) , with classical reservoir trajectories to be sampled from an appropriate distribution .",
    "we have thus arrived at a self - consistent dynamical scheme which treats the core bath modes quantum mechanically yet only requires the propagation of a typical system rdm and classical reservoir degrees of freedom .",
    "this rdm - hybrid formulation presented above constitutes the major theoretical result of this work .",
    "we point out that a similar approach appears to have been investigated by golosov et al.@xcite , though it was restricted to their previously developed memory - equation algorithm@xcite and only minimally pursued .",
    "when the system rdm averaged over the quantum core modes , @xmath33 , is treated fully quantum mechanically , our methodology yields the exact result when all bath modes are included in the core .",
    "however , in practice one expects to achieve numerical convergence before this limit is reached .",
    "of course , the exact quantum dynamical treatment of the system rdm is in general no less numerically challenging than the original problem ( a system coupled to a quantum bath ) .",
    "however , the advantage of this approach is that one can tailor the partitioning in eq .",
    "( [ eq : partition ] ) either to alleviate the computational expenses of a numerically exact reduced quantum dynamics method ( such as the quapi - based iterative tensor propagation scheme of makri et al.@xcite ) or to improve the accuracy of approximated quantum dynamics ( such as a perturbative quantum master equation ) for the system rdm . in this sense ,",
    "the above presented formalism outlines a _ framework _ for the efficient partitioning and calculation of real - time reduced quantum dynamics where one can employ any exact or approximate dynamical scheme for the system rdm depending on the complexity of the problem . as discussed in the following section , here we adopt an approximate treatment of the system rdm using a perturbative master equation to yield a very cheap hybrid methodology with impressive quantitative accuracy .",
    "while the above formalism is indeed quite general here we demonstrate its effectiveness at treating the spin - boson hamiltonian , @xmath34/2,\\ ] ] which describes a two - level system with energy bias @xmath35 and tunneling matrix element @xmath36 , linearly coupled to the coordinates of a bath of harmonic oscillators . the spin - boson hamiltonian has been used as a model for a variety of physically distinct quantum relaxation and transport processes .",
    "a principal observable of interest is the population variable , @xmath37 \\equiv \\langle \\sigma_z(t ) \\rangle,\\ ] ] which measures the difference in population of sites 1 and 2 .",
    "furthermore , we will henceforth work in reduced units with respect to the tunneling matrix element , @xmath36 , in addition setting @xmath38 . to begin our application",

    "the harmonic bath in the spin boson problem is fully specified by its spectral density @xmath39 when separating the bath modes into a core and reservoir , we will require that @xmath40 intending to treat high frequency modes in the quantum mechanical core and low frequency modes in the classical reservoir , we use a switching function , @xmath41 , which switches from 1 to 0 as @xmath42 goes from 0 to @xmath43 .",

    "it is straightforward to see that using a step function switching like that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : step ] ) will result in a long - time oscillatory tail in the bath correlation function , @xmath47 , and thus extensive non - markovian effects which are difficult to treat quantum mechanically .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to separate the spectral density using a smooth switching function which can yield a short bath correlation time for the core modes and allow for efficient quantum mechanical treatment .    for our purposes a switching function of the form , @xmath48 ^ 2 & \\omega < \\omega^ * \\\\ 0 & \\omega >",

    "[ fig : split ] , we show the bath correlation function when this function is applied to the debye spectral density , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the reorganization energy . as can be seen",
    ", this smooth switching does not introduce any long - time tails and allows the bath correlation time for the core modes to be decreased as @xmath43 is increased and more of the slow modes , which give rise to temporally non - local effects , are moved into the reservoir . in addition , removal of slow modes from the core encourages the use of approximate master equations , such as the noninteracting blip approximation discussed in the next section , which complement the ehrenfest treatment of the slow modes .",

    "although the rdm - hybrid framework allows for the application of many approaches to treat the system and core modes , in this work we employ the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba)@xcite . to see why such a choice is computationally simple , note that because the fluctuating classical degrees of freedom provide an effective time - dependent bias , the system hamiltonian no longer commutes with itself at different times , and thus its propagator is a cumbersome time - ordered exponential ( dyson series ) .",
    "however , since niba only treats the diagonal part of this hamiltonian exactly , its propagator is trivially calculated .",
    "another important reason for our choice is the complementarity between niba and ehrenfest . while ehrenfest dynamics work best in the adiabatic regime , @xmath51 , niba is perturbative in @xmath52 , thus working best in the non - adiabatic regime , @xmath53 . to exemplify this complementarity , in fig .",

    "as alluded to above , when high frequency baths are present , wigner sampling can improve the accuracy of ehrenfest dynamics since the initial conditions are consistent with the exact quantum mechanical distribution .",
    "however , since the zero - point energy inserted by wigner sampling is not conserved by the classical dynamics , long - time predictions can be unreliable ( zero - point energy leakage)@xcite .",
    "hence , in regimes with strong coupling or high bath frequencies , sampling from either the classical boltzmann or quantum wigner distributions can produce inaccurate results .",
    "in contrast , for our rdm - hybrid approach we find that the results are largely insensitive to the choice of reservoir initial conditions , since most quantum mechanical modes are included in the core leading to only low frequencies being present in the reservoir , for which classical and wigner sampling give identical results .",

    "this deficiency of the ehrenfest approach and similar quantum - classical methods for biased system is well - known and typically connected to unphysical treatment of zero - point energy in classical treatments .",
    "attempts to correct this behavior have included an adjustable zero - point energy parameter for sampling the initial conditions @xcite and its determination by comparison with exact short - time moments.@xcite    in spite of this potential concern , we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : adiabaticbias ] that the rdm - hybrid approach performs incredibly well and equally so for both unbiased and biased systems .",
    "unfortunately , this success is not universal , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonadiabaticbias ] , which considers the effect of a bias on non - adiabatic dynamics .",
    "while rdm - hybrid is very successful for the unbiased case , it performs more poorly in the presence of a bias .",
    "this error appears to be attributable to the ehrenfest dynamics , which rdm - hybrid tracks quite closely at short times .",
    "nonetheless , the rdm - hybrid population does appear to approach the correct long - time value , which both ehrenfest and niba incorrectly predict .",
    "to summarize , we have formulated a quantum - classical methodology for the quantum dynamics of a coupled system - bath hamiltonian , averaged over the bath degrees of freedom , by employing a core - reservoir partitioning of the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "unlike the technique of wang , thoss , and miller@xcite , our rdm - hybrid approach avoids the use of expensive wavefunction - based quantum mechanics , replacing it by a reduced density matrix calculation .",
    "this allows for flexibility to use a variety of inexpensive approximate approaches for different parts of the computation , allowing for combined accuracy and efficiency .    within the above framework",
    ", we then used the noninteracting blip approximation ( niba ) for the reduced dynamics , yielding an efficient , scalable quantum dynamics methodology with excellent accuracy for both adiabatic and non - adiabatic parameter regimes . specifically , for @xmath103 discrete states , a numerical implementation of niba scales only as @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : niba ] ) ) , which allows for very efficient investigation of bigger systems .",
    "the largest discrepancy with exact results was found in the non - adiabatic regime with an energetic bias . to alleviate such deficiencies , we enumerate a number of avenues for future work .",
    "one could imagine pursuing alternative approximate treatments of the quantum core - averaged system rdm .",
    "for example , the accuracy of niba ( employed here ) is known to degrade at low temperature , in particular for biased systems .",
    "the redfield equations , on the other hand , have been very successfully applied to such systems , being restricted , however , to weak - coupling and non - adiabatic baths .",
    "thus , an rdm - hybrid approach employing redfield and ehrenfest dynamics may be one way to extend the validity of the redfield equations into these regimes where it would otherwise fail .",
    "ideally , one would like an exact treatment of the quantum system rdm , such that the method becomes numerically exact when all modes are included in the core . as alluded to at the end of sec .",
    "[ ssec : hybrid ] , we believe the tensor propagation scheme of makri et al .",
    "@xcite is especially promising . because the quapi algorithm scales exponentially with the memory time required to span the bath correlation function ,",
    "the partitioning discussed here leading to a reduced bath correlation time would constitute an enormous reduction in computational expense .",
    "work along this direction is currently in progress .",
    "lastly , for a chosen system - core dynamics method , a more rigorous investigation of the form of the switching function , @xmath41 , and switching frequency , @xmath43 , should be pursued . ideally these choices should be automated and not left up to physical considerations as was done here .",
    "for example , one might try comparing the short - time moments of the population dynamics to those obtained exactly from quantum perturbation theory .",
    "the investigation of this point will be a subject of future work .    in spite of these desired improvements",
    ", the rdm - hybrid method employing niba has been shown to be very accurate , often correcting the long - time populations of the otherwise accurate ehrenfest dynamics .",
    "future work will include the application and investigation of both of these methods to models of electronic energy transfer in molecular aggregates , including the multi - site frenkel exciton hamiltonian describing the fenna - matthews - olsen complex , a prototypical photosynthetic system .",
