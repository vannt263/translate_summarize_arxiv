    "in some applications of imaging and microscopy , the damage that is inflicted on a sample while its image is taken is the main limit on what kind of samples _ can _ be imaged . particularly in electron microscopy , the large radiation dose that any sample receives can make the imaging of , e.g. , living biological samples impossible  @xcite .",
    "hence , reducing sample damage is crucial for future developments of electron microscopy .",
    "next to other proposals  @xcite , a quantum mechanical protocol called `` interaction - free measurement '' ( ifm ) , previously proven to work with photons  @xcite , has been proposed as a means to this end  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of interaction - free measurements is to exploit the wave - like features of quantum particles in order to gain information about an object while reducing the interaction between particle and object to a minimum .",
    "this is accomplished by confining the probe particle in a resonator in which it makes multiple round trips . during each round trip ,",
    "a small part of the wave ( the `` sample wave '' ) is split off from the original trajectory ( the `` reference wave '' ) and sent through the sample .",
    "after many round trips , the presence of a sample can be inferred from the intensity of the reference wave even though the total intensity in the sample wave has been arbitrarily small .",
    "this is explained in detail in section  [ ifm ] .",
    "the field of interaction - free measurements started with a discussion on `` negative - result '' measurements , where the location of an object is inferred from _ not _ being measured with a detector  @xcite , which leads to a change in the wave function of the object  @xcite .",
    "elitzur and vaidman proposed an ifm scheme employing a mach - zehnder interferometer which sometimes detects an absorbing object without any absorption occurring  @xcite . in this simple interferometric scheme ,",
    "only some measurement runs constitute a successful ifm while the probe particle is absorbed in the other runs .",
    "the rate of successful ifm runs can be increased arbitrarily close to @xmath1 in more elaborate interferometric setups with multiple round trips through the path containing the sample  @xcite .",
    "all applications of interaction - free measurements may come with imperfect absorbers like semitransparent objects .",
    "previous work on semitransparency in ifms has shown that the rate of successful ifm runs is reduced if a semitransparent object is to be detected instead of a perfect absorber  @xcite .",
    "this can be compensated by increasing the number of round trips in the interferometer  @xcite . in this article , we study the effect of semitransparent samples in ifm setups , and we calculate the damage that arises during either an ifm or a conventional measurement in two different situations relevant for imaging : ( 1 ) discriminating between two objects which have different transparencies or ( 2 ) determining the transparency of an object .",
    "we also compare our results to a lower bound for the damage in general quantum measurements of semitransparency , which was derived by massar , mitchison , and pironio for a generalization of interaction - free measurements  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we discuss the effect of phase shifts in ifms .    most of the previous discussion of interaction - free measurements has been focused on the detection of absorbing objects using photons as probe particles .",
    "hence , such measurement schemes have sometimes also been called `` absorption - free '' measurements  @xcite . especially if other probe particles like electrons  @xcite or neutrons  @xcite are considered , however , it should be noted that the ifms are not only absorption - free but also free of any process that prevents the probe particle s wavefunction from continuing undisturbed on its original path . scattering out of the path or momentum - changing collisions turn out to have the same effect as absorption .",
    "therefore , we will call all these processes `` loss '' , as in `` lost for further interaction with the reference wave '' .",
    "many of the interaction processes , such as inelastic scattering or electron knock - out processes , cause damage to the sample , which can be prevented using ifm schemes . while the relationship between loss and damage is complicated and depends on the specific setup and sample",
    ", we will assume in the following that a higher probability of `` loss '' means more damage .",
    "interaction - free measurements open up novel applications in cases where sample damage is particularly disruptive .",
    "next to electron microscopy  @xcite , other potential applications are the imaging of photo - sensitive materials  @xcite or single - atom detection  @xcite .        ,",

    "there are several different schemes to achieve ifm with a high success rate that have been proposed  @xcite or realized  @xcite in the literature .",
    "most of them employ techniques based on the quantum zeno effect , where frequent measurements prevent a quantum system from changing its state  @xcite .",
    "it is this kind of `` quantum - zeno - like '' ifm setup that we will discuss in this article .",
    "example schemes are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] for either photons or electrons as probe particles .",
    "we can describe the probe particle in a quantum - zeno - like ifm setup as a three - state system .",

    "[ sketch ] , the coupling between the two states is achieved via a beam splitter .",
    "the third state of the system is the loss state @xmath6 .",
    "it keeps track of the probability that the particle is lost in a sample interaction , for example due to absorption or scattering .",
    "note that @xmath6 may be a continuum of states .",
    "we start out with the particle in the reference state @xmath4 .",
    "the coupling strength between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is such that , in the absence of a sample , the particle is fully in @xmath5 after @xmath11 round trips , i.e. , @xmath11 encounters with the beam splitter .",

    "an encounter of the particle with an opaque sample constitutes a measurement of the state of the particle with two possible outcomes : either the particle is still in the reference state , and the oscillation restarts from there , or the particle is in the sample state , where it is subsequently lost .",
    "the presence of the sample therefore inhibits the coherent evolution from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",

    ", the observer measures the state of the particle and determines whether it is in @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 .",
    "this way , the following information about the sample is obtained : if the particle is still in state @xmath4 or if it is lost in @xmath6 , there must be an opaque sample blocking the evolution to @xmath5 . if the particle is found in @xmath5 at time @xmath7",
    ", the sample is transparent ( or there is no sample ) .",
    "an interaction - free measurement is successful if the presence of the sample is detected without loss via a probe particle in @xmath4 . to achieve a high success rate , the probability of finding the particle in @xmath6 needs to be minimized .",
    "the loss probability @xmath3 depends on the number of round trips @xmath11 , and is given by  @xcite @xmath13 which converges to @xmath14 for @xmath15 , see fig .",
    "[ rabi ]  ( c ) .",
    "thus , in principle , the existence of a sample can be ascertained without loss . for an intuitive picture of why more sample encounters ultimately lead to less loss in an ifm ,",
    "consider the following : while doubling @xmath11 doubles the number of sample encounters , the loss probability during each interaction is reduced by a factor of @xmath16 because the coherent build - up of probability in @xmath5 is approximately quadratic .",
    "note that the calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ rabi ] assume a continuous coupling between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which occurs in some proposals for ifm  @xcite , while other proposals and the scheme in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] work with one discrete coupling step in every round trip  @xcite . instead of the continuous oscillation of probabilities shown in fig .",
    "[ rabi ]  ( a ) , the oscillation proceeds in discrete steps for a discrete coupling .",
    "these different couplings lead to the same results in this paper because the particle - sample interaction also occurs in discrete steps .",
    "( a ) , @xmath17 ( b ) , @xmath18 ( c ) . shown are the probabilities @xmath19 ( dotted blue line ) , @xmath2 ( dashed red line ) , and @xmath3 ( black line ) for @xmath8 . ]",
    "so far , we have considered only fully opaque samples , which completely block the coherent build - up of the probe particle wave function in the sample state .",
    "this `` all - or - nothing '' ifm scheme is fully loss - free in the limit @xmath15 and thus outperforms any classical detection in terms of sample damage .",
    "we now investigate the effect of semitransparent samples in quantum - zeno - like ifm setups , which are more reminiscent of real - world samples relevant for imaging , e.g. , biological samples .",
    "if a particle encounters a semitransparent sample with a transparency @xmath20 , it passes the sample with probability @xmath20 or it is lost with probability @xmath21 .",
    "lost ( i.e. , absorbed or scattered ) particles are the cause of damage during imaging . additionally , the sample may cause a phase shift @xmath22 of the particle s wavefunction .",
    "one encounter with the semitransparent sample leads to the following modification of the particle s amplitudes @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in the three states @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 : @xmath26 note that this can be thought of as a combination of a unitary transformation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and a measurement of whether the particle is in @xmath6 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite for different but equivalent approaches of describing the interaction with a semitransparent sample ) .",
    "the loss from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is irreversible and the state @xmath6 merely serves to ` count ' the lost amplitude .",
    "for @xmath27 we recover the fully opaque case discussed in the last section .",

    "we can now simulate the ifm scheme with arbitrary semitransparent samples by starting a particle in the state @xmath36 at @xmath37 , using a time propagator to simulate the coherent evolution from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and periodically interrupting this process @xmath11 times with a sample encounter according to eq .",

    "this confirms that the continuous and discrete couplings in different ifm setups lead to the same result , as discussed in the last section .",

    "most sources of particles that may be used for imaging or ifm , however , do not produce such number states of particles . instead , only the average number of particles @xmath107 in any given amount of time is typically known , while the actual number @xmath83 follows poissonian statistics .",
    "we will now discuss how this affects both classical and ifm measurements of semitransparency .",
    "if we consider a classical measurement with a poissonian source of particles , we need to distinguish two cases : whether the number of lost particles can be detected or whether it is unknown .",
    "for example , lost electrons in electron microscopy are usually scattered by the sample , so the number of lost particles can be measured , while lost photons in light microscopy are often absorbed , so the number of lost particles is unknown .",
    "both the number of detected and the number of lost particles obey a poisson distribution with average number @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the numbers of detected and lost particles in an ifm scheme also follow poissonian statistics with average numbers @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "if lost particles can be measured and the information from all measurements is combined , the error and number of lost particles in poissonian and binomial statistics are approximately identical .",
    "this is because the number of all particles is counted in this case .",
    "significant differences only occur if the number of lost particles is not accessible . in this case , the normal approximation of the poisson distribution yields the expected number of lost particles , similar to the previous section : @xmath113 the only difference to the binomial case given in eq .",
    "[ normapprox2 ] is the dependence on @xmath89 here vs.  @xmath114 there .",
    "this shows that the poisson distribution behaves similarly to the binomial distribution for small signals @xmath89 but loses more particles for large signals .",
    "as we will see below , this feature of the poisson distribution leads to a large amount of loss for classical measurements of high transparencies , which allows ifms to outperform classical measurements there .",
    "we now compare the expected number of lost particles in classical measurements and ifms for different transparencies .",
    "we do not use the normal approximation in the calculation because it is invalid for @xmath89 close to @xmath14 .",
    "instead , we use the @xmath115 method to obtain the confidence intervals .",
    "apart from this , the calculation is identical to the clopper - pearson calculation in the previous section .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ poisson ] , which shows the expected number of lost particles in classical and interaction - free measurements of an unknown transparency @xmath20 .",
    "it is the same as fig .",
    "[ clop ] except for poissonian statistics instead of binomial statistics , assuming that the number of lost particles _ can not _ be measured .",
    "first of all , we find that the amount of lost particles using poissonian statistics is always higher than using binomial statistics . for @xmath116",
    ", we find that ifms achieve the same level of uncertainty as classical measurements with fewer lost particles .",
    "for very high transparencies @xmath117 , they can cause over an order of magnitude less loss . for low transparencies @xmath118 on the other hand ,",
    "classical measurements show the least amount of loss .",
    "similar results hold in the comparison of two transparencies . if two transparencies @xmath119 are to be distinguished , ifm schemes perform better than classical measurements even if the contrast is not large",
    ". for high contrast , the great reduction of loss discussed in section  [ twotra ] also works with poisson distributions .",
    "we conclude that , in addition to the case of high contrast , interaction - free measurements also outperform classical measurements for a particle source with poissonian statistics if @xmath116 and if the number of lost particles can not be detected .",
    "so far , we have discussed semitransparent samples without any phase shift of the probe particle . in this section ,",
    "we assume a fully transparent sample @xmath43 , which induces a phase shift @xmath22 during every round trip .",
    "after @xmath11 round trips , the particle can be either in the reference state @xmath4 or in the sample state @xmath5 .",
    "results for the probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath2 at time @xmath7 for different @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ deltaphi ] . for @xmath29 or a multiple of @xmath120",
    ", the particle is always found in @xmath5 after @xmath7 . if @xmath121 , we see that the probabilities are simply @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this configuration is equivalent to a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "if @xmath11 becomes larger , the probability is transferred from @xmath5 to @xmath4 for smaller phase shifts . for large @xmath11",
    ", almost any phase shift leads to the particle being found in @xmath4 after @xmath7 .",
    "a possible application of this behavior may be the detection of small phase shifts",
    ".     induced by the sample for @xmath121 ( a ) , @xmath124 ( b ) , and @xmath75 ( c ) .",
    "shown here are @xmath19 ( dotted blue line ) and @xmath2 ( dashed red line ) . ]    in an ifm measurement with large @xmath11 , a transparent sample with a phase shift @xmath22 will most likely appear the same as an opaque sample .",
    "the phase shift leads to a dephasing of sample state and reference state and thus prevents the coherent transfer of amplitude from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . in general",
    ", ifm does not allow for the distinction between whether the sample induces a phase shift or whether the sample is opaque .",
    "however , if the phase shift is known , it can be compensated with an opposite phase shift .",
    "so if two transparencies with a high contrast are to be distinguished and the phase shift induced by the sample with high transparency is known , ifm can still be used by applying an inverse phase shift to the sample state in the ifm setup .",
    "in conclusion , interaction - free measurements outperform classical measurements of transparency in special cases .",
    "first , we find that ifms achieve lower loss than classical measurements when samples with a high contrast are to be imaged , which is an approximation of the standard `` all - or - nothing '' ifm and works the same way .",
    "thus , ifms may significantly reduce the sample damage in imaging of high - contrast samples . note that the contrast of samples can be artificially enhanced . in transmission electron microscopy for example , staining a sample with metal nanoparticles may be used to achieve a high contrast  @xcite .",
    "a second regime where interaction - free measurements achieve the same result as classical measurements with fewer lost particles is when the number of particles sent in exhibits a poisson distribution , the number of lost particles can not be measured , and the transparency is greater than approximately @xmath0 . in this case , the advantage of ifms is not due to an exploitation of the quantum zeno effect but due to statistical properties of the poisson distribution .    finally , we have shown that phase shifts of a sample have to be compensated for in order to measure the transparency of the sample in an ifm .",
    "this is because a sample with a non - zero phase shift may appear the same as an opaque sample .",
    "conversely , the sensitivity of ifms to phase shifts may be exploited to detect small phase shifts in transparent samples .",
    "we thank all the members of the quantum electron microscope collaboration for excellent scientific discussions .",
    "this research is funded by the gordon and betty moore foundation ."
