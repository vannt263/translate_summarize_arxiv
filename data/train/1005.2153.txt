    "rydberg atoms have attracted a lot of research interests in the last decades thanks to their exaggerated properties  @xcite . among these properties",
    "is their large interaction strength , which is enhanced by many orders of magnitude compared to ground state atoms .",
    "this long - range interaction between two rydberg atoms has led to a wealth of studies .",
    "for example it was suggested  @xcite and recently demonstrated  @xcite that two or more rydberg atoms or rydberg and ground state atoms can be bound into exotic giant molecules using photo - association techniques .",
    "another example where the strong interaction plays a role is the rydberg blockade , an effect where , in a volume smaller than the interaction range , only one atom of an ensemble can be excited into a rydberg state .    until recently",
    ", the excitation of atoms to rydberg states was performed using non - coherent laser excitation , usually in multiple steps .",
    "this technique led , for example , to the observation of the rydberg blockade in clouds of ultra - cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the coherent excitation of atoms to rydberg states has been demonstrated only in recent years , starting with experiments using cold thermal clouds of atoms  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "it was followed by the demonstration of the coherent rydberg excitation of individual atoms trapped in tight optical dipole traps  @xcite . along these lines ,",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency has been reported in room temperature atomic vapor  @xcite and microcells  @xcite , as well as in cold atomic clouds  @xcite , where also coherent population trapping  @xcite has been observed recently .",
    "all those demonstrations were also made possible by the technical development of easy to handle laser light sources , especially in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum , that provide a sufficient amount of power and good stability .",
    "this progress in the coherent manipulation of atoms between ground and rydberg states is accompanied by an increased interest on the theoretical side .",
    "it was recognized that rydberg atoms can play an important role in the field of quantum information processing , using either atomic ensembles or arrays of individual atoms  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a recent review ) . in these proposals ,",
    "stable ground states of single atoms are used as qubit states @xcite and the controlled coherent interaction between the qubits can be realized via an auxiliary rydberg state .",
    "more generally the long - range interaction between atoms can be tailored and used to engineer quantum states of an ensemble of atoms or to perform quantum simulations  @xcite .",
    "a main ingredient of those proposals is the coherent excitation of an atom to a rydberg state and the rydberg blockade .",
    "recently the coherent excitation of individual atoms trapped in tight optical dipole traps led to the observation of controlled interactions between two individual rydberg atoms by two groups  @xcite .",
    "this work was followed by the demonstration of the entanglement of two atoms  @xcite and of a controlled not gate  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present in detail the coherent excitation of individual atoms that we used in experiments reported in ref .",
    "in particular we describe the details of the experimental setup and techniques , and investigate the performance of the experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_setup ] ,",
    "we present the experimental setup and the laser system used to excite the atoms in the rydberg state .",
    "we also detail the experimental procedure used to align the lasers and to detect the rydberg excitation of the atom .",
    "section  [ section_spectroscopy ] deals with the rydberg state spectroscopy on a single atom with some emphasis on the level @xmath0 . in section  [ section_rabi ]",
    ", we present rabi oscillations between the ground and the rydberg state of a single atom .",
    "moreover , we compare these measurements with numerical calculations from a model which includes our independently measured experimental imperfections .",
    "in this section we present briefly the experimental setup and the trapping of single @xmath1rb atoms in optical tweezers which has been described in earlier publications @xcite .",
    "we then detail the laser system used for the excitation of the atom from the ground state to a rydberg state .",
    "we present the alignment technique of the laser beams on the atom . as an aside",
    ", we use this procedure to estimate the photo - ionization cross - section from the state @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we discuss the detection of a successful excitation of the atom in the rydberg state .",

    "the trap is loaded from an optical molasses created by three retro - reflected cooling beams with a power of about 3  mw per beam collimated to a waist of @xmath6  mm .",
    "the detuning of the cooling laser from the @xmath7 to @xmath8 transition is @xmath9 , where @xmath10  mhz is the decay rate of the @xmath2 level .",

    "we detect the presence of a single atom in the dipole trap by its fluorescence light induced by the optical molasses laser beams .",
    "the fluorescence photons are collected using the same high numerical aperture lens and detected on an avalanche photo - diode ( apd ) in single photon counting mode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . due to the small trapping volume",
    "the number of atoms in the dipole trap is either zero or one @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the atom in the optical tweezers is about 70  @xmath16k , which was measured using a release - and - recapture technique @xcite .",
    "we use a two - photon transition to excite a @xmath1rb atom from its @xmath17 ground state to the desired rydberg level @xmath0 .",
    "we have chosen this particular state for experiments involving two atoms in neighboring traps  @xcite , because of the existence of a frster resonance @xcite between the two - atom states @xmath18 and @xmath19 which enhances the interaction energy between the atoms .",
    "the @xmath20 excited state of the d1-line of rubidium is the intermediate level .",
    "therefore , we need a laser at 795  nm and a second laser at 475  nm . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , the 475  nm laser is @xmath13-polarized and travels along the quantization axis which is defined by a magnetic field of 9  g along the @xmath21-axis . in the chamber we have about 35  mw of 475  nm light available which is focused to a spot of 20  @xmath16 m at the position of the atom .",
    "the @xmath14-polarized 795  nm laser has a power of about 7  mw , is applied onto the atoms from the side along the @xmath22-axis and has a waist of 130  @xmath16 m .",
    "the fast switching ( rise - time @xmath23  ns ) of the blue and red laser beams is done using electro - optic modulators .",
    "we have chosen the intensities of the lasers such , that the excitation towards the rydberg state is fast enough ( @xmath24100  ns ) to ensure passive phase coherence between the two lasers for the duration of the excitation pulse ( see more details below ) .",
    "the lasers are not actively phase - locked and we control only the frequencies of the lasers with respect to the atomic transitions .",
    "the 795  nm laser is an external cavity diode laser ( toptica dl100 ) which is locked by a feedback loop acting on the grating piezo - electric transducer . as a reference we use the d1-line of @xmath1rb , more precisely the transition between levels @xmath7 and @xmath25 .",
    "the lock scheme relies on a saturated absorption spectroscopy .",
    "the error signal is generated using a lock - in technique by modulating the laser diode current at a frequency of 80  khz .",
    "the frequency of the laser is then additionally shifted by a detuning @xmath26 towards the blue of the transition with an acousto - optical modulator to avoid populating the intermediate state .",
    "the 475  nm laser is a frequency doubling system ( toptica ta - shg ) .",
    "we stabilize the fundamental wavelength of the 950  nm master laser , as well an external cavity diode laser , by feedback onto its grating piezo - electric transducer .",
    "here , we use a fabry - perot cavity to fix the 950  nm laser relative to the 795  nm laser , which gives us more freedom in the choice of the rydberg state we are addressing . both ,",
    "the 795  nm and the 950  nm laser , are coupled to the permanently scanning cavity which has a finesse @xmath27 and a free spectral range of 300  mhz .",
    "the cavity is continuously sweeped with a scan frequency of about 100  hz across the transmission peaks of both lasers .",
    "our locking scheme relies on the stabilization of the separation between these two transmission peaks in the sweep .",
    "we use a home - made circuit to convert the time difference into a voltage . when the signal on the photodiode behind the cavity exceeds for the first time a threshold value , an integrator is started and accumulates a voltage until the photodiode signal exceeds the threshold value for the second time . subtracting",
    "this value with a set voltage generates an error signal , which is treated and fed back onto the 950  nm laser .",
    "this locking technique is only suitable for compensating long - term drifts of the laser , since the bandwidth of the correcting signal is low and depends on the frequency of the fabry - perot cavity sweep .",
    "moreover this method relies on the fact that the cavity piezo responds linearly , that the sweep has a very good stability in frequency and that the cavity has slow drifts . despite those constraints we were able to stabilize the 795-m and 950-nm lasers with respect to each other to about 4  mhz for the duration of @xmath28 hour .",
    "we also checked the intrinsic short term stability of the 950  nm master laser using a self - heterodyne technique .",
    "this consists in observing a beat note of the laser with itself shifted in frequency by 80  mhz and delayed by @xmath29s using a 1.3  km long fiber .",
    "we have measured a fwhm of the beat signal of 210  khz , leading to a linewidth of the 950-nm laser of 105  khz  .",
    "using the same technique , we have measured a linewidth of the 795  nm laser of 600  khz , which is larger because of the current modulation used to lock it on the atomic transition .    however",
    ", this method does not allow to set the wavelength of the 950  nm laser absolutely , since we do not know a priori which longitudinal mode of the cavity we address .",
    "we use a wavelength meter with an absolute accuracy of 10  mhz ( highfinesse - ngstrom ws - u ) to set the frequency of the laser close to the desired frequency . the locking scheme described",
    "above has been used for all data shown in this paper and for the data discussed in @xcite . for the data in @xcite we used an even simpler method : the highfinesse - ngstrom wavemeter provides a pid control option that generates an error signal which can be used to stabilize the laser to any desired frequency with precision of 2  mhz .",
    "automatic recalibration of the wavemeter every 10  s using the 795  nm laser locked to @xmath1rb avoids long term drifts of the wavemeter .",
    "the limiting factor of this method is the absolute accuracy of the wavemeter , which is estimated around 5  mhz on the time scale of half an hour .      in order to reach a high two - photon rabi frequency with the limited power of the 475  nm laser available ,",
    "we need to maximize the intensity of the 475  nm light focused to a spot size of about @xmath30 m at the position of the atom . for this purpose",
    "we take advantage of the fact that light at @xmath31  nm photo - ionizes rubidium atoms from the @xmath2-state , see fig .",

    "the solid line is an exponential fit to the data and gives the photo - ionization rate @xmath33 .",
    "the inset demonstrates the linear dependence of the inverse of the decay time constant as the function of the blue laser intensity . ]    after we have prepared a single atom in the tweezers , we turn off the molasses beams and the atom is trapped in the dark .",
    "after 31  ms from the start of the sequence we illuminate the atom with both , the 475  nm laser beam and the optical molasses beams .",
    "the optical molasses creates population in the excited @xmath2-state from where the 475  nm light photo - ionizes the atom which is consequently lost from the trap . fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization](b ) shows a typical trace of the observed fluorescence signal averaged over 100 experimental runs .",
    "we observe a peak in the fluorescence when the lasers are switched on which decays exponentially to a value corresponding to the background of the molasses beams and indicating that the atom is lost .",
    "a fit by an exponential decay gives the photo - ionization rate @xmath33 , which depends on the applied powers and on the beam alignments .",
    "we verified that the inverse of @xmath34 is proportional to the intensity of the 475  nm laser , see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization](b )",
    ". therefore , this method allows us to measure the beam waist of the 475  nm laser using the single atom as a probe . keeping the laser power fixed and evaluating the photo - ionization rate for different positions of the laser beam , we find @xmath35 m and @xmath36 m which correspond well to the values we expect for our optical setup .",
    "the laser beam is then centered onto the atom using the same method .",
    "the photo - ionization rate can also be used to estimate the photo - ionization cross section @xmath37 of @xmath1rb from the 5@xmath32 state .",
    "the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath33 is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the intensity and the frequency of the 475  nm laser , and @xmath41 is the population in the @xmath2 state .",
    "the population @xmath41 depends strongly on the parameters of the optical molasses and is given by : @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 are connected to clebsch - gordan coefficients  @xcite and have values of @xmath45  rb , because for the stretched states the clebsch - gordan coefficients are the same as for cs . ] .",
    "including the light - shift due to the dipole trap , the detuning of the optical molasses is @xmath46  mhz .",
    "the total rabi frequency on the cooling transition of the molasses is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48  c@xmath49 m is the transition dipole matrix element @xcite , and @xmath50 is the total intensity due to the optical molasses beams at the position of the atom .",
    "in our case , the estimation of this intensity can be done only approximately , since it is difficult to determine the position of the single atom within the beams .",
    "we estimate the population in the @xmath2 state @xmath41 to be between 1 and 8  % .",
    "this uncertainty contributes the most to the final uncertainty of the ionization cross section .    from the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : ionization](b ) we extract @xmath51  ms which was taken for a power of @xmath52  mw of the 475  nm laser .",
    "the values of the ionization cross section obtained for the two extreme populations @xmath41 of the 5@xmath32 state are @xmath53 despite our uncertainty on @xmath41 these values agree with theoretically predicted cross sections , which are between @xmath54 and @xmath55 from @xmath56-states to the ionization threshold @xcite , and with the experimentally measured values from the literature : @xmath57 at 476.5  nm ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we detect a successful excitation towards the rydberg state by a loss of the atom .",
    "our detection method is based on the fact that rydberg atoms are not trapped in our dipole trap , the light at 810  nm being even slightly anti - trapping for them . for a rydberg atom",
    "the electron can almost be considered as a free particle and therefore the thomson model can be applied to calculate the polarizability of the atom  @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the charge of the electron , @xmath60 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath61 is the frequency of the applied laser .",
    "since the light shift is proportional to @xmath62 , and in our case @xmath63 , the light shift is positive for all rydberg atoms , as long as we are far from any atomic resonance between the rydberg state and other levels .",
    "since the positive light shift is very small ( only @xmath64  mhz ) , the rydberg atoms leave the trapping region on a time scale that corresponds to their velocities at the temperature of @xmath65k .",
    "we have estimated the lifetime of a rydberg atom in the dipole trap by exciting it to the rydberg state ( see section  [ section_rabi ] ) and measuring the probability to drive it back to the ground state after a given time using a second laser pulse . after @xmath66s the atom has left the trapping region , which is faster than the radiative decay time back to the ground state which is on the order of @xmath67s @xcite . moreover",
    ", an atom can be photo - ionized by black - body radiation ( @xmath68s ) .",
    "photo - ionization by the dipole trap beam ( @xmath69ms  @xcite ) is negligible on these timescales .",
    "in this section we discuss how the desired rydberg line is initially localized in the spectrum . then we explain the optical pumping in state @xmath70 . from this initial state",
    "a two - photon spectroscopy of the @xmath0 level is performed on a single atom .      in order to initially locate the @xmath71-line and to have a proof of principle of the detection of rydberg atoms , we perform a spectroscopy of rydberg levels using a two - step excitation of the atoms via the @xmath2 level . for this particular measurement",
    "we use a two - step excitation at 780  nm and the blue laser is tuned to 480  nm . we run the optical tweezers with the optical molasses ( 780  nm ) continuously on and observe the fluorescence from single atoms entering and leaving the trap continuously on the apd while we scan the frequency of the blue laser .",
    "when its frequency hits one of the rydberg lines , the loading of the dipole trap is strongly perturbed , and the atomic fluorescence signal on the apd drops down to the background level .",
    "we have observed @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath41 lines for @xmath75 ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 , which have a typical separation of @xmath78  ghz .",
    "the positions of the lines found with this method coincide within @xmath79  mhz with respect to the calculated values , which were calculated using the quantum defect theory  @xcite . according to the selection rules , only @xmath72 and @xmath74 lines should be observable in a two step excitation .",
    "the presence of @xmath73 and @xmath41 lines indicates the existence of a residual electric field at the position of the atom .    with this spectroscopy method",
    ", we identified the @xmath0 line , which we use in further experiments .      in all further experiments",
    "we perform a direct two - photon excitation of a single atom trapped in the tweezers from its ground state @xmath70 .",

    "we also switch off the dipole trap for 600  ns to avoid light shifts due to the dipole trap laser light during the rydberg excitation . during this time window the 795-laser is switched on for @xmath93  ns to coherently excite the free atom to the rydberg state , as will be detailed in section  [ section_rabi ] . after this excitation",
    "the dipole trap is switched on again , which results in the loss of the atom if it was in the rydberg state and in its recapture in the optical tweezers otherwise .",

    "the width ( fwhm ) of this main peak is @xmath96  mhz .",
    "it is compatible with the expected width ( @xmath97  mhz ) using a square pulse with duration @xmath93  ns convoluted with the contribution from experimental imperfections ( @xmath98  mhz , see section  [ section_rabi ] ) .",

    "we calculate the position of this line to be at @xmath100  mhz using quantum defect theory and taking into account the light - shifts induced by the 795  nm and the 475  nm lasers and the zeeman shifts .",
    "the difference between the calculated and measured frequencies of @xmath101  mhz can have several reasons : an uncertainty of the light - shift induced by the 795  nm laser beam itself during the excitation ( @xmath102  mhz ) , or the absolute precision of the wavemeter ( @xmath103  mhz ) .",
    "moreover , stray electric fields , which we can not control on our setup , would also induce a shift .",
    "however , the calculated stark shift ( @xmath104 ) does not have the correct sign to explain the observed frequency difference .",
    "the origin of the satellite dip is not entirely clear at this stage and further investigation is required .",
    "a possible candidate is the imperfect optical pumping in the zeeman state that leaves population in @xmath105 . from that state",
    "the @xmath106 and @xmath107 levels can be excited by the two - photon transition .",
    "since the @xmath105 state is light - shifted by the 795  nm laser by a smaller amount than the @xmath70 state , due to a smaller clebsch - gordan coefficient connecting it to the corresponding zeeman state in level ( @xmath20 ) , we expect the side dip to be at a higher frequency of the 475  nm laser , as we observe it on the measured spectrum .",
    "this is also confirmed by the fact that changing the detuning @xmath26 from the intermediate state from positive to negative detuning changes the position of the side dip from the blue to the red side of the rydberg line .",
    "however , the area of this side dip seems to be too large to be explained only by about 5% imperfect optical pumping .",
    "another possible effect is the non - perfect polarization of the excitation laser at 475  nm .",
    "once the state @xmath108 is localized in the spectrum , we set the frequency of the blue laser to the center of the line . by varying the pulse duration @xmath89 of the 795  nm laser we observe rabi oscillations between the ground state @xmath70 and the rydberg state @xmath108 , demonstrating the coherence of the two - photon excitation .",

    "we include the power and frequency fluctuations of the two lasers by applying a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we assume that the power fluctuations of the red and the blue laser are both gaussian distributed , and are 2.5% and 5% ( fwhm ) , respectively , as measured independently .",
    "we note that these intensity fluctuations also lead to a fluctuation of the frequency of the transition due the light - shift induced by the lasers on this two - photon transition , respectively @xmath149 on the ground state and @xmath150 on the rydberg state . to take into account the frequency fluctuations of the lasers we assume a gaussian distribution of the two - photon detuning with respect to the transition @xmath151 .",
    "this procedure would also include a potential variation in the rydberg transition frequency by the stark effect due to a fluctuating stray electric field .",
    "we take into account the efficiency of the optical pumping of 95  @xmath152 by assuming that the remaining 5  % are in state @xmath139 . finally , we multiply the results of the simulation by 0.98 to account for the measured probability to recapture the atom at the end of the sequence in the absence of laser excitation .",
    "we average over 100 evolutions of the master equation , and the solution is shown for different values of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi ] as blue solid line . in order to have an idea of how the fluctuations influence the result we have added on the graphs of fig .  [ fig : rabi ] the dotted orange line which corresponds to the solution of the model , without including the frequency and power fluctuations of the lasers .",
    "the simulations are in good agreement with the measured data .",
    "for the simulations shown in blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi ] we assumed fluctuations ( fwhm ) of the two - photon detuning @xmath151 of 6  mhz in ( a ) , 4.5  mhz in ( b ) and 4  mhz in ( c ) . comparing them to the results without fluctuations , we identify two main factors limiting the population transfer to the rydberg state : the spontaneous emission from state @xmath133 and the fluctuations of laser frequency and intensity .",
    "the influence of the spontaneous emission can be reduced by decreasing the ratio @xmath153 , resulting in an increase of the contrast of the rabi oscillations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rabi](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "moreover , we estimate from our simulations , that if we would reduce the laser frequency fluctuations to @xmath154mhz , we could increase the rydberg excitation efficiency to @xmath155 .",
    "we finally note that the frequency fluctuation used in the model are compatible with the one estimated from measurements on the laser system ( see section  [ section_lasersetup ] ) . at the present stage of the experiment",
    "we therefore have no evidence of a fluctuation of the transition frequency due to stray electric fields .    as a last comment ,",
    "we conclude from the good agreement between the data and the model , that the result of the simulation is compatible with @xmath156 efficiency of the rydberg state detection we use on the experiment .",
    "we perform coherent excitation of single atoms to the rydberg state @xmath157 using a two - photon transition and observe rabi oscillations with a high contrast .",
    "the observed rabi frequency is about 7  mhz , which relaxes partially the requirements to the frequency stability of the laser system .",
    "the largest population transfer to the rydberg state observed is @xmath158 .",
    "the good agreement between the model and the data leads us to conclude that this maximal transfer efficiency is limited by the spontaneous emission from the intermediate state and the frequency stability of the excitation lasers . in future experiments",
    "the population of the intermediate level can be reduced by increasing the detuning from this level and using higher power in the blue beam to keep the two - photon rabi frequency high .",
