    "cosmic strings are one dimensional topological defects which may have been left behind by phase transitions in the early universe@xcite . in the zero width approximation",

    ", we have the freedom to impose several conditions on the functions that denote the string position , in other words to fix the gauge . the most convenient gauge for ordinary strings in flat spacetime",
    "is the conformal gauge , in which we impose | ( , ) | ^ 2 + | ( , ) |^2 & = & 1[eqn : xpxd ] +  ( , ) ( , ) & = & 0 where we have fixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and primes and dots denote differentiation with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . .",
    "with these conditions the equations of motion become  ( , ) =( , ) .",
    "the general solution is [ eqn : general ] ( , ) = ( ( - ) + ( + ) ) where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arbitrary functions constrained by the gauge conditions to satisfy @xmath10 . from eq .",

    "this means that there are points on the string that move at the speed of light and where the string doubles back on itself .",
    "( see fig.[fig : pseudo - cusp ] . )",
    "these events are called cusps@xcite .",
    "it is clear that this kind of dynamics falls outside of the domain of validity of the assumptions involved to obtain the nambu - goto action .",
    "nevertheless it has been shown by field theory simulations that the motion of the string is quite accurately described by the ng solution up to the point of interaction between the two branches of the string@xcite .",
    "the violent motion of the string at the cusps suggests the possibility of a range of effects which could have prospects of detection @xcite .    in 1985",
    "witten@xcite showed that certain particle physics models could lead to the formation of strings with superconducting behavior .",
    "it was soon realized that these models could in principle have a much richer phenomenology due to the inertia of the charge carriers and their coupling to the long - range electromagnetic field .",
    "in particular we can think that if the current on the string is not very large , then the string motion would not be affected , and calculate the electromagnetic radiation from a nambu - goto prescribed motion for the string .",
    "however , the power emitted by radiation near the cusp in this approximation is divergent due to the infinite lorentz factor of the ng cusp@xcite .",
    "this infinite result suggests that electromagnetic back - reaction is crucial in order to understand the superconducting string cusp .",
    "the short - range effects of the electromagnetic field can be taken into account by renormalization of the charge carrier inertia and charge@xcite .",
    "the charge carrier inertia term prevents the appearance of an infinite lorentz factor , and thus the calculation yields a finite result . in principle , this result could be further modified by back - reaction due to long - range fields ( i.e. radiation ) , but for generic values of the parameters we expect this correction to be small @xcite . further approximating that the current is chiral , at least in the vicinity of the cusp",
    ", we are able to do a proper calculation of the total power radiated .",
    "the equations of motion for a superconducting string can be written@xcite _ a ( ( ^ab + ^ab ) x^ _ , b ) & = & - f^ _ x^_,a j^a + _ a(^ab_,b ) & = & - 12 q ^ab f _ x^ _ , a x^ _ , b + _ f^ & = & - 4 j^ where @xmath0 is the energy per unit length of the string , @xmath14 the electromagnetic coupling of the fields on the string , @xmath15 the energy - momentum tensor of the charge carriers , [ eqn : fullthetadef ] ^ab = ^ac^bd_,c _ , d - 12 ^ab^cd _ , c _ , d , @xmath16 the auxiliary scalar field in terms of which we can express the conserved worldsheet current [ eqn : current ] j^a = q 1 ^ab _ , b , and @xmath17 the 4-dimensional current , [ eqn:4d - current ] j^(x ) = .",
    "these equations of motion are obtained from a two - dimensional effective action for the superconducting string and they are valid as long the current , measured in an invariant way , is not too large , j_a j^a |j_crit|^2 , where @xmath18 is the limiting current at which charge carriers can be ejected .    the leading effect of electromagnetic self - interaction of the current - carrying string can be taken into account by a redefinition of the auxiliary field @xmath16 and its charge@xcite .",
    "this enables us to include the near - field effect on the left - hand side of the equations of motion .",
    "if we take this as our only back - reaction effect , then we can rewrite the equations above in a much simpler way by taking @xmath14 and @xmath16 to be the renormalized quantities , to get _ a ( ( ^ab + ^ab ) x^ _ , b ) & = & 0 + _",
    "a(^ab _ , b ) & = & 0 + [ eqn : renorm - equation-3 ] _ f^ & = & - 4 j^    this procedure decouples the first two equations from the third one , and they now give the motion of a ` neutral ' superconducting string . in the last equation , @xmath19 is the external field emitted by the current moving according to the first two equations .",
    "numerical simulations@xcite have suggested that as a superconducting cosmic string loop contracts under its own tension , it would approach the ` chiral ' limit , in which the current on the string is null , in other words , @xmath20 .",
    "this , in turn , means that the auxiliary scalar field fulfills the condition , [ eqn : chirality ] ^ab _ , b _ , a = 0 .    furthermore , it can be shown@xcite that if the current is not chiral it would become supercritical around the cusp and charge carriers would be ejected .",
    "we therefore expect that this process would drive this region of string around the cusp to the chiral limit .",
    "these arguments suggest that most of the electromagnetic radiation would come from chiral current carrying string cusps .",
    "if the current is chiral , the set of equations describing the string and the ` neutral ' current can be solved completely@xcite . in this case , the general solution for the scalar field is ( , ) = f ( + ) , where @xmath21 is an arbitrary function , and the string position is given by x^0 & = & + & = & 12[(- ) + ( + ) ] , with constraints for the otherwise arbitrary functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,    [ eqn : constraints ] ||^2 & = & 1 +     this description of the chiral strings makes evident that they behave very similarly to the nambu - goto case . as before , the functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 live on the surface of spheres ( if the current is constant ) , but now their radii are different for the two cases .",
    "this change , however , brings important consequences for the string motion . as the magnitude of the current increases , the average velocity of the loop decreases , arriving at the limiting stationary case when @xmath24 , the chiral vorton@xcite .",
    "this also means that the string can only reach a finite lorentz factor at the cusp - like regions , in contrast with the nambu - goto case .",
    "this effect can be easily understood in terms of the resistance of the charge carriers to being accelerated by the string tension .",

    "electromagnetic radiation from superconducting cosmic strings cusps has traditionally been considered a distinctive signature of superconducting string models . recently this interest has been revived by as possible connection with gamma ray bursts@xcite and ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the total energy output from a pure nambu - goto string cusp ( i.e. no back - reaction included ) yields an infinite result due to the infinite lorentz factor of the tip of the string , where the charge carriers get concentrated .",
    "it is therefore necessary to impose some sort of cutoff for this process .",
    "early calculations@xcite assumed the cutoff to be where the energy in the charge carriers was comparable with the energy of the string . this procedure gives a linear dependence of the total energy with the maximum lorentz factor .",
    "we redo this calculation in the context of a chiral current on the string .",
    "this is the most interesting case since loops are driven to chirality by charge carrier ejection@xcite , especially near the cusps@xcite .    the full system of equations for a superconducting string is very complicated .",
    "nevertheless in the case of a chiral current they are much simpler and can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "this allows us to compute the electromagnetic radiation from a chiral - current string trajectory taking into account in an exact way the back - reaction of the charge carriers on the string motion . in order to do this",
    "we closely follow the procedure described in spergel _",
    "et al._@xcite and we extract the dependence of the total energy on the maximum lorentz factor that the string has in the pseudo - cusp region .",
    "we found the same linear dependence in the maximum lorentz factor as earlier estimates .",
    "this suggests that the intuitive picture of thinking about the back - reaction of the charge carriers as a process that only becomes important when their energy density is comparable to the energy of the string is correct , making it possible to extend this result to all types of currents .    in the case of cusps",
    "where the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 are nearly parallel or antiparallel , the radiation can be much larger than in the generic case . for small currents ,",
    "the radiation from such cusps dominates in the total flux , but only by a logarithmic factor .",
