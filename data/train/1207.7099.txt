    "<S> purpose : :    define and evaluate an approximation scheme that can be used to study    nuclei that are described as two particles attached to a closed    ( sub-)shell nucleus . methods : :    the equation - of - motion coupled - cluster formalism has been used to    obtain ground and excited state energies . this method is based on the    diagonalization of a non - hermitian matrix obtained from a similarity    transformation of the many - body nuclear hamiltonian . a chiral    interaction at the next - to - next - to - next - to leading    order  ( n@xmath0lo ) using a cutoff at @xmath1  mev    was used . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the ground state energies of @xmath2li and    @xmath2he were in good agreement with a no - core shell - model    calculation using the same interaction . </S>",
    "<S> several excited states were    also produced with overall good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> only the    @xmath3 excited state in @xmath2li showed a    sizable deviation . </S>",

    "<S> the calculated spectra were converged and    comparable to both experiment and shell - model studies in this region .    </S>",
    "<S> some excited states in @xmath4o were high or missing in    the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it was also shown that the wave function for both ground    and excited states separates into an intrinsic part and a gaussian for    the center - of - mass coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> spurious center - of - mass excitations are    clearly identified . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    results are converged with respect to the size of the model space and    the method can be used to describe nuclear states with simple    structure . </S>",
    "<S> especially the ground state energies were very close to    what has been achieved by exact diagonalization . to obtain a closer    match with experimental data , effects of three - nucleon forces , the    scattering continuum as well as additional configurations in the    coupled - cluster approximations , are necessary . </S>"
