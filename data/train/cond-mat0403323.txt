    "transport of strongly interacting fermions in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems have been so far the subject of numerous theoretical as well as some experimental studies @xcite .",
    "while the ground - state and low - temperature properties , following the luttinger - liquid universality , are well understood , the transport properties still lack some fundamental understanding regarding the role of fermion correlations .",
    "it has become evident in recent years , that with respect to transport ( in contrast to static quantities ) integrable many - fermion models behave very differently from nonintegrable ones @xcite .",
    "some basic 1d fermion models are integrable , as the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( equivalent to the anisotropic heisenberg spin model ) and the hubbard model , and reveal in the metallic regime dissipationless transport at finite temperature @xmath2 , well founded due to the relation to conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "the transport in the insulating regime of integrable models , however , has been controvertial and is the issue of this paper .",
    "let us concentrate on the dynamical conductivity in 1d system @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ( total ) particle current operator , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the number of sites in the chain ( we set everywhere @xmath7 as well as lattice spacing @xmath8 ) . at finite @xmath9 the charge stiffness ( referred to also as drude weight ) @xmath10 measures the dissipationless component in the response , while @xmath11 is the regular part .",
    "the requirement that the ground state is insulating @xcite is @xmath12 . in the insulating regime",
    "there are still several alternative scenarios for the behavior at finite temperatures .",
    "the system can at @xmath2 behave as : a ) an ideal conductor with @xmath13 , b ) a normal resistor with @xmath14 but @xmath15 , and c ) an ideal insulator with @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "a well - known @xmath17 insulator is the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at half filling and @xmath18 .",
    "the model is equivalent in this regime to an easy - axis anisotropic xxz heisenberg model with @xmath19 .",
    "it has been shown by one of the present authors @xcite that @xmath20 is finite for @xmath21 but decreasing towards @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "this gives a strong indication that @xmath14 in the whole regime @xmath18 , although there are also alternative interpretations @xcite .",
    "the present authors speculated in this case on a possible realisation of an ideal insulator @xcite where also @xmath24 .",
    "the argument is based on the observation that at least in the @xmath25 limit the soliton - antisoliton mapping can be applied , where the eigenstates can not carry any current . however , the issue proved to be more involved .",
    "note that the transport of gapped spin systems described by the quantum nonlinear sigma model , when treated by a semiclassical approach @xcite ( mapping to a model of classical impenetrable particles ) indicates a normal conductor with a finite diffusion constant and @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", a bethe ansatz approach @xcite concludes to a finite drude weight @xmath27 and thus ballistic transport .",
    "it should be reminded that the @xmath23 case , corresponding to the most studied isotropic heisenberg model , is marginal situation , with the long - standing open question whether the diffusion constant ( studied mostly at @xmath28 ) in this model is finite @xcite .",
    "another prominent @xmath17 insulator is the hubbard model at half filling . here",
    "even the question of @xmath20 is controvertial . on the basis of bethe ansatz results @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite",
    "it is claimed that @xmath27 , i.e. an ideal conductor situation .",
    "more recent analytical considerations @xcite seem to favor @xmath14 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present numerical evidence that the dynamical conductivity @xmath29 in the insulating regime of several integrable 1d models is indeed very anomalous .",
    "we consider in this context three 1d models : the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , the hubbard model and a related model of impenetrable particles .",
    "first , finite - size scaling of results for all mentioned models indicates that indeed @xmath22 ( whereby the evidence is somewhat less conclusive for the hubbard model ) .",
    "moreover , we show that on the one hand small - system results reveal large pseudogap features in @xmath30 and large finite size effects extending to high frequencies ; on the other hand , after the finite - size scaling in the thermodynamic limit is performed , the results could be consistent with a normal and featureless @xmath29 found by a frequency - moment analysis . in this respect",
    "the behavior is very different from the one in nonintegrable quantum many - body models where even in small - size systems a normal diffusive behavior is very evident @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present two alternative numerical methods used to analyse the dynamical conductivity @xmath29 : the microcanonical lanczos method and the method of frequency moments . in sec .",
    "iii results for three different 1d models in the insulating regime are presented and discussed : the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at half - filling , the hubbard model at half - filling and the model of impenetrable particles .",
    "microscopic models considered in this paper are 1d tight - binding models with the hopping only among nearest neighbors .",
    "we investigate within these models the dynamical charge conductivity @xmath29 ( in the case of impenetrable particles the related spin conductivity @xmath31 ) at @xmath32 with an emphasis on the low @xmath33 behavior .",
    "the first approach we apply is the full exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the hamiltonian on a lattice with @xmath6 sites and periodic boundary conditions ( p.b.c . ) taking into account the number of fermions @xmath34 and the wavevector @xmath35 as good quantum numbers .",
    "e.g. , this allows for an exact solution of @xmath29 up to @xmath36 for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "larger systems can be studied using the lanczos method of ed .    particularly appropriate at large enough",
    "@xmath9 is the microcanonical lanczos method ( mclm ) @xcite .",
    "the mclm uses the idea that dynamical autocorrelations ( in a large enough system ) can be evaluated with respect to a single wavefunction @xmath37 provided that the energy deviation @xmath38 is small enough .",
    "clearly , @xmath39 determines here the temperature @xmath9 for which @xmath37 is a relevant representative .",
    "such @xmath37 can be generated via a first lanczos procedure using instead of @xmath40 a modified projection operator @xmath41 , performing @xmath42 lanczos steps to get the ground state of @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamical correlations are then calculated using the standard lanczos procedure for dynamical autocorrelation functions , where the modified @xmath44 is the starting wavefunction for the second lanczos iteration with @xmath45 steps generating the continued fraction representation of @xmath29 .",
    "the main advantage of the mclm is that it can reach systems equivalent in size to the usual ground - state calculations using the lanczos method . for details",
    "we refer to ref.[17 ] ; e.g. , the largest available size for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is thus @xmath46 .    besides the @xmath29 spectra it is instructive to also show the normalized integrated intensity @xmath47 . in tight - binding models with n.n . hopping the ( optical ) sum rule for @xmath29",
    "is given by @xmath48 where @xmath9 is the kinetic term in the hamiltonian .",
    "hence @xmath47 can be expressed as @xmath49 which is monotonously increasing function with the limiting value @xmath50 and well defined even for small systems . here",
    ", @xmath51 .",
    "it should be noted that in a full ed calculation the drude part @xmath52 appears strictly at @xmath53 , eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , while in the mclm it spreads into a window @xmath54 governed by the number of lanczos steps @xmath42 .",
    "still , choosing large enough @xmath55 , @xmath56 becomes very small , hence we get well resolvable drude contribution .",
    "typically we use in the calculations presented here @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in order to get smooth spectra especially for small system sizes",
    ", we additionally performed an averaging over @xmath59 different @xmath39 with respect to the normal gaussian distribution .",
    "typically , we used @xmath60 for smallest @xmath6 and @xmath61 for largest @xmath6 presented in figures below .",
    "as will be evident from results furtheron @xmath29 exhibits huge finite - size effects .",
    "the latter are clearly a consequence of the integrability since nonintegrable models do not exhibit such features . in order to avoid such finite - size phenomena we also perform an alternative analysis using the method of frequency moments ( fm ) .",
    "it is well known that at @xmath62 one can calculate for @xmath29 exact frequency moments @xmath63 as @xmath64\\cdots ] j)/{\\rm tr}(1 ) .",
    "\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] moments correspond here to an infinite system @xmath65 and could be evaluated at fixed fermion concentration @xmath66 using the linked cluster expansion and the diagrammatic representation @xcite .",
    "only clusters containing up to @xmath67 particles can contribute to @xmath68 in an infinite system for models with n.n .",
    "connections only .",
    "however , an analytic calculation of moments for larger @xmath69 becomes very tedious .",
    "hence we use the fact that _ exact moments for an infinite system _ can be obtained also via the ed results for small - system ( with p.b.c . )",
    "@xcite provided that the system size @xmath6 is large enough .",
    "i.e. , @xmath70 refer to eigenstates for @xmath34 fermions . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) @xmath71 and fugacity @xmath72 can be related to the density @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the number of states for given @xmath34 .",
    "let us illustrate the feasibility of fm method for the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model . performing full ed for all fillings @xmath75 on a ring we get exactly fm up to @xmath76 whereby even higher @xmath77 moments are quite accurate .",
    "using full ed for @xmath36 we thus reach for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model exactly up to @xmath78 .",
    "next step is to reconstruct spectra @xmath29 from @xmath68 with @xmath79 .",
    "there are various strategies how to get the spectra most representative for @xmath80 , expecting a smooth function @xmath29 .",
    "we follow here the procedure proposed by nickel @xcite .",
    "first , a nonlinear transformation @xmath81 is performed where @xmath82 is chosen as the largest eigenvalue in a truncated continued fraction representation of @xmath29 . for @xmath29 then a pad ' e approximant @xmath83 $ ] is found in terms of functions of the novel variable @xmath84 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that fm are less sensitive to the low-@xmath85 regime , so a possible price to pay is an uncertainty in the low frequency results . in this respect mclm and",
    "fm results really yield an alternative view of low-@xmath85 dynamics .",
    "let us first analyse the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model for interacting spinless fermions , @xmath86 with the repulsion @xmath1 between fermions on n.n .",
    "sites and the corresponding current operator @xmath87 at half - filling , i.e. , at the fermion density @xmath88 , the ground state is metallic for @xmath21 and insulating for @xmath18 . note that by introducing a fictitious magnetic flux via the substitution @xmath89 the model turns into the anisotropic xxz heisenberg model for @xmath90 and even number of fermions .    in the following we present",
    "only results in the limit @xmath28 . from eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) it follows that @xmath91 scales in this limit as @xmath92 , hence we present in fig .",
    "1a @xmath93 , calculated for even number of fermions for @xmath94 and various sizes @xmath95 .",
    "results for @xmath96 are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "1b and reveal an exponential decrease with @xmath6 , which is at the same time a challenging test for the feasibility and the sensitivity of the mclm at larger sizes @xmath6 .    from results in figs .",
    "1a , b several observations follow : a ) the dissipationless component @xmath52 becomes negligible at large @xmath6 and the extrapolated value for @xmath97 is consistent with @xmath98   @xcite , b ) there is a pseudogap at low @xmath85 followed by a pronounced peak at @xmath99 and damped oscillatory features at @xmath100 , almost up to the bandwidth @xmath101 , c ) the peak and accompanied oscillations move downward with the system size approximately as @xmath102 , d ) the pseudogap in @xmath103 is compensated by the peak intensity as evident from the integrated @xmath47 which is essentially independent of @xmath6 for @xmath104 , e ) @xmath105 could approach @xmath106 for large @xmath6 , indicative of a normal d.c .",
    "conductivity @xmath107 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when applying the fm method to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model we get @xmath108 using full ed for @xmath36 we reach exactly up to @xmath78 . in figs .",
    "1a.b we diplay results for @xmath29 obtained via the fm using @xmath109 and the corresponding [ 4/5 ] pad ' e approximant .",
    "the fm method proves to be very stable in particular with respect to the most interesting and sensitive value @xmath107 .",
    "namely the latter varies only slightly between , e.g. , [ 3/3 ] and [ 4/5 ] pad ' e approximant .",
    "results confirm the overall agreement of mclm and fm - method spectra apart from evident finite - size phenomena at @xmath110 .",
    "it should be , however , mentioned that there are still some nonessential differences between @xmath47 results even at higher @xmath100 since the mclm results are for fixed fermion number @xmath111 whereas the fm corresponds to a grandcanonical averaging over all @xmath34 so that even lowest moments differ slightly .",
    "the general conclusion of the fm approach is that it does not show any sign of pseudogap features and thus favors quite featureless @xmath29 with finite @xmath107 .",
    "essentially the same results are reproduced for @xmath29 analysing fm using the maximum - entropy method @xcite .",
    "next let us consider the 1d hubbard model @xmath112 where we take into account a possible fictitious flux @xmath113 .",
    "we study the model at half filling @xmath114 where the ground state is insulating , i.e. @xmath115 , for all @xmath116 . in the limit",
    "@xmath117 the behavior should not depend on @xmath113 .",
    "nevertheless in small systems low-@xmath85 features , in particular @xmath118 , depend on @xmath113 .",
    "we present here calculations within the hubbard model using the ed and the mclm at @xmath119 since in this case @xmath120 is at maximum .",
    "relative to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , smaller sizes are reachable for the hubbard model at @xmath121 , i.e. , we investigate @xmath122 performing full ed , while with the mclm systems up to @xmath123 can be studied .",
    "results for the intermediate case @xmath124 and again @xmath125 are shown in figs .",
    "we note that several features are similar to results for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model : a ) @xmath52 decreases with @xmath6 , b ) a pseudogap appears for @xmath110 , c ) large finite size effects extend up to frequencies of the order of the bandwidth , d ) the pseudogap scale appears to close with the increasing system size .    however , the dependence of @xmath126 is not exponential , but the scaling appears to follow @xmath127 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "although with less certainty than within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model we could again support the limiting value @xmath14 . also , @xmath47 tends with increasing @xmath6 to @xmath128 for @xmath129 , here approaching from higher values in contrast to fig .",
    "1b . in spite of differences to the @xmath0-@xmath1 model",
    ", results scaled to the thermodynamic limit could be consistent with a smooth @xmath29 and a finite @xmath107 .",
    "we also perform the fm analysis , using exact ed results for systems with up to @xmath122 and @xmath130 . here , we use @xmath131 the analysis is accurate up to @xmath132 and corresponding [ 3/2 ] pad ' e approximants .",
    "this is barely enough to reproduce gross features of limiting @xmath29 , nevertheless results are in agreement with previous conclusions for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the above results indicate that integrable models in the insulating regime share similar features in the dynamical conductivity @xmath29 .",
    "it has already been proposed @xcite that it is helpful to consider the large interaction limit , i.e. , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where the dynamics of both models is simplified but remains highly nontrivial . for a half - filled band in this limit we are dealing with an excitation spectrum composed of split subspaces with a fixed number @xmath135 of oppositely charged  soliton - antisoliton \" ( @xmath136 ) pairs .",
    "in such a limit , the solitons / antisolitons - doubly occupied / empty sites in the hubbard model , occupied / empty n.n .",
    "sites in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model - behave as impenetrable quantum particles , since their crossing would require virtual processes with @xmath137 .    the simplest prototype model which incorporates the same physics - that of a system with two species of impenetrable particles - is the 1d @xmath0-model , @xmath138 where projected fermion operators take into account that the double occupation of sites is forbidden ; the two species of particles are represented by the up / down spin fermions .",
    "thus we consider within the @xmath0-model the spin current @xmath139 and the corresponding spin diffusivity @xmath31 .",
    "the only relevant parameter within the @xmath0-model is the electron density @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and of interest is the paramagnetic case @xmath142 .",
    "the model ( [ eq6 ] ) is also exactly solvable .",
    "moreover , the electron current @xmath4 commutes with @xmath40 , while the spin current @xmath143 does not .",
    "it is plausible that in an unpolarized ring , @xmath144 , exact eigenstates do not carry any spin current , i.e. , @xmath145 , and hence @xmath146 .",
    "this becomes clear by introducing the fictitious flux by @xmath89 .",
    "particles can not cross , so all eigenergies @xmath147 are independent of @xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath10 can be related @xcite to @xmath148 this leads to @xmath146 .",
    "still , this does not preclude @xmath149 , since @xmath150 in general .",
    "we study @xmath31 within the @xmath0-model again using the same methods . with the full ed",
    "we reach @xmath151 while with the mclm up to @xmath36 sites . for the presentation",
    "we choose the quarter - filled case , @xmath88 , where most systems are available , @xmath152 .",
    "results are shown in figs .",
    "3a , b . as expected ,",
    "finite - size features are very similar to those in figs .  1,2 , apart from @xmath153 .",
    "the pseudogap is pronounced even more clearly , with the peak frequency @xmath154 .",
    "particularly powerful for this model is the fm method .",
    "namely , from the full ed results we can evaluate exactly moments up to @xmath155 . since there is a single characteristic scale @xmath0 ,",
    "the structure of @xmath31 is simpler and better reproducible via the fm method .",
    "results corresponding to [ 5/5 ] pad ' e approximant are presented in figs .",
    "3a , b and again indicate on a normal diffusivity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us summarize and comment obtained results .",
    "we have shown that all considered 1d integrable models of interacting fermions share several common features :    \\a ) the charge stiffness is either @xmath153 ( @xmath0-model ) or appears to scale to zero , whereby the evidence is stronger for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . whereas the vanishing @xmath52 is easy to understand for impenetrable particles , it is a highly nontrivial statement for the other two models @xcite .",
    "the observations can be rationalized in a way that the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard model at half - filling in the thermodynamic limit @xmath65 remain to behave as in the limit @xmath156 where solitons and antisolitons can not cross .",
    "\\c ) the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit could be compatible with a rather featureless and regular @xmath157 and thus finite @xmath107 . with respect to the last two points the ed ( including mclm ) and fm methods are complementary .",
    "whereas the fm method ( valid for an @xmath117 system ) can not detect finite - size effects and appears to converge to a featureless @xmath29 , the ed methods are evidently sensitive to the effect of p.b.c . at finite @xmath6 .    a fundamental question raised by these observations",
    "is , whether the large finite size effects observed at low frequencies are reflected to the dynamics of bulk systems and in particular , which features of the conductivity ( e.g. @xmath35,@xmath85 -dependence ) might be singular .",
    "we restricted our results to @xmath158 .",
    "the latter is clearly most convenient for the fm method .",
    "nevertheless , from the mclm results considered at finite but high @xmath9 there appears no evidence for any qualitative change on behavior .",
    "we also presented results for a single parameter for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and hubbard model , and one filling for the @xmath0 model , respectively .",
    "one can not expect any essential difference for other values within the insulating regime , although numerical evidence becomes poorer , e.g. , on approaching @xmath159 within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model . clearly , the most challenging case is @xmath160 , corresponding to the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "our results reveal an increase of @xmath107 on approaching @xmath160 .",
    "still we are not able to settle the well - known dilemma @xcite whether @xmath107 remains finite or diverges in this marginal case .        for a review see _ interacting electrons in low dimensions",
