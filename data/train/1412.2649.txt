    "<S> to compute the mean perimeter of the convex hull of the walk of duration @xmath1 , we follow the general set - up developed in refs .  @xcite . by adapting cauchy s formula  @xcite for the perimeter of closed convex curves to random curves , it was shown that the mean perimeter of the convex hull of any two dimensional stochastic process , including that of a brownian motion , can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the maximal projection of the trajectory of the walker up to time @xmath1 in the direction @xmath0 . as in 1d , it is useful to express the mean in terms of the cumulative distribution of @xmath45 @xmath46 where the cumulative distribution @xmath47 can be identified to the survival probability up to time @xmath1 of the walker in the semi - infinite plane , but bounded additionally by an absorbing infinite wall at distance @xmath48 from the starting point , perpendicular to the direction @xmath0 ( see inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it then defines an infinite wedge of top angle @xmath49 with one absorbing edge and one reflecting edge . </S>",
    "<S> however , by adding a twin wedge symmetrically around the reflecting edge , the survival probability of the walker in the original wedge is the same as in the ` doubled ' wedge with twice the top angle @xmath50 , but with two absorbing edges . </S>",
    "<S> the survival probability of a brownian walker , starting initially at the polar coordinates @xmath51 , inside a wedge of angle @xmath52 with two absorbing edges is  @xcite @xmath53\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the standard modified bessel function . </S>",

    "<S> integrating over @xmath0 in eq .   then provides our final result for the mean rescaled perimeter ( mrp ) @xmath60 with @xmath61 given explicitly in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the mrp is a function of only one parameter , the rescaled distance to the wall @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we show in @xcite that the mrp , given in eqs .   </S>",
    "<S> and for arbitrary @xmath5 , simplifies a great deal in the important case @xmath15 of a brownian motion starting from the reflecting wall ( or equivalently starting at any fixed distance but for large times ) into @xmath62 as a simple check , we recover , for @xmath63 ( i.e. , in the direction parallel to the reflecting wall ) , the result for the non - confined case . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the potential reflections on the wall do not affect the walk in the parallel direction . for @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> , outwards orthogonally to the wall , we recover the 1d result obtained above @xmath65 , which is higher than in the non - confined case . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the wall pushes the trajectories further in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is straightforward to obtain the mrp of the convex hull by integrating over the angle @xmath0 @xmath66 where @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the mrp for a walk starting from the reflecting wall still grows as @xmath68 , but the prefactor @xmath69 is lower than the non - confined value @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath14 increases from @xmath21 , the scaling function @xmath71 in , supplemented by , first decreases , achieves a minimum and then increases again before eventually saturating to the constant @xmath72 corresponding to the non - confined case ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ recap](b ) for a plot ) . </S>",
    "<S> this non - monotonic behavior can already be understood by analyzing the @xmath73 limit . from eq .  , one can show that for small @xmath14 ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the amplitude c@xmath76 has a complicated expression ( see @xcite ) , which is negative for all @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the leading order correction term in is non - analytic only for @xmath77 . using laplace s method , the integration over @xmath0 finally leads to @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> let us make a few remarks : ( i ) while , for any fixed @xmath0 , @xmath61 has a nonzero linear term in @xmath14 for small @xmath14 , the linear term disappears when integrated over @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) strikingly , the mrp is nonanalytic as @xmath11 ( contrary to the 1d case ) and ( iii ) it starts decreasing from a value at @xmath15 which is lower than its @xmath79 limit , so it must display a minimum , as confirmed in fig  [ recap](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of this surprising minimum can be qualitatively discussed by identifying the temporal regimes of a brownian motion starting at a distance @xmath8 from the reflecting wall : ( i ) at short times ( _ i.e. _ @xmath80 ) , the walker does not see the reflecting wall and the unconfined value of the mrp @xmath81 is recovered . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) after a time of order @xmath82 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath83 ) , the reflecting wall starts impacting the trajectory by progressively reducing the space effectively accessible to the brownian motion and thus decreasing the mrp . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) next , these reflected trajectories start contributing to the outwards part of the convex hull ( with respect to the plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effective repulsion is an antagonistic effect of the wall that turns out to increase the mrp . </S>",
    "<S> finally , contrary to the 1d case , the mrp displays a complex behavior with @xmath14 , involving a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this minimum is global , implying in particular that the mrp is not minimized when the brownian motion starts from the wall anymore , but for a nontrivial value of @xmath84 .     as a function of the rescaled distance @xmath14 for different values of @xmath0 . like the mean perimeter of the convex hull </S>",
    "<S> , this quantity displays a minimum with respect to @xmath14 for all directions except parallel or perpendicular to the wall . ]    insights on this minimum may further be gained by considering the mean span in direction @xmath0 given by involved in , whose small @xmath14 development is obtained by combining the two forms of . </S>",
    "<S> knowing that the mean span in direction @xmath0 at @xmath15 is lower than its large @xmath14 limit and that it starts decreasing ( @xmath85 ) , it displays a minimum for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ span ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> after integration over @xmath0 , the non - monotonicity remains .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied analytically the mean perimeter of the convex hull of a brownian motion in 1d and 2d in presence of a reflecting wall at the origin . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> , this confinement leads to a striking non - monotonic and non - analytic ( for small distances ) behavior of the mean perimeter as a function of the scaled starting distance from the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the non - monotonicity 2d originates from the competition between two antagonistic effects due to the presence of the wall : reduction of the space accessible to the brownian motion and effective repulsion . </S>",
