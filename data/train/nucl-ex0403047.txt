    "the phenix experiment has collected @xmath6 of dau collisions from the rhic 2003 run period .",
    "this provides the first opportunity to study the cold nuclear medium effects on particle production in dau collisions at @xmath3 .",
    "the observed suppression of high @xmath1 particles in central auau collisions and enhancement in dau collisions at central rapidity at rhic showed the nuclear medium plays an important role in particle production.@xcite in this paper , we extend our measurement of @xmath0 , defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , in dau collisions from central pseudo - rapidity @xmath7 to the forward and backward regions , @xmath2 .    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the average number of binary collisions of a given centrality . for high @xmath1 particles ,",
    "the production cross section is normally given by pqcd ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the parton distribution function of the incoming beam particle @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the fragmentation function and @xmath14 is the partonic cross section .",
    "nuclear modifications of the initial parton distributions , such as ( anti)shadowing@xcite , and variations in parton energy loss and multiple scattering could lead to a change in @xmath0 .",
    "it is also important to note that particles produced in dau collisions at large forward ( or backward ) rapidity are from partons with small ( or large ) @xmath15 in au nuclei , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the mass scale of the partonic process . without nuclear effects , the number of particles produced in hard scatterings would scale with the number of binary collisions and @xmath18 would be unity , independent of the rapidity and centrality .",
    "thus @xmath0 provides a good experimental tool to study non - trivial nuclear effects in heavy ion collisions .",
    "our current understanding of nuclear effects at large rapidity in high energy heavy ion collisions is very limited both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "several existing models give quite different predictions@xcite on particle production at large rapidity - from strong enhancement to strong suppression .    besides the difference in the initial state @xmath15 values , it is also important to realize that in d - au collisions at rhic , particles detected in the forward and backward directions by the phenix muon detector in the cm frame ( lab frame at rhic ) have very different kinematics in the au rest frame ( from @xmath19gev , backward , to @xmath20gev , forward ) thus the interactions of the produced particles with the ( cold ) au nuclear medium , right after the hard scattering , could be very different in these two kinematic regions@xcite .",
    "understanding such effects is important to allow disentanglement of initial and final state effects in auau collisions .",
    "the two phenix muon spectrometers cover the pseudo - rapidity ranges @xmath21 and @xmath22 with excellent momentum resolution and muon identification@xcite . in front of each muon spectrometer , there is a @xmath23 ( nuclear interaction length ) thick nose cone absorber that is about @xmath24 cm away from the central collision point .",
    "the excellent capability for muon measurement has already been demonstrated in recently published @xmath25 measurements@xcite .",
    "here we discuss the novel techniques we developed recently to extend the capability of the muon spectrometers to include hadron measurements at large rapidity .",
    "a hadron can decay into a muon before the nose cone absorber , the muon is then measured by the muon spectrometer .",
    "this method is widely used in high energy experiments to measure heavy flavor production through their ( semi)leptonic decays .",
    "we extend this method to measure light meson decays , such as @xmath26 . in phenix , due to the finite distance from the collision vertex to the nose cone absorber , charged pions and kaons from the collisions have a chance to decay before they reach the absorber , with the decay probability @xmath27 given by ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the distance to the absorber ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the momentum , mass and proper lifetime of the particle .",
    "thus , collisions that occurred far from the absorber will be more likely to have muons from light meson decays than those that happened close to the absorber .",
    "shows the normalized collision vertex distribution from events with forward muons in dau collisions .",
    "the large slope indicates a significant fraction of muons are from pion and kaon decays . by studying the event collision vertex distribution , muons from light meson decays",
    "are extracted statistically . for heavy hadrons , due to their very short proper decay lengths , @xmath33 , the collision vertex dependence is minimal .",
    "momentum distributions of tracks stopped at various muid absorber layers .",
    ", width=226,height=151 ]    momentum distributions of tracks stopped at various muid absorber layers .",
    ", width=245,height=151 ]    in addition to muons from hadron decays , about @xmath34 of hadrons from the collisions can punch through the first nose cone absorber , sail through the muon tracking system and finally be absorbed inside the muon identification system .",
    "shows the momentum distributions of tracks stopped in the gap-2 and gap-3 muid absorber layers .",
    "the sharp peaks near @xmath35gev are due to stopped low energy muons , as they lose all of their energy by ionization in the absorber . in the high momentum region , @xmath36gev ,",
    "most of the tracks are stopped hadrons .",
    "a detailed mc simulation shows that a momentum cut @xmath36gev can reject most of the soft muons and yield about @xmath37 pure hadrons in the sample .",
    "hadrons measured with the methods described above are used to study the centrality and rapidity dependence of @xmath0 . in the first case ,",
    "most of the muons are from an about equal mixture of charged pion and kaon decays ; in the second case , the tagged hadrons are from a mixture of mesons and baryons , with relative fractions modulated by their nuclear interactions with the nose cone absorbers .",
    "minimum @xmath38gev and @xmath39gev cuts are used in the above analyses to reject soft processes , respectively .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the centrality dependent @xmath0 measured with muons from light meson decays and punch - through hadrons .",
    "the reference peripheral bin is from @xmath5 centrality collisions .",
    "@xmath0 results are shown in @xmath4 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 centrality bins .",
    "the dominant errors are from statistics and the uncertainties in the determination of the number of binary collisions @xmath9 in a given centrality bin , which is shown as a block error bar in each plot at @xmath42 .",
    "we have observed a suppression in very central collisions relative to the peripheral one in the forward rapidity , and an enhancement in the backward rapidity . for a typical @xmath43gev hadron",
    ", the @xmath15 value probed in au at the very forward rapidity @xmath44 is estimated as @xmath45 ; at the very backward rapidity @xmath46 , @xmath47 .     from punch - through hadrons.,width=321,height=238 ]     from punch - through hadrons.,width=264,height=226 ]",
    "we have presented @xmath0 measurements with hadrons in the forward and backward rapidities in dau collisions at rhic .",
    "brahms experiment has also reported similar results at forward rapidity in this conference.@xcite the preliminary results seem qualitatively consistent with parton shadowing / saturation picture in small @xmath15 and antishadowing / cronin effect in large @xmath15 inside the au nucleus .",
    "it will be very interesting to see what happens to drell - yan and open charm @xmath0 as we have observed a very similar effect in @xmath48 production in d - au collisions.@xcite in addition to @xmath0 , measurements of @xmath49 ( which is normalized with pp data rather than peripheral dau data ) will be important to completely understand the absolute nuclear effects , such as suppression and enhancement , since the most peripheral @xmath5 bin used to calculate @xmath0 in this analysis could still be significantly different from a minimum bias @xmath50 reference .",
