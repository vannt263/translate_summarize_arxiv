    "tidal interactions play an important role in dynamical processes in the two - body problem in close binary systems : star  star ( binary star ) or star planet .",
    "they can lead to such phenomena as synchronization and orbital circularization ( hut 1981 ; zahn 1977 ) as well as to the tidal capture ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) or disruption of an object ( star ) ( ivanov and novikov 2001 ) and the fall of the object onto the star ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 ; penev et al . 2012 ; bolmont and mathis 2016 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the tidal interaction of two bodies : a star and a point source .",
    "the point source can be both a star ( a neutron star , a white dwarf , etc . ) and a planet .",
    "below we will call the point source a planet by implying that this can also be a star .",
    "since the evolution time scales of the eccentricity or semimajor axis strongly depend on the orbital period of the binary system and for some stellar models can take values up to 108 yr or more for periods of about 5 days ( ivanov et al . 2013 ; chernov et al . 2013 ) , the evolution of the star itself should be taken into account on such time scales .",
    "as the star evolves , the orbital parameters change due to tidal interactions . in this paper",
    "we investigate the dynamical tides by taking into account the stellar evolution . for our study",
    "we chose three types of stars with masses of one , one and a half , and two solar masses .",
    "we consider all stars without allowance for their rotation and magnetic field and touch on the stellar physics itself superficially , as far as this problem requires .",
    "the star of one solar mass at lifetimes @xmath3 yr closely corresponds to our sun and has a radiative core and a convective envelope on the main sequence .",
    "the other two stars of one and a half and two solar masses are more massive and have a more complex structure .",
    "these stars have a convective core and a radiative envelope on the main sequence ( a more precise structure is presented below ) .",
    "the problem of determining the tidal evolution is reduced to the problem of determining the normal modes of stellar perturbations and to calculating the energy and angular momentum exchange in the star.planet system ( ivanov and papaloizou 2004 , 2010 ; papaloizou and ivanov 2010 ; lanza and mathis 2016 ) .",
    "the low - frequency g - modes of the stellar oscillations play an important role in the theory of dynamical tides .",
    "the tidal interactions are fairly intense at small periastron distances of the planet . for a periastron distance @xmath4 au , the dimensionless excitation frequency is @xmath5 , which corresponds to g - modes .",
    "a large number of exoplanets in stellar systems have been discovered in the last few years owing to the kepler , superwasp , and other observational programs . in particular ,",
    "short - period massive planets with an orbital period of a few days , the so - called hot jupiters , have been detected ( winn 2015 ) . as a rule ,",
    "the hot jupiters have low eccentricities , which points to the importance of tidal interactions ( ogilvie 2014 ) .",
    "the results of this paper can be directly applied to some of such systems .",
    "for example , the system ybp1194 is a solar twin ( brucalassi et al .",
    "a planet with a mass of 0.34@xmath6 and a period of only 6.9 days revolves around this star .",
    "for such a short - period planet the dynamical tides must be fairly intense and must affect the orbital evolution .",
    "predictions about the subsequent evolution of this planet can be made by analyzing this system .",
    "one of the results of this evolution is the fall of the planet onto the star .",
    "the possibility of such a fall has been considered in many papers ( see , e.g. , rasio et al .",
    "1996 ; penev et al . 2012",
    "; weinberg et al . 2012 ; essick and weinberg 2016 ) . rasio et al .",
    "( 1996 ) considered the possibility of the fall of the planet onto the star due to quasi - static tides and provided a plot for solar - like stars that shows the threshold , as a function of planetary mass and orbital period , below which the planet falls onto the star .",
    "penev et al .",
    "( 2012 ) considered tides with a constant tidal quality factor @xmath7 specified phenomenologically . in reality , this factor will depend on the planet s orbital period ( ivanov et al .",
    "2013 ) and stellar age .",
    "essick and weinberg ( 2016 ) took into account the energy dissipation due to nonlinear interaction of modes with one another .",
    "in contrast to our approach ( ivanov et al .",
    "2013 ; chernov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the simultaneous solution of a large number of ordinary differential equations for each stellar model is suggested , with only solar - type stars having been considered .",
    "in this paper we consider the evolution of stars with masses of one , one and a half , and two solar masses .",
    "data on the stars are presented in tables 1 3 .",
    "a novelty of this study is a consistent allowance for the stellar evolution . for each moment of the star",
    "s lifetime we calculated the spectra of normal modes , the overlap integrals ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) , which are a measure of the intensity of tidal interactions ( for a generalization to the case of a rotating star , see papaloizou and ivanov 2005 ; ivanov and papaloizou 2007 ) , and the time scales of the orbital parameters ( the tidal quality factor @xmath7 ) .",
    "the overlap integrals are directly related to the tidal resonance coefficients that were introduced by cowling ( 1941 ) ( see also rocca 1987 ; zahn 1970 ) .",
    "all of the quantities marked by a tilde are dimensionless ; the normalization is presented in appendix a.",
    "such a quantity as the overlap integral q is of great importance in the theory of dynamical tides .",
    "it is specified by the expression ( press and teukolsky 1977 ; zahn 1970 ) @xmath8 where m is the stellar mass , r is the stellar radius , and @xmath9 is the dimensionless overlap integral ; the remaining quantities and their dimensionless forms are defined in appendix a. the overlap integral serves as a measure of the intensity of the tidal forces and plays a crucial role in the physics of dynamical tides ( press and teukolsky 1977 ; zahn 1970 , 1975 , 1977 ) . here",
    ", we will consider only the quadrupole part of the tidal forces @xmath10 , because it is this part that makes the greatest contribution to the overlap integral ( press and teukolsky 1977 ) .",
    "the change in orbital semimajor axis and eccentricity with time is determined from the energy and angularmomentum conservation laws and is specified by the following formulas ( ivanov et al .",
    "2013 ) : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath13 is the semimajor axis , and the time scales of the change in semimajor axis @xmath14 and eccentricity @xmath15 in the case of low eccentricities ( @xmath16 ) are specified by the relations ( ivanov et al .",

    "( 51 ) from ivanov et al .",
    "the spectrum is deemed to be dense enough if @xmath21 . for simplicity",
    ", we will consider here only the time scales of the changes in semimajor axis .",
    "using formulas from subsection 7.1 of the paper by ivanov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we obtain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ratio of the planetary mass to the stellar mass , @xmath24 is the difference between adjacent frequencies , @xmath25 is the frequency number , and @xmath26 ( ivanov et al .",

    "( [ overlapsintegral ] ) , the eigenfunctions and , accordingly , eigenfrequencies of the stellar oscillations should be known to calculate the overlap integral .",
    "there exist three types of eigenfrequencies for a nonrotating star : the so - called p- , f- , and g - modes .",
    "we will be concerned only with the low - frequency g- modes .",
    "the properties of the g - modes are determined by the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency .",
    "it is specified as follows ( christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 is the density , @xmath33 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath34 is the adiabatic index .",
    "however , this definition of the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency is difficult to apply to many stars .",
    "this is related to the numerical errors , to the calculation of the derivative of the density , and to the fact that there exist regions in stars where both terms in parentheses can be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , a different definition is used ( brassard et al . 1991 ) : @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 the temperature gradient @xmath37 @xmath38 is the mass fraction of atoms of type i , and @xmath39 it is convenient to divide the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency into two parts : the structural part ( structure terms ) brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the compositional part @xmath41 the compositional part is related to the change in stellar chemical composition due to nuclear reactions , and it is of great importance at the boundary of the convective and radiative regions .",
    "another important stellar characteristic is the acoustic frequency defined by the formula @xmath42    the low - frequency g - modes are excited at @xmath43 .",
    "the high - frequency p - modes are excited at @xmath44 .",
    "we will not consider the p - modes , because they play a secondary role in the theory of dynamical tides .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to finding the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies of the stellar oscillations , calculating the overlap integrals , and calculating the characteristic orbital parameters as a function of time .",
    "the equations that describe the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of a star in the adiabatic and cowling approximations are presented in appendix a. the stars were modeled with the mesa software package ( paxton et al .",

    "the dashed curve indicates the change in orbital period without allowance for the stellar evolution .",
    "the time scale of the orbital change was taken at the star s lifetime @xmath106 yr . as can be seen from fig .",
    "13 , the planet does not fall onto the star in the main - sequence lifetime of the star without allowance for its evolution .",
    "q        just as for the star of one and a half solar masses , the evolution time scales ( 3 ) of the planet decrease as the star begins to move off the main sequence .",
    "this is because the hydrogen reserves at the stellar center begin to be depleted , and the convective core becomes a helium one .",
    "this leads to an expansion of the star and , consequently , to an increase in the number of g - modes and the density of the spectrum , which leads to an increase in the pumping of orbital energy into the energy of stellar oscillations and to the fall of short - period planets onto the star .",
    "we considered the change in the orbital period of a planet around a star with a mass of one , one and a half , and two solar masses .",
    "the behavior of the overlap integrals for these models as a function of the main - sequence lifetime of the star was analyzed .",
    "we showed that for the same star with a different structure during its evolution the overlap integrals could differ by two or more orders of magnitude .",
    "we showed that all planets with a mass of one jupiter mass that revolve around the sun with an orbital period @xmath1 days or shorter should fall onto the stellar surface in the main - sequence lifetime of the star .",
    "all planets with a mass of one jupiter mass that revolve around the stars with a mass of one and a half and two solar masses with an orbital period @xmath2 or shorter will fall onto the stellar surface in the main - sequence lifetime of the star .",
    "such a fall may not occur without allowance for the evolution of the star itself .",
    "these results qualitatively agree with the previous results from bolmont and mathis ( 2016 ) and penev ( 2012 ) .",
    "calculations for the stellar models considered in this paper should be made for a more accurate quantitative estimate .",

    "the system of equations describing the adiabatic perturbations in stars is written in dimensionless form ( christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) : @xmath107 where the following dimensionless variables are introduced : @xmath108 is the radius , @xmath109 is the radial perturbation , @xmath110 is the horizontal perturbation , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the perturbations of the gravitational potential and its derivative , respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath113 refers to an unperturbed quantity , and the prime @xmath114 refers to a perturbed quantity .",
    "a tilde over a quantity means that this quantity is dimensionless .",
    "the normalization is done as follows : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the sound speed squared , @xmath31 is the pressure , @xmath32 is the density , and @xmath50 is the brunt - v@xmath28is@xmath29l@xmath29 frequency squared .",
    "four boundary conditions should be added to the four first - order differential equations .",
    "two boundary conditions are specified at the stellar center , and the other two are specified on the stellar surface ( christensen - dalsgaard 1998 ) .",
    "the boundary conditions at the stellar center @xmath117 are @xmath118 the boundary conditions on the stellar surface @xmath119 are @xmath120 there exists the cowling ( 1941 ) approximation , in which the perturbed gravitational potential is neglected , to investigate the low - frequency g - modes .",
    "this approximation holds good and simplifies considerably the system of equations for the adiabatic perturbations ( 14 ) . in the cowling approximation",
    "the system of equations ( 14 ) will be rewritten in a simpler form : @xmath121 in the cowling approximation the system of equations ( 18 ) ceases to depend explicitly on the stellar density .",
    "thus , in the low - frequency limit the radial and horizontal displacements do not depend on the stellar density .",
    "in contrast , the overlap integrals ( 1 ) directly depend on the density . in the cowling approximation not four but two",
    "boundary conditions should be added to the system of equations ( 18 ) .",
    "one boundary condition is specified at the stellar center , and the other one is specified on the stellar surface .",
    "the boundary condition at the stellar center @xmath117 is @xmath122 the boundary condition on the stellar surface @xmath123 is @xmath124 to determine the eigenfrequency spectrum of the system of equations ( 14 ) or ( 18 ) , this system should be redefined .",
    "this requires that the determinant composed of the eigenfunctions of the system of equations ( 14 ) or ( 18 ) be equal to zero .",
    "this will hold only for some frequencies ( eigenfrequencies ) of the system of equations ( 14 ) or ( 18 ) , which determines the perturbation spectrum .",
    "the tables present the models for which the overlap integrals ( 1 ) and the evolution time scales of the orbital parameters ( 2 ) were calculated .",
    "the notation is as follows : @xmath125 is the time in years , @xmath126 is the radius measured in solar radii , @xmath127 is the luminosity measured in solar luminosities , @xmath128 is effective surface temperature measured in kelvins , h1 is the hydrogen mass fraction at the stellar center , and @xmath129 is the mean stellar density measured in @xmath130 ."
