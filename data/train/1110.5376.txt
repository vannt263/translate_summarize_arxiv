    "the neo - darwinian synthesis brought population genetics into the heart of evolutionary biology  @xcite , something that has since been crystallized in the vast array of sophisticated models , which incorporate factors like stochasticity , spatial structure , and epistasis  @xcite . despite this and the widespread acceptance of the population genetics as the cornerstone of the evolutionary theory ,",
    "the low ratio of empiricism to modeling has long been noted in the literature  @xcite .",
    "although genomics studies can be a very useful for testing qualitative predictions of population genetics , e.g. the importance of effective population size for purifying selection  @xcite , a controlled experiment in the laboratory is better suited for the specific goal of validating the theory .",
    "one of the key barriers to quantitative tests is that many theories of population genetics consider well - mixed populations , i.e. populations without spatial structure .",
    "the assumption of a lack of structure can often be a drastic approximation .",
    "moreover , the ever - growing number of theories that do incorporate spatial structure  @xcite presents a new set of problems because empirical tests require the knowledge of certain demographic parameters , such as dispersal rates , for which little data are typically available  @xcite . an open challenge for population genetics , therefore , is to develop new empirical methods and tests of the theories themselves , and , in particular , quantitative tests that can rigorously verify models of spatially structured populations .",
    "we focus on neutral population genetics theory of effectively one - dimensional populations applied to range expansions .",
    "the importance of spatial separation for the development of genetic diversity was first emphasized by  @xcite and was further developed by  @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "in addition to stationary populations , malcot s analysis also describes populations undergoing range expansions as was shown in @xcite . while the theory is in principle general to a range expansion of any species , we focus here on one of the most tractable of experimental systems , the colony biofilms formed by bacteria on solid surfaces  @xcite .",
    "microbial populations are often used to elucidate the mechanisms of evolution because of their short generation times and the ease of genetic manipulation  @xcite . with a few exceptions",
    "@xcite , the homogeneous environment of a chemostat or a vigorously shaken test tube is preferred because of its simplicity and the ease of comparison to mathematical models , which are often intractable for populations with spatial structure . however , even for microbes , it is now clear that most natural populations are not well - mixed , and the neighborhood of any individual is enriched in the individuals that are ancestrally related to it .",
    "this is especially true for many bacteria commonly forming dense surface - attached communities known as biofilms  @xcite .",
    "these resilient microbial communities are found in numerous contexts , both medical and industrial , and are often highly resistant to antibiotics .",
    "for this reason , there is now a large body of literature on biofilm formation , which underlines their complexity with major differences in the regulation and development of biofilms among strains and species  @xcite .",
    "key factors affecting the structure of biofilms include physical interactions among cells , the diffusivity of metabolites  @xcite , and the genetic regulation of growth rate in response to both nutrient levels  @xcite and quorum sensing  @xcite .",
    "growth in microbial groups also often relies on growth - promoting secretions , which themselves can be under nutrient and quorum sensing regulation  @xcite .    despite the potential complexities",
    ", the spatio - genetic patterns in microbial biofilms can be visualized by fluorescent labeling part of the population  @xcite . with this setup ,",
    "cells of the same color can be ancestrally related , while cells of different colors can not ( provided mutations that switch colors can be neglected ) .",
    "colony biofilms are particularly amenable to such visualizations  @xcite . as an example",
    ", the fluorescent image of a bacterial colony is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrations]a .",
    "the most striking feature of this image is that an initially well - mixed population of two alleles spatially separates or demixes into monoallelic sectors .",
    "the sectoring pattern in this colony is due to genetic drift at the front of the expansion , i.e. stochastic changes in the allele frequencies due to random variation in the number of offspring keeping up with the outgoing expansion . since at any given time only a few cells at the edge of the expansion",
    "colonize the petri dish , the fluctuations can be large and lead to random local increase in the number of cells of one color at the expense of the other . once one of the colors becomes extinct as a result of this stochastic process in a small region of the expanding colony ,",
    "a sector is formed , and it persists as long as its boundaries do not coalesce .",
    "such spatio - genetic correlations significantly affect the evolutionary dynamics of populations  @xcite .",
    "general examples range from the neutral theory in ecology  @xcite and evolution  @xcite , through the propensity for malignant tumor formation  @xcite , to the evolution of cooperation  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the latter has direct relevance to microbes and the evolution of growth - promoting secretions that are cooperative in the sense that the secretion of one cell will help others grow .",
    "these secretions often require strong spatio - genetic structure that prevent exploitative genotypes from using the secretions of the cooperative genotypes  @xcite .    here",
    ", we use the spatio - genetic patterns in bacterial colonies to test the population genetics models of range expansions .",
    "we begin by synthesizing and extending the theory of range expansions in a way that allows us to compare the predictions of this theory to our experimental data . in particular , two aspects of the theory are novel .",
    "first , we find that chiral or non - neutral growth results in sector boundaries being logarithmic spirals [ eq .  ( [ eaveragephi ] ) ] .",
    "second , we present a detailed discussion on the role of population density on the number of surviving sectors . this theory of range expansions is tested using experiments with two ecologically distinct bacterial species : the gut microbe _",
    "escherichia coli _ and the opportunistic pathogen _",
    "pseudomonas aeruginosa_. specifically , we test the dependence of the genetic diversity at the population front  ( sector number ) on the physical size of the founding population  ( initial radius of the colony ) and check the assumption that boundaries between genotypes perform radial random walks .",
    "we show that the model not only captures the qualitative relationship between demographic parameters and spatio - genetic patterns , but it also allows us to estimate these parameters with considerable accuracy .",
    "this quantitative validation of the theory supports the utility of population genetics models to capture the evolutionary process .",
    "data deposited at dryad : doi:10.5061/dryad.3147q .",
    "we used the same two strains of _ e. coli _ as in  @xcite , where it was shown that these strains are equally fit in well - mixed liquid culture and genetically identical except for the different fluorescent protein gene carried on plasmids .",
    "the _ p. aeruginosa _ strain was generously provided by roberto kolter and was originally isolated from fresh water in columbia .",
    "we labeled this strain with cfp and yfp  @xcite resulting in two strains , which are also genetically identical except for the fluorescence gene inserted in the chromosome .",
    "the pairs of colored strains within each species grew at the same rate and behaved neutrally on the plates .",
    "this was confirmed from the shape of the sector boundaries in the experiments  @xcite . in particular , strains with a fitness advantage would tend to curve outward and cut off neighboring strains ; see eq .",
    "this boundary bending was not observed and the analysis of sector boundaries showed that , both for _ e. coli _ and _ p. aeruginosa _ , the pairs of colored strains had the same fitness in our experiments ; see results .",
    "each strain was first grown separately in  @xmath0 of liquid lb medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic  ( carbenicillin for _ e. coli _ and gentamycin for _ p. aeruginosa _ ) at the concentration of  @xmath1 .",
    "the test tubes were incubated at  @xmath2 and constantly shaken .",
    "after an overnight growth , bacteria were diluted to an optical density of @xmath3 ( at @xmath4 wavelength ) in  @xmath0 of liquid lb medium without antibiotics and grown for @xmath5  hours .",
    "then , the two strains of interest were mixed in 1:1 ratio , as measured by optical density , and a small volume of bacterial mix ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 was pipetted on a lb - agar plate with  @xmath8 agar and  @xmath1 of appropriate antibiotic .",
    "the plates were then incubated at  @xmath9 or  @xmath2 and high humidity .",
    "_ e. coli _ strains did not grow at  @xmath9 .",
    "fluorescent images were obtained with a fluorescence stereoscope zeiss lumar v.12 and a scanner amersham 392 typhoon 9400 ( ge healthcare ) .",
    "scanned plates were imaged from the bottom at  @xmath10 resolution with alexa 526 filter .",
    "the initial radii of the colonies were measured within an hour of inoculation by fitting a circle to the colony boundary using the fluorescent microscope software .",
    "the number of sectors in each colony was calculated manually . `",
    "matlab r2007 ` was used to extract the radii of the colonies at later times and the shape of sector boundaries from the images . in particular",
    ", we used the routine  ` edge ` to identify sector boundaries , and a least square fitting routine to find the circumference of colonies  @xcite .    to calculate the heterozygosity  @xmath11 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : heterozygosity ] ) and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heterozygosity ] , we obtained the allele frequencies  @xmath12 along a set of concentric circles  ( which stand for different time points ) . while , in simulations , the frequencies are known , we had to calculate  @xmath12 in experiments from the fluorescence intensities of the colony images .",
    "this was done by choosing a threshold intensity such that any pixel with higher intensity is assigned  @xmath13 and any pixel with lower intensity is assigned  @xmath14 .",
    "we then used eq .",
    "( [ eq : heterozygosity ] ) to calculate the heterozygosity , and the averaging was done over all the points angle  @xmath15 apart in a given circle and all the circles corresponding to the same time point in the colonies used in that experiment .      here",
    "we describe how  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 were estimated from fluorescent images of genetic demixing .",
    "the diffusion constant  ( @xmath18 in table  [ tnrfit ] ) was estimated from the random walks of sector boundaries .",
    "we first obtained the polar coordinates  @xmath19 of individual sector boundaries as described above .",
    "once the coordinates were known for  @xmath20 , we evaluated  @xmath21 for each boundary .",
    "we then estimated the mean and variance of this quantity as a function of  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the model accurately described boundary motion , and the variance of  @xmath21 was a linear function of  @xmath23 ; therefore ,  @xmath24 was found from the least mean square estimate of the slope .",
    "in addition , both  @xmath16 and  @xmath17  ( @xmath25 in table  [ tnrfit ] ) were estimated from the experiments done with different volumes of inoculant .",
    "different volumes of inoculant led to different initial radii of the colonies , which were measured as described above .",
    "the observed values of radii were then binned , and the average number of sectors at the end of the experiment ( when coalescence of sectors ceased ) were calculated within each bin .",
    "the average number of sectors was a linear function of the square root of the initial radius .",
    "the least mean square estimate equals  @xmath26 for the slope and  @xmath27 for the intercept ; see eq .",
    "( [ enr ] ) . since both  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 were measured directly , these least mean square estimates allowed us to measure  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 .",
    "we also tested our genetic demixing model described below via simulations designed to mimic range expansions of natural populations .",
    "in these simulations , the habitat was a square lattice of islands that could support at most  @xmath30 individuals , similar to that in the stepping - stone model  @xcite . during every time step ,",
    "each island had one opportunity for outward migration and one opportunity for growth .    during the migration update ,",
    "an individual from an island could migrate to a randomly selected nearest neighbor island with a probability proportional to the fraction of cells on the island and the fraction of empty spots  ( vacancies ) on that neighbor island .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality  @xmath31 determined the magnitude of the effective diffusion constant , and was used to vary the rate of migration . since the migration rate was proportional to the fraction of vacancies ,",
    "an organism could exchange positions only with a vacancy , not another organism .",
    "hence , there was no migration in the dense - packed interior of the simulated colony .",
    "its spatio - genetic pattern was thus a frozen record of the genetic composition of the expansion front , similar to  @xcite .",
    "hence , we analyzed both the experimental data and the simulation data on an equal footing .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used on all four sides of the two - dimensional habitat .    during the growth update , a randomly selected individual in each island reproduced with a probability proportional to the fraction of the cells on the island and the fraction of vacancies on that island ; the coefficient of proportionality  @xmath32 allowed us to vary the growth rate .",
    "we checked that this update rule could reproduce simple logistic growth  @xcite . to compare with the experiments",
    ", we simulated only two alleles and tracked the genetic identity of the individuals throughout the simulation .",
    "a typical simulated range expansion is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : illustrations]b .",
    "we also carried out simulations using an off - lattice , agent - based approach that explicitly described the dynamics of each agent based on the micro - environment it perceived .",
    "the agents represented cells and their behavior was governed by the rules that mimic the behavior of real bacteria : they increased in radius when taking up nutrients , divided once they reached a certain critical size , and moved continuously  ( off - lattice ) when pushed by neighboring cells .",
    "the pushing algorithm was based on a hard - sphere model where each agent moved in the direction minimizing the overlap with neighboring agents .",
    "the model used a fast numerical method ( fas multigrid ) to solve partial differential equations for the nutrient concentration .",
    "the algorithms were described in a previous publication  @xcite .",
    "we simulated neutral evolution experiments by implementing two genotypes with equal phenotypes except for their color .",
    "agent growth was determined by the local concentration of the growth - limiting nutrient following monod kinetics , see  @xcite .",
    "simulations were initiated with a number of individuals placed in a circular homeland .",
    "the growth of the agents and colony was then followed in time , producing structures such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrations]c .",
    "the importance of space to evolutionary processes has been studied in many disciplines including population genetics , ecology , and probability theory , where the classic spatial models , for example the stepping - stone model  @xcite , hubbell s model  @xcite , and the voter model  @xcite have been developed for stationary  ( non - expanding ) populations .",
    "following @xcite , we use coalescent theory  @xcite to track the genetic diversity at different points in space and adapt the classic results from spatial population genetics  @xcite to understand the evolutionary dynamics of clonal populations during a range expansion .",
    "while neutral expansions typically occur on a two - dimensional surface , a one - dimensional model is sufficient to understand how genetic diversity changes at the front of the expanding population . for stationary ( non - expanding ) populations",
    ", the dimensionality of space plays an important role  @xcite , and dimensional reduction from two to one spatial dimensions is impossible . in expanding populations however , this dimensional reduction is possible because all relevant dynamics occurs at the perimeter of the population , which is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "indeed , the organisms far behind the expansion front can not affect the future genetic composition at the frontier because their offspring are not part of the outgoing expansion wave .",
    "although the dynamics of allele frequencies at the front can be described by an effective one - dimensional model , this is not in general true for the population in the wake of the expansion , for which a full two - dimensional model is necessary .",
    "nevertheless , the results of the one - dimensional model are applicable behind the front on the time scales when migration in the interior can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "although a one - dimensional model is easier to analyze , the demographic parameters in this model are in general complicated functions of the demographic parameters of the original two - dimensional population .",
    "for example , the effective linear density  ( carefully defined in appendix  a ) of the one - dimensional population at the frontier depends on the carrying capacity of the habitat , the shape of the density profile at the front , and the probability of individuals slightly behind the expansion edge to migrate forward  @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of these dependences varies for different reproduction and migration models , but the effective one - dimensional description is universal , once model - specific details are absorbed in the effective demographic parameters .    to make a direct connection with the subsequent experiments , we assume that only two genotypes are present , and that they have the same fitness .",
    "we also assume that the colony radius  @xmath33 increases linearly with time  @xmath34 :    @xmath35    where  @xmath29 is the radial expansion velocity , and  @xmath36 is the radius of the colony when  @xmath37 .",
    "expansions with a constant velocity are expected for reaction - diffusion population dynamics  @xcite and have been observed in microbial colonies  @xcite .",
    "range expansions in our simulations also obey eq .",
    "( [ ert ] ) .    spatial genetic demixing  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illustrations ] ) is one of the key predictions of this model .",
    "although the total number of individuals is very large , locally only a finite number reproduce , leading to genetic drift ( i.e. fluctuations in the genetic composition of a population due to the random sampling of offspring to form next generation ) . over time , these demographic fluctuations tend to reduce genetic diversity at the growing front of the population .",
    "eventually , a single genotype will reach fixation at any point on the expanding edge . in bacterial colonies , this fixation manifests as the formation of a sector  ( fig .  [ fig : illustrations]a ) .",
    "below we present two complimentary ways to rigorously analyze the behavior of the one - dimensional population at the expansion front .",
    "the first approach is an extension of classic spatial population genetics  @xcite using coalescent theory  @xcite to track the genetic diversity at different points in space . at the core of this approach",
    "is the stepping - stone model  @xcite , which describes migration and reproduction of individuals in a population .",
    "a concise description of this model is given in appendix  a. the second modeling approach was proposed in  @xcite and tracks the domain _ boundaries _ between the regions with different genotypes . while it is applicable only after monoallelic domains  ( sectors ) form , the second approach yields predictions complimentary to the predictions of the first approach .",
    "we use these additional predictions to make an quantitative experimental test of our theory .",
    "spatial genetic demixing can be most readily understood by calculating the genetic diversity of the population over time .",
    "the genetic composition of the front at time  @xmath34 is fully described by the relative fraction  ( frequency ) of one of the two alleles  @xmath12 , where  @xmath15 is the azimuthal angle around the center of the population .",
    "the relative fraction of the other allele is then  @xmath38 .",
    "these fractions change in time because of migration and reproduction .",
    "one can think of the population as a circle of islands  ( demes ) each carrying a certain number of organisms  ( this number of organisms sets the strength of genetic drift ) .",
    "each generation , the organisms reproduce within a deme , say by a wright - fisher process , and migrate between neighboring demes .",
    "this conceptual population model is the stepping - stone model of  @xcite ; we present a mathematical formulation of the stepping - stone model in appendix  a.    because  @xmath12 is a random variable , which is different for every expansion , we need to calculate quantities averaged over repeated expansions to compare the predictions of the model to experimental data . the first moment  ( mean ) of  @xmath12 does not contain information about genetic demixing , because the relative fraction of two neutral genotypes does not change on average    @xmath39   = f_{0},\\ ] ]    where  @xmath40 is the initial frequency of allele one , and  @xmath41 denotes averaging with respect to different realizations of the range expansion .    the second moment  ( variance ) , however , captures the spatio - genetic correlations .",
    "we define the average spatial heterozygosity as    @xmath42\\ } \\\\ & + \\mathbb{e}\\{f(t,\\phi_{2})[1-f(t,\\phi_{1})]\\ } ,   \\end{split } \\label{eq : heterozygosity}\\ ] ]    which is the probability of sampling two different alleles separated by distance  @xmath43 along the circular frontier .",
    "note that  @xmath44 depends only on the relative separation between the two points because of rotational invariance of the averages .    at the beginning of the expansion ,  @xmath45 because the individuals are well mixed . as the expansion progresses and large monoallelic domains appear , the average spatial heterozygosity decreases for  @xmath15 smaller than the typical domain size because sampling two different alleles in close proximity is unlikely when the population is demixed .",
    "for  @xmath15 much larger than the typical domain size , the average spatial heterozygosity is close to  @xmath28 because the two sampling points belong to different and uncorrelated sectors carrying allele one with probability  @xmath40 or allele two with probability  @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the spatial scale over which  @xmath11 increases from its lowest value to  @xmath28 characterizes the typical domain size .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : heterozygosity]a and the discussion below . )    as in well - mixed populations , the depression of  @xmath11 for small  @xmath15 can be understood by working backward in time and calculating the probability of two individuals to have a common ancestor .",
    "apart from  @xmath34 , this probability depends on the spatial separation of the individuals , the extent of lateral movement during the expansion , and the density of the population .",
    "indeed , for their ancestral lineages to coalesce  ( converge on the common ancestor ) , the spatial random walks performed by the lineages must move to the same spatial location , and the lineages must originate from the same individual in that location .",
    "therefore , the forward - in - time equation for the dynamics of  @xmath11 must have a diffusion term to account for the lateral random walk of the ancestral lineages and a sink term to account for the loss of genetic diversity due to lineage coalescence .",
    "this equation is rigorously derived in  @xcite ( see also appendix  a ) and is given below    @xmath47    where  @xmath48 is dirac s delta function ,  @xmath17 is the spatial diffusion constant of an ancestral lineage , and  @xmath49 is the coalescence rate of two ancestral lineages separated by distance  @xmath50 along the front .",
    "this rate and , therefore ,  @xmath16 are inversely proportional to the generation time and decreases with the population density at the front because the probability of two nearby organisms to be siblings is inversely proportional to the effective population density  @xcite , defined in appendix  a. in other words ,  @xmath16 is a phenomenological parameter characterising the strength of genetic drift .",
    "although one may naively expect that  @xmath16 is inversely proportional to the actual population density ( or carrying capacity ) , this is often not the case  @xcite .",
    "the factors of  @xmath51 are necessary to relate the angular coordinate  @xmath15 to distances along the constantly inflating circumference of the population .    from the forward - in - time perspective , the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eomh ] ) represents the diffusive mixing in the population , and the second term is responsible for the loss of genetic diversity due to sampling .",
    "smaller population densities lead to more severe bottlenecks , faster reduction in local genetic diversity , and , therefore , larger values of  @xmath16 .",
    "the exact solution of eq .",

    "this decrease of the probability to find two different alleles at the same spatial location  [ given by @xmath53 tracks local fixation and the formation of sectors .",
    "there are two important time scales for the genetic demixing process in the model .",
    "the first time scale characterizes the interplay of migration and genetic drift and is the time over which genetic diversity is lost locally ( monoallelic domains form ) when radial growth is slow .",
    "as it was shown in  @xcite , this time scale is given by    @xmath54    the other time scale characterizes the rate of the spatial expansion and is the time it takes the colony to double its initial radius :    @xmath55    as we shall show below , the ordering of these time scales  ( @xmath56 vs. @xmath57 ) determines whether the domain formation is sensitive to the constant increase in the front circumference .    for long times  @xmath58 and  @xmath59 ,",
    "the average spatial heterozygosity  @xmath11 reaches a steady state , see fig .",
    "[ fig : heterozygosity]a and  @xcite .",
    "at this point , the diffusive motion of the sector boundaries is negligible compared to the deterministic increase in separation among sector boundaries due to colony expansion ; therefore , the sector boundaries stop coalescing , and their relative angular positions remain largely unchanged .",

    "thus , for  @xmath64 , @xmath72 , which implies that sector boundaries appear much earlier than the time when the deterministic expansion moves them far apart . consequently , sector boundaries have a significant chance to coalesce , eliminating some of the sectors . ]",
    "this term was first calculated in  @xcite by neglecting the initial stage of genetic demixing when distinct sectors appear .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ enr ] ) is an additional contribution to  @xmath63 from the early stage of genetic demixing and gives the dominant contribution in the opposite limit  @xmath73 when sectors do not coalesce after formation .",
    "equation  ( [ enr ] ) allows us to estimate  @xmath17 and  @xmath16 ( see methods ) , and forms the basis of the quantitative test of spatial population genetics discussed below .",
    "although eq .",

    "[ fig : illustrations ] .",
    "we now introduce a second modeling approach to understand genetic demixing that ignores the dynamics of individual organisms and instead focuses on a larger spatial scale of domain boundaries among monoallelic regions . this forward - in - time approach is simpler than , and complementary to , the coalescent analysis outlined in the previous section .",
    "after the sectors form , the dynamics of the population can be described in terms of sector boundaries . as ancestral lineages ,",

    "these parameters do not have well - defined values because cells are rod shaped and the generation time presumably depends on the location of a cell relative to the front , where the nutrients are readily available .",

( [ eq : dg ] ) ] , the strength of genetic drift  @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of effective population density  @xmath101 ; in fact ,  @xmath102 .",
    "we find that the effective number of cells in a spatial region of the size of a cell ,  @xmath94 , is smaller or much smaller than one , as has been predicted by  @xcite .",
    "expanding bacterial colonies are subject to strong genetic drift , resulting in local extinctions of the genotypes present in the population .",
    "these local extinctions manifest themselves in the formation of mono - allelic sectors , provided the organisms migrate very slowly behind the expansion front . despite the potential for complexity in the physical and biotic interactions within bacterial groups , our experiments strongly suggest that these boundaries behave as annihilating random walks , and we show how to estimate their diffusion coefficients from the fluorescent images of spatial genetic demixing ( see methods ) .",
    "the spatial separation of two alleles in an expanding bacterial colony can also be described by a generalization of the stepping - stone model , which accounts not only for the behavior of the sector boundaries but also for their formation from the initially well - mixed population .",
    "although the expansion takes place on a two - dimensional surface , our experiments and simulations strongly suggest that its effects on the genetic composition of the population front can be described by a simple one - dimensional model with only four parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath36 , and @xmath29 ) , all of which can be measured experimentally as described in methods .",
    "this generalization of the stepping - stone model not only explains spatial genetic demixing but also characterizes neutral evolutionary dynamics of expanding populations quantitatively , just as the wright - fisher and moran models capture essential aspects of the dynamics of stationary well - mixed populations . this quantitative description and the methods of estimating the model parameters could be important for understanding evolution within microbial communities .",
    "for example , the survival probability of a beneficial mutation depends on  @xmath16 , characterizing the strength of genetic drift in spatially extended populations  @xcite , and the evolution of cooperation depends on the relatedness  ( or assortment ) of the organisms , which is described by  @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a better understanding of bacterial range expansions could also facilitate the development of new methods of genetic inference from spatially resolved data .",
    "more generally , we believe that a key contribution of this study is to illustrate the potential of spatial population genetic models to make quantitative predictions . clearly , our bacterial system is not representative of all species and is a system that lends itself to making measurements that will not always be possible in other species .",
