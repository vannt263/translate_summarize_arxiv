    "more than twenty years ago bodmer and later witten put a hypothesis that the absolute ground state of strongly interacting matter is the deconfined state of quark matter consisting of an equal proportion of up , down , and strange quarks called strange quark matter even at zero temperature and zero pressure @xcite .    recently some exotic baryon systems including strange quarks were discovered .",
    "for example , the penta - quark , called @xmath4 , consisting of 5 quarks ( @xmath5 ) with an extraordinary small width @xmath625mev , was discovered at spring8 @xcite . at kek ,",
    "a strongly bounded kaonic system , @xmath7 @xcite , which was predicted from an amd calculation @xcite to form a high density system of 10@xmath0 , was discovered . from an astrophysical point of view",
    ", there is a possibility that the strange quark matter is realized at the center of neutron stars and/or quark stars @xcite . at high baryon density such as in the core of these stars ,",
    "quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) may exist and confined baryon and deconfined baryon states may coexist @xcite . searching for the energy region",
    "in which the hadron to quark transition occurs and the strange quark matter becomes stable is one of the most interesting topics in high energy hadron physics .    in this paper we study the stability of quark matter at finite baryon density at zero temperature using a molecular dynamics method ( md ) . in this framework",
    "it is not necessary to assume whether the state of quarks is confined or deconfined and their mixed state can also be treated @xcite .",
    "we define the total wave function of a system @xmath8 with baryon number @xmath9 as a direct product of single particle wave functions with a gaussian wave packet in coordinate space and a state vector @xmath10 with a fixed spin orientation , flavor and color , @xmath11\\chi_i.\\ ] ] the antisymmetrization of the wave function is neglected , but treated phenomenologically by introducing a pauli potential which acts as a repulsive force between quarks of the same color , flavor and spin orientation .",
    "matter after cooling .",
    "the white circles denote confined quarks and colored circles are deconfined quarks.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a spurious zero point kinetic energy of clusters as described in @xcite .",
    "the original hamiltonian @xmath14 and @xmath15 are explicitly expressed as , @xmath16   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we use @xmath19=1.25 ( the qcd fine structure constant ) , @xmath20=900mev / fm ( string tension ) , constituent quark masses @xmath21=300mev and @xmath22=500mev throughout this simulation which are typical values of parameters in quark models",
    ". the product of gell - mann matrices for different colors and for same colors are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . however , since the antisymmetrization is neglected in our model , we multiply those values by 4 to effectively include the exchange term of color interaction . to introduce the nuclear force between white ( colorless ) baryons",
    ", we employ the meson exchange potential @xmath25 acting between quarks .",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 meson - quark coupling constants are @xmath28=3.42 and @xmath29=9.0 , the meson masses are @xmath30=300mev and @xmath31=782mev , respectively . the parameters in the pauli potential @xmath15 are determined to reproduce the kinetic energy of the fermi gas @xcite . in the present study",
    "we adopt @xmath32=131mev , @xmath33=1.8fm , @xmath34=120mev for _ u _ and _ d _ quarks and @xmath32=79mev for _ s _ quarks . the size of the quark wave packet , @xmath35 , is taken to be 0.43fm , whereas @xmath36 = 0.7fm is used in @xmath37 to take into account of the baryon size @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the ground state ( zero temperature ) of matter consisting of quarks . as an initial condition",
    "we distribute `` hadrons '' ( made from 3 quarks with different colors ) randomly in a cell with a periodic boundary condition . in the case of baryon density , e.g. , of 1@xmath0 , 90 quarks are put in a cell of a size 5.6 fm . to search for the minimum energy configuration of the system",
    ", we solve the cooling equations of motion with friction terms as in @xcite .",
    "the simulations are performed for `` @xmath2 matter '' ( with same numbers of @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks ) , `` @xmath3 matter '' ( number of @xmath39 quarks is twice that of @xmath38 quarks ) and `` @xmath1 matter '' ( with same numbers of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 quarks ) .",
    "snapshots of the @xmath3 matter for different baryon densities are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "all quarks are confined as hadrons at baryon density of 1@xmath0 . at @xmath41 ,",
    "a partly deconfined state can be seen , whereas almost all quarks are deconfined at @xmath42 .",
    "the ground state energies of matter are shown with solid lines in fig .  2 .",
    "the dashed lines show results with a constraint that @xmath43 of 3 quarks in each initial `` hadron '' should always be equal ( to keep hadrons by hand ) . here",
    "we call this calculation `` hadron - cooling '' , while the normal one we call `` quark - cooling '' . at lower density",
    ", the energy of the system by hadron - cooling agrees that by quark - cooling .",
    "this means that quarks are confined in hadrons as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "note that the saturation of hadronic matter is realized around 1@xmath0 for the first time in this kind of quark md simulation .",
    "the energies of the @xmath2 matter and the @xmath3 matter are almost the same .",
    "this is because the pauli potential is not fully effective for `` hadrons '' and @xmath44 meson exchange is missing . at densities of 2  3@xmath0 , transition to deconfined phase occurs . in our simulation , the decrease of the kinetic energy and the increase of the potential energy act oppositely during the deconfinement",
    ". the softening of the latter effect may be the origin of the transition at higher densities .",
    "figure 3 shows comparison of energy among the @xmath2 matter with relativistic electrons , the @xmath3 matter and the @xmath1 matter under charge neutral condition .",
    "although the @xmath1 matter is the most unstable at low density , it becomes more stable than the @xmath2 matter as deconfinement occurs at 3@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath3 matter , however , is the most stable over all ranges in our present result .",
    "quark many - body systems were studied in a framework of md . it has been found that hadron matter undergoes a phase transition to the quark matter as baryon density increases . at low density ,",
    "the saturation for the @xmath2 matter is realized by introducing @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath1 matter , however , also show the similar saturation because exactly the same meson exchange potentials are used among all quarks . to improve this ,",
    "a flavor - dependent potential like @xmath44 meson exchange potential is needed .",
    "the @xmath1 matter becomes more stable than the charge - neutral @xmath2 matter at 3@xmath0 .",
    "but the @xmath3 matter is the most stable even at high density .",
    "we expect more reasonable results if @xmath44 meson exchange potential is included in the future",
