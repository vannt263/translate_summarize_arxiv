    "moreover , the metropolis @xcite and the glauber @xcite algorithms used in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are very general and easy to implement . in practice things are not so simple . near second - order phase transitions the configurations generated by these algorithms present strong temporal correlations ( critical slowing down ) , which prevent an efficient sampling of the configuration space . in addition , hysteresis effects due to metastability prevent a precise location of first - order transition lines .    in the last years , several techniques",
    "have been proposed to circumvent these problems such as the reweighting technique by berg and neuhaus @xcite and the simulated tempering by marinari and parisi @xcite .",
    "a different approach is the use of cluster algorithms pioneered by swendsen and wang @xcite and by wolff @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown the efficiency of cluster algorithms in reducing the critical slowing down @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the cluster dynamics may practically eliminate metastability in first order phase transitions so far this has been achieved only for the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) spin-1 model @xcite , for which a special cluster algorithm has been developed @xcite .    in this paper , we present a simple cluster algorithm that eliminates metastability in first - order phase transitions and combine it to the sauerwein and de oliveira ( so ) method that allows us to obtain the surface pressure directly from numerical simulations @xcite . in the original formulation of the so method , the authors used the metropolis dynamics to generate the system configurations .",
    "however , as explained above , this is not the best choice near phase boundaries .",
    "we also introduce a simple procedure to calculate the order parameters and the concentrations of molecules in the neighborhood of a first - order line from numerical simulations .    as an application of our method",
    ", we have determined the phase diagrams of the andelman model for langmuir monolayers made of chiral molecules .",
    "more specifically , we were interested in surface pressure versus concentration phase diagrams , which are more interesting from the experimental point of view .",
    "the andelman model was first studied by using the mean field approach on a bipartite lattice @xcite .",
    "however , x - ray diffraction experiments suggest that the condensed phases of langmuir monolayers tend to form triangular structures , and not a bipartite lattice as considered by andelman . in order to be more consistent with the physics of langmuir monolayers , pelizzola et al @xcite",
    "have studied the heterochiral case on a two dimensional triangular lattice , using the cluster variation method , and have obtained phase diagrams that are qualitatively different from andelman s .",
    "we study through mc simulations the remaining homochiral case , and we show that , in contrast with the heterochiral case , the mc and the mean field methods give results that are in good agreement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the andelman model , in section 3 we present the cluster algorithm and briefly review the sauerwein de oliveira method , in section 4 we discuss the numerical results and conclude in section 5 .",
    "langmuir monolayers are formed by spreading amphiphilic molecules in an air - water interface .",
    "amphiphilic molecules are strongly asymmetric , constituted by two parts with opposite features . the first part ",
    "the head , is hydrophilic .",
    "it is made of polar chemical groups and remains on the water . the second part ",
    "the tail , is hydrophobic and made of hydrocarbon chains which remain in the air . when the tail is strongly hydrophobic , so that the molecules are insoluble in water , langmuir monolayers form a quasi - two dimensional system . this system can be described in terms of the surface pressure and temperature and it displays several phases with different structural properties ( see , for instance ref @xcite ) .    a chiral molecule exists in two forms @xmath0 and @xmath1 , called enantiomers , related by a spatial transformation that involves a change of parity",
    ". an important feature of the physics of chiral langmuir monolayers is the determination of the chiral discrimination , which occurs when the interaction energy between enantiomers with the same chirality is different from the interaction energy of enantiomers with different chirality .",
    "when the intermolecular forces favor the attraction between enantiomers of the same species , they are denominated homochiral and they lead to chiral segregation . on the contrary , if the attraction between different enantiomers is favored , they are named heterochiral and they lead to a racemic mixture .    to study the effect of the chirality theoretically , andelman proposed a simple lattice gas model that can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 where the first sum is over nearest - neighbor pairs , the letters @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the sites of a two - dimensional triangular lattice , the letters @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the enantiomer species ( @xmath7 or @xmath1 ) , @xmath8 are the coupling energies ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 are the occupation numbers at site @xmath3 , and @xmath12 is the chemical potential of the species @xmath6 .",
    "this model is equivalent to the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) spin-1 model @xcite , as it can be seen by relating the occupation numbers and the spin-1 variables through the relations @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 represents a @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) enantiomer and @xmath16 a vacancy . in this way",
    ", we obtain the beg hamiltonian @xmath17 -\\sum_{i}[h \\sigma_i - \\delta \\sigma_i^2 ] ,     \\label{e3}\\ ] ] the case @xmath18 corresponds to the homochiral case ( ferromagnetic beg ) . when @xmath19 , we have the heterochiral one ( antiferromagnetic beg ) .",
    "we will concern ourselves with the homochiral case , since it has not been studied beyond the mean - field approach .",
    "the parameters @xmath20 depend on the interaction energies @xmath9 and @xmath21 between nearest - neighbor enantiomers through the formulae @xmath22 and @xmath23 the fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related to the chemical potential of the species @xmath0 and @xmath1 and they are given by @xmath26 and @xmath27 they are the conjugate parameters of the chiral order parameter and the density of enantiomers defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 where the @xmath30 are the total number of enantiomers @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "in particular , we are interested in determining the concentration of enantiomers @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively ) given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 .    in this work",
    "we shall study first - order transitions between _ concentrated phases _ where the enantiomers are close to each other ( phases @xmath38 and @xmath39 rich in enantiomers of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) and the so called _ liquid expanded _ ( @xmath40 ) _ phases _ , where there are many vacancies . in the spin-1 language , we shall study transitions between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases rich in zero spins .",
    "in experiments involving chiral langmuir monolayers the non chiral contribution to the interaction energy between the enantiomers is usually larger than the chiral one . in our simplified model",

    ", we propose the following cluster algorithm :    1 .",
    "choose randomly a site on the lattice and denote @xmath50 the value of its spin .",
    "this is the first spin of the cluster ( seed ) .",
    "2 .   choose , with the probability 0.5 , one of the two other possible spin values that are different from @xmath50 . call this new value @xmath51",
    "( it will remain fixed during the construction of the cluster ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath50 is @xmath0 , @xmath52 can be @xmath1 or @xmath53 .",
    "3 .   activate the links between the seed and its nearest neighbors that are equal to @xmath50 with probability @xmath54 .",
    "each new spin connected to the cluster by an activated link is added to the cluster .",
    "next , we repeat the activation procedure to all the new spins of the cluster .",
    "the process stops when all nearest neighbors have been tested and no new spin is accepted .",
    "now , we attempt to change this cluster with spins equal to @xmath50 into a cluster with spins @xmath51 ( see fig .",

    "one usually calculates one of its derivatives and numerically integrate the results . to use this technique one has to know the value of the grand canonical potential at a reference point and",

    "note that with the metropolis algorithm the system is trapped in metastable states and even after millions of mc steps it does not undergo a transition to the stable phase .",
