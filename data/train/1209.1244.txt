    "the standard model description of cp violation is encoded in a single , irreducible phase in the @xmath13 quark mixing matrix called the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "one of the foremost tasks in the past decades has been to study the @xmath14 unitarity triangle , the graphical representation of the condition stemming from the unitarity of the ckm matrix : @xmath15 , whose angles @xmath16 satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast with the precise results on @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite , our knowledge of the angle @xmath0 is rather uncertain , with a precision of roughly @xmath20 .",
    "this is one of the dominant sources of the current uncertainties on the apex of the @xmath14 unitary triangle .",
    "one of the major efforts in flavor physics by lhcb and the future superb factory experiments will be devoted to reduce the errors in @xmath0 .    in this work  @xcite",
    ", we propose a new method based on @xmath21 decays with @xmath22 being a light scalar / tensor meson . among the various modes to be discussed , of special interest",
    "are the @xmath2 modes , where @xmath23 is a @xmath24 scalar ( tensor ) resonance .",
    "the small ( zero ) decay constant of @xmath25(@xmath26 ) compensates the large wilson coefficient in the color - allowed amplitude , leading to comparable decay amplitudes of @xmath27 and @xmath28 . as a consequence ,",
    "large cp asymmetries are predicted .",
    "measurements of branching ratios ( brs ) of the neutral @xmath5 decays into @xmath6 and time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath29 ( @xmath30 @xmath31 are also useful to extract the angle @xmath0 . in addition , the combination @xmath10 and @xmath12 could be extracted via time - dependent measurements of the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 which may have large cp asymmetries .",
    "the angle @xmath35 is the relative weak phase of the decays induced by the @xmath36 and @xmath37 transition .",
    "the proposed method in this work uses the information that the six decay amplitudes of @xmath38 form two triangles in the complex plane , graphically manifesting the identities @xmath39 in which we have adopted the convention @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cp even and odd eigenstates .",
    "measurements of the decay rates of the six processes have the potential to completely determine the sides and apexes of the two triangles , more particularly the relative phase between @xmath42 and its cp conjugate @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",

    "in fact physical observables to be experimentally measured are defined in terms of these two quantities : @xmath47    up to now , experimental results on @xmath0 mostly come from the @xmath48  @xcite , in which the @xmath49 is suppressed by both ckm factor and color factor . the ratio of decay amplitudes @xmath50 is small and thereby the two triangles formed by decay amplitudes are very squashed . @xmath51 and @xmath52 have a mild sensitivity to the angle @xmath0 , inducing large experimental uncertainties in @xmath0  @xcite .    here",
    "we wish to stress that the low sensitivity problem is highly improved in @xmath53 due to @xmath54 and in particular large cp asymmetries are expected . although the color - allowed diagram has a large wilson coefficient @xmath55 , the emitted @xmath56 meson is produced from a local vector or axial - vector current ( at the lowest order in @xmath57 ) , whose matrix element between the qcd vacuum and the @xmath58(@xmath59 ) state is small ( identically zero ) . due to the suppression from decay",
