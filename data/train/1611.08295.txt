    "the discovery of the iron - based superconductors modified the notion of uniqueness of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates and is interesting even after eight years of its discovery not only because they have the ability to exhibit superconductivity at very high transition temperatures , but also because it provides a rich prototype interplay of various degrees freedom ; the lattice and the electronic charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom all have intriguing roles .",
    "the 122 family of fe based superconductors are metals but with multi - band and multi - orbitals at all doping ranges in their respective phase diagram , this should be contrasted with the case of high temperature copper - oxide superconductors which are mott - insulators when undoped .",
    "the undoped and doped fe - based superconductors undergo a structural transition from a high - temperature tetragonal phase to a low - temperature orthorhombic phase which may coincide with the magnetic transition or the structural transition precedes the magnetic transition .",
    "these compounds below the magnetic transition are believed to be antiferromagnetic like spin density wave ( sdw ) metal .",
    "these transitions are suppressed with electron or hole doping ( or pressure ) and superconductivity ( sc ) eventually appears beyond a certain doping concentration with high critical transition temperature along with coexistence between both sdw and sc in certain cases . presumably , this lead to a number of initial investigations mainly focused on the interplay and competition between a stripe - like antiferromagnetism ( where the magnetic ordering wave - vector is @xmath5 or @xmath6 in the 1fe / cell notation ) and superconductivity .",
    "it is popularly believed that an anti - s wave ( s@xmath7 ) nodal superconducting pairing symmetry @xcite is mediated through the fluctuations associated with the stripe sdw state .",
    "this can not however be valid with certainties to many of the fe- based superconducting families @xcite .    a number of studies on `` nematicity '' or strongly anisotropic in - plane transport properties like resistivity etc . which is also viewed as `` preferential transport '' in the 122 systems @xcite in the orthorhombic phase or in tetragonal phase in presence strain field , created a lot of attention leading to a new phase called ` nematic phase ' in the phase diagram of these materials .",
    "a nematic phase of matter is one in which the order parameter for a transition breaks rotational symmetry but time - reversal symmetry is preserved similar to the order parameter in the nematic phase of liquid crystals . by analogy , the orthorhombic state in fescs has been called a ` nematic state ' .",
    "such phases were well studied in classical soft matter systems @xcite , but not in their quantum counterparts in electronic systems . however , strongly correlated electron systems such as quantum hall systems , cuprates , bilayer ruthenates @xcite widely postulated their existence . in a crystalline lattice",
    ", a nematic phase corresponds to the breaking of discrete rotational symmetry , and in the context of the fe based sc , this order parameter is non - zero in the orthorhombic phase where the c@xmath8 symmetry is broken at the structural transition , t@xmath9 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in certain systems , the structural and the magnetic transition are identical ( t@xmath9=t@xmath10 ) , and since the magnetic order ( stripe sdw ) by itself breaks c@xmath8 symmetry , the primary order parameter for nematicity appears to be magnetic one .    in the nematic phase actually all the three parameters ( a ) structural distortion ( phonon driven ) , ( b ) charge / orbital order ( n@xmath0 , n@xmath1 being different ) , ( c ) spin order ( static spin susceptibility along q@xmath11 and q@xmath12 being different ) are non - zero @xcite , no mater what drives the nematic instability . a bilinear combinations of these order parameters ( a , b , c ) that break tetragonal symmetry are invariant under symmetry transformations and forms essential part of landau free energy .",
    "as a result , from principle of minimization one order parameter induces the other . and",
    "that is precisely the experimental challenge as how to determine the primary order parameter responsible for nematic transition .",
    "consequently , the issue of nematicity is more crucially posed for those systems where the structural transition precedes the magnetic one ( t@xmath13t@xmath10 ) , leaving a finite temperature interval where c@xmath8 symmetry is broken but the material remains paramagnetic @xcite .",
    "the most notable example being fese where only a structural transition @xcite is detected ( the difference between the t@xmath14 and t@xmath10 being the largest ) and the system remains paramagnetic till its sc phase @xcite , indicating that nematic degrees of freedom are not necessarily magnetic ones but probably orbital one . the microscopic origin of the nematic order is debatable with a few competitive probable scenarios @xcite .",
    "one scenario is that the structural transition is an anharmonic lattice potential driven instability , so the lattice orthorhombicity would be the primary order parameter .",
    "a second scenario is that the c@xmath8 symmetry is broken primarily by electronic interactions so that lattice degrees of freedom are secondary order parameters that passively follow the symmetry breaking induced by the electronic interactions hence the primary order parameter is electronic in origin .",
    "one such scenario is the spin - nematic transition whereby the spins of the two fe sublattices phase - lock , this breaks c@xmath8 symmetry , without developing any spontaneous magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ , without breaking time reversal symmetry @xcite . another possible candidate in this scenario is ferro - orbital ordering @xcite , where below nematic transition either the occupations or the hopping matrix elements ( or both ) of the d@xmath15 and the d@xmath16 orbitals of fe become inequivalent .",
    "apart from the above two electronic scenarios , other possibilities include a d - wave pomeranchuk instability @xcite , in which the fermi surfaces undergo symmetry - breaking distortions due to interaction effects .    from above discussions",
    "it turns out that the primary step would be to show beyond doubt as to whether the structural transition is electronic in origin or lattice driven .",
    "this is the main purpose of the present work . in this work",
    "we consider several fe - based superconducting materials from 122 family to show a direct quantitative correlations between the orbital order and orthorhombicity .",
    "the orbital order is calculated from electronic band structures through first principles simulations using doping and temperature dependent experimentally determined structural parameters .",
    "the orthorhombicity parameter is taken from already established experimental studies ( refs @xcite ) as a function or various doping concentrations .",
    "when such variations are normalized , be it thermal variation or doping dependent , both the above quantities ( orbital order and orthorhombicity ) quantitatively corresponds to each other in terms of their doping as well as temperature variations .",
    "this is shown universally for hole doped , electron doped and iso - electronic substituted materials .",
    "the orbital order being ( the difference in band energies e@xmath0 , e@xmath1 at high symmetry k - points ) derived from electronic band structure , its complete matching with orthorhombicity proves that the structural transition in fe - based materials is electronic in nature .",
    "this is thus a direct proof that orthorhombic distortion is _ not _ due to lattice but an electronic one . a first step to reject one of the order parameters that may lead to nematicity .",
    "that leaves orbital fluctuation or spin order as primary order for nematic phase .",
    "an universal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic structure are also obtained .",
    "most remarkable among them is the mapping of two fe - fe distances in the low temperature orthorhombic phase , with the band energies e@xmath0 , e@xmath1 of fe at the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "this correspondence of band energies with two fe - fe distances is true for its variation either with doping or temperature and is shown for a several undoped and doped 122 materials .",
    "furthermore , the fractional co - ordinate z@xmath17 of as which essentially determines the anion height is inversely ( directly ) proportional to fe - as bond distances ( with exception to k doped bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ) for hole ( electron ) doped materials as a function of doping . on the other hand ,",
    "fe - as bond - distance is found to be inversely ( directly ) proportional to the density of states at the fermi level for hole ( electron ) doped systems .",
    "chemical effect in terms of size of doping elements and nature of substitution , in - plane or out of plane is employed to understand various doping dependent electronic structures .",
    "thus as a whole this work is a complimentary theoretical studies to the explanations of experimental findings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , indeed spin origin is also very important and we have seen various spin structures of fe clearly influence z@xmath18 and the orbital order @xcite .",
    "such calculation will be published shortly .",
    "our first principles electronic structure calculations are performed by implementing ultrasoft pseudopotential with plane wave basis set based on density functional theory @xcite .",
    "electronic exchange correlation is treated within the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) using perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the density funtional theory within local density approximation ( lda ) as well as generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was unable to optimize the experimental value of @xmath2 ( fractional co - ordinate of as ) with desired accuracy @xcite .",
    "experimentally , in all iron chalcogenides / pnictides ( also in phosphides ) the chalcogen / pnictogen tetrahedron is found very close to regular tetrahedron .",
    "first principles density functional theory using lda and gga result in z - direction compressed tetrahedron by 0.1 to 0.15  difference .",
    "this is a structural mystery in the field of fe - based superconducting materials that remains unsolved even eight years after its discovery .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic fluctuation , associated with fe atoms in these materials @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , such underestimation of z@xmath17 leads to mutual shifts in the fe-3d bands upto 0.25 ev or slightly more which causes completely different behaviours in the structural parameters and huge difference in the fs from experimental situation @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "consideration of lda and gga exchange correlation functional do not make any difference . to overcome such a situation , we resort to experimentally determined lattice parameters _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath2 as a funtion of doping as well as temperature , instead of geometry optimized ( total energy minimization ) lattice parameters as inputs of our first principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "this is the best available solution at the moment because even finite temperature molecular dynamic simulation together with density functional study has failed this aspect and can not subtly obtain tetragonal to orthorhombic transition .",
    "we use experimental orthorhombic ( low temperature ) as well as tetragonal ( high temperature ) lattice parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath2 as input of our _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations . in order to dope the system theoretically , we use virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite as well as supercell approach ( specially for ru doping at fe site ) .",
    "non - spin - polarized and spin polarised single point energy calculations are carried out for tetragonal phase with space group symmetry i4/mmm ( no . 139 ) and orthorhombic phase with space group symmetry fmmm ( no . 69 ) respectively using ultrasoft pseudo - potentials and plane - wave basis set with energy cut off 600 ev and higher as well as self - consistent field ( scf ) tolerance as @xmath22 ev / atom . brillouin zone is sampled in the k space within monkhorst  pack scheme and grid size for scf calculation is chosen as per requirement of the calculation for different systems .",
    "first we calculate the band structures of various doped bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( ba122 ) compounds as a function of doping concentrations using experimental lattice parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath2 ) in the orthorhombic as well as tetragonal phases .",
    "we present the band structures around high symmetry k points ( @xmath23 , x and y ) of k and na doped ( _ i.e _ , hole doped ) ba122 systems in fig.[kbs ] and fig.[nabs ] respectively for various doping concentrations as indicated in figures .",

    "it is an well established fact that the electronic structure near the fl of these fe - based scs are mainly dominated by fe - d orbitals .",
    "it is quite evident from the two figures ( fig.[kbs ] and fig.[nabs ] ) that as a consequence of hole doping , hole like bands around @xmath23 points ( mainly d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 bands near fl ) expands as well as move away from the fl with increasing hole doping    na@xmath11fe@xmath4as@xmath4 system within vca method in the low temperature orhorhombic phase around @xmath23 ( 1st row ) , x ( 2nd row ) and y ( 3rd row ) points for ( a , b , c ) @xmath27 ( d , e , f ) @xmath25 and ( g , h , i ) @xmath26 respectively .",

    "on the other hand , electron like bands ( mainly d@xmath32 bands near fl ) become flat around x , y points as well as moves towards the fl .",
    "this whole scenario is consistent with the hole doping picture where hole like fermi surfaces expand and electron like fermi surfaces shrink with increasing doping concentration .",
    "figs [ nabs ] , [ kbs ] are ideal picture of inter band nesting whereas clear degradation of intra band nesting with doping .",
    "we also depict the calculated band structures around high symmetry points ( @xmath23 , x and y ) of p doped ( iso - electronic ) ba122 system in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases in fig.[pbs ] for various doping concentrations .",
    "fig.[pbs ] reveals that modifications in the position of the bands near fl due to p doping at as sites in ba122 system is comparatively weaker than hole doped 122 materials .",
    "however there is some visible moderation in the d@xmath32 band near fl around @xmath23 point with the variation of p doping concentration  exactly opposite behaviour with doping compared to the hole doped materials show in the top rows of figures 1 , 2 .",
    "this indicates effectively electron doping .",
    "iso - electronic p doping at as site is like in - plane substitution ( substitution in the fe - as layer ) contrasting with k or na substitution at ba site which is out of plane substitution ( in between two fe - as layer ) .",
    "therefore , p doping at as site affects the d@xmath32 bands more drastically than the other bands ( mainly d@xmath16 and d@xmath15 bands ) near fl . as a result d@xmath32 band ( being planer in nature )",
    "gets modified remarkably with increasing doping concentration .",
    "as a side remark we would like to mention that in fig .",
    "[ pbs ] ( g ) corresponding to @xmath33= 0.375 of p doping at the as site leads to a lifshitz transition as the planer d@xmath32 band about to cross the fl .",
    "clearly , with doping the d@xmath32 band intersects the fl ( the black solid line at zero ) at two closer and closer k - points , leading to the difference between the two k points @xmath34 , which corresponds to vanishing of the inner fs , carrying the vital signature of lifshitz transition .",
    "this subject is not in the purview of the present paper and interested readers may follow a detailed manifestations in ref .",
    "however , in case of k and na doping at ba site ( hole doping ) which is by nature an out of plane substitution , the planer d@xmath32 band near fl is comparatively less affected but there are notable moderations in the d@xmath16 as well as d@xmath15 bands near fl due to hole doping . from figs.[kbs ] , [ nabs ] , [ pbs ] , we calculate the band energies of d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 bands around all high symmetry k points : x , y , @xmath23 for k , na and p doped ba122 systems . in fig.[fefedop ] ,",

    "it has been explicitly shown that these band energies ( e@xmath0 and e@xmath1 ) follow the same behaviour as that of the two fe - fe bond lengths ( in the orthorhombic phase of these ba122 systems , there are two different fe - fe bond lengths indicating stripe sdw order ) as a function of doping concentration for k , na as well as p doped ba122 systems .",

    "although the case of iso - electronic ru doping at fe site is similar to the hole doping scenario where density of states at the fl follow the same doping variation as that of the fe - as bond length ; there is in general an universal link between the variation of density of states at the fl with that of the experimental z@xmath17 with doping and it turns out that z@xmath17 is inversely ( directly ) proportional to fe - as bond distances ( with exceptions of k doped bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ) for hole ( electron ) doped materials as a function of doping .",
    "now we shed more light into the universality and diversities in the behaviour of electronic structure and structural parameters of 122 fe based compounds . in plane and out of plane as - as distances also play very important and crucial role in controlling the electronic structures .",
    "first , we study the case of out of plane substitution _",
    "i.e. , _ k and na doping at ba site . size of the ba atom ( 2.22 ) [ atomic radius in metalic bonding ] is larger than na atom ( 1.86 ) but smaller than k atom ( 2.27 ) . because of this reason , with the substitution of k atom in place of ba atom , out of plane as - as distance increases and exactly opposite behaviour in the out of plane as - as distance",
    "is observed in the case of na substitution in ba site .",
    "it should also be noted that the c - axis increases with the increasing doping concentration for both na and k doping ( in case of na doped ba122 materials c - axis increases with doping up to certain doping concentration and after that it decreases ) .",
    "this qualitatively explains the observed behaviour of z@xmath17 with doping for k and na doped ba122 systems . on the other hand , in both the hole doped cases , in plane as - as distance decreases with increasing doping concentration following the doping variation of fe - as bond length .",
    "next we investigate the case of in plane substitutions ( co / ru substitution at fe site and p substitution at as site ) .",
    "size of fe atom ( 1.26 ) is smaller than ru atom ( 1.34 ) but larger than co atom ( 1.25 )",
    ". therefore , fe - as bond length decreases with co doping but increases with doping in case of ru substitution in place of fe .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of in - plane as well as out of plane as - as distances as a function of doping .",
    "since the size of p atom ( 1 ) is smaller than as atom ( 1.15 ) , fe - as bond length decreases with increasing doping concentration just like the case of co doped ( electron doped ) system .",
    "these are also consistent with the doping dependent variation of out of plane as - as distance ( in all the cases of in plane substitution c - axis decreases with increasing doping concentration ) . moreover , in plane as - as distance in all these cases ( in plane substitution ) follow the same doping dependencies as that of the fe - as bond length .",
    "thus all these structural parameters are crucially controlling the electronic structures near the fl of the 122 compounds and follow universal characteristics features . a shuttle dependence of chemical size",
    ", atomic number of the host / substituent , in - plane or out of plane nature of substitution determines `` aggregate electronic motion '' which is thus detrimental of electronic structure , band structure and fs .",
    "this governs various electronic properties of 122 fe - based materials like topological transition , magneto - structural transition , nematicity and possibly superconductivity @xcite",
    "a detailed first principles electronic structure calculation on a number of doped 122 family of fe - based scs are presented .",
    "experimentally rietveld refined structural parameters like lattice parameters ( @xmath49 ) together with z@xmath17 as a function of doping as well as temperature are used as fixed inputs in our calculations .",
    "various kinds of dopings like ; electron doping , hole doping , iso - electronic doping are considered ( within vca ) in this study .",
    "electronic band structure which essentially represent an aggregate electronic motion ( band motion ) carries the `` finger prints '' of any structural or magnetic modifications with temperature or doping .",
    "this physical aspect is used to calculate orbital ordering and various correlations of intrinsic structural parameters to electronic structure ( e.g , two fe - fe distances maps with e@xmath0 , e@xmath1 band energies , fe - as or z@xmath17 , as - as distances etc .",
    "to n(e@xmath48 ) ) .",
    "shuttle interplay of structural parameters with electronic structure is employed to explain as to why iso - electronic doping p in place of as and ru in place of fe corresponds to electron and hole dopings respectively .",
    "it has been shown very rigorously and quantitatively for a number of fe - based scs that the orbital ordering between the d@xmath15 , d@xmath16 orbitals is the origin of structural transition . the calculated orbital ordering from electronic structure calculations when normalized its variation with temperature as well as doping identically follows ( quantitatively ) with that of the experimental orthorhombicity parameter .",
    "this conclusively proves that the structural transition in 122 family of fe - based scs is not lattice driven but electronic one .",
    "therefore , our work supports the electronic origin of the nematic phase observed in 122 family of fe - based materials .",
    "an universal correlation among the structural parameters and the electronic structure is described in this work .",
