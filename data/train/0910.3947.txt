    "the x - ray spectrum of many active galactic nuclei ( agns ) exhibits a strong emission feature at an energy of 6.4  kev  that is due to the fluorescence of weakly ionized iron in a dense and relatively cold medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of the emission feature requires that the region responsible for the fluorescence subtend about half the sky as seen from the illuminating x - ray source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the variability properties of agn place the x - ray source within 10  schwarzschild radii from the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is likely that relativistic effects may alter the observed line shape @xcite allowing it to be a powerful probe of space - time curvature .",
    "several examples of relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath1  lines have been detected in the spectra of agns over the last decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these detections are leading to measurements of black hole spins and accretion disk dynamics @xcite .",
    "the strength of the fe line emission depends on only four parameters : ( i ) the shape of the illuminating continuum @xcite , which in agns is a power - law with photon index @xmath2 ; ( ii ) the abundance of iron ( relative to the solar value ) in the accretion disk @xcite , @xmath3 ; ( iii ) the ionization parameter of the illuminated disk @xcite , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the illuminating flux , and @xmath6 is the density of the illuminated slab ; and ( iv ) the reflection fraction @xmath7 , a measure of the relative strength of the reflection component in the observed spectrum ( this is related to the covering factor of the accretion disk ) .",
    "recently , multi - wavelength survey data has been able to measure correlations between each of the first three of these parameters to @xmath8 , the eddington ratio of agns @xcite . here , @xmath9 is the bolometric luminosity of an agn , and @xmath10  erg  s@xmath11 is the eddington luminosity of a black hole with mass @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the mass of the sun .",
    "in addition , various surveys have been able to measure the black hole mass distribution @xcite and its evolution with redshift @xcite , as well as the luminosity function of agns as a function of redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can then combine all this information to calculate the density and evolution of the fe  k@xmath1  line from accretion disks . in the following we concentrate solely on the fe  k@xmath1  line that arises from the inner accretion disk , and",
    "neglect the contribution from any narrow component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or one that arises from reflection off a compton - thick absorber ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the following @xmath14-dominated cosmology is assumed @xcite : @xmath15  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the 210  kev x - ray luminosity function measured by @xcite is used as the basis for the density and evolution of agns .",
    "we consider 261 x - ray luminosities between @xmath18 and @xmath19  erg  s@xmath11 , and assume a bolometric correction of @xmath20 to convert these to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass distribution at @xmath21 measured by @xcite is converted into 28 mass bins ( spanning @xmath22  @xmath13 to @xmath23  @xmath13 ) and normalized to sum to unity . applying this distribution to each of the 261 luminosities yields 261 eddington ratio distributions . at @xmath24",
    "the minimum and maximum eddington ratios are @xmath25 ( at a x - ray luminosity of @xmath18  erg  s@xmath11 ) and @xmath26 ( at a x - ray luminosity of @xmath19  erg  s@xmath11 ) , respectively . a constant density ionized reflection code is used to calculate the reflection continuum including the fe  k@xmath1  line @xcite . in these models , the density of the accretion disk is taken to be @xmath27  @xmath28 , and @xmath5 is changed in order to obtain the desired value of @xmath29",
    ". the observed relationships between @xmath29 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath30 @xcite are used to determine the input parameters for the the reflection code over a wide range of @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters are frozen at reasonable values was chosen for computational reasons , but , despite the rare example ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vast majority of agns have photon indices less than this value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] for very high or low values of @xmath30 .",
    "the relationships are : @xmath31 @xmath32 and    @xmath33    the fe  k@xmath1  equivalent width ( ew ) and line flux are measured for each @xmath30 and then averaged over the @xmath30-distribution to obtain mean values for that particular x - ray luminosity .",
    "the accretion disk is not expected to be optically thick to x - rays when @xmath34 @xcite , and in those cases the fe  k@xmath1line ew and line flux are set to zero ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even when @xmath35 , although other observations imply a more stable inner radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if such an effect occurs in agn disks , then the number density of relativistic lines from the lower @xmath30 sources will be reduced",
    ". however , there is currently no observational evidence of such an effect in seyfert galaxies or quasars . ] .",
    "these calculations are repeated for 40 different redshifts between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with the black hole mass distribution moving to larger masses as @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it is currently unknown where the x - ray source is located in relation to the accretion disk in agns , and so we consider two limiting cases for @xmath7 .",
    "the first is to assume @xmath39 , a commonly observed value in measurements of broad fe lines @xcite , for all calculations of the fe  k@xmath1  ew and line flux .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming the accretion disk subtends a solid angle of @xmath40 as viewed from the x - ray source .",
    "the illuminating power - law and reflection spectra are simply added together to form the @xmath39 spectra .",
    "the second case assumes that @xmath7 is inversely proportional to @xmath30 , which is a prediction of models of relativistic light bending in agns where the x - ray source is located on the axis of the central black hole @xcite .",
    "the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath30 is determined from the _ suzaku _ measurements of the seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15  that assumed a variable @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a black hole mass of @xmath41  m@xmath42 @xcite , and a 210  kev  bolometric correction of @xmath20 @xcite was used to calculate @xmath30 for the two states of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "a straight - line fit yielded : @xmath43 in both cases , the fe  k@xmath1  equivalent widths and line fluxes are computed by integrating over the total spectrum from @xmath44  kev  to @xmath45  kev . for the ew calculation ,",
    "the continuum underneath the line is estimated by fitting a straight line to the spectrum between those two energies . to calculate the line flux an emitting area from the disk had to be assumed . following the line emission model of @xcite",
    ", we assumed that each line was emitted from @xmath46@xmath44  @xmath47 with a flat emissivity index , and from @xmath44@xmath48  @xmath47 with an emissivity index of @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath50 is the gravitational radius of a black hole with mass @xmath12 , @xmath51 is the gravitational constant and @xmath52 is the speed of light .",
    "at any @xmath53 , multiplying the observed x - ray luminosity function by the slope of the computed luminosity - ew relationship results in the fe  k@xmath1 ew analogy to the agn luminosity function , which we call the fe  k@xmath1  ew function .",
    "figure  1 plots this function at four different redshifts .",
    "there are strong peaks in the @xmath39 function at ews of @xmath54  ev and @xmath55  ev at all redshifts that correspond to strong neutral and ionized fe  k@xmath1  lines , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the strongest peak in the light - bending model is at an ew of @xmath56  ev which corresponds to neutral line emission that is enhanced by strong reflection .",
    "the @xmath39 model indicates that fe  k@xmath1  lines with ews @xmath57  ev will dominate the space density at all redshifts , while the light - bending model predicts a significant space density of very strong fe  k@xmath1  lines with ews up to @xmath56  ev .",
    "each panel in fig .  1 also gives the average fe  k@xmath1  ew at the specified redshift for the two different models .",
    "the average ew for the @xmath39 model is @xmath58  ev for @xmath59 and then rises to @xmath60  ev at higher redshifts . in the extreme light - bending model , the average fe  k@xmath1",
    "ew is @xmath61  ev over the entire redshift range .",
    "figure 1 also shows a clear difference in the expected density of relativistic fe  k@xmath1  with ews @xmath62  ev between the @xmath39 and the light - bending models .",
    "although there exists up to a factor of 10 scatter in the observed relationships connecting @xmath2 , @xmath29 , @xmath3 and @xmath30 @xcite , this scatter could in no way explain the three order of magnitude difference between the @xmath39 and light - bending models .",
    "moreover , the decrease in high ew fe  k@xmath1  lines in the @xmath39 model is driven by the observed x - ray luminosity function .",
    "a recent compilation by @xcite found that the majority of broad fe  k@xmath1  components in nearby seyferts have ews less than 100  ev , in agreement with the fe  k@xmath1function for @xmath39 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the light - bending model predicts a space density of agns with fe  k@xmath1  ews @xmath62  ev that is 5@xmath63 larger than the @xmath39 model ( this ratio drops to @xmath64 at @xmath65 ) ; for ews @xmath66  ev the space - density is @xmath67 larger in the light - bending model ( this ratio drops to @xmath68 at @xmath65 ) .",
    "observations indicate that such intense lines are rare @xcite , despite the fact that they would be the easiest to detect .",
    "however , our calculations assumed only one disk - like reflector in an agn , but this may be violated for agns in certain states @xcite where multiple disk reflections can boost the observed ew .",
    "such a scenario seems to be required to explain the very large fe  k@xmath1  ew observed from 1h  0707 - 495 @xcite .",
    "the predicted sky density distribution of relativistic fe  k@xmath1  lines in the range @xmath36@xmath69 is shown in figure  2 .",
    "this plot dramatically illustrates that , in the @xmath39 scenario , agns with fe  k@xmath1  ews @xmath66  ev will be very rarely observed between @xmath36 and @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the x - ray source in agns is located above the black hole , as in the extreme light - bending model , then such large ews would be common , with sky densities of @xmath70  deg@xmath71 .",
    "if this model was generally true , then a near flat distribution of ews should be observed , while , in contrast , the majority of detected broad fe  k@xmath1  lines have ews@xmath72  ev @xcite , in agreement with the @xmath39 curve .",
    "the bottom line is that , unless extreme light - bending is increasing the value of @xmath7 , relativistic fe  k@xmath1  lines with ews  @xmath73  ev can only be produce by ionized accretion disks with large fe abundances .",
    "such a situation is most common when an agn has a large eddington ratio , and such agns are rare at @xmath59 .",
    "one can use these results to plan future fe  k@xmath1  line surveys performed by the proposed _ international x - ray observatory _ ( _ ixo _ ) .",
    "figure  3 plots the predicted sky density of fe  k@xmath1  lines greater than a certain line flux in agns between @xmath36 and @xmath74 .",
    "the plot shows that both the @xmath39 scenario and the extreme light - bending model predict that a small number of very bright lines with fluxes @xmath75  erg  cm@xmath71  s@xmath11 . for reference ,",
    "the fe  k@xmath1  line in the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15  is one of the brightest known and has a line flux of @xmath77  erg  cm@xmath71  s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this plot predicts that there should only be @xmath78 agns over the entire sky with fe  k@xmath1  lines that have fluxes equal to or greater than mcg6 - 30 - 15 , in agreement with the observed scarcity of such lines . at lower fluxes ,",
    "the predictions of the two models diverge with the difference approaching 2 orders of magnitude at fluxes of @xmath79  erg  cm@xmath71  s@xmath11 .",
    "such a difference will be easily distinguished by future surveys by _ ixo _ , but could be measured by a careful analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ archives .",
    "this work has shown , for the first time , the cosmic density and ew distribution of relativistic fe  k@xmath1  lines . sensitive observations of these line profiles are vital as they allow measurements of fundamental parameters such as the spin of the central black hole .",
    "our results validate the previous and current results from _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ that have shown that the majority of relativistic fe  k@xmath1  lines have ews@xmath0  ev @xcite . now that models of the intrinsic line ew and flux distributions are available , detailed planning of future fe  k@xmath1  surveys by _ ixo _ can be performed .",
    "the sensitivity of _ ixo _ will push spin measurements beyond the local universe and out to moderate redshifts , revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmic evolution of black holes .",
    "finally , we have shown that the extreme light - bending model predicts many more intense relativistic fe  k@xmath1  lines than the @xmath39 model ( figs . 1 and 2 ) , in disagreement with current observational constraints .",
    "this implies that , on average , the x - ray source in agns does not lie on the axis of the black hole where light - bending would be so extreme .",
    "it seems more likely that the x - ray source in average agns lies above the accretion disk at a radius of several @xmath47 from the black hole where light bending is less severe .",
    "comparing data from future surveys of fe  k@xmath1  lines with plots such as figure  3 should allow a measurement of the average radial displacement of the x - ray source .",
    "of course , this conclusion does not preclude the possibility that extreme light - bending occurs in a few rare sources .",
