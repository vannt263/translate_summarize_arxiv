    "notice this is a quite natural way to characterize a dynamical process : @xmath54 corresponds to a slow evolution , for which in principle an adiabatic dynamics could be achieved ; @xmath55 instead characterizes a fast evolution , for which adiabaticity is strictly forbidden . in fig .",

    "[ linear_scale_pic_fig ] , the speed - up we have obtained in our analysis is analogous to the speed - up reached through the grover s quantum adiabatic algorithm  @xcite , from a quadratic to a linear dependence on gap of the evolution time @xmath37 . in the case of the lmg model",
    "the gain is stronger , from a cubic to a linear dependence , outlining the fact that the limit of the optimization is set by a constant value of the action @xmath76 . as a last remark , from the previous discussion",
    "it can be argued that optimized evolutions achieve a substantial speed up only when the minimum gap closes polynomially with the size ; in the case of an exponential closure , even an optimized process leads to a total evolution time exponentially diverging with @xmath6  @xcite .",

    "the qsl then clearly identifies the threshold between fast and adiabatic evolutions .",
    "in conclusion , we estimated the time required by an optimized , non - adiabatic process to drive the ground state of a many - body system across a quantum phase transition .",
    "the behavior of the systems analyzed revealed to be surprisingly similar to that one of a simple 2-level system ; we explained the phenomenon through the connection with the intrinsic geometry of the hilbert space for pure state , interpreting the optimized process as an uniform motion along the geodesic connecting the initial and target states , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ l64_comparison_fig ] .",
    "this result is of particular relevance because establishes a direct link between quantum speed limit and fisher information  @xcite in the general setup of an evolution driven by a time dependent hamiltonian .",
    "we demonstrated that the qsl for the dynamical processes analyzed scales as the inverse of the critical gap , significantly improving the result obtained with a non optimized evolution .",
    "such a speed - up is a general feature and can be interpreted as the extension of the grover s algorithm speed - up to the models considered .",
    "finally , introducing the action @xmath77 , we provided a classification of the possible qpt dynamics .",

    "we acknowledge financial support by aqute , sfb trr21 , picc , solid and bw - grid for computational resources .",
    "in this appendix we provide an intuitive explanation for the scaling obtained in sec .  [",
    "classification : sec ] .",
    "the numerical results suggest that the optimized process is equivalent to perform a rotation of the initial state into the target at a constant angular speed @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the critical gap of the finite size many - body system in analysis . in a first approximation we can recast the full many - body problem into a 2-level effective model , described with a lz like hamiltonian @xmath87 $ ] , where the spin - up and spin - down states play respectively the role of the full many - body initial and target state and the tunability of the diagonal element @xmath30 mimics the possibility of selecting the instantanous rotational axis",
    ". considering fig.([qsl_persp_lz_lin_fig ] ) , intuitively one can expect that the initial state does not change significantly while its energy is much larger than the off - diagonal matrix elements , while viceversa , an efficient population transfer occurs when @xmath88 .",
    "therefore the total evolution can be approximated in two distinct regimes : a first one for @xmath89 in which @xmath90 and the initial state corresponds to the instantaneous gs .",
    "the second regime , for @xmath91 where the two levels are highly coupled and @xmath92 . the time @xmath93 marking the boundary between the two regimes is implicitely determined by the condition @xmath94 as shown in fig.([qsl_persp_lz_lin_fig ] ) . under this approximation",
    ", the optimization problem is now easily solved .",
    "it is indeed known that the fastest possible transition between two orthogonal states with a fixed overlap @xmath95 is obtained through a rabi oscillation , i.e. by applying @xmath96 for a time @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "the complete rotation is then possible if the condition @xmath98 holds , where @xmath93 is obtained solving eq.([condition ] ) .",
    "a linear time - dependence of the field , @xmath56 , gives @xmath99 , that is @xmath100 , implying @xmath101 .",
    "the optimization of the time dependence of @xmath30 corresponds to the extension of the region of high transition rate , then increasing @xmath93 : the best possible result is clearly @xmath102 , that is , the transformation is effective during the whole evolution . finally setting this condition ,",
