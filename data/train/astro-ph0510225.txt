    "over the past two decades , dynamical simulations of star clusters have become much more realistic .",
    "this realism takes the form of an increasingly complex treatment of individual stars in the cluster . for years , dynamical models only considered stars as single equal - mass points .",
    "the introduction of a mass function into dynamical models quickly necessitated some treatment of stellar evolution .",
    "high mass stars have much shorter lifetimes than low mass stars , mass loss from high mass stars can remove a significant fraction of the mass from the cluster , and very high mass stars can completely dominate the dynamical evolution of the cores of clusters @xcite .",
    "binary stars also have a substantial impact on the cluster dynamics , by acting as energy sinks or sources .",
    "it has been known for a long time that a single massive binary can dominate the evolution of star clusters @xcite .",
    "a hard binary system can produce cluster energy through an encounter with another system that leaves the binary system with a tighter orbit .",
    "encounters between soft binary systems and other objects can release the binary s binding energy to cool the cluster , whereas interactions with hard binaries effectively heat the cluster .",
    "dynamically produced binaries were recognized as a key population for halting core collapse @xcite .",
    "open clusters also have primordial binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and those binary systems can affect the cluster evolution from its birth .",
    "stellar dynamicists realized that the point mass approximation for stars was neglecting a number of dynamically significant processes in clusters .",
    "allowing stars to have radii that change as they evolve was an important next addition to stellar dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "finite stellar radii are most important for two aspects of these simulations .",
    "first , binary stars can undergo mass transfer as one member of the system fills its roche lobe , either through evolution of the star or dynamical modification of the orbital parameters of the system .",
    "changing binary systems will change how the binaries affect the evolution of the cluster . in the extreme case",
    ", the two components of the binary system can merge .",
    "secondly , stars with finite radii can collide with other stars , either through direct hyperbolic collisions ( in dense clusters ) or in highly eccentric binary systems created after close encounters .",
    "one of the earliest papers to show the dynamical importance of binary - single encounters was written 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "stellar collisions can produce blue stragglers @xcite and other non - standard stellar populations @xcite .",
    "these populations can in turn modify the dynamical evolution of the cluster .",
    "young , open clusters are of particular interest when simulating star clusters . because they tend to have a relatively small number of stars , open clusters provide observations that do not require prohibitive computational expense to reproduce .",
    "they also are well studied and the evolution of their stellar populations ( population i ) are well determined .",
    "some open clusters are young enough to have pre - main sequence stars that are observable ; indeed numerous authors have reported pre - main sequence stars in the pleiades for instance @xcite . for dynamicists ,",
    "open clusters showcase a variety of phenomenon that play an important role in the evolution of the cluster .",
    "the environment that typifies the core of such a cluster is dense enough to provide for a rather high ( and well known ) binary fraction , and collisions , mergers , and other encounters are expected .",
    "all of these factors make open clusters an excellent place to start when integrating stellar evolution with dynamics .",
    "a number of authors have endeavored to push the limits of realism in dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite start their simulations with 10000 - 15000 stars distributed via plummer and king models with varying fractions of binaries .",
    "they assign masses to these using stars using @xcite initial mass functions , and evolve them from the zero age main sequence using recipes detailed in @xcite .",
    "their model includes the effects of the galactic tidal field .",
    "because their study focused on blue stragglers , they included collisions and mergers as well as close encounters .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter pz01 ) start with 3072 stars all distributed using a king model , and using a @xcite mass function .",
    "their treatment of binary and stellar evolution is somewhat different from @xcite , and will be discussed in more detail in later sections of this paper .",
    "all previous work assumed that all stars began their lives on the zero age main sequence .",
    "however , low mass stars make up the bulk of stars in a cluster for any reasonable initial mass function .",
    "low mass stars also have a pre - main sequence lifetime that is a substantial fraction of the cluster lifetime , significantly influencing a cluster population .",
    "these young stars have radii which can be up to 10 times larger than their main sequence radii .",
    "therefore , some binaries could have undergone an episode of mass transfer that was hitherto not taken into account .",
    "also , larger stars are more likely to have experienced a collision ; those collision products will have been missed in previous simulations .",
    "including pre - main sequence evolution is regarded as a potentially important step in increasing the realism of stellar dynamics simulations @xcite .    in this paper , we explore the effect of including the pre - main sequence phase of stellar evolution in a stellar dynamics calculation .",
    "we look at the differences between simulations with and without the pre - main sequence in terms of global cluster properties ( density profile , dissociation time , etc . ) and in terms of the observable effect on the colour - magnitude diagram of the cluster .",
    "we look at the change in number and nature of unusual stellar populations and of the evolved stellar populations . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the dynamical method used and how we incorporated pre - main sequence evolution . in section 3",
    "we present our results , and discuss their implication in section 4 .",
    "for all our simulations , we use the starlab software environment , featuring the kira integrator @xcite and seba stellar and binary evolution package @xcite .",
    "the simulations were run using the grape-6 hardware @xcite .      in the interests of simulating observable results , we choose parameters corresponding to population i , young clusters .",
    "these clusters typically have approximately 1000 stars , and are no older than a few billion years .",
    "we ran three sets of three simulations with different realizations of the input parameters .",
    "our initial conditions mirror those of pz01 , except that in some cases , our stars begin on the pre - main sequence rather than the zero age main sequence . in order to effectively determine the degree that adding pre - main sequence evolution affects a cluster simulation",
    ", we use the same input snapshots for the first three w6 models of pz01 , with various modifications outlined below .    for the input snapshots ,",
    "pz01 begin the simulation with 2048 nodes ( single or binary stars ) set up with a @xcite model with a dimensionless depth ( @xmath0 ) of 6 , taking into account the velocity anisotropy and non - spherical shape that cluster would experience in the galactic tidal field similar to that of @xcite .",
    "the initial virial cluster radius was taken to be 2.5 pc .",
    "they then add a binary companion to every second node , for a total of 3072 stars .",
    "this is comparable to young clusters such as ngc 2516 and the pleiades .",
    "masses were applied to the nodes using a initial mass function prescribed by @xcite with masses ranging from 0.1  to 100 , and a mean mass @xmath1 0.6 .",
    "this yields an initial total mass of @xmath2 , which is similar to estimates for the hyades of @xcite .",
    "the masses for the secondary stars were selected randomly between 0.1  and the mass of the primary .",
    "the orbital eccentricities were selected from a thermal distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "the orbital separation @xmath3 was selected with a uniform probability in log @xmath3 , with a minimum separation of roche lobe contact or 1 , whichever is smaller .",
    "the maximum separation of the binaries was taken to be @xmath4 ( about 0.02 pc ) .",
    "note that the condition of roche lobe contact implicitly includes some dependence the initial radius of the star .",
    "finally , each star was assigned a radius , luminosity , and temperature based on their current evolutionary state .",
    "main sequence initial prescriptions for radius , temperature , and luminosity are given by @xcite .",
    "we added pre - main sequence attributes ( where applicable ) using the tracks obtained from @xcite .",
    "we labeled our simulations as ` pz - ms ' , ` pz - pms ' or ` rw - pms ' , with differences as follows . for our pz - ms runs ,",
    "the snapshots were identical to those used in pz01  the positions , velocities , masses and other stellar and binary parameters were not changed .",
    "these runs were used for comparison purposes , since all stars in this set of simulations began their lives on the zero age main sequence . for our pz - pms runs ,",
    "the positions , velocities , masses , and binary parameters were the same as those used in pz01 but all low mass stars ( @xmath5 ) were started on the pre - main sequence birthline rather than on the zero age main sequence .",
    "essentially the only initial condition that differed between the pz - ms and pz - pms runs was the stellar radius for low mass stars .",
    "the condition for chosing binary orbit separations was a limit based on roche lobe contact , but pre - main sequence stars have much larger radii than zero age main sequence stars .",
    "therefore , many of the binary systems in the pz - pms simulations were initially in contact . to address this issue , we also ran a third set of simulations ( rw - pms ) in which the positions , velocities and masses of stars were identical to pz01 , but the binary semi - major axes were re - assigned , with a limit based on roche lobe contact as determined by the pre - main sequence radii .",
    "for each set of initial conditions , we ran three different realizations , corresponding to the first three realizations reported in pz01 .",
    "where relevant , we label individual realizations as ` pz - pms1 ' , etc .    adding the pre - main sequence phase of evolution to the stars in our cluster highlights some confusion in dating clusters .",
    "what exactly is meant by an age of zero ?",
    "if the pre - main sequence phase is included , then low mass stars will reach the zero age main sequence at different times , all of which are later than the start of the simulation , which we define as @xmath6 . in pz01 , it was clear that @xmath6 corresponded to the moment when all stars are on the zero age main sequence . for our pre - main sequence simulations ,",
    "we take @xmath6 to be the moment when all stars are on the deuterium - burning birthline as defined by @xcite ( see section [ pmsev ] ) .",
    "the difference between these two implementations is dependent on the mass of star in question . when comparing ages from dynamical simulations to those determined from observations , it is important to understand how the observed ages were derived .",
    "the entire system is evolved , including the effects of dynamics , individual stellar evolution , and binary evolution . for a complete description of all the computational techniques ,",
    "the reader is directed to the descriptions of starlab , kira , and seba @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will concentrate on describing the numerical methods and parameters that were modified when we introduced the pre - main sequence phase of evolution .",
    "single star evolution from the zero age main sequence is based on the time - dependent mass - radius and mass - luminosity relations given by @xcite .",
    "these relations are valid for the evolution of solar - metallicity stars on the main sequence , subgiant branch or hertzsprung gap , giant branch , horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch .",
    "stars are immediately turned into inert remnants ( white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ) at the end of the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the effective temperature and bolometric correction can be calculated for each star from the mass , radius and luminosity .",
    "quantities such as core mass and mass loss due to a stellar wind are also parameterized , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the stars and binaries are computed with the seba binary population synthesis package ( see portegies zwart & verbunt , 1996 , sect . 2.1 with changes made in model b of portegies zwart & yungelson , 1998 ) . in this synthesis model the two stars in a binary are evolved synchronously updating each of the stars at regular intervals while keeping track of the changes to the orbital period and eccentricity .",
    "the simulation model includes various stability criteria for mass transfer , tidal circularization , the emission of gravitational waves , supernova explosions , etc .      for our pre - main sequence recipes",
    ", we looked to the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , a selection of which are shown in figure [ pmstracks ] .",
    "they give pre - main sequence tracks that begin with a fully convective protostar , and end just after hydrogen burning begins .",
    "their tracks have resolution in mass of 0.1 from 0.3 to 2 , higher mass resolution between 0.1 and 0.3 , and lower resolution between 2 and 7 .",
    "we used the tracks for a metallicity of @xmath7 ( i.e. solar metallicity , appropriate for young open clusters ) and used the portions of their tracks which begin at the pre - main sequence birthline described by @xcite and end at the zero age main sequence .",
    "we did not implement the pre - main sequence phase for stars with masses greater than 7  because these stars spend little or no time on the pre - main sequence .",
    "we combined all the tracks to create a lookup table in which we interpolated linearly through mass and age to find radius and temperature .",
    "although other pre - main sequence tracks exist @xcite , we chose to use the @xcite tracks .",
    "they have sufficient resolution and span the entire range of masses to which pre - main sequence evolution applies . since theoretical tracks from different authors differ amongst themselves it was important to be able to have enough data to infer the properties of the star for a given mass and age .",
    "the range of masses is quite appropriate since our initial mass function has a lower limit of 0.1 , and stars with masses higher than about 7 do not have a significant pre - main sequence phase .",
    "another reason we chose these tracks was that they had data for stellar radius and temperature that were easily manipulated .",
    "@xcite compare their tracks with others and find good correspondence with most other tracks , although there is still some debate concerning the form of very low ( @xmath8 ) mass pre - main sequence evolution .    beyond temperature ,",
    "radius and luminosity , a number of other parameters need to be specified for pre - main sequence stars .",
    "these parameters come in two categories : those dealing with single - star evolution , and those dealing with binary evolution .",
    "unfortunately , many of these parameters have not been determined for pre - main sequence stars . to make reasonable choices",
    ", we had to look to stars with similar composition ( main sequence ) or similar structure ( the large convective envelope of a giant ) to give us these other characteristics .",
    "for instance , the way that we chose to calculate the mass transfer and age rejuvenation from accreting binary star systems in starlab is similar to the main sequence recipes , but the parameters controlling mass transfer relations are based on the values for giant stars .",
    "similarly , we took the value for the radius of gyration to be that of giant stars . since pre - main sequence stars do not exhibit mass loss ( especially stars with masses less than 7 ) , we neglected stellar winds on the pre - main sequence .",
    "one of the major benefits of using the starlab environment is that there are prescriptions for mergers or collisions of varying types of stars .",
    "collisions and mergers can be distinguished in that a merger is a result of unperturbed binary evolution , and is preceded by a period of mass transfer .",
    "currently , the code does not treat collisions that do not result in a merged object , so at the moment when the two stars are replaced by a single star the result will depend only on the types of stars and their mass",
    ".    encounters involving main sequence and post - main sequence stars are described in pz01 .",
    "the merger of two main sequence stars is treated as conservative mass accretion from the less massive secondary to the more massive primary .",
    "this results in a rejuvenation of the star  which usually is observed as a blue straggler if the masses of the stars are large enough , or as a reasonably normal main sequence stars if the total mass of the new object is less than the current turnoff mass .",
    "the merger of other types of stars result in evolved stars or unusual objects , as warranted by the structure of the two stars involved in the collision .",
    "the treatment of encounters involving pre - main sequence stars was similar to the treatment of main sequence stars ",
    "when a pre - main sequence star collided with a more evolved star , the result was taken to be similar to the result of a main sequence star colliding with the same kind of star .",
    "for pre - main sequence / pre - main sequence collisions , the merged object was returned to the pre - main sequence birthline as its evolutionary state will be completely disrupted .",
    "these choices are in agreement with the results of the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite of collisions involving pre - main sequence stars .",
    "two of the most general functions that represent the time evolution of star cluster are its total mass and total number of particles versus time . the processes which can decrease the total number of cluster members are a merger between two stars , type ia supernovae ( which do not leave a remnant ) and the escape of a star from the system .",
    "stars may escape as a result of a mixture of influences : dynamical encounter with a binary , supernova kick , or removal by the galactic tidal field .",
    "figure [ mnvt ] shows the total number of stars ( where a binary system counts as 2 stars ) versus time for each set of runs .",
    "the largest effect is the large initial drop in the number of stars in the pz - pms runs ( dashed line ) .",
    "this has mainly to do with early mergers that occur within these clusters . in these runs ,",
    "all of the binaries that had a small orbital separation in the main sequence configuration are now in contact . as a result ,",
    "a large number of binaries merge immediately after initialization of the simulation .",
    "eventually , the evidence of this event is erased , and the number of remaining cluster members approaches that of the other series .",
    "the rw - pms runs experience a decreased number of mergers throughout the life of the cluster since the radii of the stars become smaller throughout the pre - main sequence lifetime , and may only reach a point of roche lobe overflow when one of the stars becomes a giant . as a result ,",
    "the rate of decrease of the number of stars for the rw - pms runs ( @xmath9 stars / myr ) is lower than the rate the pz - ms runs ( @xmath10 stars / myr ) , but with a very similar slope to the pz - pms runs ( @xmath11 stars / myr ) .",
    "the slopes were measured between 500 and 1500 myr .",
    "this dependence of the dynamical results on the initial binary merger rate highlights the most important conclusion of this paper .",
    "the inclusion of pre - main sequence stars in dynamical simulations affects only the binary properties of the system , and a consistent treatment of the pre - main sequence binary population is necessary .",
    "the evolution of the total mass of the cluster is driven by two processes .",
    "one is mass loss from stars via stellar winds , and the other is the escape of stars from the cluster .",
    "the differences caused by including the pre - main sequence phase are quite small , as shown in figure [ mnvt ] .",
    "the maximum difference between the total mass of the pz - ms run and both pre - main sequence runs is at most 6% .",
    ".number loss and mass loss at 1.5 gyr for all runs [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we investigated the effects of allowing stars to begin their lives on the pre - main sequence in dynamical simulations .",
    "we added pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks which begin at the deuterium - burning birthline , and end at the zero - age main sequence .",
    "stars with masses less than 7  in the dynamical simulations have their radii , luminosities , temperatures , and other properties determined by these tracks starting from the @xmath6 point of the dynamical simulation .",
    "we compared these simulations with standard ones in which all stars begin their lives on the zero age main sequence at @xmath6 .",
    "the dominant characteristic which distinguishes between our different initial conditions can be traced back to the number of mergers in the early stage of the cluster evolution . in the pz - pms runs ,",
    "a lot of the binaries begin in roche lobe contact , since the binary orbits are based on zero age main sequence radii , and pre - main sequence stars have much larger radii initially .",
    "these early pre - main sequence / pre - main sequence mergers show up as a decrease in the total number of stars , but an increase in average mass .",
    "this effect changes the mass function of the cluster , not only initially , but the effect continues to be noticed for quite a large portion of the cluster s lifetime ( many tens of initial half - mass relaxation times ) . on the other hand , since the stars in the rw - pms runs start at a greater separation , and since the initial pre - main sequence radius is the largest radius for a given star until it becomes a giant star , there is an absence of mergers in these runs .",
    "this increases the binary fraction , and affects the mass function as well .    in spite of the initial drop of total number of objects in the pz - pms models ,",
    "the time evolution of the total mass is not noticeably affected by the starting point of the stars .",
    "similarly , the total number of stars in both pms simulations seem to decrease at a slower rate than their pz - ms counterparts .",
    "this is due to a smaller number of escapers ejected from the cluster through an encounter .",
    "the inclusion of pre - main sequence evolution causes the stellar interactions to be less violent . during a binary star / single star interaction , accretion during the stellar encounter affects the ensuing binary parameters which in turn affects the resulting ejection velocity .",
    "indeed , the merger of close binaries ( as in the pz - pms runs ) or the absence of close binaries in the rw - pms runs should affect the cluster in the same way since binaries act as a heat sink for the total energy of the cluster .",
    "since the predominant form of binary that stars in these models will encounter is not very hard , the heat sinks of the cluster can absorb more , thus decreasing the energy available for other purposes .    in the rw - pms models very little circularization",
    "is observed .",
    "this is because the stars are contracting away from each other , and therefore can not maintain close proximity as required for circularization .",
    "the pz - pms runs contain the largest number of circularized binaries and has a tidal circularization period which best matches observations of the hyades .",
    "another item of note is the frequency of the different types of mergers .",
    "almost all of the mergers were due to the normal binary evolution in which a star s radius becomes large than its roche lobe .",
    "the two most frequent mergers in the pms runs are pre - main sequence / pre - main sequence and pre - main sequence / giant star mergers ( with the latter being more dominant in the rw - pms case ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of such collisions @xcite suggest that the result will be a larger pre - main sequence star in the former case , and a larger giant star in the latter case .",
    "there is a significant amount of future work that could be done in this area and could involve simulating other cluster configurations ( for instance , with more stars or in different tidal field ) .",
    "since pre - main sequence stars in very young clusters have been studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a focus on the first 100 myr of a simulation could be insightful .",
    "another avenue of research would be to perform population synthesis in order to better determine which initial distribution of binary parameters will result in the observed distribution of these parameters , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "both the choices for initial binary orbits in the rw - pms and pz - pms runs were quite simplistic and should be improved upon .",
    "there are two noteworthy pieces of astrophysics that we have completely neglected from these simulations .",
    "both are particularly relevant to the study of young clusters , particularly clusters significantly younger than the 600 myr hyades analogue we concentrated on here .",
    "the first topic is the inclusion of the gas out of which the stars in these clusters formed .",
    "we know from observations of star forming regions that there is a reasonably long period of time when both stars and gas co - exist , and are presumably interacting dynamically .",
    "we neglect that stage completely by starting with a stars - only king model .",
    "the second topic is the effect of circumstellar ( and circumbinary ) disks around the young stars in the cluster .",
    "interactions between stars with disks should be slightly different than interactions between stars without disks , and could modify our results . in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that the careful treatment of cluster initial conditions is important , and there are clearly other avenues for improvement as well .",
    "our conclusion from this study is that inclusion of the pre - main sequence phase of stellar evolution is critical for any simulations that wish to understand the properties of binary stars in stellar systems .",
