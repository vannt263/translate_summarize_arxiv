    "symmetry occurs in many constraint satisfaction problems .",
    "for example , in scheduling a round robin sports tournament , we may be able to interchange all the matches taking place in two stadia .",
    "similarly , we may be able to interchange two teams throughout the tournament . as a second example , when colouring a graph ( or equivalently when timetabling exams ) , the colours are interchangeable",
    ". we can swap red with blue throughout .",
    "if we have a proper colouring , any permutation of the colours is itself a proper colouring .",
    "problems may have many symmetries at once .",
    "in fact , the symmetries of a problem form a group . their action is to map solutions ( a schedule , a proper colouring , etc . ) onto solutions .",
    "symmetry is problematic when solving constraint satisfaction problems as we may waste much time visiting symmetric solutions .",
    "in addition , we may visit many ( failing ) search states that are symmetric to those that we have already visited .",
    "one simple but effective mechanism to deal with symmetry is to add constraints which eliminate symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately eliminating all symmetry is np - hard in general @xcite .",
    "however , recent results in parameterized complexity give us a good understanding of the source of that complexity . in this survey paper ,",
    "i summarize results in this area . for more background ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the ideas , we consider a simple problem from musical composition",
    ". the all interval series problem ( prob007 in csplib.org @xcite ) asks for a permutation of the numbers 0 to @xmath0 so that neighbouring differences form a permutation of 1 to @xmath0 . for @xmath1",
    ", the problem corresponds to arranging the half - notes of a scale so that all musical intervals ( minor second to major seventh ) are covered .",
    "this is a simple example of a graceful graph problem in which the graph is a path .",
    "we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem in @xmath2 variables with @xmath3 iff the @xmath4th number in the series is @xmath5 .",
    "one solution for @xmath6 is : @xmath7 the differences form the series : @xmath8 .",
    "the all interval series problem has a number of different symmetries .",
    "first , we can reverse any solution and generate a new ( but symmetric ) solution : @xmath9 second , the all interval series problem has a value symmetry as we can invert values .",
    "if we subtract all values in ( 1 ) from @xmath10 , we generate a second ( but symmetric ) solution : @xmath11 third , we can do both and generate a third ( but symmetric ) solution : @xmath12    to eliminate such symmetric solutions from the search space , we can post additional constraints which eliminate all but one solution in each symmetry class . to eliminate the reversal of a solution , we can simply post the constraint : @xmath13 this eliminates solution ( 2 ) as it is a reversal of ( 1 ) . to eliminate the value symmetry which subtracts all values from @xmath10",
    ", we can post : @xmath14 this eliminates solutions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . finally , eliminating the third symmetry where we both reverse the solution and subtract it from @xmath10 is more difficult .",
    "we can , for instance , post : @xmath15   & \\leq_{\\rm lex } &   [ 10-x_{11 } , \\ldots , 10-x_{1}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that of the four symmetric solutions given earlier , only ( 4 ) with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfies all three sets of symmetry breaking constraints : ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "the other three solutions are eliminated .",
    "we will need some formal notation to present some of the more technical results . a _ constraint satisfaction problem _ ( csp ) consists of a set of variables , each with a finite domain of values , and a set of constraints @xcite .",
    "each _ constraint _ is specified by the allowed combinations of values for some subset of variables .",
    "for example , @xmath19 is a binary constraint which ensures @xmath20 and @xmath21 do not take the same values .",
    "global constraint _ is one in which the number of variables is not fixed .",
    "for instance , the global constraint @xmath22,n)$ ] ensures that @xmath2 variables , @xmath23 to @xmath24 , take @xmath25 different values @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath26 .",
    "constraint solvers typically use backtracking search to explore the space of partial assignments .",
    "after each assignment , constraint propagation algorithms prune the search space by enforcing local consistency properties like domain or bound consistency .",
    "a constraint is _ domain consistent _",
    "( _ dc _ ) iff when a variable is assigned any of the values in its domain , there exist compatible values in the domains of all the other variables of the constraint .",
    "such values are called a _",
    "support_. a csp is domain consistent iff every constraint is domain consistent .",
    "recently , bessiere _",
    "_ have shown that a number of common global constraints are intractable to propagate @xcite .",
    "for instance , enforcing domain consistency on the  constraint is np - hard @xcite .",
    "parameterized complexity can provide a more fine - grained view of such results , identifying more precisely what makes a global constraint ( in)tractable .",
    "we will say that a problem is _ fixed - parameter tractable _",
    "( _ fpt _ ) if it can be solved in @xmath27 time where @xmath28 is _ any _ computable function , @xmath29 is some parameter , @xmath30 is a constant , and @xmath2 is the size of the input .",
    "for example , vertex cover ( `` given a graph with @xmath2 vertices , is there a subset of vertices of size @xmath29 or less that cover each edge in the graph '' ) is np - hard in general , but fixed - parameter tractable with respect to @xmath29 since it can be solved in @xmath31 time @xcite .",
    "hence , provided @xmath29 is small , vertex cover can be solved effectively .",
    "as we have argued , symmetry is a common feature of many real - world problems that dramatically increases the size of the search space if it is not factored out .",
    "symmetry can be defined as a bijection on assignments that preserves solutions .",
    "the set of symmetries form a group under the action of composition .",
    "we focus on two special types of symmetry .",
    "a _ value symmetry _ is a bijective mapping , @xmath32 of the values such that if @xmath33 is a solution then @xmath34 is also .",
    "for example , in our all interval series example , there is a value symmetry @xmath32 that maps the value @xmath4 onto @xmath35 .",
    "a _ variable symmetry _",
    ", on the other hand , is a bijective mapping , @xmath36 of the indices of variables such that if @xmath33 is a solution then @xmath37 is also .",
    "for example , in our all interval series example , there is a variable symmetry @xmath36 that maps the index @xmath4 onto @xmath38 .",
    "this swaps the variable @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "a simple and effective mechanism to deal with symmetry is to add constraints to eliminate symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is very simple .",
    "we pick an ordering on the variables , and then post symmetry breaking constraints to ensure that the final solution is lexicographically less than any symmetric re - ordering of the variables .",
    "that is , we select the `` lex leader '' assignment . for example , to break the variable symmetry @xmath36 , we post the constraint : @xmath41   & \\leq_{\\rm lex } &   [ x_{\\theta(1 ) } , \\ldots , x_{\\theta(n)}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] efficient inference methods exist for propagating such constraints @xcite .",
    "the symmetry breaking constraints in our all interval series example can all be derived from such lex leader constraints .    in theory",
    ", the lex leader method solves the problem of symmetries , eliminating all symmetric solutions and pruning many symmetric states .",
    "unfortunately , the set of symmetries might be exponentially large ( for example , in a graph @xmath29-colouring , there are @xmath42 symmetries ) .",
    "there may therefore be too many symmetry breaking constraints to post .",
    "in addition , decomposing symmetry breaking into many lex leader constraints typically hinders propagation .",
    "we focus on three special but commonly occurring cases where symmetry breaking is more tractable and propagation can be more powerful : value symmetry , interchangeable values , and row and column symmetry . in each case , we identify islands of tractability but show that the quick - sands of intractability remain close to hand .",
    "value symmetries are a commonly occurring symmetry that are more tractable to break @xcite . for instance , puget has proved that a linear number of symmetry breaking constraints will eliminate any number of value symmetries in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "given a set of value symmetries @xmath43 , we can eliminate all value symmetry by posting the global constraint @xmath44)$ ] @xcite .",
    "this is a conjunction of lex leader constraints , ensuring that , for each @xmath45 : @xmath46    unfortunately , enforcing domain consistency on this global constraint is np - hard .",
    "however , this complexity depends on the number of symmetries . breaking all value symmetry is fixed - parameter tractable in the number of symmetries .",
    "enforcing domain consistency on @xmath44)$ ] is np - hard in general but fixed - parameter tractable in @xmath47 .",
    "* proof :  * np - hardness is proved by theorem 1 in @xcite , and fixed - parameter tractability by theorem 7 in @xcite .    one situation where we may have only a small number of symmetries",
    "is when we focus on just the _ generators _ of the symmetry group @xcite .",
    "this is attractive as the size of the generator set is logarithmic in the size of the group , many algorithms in computational group theory work on generators , and breaking just the generator symmetries has been shown to be effective on many benchmarks @xcite . in general , breaking just the generators may leave some symmetry .",
    "however , on certain symmetry groups ( like that for interchangeable values considered in the next section ) , all symmetry is eliminated ( theorem 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "by exploiting special properties of the value symmetry group , we can identify even more tractable cases .",
    "a common type of value symmetry with such properties is that due to interchangeable values .",
    "we can break all such symmetry using the idea of value _ precedence _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , we can post the global symmetry breaking constraint @xmath48)$ ] .",
    "this ensures that for all @xmath49 : @xmath50 that is , the first time we use @xmath5 is before the first time we use @xmath29 for all @xmath49 .",
    "for example , consider the assignment : @xmath51 this satisfies value precedence as 1 first occurs before 2 , 2 first occurs before 3 , etc .",
    "now consider the symmetric assignment in which we swap @xmath52 with @xmath53 : @xmath54 this does not satisfy value precedence as @xmath53 first occurs before @xmath52 .",
    "a  constraint eliminates all symmetry due to interchangeable values . in @xcite",
    ", we give a linear time propagator for enforcing domain consistency on the  constraint . in @xcite",
    ", we argue that @xmath55 can be derived from the lex leader method ( but offers more propagation by being a global constraint ) .",
    "another way to ensure value precedence is to map onto dual variables , @xmath56 which record the first index using each value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this transforms value symmetry into variable symmetry on the @xmath56 .",
    "we can then eliminate this variable symmetry with some ordering constraints : @xmath57 in fact , puget proves that we can eliminate _ all _ value symmetry ( and not just that due to value interchangeability ) with a linear number of such ordering constraints .",
    "unfortunately , this decomposition into ordering constraints hinders propagation even for the tractable case of interchangeable values ( theorem 5 in @xcite ) . indeed , even with _",
    "just _ two value symmetries , mapping into variable symmetry can hinder propagation .",
    "this is supported by the experiments in @xcite where we see faster and more effective symmetry breaking with the global  constraint .",
    "this global constraint thus appears to be a promising method to eliminate the symmetry due to interchangeable values .",
    "a generalization of the symmetry due to interchangeable values is when values partition into sets , and values within each set ( but not between sets ) are interchangeable .",
    "the idea of value precedence can be generalized to this case @xcite .",
    "the global @xmath58 constraint ensures that values in each interchangeable set occur in order .",
    "more precisely , if the values are divided into @xmath59 equivalence classes , and the @xmath5th equivalence class contains the values @xmath60 to @xmath61 then @xmath58 ensures @xmath62 for all @xmath63 and @xmath64 . enforcing domain consistency on @xmath58",
    "is np - hard in general but fixed - parameter tractable in @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "another common type of symmetry where we can exploit special properties of the symmetry group is row and column symmetry @xcite .",
    "many problems can be modelled by a matrix model involving a matrix of decision variables @xcite",
    ". often the rows and columns of such matrices are fully or partially interchangeable @xcite .",
    "for example , the equidistant frequency permutation array ( efpa ) problem is a challenging combinatorial problem in coding theory .",
    "the aim is to find a set of @xmath66 code words , each of length @xmath67 such that each word contains @xmath68 copies of the symbols 1 to @xmath69 , and each pair of code words is at a hamming distance of @xmath70 apart .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , one solution is : @xmath75 this problem has applications in communications , and is closely related to other combinatorial problems like finding orthogonal latin squares .",
    "_ @xcite consider a simple matrix model for this problem with a @xmath66 by @xmath67 array of variables , each with domains @xmath76 to @xmath69 .",
    "this model has row and column symmetry since we can permute the rows and the columns of any solution .",
    "although breaking all row and column symmetry is intractable in general , it is fixed - parameter tractable in the number of columns ( or rows ) .    with a @xmath2 by @xmath77 matrix , checking lex leader constraints that break all row and column symmetry is np - hard in general but fixed - parameter tractable in @xmath78 .",
    "* proof :  * np - hardness is proved by theorem 3.2 in @xcite , and fixed - parameter tractability by theorem 1 in @xcite .    note that the above result only talks about _ checking _ a constraint which breaks all row and column symmetry .",
    "that is , we only consider the computational cost of deciding if a complete assignment satisfies the constraint .",
    "propagation of such a global constraint is computationally more difficult .    just row or column symmetry on their own are tractable to break . to eliminate all row symmetry we can post lexicographical ordering constraints on the rows .",
    "similarly , to eliminate all column symmetry we can post lexicographical ordering constraints on the columns .",
    "when we have both row and column symmetry , we can post a @xmath79 constraint that lexicographically orders both the rows and columns @xcite . this does not eliminate all symmetry since it may not break symmetries which permute both rows and columns .",
    "nevertheless , it is more tractable to propagate and is often highly effective in practice .",
    "note that @xmath79 can be derived from a _ strict _ subset of the  constraints . unfortunately propagating such a  constraint",
    "completely is already np - hard .    with a @xmath2 by @xmath77 matrix , enforcing domain consistency on @xmath79 is np - hard in general .",
    "* proof :  * see threorem 3 in @xcite .",
    "there are two special cases of matrix models where row and column symmetry is more tractable to break .",
    "the first case is with an all - different matrix , a matrix model in which every value is different .",
    "if an all - different matrix has row and column symmetry then the lex - leader method ensures that the top left entry is the smallest value , and the first row and column are ordered @xcite .",
    "domain consistency can be enforced on such a global constraint in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "the second more tractable case is with a matrix model of a function .",
    "in such a model , all entries are 0/1 and each row sum is 1 .",
    "if a matrix model of a function has row and column symmetry then the lex - leader method ensures the rows and columns are lexicographically ordered , the row sums are 1 , and the sums of the columns are in decreasing order @xcite .",
    "domain consistency can also be enforced on such a global constraint in polynomial time @xcite .",
    "the study of computational complexity in constraint programming has tended to focus on the structure of the constraint graph ( e.g. especially measures like tree width @xcite ) or on the semantics of the constraints ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , these lines of research are mostly concerned with constraint satisfaction problems as a whole , and do not say much about individual ( global ) constraints . for global constraints of bounded arity , asymptotic analysis has been used to characterize the complexity of propagation both in general and for constraints with a particular semantics . for example",
    ", the generic domain consistency algorithm of @xcite has an @xmath80 time complexity on constraints of arity @xmath2 and domains of size @xmath70 , whilst the domain consistency algorithm of @xcite for the @xmath2-ary constraint has @xmath81 time complexity .",
    "_ showed that many global constraints like  are also intractable to propagate @xcite .",
    "more recently , samer and szeider have studied the parameterized complexity of the  constraint @xcite .",
    "szeider has also studied the complexity of symmetry in a propositional resolution calculus @xcite .",
    "see chapter 10 in @xcite for more about symmetry of propositional systems .",
    "we have argued that parameterized complexity is a useful tool with which to study symmetry breaking . in particular , we have shown that whilst it is intractable to break all symmetry completely , there are special types of symmetry like value symmetry and row and column symmetry which are more tractable to break . in these case ,",
    "fixed - parameter tractability comes from natural parameters like the number of generators which tend to be small . in future",
    ", we hope that insights provided by such analysis will inform the design of new search methods . for example",
    ", we might build a propagator that propagates completely when the parameter is small , but only partially when it is large . in the longer term , we hope that other aspects of parameterized complexity like kernels will find application in the domain of symmetry breaking .",
