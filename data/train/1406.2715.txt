    "spin - orbit coupling , present whenever electrons move in a strong electric field , has recently been playing a more prominent role in electronics .",
    "when spin - orbit coupling is present , broken inversion symmetry lifts the two - fold spin - degeneracy of bloch states in a crystal .",
    "for example , as pointed out by rashba@xcite , spin - orbit coupling produces spin - splitting at surfaces and at interfaces between different materials . in spintronics ,",
    "rashba spin - orbit coupling can provide a handle for electrical control of spin since its strength and character depends not only on atomic structural asymmetry but also on external gate voltages@xcite , allowing for the possibility of a spin - based field - effect transistor.@xcite alternately , spin - splitting due to rashba spin - orbit coupling in proximity coupled nanowires can lead to topological superconductivity and majorana edge states @xcite , which can provide an attractive hilbert space for quantum state manipulation for the purpose of quantum information processing .    because spin - orbit coupling does not conserve spin ,",
    "one of its most important consequences in spintronics is its role in providing a mechanism for relaxation of non - equilibrium spin densities . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , total charge and",
    "all three components of total spin are conserved .",
    "spin relaxation mechanisms due to spin - orbit coupling can be classified into two types : the elliott ",
    "yafet ( ey ) mechanism,@xcite where skew - scattering due to spin - orbit interactions with scattering centers is the the most obvious spin - relaxation process , and the more subtle but equally important dyakonov  perel ( dp ) mechanism,@xcite in which the momentum - dependent spin - orbit effective magnetic fields responsible for spin - splitting of the bloch states cause spin - precession between collisions . the dp spin relaxation mechanism is often dominant in spintronics , and can cause subtle interplays between charge and spin transport.@xcite    , the sum of the two incoming momenta , is close to zero .",
    "the interference is constructive in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , enhancing back scattering and suppressing the diffusion constant and the conductivity , but can be destructive and enhance the conductivity when spin - orbit is present.,width=226 ]    spin relaxation has an important indirect effect on the quantum contribution to the conductivity . in weakly disordered metallic systems with no spin - orbit coupling , backscattering is enhanced by constructive interference between time - reversed paths ( see fig.[fig : paths ] ) yielding a negative quantum correction to the classical conductivity calculated from drude s formula .",
    "this effect is referred to as weak localization ( wl ) .",
    "@xcite in two - dimensional systems , wl acts as a precursor to the transition into the anderson insulator state in which disorder is sufficiently strong to localize electrons . when the spin degree - of - freedom is accounted for in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , spin - degeneracy multiplies the conductivity correction by a factor of two . in general",
    "there are four two - particle spin states which contribute to the interference .",
    "when parsed in terms of total spin eigenstates , interference between time - reversed paths is constructive for the three triplet channels , but destructive for the singlet channel because of the berry phase contributed by rotation of the spin wave function along the path , recovering the factor of two enhancement .",
    "spin relaxation changes this situation .",
    "because the spin - density present in the triplet channels relaxes their contribution to the conductivity , the correction is reduced when spin - orbit coupling is present , whereas the singlet channel is unaffected due to charge conservation .",
    "when this effect is strong , either due to strong spin - orbit coupling or due to long phase coherence times , the quantum contribution becomes positive . in this case",
    "the quantum correction is referred to as weak antilocalization ( wal ) .",
    "wl and wal can be identified by studying the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the conductivity , since these parameters limit the phase coherence length @xmath2 , the characteristic length within which electrons can propagate without losing their phase coherence .",
    "the theory of wal onset was developed microscopically by hikami , larkin and nagaoka ( hln ) using a model with ey spin - relaxation,@xcite and later macroscopically using a nonlinear @xmath3-model approach @xcite which demonstrated that the effect depends mainly on global symmetries and not on microscopic details .",
    "iordanskii , lyanda - geller and pikus ( ilp ) later were the first to point out that dp spin relaxation also leads to wal , and that the triplet channels contribution is modified compared to that implied by the ey mechanism.@xcite wal induced by dp spin relaxation has been identified as responsible for negative magnetoconductivity in quantum wells @xcite and in topological insulator surface states.@xcite a recent experiment on transport at the interface between @xmath4 ( lao ) and @xmath5 ( sto ) has demonstrated that a wl - wal crossover can be induced by gate voltage modulation.@xcite .    motivated partly by the experiments in lao / sto heterostructures , we attempt to investigate in detail the dependence of wl and wal transport contributions on spin - orbit coupling strength across the crossover between resolved spin - splitting ( where disorder broadening is much smaller that spin - orbit coupling ) and spin - splitting obscured by disorder , by tuning the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength in a two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) .",
    "this crossover is controlled by a competition between two energy scales : the bloch state spin - splitting @xmath1 induced by spin - orbit coupling in systems without inversion symmetry , and the bloch state energy uncertainty @xmath6 due to the finite lifetime of bloch states in a disordered system .",
    "the asymptotic behavior in the extreme cases is obvious from the arguments we have summarized briefly above . in the band - unresolved limit @xmath7 we can apply ilp s analysis@xcite by taking spin - orbit coupling into account perterbatively . in this limit wal",
    "emerges from wl behavior in the long - phase coherence limit .",
    "on the other hand , in the band - resolved limit @xmath8 , only the spin singlet channel contributes to quantum interference and we obtain perfect wal behavior . what we intend to investigate here is the behavior in the intermediate regime @xmath9 . for this purpose",
    ", we have developed tools which enable us to investigate spin - relaxation and diffusion , and to evaluate quantum corrections to boltzmann transport at any value of @xmath10 .",
    "we have found that for a two - dimensional electron - gas model with rashba spin - orbit interactions , spin relaxation in the intermediate regime can not be simply described by ilp s picture .",
    "spin relaxation is partially suppressed by interference between channels , leading to a new plateau on which the wl / wal behavior is relatively insensitive to spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "we suggest that such a behavior can be confirmed experimentally by tuning the spin - orbit coupling with gate voltage and fixing other parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we explain how we evaluate the low - energy long - wavelength limit of the electron - pair ( cooperon ) propagator treating spin - orbit coupling and spin - relaxation it producees nonperturbatively . in section [ sec : matrixelements ] , we discuss our numerical results for the cooperon of the rashba model , and calculate the spin relaxation lengths for each triplet channel in order to characterize spin relaxation behavior across the crossover between the spin - resolved and unresolved limits . using the spin - relaxation characteristics we have calculated , we summarize the wl - wal crossover in section [ sec : results ] , constructing a phase diagram in the @xmath1-@xmath6 plane which identifies three regimes : perfect wl , perfect wal , and an intermediate plateau regime .",

    "the other three channels give @xmath17-dependent negative contributions .",
    "we can see that the intermediate plateau structure comes from channels 1 and 2 , which have imaginary relaxation lengths in the intermediate regime . comparing this structure with the behavior of the complex coherence lengths illustrated in fig.[fig : coherence - length ] , we conclude that the crossover from the intermediate plateau to the perfect wal plateau occurs when @xmath138 becomes real .",

    "we therefore plot the @xmath2-dependence of the quantum correction ratio @xmath174 in fig.[fig : density2 ] . in this figure",
    "we see that the weak @xmath1-dependence of @xmath174 in the intermediate region commented on previously appears as a crossover from wl to wal with increasing @xmath2 that is more rapid than in the standard simplified model with phenomenological triplet channel spin - lifetimes .",

    "the intermediate and perfect wal plateaus appear in this illustration as regions with densely packed lines .",
    "the slope as a function of @xmath2 turns from negative ( wl ) to positive ( wal ) around @xmath193 , and the behavior at that length scale is unconventional for intermediate spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "however , we should note that it could be difficult to distinguish the intermediate plateau from the perfect wal plateau by performing magneto - resistance / conductance measurements , since these measure the difference between @xmath194 and @xmath195 , where the latter is the value of @xmath2 in the case with no magnetic field .",
    "note however that the wal differential behavior is conventional for @xmath196 , so that a relatively strong magnetic field might be necessary to observe unconventional magneto - resistance and this might give rise to other effects , such as classical magnetoresistance or shubnikov  de haas oscillation . since the classical conductivity is insensitive to the spin - orbit coupling strength as long as @xmath125 , measurements of the @xmath17-dependence at fixed temperature and magnetic field might be able to distinguish the two plateaus and might be possible if @xmath17 is tuned by varying the electric field at fixed carrier density in a two - dimensional sample with both front and back gates .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the crossover behavior between wl and wal in a two - dimensional electron gas that is triggered by variation of the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "we have used a numerical approach to evaluate the cooperon contribution to the conductivity , assuming only that the energy - uncertainty of bloch states @xmath6 due to disorder scattering is small compared to the fermi energy and treating spin - orbit coupling in a non - perturbative fashion . for this reason we are able to evaluate quantum corrections to the conductivity for any value of the ratio of the rashba spin - splitting to disorder broadening @xmath6 ; an approach applicable beyond the band - unresolved limit when @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , there is no trace of the double degeneracy and each band contributes independently to the conductivity . in this limit ,",
    "the system exhibits perfect wal behavior , where the quantum interference for spin triplet combinations quickly vanishes within the order of the mean free path . in the strong spin - orbit coupling limit",
    ", the cooperon has the same structure as that for the 2d dirac hamiltonian , since the band eigenstates of the two models are identical . on the other hand , when @xmath197 , a mixing between two spin triplet particle - hole channels at first order in a long - wavelength expansion is present , which has been previously identified as an important feature of spin diffusion @xcite .",
    "here we show that this coupling has profound effect on quantum corrections to conductivity . in this regime",
    "the spin relaxation length becomes imaginary when different channels are strongly coupled , suppressing the damping of quantum interference corrections to conductivity . as a result",
    ", a new plateau - like region appears near the @xmath198 line when the maximally crossed diagrams are evaluated as a function of spin - orbit coupling strength at fixed phase coherence length .",
    "although it seems difficult to identify these two plateaus by the investigation of the differential behavior by @xmath2 , like the magneto - resistance / conductance measurement under a finite magnetic field , we suggest that they can be distinguished by tuning the spin - orbit coupling strength by an external gate voltage and fixing the coherence length ( temperature and magnetic field ) .",
    "although we have limited our attention here to a simple model with spin - independent disorder scattering and a single spin - split band that has circularly symmetric fermi surfaces , the numerical approach we have taken is readily generalized to an arbitrary band model and to models with spin - dependent disorder scattering .",
    "dealing with anisotropy requires only that an angular average over the fermi surface be added to sums over band state labels .",
    "qualitative aspects of the rashba model results reported on here apply to other two - dimensional electron systems with broken inversion symmetry . for two - dimensional electron systems , inversion symmetry can usually be varied _ in situ _ by tuning gate voltages . for any two - dimensional electron system without inversion symmetry ,",
    "the double spin - degeneracy of the bloch bands is lifted by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "when the spin - splitting @xmath199 is larger than the bloch state energy uncertainty @xmath6 , the spin - split bands can be viewed as distinct independent bands with momentum - dependent spin - orientations .",
    "it follows that in this regime , the spin - relaxation length is on the order the mean - free path , _",
    "i.e. _ spin - memory is lost at every collision .",
    "once this occurs we do not expect to see a crossover from wal to wl when the phase length @xmath2 is decreased by increasing the magnetic field or decreasing temperature . at weaker spin - orbit coupling strengths we do expect to see wl at some temperatures and fields .",
    "however , our study shows that the way in which a wl regime emerges at weaker spin - orbit coupling can be nontrivial and is determined by specific features of the band structure of a particular system",
    ".    one potentially interesting application of our approach is to two - dimensional electron gases formed at oxide heterojunctions , for instance to the @xmath200 electron - gas systems at the interface between laalo@xmath201 and srtio@xmath201 .",
    "the presence in this case of three different orbitals , each of which can have fermi surfaces , might make the spin relaxation scenario rich @xcite .",
    "it is known that rashba spin - orbit splitting in these systems @xcite is strongest near the avoided crossing between two higher energy ( lower density ) elliptical @xmath202 subbands and a lower energy ( higher density ) @xmath203 subband .",
    "there are indeed indications that magnetoresistive transport anomalies occur when the fermi level is near these weakly avoided crossings @xcite .",

    "spin - orbit coupling and band spin - splitting is particularly strong in the valence bands of this class of materials .",
