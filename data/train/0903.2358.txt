    "the calculation of hadron masses is one of the central subjects in lattice qcd since it gives us the opportunity to study such nonperturbative quantities from first principles .",
    "the results of such calculations ( with their proper extrapolations ) can then be compared directly to experiment .",
    "this allows us to clarify the internal structure of experimentally known resonances and also enables us to predict masses and properties of states which have not yet been found .",
    "since the precise nature of many hadron resonances is unknown , lattice qcd calculations provide an indispensable contribution to their understanding .",
    "however , this is not the only reason why hadron masses are the subject of very intensive studies in lattice qcd . a second",
    ", more technical reason is that we want to know to what extent our calculations are affected by systematic errors , which are usually connected to limited computer resources .",
    "the calculation of hadron masses gives us the possibility to study these systematics of our formulation by allowing us to compare our results directly with precise experimental measurements .",
    "while it is well understood how to extract the mass of the ground state in a given channel , a clean extraction of the masses of excited states in a lattice qcd calculation is still a challenge .",
    "one of the main difficulties is the fact that excited states only appear as subleading exponentials in euclidean two - point correlation functions . to extract them",
    ", a variety of approaches has been tried .",
    "they reach from brute - force multiexponential fits @xcite to more sophisticated techniques using bayesian priors methods @xcite and  nmr - inspired blackbox ",
    "methods @xcite .",
    "even evolutionary algorithms have been considered @xcite .",
    "a number of these methods have been studied and compared in @xcite . however , probably the most powerful technique is the variational approach @xcite , which is also the method we use for our studies . in this approach one",
    "studies not only a single correlator but a whole matrix of correlation functions .",
    "to access the crucial information contained in this matrix , a rich enough basis of interpolating operators ( i.e. , products of creation and annihilation operators with the correct quantum numbers , which have good overlap with the hadron wave function on the lattice ) has to be constructed .",
    "for that purpose we follow a strategy which already has been very successful in quenched simulations @xcite : we construct quark sources of different spatial shapes and then construct a large number of interpolators from these sources . as in the quenched case , by using two different gauge covariant smearings , we can mimic radial excitations .",
    "in addition we augment our basis with ",
    "p - wave sources  , i.e. , sources which should have overlap with orbital excitations .",
    "previous work on excited and high spin mesons in the light quark sector can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite for quenched calculations and in refs .",
    "@xcite for the dynamical case .",
    "preliminary results of this investigation were presented in @xcite .",
    "these studies are accompanied by similar ones on quenched lattices with chirally improved fermions @xcite .",
    "in addition to these excitations in the low spin sector , we perform an exploratory study of mesons with spin 2 and 3 .    in the following sections , we discuss the methods which we use to create the interpolators for our simulations and for extracting the excited states .",
    "then , after briefly describing the details of the simulations , we present our findings for the meson spectrum .",
    "we give reasons for our choices of fit ranges and the expressions we have used for the chiral extrapolations . in the end",
    "we summarize our results for these channels and compare them to experimental values .",
    "all numerical details of our results are summarized at the end of this paper .",
    "our calculation of the excited states of spin-0 and spin-1 mesons is based upon the variational method @xcite .",
    "the idea is to use several different interpolators @xmath5 with the quantum numbers of the desired state and to compute all cross correlations @xmath6 in hilbert space these correlators have the decomposition @xmath7 using the factorization of the amplitudes one can show @xcite that the eigenvalues @xmath8 of the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath9 behave as @xmath10 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the energy of the @xmath12-th state and @xmath13 is the difference to the energy closest to @xmath14 @xcite . for a more detailed discussion of the error terms",
    "see @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ generalized ] ) the eigenvalue problem is normalized with respect to a time slice @xmath15 .      at this point",
    "we mention two other remarkable properties of the variational method .",
    "first , it can be used to separate ghost contributions , as they appear in quenched or partially quenched calculations , from proper physical states . in the spectral decomposition ( [ corrmatrix ] ) ghosts appear with a modified time dependence . in @xcite it was shown that the ghost contribution couples to an individual eigenvalue ( up to the correction term ) .",
    "thus , these eigenvalues can be excluded from the analysis of the desired states .",
    "no modeling is necessary and thus no further uncertainties are introduced .",
    "second , the eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue problem ( [ generalized ] ) can be used to optimize the interval for fitting the eigenvalues .",
    "if one plots the entries of the eigenvector @xmath18 as a function of t , one finds that they form a plateau essentially in the same interval as the effective mass . only in the time interval",
    "where both , eigenvector components and effective mass , form a steady plateau , a fit to the eigenvalues is unambiguous .",
    "furthermore , the eigenvectors contain information about the strength with which the different basis interpolators couple to a hadronic state . thus , one can view them as a `` fingerprint '' of the corresponding state .",
    "the variational method heavily relies on a basis of operator which has a large overlap with the states one is interested in . to construct such a basis we use several differently smeared quark sources . in a previous , quenched study @xcite we have optimized the smearings to match gaussians which are ground and excited states of a spherical harmonic oscillator",
    "however , a first study on dynamical clover - wilson lattices has shown that it is very difficult to perform a similar matching .",
    "the reason is that with changing sea - quark mass the lattice spacing also changes which means that the smearing parameters have to be tuned for each set of configurations . in order to avoid such fine tuning procedures we simplify our construction of quark sources by using only a single gaussian source which we generate via jacobi smearing @xcite",
    "the idea of jacobi smearing is to create an extended source by iteratively applying the hopping part of the wilson term ( without dirac structure ) within the time slice of source and sink : @xmath19 \\ , .",
    "\\label{jacobismear}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we refer to the so constructed source as _ narrow source _ in the following and denote it with @xmath20 . in order to still allow for a radial excitation",
    "we also include a source where we apply a three - dimensional gauge covariant lattice laplacian @xmath21 onto the narrow smeared sources .",
    "this one we call _ laplacian source _ and denote it with @xmath22 .",
    "since both jacobi smearing and the laplacian are scalar operators , these do not change the quantum numbers of our generic meson interpolators .",
    "further operators can be added to the operator basis by also exploring the possibility of orbital excitations .",
    "to do so we include in our quark sources additional _ derivative sources_. they are constructed by applying a symmetric covariant lattice derivative @xmath23 in the appropriate direction onto the narrow smeared source .",
    "however , the resulting derivative sources , denoted by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , have to be combined appropriately with dirac gamma matrices , to construct meson interpolators with the desired quantum numbers . the necessary group theory for this",
    "can be found in @xcite and is later also used to construct operators for high spin mesons .",
    "finally , we also incorporate pointlike sources , denoted by @xmath27 , to our set of smearings .",
    "although the resulting interpolators have smaller overlap with the states , these additional sources give us the opportunity to not only extract the masses of the mesons , but also to compute local matrix elements which can be related to the decay constants of the mesons .",
    "to summarize , we use the six different quark sources listed in table [ quarksmearings ] : a point source @xmath27 , a narrow smeared source @xmath20 , a source @xmath22 , where a covariant spatial laplacian is applied to the narrow source , and derivative sources @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the latter ones are created by applying a covariant derivative in the corresponding spatial direction onto the narrow source . for the narrow source we use jacobi smearing with fixed parameters @xmath28 .",
