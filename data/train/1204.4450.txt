    "red supergiants ( rsgs ) are the evolved he - burning descendants of moderately massive ( 10 - 25m@xmath2 ) ob stars .",
    "although rsgs are not the most massive or most luminous members of the massive star population , they are the coolest and largest ( in physical size ) , and as such represent an important extreme in the h - r diagram ( hrd ) that has , in the past , been poorly matched by evolutionary tracks .",
    "the large radii and cool temperatures of rsgs are constrained by the hayashi limit , the coolest temperature at which a fully convective star would remain hydrostatically stable ( hayashi & hshi 1961 ) .",
    "the location of the hayashi limit is dependent on metallicity , shifting to warmer temperatures ( and therefore earlier spectral types ) at lower metallicities ( elias et al .",
    "1985 , levesque et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , for many years the placement of the hayashi limit on the hrd was at odds with the  observed \" locations of rsgs on the hrd , with the stars appearing to be considerably cooler and more luminous than theoretically permitted ( massey 2003 , massey & olsen 2003 ) .    in recent years , we have used the new generation of marcs stellar atmospheres to fit moderate - resolution spectrophotometry of rsgs in the milky way ( levesque et al . 2005 ) , the magellanic clouds ( levesque et al .",
    "2006 ) , and m31 ( massey et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this work has resulted in a significant revision of these stars effective temperature scales and their position on the h - r diagram . for the milky way and the large magellanic cloud ,",
    "the location of the rsgs is now in excellent agreement with the predictions of the evolutionary tracks .",
    "we also see that the distribution of spectral types in these galaxies shifts with metallicity , yielding earlier average rsg spectral types in lower - metallicity galaxies .",
    "while this shift is partially due to lower ti abundances yielding weaker tio band strengths , it can primarily be attributed to rsg populations in lower - metallicity galaxies having warmer median effective temperatures .",
    "this is a consequence of the metallicity - dependent hayashi limit , in accordance with the predictions of evolutionary models ( e.g. schaerer et al .",
    "1993 , charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 , maeder & meynet 2001 , meynet & maeder 2005 ) . the same effect is also observed in the red giant branches of globular clusters : a decrease in the number of heavy elements contributing electrons corresponds to a decrease in opacity and a corresponding increase in the stars surface temperature ( elias et al .",
    "1985 , levesque et al .  2006 ) .",
    "however , the lowest metallicity rsgs in our sample , from the smc , remain slightly cooler than the evolutionary models predict , with some rsgs in the sample remaining to the right of the hayashi track .",
    "it is unclear what exactly is causing this discrepancy .",
    "what is clear is that massive stellar evolution at low metallicity , particularly in the later stages of these stars lives , is still poorly understood .",
    "additionally , three rsgs in the smc and one in the lmc were found to display unusual variable behavior that has not been previously associated with rsgs , all showing considerable variations in @xmath3 magnitudes and effective temperatures ( and spectral types ) ( levesque et al .",
    "2007 , massey et al .",
    "these stars suffer dramatic physical changes on timescales of months - when they are at their warmest they are also brighter , more luminous , and show an increased amount of extinction .",
    "the extinction is characteristic of the effects of circumstellar dust ( massey et al . 2005 ) and is thought to indicate sporadic dust production from these stars in their coolest states .",
    "one parameter these variable stars share is unusually late spectral types ; two of these stars , hv 11423 and [ m2002 ] smc 055188 , were previously observed in an m4.5 i state , considerably later and cooler than any other star in the smc and lying well to the right of the hayashi limit .",

    "the initial sample selection was done using the massey ( 1998 ) two - color method , applying a cutoff line of @xmath19 in @xmath16 vs. @xmath15 diagrams for both galaxies ( figure 1 ) . for wlm",

    "when applied to our final sample size in each galaxy , we therefore conclude that all of the stars selected here are bona fide rsg members of ngc 6822 or wlm .",
    "the rsgs were observed using imacs ( dressler et al .",
    "2011 ) on the magellan baade 6.5-meter telescope at las campanas observatory on 07 - 08 august 2008 .",
    "conditions were clear on the first night , with sporadic high cirrus present on the second night ; seeing on both nights was 0.5 - 0.6 `` .",
    "the observations were obtained using five multi - object slitlet masks , three for wlm and two for ngc 6822 , with slit widths of 1.2 '' .",
    "these masks permitted us to observe all 16 wlm rsgs and 67 of the ngc 6822 rsgs .",
    "while all 16 wlm rsgs could have been included in two masks , three were advantageous as multiple orientations allowed us to account for the potential effects of crowding .",
    "the imacs f/4 camera gave us a field of view of 15 @xmath4 15 , which is well - matched to the size of the galaxies . using the 300 line mm@xmath5 grating , we were able to obtain spectra with a resolution of 10  with an exposure time of 3 hours on each mask .",
    "the three wlm masks were observed at average airmasses of 1.05 , 1.25 , and 1.38 , while the two ngc 6822 masks were observed at average airmasses of 1.37 and 1.39 .",
    "due to the fixed orientation required for multislit masks , our observations were not taken at the parallactic angle ; however , imacs has an atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) that compensates for atmospheric differential refraction .",
    "we required continuous spectral coverage between @xmath95000  and 8000  for our analyses .",
    "this initially posed a problem due to the configuration of the imacs mosaic1 detector at f/4 : the detector is an 8192 @xmath4 8192 ccd camera which consists of eight thinned 2k @xmath4 4k @xmath4 15@xmath20 ccd chips , arranged in a 2@xmath44 grid with gaps of @xmath962 pixels ( 12.4 \" ) between the individual chips .",
    "with one spectrum extending across four of these chips , at any single grating tilt sections of the spectrum would fall into these gaps between the ccd chips ( see figure 2 for an example of our raw multislit spectroscopic data from mosaic1 ) .",
    "this was avoided by observing each mask at two different grating tilts , 5.6 degrees ( central wavelength of 6015 ) and 5.8 degrees ( central wavelength of 6225 ) , in order to ensure complete spectral coverage for each spectrum .",
    "we reduced the data using iraf , rather than the carnegie observatories system for multiobject spectroscopy ( cosmos ) data reduction package for imacs .",
    "this permitted us to take a careful step - by - step approach to the delicate task of flux - calibrating multislit spectroscopic observations across the individual ccd chips of the mosaic1 detector .",
    "we observed several spectrophotometric standards for each mask ( ltt1020 , ltt7379 , ltt9239 , and cd-34 324 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) , placing each standard in central slits of our masks on both the upper and lower rows of ccd chips and observing each at both grating tilts . to ensure the best possible flux calibration",
    ", we then reduced the data for each individual chip separately , generating a specific sensitivity function ( using iraf s ` sensfunc ` task in the ` onedspec ` package ) derived from the portion of the spectrophotometric standard spectrum that fell on the chip .",
    "the rsg spectra on each chip were then calibrated using this sensitivity function and the ` calibrate ` function in iraf , and finally the individual calibrated components of each rsg spectrum were median - combined using iraf s ` scombine ` task to generate one complete stellar spectrum .",
    "we note that there are minor  plateaus \" in the stellar spectra at @xmath96000-6300  and @xmath97600-7800 , which correspond to the gaps in the ccd mosaic and do not impact our determination of the rsg spectral types .",
    "the main difficulty with flux calibrating the data in this manner arose when considering the horizontal ( dispersion axis ) geometry of the multislit masks . with multiple slits placed at a variety of positions relative to the grating , the wavelength coverage of each individual spectrum varied slightly as a result . in the case of wlm , where the geometry of the galaxy is narrow in the east - west dimension , this did not pose a significant problem - the wavelength coverage of the rsgs and the spectrophotometric standards were comparable as a whole and allowed us to flux - calibrate the key 5000-8000  region in all of the spectra .",
    "however , for the more extended east - west geometry of ngc 6822 this effect was considerable , and the spectral coverage of the spectrophotometric standards relative to the rsgs was insufficient . in figure 2",
    "we present the raw data from mosaic1 for one of our ngc 6822 multislit masks ; the bright sky lines illustrate the wide range in wavelength coverage spanned by the 34 spectra observed with this mask . as a result",
    ", we were able to flux calibrate the wlm rsgs , but not the ngc 6822 sample , which we leave in normalized relative flux units for the remainder of our analyses .",
    "for the wlm rsgs , 6 of the stars had poor s / n or poor wavelength coverage ; however , we were able to successfully flux calibrate the remaining 11 spectra . based on our reduction and analyses",
    ", we recommend that any future studies seeking to flux - calibrate multislit data should take particular care to observe spectrophotometric standards at multiple positions along the dispersion axis of a slitmask .    once the flux calibration for our wlm rsgs was complete , we calculated approximate ( monochromatic ) @xmath3 band magnitudes based on the stars 5556  fluxes , and compared these to the @xmath3 magnitudes determined from the lggs data ( massey et al .",
    "we found that all of our calibrations for each mask were consistently bright by uniform amounts , with standard deviations of 0.1 mag .",
    "this suggested that the disparity we were seeing was simply a grey shift in the spectrum . to confirm this we had to match the fluxes we determined for our flux - calibrated spectrophotometric standards , across a full range of bandwidths ranging from 5000  to 8000 .",
    "comparing our measured fluxes to the standard star files in iraf s ` onedstds ` directory , we found that our flux - calibrated spectra agreed excellently with the measured values , differing by small uniform amounts with standard deviations of several hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "based on this , we can confidently claim that the disagreement between the @xmath3 fluxes in our spectra and the @xmath3 fluxes in the lggs data are the result of an incorrect greyshift , rather than a problem with the flux calibration as a whole .",
    "we correct for this by manually greyshifting the observations to agree with the fluxes from lggs . as a result",
    ", our observations can not be used to determine photometric data for these stars , and the spectral coverage and flux precision is insufficient for stellar atmosphere model fitting . however",
    ", the overall shape of the stellar continuum has been properly determined and preserved , and can be used in comparisons with other rsg spectra to determine tio band depths and spectral types .",
    "our reduced ngc 6822 and wlm rsg stellar spectra were compared to observations of spectral standards from morgan & keenan ( 1973 ) by levesque et al .",
    "since this work originally found that several of the spectral  standards \" had to be reclassified , we also supplement our comparison spectra with additional rsgs from levesque et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , to ensure consistency in our spectral types .    for stars with late k or m spectral types ,",
    "spectral types are based on the strengths of the tio bands ( which themselves are sensitive to physical properties such as temperature and metallicity ) , with stronger bands corresponding to later spectral types .",
    "specifically , the types are primarily determined from the 6158 , 6658 , and 7054  bands following jaschek & jaschek ( 1990 ) , with tio bands further in the blue ( 5167 , 5448 , 5847 ) serving as secondary confirmations of the quality of the fit .    for early - k type stars ,",
    "this classification is considerably more challenging .",
    "typically , we base these spectral types on the strength of the g band and the ca i @xmath124226 line , since at this wavelength coverage and spectral resolution ( @xmath910 ) the spectrum of a k - type star is nearly featureless .",
    "however , these features are not included in our more limited spectral coverage for these rsgs , and we must therefore base our early - k spectral types entirely on the overall goodness of the spectral continuum fit .    for the ngc 6822 rsgs , we normalized our comparison star spectra for use with the non - flux - calibrated data .",
    "this allowed us to determine a best fit for stars with good s / n and evidence of tio bands in their spectra ; however , this also imposes a limitation on determining conclusive spectral types for ngc 6822 rsgs with early- and mid - k spectral types , as we can not base our fits on the overall sed shape .",
    "we must also exclude a number of rsgs with poor or noisy spectra where emerging tio features can not be confidently distinguished . as a result , we have limited our ngc 6822 spectral types to stars where we can confidently assign a spectral type of k5 i or later , the earliest type where tio features begin to emerge .",
    "this results in a total sample of 16 ngc 6822 rsgs , with a strong bias towards the late - type rsgs . in the case of the wlm rsgs",
    ", we were able to fit all 11 of our flux - calibrated spectra with the spectral standards , and could extend our spectral type determinations to the early - k subtypes ; however , it should be stressed that these k - type classifications have a lower confidence that the tio - based late - k and m spectral types .",
    "while we can confidently distinguish between  early \" k type stars with no visible tio features ( k0 - 1 i or k2 - 3 i ) and late - k types where tio features begin to emerge ( k5 i ) , the distinction between these early - type classifications is subject to the overall effects of reddening and surface gravity on the spectrum , as well as the goodness of the flux calibration .",
    "the spectral types and colors for these stars are given in table 1 ; color indices were determined using _ bvr _ photometry from lggs and @xmath21 photometry from 2mass , while previous rsg identifications and spectral types are taken from massey ( 1998 ) or targets from humphreys ( 1980 ) cross - referenced by massey et al .",

    "we can only give conservative lower limits of @xmath28 for wlm and @xmath29 for ngc 6822 based on foreground extinction ( massey et al .",

    "2008 ) find @xmath27 values ranging from 0.09 to 0.90 in their b and a supergiant sample . with the uncertain reddening for each rsg in our sample , we are therefore not currently equipped to estimate @xmath24 for the sample .",
    "similarly , determining bolometric luminosities is also not possible with the current data since , in addition to accounting for unknown reddening effects , rsgs have significant @xmath24-dependent bolometric corrections ( a 10% error in @xmath24 corresponds to a factor of 2 error in bolometric luminosity ; kurucz 1992 , massey & olsen 2003 ) .",
    "in addition to these rsgs , in table 2 we list the additional ngc 6822 rsgs from our sample whose spectral types could not be determined due to weak tio features or noisy spectra .",

    "it should be noted that the selection criteria for rsgs across different host galaxies results in a variation of the parameter space that is sampled ; while the milky way rsgs were selected based on membership in ob associations , the extragalactic rsg samples were selected based on their @xmath3 magnitudes and colors .",
    "in addition , more observations of rsgs in wlm and ngc 6822 are required to improve the completeness of the plot ( particularly for early - k supergiants in ngc 6822 ) . despite these deficiencies",
    ", we can clearly see that these samples follow the trend originally described by elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and massey & olsen ( 2003 ) , with the average spectral subtype for rsgs shifting to earlier types at lower metallicities as a result of metallicity effects on tio band strengths and the effective temperature of the hayashi limit .    in spite of this overall trend , and the expected accompanying restrictions of the hayashi limit ,",
    "unusually late - m supergiants are still present in all of the low - metallicity samples .",
    "j000158.14 - 152332.2 and j194453.46 - 144552.6 are both marked as clear outliers when compared to the other rsgs in their host galaxies .",
    "also labeled are the variable late - type outliers in the magellanic clouds ( lmc 170452 , smc 046662 , smc 055188 , and smc 050028 ; massey et al .",
    "2007 , levesque et al .  2007 ) and the unusual dust - enshrouded rsg woh g64 in the lmc . from this histogram , it is clear that both j000158.14 - 152332.2 and j194453.46 - 144552.6 are excellent candidates for follow - up studies searching for variable or dust - enshrouded rsgs in these low - metallicity host galaxies .    in addition , there is one rsg in our ngc 6822 sample , j194449.96 - 144333.5 , whose spectral type was found to be at odds with previous determinations .",
    "massey ( 1998 ) assigned this star a spectral type of m2.5 , while we assign it a spectral type of k5 . in figure 6",
    "we show the spectrum used in the massey ( 1998 ) classification , taken on 8 september 1997 at the kitt peak national observatory 4-meter telescope , and compare it to the spectrum from this work . from these observations , it is clear that the star s spectral type appears to be variable , with the 1997 spectrum showing much stronger tio bands .",
    "the 1997 spectrum also shows an unusual strong h@xmath30 absorption line ( equivalent width @xmath96 ) that is weaker in the 2008 spectrum ( equivalent width @xmath91 ) . for comparison ,",
    "figure 7 shows three different spectra of the previously - identified variable hv 11423 , an rsg in the smc .",
    "these spectra show very similar variations to our observations of j194449.96 - 144333.5 ; the star appears as a k0 i in 2004 , an m4 i in 2005 , and an m2.5 i in new observations of the star taken with imacs on magellan in august of 2010 .",
    "we therefore suggest that , in addition to j000158.14 - 152332.2 and j194453.46 - 144552.6 , j194449.96 - 144333.5 is a prime candidate for follow - up studies examining variable behavior .",
    "in addition , this star illustrates that type - variable rsgs can not necessarily be identified by aberrantly late spectral types in a single epoch of observations , since it is possible that they were simply captured in a early - type state .",
    "we observed extragalactic rsg populations in two low - metallicity local group galaxies using imacs . by combining these multislit observations with careful reductions and flux calibrations",
    ", we have acquired spectroscopic data for 16 rsgs in ngc 6822 and spectrophotometric data for 11 rsgs in wlm .",
    "we have determined spectral types for each of our rsg spectra , and use these data to extend the metallicity - dependent evolution of average rsg spectral types with abundance to new and lower metallicities . in addition , we have uncovered two rsgs , j194453.46 - 144552.6 and j000158.14 - 152332.2 , with anomalously late spectral types relative to their host populations , and a third rsg , j194449.96 - 144333.5 , that shows evidence of variable behavior from past spectra .    understanding the impact of metallicity on the observed properties of rsgs is vital to studies of extragalactic massive stars .",
    "the physical properties of rsgs , along with the phenomena driving their mass loss processes , are critical in local studies of supernova progenitors ( e.g. smartt et al .",
    "2009 , georgy 2012 ) and in high - redshift studies of young stellar populations where rsgs are the dominant dust producers ( massey et al .",
    "in addition , the trend toward earlier spectral types poses a potential problem for fully sampling the evolved supergiant populations in lower - metallicity hosts such as ngc 6822 , wlm , and the smc .",
    "any such survey must make an effort to include _ yellow _ supergiants , due to the metallicity - dependent evolutionary effects on the hayashi limit and the resulting skew towards an evolved supergiant population with slightly bluer colors at lower metallicities as a whole .",
    "however , removing foreground contaminants in yellow supergiant samples is challenging and requires detailed kinematic treatments ( e.g. drout et al .",
    "2009 , neugent et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "finally , the potential addition of two new stars to the sample of variable rsgs is extremely valuable .",
    "this is a small and poorly - understood sample of evolved massive stars , one that would benefit from additional observations or regular monitoring programs .",
    "new candidates could be detected through photometric observations , due to variations in these stars color indices , but unambiguous detections and confirmation of variability in stars such as j194449.96 - 144333.5 , j194453.46 - 144552.6 , and j000158.14 - 152332.2 will require multiple spectroscopic observations .",
    "confirming variable behavior in new candidates , and beginning to understand the physical phenomena driving these stars behavior , will require additional observations spanning a baseline of several years .",

    "<S> we present moderate - resolution spectroscopic observations of red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the low - metallicity local group galaxies ngc 6822 ( @xmath0 ) and wolf - lundmark - melotte ( wlm ; @xmath1 ) . by combining these observations with reduction techniques for multislit data reduction and flux calibration , we are able to analyze spectroscopic data of 16 rsgs in ngc 6822 and spectrophotometric data of 11 rsgs in wlm . using these observations </S>",
    "<S> we determine spectral types for these massive stars , comparing them to milky way and magellanic clouds rsgs and thus extending observational evidence of the abundance - dependent shift of rsg spectral types to lower metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have uncovered two rsgs with unusually late spectral types ( j000158.14 - 152332.2 in wlm , with a spectral type of m3 i , and j194453.46 - 144552.6 in ngc 6822 , with a spectral type of m4.5 i ) and a third rsg ( j194449.96 - 144333.5 in ngc 6822 ) whose spectral type has varied from a m2.5 in 1997 to a k5 in 2008 . </S>",
    "<S> all three of these stars could potentially be members of a recently - discovered class of extreme rsg variables . </S>"
