    "metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) in disordered systems have attracted much interest , theoretical as well as experimental , for forty years .",
    "milestones on this way were the concepts of anderson localization @xcite , of minimum metallic conductivity @xcite , the scaling theory of localization @xcite , and the renormalization group approach incorporating the electron - electron interaction into localization theory @xcite ; for surveys see refs .   .",
    "nevertheless , important questions have not been finally settled yet : contrary to mott s prediction of a finite minimum metallic conductivity , the scaling theory of localization predicts continuity of the conductivity at the mit for three - dimensional systems .",
    "that means , for the transition being approached from the metallic side at zero temperature , @xmath7 , the conductivity , @xmath8 , is expected to vanish continuously according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the control parameter ( concentration / magnetic field / stress ... ) , and @xmath11 for its value at the mit .",
    "the value of the critical exponent @xmath12 has been a subject of controversial debate since its first measurements , see e.g.  refs .. however , several studies have pointed to inconsistencies of the zero - temperature extrapolations inherent in the critical - exponent determination @xcite .",
    "these problems could , of course , arise from quantitative failure of the extrapolation formulae used or from imperfections of samples or @xmath13 and @xmath4 measurements , but they could also be caused by discontinuity of @xmath14 at @xmath11 @xcite , in which case the critical - exponent puzzle would simply be an artifact arising from unphysical fitting . the unclear situation described is the main motivation of the present study .    the recent discovery of a sharp mit in two - dimensional disordered systems @xcite has drawn interest to this subject , too . the scaling theory of localization of non - interacting electrons @xcite states that two - dimensional systems exhibit principally only activated conduction , and denies the existence of an mit in this situation .",
    "hence it does not describe nature in this case .",
    "this failure is a strong additional motivation to re - consider the applicability of that theory to the mit of three - dimensional systems .    in greater detail ,",
    "the critical step of most of the recent studies of the mit in three - dimensional disordered systems is the zero - temperature extrapolation , that is the determination of the limit @xmath15 , for samples close to the mit .",
    "this extrapolation can be based either on a microscopic theory , or on an empirically found relation supposed to be valid down to @xmath7 .",
    "the extrapolation is particularly difficult if a strong , but non - exponential @xmath4 dependence of @xmath13 is observed .",
    "in such a case , two interpretations are possible : +",
    "( i ) the sample could be metallic .",
    "this situation is mostly analyzed in terms of theories by altshuler and aronov @xcite , or newson and pepper @xcite , which yield @xmath16 with @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the former theory models the superposition of electron - electron interaction and disorder , but it is a perturbation theory so that its applicability very close to the transition is at least questionable .",
    "the latter theory considers the @xmath4-dependent drop of the diffusion constant as the decisive variation , and yields a power law with exponent 1/3 for @xmath19 .",
    "+ ( ii ) the sample could exhibit activated conduction with the characteristic energy being smaller than the lowest experimentally accessible @xmath4 .",
    "thus it would have to be classified as insulating ( at @xmath7 ) . if , as generally taken for granted , the characteristic energy vanishes continuously as @xmath20 , such an @xmath10 region exists always , see fig .  1 .",
    "but , to the best of our knowledge , there is no appropriate microscopic theory for a related quantitative analysis available .",
    "unfortunately , when considering non - exponential @xmath21 dependences , many of the recent experimental studies analyze the data only in terms of ( i ) .",
    "moreover , to agree with eq .",
    "( 1 ) , they presume that , as @xmath20 , the parameter @xmath22 tends to 0 .",
    "so it is not surprising that , when checking the applicability of eq .",
    "( 2 ) by considering the logarithmic derivative @xmath23 , doubts arose in several cases @xcite : this quantity must vanish as @xmath24 for metallic samples , but , instead , often increases or stays approximately constant for the sample(s ) assumed to be particularly close to the mit .",
    "therefore one should determine the mit point by simultaneously considering both sides of the transition .",
    "moreover , adjusting free parameters should be avoided to the largest possible extent .",
    "such an approach was successful for amorphous si@xmath0cr@xmath1 , see refs .. a simple phenomenological model of @xmath8 describing both sides of the mit was constructed for that system starting from the detection of universal features in @xmath8 , in particular from a scaling law for the @xmath4 dependence in the activated region , @xmath25 .",
    "however , annealing breaks this universality .    due to the controversial situation described above",
    ", the aim of the present work is to analyze the @xmath21 relations close to the transition in as unbiased a way as possible , without fitting . for that we study amorphous silicon nickel films , a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , prepared by electron beam evaporation .",
    "thus , though the above discussion concerns a general problem occuring for an arbitrary type of the control parameter @xmath10 , we focus now on a special case , and , in the following , @xmath10 stands only for metal concentration in an amorphous alloy . in our study , we put emphasis on two methodical points : firstly , we attach particular importance to the accuracy of the @xmath23 values .",
    "secondly , in order to avoid being mislead by having used special preparation conditions , we investigate two series of samples , prepared by groups in dresden and tel aviv",
    ".    there were several reasons for us to select a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 for a detailed investigation : +  we were looking for an alloy which is sufficiently stable but differs substantially from a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 which we had studied in detail previously @xcite . according to the melting temperatures @xcite , a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 can be expected to be rather stable , at least far more than a - si@xmath0au@xmath1 @xcite , or a - ge@xmath0au@xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a deep eutectic point close to the mit for the system si - cr , but not for si - ni @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a quenching experiment , it should be far more difficult to realize an amorphous structure close to the mit in si@xmath0ni@xmath1 than in si@xmath0cr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , it is an open question , to what extent such considerations can be applied also to films produced by evaporation , or by sputtering .",
    "+  a second important difference between a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 and a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 concerns the character of the silicide which should be formed first in annealing the samples , cf .  refs .",
    ": si@xmath26ni is a metal , whereas si@xmath26cr is a semiconductor with an indirect gap of roughly 0.3  ev @xcite .",
    "+  conductivity studies ( partly taking magnetoresistance into account ) on hydrogenated and unhydrogenated sputtered a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 films @xcite , as well as on polycrystalline films @xcite , and on the influence of annealing @xcite were available for comparison in the literature .",
    "moreover , in the vicinity of the mit , the electronic structure of a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 was recently studied by xps and ups @xcite . for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1:h , a structure study @xcite , optical conductivity measurements @xcite , also under pressure @xcite , and electronic structure investigations by xps and xes @xcite were reported in the literature .",
    "last but not least , some of the authors have gained detailed experience in trying fits of @xmath27 by conventional theories for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 samples prepared by electron - beam evaporation in tel aviv @xcite .    the present paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the sample preparation .",
    "section iii is devoted to the structural and chemical characterization , including an stm investigation .",
    "section iv gives some experimental details of the conductivity measurements , whereas section v analyses them in detail , and lists common and differing features of the two conductivity data sets . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the qualitative character of the mit . finally , in section vii , the conclusions from our findings are summarized .",
    "we compare a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 films , prepared by two different technologies .",
    "both technologies are based on electron - beam evaporation , but they have specific advantages and disadvantages : + ( a ) direct evaporation of sini alloys of various compositions from one crucible was used in dresden , cf .  ref .  .",
    "in this case , changes of power cause changes of the composition of the films by modifying the vapor pressure ratio of the alloy components via the changed temperature of the ingot . hence , the deposition rate has carefully to be held constant .",
    "moreover , it is essential that the whole ingot is liquid ; a check for contamination from the copper crucible showed it to be negligible .",
    "the @xmath10 drift over the film thickness arising from ni enrichment in the ingot material during evaporation is very small , see section iii , since only a small portion of the ingot was evaporated in each cycle .",
    "moreover , this drift is far smaller than the @xmath10 difference between samples prepared in successive cycles using the same ingot , because the time which we waited until rate and pressure were stable is considerably larger than the deposition duration .",
    "typical conditions were as follows : residual gas pressure during deposition @xmath28 , and rate @xmath29 .",
    "+ ( b ) co - evaporation of ni and si from separate crucibles was used in tel aviv to prepare in one deposition a whole set of samples .",
    "this method uses the varying incidence angles and distances to the sources to produce a composition gradient along a substrate .",
    "the film is then cut into narrow samples with their axes ( the direction of current flow ) perpendicular to the composition gradient @xcite .",
    "this technique has two advantages : composition determination is related to a geometrical measurement , and neighboring samples are prepared under almost identical conditions .",
    "thus the random errors in studying @xmath10 dependences can considerably be reduced . however , the crucial point is that one has to take great care to hold the ratio of the evaporation rates of both crucibles constant .",
    "the conditions were as follows : residual gas pressure during deposition @xmath30 , and , for the samples close to the mit , rate @xmath31 ; for more details see ref .   .",
    "in the following , we refer to the samples prepared by technology a by the numbers 1  6 , and to the samples produced by method b by the letters a  j. these two sample sets are labeled as a and b according to the preparation .",
    "tables i and ii give @xmath10 , film thickness , and conductivity at 300 and 4.2  k for the sets a and b , respectively . samples 6 and i , both deep in the metallic region , and sample j , close to the mit , are only included for comparison of @xmath10 scales .",
    "the chemical composition of the samples of set a was determined by rutherford backscattering ( rbs ) at the research center rossendorf within this work . for that we used sigradur substrates ( glassy carbon ) .",
    "we confirmed the consistency of these data by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy ( gdoes ) .",
    "energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx ) by means of a link an10000 eds system attached to a jsm-840 sem was used in determining the composition for sample set b in witwatersrand , south africa , within refs .   .",
    "the results of these analyses are given in tables i and ii .    in order to compare both @xmath10 scales",
    ", we performed additional edx analyses for samples 3 , 6 , f , h , and i by means of a tracor / noran spectrometer voyager iia , attached to a transmission electron microscope ( tem ) philips cm20feg , in dresden .",
    "for that , pieces of the film were scraped from the substrate with a steel knife , and placed on a carbon - film - coated copper microscope grid . moreover , for sample j , the witwatersrand edx result was checked by an rbs analysis performed in faure , south africa , within ref .  .",
    "the results of these analyses are presented in table iii .",
    "it illustrates the inconsistencies in the @xmath10 scales which were already pointed out in ref .  .",
    "note that the dresden edx data underestimate our rossendorf rbs values by roughly 5  at@xmath32 ni for sample 3 as well as for sample 6 .",
    "moreover , comparing the dresden edx data with the witwatersrand edx values @xcite , we conlcude that the latter overestimate the ni content , according to our rbs , by roughly 6  at@xmath32 close to the mit .",
    "this is confirmed by the comparison of south african edx and rbs data for sample j , yielding a difference of 5.3  at@xmath32 .",
    "for sample i , the edx value of ref .   might be very close to the ni content according to our rbs scale ",
    "iii suggests that the systematic deviation of the dresden edx values from our rbs data could be roughly constant .",
    "finally , an additional check with an sini@xmath26 bulk standard showed the witwatersrand edx to overestimate the true value by roughly 3  at@xmath32 there .",
    "we consider the rbs as likely to give the most accurate @xmath10 values since this method is quantitative from first principles and does not require elemental standards @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the good agreement of both rbs scales in table iii . in our case ,",
    "the relative uncertainty of the corresponding ni : si ratios was estimated to be better than 2  @xmath32 , so that the related absolute error of the ni content should not exceed 0.3  at@xmath32 in the mit region .",
    "the quantitative result of the edx analysis however is influenced by a series of effects , in particular this method needs standards and various corrections @xcite .",
    "therefore , the systematic errors can amount to several at@xmath32 so that the differences between the columns of table iii are not surprising .",
    "the @xmath10 data , given in tables i to iii , and discussed in the previous paragraphs , are obtained from the ni : si ratio ignoring all kinds of contamination .",
    "different kinds of analysis showed oxygen contamination to be the most relevant one . by means of edx",
    ", we obtained 4.4 and 11  at@xmath32 as oxygen concentration in the samples 3 and h , respectively .",
    "if the oxygen were distributed homogeneously in the films , a ni concentration of 20  at@xmath32 determined from the ni : si ratio would correspond to true 19.2 and 18  at@xmath32 ni for series a and b , respectively .",
    "however , some of the oxygen is expected to be concentrated close to the film surface and the film - substrate interface , so that this quantitative information should not be overvalued .",
    "both sets of films were found to be well homogeneous .",
    "laterally we checked this by edx and electrical measurements for both sets .",
    "changes in vertical direction might be critical in both technologies .",
    "we used gdoes to clarify this point . because of the non - conducting substrate",
    ", we applied our self - developed radiofrequency equipment , a new and very suitable device for studying vertical concentration variations @xcite . for series",
    "b , the vertical homogeneity was also checked by monitoring the quotient of the ni and si evaporation rates during film deposition @xcite .    by means of gdoes , the ni :",
    "si ratio was found to deviate from the respective mean values through the thickness of the samples by not more than 5  @xmath32 for both sample sets , corresponding to @xmath33 ni close to the mit .",
    "2 shows depth profiles for series a and b. note the constancy of the ni signal .",
    "the variation of the si signal at the beginning is an artifact .",
    "it arises from the strong dependence of the intensity of the si line used on the changing plasma parameters at ignition .",
    "this variation is caused by surface contamination indicated by the c ( carbon ) signal ; this was checked by additional experiments .",
    "therefore , we estimated the relative variation of the ni : si ratio from the ni signal .",
    "the microstructure of the samples of both sets was investigated by tem . in all cases ,",
    "the samples were found to be well amorphous .",
    "however , the existence of crystalline regions with diameters below 2  nm can not be excluded .",
    "such a clustering is suggested by , cf ..    the topography of the a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 films was studied ex situ by means of a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) under uhv conditions ( @xmath34 ) . for that purpose",
    ", we used a modified omicron - uhv - stm with etched tungsten tip and partly self - made electronics . a typical topography of sample 3 is given in fig .",
    "3 . three corresponding cross - sections are presented in fig .",
    "4 . for sample",
    "f , we obtained very similar results .",
    "3 and 4 show that there are fluctuations in the film thickness of typically @xmath35  nm . in rare cases ,",
    "the fluctuations reach an altitude of @xmath36  nm .",
    "the horizontal diameter of these hills amounts to the order of 30  nm .",
    "however , there is also a fine structure on a smaller scale , which fact might be related to some fractal structuring @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we have no information to what extent these structures can be considered as representing a surface roughness only , or whether they originate from a columnar film growth , see e.g.ref .  .",
    "the surface roughness could cause differences between technologies a and b concerning the chemical homogeneity of the films when considering a mesoscopic length scale : the local chemical composition is independent of the surface slope in technology a. however , during gradient film deposition by means of technology b , the variation of the surface slope causes a fluctuation of the si and ni incidence angles , where an increase of the former is correlated with a decrease of the latter .",
    "thus the chemical composition of these films ought to fluctuate on a mesoscopic length scale @xcite .    to estimate quantatively",
    "this effect is difficult for two reasons : ( i ) the fluctuation strength depends on the size of the surface area taken into account in averaging .",
    "( ii ) we have no information on surface and volume diffusion lengths limiting composition fluctuations . as an example",
    ", we consider a cube with edge length 2.4  nm , and assume the diffusion lengths not to exceed this value .",
    "the typical surface slope , estimated as root mean square of the difference quotient @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 ) for several cross sections , corresponds to an angle of 14 degrees . for sample",
    "f , the incidence angles of the si and ni atoms , arriving from opposite sides , are roughly 10 and 45 degrees .",
    "this sample has a mean ni content of 24.8  at@xmath32 according to the edx scale of ref .   .",
    "thus the fluctuation of the incidence angle due to the surface roughness causes composition fluctuations with a mean deviation of @xmath39  at@xmath32 ni .",
    "this value is by a factor of 3 larger than the finite size induced random dispersion of the ni content .",
    "however , since the regions of maximum and minimum ni content do not form a percolative network , they have to be considered as local inclusions .",
    "three types of measurements have been performed to study the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath13 : + ( a ) 2  300 k using a self - built cryostat insert based on a bell technique , which permits very accurate stabilization of @xmath4 over the whole interval , so that a high accuracy of the values of the logarithmic derivative is guaranteed , + ( b ) 0.45  4.2 k using an rmc @xmath40he cryostat , and + ( c ) 35  900 mk using a dilution refrigerator kelvinox 300 from oxford instruments .",
    "+ measurements ( a ) of the b samples are repetitions with increased accuracy of the investigations in refs .. some of the measurements ( b ) were already published in refs .. however , within this study they were re - analyzed , and the values of the logarithmic derivative were re - calculated by means of eqs .",
    "( 8,9 ) below .",
    "two methods of making contacts to the samples were used : the leads were attached either by pressing indium tabs onto the sample , or by silver paste .",
    "both these technologies avoid post - preparation heating of the films , but they need care to avoid contact problems in thermal cycling .",
    "a specific problem consists in the aging of the samples which can cause a resistivity change up to the order of 10  @xmath32 .",
    "thus we performed annealing experiments : metallic films are influenced only slightly by annealing below roughly 150@xmath41c , but annealing up to about 300@xmath41c leads to great changes , cf .",
    "refs .   .",
    "repeated thermal cycling between cryogenic and room temperatures can cause resistivity changes by a few @xmath32 as well , but no drift is detectable in thermal cycling between 2 and 4.2  k. the usual aging concerns only the absolute value of the resistivity ; the resistivity ratio @xmath42 was observed to remain almost unchanged .",
    "therefore we do not consider the sample after aging / thermal cycling to be a different sample , as if prepared under different conditions , and we simply scale the resistivity when necessary to retain the original value at an appropriate @xmath4 .",
    "however , this scaling is irrelevant for the consideration of the logarithmic derivative , on which the main conclusion of this paper is based .",
    "overviews for both the data sets a and b are shown in fig .",
    "both data sets exhibit consistent behavior , with some systematic differences between them . for comparison ,",
    "5a includes data of two sputtered a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 films from ref .  , resembling the curves of our evaporated samples very much",
    ". however , it is almost impossible to obtain reliable information on physical mechanisms directly from these only weakly structured curves .",
    "the standard analysis for determining the critical concentration of the mit , based on extrapolation according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) with @xmath17 , is presented in fig .",
    "6 . indeed , if only data points between roughly 2 and 30  k are taken into consideration , linear relations corresponding to eq .",
    "( 2 ) are found in the @xmath13 versus @xmath43 representations . according to this analysis",
    "the mit should be located just below the @xmath10 of sample 1 in set a , and between samples c and d in set b. however , inclusion of the data around and below about 1  k shows that this classification is questionable .",
    "more insight can be gained by considering the logarithmic derivative , @xmath44 its limiting behavior for vanishing @xmath4 allows one to detect the transition point @xcite .    as a first approach to an understanding of how @xmath6 reflects the character of the mit ,",
    "let us assume that , for a given sample , the logarithmic derivative of the conductivity can be approximated by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an experimentally accessible temperature , at which @xmath13 has been measured .",

    "( 4 ) : @xmath52    interpreting eqs .  ( 6,7 ) , we have to discriminate between the eight situations listed in table iv . according to this table",
    ", @xmath53 indicates metallic character of the conduction , whereas both diverging and finite positive @xmath54 point out that the sample is an insulator , cf .   refs .  .",
    "in more detail , diverging and finite positive @xmath54 are correlated with vanishing of @xmath13 as @xmath24 according to exponential and power laws , respectively , cf .",
    "( 6,7 ) . studying an mit , we can exclude the case that the limit @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath56 , as unphysical .",
    "however , this does of course not exclude negative @xmath5 at finite @xmath4 , which can arise from weak antilocalization , or e.g.  from electron - phonon scattering in good metals .    in this context",
    ", we may ask what the condition is for observing exponential behavior , @xmath57 .",
    "the condition @xmath58 implies @xmath59 . thus there exists a low-@xmath5 range where , though increase of @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath4 would rule out metallic conduction , it would still not be possible to identify activated conduction by detecting exponential @xmath27 .",
    "however , assuming only monotonicity of @xmath5 as @xmath24 , one reaches an unambiguous decision .",
    "the logarithmic derivative is also helpful in identifying the physical mechanisms involved @xcite since it makes characteristic features of @xmath27 visible , which are not obvious from @xmath27 itself .",
    "an additional advantage of this quantity is that it is not influenced by geometrical errors , nor by the scaling of the resistivity mentioned above .",
    "our method of data evaluation for analyses in terms of @xmath5 is based on that used in ref .  : a linear fit of @xmath60 versus @xmath61 for @xmath62 neighboring points is performed , @xmath63 in order to minimize the numerical error arising from the non - linearity of the dependence of @xmath60 from @xmath61 , we relate this @xmath5 value to a mean temperature , @xmath64 , defined by @xmath65 thus @xmath66 would exactly equal @xmath67 if @xmath60 were a second order polynomial of @xmath61 . utilizing eqs .",
    "( 8,9 ) allows one to take into consideration rather broad @xmath4 intervals , so that the total error ( numerical plus random ) can be kept small .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath62 depends on the accuracy and density of the data points , as well as on the structure of the measured curve .",
    "we considered the following groups of neighboring data points : the measurements in the region 2  300 k yielded data points with comparably high accuracy , but low density . from them , the logarithmic derivative was obtained using @xmath68 below 7  k , and @xmath69 above . in the @xmath40he region , the density of data points is considerably higher , thus 8 neighboring data points were considered in differentiating for all samples except for h , for which we used 4 points .",
    "the data obtained in the dilution refrigerator were evaluated using @xmath70 .",
    "7 gives a survey of the @xmath4 dependences of the logarithmic derivative .",
    "low-@xmath4 details become visible in fig .",
    "these figures show that both the sample sets a and b are internally consistent . however , there are also significant differences between these sets .",
    "consider first the common features : for both data sets , at sufficiently high @xmath4 , all samples studied behave very similarly : @xmath3 increases with increasing @xmath4 . on the other hand , for the samples with the smallest ni content , at low @xmath4 , there is a pronounced increase of @xmath3 with decreasing @xmath4 , indicating activated conduction .",
    "the strength of this contribution decreases with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "one common feature of all samples ( with @xmath71 ) , which exhibit such an increase of @xmath5 with decreasing @xmath4 , has to be stressed : this increase continues down to the lowest accessible @xmath4 .",
    "the extrapolation / generalization of this finding will be a basic assumption of our data analysis .",
    "the differing behavior at low and high @xmath4 must be caused by two different mechanisms being dominant at low and high @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the low-@xmath4 mechanism related to increasing @xmath3 as @xmath4 decreases is very likely a kind of hopping conduction , cf .",
    "refs .. concerning the origin of the high-@xmath4 contribution we can only speculate .",
    "such a high-@xmath4 contribution is common to many amorphous transition - metal semiconductor alloys @xcite . comparing energy scales ,",
    "it was speculated that in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 this mechanism might be related to electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "the feature , which we consider to be particularly interesting in figs .",
    "7 and 8 , is the minimum of @xmath3 related to the crossover between these two mechanisms .",
    "this minimum is located at @xmath72 for sample a , which is the most insulating sample studied .",
    "the related minimum value of @xmath5 is @xmath73 .",
    "the minimum shifts to lower @xmath4 with increasing ni content .",
    "this behavior has to be expected since the characteristic hopping energy should tend to 0 as the transition is approached , so that hopping only becomes dominant at lower and lower @xmath4 .",
    "simultaneously with @xmath74 , @xmath75 decreases : for the a samples 1 and 2 , @xmath76 and 4  k , respectively , where @xmath77 and 0.32 . for the b samples d and e ,",
    "@xmath78 and 0.2  k , respectively , where @xmath79 and 0.06 .",
    "the four samples 1 , 2 , d , and e must be insulating because , for them , @xmath3 increases with decreasing @xmath4 at the low-@xmath4 end of the @xmath4 range considered .",
    "this increase can not be understood in terms of metallic behavior according to eq .",
    "moreover , because of the overall behavior of @xmath6 ( see first paragraph of this subsection ) , it is very likely that this trend continues as @xmath24 what indicates insulating character according to tab .",
    "iv . furthermore",
    ", even if @xmath3 does not increase as @xmath24 but only remains constant , i.e. , @xmath80 , the samples still have to be classified as insulating , because @xmath81 , cf .",
    "previous subsection .",
    "this finding rules out the classification of these four samples as metallic according to the standard procedure used in fig .",
    "6 .    however , for the samples 3 , 4 , and 5 , @xmath3 seems to tend to 0 as @xmath24 , as well as for the samples g and h. ( in this judgement , we presume that , since we study an mit , the limit @xmath82 , see previous subsection . ) for sample f , we can not decide whether or not @xmath53 although we investigated it down to 35  mk .",
    "thus we conclude that the mit should take place between samples 2 and 3 for set a , and between samples e and g for set b.    in the calculation of the critical ni contents , and of their possible errors , we take into account the ni concentrations of the samples bracketing the transition , the uncertainty of the @xmath10 values , and the influence of preparation conditions differing slightly from sample to sample in technology a. for sample sets a and b , we obtain @xmath83 according to our rbs scale , and @xmath84 according to the edx scale of ref .   , respectively . in order to compare both values ,",
    "we scale the edx data by means of table iii : presuming a linear relation between both edx scales close to @xmath11 , and the rbs value to exceed the edx value of this study by 5  at@xmath32 , one obtains @xmath85 as the critical ni content of sample set b according to our rbs scale . additionally performing the correction concerning the oxygen concentration , see section iii , we obtain similar values for the critical concentration : @xmath86 and @xmath87 ni for series a and b , respectively .",
    "note however , that this agreement is not a necessity . on the contrary , since o is very reactive , it would not be surprising if the o contamination significantly influenced the gap states and shifted @xmath11 , cf .",
    "the role of h in a - si based alloys @xcite .",
    "the consideration of the samples bracketing the transition in both sets shows that , at high @xmath4 , samples with @xmath10 just below and above @xmath11 exhibit very similar @xmath4 dependences of @xmath5  there is no experimental indication of a discontinuity in the @xmath10 dependence at finite @xmath4 .",
    "hence the respective substantial variations of @xmath13 with @xmath4 on both sides of the mit must originate from the same physical mechanism , which , crudely speaking , `` survives '' the transition .",
    "this high-@xmath4 mechanism yields a substantial contribution to @xmath5 down to the lowest @xmath4 studied , compare the samples closest to the mit .",
    "thus there is a superposition of the low- and high-@xmath4 contributions , whatever mechanisms they represent , in the whole @xmath4 interval investigated .",
    "this has an important consequence : in fitting simply to a pure hopping relation close to the mit , or to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one might obtain a precise mathematical description , but the derived parameters would not have physical relevance .    concerning the high-@xmath4 mechanism , the comparison with a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 given in fig .",
    "9 is interesting . for both the a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 sample @xmath88 and the a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 sample 4 , @xmath89 .",
    "however , with decreasing @xmath4 , the influence of the high-@xmath4 mechanism decreases considerably faster in sample @xmath88 than in sample 4 : @xmath90 and 0.16 for samples @xmath88 and 4 , respectively .",
    "this faster decrease of the influence of the high-@xmath4 mechanism is a general feature of a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 .",
    "it has two consequences : ( i ) comparing insulating samples of both substances with the same @xmath75 , the minimum is reached in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 at clearly higher @xmath4 than in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , compare sample @xmath91 with sample 2 in figs .  9 and 7a , respectively .",
    "( ii ) in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 , there are minima in @xmath27 , i.e. , zeros in @xmath3 , at significantly higher @xmath4 than in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , consider samples @xmath88 and @xmath92 , and see next subsection .",
    "thus , in contrast to a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , there is a broad , easily accessible low-@xmath4 region in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 , where one can ignore this high-@xmath4 contribution , and study the pure low-@xmath4 mechanisms .",
    "besides the common features described above , there are significant differences between the data sets a and b. these differences concern both the high-@xmath4 and the low-@xmath4 regions .    comparing a and b samples with similar low - temperature @xmath3 values ,",
    "the a samples are found to exhibit larger high - temperature @xmath5 values , i.e. , they are more strongly @xmath4 dependent . in detail",
    ", @xmath93 and @xmath94 for sets a and b , respectively .",
    "this might indicate a similarity to a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 , where the high-@xmath4 mechanism seems to lose its influence with increasing oxygen content of the films , compare fig .  2 of ref .   with fig",
    ".  1 of ref .   .",
    "the same seems to be valid for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 : the high-@xmath4 contribution has smaller influence for series b , for which the oxygen contamination is larger , as observed by edx .    for samples exhibiting a decrease of @xmath3 as @xmath24 ,",
    "this decrease is steeper for the a than for the b samples .",
    "sample 3 even exhibits a zero of @xmath3 at about 0.9  k , and for sample 4 a zero just below the lowest measuring @xmath4 is very likely .",
    "but such a zero was not found for the b samples within the @xmath4 region studied .",
    "thus , in comparing the metallic samples of both sets , i.e. , 3 , 4 , 5 and g , h , it is puzzling that for the a but not for the b samples there is visible a contribution to @xmath27 with negative @xmath4 derivative . under",
    "what conditions such a contribution exists is a question of current interest @xcite .",
    "e.g.  such contributions were observed in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 @xcite , as well as in heavily doped crystalline si : p @xcite and ge : sb @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether the missing of this contribution in the b samples is real , or whether this contribution is obscured in set b by the low-@xmath4 part of the high-@xmath4 contribution .",
    "the latter hypothesis is suggested by the comparison in fig .",
    "7a which demonstrates that this low-@xmath4 part is considerably larger in the b samples than in the a samples .",
    "because our experimental data on the contribution with negative @xmath95 are very sparse , we can only speculate on the physical mechanism behind .",
    "it is likely that its origin is the same as in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 @xcite , see also fig .   9 , heavily doped crystalline si : p @xcite , and ge : sb @xcite , that means probably some interplay of electron - electron interaction and disorder .",
    "however , the interpretation in terms of precursors of a metal - superconductor transition as in a - si@xmath0au@xmath1 , where both the pure constituents do not become superconducting @xcite , can not be ruled out yet .",
    "further investigations at lower @xmath4 are desirable .    since great care was taken for both sample sets concerning homogeneity , we ascribe the differences stressed to the influence of differing preparation conditions . significant contamination by crucible material could be excluded for both sample sets : in a related gdoes study , the contamination of an a sample by copper from the crucible was found to be below 500 ppm . concerning a crucible - material - contamination check for the b samples",
    "see ref .  .",
    "thus only three possibilities seem to remain : +  contamination by any constituents from the residual gas , +  differing surface diffusion during deposition arising from the differences in rate and / or temperature , and +  concentration fluctuations on a mesoscopic length scale arising in the technology b , cf .",
    "section iii .",
    "+ further investigations are needed to clarify this point .",
    "the common features of both sample sets suggest an important qualitative conclusion concerning the character of the mit , as will be explained in this section .",
    "figs .  7 and 8 , together with tables",
    "i and ii , show that @xmath96 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath10 , at least as long as @xmath71 .",
    "thus there must be a separatrix ( separating line ) , above which insulating and below which metallic samples are located in these graphs .",
    "more accurately , instead of a separatrix , there could also exist a separating strip , but this would imply a discontinuity in @xmath97 for which there is no experimental evidence in this experiment , nor in the literature .",
    "now we compare the consequences of the common assumptions with experiment .",
    "for that we assume that the transition is continuous , as described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and that , sufficiently close to the transition , below some temperature @xmath98 , eq .",
    "( 2 ) holds .",
    "these equations imply three conclusions on @xmath6 :    \\(i ) @xmath99 since @xmath100 . thus the separatrix should be parallel to the @xmath4 axis below @xmath98 .",
    "\\(ii ) for metallic samples close to the mit , @xmath101 as long as @xmath102 . in other words , since @xmath103 vanishes as @xmath20 , the logarithmic derivative @xmath104 should exhibit a plateau below @xmath98 , which extends to lower @xmath4 the closer @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "\\(iii ) a plateau should also be present on the insulating side close to @xmath11 below @xmath98 for the following reasons . since the charateristic hopping energy very likely tends continuously to 0 as @xmath20 , the crossover temperature , below which the influence of hopping dominates the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath5 , vanishes too .",
    "continuity of @xmath97 leads to the expectation that @xmath105 above that crossover temperature .",
    "however , according to our experimental data , such a plateau is missing . instead",
    ", for arbitrary fixed @xmath4 , @xmath106 must be smaller than @xmath3 of samples 2 and e , but exceed @xmath3 of samples 3 and g for sample sets a and b , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath106 decreases with decreasing @xmath4 , at least down to 0.2 k , where @xmath107 .",
    "there is no experimental hint for @xmath106 at even lower @xmath4 to rise again up to one of the theory values 1/2 or 1/3 , and to saturate there ; for @xmath10 close to @xmath11 , such a behavior would imply the existence of metallic @xmath3 curves with a low-@xmath4 maximum , so that it would contradict the assumption on monotonicity of @xmath3 as @xmath4 vanishes for samples with @xmath71 and @xmath108 , concluded in section v.c from our experimental data .",
    "hence , at least one of the standard descriptions eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) is very likely not valid : either the relevant mechanism at the transition is related to a value of @xmath109 which is far smaller than expected , or the transition is not continuous at @xmath7 , since @xmath110 indicates finite @xmath111 according to table iv .      to illustrate the problem from a different perspective",
    ", we study @xmath6 for two qualitative empirical models .",
    "they are constructed so that continuity at @xmath11 for arbitrary finite @xmath4 and monotonic behavior of @xmath97 are guaranteed .",
    "first we assume the transition to be continuous also at @xmath7 .",
    "one of the simplest suitable models is @xmath112 where @xmath113 , and @xmath114 . for simplicity ,",
    "all quantities are given in dimensionless form .",
    "corresponding @xmath3 curves are presented in fig .  10 .",
    "note that there are no pieces with @xmath115 which belong to insulating samples , and that , if @xmath116 , @xmath117 is always positive .",
    "next we assume the transition to be discontinuous , but only at @xmath7 .",
    "we consider again a very simple qualitative model : @xmath118 where @xmath113 , and @xmath119 . in order to illustrate how this model unifies a discontinuity of @xmath120 at @xmath7 with continuity for @xmath121 , we present @xmath122 and @xmath120 in figs .  11a and 11b , respectively .",
    "the latter graph is based on the following additional assumptions : @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , where using 2 as critical exponent of @xmath126 is motivated by ; however , the qualitative properties of the model considered do not depend on the numbers chosen . figs .",
    "11a and 11b demonstrate two remarkable features of the model ( 11 ) : ( i ) if some low-@xmath4 range , e.g.  the shaded area , is masked , a misinterpretation of the activated curves closest to the mit as metallic ones is tempting , and one could even conclude that the transition is continuous .",
    "( ii ) the singularity of @xmath14 at @xmath11 evolves with decreasing @xmath4 because @xmath120 becomes increasingly steep just below @xmath11 .",
    "12 shows the @xmath3 curves for model ( 11 ) .",
    "contrary to fig .",
    "10 , this figure includes minima of @xmath104 with very small values of @xmath127 at @xmath128 , where @xmath128 as well as @xmath127 vanish as @xmath20 .",

    "12 resembles far more the experimental figures than fig .",
    "thus , a discontinuity of @xmath14 is suggested , provided @xmath106 does not finally saturate ( at some value far lower than theoretically expected ) below the lowest experimentally accessible @xmath4 as @xmath4 decreases . however",
    ", this result was obtained using a very simple model .",
    "the question of its general validity is considered in the next subsection .      the argumentation leading from the discontinuous character of the mit , as modeled by eq .  ( 11 ) , to the qualitative character of @xmath6 shown in fig .",
    "12 can easily be reversed : figs .",
    "7 and 8 suggest the assumption that @xmath134 as @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , we only need the experimentally demonstrated monotonicity of @xmath120 , that is @xmath135 .",

    "+ ( ii ) for `` metallic '' samples , there are numbers @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( independent of @xmath10 ) such that @xmath142    we assume that we have determined @xmath143 experimentally .",
    "for the `` insulating '' @xmath10 region , integration of eq .",
    "( 12 ) leads to @xmath144 so that @xmath145 now we turn to the `` metallic '' region . for @xmath19 , integration of eq .",

    "( in our case , fig .",
    "8 leads to the estimates @xmath148 and @xmath149 for @xmath150 , so that @xmath151 . ) finally , due to the monotonicity of @xmath120 , we get @xmath152    hence , the classifications of the samples according to @xmath153 and @xmath15 , respectively , are identical , and we arrive at the following conclusion : provided our qualitative assumptions on the limiting behavior of @xmath106 and the monotonicity of @xmath97 are justified , there must be a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "we must , however , look back at our arguments to see what would be necessary for the transition nevertheless to be continuous , in which manner condition ( 13 ) would have to be weakened .",
    "two possibilities have already been mentioned : ( i ) the behavior of @xmath6 might qualitatively change at temperatures below the lowest one accessible to us . (",
    "ii ) at @xmath11 , the parameter @xmath154 of eq .",
    "( 4 ) might have a small but finite value , far smaller than the values 1/2 and 1/3 , which were predicted theoretically in refs .   and used in many experimental studies in the literature .",
    "a third possibility is found when referring to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , which , for @xmath155 , simplifies to @xmath156 . for no discontinuity to occur , it has to be possible to reach any ( arbitrarily small ) @xmath157 .",
    "the first term , @xmath158 , is finite due to the monotonicity of @xmath143 and the finite @xmath13 values observed in the insulating region at @xmath46 .",
    "thus for no discontinuity to occur , @xmath159 has to be infinite . since @xmath160",
    ", the exponent @xmath141 must be infinitely small .",
    "for @xmath4 independent @xmath141 , this situation is equivalent to the case ( ii ) above , that is the situation of a small but finite @xmath154 .",
    "the only remaining possibility is that of a @xmath4 dependent @xmath141 , vanishing as @xmath24 for @xmath19 .",
    "this would imply a non - power law behavior of @xmath161 .",
    "if one would nevertheless try to fit @xmath162 , the effective exponent @xmath109 would be @xmath4 dependent , and approach 0 as @xmath24",
    ".    however , we know of no physical argument that suggests that the power law ( which is derived by perturbation arguments ) should weaken at low @xmath4 , and we did not obtain any data that suggest that there is a tendency towards such a change at lowest accessible @xmath4 . therefore , for @xmath163 , although continuity across the transition is theoretically possible , experimental evidence appears to indicate that the transition is , in fact , discontinuous .",
    "finally , the question remains whether or not this result might be an artifact arising from any sample inhomogeneities .",
    "we utilized all available experimental possibilities to control and to minimize macroscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "nevertheless , surely some small composition gradients remain . calculating the @xmath7 conductance of samples with constant @xmath10 gradients perpendicular and parallel to the current direction , respectively , assuming eq .",
    "( 1 ) to be valid , one obtains the following results : in the former case , the transition is `` smeared out '' , but in the latter case , provided the exponent @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) satisfies @xmath164 , a sharp transition would result .",
    "however , according to the preparation technologies used , the inhomogeneities should be considerably smaller parallel to the current direction than perpendicular to it",
    ". thus the influence of a parallel @xmath10 gradient is probably overcompensated by the perpendicular inhomogeneities .",
    "moreover , the hypothesis that the discontinuous transition for @xmath7 might be only an artifact originating from a parallel gradient , is ruled out by the behavior of @xmath104 for the region where @xmath102 .",
    "the logarithmic derivative would have to exhibit a plateau @xmath165 here according to the gradient hypothesis , but we did not find one .      in summary , it is very likely that @xmath14 exhibits a discontinuity in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , corresponding to mott s idea of a minimum metallic conductivity @xmath166 @xcite , but @xmath167 should be continuous for arbitrary finite @xmath4 .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that @xmath106 changes its behavior , in particular that it saturates at some finite value , at temperatures lower than those experimentally accessible to us .",
    "this would correspond to the @xmath4 exponent in eq .",
    "( 2 ) becoming much smaller than expected theoretically .",
    "thus a conclusion with complete certainty is impossible .",
    "our experimental data only allow us to determine bounds for @xmath166 . from the sample",
    "sets a and b we get @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to compare these data with mott s theoretical result for @xmath166 @xcite , though electron - electron interaction and weak localization effects are neglected in its derivation .",
    "according to ref .  , @xmath170 , where @xmath22 denotes the distance between neighboring impurity atoms , i.e. , ni atoms , at the mit .",
    "taking the atomic density of the samples to be similar that in crystalline si , we get @xmath171 .",
    "this estimate fits with the mott - edwards - sienko criterion , @xmath172 with @xmath173 being the bohr orbit radius of an isolated center and @xmath174 the critical impurity density @xcite : approximating @xmath173 by half the nearest neighbor distance of crystalline ni , @xmath175 , yields just the expected product value .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath176 .",
    "this result exceeds our lower and upper bounds on @xmath166 by factors of roughly 5 and 2 , respectively .",
    "note however that the above consideration does not take account of the possible d character of the ni states ; moreover , the dimensionless parameters have some uncertainty .    for comparison , for a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 ,",
    "the conductivity studies lead to @xmath177 @xcite . in that substance",
    ", annealing causes a conductivity decrease @xcite , but the question whether or not annealing also causes a decrease of @xmath166 is still open .",
    "however , due to the differences between the phase diagrams of the systems si - ni and si - cr , see section i , the following hypothesis is suggested : if , instead of the ni - ni distance , the distance between metallic nisi@xmath26 grains were the relevant length for @xmath166 , the relatively small value of @xmath166 in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 might result from the formation of nisi@xmath26 crystalline regions with a diameter of the order of 1 to 2  nm , cf .   .",
    "corresponding structural studies would be interesting .",
    "the main result of our study is the following : the @xmath4 dependence of the logarithmic temperature derivative of the conductivity , @xmath178 , for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 qualitatively differs from the predictions of commonly accepted theory . according to this theory ,",
    "@xmath14 is continuous , and , on the metallic side of the mit , @xmath179 , where @xmath109 should equal 1/2 or 1/3 .",
    "thus @xmath99 , and , for @xmath116 , only positive @xmath117 is expected .",
    "however , we observed characteristic minima of @xmath104 , where not only @xmath74 but also @xmath75 seem to tend to 0 as @xmath20 from the insulating side .",
    "below @xmath74 , @xmath5 was observed to increase monotonically with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "the detailed analysis of this feature favors the discontinuous character of the mit at @xmath7 , in the sense of mott s original prediction of a finite minimum metallic conductivity .",
    "the question arises why a minimum metallic conductivity was found in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 , and previously in a - si@xmath0cr@xmath1 @xcite , but not in many of the other substances , e.g.  crystalline si : p , investigated so far .",
    "of course , at the present stage , one can not exclude the possibility of a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 and si : p belonging to different universality classes .",
    "simultaneously , however , the question arises as to whether an analysis using @xmath6 of previous experiments might reveal similar contradictions between standard description and experimental data as we found here .",
    "but , for the lack of sufficiently detailed information on these investigations , this question has to be postponed to future studies .",
    "such analyses should be highly interesting since samples with @xmath180 and negative @xmath117 at the lowest @xmath4 were also found in experiments on crystalline si : as @xcite and si:(p , b ) @xcite , on amorphous si@xmath0cr@xmath1 @xcite and si@xmath0mn@xmath1 @xcite , as well as on granular al - ge @xcite .",
    "but there is also one case in the literature , where , for such a sample , @xmath5 first increases and then clearly decreases as @xmath4 vanishes : the a - cr - sio@xmath1 sample 7 in ref .",
    "( see fig .  2 of that work ) .",
    "moreover , to the best of our knowledge , none of the experiments , which are interpreted as proof of the continuity of the mit at @xmath7 , excludes that the `` metallic '' samples very close to the mit could be insulating with a characteristic hopping temperature smaller than the lowest experimentally accessible @xmath4 @xcite .    additionally to the result concerning the character of the mit",
    ", we consider the following points as important conclusions : +  although both the sample sets a and b , prepared with different technologies , differ significantly concerning @xmath8 , their critical ni concentrations are close : @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , related to our rbs scale . +  a high-@xmath4 mechanism , which `` survives '' the transition , masks the specific localization features to a large extent in both sample sets .",
    "it remains relevant down to temperatures of several hundred mk .",
    "thus determining theoretical parameters by fitting conductivity formulae which account only for one mechanism is not justified for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 within the considered @xmath181 region .",
    "+  for a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 also , it is possible to prepare metallic samples with the conductivity increasing with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "however , the influence of the mechanism from which this feature originates is weak , and it is directly visible only for certain preparation conditions .",
    "we would also like to stress a technological consequence of our stm investigations : when evaporating from two crucibles , the surface roughness of the films is large enough to lead to substantial concentration fluctuations on a mesoscopic length scale , caused by fluctuating incidence angles . to what extent",
    "these fluctuations are washed out by diffusion is an open question .    finally , we turn to the question of what can be learned concerning the nature of the mit in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 from the phenomenological results obtained above .",
    "our findings are in disagreement with conclusions drawn from the treatment of the mit in terms of one - parameter scaling theory @xcite of anderson localization of non - interacting electrons .",
    "but , on their own , they can not explain why this description fails .",
    "for example , they do not tell us whether it is because electron - electron interaction had to be taken into account , nor whether two ( or even more ) scaling parameters would be needed to get an adequate result .",
    "therefore , measurements of other quantities have to be consulted .",
    "xps , ups , and xes studies @xcite , as well as optical measurements @xcite have shown how the gap in the density of states shrinks and finally closes with increasing ni content , and how the fermi energy is shifted in this process .",
    "however , for reasons of resolution , such experiments do not yield information on the important immediate vicinity of the mit since the characteristic energy ( temperature ) of the hopping conduction vanishes as @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 from below .",
    "a helpful hint comes from low-@xmath4 hopping conduction deep in the insulating region @xcite  there , it has a far stronger influence on @xmath5 than the high - temperature mechanism which survives the mit .",
    "since the value of the hopping exponent @xmath141 in the approximation @xmath182 is close to 1/2 , and thus considerably exceeds mott s result 1/4 for non - interacting electrons @xcite , electron - electron interaction probably is important  the question whether or not this value can be interpreted in terms of hopping in the coulomb gap is still under controversial debate , see e.g.  .",
    "thus , it seems likely that the mit arises from interwoven localization and electron - electron interaction processes , cf .  the speculations in ref .  .",
    "a theoretical approach in this direction was very recently published by chitra and kotliar @xcite .",
    "these authors incorporate the _ long - range _ coulomb interaction into dynamical mean - field theory , and obtain the result that the mit should be discontinuous in two- and three - dimensional systems . however ,",
    "if this hypothesis is true , we would be left with a new puzzle : why does mott s estimate of the minimum metallic conductivity , the derivation @xcite of which neglects electron - electron interaction , still yield a reasonable value for @xmath166 in a - si@xmath0ni@xmath1 ?",
