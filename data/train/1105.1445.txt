    "simulation of urban traffic flow has shown to be of prime importance for optimisation and control purposes as the number of vehicles increases continuously and traffic conditions deteriorate .",

    "@xcite , we have modelled the traffic flow at a single intersection with open boundary conditions applied to the streets . in a recent study ,",
    "a single intersection operating under fixed time and traffic responsive schemes has been explored with closed boundary condition @xcite . in the mentioned papers cars",
    "were restricted to move straightly and not allowed to change their directions when they reach to the intersection . in this work",
    "we incorporate the possibility of turning .",
    "this incorporation constitutes a crucial step for a more realistic description of traffic flow and would certainly help us in a proper coordination of traffic lights .",
    "consider the traffic flow at the intersection of two streets .",
    "each street conducts a uni directional flow and has a single lane . here for simplicity we exclude the possibility of overtaking which requires having more than one lane and some laws for lane - changing @xcite .",
    "the flow directions are taken south - north in street one and east - west in street two .",
    "vehicles can turn when reaching to the intersection .",
    "a northward moving car can turn left and a westward moving car can turn right ( towards north ) when reaching to the intersection .",
    "we model each street by a chain of @xmath0 sites .",
    "these perpendicular chains intersect each other at the middle sites @xmath1 ( see fig.1 for illustration ) .",

    "correspondingly the probability of turning a west - moving car to north is denoted by @xmath9 .        at each step of time ,",
    "the system is characterized by the position and velocity configurations of cars .",
    "the system evolves under the nagel - schreckenberg ( ns ) dynamics @xcite .",
    "let us now specify the physical values of our time and space units .",
    "the length of each car , @xmath10 , is taken 4.5 metres .",
    "therefore , the spatial grid @xmath3 ( cell length ) equals to @xmath11 .",

    "in addition , each discrete increment of velocity signifies a value of @xmath14 which is also equivalent to the acceleration value .",

    "a set of traffic lights controls the traffic flow in a fixed - time scheme as follows .      in this scheme",
    "the traffic lights periodically turn into red and green .",
    "the period @xmath19 , hereafter referred to as _ cycle time _",
    ", is divided into two phases . in the first phase with duration @xmath20 ,",
    "the lights are green for the westward street and red for the northward one . in the second phase which lasts for @xmath21 time steps the lights change their colour and become red for the northward and green for the westward street .",
    "the gap of all cars are updated with their leader vehicle except the ones ( in each street ) which are the nearest approaching cars to the intersection .",
    "these two cars need special attention . for these cars gap",
    "should be adjusted with the signal in its red phase . in this case",
    ", the gap is defined as the number of cells immediately after the car s head to the intersection point @xmath22 .",
    "if the head position of the approaching car lies in the crossing point the gap is zero .",
    "note that for @xmath23 at a time step when a light goes red for a direction , portion of a passing car from that direction can occupy the crossing point . in this case",
    "the leading car of the queue in the other direction should wait until the passing car from the crossing point completely passes the intersection i.e. ; its tail cell position become larger than @xmath22 .",
    "to model car turning we proceed as follows : once a car becomes approaching to the intersection we draw a random number @xmath24 ( uniformly chosen from the unit interval ) .",
    "if @xmath24 is less than the corresponding turning probability the car turning label becomes one otherwise it remains zero .",
    "in the subsequent time steps the approaching car s gap is adjusted appropriately : if its turning label is zero its gap is adjusted via its forward leading car otherwise if its turning label is one the gap is adjusted via the first car in the perpendicular direction which has already passed the intersection ( see figure 2 ) . +          the type of boundary condition we implement in this paper is _",
    "open_. the reason is that if one tries to imply close type boundary condition , after some time steps most of the cars will appear in that street which has a higher turning probability into it .",
    "this effect arises because of accumulation of cars in the street with higher inward turning probability .",
    "to avoid such spurious effect which is surely contradicting to what occurs in reality we impose open boundary condition .",
    "this type of boundary condition is more compatible to realistic traffic flow . for this purpose ,",

    "the removal of cars from a street is modelled as follows : when the position of a car which has passed the intersection becomes larger than @xmath31 this car is removed from the system and the number of exited cars is increased by one correspondingly . the output current from street @xmath28",

    "other characteristics are analogous to the case @xmath58 .",

    "another important parameter for optimisation of the traffic flow at intersections are aggregate waiting times of cars stopping at queues formed in the red cycle of the traffic lights . in our model this total waiting time , denoted by @xmath65 onwards , can be simply be evaluated .",

    "the corresponding results differ quantitatively and in some case qualitatively .",
    "seeking for advanced models properly designated for modelling the behaviours of drivers at intersections is inevitable and unavoidable .",
    "we would like to end by emphasizing on the role of empirical data for adjusting the parameters of any intersection traffic model . despite",
    "utilising multi - cell occupation can render the deceleration / acceleration value of moving cars to a realist one , the behaviour of halted cars in the queue when the light goes green is still suffering from a satisfactory modelling ."
