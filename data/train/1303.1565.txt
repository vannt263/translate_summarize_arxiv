    "understanding the origin of this diversity is an important goal of present research .",
    "the type ii class of sne events display spectroscopic signatures of hydrogen , and appear in at least three sub - classes .",

    "lastly , the iin sub - class shows spectral features that are much narrower than in the other sub - classes , thought to be a result of strong interaction between sn ejecta and the circumstellar medium .",
    "other sub - classes include the iib ( with weak hydrogen spectral features that soon disappear ) , and ambiguous events collected under the generic ii - pec , or peculiar , sub - class .",
    "the iip population is important because it represents the most numerous sub - class , constituting about 75% of all type ii sne @xcite .",

    "the subluminous sne may occupy the lower mass end of this range @xcite , though comparatively few firm constraints exist .",
    "their low luminosities have been attributed either to low mass progenitors , or to fall back  events in which a massive progenitor gives rise to a black hole core and swallows a large fraction of the stellar material which would otherwise have escaped , thus limiting the observed luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for each of the irac1 and irac2 bands , the pre - explosion epoch image was subtracted from the post - discovery one to remove background structured emission from the host galaxy .",
    "source photometry was carried out in this subtracted image using a large aperture to encompass the total flux .",
    "conversion from image units to final fluxes was done using standard procedures and conversion factors . as a cross - check",

    "the bandpass difference between irac1 and  w1 is small and was ignored @xcite .",

    "given the short integrations of the single exposures ( 7.7 s ) , this does not appear to be consistent .",

    "no pre - explosion  image for subtraction is available , so photometry at the position of the sn was carried out directly on atlas and post - cryo images covering the sn position .    for the fully - calibrated atlas products , we used procedures recommended by the  team .",
    "small aperture photometry was carried out at the sn position as well as on bright nearby field stars with cataloged magnitudes used for relative calibration .",
    "the background was carefully selected using multiple adjacent apertures in order to avoid other point sources while encompassing local host galaxy emission .",
    "aperture corrections , as well as correlated and confusion noise estimation for uncertainty measurements were included according to the instructions in the  explanatory supplement .",
    "magnitudes were converted to fluxes using standard zeropoints @xcite .    the publicly - released atlas ( l3 ) image",
    "is made by coaddition of multiple exposures obtained in 2010 jan , plus some exposures taken in 2010 aug .",
    "we also produced our own coadded images for each of the three main epochs , starting from the l1b frames .",
    "first , the l1b data were sieved by removal of low quality frames affected by elevated background due to moon proximity and other artifacts .",

    "<S> we present a study of sn  2009js in ngc 918 . </S>",
    "<S> multi - band kanata optical photometry covering the first @xmath0120 days show the source to be a type iip sn . </S>",
    "<S> reddening is dominated by that due to our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> one - year - post - explosion photometry with the ntt , and a subaru optical spectrum 16 days post - discovery , both imply a good match with the well - studied subluminous sn  2005cs . </S>",
    "<S> the plateau phase luminosity of sn  2009js and its plateau duration are more similar to the intermediate luminosity iip sn  2008 in . </S>",
    "<S> thus , sn  2009js shares characteristics with both subluminous and intermediate luminosity sne . </S>",
    "<S> its radioactive tail luminosity lies between sn  2005cs and sn  2008 in , whereas its quasi - bolometric luminosity decline from peak to plateau ( quantified by a newly - defined parameter @xmath1log@xmath2 measuring adiabatic cooling following shock breakout ) is much smaller than both the others . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the ejected mass of @xmath3ni to be low ( @xmath00.007  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sn  explosion energy appears to have been small , similar to sn  2005cs . </S>",
    "<S> sn  2009js is the first subluminous sn  iip to be studied in the mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> it was serendipitously caught by  at very early times . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it was detected by  105 days later with a significant 4.6  flux excess above the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared excess luminosity relative to the photosphere is clearly smaller than that of sn  2004dj extensively studied in the mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the excess may be tentatively assigned to heated dust with mass @xmath03@xmath410@xmath5  , or to co fundamental emission as a precursor to dust formation .    </S>",
