    "following the pioneering discovery of the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser period doubling universality in unimodal maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite universality has been demonstrated to be a rather generic phenomenon in dynamics .",
    "such renormalization approach to universality has been very successful in one - dimensional dynamics , and has led to explanation of universality in unimodal maps @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , critical circle maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and holomorphic maps with a siegel disks @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    universality has been abundantly observed in higher dimensions , in particular , in two and more dimensional dissipative systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , in area - preserving maps , both as the period - doubling universality @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and as the universality associated with the break - up of invariant surfaces @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in hamiltonian flows @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the universal behavior in dissipative and conservative higher dimensional systems is fundamentally different .",
    "the case of of the dissipative systems is often reducible to the one - dimensional feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter case is very different , and at present there is no deep understanding of universality in conservative systems , other than in the `` trivial '' case of the universality for systems `` near integrability '' @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the study of the interesting cases of universality for maps and flows far from linear , is at present confined to numerics ( for instance , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) ) , or computer - assisted proofs @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the latter approach turned to be quite powerful , albeit rather specialized and time and effort consuming .",
    "very little analytic machinery exists for higher - dimensional maps and flows far from linear .",
    "an infinite period - doubling cascade in families of area - preserving maps was observed by several authors in early 80 s @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a typical period - doubling scenario can be illustrated with the area - preserving h ' enon family ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath5    maps in this family posses a fixed point @xmath6 which is stable for @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 this fixed point becomes unstable , at the same time an orbit of period two is born with @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "this orbit , in turn , becomes unstable at @xmath11 , giving birth to a period @xmath12 stable orbit .",
    "generally , there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath13 , at which the orbit of period @xmath14 turns unstable , while at the same time a stable orbit of period @xmath15 is born .",
    "the parameter values @xmath13 accumulate on some @xmath16 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the accumulation rate @xmath17 is universal for a large class of families , not necessarily hnon .",

    "<S> a renormalization approach has been used in a computer - assisted proof of existence of an area - preserving map with orbits of all binary periods in @xcite and @xcite . as it is the case with all non - trivial universality problems in non - dissipative systems in dimensions more than one , no analytic proof of this period doubling universality exists to date .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the period doubling renormalization fixed point for area - preserving maps is almost one dimensional , in the sense that it is close to the following hnon - like map : @xmath1 where @xmath2 solves @xmath3    we then give a `` proof '' of existence of solutions of small analytic perturbations of this one dimensional problem , and describe some of the properties of this solution . </S>",
    "<S> the `` proof '' consists of an analytic argument for factorized inverse branches of @xmath2 together with verification of several inequalities and inclusions of subsets of @xmath4 numerically .    finally , we suggest an analytic approach to the full period doubling problem for area - preserving maps based on its proximity to the one dimensional . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> the paper is an exploration of a possible analytic machinery for a non - trivial renormalization problem in a conservative two - dimensional system . </S>"
