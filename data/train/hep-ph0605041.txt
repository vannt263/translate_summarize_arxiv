    "<S> we investigate the effects of flavor su(3)-symmetry breaking on the quark , gluon , and mixed quark - gluon condensates , based on the nonlocal effective chiral action from the instanton vacuum . </S>",

    "<S> understanding the qcd vacuum is very complicated , since both perturbative and non - perturbative fluctuations come into play . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the quark and gluon condensates , being the lowest dimensional ones , characterize the non - perturbative structure of the qcd vacuum . the quark condensate is identified as the order parameter for spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking ( s@xmath5sb ) which plays an essential role in describing low - energy phenomena of hadrons : in the qcd sum rule , these condensates come from the operator product expansion and are related to hadronic observables  @xcite , while in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath5pt ) , the free parameter @xmath6 is introduced in the mass term of the effective chiral lagrangian at the leading order  @xcite measuring the strength of the quark condensate  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the gluon condensate is not the order parameter but measures the vacuum energy density  @xcite , which was first estimated by the charmonium sum rule  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the quark and gluon condensates are well understood phenomenologically , higher dimensional condensates suffer from large uncertainty . though it is still possible to estimate dimension - six four - quark condensates in terms of the quark condensate by using the factorization scheme which is justified in the large @xmath7 limit , the dimension - five mixed quark - gluon condensate is not easily determined phenomenologically . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the mixed condensate is an essential parameter to calculate baryon masses  @xcite , exotic hybrid mesons  @xcite , higher - twist meson distribution amplitudes  @xcite within the qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mixed quark condensate plays a role of an additional order parameter for s@xmath5sb , since the quark chirality flips via the quark - gluon operator . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is naturally expressed in terms of the quark condensate : @xmath8 with the dimensional parameter @xmath9 which was estimated in various works  @xcite and with the definition @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> the instanton picture allows us to study the qcd vacuum microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> since the instanton picture provides a natural mechanism for @xmath11sb due to the delocalization of single - instanton quark zero modes in the instanton medium , the quark condensate can be evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton vacuum is validated by the two parameters : the average instanton size @xmath12 and average inter - instanton distance @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these essential numbers were suggested by shuryak  @xcite within the instanton liquid model and were derived from @xmath14 by diakonov and petrov  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these values were recently confirmed by lattice qcd simulations @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ quark , gluon , and mixed quark - gluon condensates , based on the instanton liquid model for the qcd vacuum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model was later extended by introducing the current quark masses  @xcite . since we are interested in the effect of explicit flavor su(3)-symmetry breaking , we follow the formalism of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite in which the dependence of the dynamical quark mass on the current quark mass has been studied in detail . though the mixed quark - gluon condensate was already studied in the instanton vacuum  @xcite , explicit su(3)-symmetry breaking was not considered . </S>",

    "<S> we will show that with a proper choice of the @xmath0 dependence of the dynamical quark mass  @xcite the gluon condensate is independent of @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> it indicates that it is essential to have the @xmath0-correction factor @xmath98 in order to consider su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking properly . in table  </S>",
    "<S> [ table1 ] we list the values of the gluon condensate when @xmath99 mev and @xmath100 mev with and without @xmath98 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the value of @xmath9 increases as @xmath0 does , which implies that the mixed condensate is less sensitive to the @xmath0 than the quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath9 are in the range of @xmath101 for the strange quark and of @xmath102 for the up quark . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the strange @xmath103 turns out to be larger than the nonstrange @xmath104 by about @xmath105 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the scale dependence of the condensates . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath106^{\\gamma_1/b}\\langle\\mathcal{o}_1(\\mu_b )   \\rangle,\\,\\,\\,\\langle\\mathcal{o}_2(\\mu_a)\\rangle=\\left [   \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_b)}{\\alpha_s(\\mu_a)}\\right]^{\\gamma_2/b }   \\langle\\mathcal{o}_2(\\mu_b)\\rangle ,    \\label{norm}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath95 and @xmath107 indicate different generic operators corresponding to the condensates in which we are interested . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote two different renormalization scales of the operators . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is the corresponding anomalous dimension for the condensates . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath110 is defined as @xmath111 and becomes @xmath112 in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> taking the ratio of the operators @xmath95 and @xmath107 , we have : @xmath113^ {   ( \\gamma_1-\\gamma_2)/b}\\frac{\\langle\\mathcal{o}_1(\\mu_b)\\rangle } {   \\langle\\mathcal{o}_2(\\mu_b)\\rangle}.   \\label{norm1}\\ ] ] if @xmath114 and @xmath115 stand for the mixed and quark condensates respectively , we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 resulting in @xmath118 . on the contrary , we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath121 shows relatively strong dependence on the scale , whereas the quark and mixed condensates are less influenced by the scaling . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath9 depends more strongly on the scale .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to mention that the relation between the mixed condensate and the expectation value of the transverse momentum for the leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this relation can be written as follows : @xmath122 considering @xmath121 for the light quarks in table  [ table4 ] ( @xmath123 ) , we get @xmath124 . note that the value estimated here is in qualitatively good agreement with that calculated directly from the pseudoscalar meson light - cone distribution amplitude within the same framework  @xcite ; @xmath125 .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the various qcd vacuum condensates within the framework of the instanton liquid model , emphasizing the effects of flavor su(3)-symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the modified improved action elaborated by musakhanov was used for this purpose . in the modified improved action , </S>",
    "<S> the current quark mass appeared explicitly in the denominator of the quark propagator as well as in the dynamical quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we were able to take into account the current quark mass effects to the qcd condensates . in order to consider the @xmath126 dependence of the dynamical quark mass </S>",
    "<S> , we employed the @xmath0-correction factor . </S>",
    "<S> it arises from the resummation of the qcd planar loops in the large @xmath7 limit and is parameterized to satisfy the saddle - point equation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we observed that the gluon condensate is almost independent of the current quark mass when the strange current quark correction factor is introduced , whereas it increases monotonically without it . </S>",
    "<S> the quark and mixed condensates were also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the results were consistent with those from other model calculations as well as phenomenological values . in particular , the ratios of the condensates between the strange and up quarks were also investigated : @xmath127^{1/5}$ ] and @xmath128^{1/3}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that the results are again compatible with other theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensional quantity @xmath129 was also studied : @xmath130 and @xmath131 . in general , the quark and mixed condensates decrease as the current quark mass increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath9 increases as the current quark mass does , which indicates that the mixed condensate is less sensitive to the current quark mass than the quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also presented the relation of the @xmath9 to the expectation value of the transverse momentum for the leading - twist pion light - cone distribution amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> though we considered the effects of flavor su(3)-symmetry breaking on various condensates , we did not take into account those from meson - loop corrections which are known to be of importance . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding investigation is under way . </S>"
