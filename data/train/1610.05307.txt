    "single white dwarf planetary systems provide unparallelled insights into planet formation and long - term dynamics .",
    "rocky debris is found in the atmospheres of between one - quarter and one - half of all known single milky way white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition of this debris can be compared directly to solar system asteroid families , and primarily reflect the inner solar system @xcite .",
    "detected around a few per cent of these `` polluted '' white dwarfs are dusty circumstellar discs @xcite  some of which contain gaseous components @xcite  and one white dwarf ( wd 1145 + 017 ) features at least one actively disintegrating minor planet @xcite .    in a system - wide case of pinball @xcite , planets are thought to represent a necessary perturbing presence for asteroids , moons or rocky debris to be thrust towards the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "as objects encounter the white dwarf roche , or disruption radius , they break up and form a disc @xcite and eventually accrete onto the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "although the planets themselves rarely collide with the white dwarf @xcite , they are necessary agents to transport smaller debris towards the star .    the above behaviour need not be restricted to single stars .",
    "circumstellar metal pollution , debris discs and disintegrating asteroids should all occur in some fraction of binary star planetary systems as well @xcite .",
    "planets themselves may be common in binary star systems . above 140 exoplanets",
    "are known to reside in these systems , and about four - fifths of those feature a single planet - host star .",
    "although a significant body of work has attempted to understand the formation and evolution of these exoplanets , little attention has been given to their fates @xcite .",
    "further , despite the more common case of exoplanets in `` circumstellar '' configurations ( orbiting one star ) , the rarer `` circumbinary '' case ( e.g. @xcite ) has received the lion s share of investigations assessing post - main - sequence fate @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar case , in addition to being more common than the circumbinary case , can yield more insights .",
    "if binary stars are separated by more than a few tens of au , then they evolve effectively independently of each other .",
    "after one of these stars has become a white dwarf , this separation is large enough to ensure that the companion s wind provides a negligible chemical change to the white dwarf s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "consequently , one can link this white dwarf with the characteristics of a single white dwarf planetary system .    here",
    ", we address the dearth of work investigating circumstellar planetary systems within evolved binaries by estimating a stability limit for a relatively simple but important base case .",
    "we consider two nearly coplanar planets in each system , as opposed to the single planet cases from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the high mutual inclinations between the binary star and planetary system in @xcite .",
    "our focus is also entirely different .",
    "@xcite detailed how a planet may `` hop '' from one star to the other during post - main - sequence mass loss , and @xcite illustrated how the combination of galactic tides and post - main - sequence mass loss conspire to stretch the orbits of stellar binaries such that a previously quiescent planet becomes suddenly dynamically active .",
    "our two planets orbit the same star at distances commensurate with those of solar system giant planets , which precludes star hopping .",
    "our initial binary separation is no greater than 500 au , rendering galactic tides ineffective .",
    "consequently , our focus is on the stellar phase - dependent stability of the resulting four - body system .",
    "we determine simply the binary separation within which the two - planet system becomes unstable during their host star s main sequence , giant branch and white dwarf phases , rather than introducing more complex considerations such as lidov - kozai oscillations or accretion rate estimations @xcite . in section 2",
    "we briefly recapitulate some relevant stability results , before in section 3 detailing the initial conditions for our simulations .",
    "we present our results in section 4 and conclude in section 5 .",
    "unlike the three - body problem , for which many analytic formulations of stability exist ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar concise expressions for four - body problems are rarer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even despite major recent progress with central configuration theory @xcite .",
    "further , when one of the bodies loses mass  as is the case for a main - sequence star which becomes a white dwarf  then not even the two - body problem is solvable ( see chapter 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "these restrictions persuade us to construct binary systems based on our knowledge of the three - body problem with mass loss .",
    "two - planet systems where the central star evolves into a white dwarf were the focus of investigations by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a key finding from @xcite was that two planets which are hill stable on the main sequence  meaning that their orbits could never cross  might no longer be hill stable as the central star loses mass .",
    "@xcite then expanded on that work with a wider exploration of parameter space , and by also considering lagrange stability , which is the dynamical state of two hill stable planets that remain bounded and ordered .",
    "@xcite explored the evolution of two planets in mean motion resonances , and the `` non - adiabatic '' orbital variations resulting from violent mass loss .",
    "the adiabaticity of a system is defined here as the extent to which its planets orbits change in a predictable manner due to stellar mass loss : when the eccentricity variations are negligible and the semimajor axes values increase in direct proportion to the extent of the mass loss .",
    "adiabaticity is quantified by a formula like that of equation ( 15 ) of @xcite , which represents a scaled ratio of the orbital period to the mass loss timescale . when this ratio is much less than unity ,",
    "the system is said to be adiabatic .",
    "@xcite showed that any stellar companion within several hundred au will evolve adiabatically .",
    "the stability boundary changes found by @xcite and @xcite hence considered only the adiabatic state because that corresponds to the expected fate of the majority of currently - known exoplanetary systems .",
    "the hill stability limit and probably the lagrange stability limit are scale - free in the sense that they depend on ratios of orbital elements of the planets rather than the explicit planet - star separations themselves @xcite .",
    "this property is particularly useful for studies such as this one in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the explored systems and to place the planets well - beyond the tidal reach of the evolving star @xcite .",
    "however , after instability does occur , the problem no longer remains scale - free @xcite .    of particular interest here",
    "are two - planet systems which are sufficiently lagrange stable around a single star to survive gyrs into the white dwarf phase , but not under the influence of a binary companion .",
    "stellar mass loss will expand the orbits of both planets relative to their initial values more than the orbit of the binary companion ( even though all expansions are adiabatic ; see equation 3 of @xcite , equations a22-a23 of @xcite and equations 7.6 - 7.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , because angular momentum must be conserved ( assuming isotropic mass loss ) , the post - mass - loss state of the system leaves it more fragile and susceptible to instability than on the main sequence .",
    "the above considerations motivate our initial conditions , which are measured in jacobi coordinates .",
    "assume that the primary star is the planet - hosting star and evolves from a main sequence star to a white dwarf .",
    "denote its mass as @xmath0 .",
    "the two planets it hosts have masses @xmath1 an @xmath2 and semimajor axes @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 . the binary stellar companion , which will be denoted as the `` secondary '' , has mass @xmath6 and a semimajor axis of @xmath7 .",
    "the secondary s mass is time - independent because it is assumed ( i ) to be low enough such that it remains on the main sequence for the duration of our simulations , and ( ii ) mass loss from main sequence winds is negligible . in fig .",
    "[ cart ] , we show a cartoon of the bodies in our simulations and how they would evolve in time in a stable manner .    the large phase space of the four - body problem , combined with the time - consuming nature of the simulations that extend beyond the main sequence , demanded that we carefully chose what parameters to explore .",
    "we focused on @xmath7 and minimally sampled variations of other parameters .",
    "we fixed @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which corresponds to a k2 star by appendix b of @xcite .",
    "using that same table we sampled both a0 stars ( @xmath10 ) and f0 stars ( @xmath11 ) for our primary .",
    "these choices allowed us to evolve the primary star through all phases of stellar evolution while the secondary remained on the main sequence .",
    "the main sequence lifetimes of a0 , f0 and k2 stars are respectively , roughly @xmath12 , @xmath13 and  @xmath14  @xmath15  gyr ; the a0 and f0 stars turn into white dwarfs with masses of about @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite . both a0 and f0 stars represent common progenitors of the present - day population of white dwarfs in the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we set @xmath18 au and sampled three values of @xmath19 corresponding to 8 , 10 and 20 times the mutual hill radius ( @xmath20 ) , as defined by @xcite . for a0 stars ,",
    "these values correspond to @xmath21 au , whereas for f0 stars , they correspond to @xmath22 au .",
    "the resulting semimajor axis ratios are far from any strong orbital period commensurability , and large enough to ensure hill stability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and probably lagrange stability @xcite , _ both _ along the main sequence and white dwarf phases @xcite .",
    "further , because @xmath23 during all phases , the breakdown of these limits for sufficiently high planet masses @xcite is not consequential here .",
    "we then set the planetary initial orbital eccentricities to zero .",
    "these choices help us focus on determining the global stability boundary as a function of @xmath24 and not deplete resources by modelling already - unstable two - planet , one - star systems .",
    "we sampled up to eleven different values of @xmath24 for a given set of mass and planetary separations , and adopted the range @xmath25 .",
    "for stability considerations , the absolute value of @xmath26 is not as important as the ratio @xmath27 , through which we report our results .",
    "however , the upper bound of @xmath26 is important because it is low enough that we can justify ignoring the effect of galactic tides and stellar flybys @xcite .",
    "although our focus was on circular binary orbits , we also performed simulations with nonzero binary eccentricities ( @xmath28 ) of 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.8 .",
    "due to the chaotic nature of long - term evolution simulations of planetary systems , we did not wish to perform just one simulation for each set of masses , semimajor axes and eccentricities sampled .",
    "instead we performed four per set . within each of the four simulations , for the two planets and the binary companion , we randomly selected , from a uniform distribution , mean anomalies , arguments of pericentre and longitudes of ascending node across their entire ranges , and inclinations between @xmath29 and @xmath30 . effectively , both stars and both planets are all nearly coplanar .      in order to simulate system evolution across all stellar phases , we needed to concurrently propagate the orbital evolution of the planets and binary star with the physical evolution of the primary . a currently available tool which is well - suited for this purpose is the modified version of the bulirsch - stoer integrator from the mercury integration package @xcite .",
    "the modifications were detailed in @xcite and involve splicing the mass and radius output from the sse stellar evolution code @xcite within each burlisch - stoer substep in order to determine each global timestep .",
    "the consequence is that tens or hundreds of timesteps are needed to resolve a single orbit of the inner planet .",
    "long - term integrations are hence time - consuming .",
    "we integrated our simulations for 14 gyr , which is the current age of the universe ( also known as a hubble time ) , and were able to perform a total of about 700 simulations with two stars and two planets .",
    "we then repeated all simulations but with the binary star removed .",
    "doing so provided a necessary contrast in order to isolate the binary influence .    because the primary was treated as a point particle with a variable mass , mass loss is effectively treated as isotropic , a well - used and justified approximation @xcite .",
    "the ejection distance is computed using the galactic tidal model from @xcite and assuming that the stars reside at a distance of 8 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "this ejection boundary takes the form of an ellipsoid , and an ejection was deemed to occur when the code detected that a planet resided outside of this ellipsoid .",
    "the ellipsoid itself changes shape as the primary loses mass ; this change was tracked by our code .",
    "the primary was evolved assuming solar metallicity , a reimers mass loss numerical coefficient of @xmath31  yr@xmath32 for the classic prescription @xcite , and , along the asymptotic giant branch , the superwind prescription of @xcite .",
    "our goal is to link binary separation with stability .",
    "we define an unstable system as one which has experienced an ejection or collision . in our simulations ,",
    "the collisions occurred either between two planets or between a planet and the primary ( the planetary radius was equivalent to that of jupiter and the stellar radii were given by _ sse _ ) .",
    "only planets were ever ejected : all secondaries remained bound to the primary .",
    "every one of our set of simulations with no secondary remained stable for 14 gyr , providing a useful point of comparison and confirming that our choices of @xmath33 and @xmath19 were lagrange - stable in the single - star case .",
    "we classified simulation outcomes according to four types , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ tabsum ] .",
    "each type is colour - coded for easy linkage to our main result , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ mainplot ] .",
    "the types are : ( green ) stable throughout the simulation ; ( blue ) stable until some point along the white dwarf stage ; ( purple ) stable until the transition period between the end of the giant branch and start of the white dwarf phase ; ( red ) unstable during the main sequence or giant branch phases .",
    "we define the transition period as the 10 myr span which is bisected by the exact time when the star becomes a white dwarf ( 964 myr for a0 stars and 2270 myr for f0 stars , according to @xcite ) .",
    "this transition period includes the tip of the asymptotic giant branch , where the `` superwind '' @xcite is strongest .",
    "consequently , instability is common during this time ( e.g. see appendix a of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the transition between the main sequence and giant branch phases is gradual and not dynamically noteworthy .",
    "the instability fractions given in fig .",
    "[ tabsum ] indicate that the majority of instability in all cases occurs in the form of ejections .",
    "this fraction is above 90 per cent for systems which become unstable during the white dwarf phase .",
    "just a few per cent of white dwarf unstable systems feature planet - primary collisions , although this value might be an underestimate because no tidal effects were included in the simulations , and because collisions were determined according to the actual white dwarf radius as opposed to its roche , or disruption , radius .",
    "those fractions are further slightly blighted by small number statistics ( 90 total blue instabilities , as opposed to 148 red and 217 purple ones ) .      our main result , in fig .",
    "[ mainplot ] , illustrates when instability occurs in binary separation space .",
    "each square represents the mean outcome of four sets of simulations run with different mean anomalies , longitudes of pericentre and arguments of ascending node .",
    "the mean is computed by a colour - blend of the four outcomes , where the colours associated with each outcome are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tabsum ] .",
    "the bubble in the upper - left corner of each plot indicates the primary stellar type , and the initial separation of planets in mutual hill radii ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "overall , the figure illustrates a trend from red ( main sequence instability ) to green ( stability ) as the binary separation increases , an expected result . because the colour trend is not strictly monotonic",
    "( e.g. left side of the upper - rightmost plot ) and computational limitations prevent us from covering the entire phase space , we can not identify specific values of @xmath27 for which transitions in behaviour occur .",
    "nevertheless , we can still establish some fairly robust estimates .",
    "consider first the case for circular binaries . in all cases",
    "the systems are stable for @xmath34 , and probably @xmath35 given the bounding @xmath36 and @xmath37 cases .",
    "if not stable , then the system is likely to survive over the entire main sequence and giant branch phases , but is unlikely to survive intact well into the white dwarf phase : the transition from giant branch star into a white dwarf triggers instability unless @xmath38 .",
    "the same relations can not be used for more eccentric binary cases .",
    "the critical separation for stability across all phases increases with increasing @xmath39 . for moderate eccentricity cases ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 , stability",
    "is always achieved for @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , for this semimajor axis ratio and @xmath43 , instability is achieved predominately along the white dwarf phase .",
    "highly eccentric binaries appear to stretch out the instability regimes across a wider swath of @xmath44 space , which fortuitously allows one to more easily select initial conditions with predictable outcomes .    in order to aid estimation of the phase space region where the transition from stable ( green ) to unstable ( all other colours ) occurs for non - zero binary eccentricity",
    ", we provide rough empirical estimates in equation form .",
    "we find that stability is achieved if the following is satisfied :    @xmath45 } - 1         & \\text{if } \\",
    "\\beta= 8 ,       \\\\[2ex ]    0.55 \\ln{\\left[\\frac{a_{\\rm b}(0)}{a_2(0)}\\right ] } - 1           & \\text{if } \\ \\beta= 10 , 20 \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    @xmath46    for @xmath47 .",
    "we have drawn these curves on all of the plots in fig .",
    "[ mainplot ] .",
    "we can also compare results for both types of primary star studied ( left and right panels ) .",
    "the agreement is good enough in nearly all cases ( but not necessarily the @xmath37 , @xmath48 case ) to conclude that the stability limits change little depending on which type of star in the a - f spectral type range which is used .",
    "this robustness provides evidence that adopting a single primary mass may be sufficient for future investigations .",
    "instability in multi - planet systems , partly through eccentricity generation , may easily yield configurations which can lead to white dwarf pollution , as detailed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , what about simulations which remain stable throughout all stellar phases but are still perturbed due to the presence of a secondary ? in the single - star case , figure 8 of @xcite illustrates that for their stable simulations , mutual interactions of three planets during mass loss can raise eccentricities up to 0.2 .",
    "@xcite used a different integrator and found that eccentricity variations can easily reach several tenths ( see , in particular , their figs .",
    "16 - 17 ) .    here",
    ", our green - coloured simulations allow us to evaluate how high the planetary eccentricities become on the white dwarf phase for stable simulations .",
    "we find that in extreme cases , planet eccentricities can reach values of about 0.1 from main sequence maximum values of 0.01 .",
    "our more muted excitation probably arises from the fact that we have adopted much less massive stars than @xcite and @xcite , who partly used particularly violent and rare @xmath49 ( b2 ) primary stars .",
    "further , if our secondary was too far away to ever trigger instability , then its effect on the planetary eccentricity was not great enough to raise it to 0.1 . analytical explanations for three - body ( and four - body ) dynamics during stellar mass loss is sorely in need of future exploration , and appears to not represent a simple extension of two - body dynamics .. in this situation , there are no multi - planet interactions . ]",
    "whatever eccentricity excitation occurs during mass loss , after the star has become a white dwarf , then the system again becomes a fixed - mass system for which other theories may be applicable .",
    "one option is laplace - lagrange secular theory ( chapter 7 of @xcite ) , which is sufficient for a first evaluation of the dynamics of a system .",
    "however , this theory is of low order in the masses , eccentricities and semimajor axis ratio @xmath50 .",
    "hence , it may give reasonable results for problems in our solar sytem but typically not in exoplanetary systems ( where eccentricities may be high and semimajor axis ratios small ) or for planets in stellar binaries .",
    "in that latter case , there are several studies that perform expansions to second order in the masses and develop solutions for higher values in the eccentricities and in the semimajor axis ratio ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can describe the dynamics of the system more accurately . of course , as the above studies refer to three - body systems , they could only be used if our four - body system could be approximated by a three - body one ( as for example where the companion star is sufficiently distant to be considered as having a negligible influence on the orbital evolution of the two planets ) .",
    "motivated by the fact that planetary origins of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres are not necessarily limited to single white dwarfs @xcite , we have probed stability limits in evolving circumstellar two - planet systems with non - evolving secondaries .",
    "we found that for circular binaries , if the planets are sufficiently far from their parent star to avoid engulfment on the giant branch phase , then @xmath51 ensures stability across all phases of stellar evolution .",
    "instability during the white dwarf phase occurs for an increasing spread of @xmath44 values as @xmath28 increases . our results ( fig .",
    "[ mainplot ] ) ( i ) provide useful benchmarks from which one could set up simulations that generate instability along particular phases , ( ii ) display phase space portraits which can be compared to observed systems , and ( iii ) represent a starting point for explorations of more complex architectures with asteroids , moons , additional planets and/or significantly inclined bodies .",
