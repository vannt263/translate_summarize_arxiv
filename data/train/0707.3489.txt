    "furthermore , the derivatives of the functor @xmath15 were described , without proof , and certain homotopy invariance properties of the derivatives , together with the aforementioned splitting result , were used to prove a statement about the rational homology invariance of @xmath16 . the goal of this paper is to describe , with proofs , the derivatives of the functor @xmath17 .",

    "in fact , we will , in some sense , describe the taylor polynomials ( as opposed to just the layers ) of this functor in the case when @xmath1 is a nice open submanifold of a euclidean space .    before we can state our main result ( theorem  [ t : maintheorem ] below )",

    "similarly , we say that a functor on manifolds @xmath21 is polynomial ( or homogeneous ) , if the associated functor on vector spaces @xmath26 is polynomial ( or homogeneous ) in the sense of @xcite , for all manifolds @xmath1 .",

    "the category @xmath61 is instrumental in our description of the @xmath5-th homogeneous layer of @xmath37 .",
    "an explicit description of @xmath61 for @xmath62 is given example  [ ex : thecategorye_n ] , and there is a more general discussion of the structure of @xmath61 in remark  [ r : structureofe_n ] .",
    "next , we will define two functors on @xmath61 , one covariant and one contravariant .",
    "the first functor has to do with posets of partitions .",
    "let @xmath44 be two partitions _ of the same set _ @xmath39 .",
    "we say that @xmath45 is a _ refinement _ of @xmath38 ( or , equivalently , that @xmath38 is a coarsening of @xmath45 ) if every component of @xmath45 is a subset of some component of @xmath38 .",
    "in this case we also write that @xmath63 .",
    "the relation of refinement is a partial ordering on the set of partitions of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the poset of partitions of the standard set with @xmath5-elements .",
    "@xmath64 has both an initial and a final object , which we denote @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( the indiscrete and the discrete partition respectively ) .",
    "therefore the geometric realization of @xmath64 , which we denote by @xmath67 , is contractible ( for two reasons , as it were ) .",
    "inside the simplicial nerve of @xmath64 , consider the simplicial subset consisting of those simplices that do not contain both @xmath65 and @xmath66 as a vertex .",
    "we denote the geometric realization of this simplicial subset by @xmath68 .",
    "it is a sub - complex of @xmath67 , and it does geometrically look like the boundary of this contractible polyhedron . define @xmath69 to be the quotient space @xmath70 .",
    "obviously , @xmath69 has a natural action of @xmath71 .",
    "it is well - known that non - equivariantly , @xmath72    this is not the first time that the spaces @xmath69 play a role in calculus of functors .",
    "the spanier - whitehead dual of @xmath69 is the @xmath5-th goodwillie derivative of the identity functor on the category @xmath73 .",
    "note however the following difference : previously , the spaces @xmath69 occurred in the derivatives of a functor with values in @xmath73 , while this time they occur in the derivatives of a functor with values in suspension spectra , namely @xmath74 .",
    "now let us generalize the construction @xmath64 as follows : for a partition @xmath38 of @xmath39 , let @xmath75 be the poset of all partitions of @xmath39 that are refinements of @xmath38 .",
    "again , @xmath75 has both an initial object and a final object .",
    "define the subcomplex @xmath76 analogously to @xmath68 , and let @xmath77 suppose that @xmath38 has components of sizes @xmath78 .",
    "it is not hard to see that in this case there is a homeomorphism @xmath79 which describes the homotopy type of @xmath80 in the general case .",
    "note that @xmath80 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension @xmath53 .",
    "now let @xmath55 be a morphism in @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath43 induces a map of posets ( which we denote by the same letter ) @xmath81 by the formula @xmath82 .",
    "it follows that @xmath43 induces a map of spaces @xmath83 ( this much would be true for any fusion @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is also true that @xmath43 takes boundary to boundary , i.e. , @xmath43 restricts to a map @xmath84 ( this is only true if @xmath43 is a strict fusion ) .",
    "thus , we have a covariant functor from the category @xmath61 to the category of pairs of spaces @xmath85 by passing to quotient spaces , we also obtain a functor from @xmath61 to pointed spaces @xmath86    next we need to introduce another , contravariant , functor on @xmath61 .",
    "it is well known that the poset of partitions of @xmath39 is a lattice , in the sense that any two partitions @xmath38 and @xmath87 of @xmath39 have a coarsest common refinement , denoted @xmath88 and a finest common coarsening , denoted @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a partition of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath87 be another partition of @xmath39 .",
    "for a partition @xmath38 , let @xmath90 be the set of components of @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath38 defines a natural partition of the set @xmath91 : two elements of @xmath91 are equivalent if they belong to the same component of @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to see that the map of sets @xmath93 , associated with the partition @xmath87 , defines a natural fusion of @xmath38 into this partition of @xmath91 .",
    "now comes the crucial definition : we say that @xmath87 is _ good _ relative to @xmath38 if the above fusion is a strict fusion .",
    "otherwise , we say that @xmath87 is _ bad _ relative to @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth manifold .",
    "when @xmath38 is a partition of @xmath39 , we use the notation @xmath94 to mean @xmath95 .",
    "this is the space of maps from @xmath38 to @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 is represented by the surjection @xmath96 .",
    "the surjection induces an inclusion map @xmath97 .",
    "we identify @xmath98 with its image in @xmath95 .",
    "this is the diagonal subspace of @xmath95 associated with @xmath38 .",
    "now define the space @xmath99 as follows @xmath100 in words , @xmath101 is the union of diagonals that are bad relative to @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath55 be a morphism in @xmath61 .",
    "clearly , @xmath43 gives rise to a map @xmath102 .",
    "it also is true that this map restricts to a map @xmath103 .",
    "thus we have a contravariant functor from @xmath61 to pairs of spaces @xmath104    given the category @xmath61 and a ( contravariant ) functor from @xmath61 to spaces , we can assemble this data by means of the following standard construction .",
    "define @xmath105 to be the topological category where an object is a pair of the form @xmath106 where @xmath38 is an object of @xmath61 , and @xmath107 is a point of @xmath94 .",
    "a morphism @xmath108 consists of a morphism @xmath109 in @xmath61 , that takes @xmath110 to @xmath49 via the functoriality of @xmath94 .",
    "this is a topological category , in which the space of objects is topologized as the disjoint union of spaces of the form @xmath94 , and the space of morphisms also has a topology ( topological categories are reviewed in section  [ s : categoriesandlimits ] ) .",
    "inside this category we have a subcategory that we will denote by @xmath111 it is the full subcategory of @xmath105 consisting of objects @xmath106 where @xmath112 .",
    "next , we would like to define a contravariant functor @xmath113 recall that we have a map @xmath35 at the background , coming from the chosen basepoint in @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "one can think of @xmath36 as an immersion or even an embedding if one wishes , but this does not matter for the construction we want to make now .",
    "let @xmath106 be an object of @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the mapping cylinder of the surjection representing @xmath38 .",
    "there is a natural inclusion @xmath115 which induces a map @xmath116 .",
    "notice that @xmath117 defines a point in @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the space defined by means of a pullback square @xmath120 notice that if , for example , @xmath1 is connected then there is an equivalence @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the ordinary loop space of @xmath1 ( for some choice of basepoint ) .",
    "this is because the quotient @xmath123 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of @xmath53 circles .",
    "finally , define the functor @xmath124 on objects of @xmath125 by the formula @xmath126 since our source category is a topological category , this spectrum really should be thought of as a fiber in a `` homotopy bundle of spectra '' over @xmath94 ( the notion of a homotopy bundle of spectra is reviewed in section  [ s : fiberwise ] ) .",
    "the contravariant functoriality of @xmath124 is determined by the fact that @xmath80 is a covariant functor on @xmath61 , and by the observation that a morphism @xmath127 in @xmath61 , together with a choice of @xmath128 determines a map ( which is , incidentally , a homotopy equivalence ) @xmath129    let @xmath130 be the fiber of the map @xmath131 during the introduction , we will some times abbreviate this as @xmath132 .",
    "the notation is meant to suggest a space ( more precisely , a spectrum ) of `` twisted natural transformations '' .",
    "@xmath94 is a contravariant functor on @xmath61 .",
    "the construction @xmath133 also tries to be a contravariant from @xmath61 to @xmath134 , but it also is a bundle over @xmath94 .",
    "in this situation , one can define a space ( or spectrum ) of twisted natural transformations , analogous to the usual space of natural transformations , where mapping spaces are replaced with spaces of sections of bundles of spaces ( or , as it is happens in our case , bundles of spectra ) .",
    "the relevant definitions are given in sections  [ s : fiberwise ] , [ s : categoriesandlimits ] , and especially [ s : twistednat ] .",
    "moreover , the notation is supposed to remind us that we only are looking at natural transformations whose restriction to @xmath101 is trivial .",
    "we are finally ready to state our main result .",
    "[ t : maintheorem ] suppose that @xmath0 is tame , and @xmath1 is a tame stably parallelizable manifold .",
    "there is a natural weak equivalence between @xmath135 and @xmath136    [ r : parallelizabily unnecessary ] we believe that the theorem holds almost as stated without the assumption that @xmath1 is stably parallelizable , except that in place of the smash product with @xmath137 one would have a thom space of a certain evident bundle .",
    "however , our proof of the theorem relies on a description of the taylor polynomial ( as opposed to just the homogeneous layer ) of the functor @xmath138 , and we do not know how to describe the taylor polynomials without an assumption of parallelizability .    the spectrum of natural transformations that appears in the statement of the main theorem can be described as the spectrum of restricted sections of a certain homotopy bundle of spectra over the coend @xmath139 note that this coend is a pair of spaces .",
    "`` restricted '' means that we are only looking at sections that are trivial on the subspace part of the pair . to put it a little differently",
    ": we are thinking of the bundle of spectra , whose generic fiber is @xmath140 , as defining a kind of twisted cohomology theory on the category of ( pairs of ) spaces over @xmath141 , and we are taking the relative cohomology of the pair given by the coend above .",
    "[ r : alternative ] an alternative way to think of the space @xmath142 is as the space of rooted forests whose underlying partition is @xmath38 .",
    "it follows that @xmath141 can be thought of as the space of rooted forests , whose leaves are marked by points of @xmath0 , and whose underlying partition has excess @xmath5 . in figure",
    "[ fig : twoforests ] , we try to illustrate this space of forests in the case @xmath143 , together with the fundamental homotopy bundle over it .    : above , we have two points in @xmath144 - the space of forests of excess @xmath145 with leaves marked by points in @xmath0 , and underneath each one of them , a point in the corresponding fiber @xmath146 .",
    "the vectors @xmath147 represent the part having to do with @xmath148 .",
    "the reason this part is there is that our space is really the thom space of a pullback of the normal bundle of @xmath149 in @xmath150 . in this picture , a normal vector to the diagonal @xmath1 in @xmath151 is represented by an @xmath152-tuple of tangent vectors that add up to zero . ]    this viewpoint will be developed further in the second part of the series  @xcite , where we will give an analogous description of the derivatives of @xmath2 as the twisted cohomology of a certain space of connected _ graphs _ ( as opposed to forests ) with points marked by elements of @xmath0 .",
    "it may not be immediately obvious that what we have described in theorem  [ t : maintheorem ] is a homogeneous functor of @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that , first , @xmath140 is a homogeneous functor of degree @xmath53 , and the spectrum described in theorem  [ t : maintheorem ] is a compact homotopy limit of such functors . to make this more explicit",
    ", we will observe ( remark  [ r : structureofe_n ] ) that the category @xmath61 admits a nice filtration by certain sub - categories @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath153 is the category of partitions of excess @xmath5 and support of size @xmath155 .",
    "accordingly , the category @xmath125 can be filtered by sub - categories @xmath156 . obviously , there is a tower of restriction maps @xmath157    [ p : embeddingoforthogonal ] the homotopy fiber of the map @xmath158 is equivalent to the product @xmath159 } \\gamma\\left((m^{n+i},\\delta^{n+i } m);{\\operatorname{map}}_*\\left(t_\\lambda,\\sigma^\\infty \\omega^\\lambda_{h\\alpha } n_+\\wedge s^{d{\\operatorname{e}}(\\lambda)}\\right)\\right)^{\\sigma_{\\lambda}}.\\ ] ] here the product is indexed by isomorphism types of objects of @xmath160 , i.e. , isomorphism types of irreducible partitions of excess @xmath5 and support of size @xmath161 .",

    "@xmath168 is the group of automorphisms of @xmath38 .",

    "thus the above homotopy limit can be written as @xmath1153 recall that @xmath1154 if @xmath1155 .",
    "in particular , if the morphism @xmath1156 is not a strict fusion , then @xmath1157 , and @xmath1154 .",
    "to say that the morphism @xmath1156 is not a strict fusion is equivalent to saying that @xmath1158 .",
    "therefore , the above spectrum of twisted natural transformations can be written in the following form @xmath1159 let us analyze @xmath1160 .",
    "recall that @xmath1161 is a category with an initial object ( namely @xmath38 ) , and @xmath459 is the contravariant functor whose value is @xmath1131 on the initial object , and is @xmath1108 on all other objects .",
    "recall that @xmath1162 it follows that there are natural equivalences , where the last one relies on lemma  [ l : alternativefort ] @xmath1163 in conclusion , we have obtained the following proposition , which is the main result of this section .",
    "[ p : mainthmforstandard ] let @xmath0 be a disjoint union of balls in @xmath257 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a nice open submanifold of @xmath257 .",
    "assuming that the balls making up @xmath0 are small enough , there is a chain of weak equivalences , natural both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , connecting @xmath1164 and @xmath1165",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ t : maintheorem ] .",
    "proposition  [ p : mainthmforstandard ] essentially gives the theorem in the special case when @xmath0 is a disjoint union of standard balls .",
    "it remains to deduce the theorem for general manifolds @xmath0 , using the ideas of embedding calculus  @xcite . but",
    "first , we need to analyze our main construction a little further .",
    "in particular , we want to prove proposition  [ p : embeddingoforthogonal ] from the introduction .",
    "let @xmath38 be an object of @xmath160 for some @xmath5 and @xmath152 .",
    "thus @xmath38 is an irreducible partition of excess @xmath5 , and support of size @xmath161 .",
    "our task is to analyze the pushout of the diagram @xmath1167 and the natural map from this pushout to @xmath94 . identifying @xmath94 with @xmath164",
    ", we claim that the above pushout maps homeomorphically onto @xmath167 ( the full fat diagonal ) .",
    "we leave the proof of this claim as an easy exercise for the reader .",
    "it follows that the map from the pushout to @xmath94 is a cofibration .",
    "clearly , the group of automorphisms of @xmath38 , being a subgroup of the symmetric group @xmath176 , acts freely on the quotient of @xmath164 by the full fat diagonal .",
    "this is what we needed to check .",
    "proposition  [ p : embeddingoforthogonal ] now follows from lemma  [ l : essentiallycofibrant ] together with corollary  [ c : inductivemodel ] and induction .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction ( remark  [ r : consequences ] ) it follows from proposition  [ p : embeddingoforthogonal ] that our model for @xmath172 is a homogeneous functor of degree @xmath5 in the variable @xmath1 , and also is a polynomial functor for degree @xmath173 in the variable @xmath0 ( in the sense of embedding calculus ) .",
    "now , the proof of the main theorem . to begin with",
    ", it is enough to prove the theorem in the case when @xmath1 is a nice submanifold of some euclidean space @xmath257 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath1 is a tame stably parallelizable manifold , then for some euclidean space @xmath1168 @xmath274 is a nice submanifold of some @xmath257 , so we would know that the theorem is true for @xmath274 .",
    "but it follows from the classification of homogeneous functors that the value of a homogeneous functor at @xmath1169 is determined by its value at @xmath1168 , for any euclidean space @xmath1168 .",
    "so , let us assume that @xmath1 is a nice codimension zero submanifold of @xmath257 .",
    "we may also assume that the basepoint map @xmath35 that is used to define @xmath2 is a codimension zero embedding as well .",
    "this is so because every immersion becomes isotopic to an embedding after crossing the target with a large enough euclidean space ( and so we may assume that @xmath36 is an embedding ) , and because @xmath2 does not change its homotopy type if @xmath0 is replaced with a tubular neighborhood .",
    "let @xmath1170 be the poset / category whose objects are subsets of @xmath0 that are disjoint unions of standard balls in @xmath0 ( this is well - defined , because @xmath0 has been identified with an open subset of @xmath257 ) .",
    "let @xmath1171 be the sub - poset consisting of sets that are the disjoint union of at most @xmath231 balls .",
    "we will often want to only consider unions of balls whose radius is smaller than a fixed @xmath265 , but we will not make @xmath878 visible in the notation . for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define @xmath1172 ( the @xmath231-th taylor approximation of @xmath255 in the sense of embedding calculus ) by the formula @xmath1173 this definition differs from weiss original definition in  @xcite in that he uses the category @xmath1174 of all subsets of @xmath0 that are homeomorphic to a disjoint union of open balls , rather than the smaller category of subsets that are actually the union of standard balls , but it is not hard to show that the restriction map from weiss definition to our definition is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "next , we may replace @xmath1175 with @xmath1176 , because there is a bi - natural homotopy equivalence @xmath1177 .",
    "thus , we may take our model for @xmath1172 to be the homotopy limit @xmath1178 it is not hard to show that the above homotopy limit can be used to provide a good model for @xmath172 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath231 large enough ( in fact , @xmath231 needs to be roughly @xmath173 ) , there is a natural equivalence ( @xcite , proposition 10.9 ) @xmath1179 by proposition  [ p : mainthmforstandard ] , the right and side is equivalent to @xmath1180 by definition , this is is the same as @xmath1181 clearly , this is equivalent to @xmath1182 for @xmath1183 , because the latter is a functor of degree @xmath173 in the variable @xmath0 .",
