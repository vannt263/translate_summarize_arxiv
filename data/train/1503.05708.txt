    "<S> more interestingly however , the decay at intermediate distances , in the range @xmath70 , is much slower , attesting to the stronger coupling of the qubit to the josephson elements in its closer neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to see that the existence of these long - range spatial correlations are intimately connected to the strong entanglement between the qubit and its environment . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a full polarization of the qubit into the up state , even dressed by its cloud of oscillators , leads to short range correlations that do not extend beyond the second site of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the long - range correlations of the josephson - kondo cloud also reveal the non - linearity of the josephson element coupling site @xmath20 and site @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> a purely harmonic chain ( see supplementary material  @xcite ) leads to much faster decaying correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson - kondo cloud is therefore an experimentally accessible hallmark of the strong coupling between a two - level system and its macroscopic environment .    </S>",
    "<S> _ regime of large fine structure constant . </S>",
    "<S> _ for circuit impedances close to the quantum value @xmath71 , the matter - light interaction parameter @xmath34 becomes of order one , and the wavefunction  ( [ silbey ] ) is in principle not sufficient . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown recently  @xcite that the non - trivial many - body ground state at large dissipation can be captured by a systematic expansion in terms of coherent states , that simply generalizes the previous ansatz to a superposition of @xmath72 coherent states @xmath73 where each @xmath74 is a coherent state of the form ( [ silbey ] ) with variationally determined amplitudes @xmath75 and displacements @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath72 is increased , @xmath77 rapidly converges to the exact ground state . </S>",
    "<S> our technique , based on the exact many - body state , provides a powerful alternative to the usual numerical renormalization group calculations of the kondo cloud  @xcite , which in contrast , requires a distinct computation for each spatial distance considered . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting correlation function @xmath44 for increasing values of the dissipation strength @xmath34 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figlargealpha ] .    . </S>",
    "<S> fully converged curves ( solid lines ) were obtained with @xmath78 coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> the curves were obtained at the following values of the kondo energy : @xmath79 at @xmath80 , @xmath81 at @xmath82 and @xmath83 at @xmath84 . in each instance </S>",
    "<S> this roughly corresponds to @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath78 results are compared to the @xmath86 lineshape ( [ scaling ] ) , at the same kondo scale . </S>",
    "<S> lines a @xmath87 and b @xmath88 are there to guide the eye . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the cloud polarization @xmath44 still decays quadratically @xmath89 at the largest distances , but with a kondo energy @xmath68 that is renormalized downwards from the value predicted by ( [ silbeydelta ] ) ( our data at @xmath84 shows a renormalization of @xmath68 by a factor @xmath90 ) . at @xmath91 , a broad cross - over is visible . in the intermediate distance </S>",
    "<S> universal regime , i.e. @xmath92 , the correlation function @xmath44 decays slower than @xmath93 . at strong dissipation ( large @xmath34 ) </S>",
    "<S> , our results are consistent with the perturbative prediction @xmath94 $ ] , but for the realistic system size considered , it is difficult to achieve the extreme separation of scales between @xmath53 and @xmath67 that is required to identify this lineshape unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the converged results with @xmath78 coherent states to the analytical @xmath86 result ( [ scaling ] ) , but with the true kondo scale @xmath68 , rather than the @xmath86 estimate ( [ silbeydelta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is very interesting that , as the dissipation strength increases , a noticeable difference develops at intermediate distances between the line shapes predicted by the simple @xmath95 approximation and the fully converged @xmath96 result . </S>",
    "<S> these differences originate from subtle entanglement within the states in the bath  @xcite . indeed , contrary to the simple ansatz  ( [ silbey ] ) that is based on a single ( multi - mode ) coherent state , the environmental wavefunction in the multiple coherent state expansion can not be factorized .    despite the quantitative differences in the intermediate distance universal regime , </S>",
    "<S> it is very surprising how accurate the simple ansatz  ( [ silbey ] ) turns out to be , highlighting the unexpected simplicity of the many - body ground state of such a complicated and widely investigated hamiltonian as the spin - boson model  ( [ sbhamiltonian ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that strongly interacting quantum problems display a hidden structure that is more generic than the specific model studied in this letter , since fermionic impurity problems should show similar properties . with the rapid advances in circuit qed architecture , </S>",
    "<S> we believe that future experiments following our proposal to probe the josephson - kondo cloud will be able to reveal the simple correlations that are at the heart of these many - body states .    stimulating discussions with olivier buisson , benedikt lechtenberg and nicolas roch </S>",
