    "millimetre - wave  ( mm - wave ) communication is an important ingredient in the fifth generation cellular networks  ( 5 g )  @xcite due to the large contiguous available bandwidth in the 30 - 300 ghz spectrum , and has already attracted much research attention  @xcite . due to the high free - space pathloss at mm - wave frequencies",
    ", it is well understood that beamforming facilitated by a large number of antennas at base stations ( bss ) and/or user equipments ( ues ) is essential to achieve reasonable coverage range and high spectrum efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the reliance on high - gain beamforming at the data transmission phase , however , has posed challenges in the design of initial access for mm - wave systems , as conventional designs for micro - wave ( e.g. , below 6  ghz ) cellular systems may not work for mm - wave systems  @xcite .    in the initial access of existing cellular systems ( such as the long term evolution ( lte ) ) ,",
    "bss periodically broadcast reference signals  ( rss ) in synchronisation channels and ues detect the presence of the rs and determine the correct frame timer of the bs . due to the favourable propagation characteristics in the sub-6 ghz bands , the rs in lte",
    "is transmitted omnidirectionally from the bss  @xcite without sophisticated beamforming .",
    "such a transmission strategy , if adopted in mm - wave systems , could lead to a much smaller discoverable range than the intended coverage range  @xcite .",
    "in other words , a ue that can achieve a reasonably high data - rate when high - gain beamforming is employed may not be able to discover and synchronise to the bs .",
    "in this case , communication link establishment fails at the first step and initial access will then be the bottleneck of a mm - wave cellular system .",
    "the initial access for mm - wave cellular has been considered by  @xcite . amongst them , reference  @xcite proposed a hybrid design that uses microwave band for initial access ( bs discovery and synchronisation ) and mm - wave band for subsequent beam alignment and data transmission . while this approach could provide macro - level discoverable range , one disadvantage is the increased hardware complexity due to the need for two radios ( see sec .",
    "iv.b and table - i of  @xcite ) .",
    "references  @xcite instead focused on mm - wave standalone design and investigated the role of beamforming in mm - wave bs discovery .",
    "abu - surra .",
    "_ et al . _ in  @xcite numerically showed that a certain received signal to noise ratio  ( snr ) of the rss is required to guarantee a targeted probability of bs discovery .",
    "they then developed a beam - broadening technique to accommodate appropriate beamforming transmissions to attain the required snr .",
    "later , desai .",
    "_ et al . _ in  @xcite proposed a hierarchical search strategy aided by the beamforming design from  @xcite to improve the snr of the received rss .",
    "if the transmission time for each beamformed rs is fixed , a narrower beam would provide higher received snr and thus allow a beamformed ue to accumulate more energy for bs detection purpose , yielding a better bs discovery performance .",
    "however , when beamforming is adopted , spatial scanning is inevitable to ensure reasonable discoverable range to ues in all directions . consider multiple beams ( with each pointing at a different direction ) are multiplexed in time to scan the space and the time overhead incurred by spatial scanning is fixed .",
    "if narrower beams are deployed , higher beamforming gain can be achieved in each beamformed direction ; but on the other hand , since more beams are required to cover all the directions of interest , a smaller fraction of time is made available to each beam .",
    "it hence remains unclear how the collected rs energy at ues , and the performance of bs discovery , is affected by employing different beamforming strategies and different gain - time allocations . in this sense , it is natural to ask : what is the optimal rs transmission scheme that provides the best bs discovery performance for ues within a targeted discoverable region ?",
    "the recent work in  @xcite has compared omnidirectional ( without beamforming ) transmission with directional transmission of rss via random beamformers .",
    "they derived generalised likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) detectors for bs discovery by assuming a rank - one ( single - path ) channel ( see sec .",
    "iii of  @xcite ) and numerically evaluated the detection performance under both single - path and multi - path channel models .",
    "the results therein demonstrated that omnidirectional transmission outperforms directional transmission with random angular scanning .",
    "however , they did not consider more sophisticated rs transmission strategies such as sequential scanning with optimised beamformers to transmit of rss .    in this paper , we propose a sequential beamforming strategy and develop a few fundamental limits on the performance of bs discovery .",
    "the analytical results in turn shed light on practical designs .",
    "our contributions are three - fold stated as follows .    first , for the rs transmission strategy considered , we derive a glrt detector for bs discovery that does not rely on a rank - one channel assumption .",
    "we explicitly characterise the statistical properties of the glrt detector , from which we establish the relationship between the performance of mm - wave bs discovery and key system design parameters , including the rs sequence length and the time used for bs discovery at the ues .",
    "these results provide useful guidance on proper choices of relevant parameters in practical system designs .",
    "second , by the method of large deviations  @xcite , we show that it is the average beamforming gain that determines the asymptotic behaviour of the miss - discovery probability when searching time at ues is large .",
    "we then identify desirable patterns of the average beamforming gain that minimises the average miss - discovery probability of ues in an intended discoverable region .",
    "third , we propose a sequential beamforming strategy that uses a pre - designed beamforming codebook for rs transmission .",
    "this approach allows flexible choices between narrow and wide beams in constructing the codebook so as to better approximate the desirable patterns .",
    "the approach is shown to be beneficial when bs beamforming is constrained by per - antenna power limits .",
    "for practical choices of ue searching time , numerical results show that our proposed beamforming strategy provides orders of magnitude improvement compared to random beamformers .",

    "however , this comes at the expense of sacrificing the beamforming gain in other directions , leading to poorer bs discovery performance in those directions .",
    "clearly , if universal coverage for all directions is enforced , spatial scanning using narrow beams may not help to improve @xmath140 as the total available time , @xmath141 , is allocated to a larger number of beams , each covering a different angular interval .",
    "we show next that a good choice is to design rs transmit beamformers such that @xmath142 for ues at all directions are equalised . in the next section ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we develop an analytical framework for the initial access ( a.k.a . base station ( bs ) discovery ) in a millimeter - wave ( mm - wave ) communication system and propose an effective strategy for transmitting the reference signals ( rss ) used for bs discovery . specifically , by formulating the problem of bs discovery at user equipments ( ues ) as hypothesis tests , we derive a detector based on the generalised likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) and characterise the statistical behaviour of the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results obtained allow analysis of the impact of key system parameters on the performance of bs discovery , and show that rs transmission with narrow beams may not be helpful in improving the overall bs discovery performance due to the cost of spatial scanning . using the method of large deviations , we identify the desirable beam pattern that minimises the average miss - discovery probability of ues within a targeted detectable region . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose to transmit the rs with sequential scanning , using a pre - designed codebook with narrow and/or wide beams to approximate the desirable patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed design allows flexible choices of the codebook sizes and the associated beam widths to better approximate the desirable patterns . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method . </S>"
