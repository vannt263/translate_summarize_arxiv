    "since the original suggestion by weinberg @xcite that the nuclear forces could be understood within the framework of effective field theories ( eft ) there has been an increasing interest in the subject ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "a key ingredient of the eft formalism is that the cut - off dependence which is introduced in order to smooth out ultraviolet ( uv ) singularities can be absorbed by suitable counterterms , and hence any dependence on physical scales much higher than the ones of the problem at hand can be encoded in a few ( unknown ) constants . in order to achieve this in a systematic manner",
    "counting rules are also necessary .",
    "weinberg s suggestion consisted of two steps .",
    "the first one was calculating the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials order by order in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath1pt ) from the heavy baryon chiral lagrangian ( hb@xmath1l ) @xcite .",
    "the second one introducing the potentials thus obtained in a lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation .",
    "there is no doubt that the first step can be carried out within an eft framework : the renormalized nn potentials are known at leading , nl and nnl order @xcite , with even higher order corrections @xcite and isospin breaking terms @xcite taken care of .",
    "the second step however is delicate .",
    "the potentials obtained in the first step are increasingly singular at short distances as we rise the order of @xmath1pt they are calculated .",
    "hence the introduction of a regulator in the ls equation is compulsory .",
    "since , even with the leading order ( lo ) potential , the ls equation can only be solved numerically , it is not clear that the scattering amplitude thus obtained is cut - off independent .",
    "this is so even for the successful fits @xcite to different partial amplitudes , where the cut - off is regarded as a variational parameter close to the last scale integrated out .",
    "we present here a proof that this cut - off can be removed from the lo ( in the @xmath1pt counting ) nn interaction if we tune properly the coupling constants of the potential .",
    "however , for this to be so we also have to tune the coupling constant of a non - local potential in the triplet channel . even then , the only solution we find turns out to be physically unacceptable . nevertheless , the insight on scaling so gained enables us to put forward a new proposal of counting rules where , coming back to standard procedures , divergences are fully absorbed by local counterterms .",
    "as efts have been mainly used in a perturbative framework , it is far from obvious how the two main features of those , namely renormalizability and counting rules , must be implemented in a non - perturbative one .",
    "although in this work we shall primarily address the question of renormalizability , we would like to start by making a remark on counting rules , which emanates from previous experience on eft in non - perturbative systems . it was pointed out in ref . @xcite",
    "that calculating the potential in a non - relativistic system can be understood as the integration of certain degrees of freedom , which can be implemented as a matching calculation between two efts . in our case",
    "the higher energy eft is the hb@xmath1l for the two nucleon sector , which is a local theory with pions and non - relativistic nucleons as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "this eft has an energy ( @xmath2 ) cut - off ( @xmath3 ) such that @xmath4 and a momentum ( @xmath5 ) cut - off ( @xmath6 ) such that @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the pion and nucleon mass respectively , and @xmath10 for the scale of non - goldstone boson qcd states ) .",
    "its lagrangian can be organized according to the chiral counting since chiral symmetry ( and its breaking ) are explicit .",
    "the lower energy eft has an energy cut - off ( @xmath11 ) such that @xmath12 and a momentum cut - off such that @xmath13 .",
    "it consists of non - relativistic nucleons interacting through a ( non - local ) potential .",
    "the potential plays the role of a matching coefficient . as such , the potential encodes information on the higher energy eft and it can be calculated _ independently _ on how the calculation of the lower energy eft is organized , namely _ independently _ on what the counting in the low energy eft is .",
    "hence , on the one hand , the potential can be calculated order by order in @xmath1pt . on the other hand ,",
    "chiral symmetry is not explicit anymore in the lower energy eft ( no pion fields exist ) and consequently the chiral counting is not the natural way to organize the calculation anymore .",
    "an interesting example of a related situation is the pionium system ( see @xcite for a recent account ) , which has been studied using a series of efts @xcite .",
    "the higher energy eft is the chiral lagrangian coupled to electromagnetism and the lower energy one a quantum mechanical hamiltonian with the coulomb potential and local interactions .",
    "the matching between the two efts can be carried out perturbatively in @xmath1pt and @xmath14 , but the calculations in the lower eft are carried out keeping the coulomb potential non - perturbatively ( otherwise no bound state exists ) and , furthermore , one does not need to specify to which order of @xmath1pt the local potentials have been calculated .    following that spirit , the main question for the nn system is what should be treated as the lo potential in the low energy calculations . in the ( higher energy )",
    "@xmath1pt counting the lo potential consists of the one pion exchange term ( ope ) plus two local ( @xmath0-function ) terms .",
    "this assumes that the natural scale of the two local terms is of the order of the last scale integrated out ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "if the nn system was in a perturbative regime the scale of these two local terms would provide the scale of the scattering lengths .",
    "since the experimental scattering lengths are much larger than the ones predicted in this way , we can foresee at least two possibilities .",
    "the first one is that an unsuspected behavior of qcd at energies @xmath16 produces unnaturally large values for the local potentials",
    ". then one may consider these local terms as the ( low energy ) lo potential and treat the ope ( and higher orders ) perturbatively @xcite .",
    "this approach has been worked out at @xmath17 @xcite showing slow - convergence in the @xmath18 channel and no convergence at all in the @xmath19-@xmath20 channel .",
    "the second possibility is that the local terms do have natural sizes but the low - energy dynamics is responsible for the large scattering lengths . in this case",
    "there is no reason to treat the ope perturbatively and a fully non - perturbative evaluation of the ls equation with lo potential ( in the @xmath1pt counting ) is required @xcite .",
    "we shall stick to this second possibility for most of the paper , although eventually a third possibility , which is half way , will emerge as the most reasonable one ( to us ) .    before going on ,",
    "let us briefly discuss some previous work on the renormalization of the ls equation .",
    "the case of a local ( and hence separable ) potential , namely consisting of delta functions and its derivatives , has received plenty of attention@xcite .",
    "this was expected to mimic the very low - energy ( @xmath21 ) behavior of nn scattering .",
    "the regularization of this pure local eft was a matter of debate some time ago : a cut - off regularization showed a systematic order by order improvement in the phase shift fit whereas dimensional regularization ( dr ) with ms scheme was extremely sensible to the large scattering length and shallow ( nearly)-bound state , which translated into a poor radius of convergence .",
    "the shortcomings of dr with ms were cured using the pds scheme @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the final outcome appears to be equivalent to the well - known effective range expansion @xcite .",
    "the next step in difficulty is renormalizing the lo potential in the @xmath18 channel , which contains a non - separable piece from the ope .",
    "it was first carried out in @xcite , and reproduced by several authors ( see @xcite , for a recent report ) .",
    "we shall re - obtain these results in section 3 . finally , as for renormalization in the @xmath19-@xmath20 channel , the available literature is , on the contrary , somewhat scarce @xcite and the results are , to our understanding , not fully satisfactory ( see sec",
    "the main difference of our approach with respect to the previous ones is that , in addition to the bare constants associated to local terms in the potential , we will also allow , but only in a initial stage , the bare constants of the non - local potentials to have non - trivial flows .",
    "this is less restrictive than the standard assumption that only local terms should renormalize the ls equation @xcite for nn systems , which , in any case , is contained in it .",
    "this will permit us , not only to make meaningful comparisons with related work , but also to draw restrictions on the power counting .",
    "having examined which conditions on the coupling constants are required in order to renormalize the ls equation , and the eventual consequences this has on our observables , we will be able to glean which terms of the potential can be included at lo , and which ones must be treated as perturbations , in the relevant case where only the coupling constants of local terms are allowed to flow and non - local potentials are fixed at the hb@xmath1pt values .",
    "so , once the ( low energy ) lo potential has been identified , we suspect that , in order to be renormalizable , a higher order calculation should be organized as follows . the ls equation must be solved and renormalized treating the lo potential , as well as its couplings , non - perturbatively , but the nlo potentials and higher perturbatively .",
    "therefore , the first step in this program is to identify a ( low energy ) lo potential and to prove that it is renormalizable .",
    "we start by the nave choice , namely the lo potential in the @xmath1pt counting .",
    "for the spin singlet channel the ls equation is indeed renormalizable .",
    "however , for the spin triplet channels , we find that the lo potential in the @xmath1pt counting is only renormalizable if a certain coupling constant of a non - local potential has a non - trivial flow .",
    "( or , in other words , if only the coupling constants of the local potentials are allowed to flow it is non - renormalizable . ) even in this case , the physical outcome is not satisfactory : the partial wave mixing is washed out of the renormalized amplitude .",
    "we conclude that the ( low energy ) lo potential is not the full lo potential in the @xmath1pt counting for the triplet channels .",
    "we identify a ( low energy ) lo potential , which is renormalizable , and prove that , if we treat the difference as a perturbation , it is also renormalizable at first order .",
    "we distribute the paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce a convenient basis for the nn wave functions and our notations .",
    "a brief note at the end of this section serves to close all what refers to the isosinglet - singlet channel . in section 3",
    "we prove that the isovector - singlet channel is renormalizable and provide explicit expressions for the cut - off dependence of the bare parameters both for a hard cut - off and for dimensional regularization . in section 4 we prove that the isosinglet - triplet channel is also renormalizable , but requires a strong cut - off dependence of the coupling constant of the ( non - local ) term in the potential which , in turn , prevents the renormalized amplitude from partial wave mixing .",
    "we interprete this result as an indication that this term must be treated perturbatively and prove that , if so , the first order in perturbation theory is finite . after briefly discussing in section 5",
    "the isovector - spin vector channel , section 6 is devoted to a discussion .",
    "we start from the lo nn potential given for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the pion decay constant ( @xmath24 93 mev ) .",
    "this potential acts on a wave function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nucleon isospin and spin indices respectively .",
    "this wave function can be decomposed into irreducible representations of spin and isospin as follows : @xmath28 \\ , .",
    "\\label{(2.1.1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the potential ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) reduces for each isospin - spin channel to : @xmath29    we still have to implement fermi symmetry .",
    "this implies that the irreducible wave functions ( [ ( 2.1.1 ) ] ) must fulfill ( isospin and spin indices will be omitted for the rest of this section ) : @xmath30 which is implemented in the ls equation if we choose : @xmath31    it is the advantage of the above decomposition that we will not need to specify which ( coupled ) partial waves we are analyzing .",
    "if the ls equation for the potentials ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) was well defined , using ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) would be equivalent to solving the ls equation : @xmath32 ( @xmath33=@xmath34 ) , namely ignoring the statistics and then using the standard formulas : @xmath35    however , the ls equation for @xmath36 is not well defined in any channel and hence using ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) or ( [ ( 2.6)])-([(2.7 ) ] ) may not be totally equivalent .",
    "in particular , for the ss and vv channels , the uv divergences one finds using ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) are softer than those from ( [ ( 2.6)])-([(2.7 ) ] ) , so we shall work with ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) . for the sv and vs channels , however , the uv divergences found using ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) are as strong as the ones that stem from ( [ ( 2.6)])-([(2.7 ) ] ) . for convenience",
    ", we have chosen to work with the latter for these channels .    the ls equation in the isoscalar - scalar channel in ( [ ( 2.5 ) ] ) is already well defined , as it is apparent from the anti - symmetrization of the corresponding potential ( [ ( 2.2 ) ] ) .",
    "on the contrary , the other three channels require regularization . searching for the systematics to tackle them will be the aim of the next three sections . for notation simplicity",
    ", the energy dependence of the t - matrices as well as of other auxiliary functions will not be displayed explicitely for the rest of the paper .",
    "the ls equation for this channel reads :    @xmath37    where @xmath38    where in the last lines we remember the values those constants would take if the potential had been calculated at lo in @xmath1pt .",

    "we call the term proportional to @xmath73 above spin symmetry breaking ( ssb ) term",
    ". this term breaks orbital angular momentum conservation and makes the analysis of this channel qualitatively different from the previous one . in order to illustrate it ,",
    "let us take @xmath74 for simplicity . as we regulate ( [ ( 4.1 ) ] ) , the possible divergences arising when the regulator is removed depend on the high momentum behavior of @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath76 , the usual power counting arguments imply that , due to the ssb term , the integral on the rhs will rise this power by one .",
    "hence , the high momentum behavior of the lhs of the equation will not match the one of its rhs unless : ( i ) @xmath77 and the high momentum contribution of the potential cancels out the one arising from the integral or ( ii ) @xmath78 and the bare coupling constant @xmath73 goes to zero as the cut - off goes to infinity , which removes the @xmath79 term on the rhs .",
    "we prove in the appendix a that the case ( i ) in fact reduces to ( ii ) .",
    "the preceding discussion provides a rather intuitive introduction to what , in the course of section 4.1 , we will demonstrate in full detail .",
    "that is , all those rising divergences caused by the ssb term can only be renormalized by a , so far undetermined , flowing of their accompanying coupling constant , @xmath73 .",
    "next we will fix this cut - off dependence and , having explored the consequences such a behavior has on the amplitude , will come back in section 4.2 to standard procedures . there",

    "the isoscalar scalar channel does not require regularization .",
    "for the isovector scalar channel we recover the flows of ref .",
    "the remaining two channels have deserved a more detailed study .",
    "the first non - trivial result is that the renormalization of the isoscalar vector channel requires a strong flow of the coupling constant of a non - local potential , the ssb one , or , in other words , if only the coupling constants of the local potentials are allowed to flow , the isoscalar vector channel is not renormalizable .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first of all , the flow ( [ ( 4.9 ) ] ) of the coupling constant of the ssb term is not such a big surprise .",
    "notice that at high momentum this term tends to a ( direction dependent ) constant , which is the same behavior ( except for the direction dependence ) as the @xmath0-function term both in the singlet and the triplet channel , the coupling constants of which also show similar flows .",
    "the main difference is that the leading behavior for @xmath57 is fixed and the subleading contains the free parameter ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "for @xmath73 instead , the leading behavior contains the free parameter ( @xmath102 ) and the subleading behavior is not observable .",
    "what is worse , the flow ( [ ( 4.9 ) ] ) has undesirable consequences : the renormalized t - matrix conserves orbital angular momentum , even if the bare interaction does not ( see appendix c ) . and @xmath137 up to order @xmath138 that the effective range depends on @xmath102 only through the scattering length .",
    "since the latter can be adjusted by tuning @xmath64 , up to this order both the scattering length and the effective range are blind to @xmath102 .",
    "we have not looked at what happens to the rest of the amplitude or to higher orders but we suspect that they are also insensitive to @xmath102 . ] since it is precisely the ope the main responsible for mixing ( also of higher partial waves @xcite ) , we would like it to keep doing this job for us . therefore , in order for @xmath73 not to flow , but to be fixed at the hb@xmath1l values and produce partial wave mixing , we are forced to exclude the ssb term from the ( low energy ) lo potential , and to treat it as a perturbation .",
    "this also appears to be reasonable from the phenomenological point of view since the observed mixings are small @xcite .",
    "we have developed this line in sections 4.2 and 5 .",
    "we have proved that at first order the vector channels remain renormalizable ( at zeroth order the problem reduces to the one in the singlet channels , which are renormalizable ) .",
    "the picture which emerges is half way between @xcite , where the pions are treated perturbatively , and @xcite where the whole potential is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "the ( low energy ) lo potential is the part of the lo potential in the @xmath1pt counting which conserves orbital angular momentum .",
    "we are tempted to propose the following counting .",
    "the @xmath139 ( @xmath140 contribution to the nn potential in the @xmath1pt counting must be divided into two pieces : the one which conserves orbital angular momentum ( ss ) and the one which does not ( ssb ) .",
    "the ssb terms keep their @xmath1pt counting but the ss ones are enhanced and must be counted as @xmath141 .",
    "only the lo potential @xmath142 must be treated ( and renormalized ) non - perturbatively .",
    "we have seen here that this proposal is theoretically consistent at next to leading order , and , in addition , it does not require any coupling constant of a non - local potential to flow anymore .",
    "it remains to be seen if it is still so beyond that order and , of course , whether it is phenomenologically successful .",
    "let us finally comment on recent work on the subject @xcite .",
    "the authors in both references try to renormalize the triplet channel by adjusting the coupling constant of the @xmath0-potential only . hence , according to our results both works should show a remnant cut - off dependence when the cut - off is large enough .",
    "note also that it is only in the large cut - off limit when a meaningful comparison is possible , since the regularizations used in the three works are different .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who use a subtracted ( @xmath62-dependent ) ls equation , argue that a reasonable boundary condition is that for large @xmath62 the t - matrix coincides with the potential , and check numerically whether , once the scattering lengths are fixed , the remaining observables are independent of @xmath62 for large @xmath62 .",
    "they find that for laboratory energies up to @xmath143 the @xmath144 and @xmath145 phase shifts are remarkably independent of @xmath62 for @xmath146 but the mixing angle shows a strong @xmath62-dependence for @xmath147 and only for @xmath148 the @xmath62-dependence smooths and the results may appear to converge .",
    "we interpret this stronger @xmath62-dependence of the mixing angle as an indication of the remnant cut - off dependence mentioned above .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtain the flows by analyzing the short distance behavior of the schrdinger equation ( see also @xcite ) . for the @xmath18",
    "they are in qualitative agreement with ours . for the triplet channel",
    "they present analytic flow equations which are argued to coincide with those of the chiral limit .",
    "the flow of the @xmath0-function term is given implicitly by their equation ( 18 ) .",
    "they assume that their @xmath149 , which is proportional to our @xmath73 , does not flow that appears in the singlet channel is equivalent to out @xmath137 and , accordingly , remains fixed .",
    "] and find a multi - branch structure for the flow of their @xmath150 , which is proportional to our @xmath57 ( @xmath151 , @xmath152 playing the role of an inverse cut - off ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that if they allowed @xmath149 flow like our @xmath73 in section 4.1 , namely @xmath153 , and @xmath150 like our @xmath57 , namely @xmath154 , their eq . (",
    "18 ) becomes cut - off independent .",
    "hence our flow ( 4.1.5 ) is a solution in the @xmath151 limit to the flow equation ( 18 ) of ref .",
    "recall , however , that , if @xmath149 is not allowed to flow , the strict limit @xmath151 can not be taken .",
    "this is proved in appendix d. hence eq .",
    "( 18 ) of @xcite does not produce an acceptable flow for @xmath155 and , therefore , it can not be used to properly renormalize the triplet channel .",
    "furthermore , we would like to remark that leaving the cut - off finite and checking that the finite cut - off effects are higher order in the eft expansion is a procedure which unavoidably will lead to problems in this case .",
    "if we wish to improve the accuracy of our eft calculation , we will have to calculate at higher orders .",
    "even if we insist in keeping @xmath152 finite , we will have to choose it smaller and smaller for the lo terms not to jeopardize the accuracy of the higher order calculation .",
    "then at some point @xmath152 will hit the region were no continuous solution exists and we will loose all predictive power ( if we give up continuity , an infinite number of inequivalent solutions exists ) .",
    "note that the fact that finite cut - off effects can be compensated by higher dimensional operators @xcite , which holds in perturbatively renormalizable ( and asymptotically free ) theories , needs not hold here .",

    "the relevant integral is obtained by substituting : @xmath183 in ( [ ( b.3 ) ] ) . in order to get the leading behavior in @xmath175 of this integral we can set @xmath180 in all but the substituted term above .",

    "the proof of the second formula is identical .",
    "the third formula is proved by simply noticing that all integrals involved are at most logarithmically divergent and , those which actually are , go multiplied by @xmath202 .",
    "in section 4 , when we focused on proving that a certain behavior of the bare constants of the potential as functions of the cut - off ( namely , @xmath57 , @xmath73 @xmath24 @xmath203 ) would render a finite t - matrix , only @xmath57 was conveniently fine - tuned . as a result the so - computed scattering amplitude lacked from partial wave mixing , which is expected due to the second rang tensorial term in the ( bare ) hamiltonian . in order to obtain partial wave mixing two possibilities must be regarded . on the one hand , it could well happen that , indeed , mixing should not have been considered as lo , but as a nlo term to be treated perturbatively , the divergences it may cause being absorbed in the usual way by higher order local counterterms .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the fact that partial wave mixing in this channel amounts only to a few degrees .",
    "this treatment resums the @xmath43-proportional part of ope .",
    "its ssb term , now eliminated by the strong suppression of @xmath73 , is then recovered in a nlo analysis .",

    "a proper tuning of @xmath73 to a , let s say , non - trivial rg fixed point , could very well recover mixing at the leading order .",
    "so far , the existence of such a fixed point is anything but evident . uncovering it or ruling it out requires detailed numerical work which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , in order to illustrate our point let us provide two approximations that exemplify how this tuning would emerge , how it would affect previous results and to which extent to achieve this goal we depend on the exact resolution of our actual system of integral equations .",
    "let s take in the following @xmath74 for simplicity .",
    "we will also apply the chiral limit ( @xmath8 , @xmath137 @xmath204 0 ) and work with @xmath205 and @xmath206 defined in section 4.2 .",

    "we wish to introduce some reasonable approximation that allows us to transform the non - separable in @xmath171 and @xmath212 functions @xmath213 into separable ones .",
    "once this is achieved we only need to solve a conventional system of equations and check whether , at least within this approximation , a non - trivial fixed point exists .",
    "obviously our approximation should be as compatible as possible with what we know about the behavior of the full @xmath214-integrals .",

    "unfortunately , no separable @xmath217 achieves this .",

    "we have not been able to figure out any reasonable approximation which produces a non - trivial @xmath232 .",
    "anyway , in order to illustrate the kind of fixed point we are looking for , let us take another option which , unfortunately , is completely unrealistic .",
    "it consists of sending @xmath233 and @xmath218 to zero , keeping @xmath234 as a mere constant ( @xmath235 ) . that presents the main advantage of producing decoupled equations for @xmath227 and @xmath49 : @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",

    "unfortunately , as mentioned before , the assumptions made for the @xmath217 here are not realistic .",
