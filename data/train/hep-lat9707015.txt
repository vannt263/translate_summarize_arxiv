    "* the gauge - invariant degrees of freedom of the interpolated field should be local functions of those of @xmath52 , where by local we mean within distances of @xmath53 .",
    "the reason for this is clear .",
    "if the gauge - invariant degrees of freedom of the interpolated fields were not constructed locally from the @xmath54 , the interpolation could modify the non - local properties of the correlation functions of gauge - invariant quantities and thus the physics would be interpolation - dependent .",
    "what is not so obvious is whether the gauge - dependent degrees of freedom of the interpolated field should also be constructed locally from the @xmath52 .",
    "the reason why this does not seem to be necessary is that , even if gauge - dependent degrees of freedom of @xmath55 were correlated at large distances with respect to @xmath53 owing to the interpolation , this would at most induce long - range correlations suppressed by @xmath35 in the physical sector , according to ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "we can then always choose the cutoff ratio to be as small as is necessary to ensure that these unphysical correlations are negligible ( for instance at any finite volume , we can choose the cutoff ratio small enough so that the long - range correlation , induced by the non - locality of the interpolation , between two physical fields at points @xmath56 and @xmath57 is smaller than @xmath58 ) .",
    "in general we expect that the less local the interpolation is , the smaller the cutoff ratio will have to be ; so , for practical reasons , it would be much preferable that the interpolation be as local as possible .",

    "our numerical results for @xmath0 in 2d show , however , that the non - locality of the gauge - dependent degrees of freedom of @xmath55 is mild , in the sense that the correlation length of the @xmath55 fields , averaged over random @xmath52 configurations , is finite and of @xmath53 .",

    "this theory is then a gauge theory with extra charged scalars in a non - linear realization ( @xmath48 is unitary ) .",
    "these scalars are the pure gauge transformations , which couple through the non - invariant terms in the original action .",
    "it is clear that in any successful proposal for regulating chiral gauge theories , these scalars must decouple from the light physical spectrum . in the case of a spontaneously broken gauge theory",
    "these degrees of freedom remain , since they become the longitudinal gauge bosons .",
    "the fnn conjecture is that ( [ gi ] ) flows in the ir to the same point as the theory ( [ ni ] ) with @xmath73 , provided that the strength of the interactions in @xmath74 is `` small '' .",
    "their argument is quite simple .",
    "let us suppose that the characteristic coupling of the non - invariant terms is arbitrarily small at the cutoff scale . then in the gauge - invariant picture of the theory ( [ gi ] ) , this implies that the @xmath48 fields are very weakly coupled .",
    "consequently , the free energy will be maximized when the @xmath48 variables are decorrelated at distances of the order of the cutoff ( i.e. the lattice spacing ) or , in other words , these degrees of freedom are effectively very massive .",

    "( it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ gi ] ) that if we perform the integration over @xmath48 , what remains is an exactly gauge - invariant theory due to the exact symmetry ( [ gtg ] ) . ) in this situation , the only effect of the @xmath48 fields is a renormalization of the gauge - invariant couplings in @xmath69 .    in the case",
    "we are interested in , there are also fermions",
    ". the previous reasoning would imply that the ir limit of the model ( [ pi ] ) would be equivalent to that of the original theory without a wilson term ( since this is the only term in @xmath74 ) , and thus with doubling @xcite .",
    "the reason why do not expect this to be the case in the tc formulation is that the @xmath48 integration gives an action that is expected to be local at distances of @xmath53 , but not at distances of @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that after integrating the @xmath48 fields , the effective fermion action on the @xmath1-lattice is not local .",
    "this is presumably how it can evade nn . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath48 fields decouple at distances of @xmath53 , there must exist an effective action at the @xmath2-scale that involves only the light fermionic degrees of freedom and would be local and gauge - invariant . of course , it should violate in some other way the conditions of the nn theorem .",

    "however , as we have seen , @xmath86 is not , because it is coupled to the pure gauge transformations , which are not suppressed at @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath120 is obtained from the action ( [ u1 ] ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath52 can be found in ref .",
    "alternatively , in the wilson - yukawa picture , the @xmath121 limit corresponds to setting @xmath122 in ( [ u2 ] ) and what remains is a model of fermions coupled to the scalars @xmath39 with a global @xmath123 symmetry .",
    "( in the case @xmath124 , this model is identical to the wilson - yukawa model considered in @xcite for @xmath125 ) . in this limit",
    ", the @xmath33 fields depend only on the @xmath48 .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the explicit formulae .",
    "there are two non - trivial checks to be performed in this global limit .",
    "one concerns the phase of the determinant of @xmath126 $ ] , which should vanish in this limit , up to corrections of @xmath35 according to ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "the second concerns the fermion propagator @xmath127 $ ] , which should describe two free massless undoubled fermions ( for each charged fermion in ( [ u2 ] ) ) , with the same quantum numbers under the @xmath123 global symmetry as @xmath112 and @xmath113 in ( [ u2 ] ) .    concerning the phase of the determinant , a numerical test of the expected power counting ( [ appro ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "the three histograms correspond to the phase of the fermion determinant ( @xmath128 in the background of @xmath33 configurations generated by interpolation of @xmath48 configurations generated with the measure @xmath129 in ( [ twocutwy ] ) ( i.e. randomly ) , and for three values of the cutoff ratio @xmath130 and a @xmath2-lattice size of @xmath131 .",
    "we refer to the tc lattice sizes with the notation @xmath132 .",
    "the charged - fermion content is anomaly - free : four left - handed fields with gauge charge @xmath133 and one right - handed one with charge @xmath134 .",
    "clearly the change in the phase gets smaller with the ratio @xmath4 , as expected , and this implies that the @xmath33 fields are weakly coupled in @xmath135 $ ] . as we have argued , this is important to ensure that they will decouple from the light spectrum so that an effective gauge - invariant theory with no extra scalar degrees of freedom will be obtained at large distances .",
    "to study the fermion spectrum described by the propagator @xmath127 $ ] , we are going to consider the quenched approximation . in this case",
    ", we can simplify the charged - fermion content to just one left - handed fermion with charge 1 , since the anomaly is not present in this limit .",
    "the reason why this approximation is sensible is because , as we have just seen , in the tc construction , fermion - loop corrections to the @xmath33 effective lagrangian are suppressed by powers of @xmath4 , if gauge anomalies cancel .",
    "thus , for small enough @xmath4 , the scalar measure is going to be dominated by @xmath129 in the limit of zero gauge coupling .    in the quenched approximation ,",
    "the correlation length of the @xmath33 fields only depends on the interpolation . in fig . 5",
    ", we show the scalar propagator in time : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are chosen randomly for every configuration . even though the interpolation is not strictly local , the decay at large times of @xmath139 can be fitted to an exponential .",
    "the correlation length obtained is of @xmath5 in @xmath2-units .",
    "this indicates that the scalar field decouples at large distances with respect to @xmath2 as a massive particle with a mass of the order of the boson cutoff .",
    "provided @xmath4 is small enough , this will not change when the quenched approximation is relaxed .",
    "we have computed the fermion propagators : @xmath140 where @xmath141 , the index @xmath142 refers to the neutral ( n ) ( [ neu ] ) , charged ( c ) ( [ cha ] ) or physical ( @xmath143 ) ( p ) fermion for @xmath144 , and the corresponding spatial doublers ( nd ) , ( cd ) and ( pd ) for @xmath145 . the indices @xmath146 to the different chiralities .",
    "the physical propagator corresponds to @xmath147 , while the neutral and charged ones are easily obtained from it .",
    "for every inversion , the time slice at the origin @xmath148 is chosen randomly .",
    "the number of sampled scalar configurations is typically of @xmath149@xmath150 .",
    "the matrix inversions have been performed with the conjugate - gradient method for several values of @xmath101 and fixed @xmath90 . according to the expected yukawa phase diagram in fig .",
    "3 , we should find a different spectrum for large and small @xmath101 .    at large @xmath151",
    ", we find that all the fermions are massive , as was also found in oc studies .",
    "of course this phase has no physical interest , since all the particles , scalars and fermions , have masses of the order of the cutoff .",
    "however , it is useful to understand how fermion masses are generated even if chiral symmetry is not broken .",
    "we find that the neutral propagator in momentum space is well reproduced by the hopping parameter expansion @xcite ( an expansion in @xmath152 ) . to first order in this approximation ,",
    "the neutral field is a free wilson fermion with @xmath153 @xmath154    where @xmath155 are the wave - function renormalization constants of the @xmath156 fields , respectively , and @xmath157 is the strong condensate @xmath158 justifying formula ( [ stro ] ) . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the value of this condensate for two @xmath2-lattice sizes as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath159 in fig .",
    "7 , we show two of the components of the neutral propagator @xmath160 and @xmath161 in momentum space , together with the fits to the free wilson formulae for @xmath162 in an @xmath163 lattice .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 are in good agreement with the hopping result ( [ hopeff ] ) .",
    "the neutral spatial doubler also shows good agreement with the hopping result .",
    "the charged propagator ( [ cha ] ) is also massive , as can be seen in fig .",
    "8 . however , the hopping expansion is not a good approximation in this case .",
    "our data are also consistent with the charged channel being dominated by the two - particle state @xmath108 , as was found in oc studies @xcite .    finally , for the physical field",
    ", we have @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the chirally breaking components @xmath168 are compatible with zero , as they should be if chiral symmetry is exact .    as we decrease @xmath169 , the different chiral components of both the light neutral and charged propagators start to differ .",
    "two components get lighter than the others : @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( i.e. the expected physical fields ) .",
    "there is a critical value of @xmath172 below which the two lighter components @xmath161 and @xmath173 get massless at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this is the onset of the announced chiral phase .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show the @xmath174 and @xmath175 components of the neutral ( n ) , charged ( c ) and the corresponding spatial doublers ( nd ) and ( cd ) inverse propagators in momentum space for @xmath176 .",
    "clearly there are only two components with poles at @xmath177 : @xmath170 and @xmath171 , that is the original fields in the lagrangian ( [ twocutwy ] ) .",
    "these propagators show no other poles in momentum space , as expected from undoubled fermions .",
    "none of the other components of the neutral and charged propagators , nor any of the doublers , have any pole in the whole brillouin zone .",
    "so the only massless modes are those expected .",
    "the doubler propagators @xmath178 and @xmath179 behave as massive dirac fields , supporting the expectation that the doubler modes remain in the strong phase .",
    "the dependence on @xmath101 for @xmath176 is negligible .",
    "also the volume effects for fixed @xmath4 ratio are very small @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the dependence on the ratio @xmath4 seems very important .",
    "we have found that , as this ratio increases , the splitting between the doubler and light sector decreases dramatically .",
    "this indicates the importance of the cutoff separation to ensure the doubler - light splitting .",
    "it is not clear what determines the value of @xmath172 .",
    "there is one obvious candidate , which is the boson cutoff , i.e. @xmath4 in @xmath1-lattice units .",
    "we have monitored the number of conjugate gradient iterations ( ncg ) required in the fermion matrix inversion , which is related to the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix . as @xmath101 decreases , the mass of the fermions decreases , and so does the lowest eigenvalue of the fermion matrix , so that ncg grows .",
    "however , when we enter the chiral phase , the lowest eigenvalue is the ir cutoff since there are massless fermions , so the ncg should not grow further . in fig .",
    "9 we show the ncg as a function of @xmath101 . we find a maximum where we expect @xmath172 to be ,",
    "according to the behaviour of the propagators .",
    "it is located around @xmath4 for this lattice size .",
    "the physical picture behind this expectation is nothing but the fnn conjecture that at distances larger than @xmath180 in @xmath1-units , the scalars should decouple .",
    "the correlation length of the light fermions in the strong phase is @xmath181 , so when @xmath182 the scalars decouple from the light fermions and a chiral phase appears .",
    "more statistics will be needed to understand the properties of the transition at @xmath172 . in any case",
    ", the numerical evidence in this simple model supports the expectation that the chiral phase in fig .",
    "3 exists , which has the correct light fermionic degrees of freedom to obtain a chiral gauge theory .",
    "similar conclusions are expected in 4d models .",
