    "the nomad experiment was designed to search for @xmath8 appearance from neutrino oscillations in the cern wide - band neutrino beam produced by the 450  gev proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "the detector was optimized to identify efficiently electrons from @xmath9 decays and therefore could also be used to look for @xmath1 appearance in a predominantly @xmath2 beam by detecting their charged current ( cc ) interactions @xmath10 .",
    "the main motivation for this search was the evidence for @xmath11 and @xmath0 oscillations found by the lsnd experiment  @xcite . for @xmath0 oscillations with @xmath7  ev@xmath4 and with the probability of @xmath12 observed by lsnd",
    ", a signal should be seen in the nomad data .",
    "the sensitivity of the nomad experiment to lower values of @xmath6 is limited by its @xmath13 ratio of @xmath14 0.025  km / gev , where @xmath15 is the average source to detector distance and @xmath16 is the average neutrino energy .",
    "preliminary results of the search for @xmath0 oscillations in nomad were presented earlier  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report the final results of our `` blind '' analysis .",
    "the nomad detector  @xcite consisted of a large dipole magnet delivering a field of 0.4  t and housing several subdetectors , starting with an active target composed of 132 planes of drift chambers ( dc ) of 3@xmath173  m@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the walls of the chambers provided a low average density ( 0.1 g/@xmath18 ) target with a mass of 2.7 tons .",
    "the density of the chambers was low enough to allow an accurate measurement of the momenta of the charged particles produced in the neutrino interactions .",
    "the chambers were followed by nine transition radiation ( trd ) modules  @xcite each consisting of a polypropylene radiator and a plane of straw tubes operated with an 80% xenon and 20% methane gas mixture .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) consisting of 875 lead glass blocks  @xcite provided a measurement of the energies of electrons and photons with a resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the ecal was preceded by a lead - proportional tube preshower for better photon localization . a hadron calorimeter ( hcal )",
    "was located just beyond the magnet coil and was followed by two muon stations consisting of large area drift chambers , the first station located after 8 , and the second one after 13 interaction lengths of iron .",
    "two planes of scintillator counters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , were placed before and after the trd modules .",
    "a third scintillator plane , @xmath22 , placed upstream of the magnet , was used to veto interactions caused by incoming charged particles .",
    "the trigger  @xcite used in this analysis was @xmath23 .",
    "the cern west area neutrino facility ( wanf ) neutrino beam  @xcite was produced by impinging 450 gev protons extracted from the sps onto a target consisting of beryllium rods adding up to a total thickness of 110  cm .",
    "the secondary particles emerging from the target were focused into a near parallel beam by two magnetic lenses ( the horn and the reflector ) providing toroidal magnetic fields . when running in neutrino mode positively charged particles were focused . when running in the antineutrino mode the polarity of the two lenses",
    "was reversed thus focusing negatively charged particles .",
    "the focused particles then traversed a 290  m long decay tunnel followed by an iron and earth shield .",
    "neutrinos originating from the decay of these particles travelled on average a distance of 625  m before reaching the nomad detector .",
    "since the oscillation search implies a direct comparison between the measured and expected ratios of the number of @xmath1  cc to @xmath2  cc interactions , an accurate prediction of the neutrino fluxes and spectra is crucial .",
    "they are computed with a detailed monte carlo simulation of the neutrino beam , referred to as nubeam and described in ref .",
    "this is implemented in three steps .",
    "first , the yields of the secondary particles from the interactions of 450 gev protons with the be target are calculated with the 2000 version of fluka  @xcite , a generator of hadronic interactions .",
    "these yields are then modified in order to agree with all measurements currently available in the relevant energy and angular range , namely the spy / na56  @xcite and na20  @xcite results .",
    "finally , the propagation of the secondary particles is described by a simulation program based on geant3  @xcite , which includes an accurate description of the magnetic field in the horn and reflector , and the modelling of reinteractions in the beam elements .     and @xmath1 energy spectra at nomad , within a transverse fiducial area of @xmath24  cm@xmath4 , as predicted by the nomad simulation of the neutrino beam line . ]     and @xmath1 energy spectra at nomad , within a transverse fiducial area of @xmath24  cm@xmath4 , as predicted by the nomad simulation of the neutrino beam line . ]    the resulting energy spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and of their components , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutcomp ] .",
    "the @xmath2 flux is predominantly due to decays of @xmath26 up to 60 gev neutrino energy and to those of @xmath27 beyond this energy .",
    "the bulk of the @xmath1 flux comes from the decays of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 contributing at the level of about 18% and @xmath29 at the level of about 14% .",
    "the composition of the beam is shown in table  [ tab : flav - cont ] .",

    "nomad collected data from 1995 to 1998 .",
    "most of the running , a total exposure of @xmath30 protons on target ( pot ) , was in neutrino mode and yielded @xmath31 @xmath32 interactions in the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "some data , amounting to @xmath33 pot , were also collected in antineutrino mode and some , @xmath34 pot , in zero - focusing mode ( with the horn and reflector switched off ) ; these data were used mostly to check the beam simulation .",
    "the trajectories of charged particles are reconstructed from the hits in the drift chambers and , from these trajectories , momenta are computed using the kalman filter technique  @xcite , which accounts for energy loss along the trajectory . as a first step",
    "the energy loss model used is that for pions , resulting in a momentum estimate , @xmath35 , at the beginning of the track .",
    "particles later identified as electrons or positrons are refitted  @xcite with an additional average energy loss due to bremsstrahlung , resulting in a new estimate , @xmath36 , of the momentum .",
    "energy clusters in the ecal not associated to charged particles are assumed to be due to photons .",
    "vertices are reconstructed from the trajectories of charged particles .",
    "the energy of the incident neutrino , @xmath37 , is approximated by the total ( visible ) energy of an event computed from the sum of the energies of all observed primary particles and of photons .",
    "the reconstruction efficiency for the hadronic jet was found to be overestimated by the monte carlo .",
    "this was due mostly to reconstruction effects such as the density cut described in section  [ sec : evsel ] , as well as an inadequate treatment of nuclear reinteractions ( the interactions of produced particles inside the nucleus in which the neutrino interaction occurred ) and a harder fragmentation in the monte carlo than observed in the data .",
    "the resulting overestimate of the scale of the hadronic energy , @xmath38 , could be studied by noting that the differential cross section for charged current neutrino interactions is almost independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this entails that the distribution of @xmath40 , the ratio of the average neutrino energy in the data to the average neutrino energy in the monte carlo , will be independent of @xmath41 if @xmath38 is correctly measured .",
    "however , if the measured @xmath38 is systematically reduced by an amount @xmath42 with respect to the true value of @xmath38 , then the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath41 can be described by a straight line with slope ( @xmath43 ) for small values of @xmath42 .",
    "fitting the @xmath40 distribution as a function of @xmath41 allowed us to determine that the correction to @xmath38 is @xmath44% .",
    "since the electron radiates bremsstrahlung photons in traversing the drift chambers , in order to have an accurate measure of its energy , these photons must be identified and their energy added to the energy of the ecal cluster at the end of the electron trajectory . because of the curvature of the electron trajectory in the magnetic field these photons are located in a vertical fan delimited , on the one hand , by the actual trajectory of the electron between the event vertex and the point of impact of the electron on the ecal and , on the other hand , by the extrapolation of the initial direction of the electron to the ecal .",
    "the energy of photons in the ecal and of photon conversions in the dc found in this region is included , resulting in a measure of the electron energy , @xmath45 , with an average resolution of 2.1% .",
    "the @xmath0 oscillation signal should manifest itself as an excess in the number of @xmath46 events over that expected for an intrinsic @xmath1 contamination in the beam ( about 1% of @xmath2 ) . in order to reduce systematic uncertainties associated with absolute flux predictions and selection efficiencies",
    ", we study the ratio @xmath47 of the number of @xmath1 to @xmath2 charged current interactions . due to different energy and radial distributions of incident electron and muon neutrinos ,",
    "the contribution of the intrinsic @xmath1 component is smaller at low @xmath1 energies , @xmath37 , where a low @xmath6 oscillation signal is expected , and at small radial distances from the beam axis , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the sensitivity of the search is increased by taking into account the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath37 and @xmath48 .",
    "the presence or absence of @xmath0 oscillations is established by comparing the measured @xmath47 with the one expected in the absence of oscillations . in order to avoid biases",
    ", we adopted a `` blind analysis '' strategy : the comparison of the measured to the predicted @xmath47 is not made until the accuracy of the flux predictions and the robustness of the data analysis have been demonstrated and until all selection criteria are fixed .",
    "a number of control data samples in which no oscillation contribution is expected ( charged current interactions of @xmath2 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in neutrino mode , and of @xmath2 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath1 in antineutrino and zero - focusing modes ) are used to verify the flux predictions and the validity of the monte carlo simulation  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that no oscillation signal is expected to be measurable in @xmath50 since the intrinsic ratio of @xmath51 in the beam is four times smaller than the intrinsic @xmath52 ratio and the antineutrino statistics is limited .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath47 , pure samples of @xmath46 and @xmath32 interactions are selected .",
    "the initial data sample for @xmath46 interactions is complementary to that used in the @xmath32 selection described below , i.e. , it consists only of those events that include no muon ( identified with looser criteria than in the @xmath32 selection ) .",
    "the basic requirement is the presence of a track associated with the neutrino interaction vertex , pointing to an energy deposition in the ecal and identified as an electron in the trd and ecal .",
    "the identification criteria are :    * pulse heights in the trd consistent with those of an electron and such that isolated charged pions are rejected by at least a factor of 1000 . * a momentum - energy match satisfying : * * @xmath53 ; * * @xmath54 ; * * no activity in hcal associated with the electron trajectory .",
    "electrons from conversions and dalitz decays are rejected by requiring :    * that the first point on the candidate track be within 15  cm of the primary vertex ; * that no positively charged track , either identified as a positron in the trd or missing the trd , when taken together with the candidate electron , results in the combination being consistent with a conversion",
    ". the criteria used are the invariant mass and the angle between the plane containing the trajectories of the two tracks and the vertical .    in order to reduce further the background from neutral current and charged",
    "current events in which the muon was not identified , kinematic cuts are also applied using the following two variables :    * @xmath55 , the angle between the electron and the hadronic jet in the plane transverse to the neutrino beam direction .",
    "* @xmath56 , the component of the electron momentum perpendicular to the hadronic jet direction .    charged pions simulating secondary electrons and conversion electrons are part of the hadronic jet , resulting in small values of these variables .",
    "primary electrons are isolated resulting in large values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these differences are evident in the @xmath55-@xmath56 plots shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_qlep ] on which the cut used is also shown .",
    "-@xmath56 ( defined in the text ) for monte carlo @xmath32 and @xmath57 ( background ) events and for @xmath46 ( signal ) events , as well as for the nomad data .",
    "the events to the right of the curve were selected . ]    single track events , originating mostly from quasi - elastic and resonance production interactions , are treated somewhat differently because they are more prone to background arising from charged particles entering the detector without being registered in the veto counter and because no hadronic jet containing primary charged particles is present .",
    "the criteria used to select them are :    * no activity in the drift chambers upstream of the beginning of the track and consistent with having given rise to the track ; * the angle between the single electron and neutrino beam directions , @xmath58 , smaller than 150  mrad ; * @xmath59 ; * @xmath60 , with @xmath61 the mass of the electron , a cut that rejects neutrino - electron scattering events .",
    "lastly , only events with @xmath62  gev/@xmath63 and @xmath64  gev are retained .",
    "these selection criteria result in an efficiency for @xmath46 , estimated from the monte carlo , of 43.9% .",
    "the surviving background contribution to the @xmath46 sample is estimated , from the monte carlo , to be 1.8% .",
    "it consists mostly of electrons from photon conversions .",
    "their rejection depends critically on the reconstruction of the accompanying positron and on identifying a conversion point distinct from the primary vertex .",
    "the reconstruction of very low energy positrons and the separation of a conversion vertex from the primary vertex in a high multiplicity event could be different in the data and in the monte carlo .",
    "as a cross - check , a class of @xmath65 events that failed the kinematic cuts or were produced far from the primary vertex , and thus consisting almost entirely of background , were selected in both the data and in the monte carlo .",
    "the number of such events was found to be higher in the data by a factor that varied between 1.0 and 1.6 depending on @xmath37 . the monte carlo background estimate for the @xmath66 events",
    "was therefore multiplied by this same factor , thus raising the total background estimate to 2.3% .",
    "charged current interactions of @xmath2 are characterized by the presence of a primary muon in the final state , which had to penetrate 13 interaction lengths of absorber material to reach both muon stations in order to be identified . in addition , in order to minimize the differences between selection efficiencies of @xmath32 and @xmath46 events , we apply kinematic criteria identical to those used in the @xmath46 selection , although they are not needed for the background suppression .",
    "the resulting @xmath32 data sample has a negligible background contamination ; the average selection efficiency is 60% .",

    "the data and monte carlo @xmath68 distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc_zvtx ] for @xmath32 and @xmath46 events .",
    "it can be seen that fewer events are present in the data than in the monte carlo at small @xmath68 especially for @xmath46 events .",
    "the origin of this difference is due mostly to a cut introduced during the reconstruction of events : events with a very high density of hits in the drift chambers were not reconstructed due to a prohibitive reconstruction time . since the data has on average a higher density of hits than the monte carlo , the effect of this cut is different on the two samples .",
    "furthermore , since electrons radiate photons in traversing the drift chambers and some of these photons convert , the density of hits in @xmath46 events is large thus exacerbating the effect of the density cut for these events .",
    "the reprocessing of a sample of data and monte carlo events without this density cut resulted in @xmath68 distributions that were in much better agreement .",
    "we therefore decided to restrict the analysis to events occurring in the 72 downstream planes of drift chambers by requiring @xmath69 cm .",
    "this restriction resulted in a loss of about 30% of the @xmath46 events and 35% of the @xmath32 events .",
    "it should be noted that any oscillation effects could not manifest themselves over this distance since the point of origin of the neutrinos is spread over more than 300  m.    a total of 5,584 @xmath46 and 472,378 @xmath32 events were retained .",
