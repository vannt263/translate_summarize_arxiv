    "a precise description of neutrino - nucleus ( @xmath4 ) interactions in intermediate energy region is important for the interpretation of measurements by many neutrino experiments .",
    "the understanding of their sensitivity to neutrino properties , evaluation of the neutrino fluxes and spectra depend on the accuracy to which the @xmath4 cross sections are known .",
    "this is in particular crucial in analysis of the long - base line neutrino oscillation experiments in which the parameter of neutrino oscillation @xmath5 is determined using the total number of detected events and the distortions in the energy distribution of the detected muons caused by neutrino oscillation . on the other hand the neutrino - nucleus cross sections contain contributions from both axial - vector and vector currents and thus provide complementary information to that provided by electron - nucleus scattering , which is sensitive only to the nuclear vector current .    in many experiments",
    "the neutrino fluxes in sub - gev and gev energy region are used . at such energies",
    "the charged - current quasi - elastic ( qe ) neutrino - nucleus interactions give the main contribution to the detected events .",
    "sizable nuclear effects have been observed in lepton scattering off nucleus at energies less than a few gev .",
    "they indicate that the nuclear environment plays an important role even at energies and momenta larger than those involved in typical nuclear ground state processes .",
    "the understanding of nuclear effects is relevant for the long - base line neutrino experiments in order to control the corresponding systematic uncertainties .",
    "many monte - carlo ( mc )  @xcite codes developed for simulation of the neutrino detectors response are based on a simple picture of a nucleus as a system of quasi - free nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ a relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm )  @xcite .",
    "it takes into account fermi motion of nucleons inside the nucleus and pauli blocking effect .",
    "unfortunately the uncertainties of a few @xmath6a scattering data at low and intermediate energies do nt allow us to estimate the accuracy of this model .",
    "on the other hand , as follows from vast high - precision electron scattering data the rfgm neglects some important nuclear effects .",
    "so , the model which is used for calculation of neutrino scattering off nucleus should first be tested against electron scattering data .    in the present work we intent to evaluate the accuracy of the fermi gas model and plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) [ 3,4,5 ] .",
    "the electron qe cross sections are calculated in the framework of these models and compared with high - precision data for different nuclei .",
    "this comparison shows that the agreement between predictions of these models and data depends significantly on the momentum transfer to the target .",
    "we applied the rfgm and plane - wave impulse approximation to @xmath0c(@xmath7 ) reaction also .",

    "the transition matrix elements are calculated in the first order perturbation theory and in impulse approximation , _",

    "the general covariant form of the nuclear tensors is obtained in terms of two four - vectors , namely the four - momenta of target @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
