    "in an earlier work kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite have reported that when one uses laughlin wave function for fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states , the corresponding quasielectron ( qe ) excitations are found to have charge and statistics different from those of quasiholes ( qh ) .",
    "in fact their numerical studies show that for system sizes upto 200 electrons , quasiholes have the charge and statistics parameter @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "however for quasielectrons ( qe ) the trends regarding the charge show a slow convergence towards the expected value @xmath9 and with a finite size correction for @xmath10 electrons approximately @xmath11 , the statistics parameter @xmath1 has no defined value but might probably converge to @xmath8 in the thermodynamic limit . on the other hand kjnsberg and leinaas @xcite",
    "have shown that the composite fermion ( cf ) picture leads to a definite statistics parameter for a cfqp .",
    "jeon et.al @xcite have concluded that the composite fermion ( cf ) picture gives rise to the cfqp charge and statistics parameter given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the filling factor @xmath2 .",
    "however numerical studies @xcite using cf wave function show that at filling factor @xmath5 and @xmath14 the statistics parameter @xmath1 is found to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "though the numerical values agree with the theoretical predictions on the basis of cf model , it has opposite sign .",
    "the sign discrepancy would cast doubt on the fundamental interpretation of the cf physics . to cope with this problem",
    "these authors have suggested that the insertion of one composite fermion quasiparticle ( cfqp ) at a certain position is slightly perturbed by inserting another cfqp inside the loop which pushes the other very slightly outward .    from the above findings it appears that any of the models of quantum hall fluid seem to satisfy the observations in an unambiguous way .",
    "here we shall try to show that laughlin wave function appears to lead to the charge and statistics parameter for qe compatible with qh when we take into account that the berry phase associated with an electron having even number of flux quanta attached to it can be removed to the dynamical phase and the residual berry phase of the qe is computed considering the reduced magnetid field .",
    "indeed this helps to improve the result obtained by kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite at @xmath5 .    in sec.ii we shall briefly sketch the model of qhe on the basis of berry phase approach @xcite incorporating the fact that even number flux quanta can be gauged away when the phase is removed to the dynamical phase . in sec.iii",
    "we shall analyze laughlin wave functions for qe and qh incorporating this aspect of berry phase . in sec.iv",
    "we shall reproduce the numerical result of kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite at @xmath5 taking into account this modification .",
    "in some earlier papers @xcite we have analyzed the sequence of quantum hall states from the viewpoint of chiral anomaly and berry phase . in our approach , we have considered the spherical geometry which was first used by haldane @xcite where the electrons are confined on the surface of a sphere of large radius @xmath17 with a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath18 at the centre . in this geometry ,",
    "the single electron is represented as a spin @xmath19 , the orientation of which indicates the point on the sphere about which the state is localized .",
    "the angular momentum shells of the spherical geometry are the analogy of the landau levels ( ll ) of the planar geometry .",
    "the angular momentum relation here is given by    @xmath20    the lowest landau level ( lll ) is given by the @xmath21 shell .",
    "it may be remarked here that as @xmath22 here corresponds to the monopole strength we can relate this with the berry phase .",
    "indeed @xmath23 corresponds to one flux quantum and the flux through the sphere when there is a monopole of strength @xmath18 at the centre is @xmath24 .",
    "the berry phase of a fermion of charge @xmath0 when it moves in a closed path is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 , here @xmath10 is the number of flux quanta enclosed by the loop traversed by the particle .",
    "if @xmath18 is an integer , we can have a relation of the form @xmath27 which indicates that the berry phase associated with integer @xmath18 may be unitarily removed to the dynamical phase .",
    "this suggests that the attachment of @xmath28 vortices(magnetic flux lines ) with @xmath29 an integer to an electron effectively leads to the removal of berry phase to the dynamical phase .",
    "so , fqh states with @xmath30 can be viewed as if one vortex is attached to the electron . from the dirac quantization condition @xmath31",
    ", we can identify the filling factor @xmath32 with @xmath33 corresponding to the charge of the particle given by @xmath34 . for a higher landau level we can consider the dirac quantization condition @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being a vortex of strength @xmath37 .",
    "this can generate fqh states having the filling factor of the form @xmath38 where both @xmath36 and @xmath39 are odd integers .",
    "indeed , we can write the filling factor as @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is an even integer given by @xmath42 . in this scheme ,",
    "the fqh states with @xmath32 having the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 an even integer can be generated through particle - hole conjugate states @xmath45    these fqh states having even numerator and odd denominator filling factors can be considered as particle - hole conjugate states in this scheme .",
    "the segregation of even number of vortices helps us to consider the removal of the corresponding phase factor to the dynamical phase . to see this explicitly ,",
    "we take resort to the planar geometry when the ground state wave function is given by laughlin wave function .",
    "the ground state wave function for an @xmath10-particle system at the filling factor @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the magnetic length @xmath50 @xmath51 . now segregating the even number of vortices we consider the phase of the jastrow factor @xmath52 .",
    "we can display the phases due to the jastrow factor by writing @xmath53 where @xmath54      @xmath60    where the prime denotes the condition @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 is the unit magnetic flux quanta given by @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field is @xmath64    thus the phase of the jastrow factor is equivalent to each electron seeing a flux tube of @xmath65 on other electron . in a translationally invariant system ,",
    "the mean field hamiltonian @xmath66 may be obtained by replacing @xmath67 by the mean value @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the average electron density and by ignoring the potential energy @xmath70 , we may now write @xmath71 ^ 2 \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) d^2 r}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 .    thus the effect of the removal of the berry phase associated with even number of flux quanta to the dynamical phase is transcribed by the reduction of the magnetic field @xmath73 to @xmath74 with @xmath75 the berry phase acquired by an electron when it traverses a closed path encircling an area @xmath76 in relation to the reduced field @xmath74 is given by @xmath77    for a quantum hall state with filling factor @xmath78 , it appears that when even number of flux quanta is gauged away , the electron is attached with a magnetic flux quantum having strength @xmath79 and so we will have the phase in the reduced field @xmath74",
    "@xmath80    in the field @xmath73 , this gives rise to @xmath81 where @xmath10 is the number of flux quanta enclosed by the path .",
    "so when a particle having the total number of flux quanta @xmath82 in the field @xmath73 traverses a closed path encircling @xmath10 number of such particles , the berry phase is given by @xmath83    it is noted that in our classification scheme we have identified the filling factor @xmath32 with the local charge of the particle @xmath84 ( in unit of e ) and so we can define the berry phase by @xmath85    evidently this is analogous to the berry phase acquired by an electron when it traverses a closed path encircling @xmath10 number of electrons but is different from that of a composite fermion in the cf picture . from eqn.([2p ] ) it is observed that when a particle attached with @xmath86 flux quanta moves about another one traversing half circle the phase is @xmath87 so that the statistics parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the laughlin wave function is characterized by the fact that for one quasihole ( qh ) at the position @xmath88 it is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath32 being the filling factor .",
    "it is noted that @xmath93 is here given by @xmath94 , @xmath49 being the magnetic length . for a quasielectron ( qe ) at @xmath88 the corresponding wave function is given by @xmath95    to study the statistics parameter we need to compute the phase related to the motion of one qe(qh ) around another qe(qh ) .",
    "so , we need the construction of two qhs and qes wave functions . for two qhs at the positions @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the wave function is @xmath98    similarly for the qes at @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the wave function is given by @xmath99    now following kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite we consider a quasiparticle excitation ( qh or qe ) of charge @xmath0 localized at the position @xmath88 and is described by the normalized wave function @xmath100 .",
    "if this quasiparticle ( qp ) is moved around a closed path there arises the berry phase .",
    "if the path is a circle around the origin parameterized by @xmath101 with @xmath102 running from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , the berry connection is then defined by @xmath105    the charge @xmath0 of the quasiparticle is determined by setting the berry phase equal to the aharonov - bohm phase corresponding to the same path . evidently in a finite system",
    "the charge defined in this way will depend on the distance @xmath106 from the origin but it gives a reasonable value when the circles are well within the droplet .",
    "if the quasiparticle is described by a normalized @xmath10- particle state of the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 are expansion coefficients , @xmath109 are orthonormal basis states and @xmath110 is the normalization factor @xmath111    the expression for charge is given by @xcite @xmath112    when there are two quasiparticle excitations simultaneously located symmetrically about the origin at the positions @xmath113 with the parametrization",
    "@xmath114 we can let @xmath102 run from @xmath103 to @xmath115 which describes the interchange of two quasiparticles .",
    "if the quasiparticle state is described by a state analogous to ( [ i1 ] ) @xmath116 then a berry phase connection @xmath117 corresponding this interchange is given by @xmath118    we can now define the statistics parameter by subtracting the single particle contribution due to the magnetic field @xmath119    specifying @xmath120 for quasielectron ( quasihole ) by @xmath121 , we can write the following expression for charge and statistics parameter @xcite @xmath122    now from the wavefunctions for @xmath123 given by eqns.([ee1]),([ee2]),([ee3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , we have @xcite @xmath124    from the above results obtained by kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite , we now consider the case when the quasiparticle is subjected to the reduced magnetic field @xmath74 after the removal of the berry phase associated with even number of flux quanta to the dynamical phase .",
    "it is noted that when the magnetic field @xmath73 is reduced to @xmath74 , the corresponding magnetic length is changed from @xmath49 to @xmath125 where @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 corresponding to the filling factor @xmath2 . now considering that the ground state can be thought as the `` vacuum ''",
    ", we put the quasiparticle at the position @xmath88 such that it is subjected to the reduced magnetic field @xmath74 . the corresponding change in the value of the magnetic length @xmath125 , at filling factor",
    "@xmath46 will modify the expressions @xmath128 and @xmath129 given by eqns.([iqh ] ) and ( [ iqe ] ) @xmath130    similarly for this quasiparticles , the expressions for @xmath131 and @xmath132 will be modified as @xmath133    these changes in the expressions due to the change in the normalization factor for @xmath93 will modify the numerical results obtained by kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite . indeed , the crux of the problem related to the differences in numerical value for the charge and statistics parameter for quasihole and quasiparticles in ref.[1 ] lies in the expressions for @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in @xmath129",
    "we have the extra factor @xmath136 associated with the term @xmath137 .",
    "if we could neglect this factor @xmath136 then @xmath128 and @xmath138 would have been identical .",
    "however since the average number of electrons within unit distance from an arbitrary point @xmath88 assuming constant density within the electron droplet is @xmath139 , it is very close to @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "but when we consider the effect of the reduced magnetic field @xmath74 on the quasiparticle , this average number of electrons will change to @xmath142 for filling factor @xmath143 which is expected to improve the situation .",
    "from our above analysis it appears that when the quasiparticle ( qh or qe ) is subjected to the reduced magnetic field @xmath74 , the expression for @xmath144 in unit of @xmath125 will change the parameter @xmath106 to @xmath145 .",
    "similarly , the parameter related to the distance between two quasiparticles will also be modified .",
    "taking into account this modification we have reproduced here the numerical results for the charge @xmath146 and statistics parameter @xmath1 obtained by kjnsberg and myrheim @xcite in figs .",
    "1,2,3 and 4 .",
    "it is to be remarked that as in the present formalism a quasiparticle is not a conventional point like anyon , rather it has an extended structure as certain magnetic flux lines are attached to it , the size of a quasiparticle can be taken to be of the order of one magnetic length . in view of this",
    "we plot here the values from @xmath147 .",
    "it is found that , as expected the charge and statistics parameter fits very well with the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively in case of quasiholes as shown in figs 1 and 3 .",
    "it may be noted that below @xmath148 , we have observed appreciable deviation from the value @xmath149 and @xmath6 as has been shown in fig 2 and 6 @xmath150 reported in ref.[1 ] .",
    "however , in case of quasielectrons , we note that the slight deviation from the exact value for the charge @xmath149 is minimal for different values of @xmath10 in the range @xmath147 to @xmath151 .",
    "similarly the average value of the statistics parameter @xmath1 for quasielectrons becomes close to the value @xmath8 within the range @xmath147 to @xmath151 and it deviates largely when @xmath152 increases .",
    "in fact it is expected that we should consider the result within this range as the edge effect becomes prominent beyond this . in the perspective of spherical geometry the size of the droplet @xmath17",
    "is given by @xmath153 . to be consistent with the distance",
    "coordinates @xmath145 , we have to consider the droplet size @xmath154 .",
    "so even for @xmath155 , with @xmath141 , we note that @xmath156 is of the order of @xmath157 units of magnetic length .",
    "so it is expected that the edge effect will be minimal only in the range @xmath147 to @xmath151 .",
    "indeed it has been observed that all important physics at the edge is not one dimensional but leads to the formation of striped phase at @xmath5 caused by long ranged coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the charge density oscillations decays slowly only as a power law with the distance from the edge .",
    "it is found that at @xmath5 the quantum hall edge undergoes a reconstruction as the background potential softens , whereas quantum hall edges at higher filling factors are robust against reconstruction @xcite . since the edge physics at @xmath5",
    "is not confined to the boundary but extends to the bulk , we should consider our results within a specific range @xcite .",
    "however , as the size of the droplet varies as @xmath158 , it is expected that the situation will improve for large @xmath10 .",
    "= 8.0 in = 8.0 in    = 8.0 in = 8.0 in    = 8.0 in = 8.0 in    = 8.0 in = 8.0 in    in view of these considerations we can argue that the deviation from the exact value of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for charge and statistics parameter at @xmath5 is to be interpreted in terms of the nature of the quasiparticles and edge physics and it is expected that we will have exact value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have pointed out that when the effect of the removal of the berry phase associated with even number of flux quanta to the dynamical phase is taken into account , we get better estimates of the charge and statistics parameter of the quasiparticles . again taking into account the edge effect in the bulk which is found to be very prominent at the filling factor @xmath5 , the departure from the expected value for the charge and statistics parameter for quasielectrons @xmath149 and @xmath6 can be explained .",
    "it may be recalled that in the composite fermion picture the value of the statistics parameter @xmath1 is predicted to be @xmath159 for @xmath5 .",
    "though the numerical computation agrees with the magnitude , it differs in sign .",
    "this raises doubt on the fundamental interpretation of the cf physics . to cope with this problem",
    "it has been suggested that the insertion of a certain cfqp at a point perturbs the other cfqp by pushing it to slightly outward from the loop .",
    "it is to be remarked that the present formalism does not incorporate the conventional point anyon picture .",
    "indeed quasiparticles are particles attached with magnetic flux quanta and hence should be treated as extended bodies .",
    "fractional charge and hence fractional statistics is found to be an outcome of dirac quantization condition .",
    "it may be noted that in this formalism the very definition of filling factor @xmath32 is associated with the charge @xmath34 derived from the dirac quantization relation .",
    "this is consistent with experimental results and is identical with the predictions of the cf theory in case of fqh states with @xmath160 ( @xmath126 being an odd integer ) .",
    "but there is a controversy regarding the charge of quasiparticles in the fqh states with the filling factor @xmath161 . in the cf model",
    "the predicted charge of the quasiparticles with @xmath161 is always @xmath162 which is supposed to be supported by experiments at a bit higher temperature @xcite but is in contrast to the experimental result @xcite where it is shown that the charge of the quasiparticles are @xmath163 and @xmath164 at @xmath165 and @xmath166 at extremely low temperature .",
    "in this context we may add that the dirac quantization condition which is a consequence of quantum field theory at @xmath167 ( no finite temperature effect is taken into account ) our result is expected to be valid in the close vicinity of @xmath167 .",
    "however at higher temperature it may happen that for quasiparticles with @xmath161 , the system is dissociated into @xmath36 copies of quasiparticles with charge @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "finally we may add that as it has been discussed in the previous section , the edge effect is most prominent at @xmath5 , it is expected that the numerical experiments will give better result for other filling factors such as @xmath169 and so on . in a future study",
