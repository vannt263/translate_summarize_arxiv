    "silicon photonic microring resonator ( mrr)-based filters , modulators , and switches have been investigated for use in data - centers and high performance computing systems due to their high - speed operation , low power consumption , and compact device footprints @xcite .",
    "many of the benefits exhibited by mrr - based devices are due to their resonance characteristics , which also makes their performance highly susceptible to variations in fabrication and to fluctuations in both the chip temperature and the laser s wavelength . in order to overcome these issues for practical deployment of mrr - based technologies",
    ", it is required to develop scalable , low - cost , and energy efficient techniques for wavelength tuning and stabilization of mrr - based devices @xcite .",
    "automatic wavelength tuning and stabilization of mrr - based devices is typically achieved using feedback loops , which require both sensing and controlling the resonance conditions of the mrrs .",
    "the sensing operation can be performed using on - chip temperature sensors @xcite or , alternatively , using photodetectors ( pds ) to monitor the light intensity at the output ports of @xcite , or inside @xcite , the mrrs .",
    "techniques that require light to be tapped out from the mrrs or their outputs in order to be monitored with on - chip pds do not scale well towards densely integrated systems due to the increases in device footprint and insertion losses .",
    "in contrast , sensing mechanisms based on monitoring the light intensity in the mrrs with in - resonator pds are more scalable .",
    "for example , in - resonator pds can be fabricated that utilize defect state absorption ( dsa ) as the photodetection mechanism @xcite .",
    "dsa is the process of electron - hole pair generation by sub - bandgap defect energy levels , formed primarily as a result of ion implantation @xcite .",
    "previous demonstrations have required dedicated ion implantation steps to create a sufficient number of defect states for absorption @xcite .",
    "the control operation can be performed using thermo - optic ( to ) @xcite , or electro - optic  ( eo ) @xcite , phase shifters to tune the resonance wavelength of the mrrs .",
    "the to phase shifters are typically implemented using metallic @xcite or doped - silicon @xcite resistive heating elements and are widely used for tuning mrrs due to the large to coefficient of silicon . for wavelength stabilization",
    ", these heating elements are typically used together with dedicated pds inside or outside of the mrrs .",
    "recently , germanium - based in - resonator photoconductive heaters have been demonstrated for both sense and control operations @xcite , thereby avoiding the need for dedicated pds . however , these devices required the deposition of germanium , increasing the complexity of fabrication .",
    "the to or eo tuners can be driven by microcontrollers @xcite or cmos electronic circuits @xcite .",
    "the control algorithms for wavelength stabilization can be based on thermal dithering @xcite , homodyne locking @xcite , or maximum / minimum point searching @xcite techniques .    in this paper , we demonstrate automated wavelength tuning and stabilization of mrr filters using in - resonator photoconductive heaters ( irphs ) .",
    "irphs are formed using doped waveguide sections [ see fig . [ fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the doping allows the irphs to be used as resistive heaters , but also provide a means of photodetection due to dsa . in this work , the doped heaters built into the mrrs , i.e. irphs , are used for both the sense and the control operations . as a result , no dedicated ion implantation steps , germanium depositions , or dedicated on - chip pds are required for automated stabilization of the mrrs .",
    "furthermore , the use of irphs allows for a simple and scalable method for tuning higher - order series - coupled mrr filters since the tuning state of an mrr can be measured using the mrr s irph .",

    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",

    "in this section , we characterize the photoconductive behavior of irphs , which can be used to monitor and control the light intensity in mrr - based filters .",

    "grating couplers were used to couple light in to and out of the chip .",
