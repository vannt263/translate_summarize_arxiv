    "over the last decade the amount of available astronomical data on the large - scale structure of the universe has grown rapidly , locally , as in the the two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs )  @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite , and in surveys at higher redshifts , such as deep  @xcite , deep2  @xcite and the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels )  @xcite .",
    "upcoming programs and instruments like the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst )  @xcite promise maps of the distribution and properties of galaxies in even higher detail .",
    "this increasingly precise observational picture requires equally accurate theoretical models for understanding structure formation and the nature of dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de )  @xcite .",
    "the prospects for such theoretical calculations are in principle bright , because the initial conditions for cosmic structure formation are tightly constrained through measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite . the @xmath10 cold dark matter ( @xmath10cdm ) paradigm favored by these data implies that the cosmos is filled with three distinct components : baryons , dm and de , and although the physical nature of dm and de remain unknown , their evolution can be followed far into the non - linear regime using collisionless n - body simulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , such simulations by themselves can not predict the distribution of galaxies made up of baryonic matter , severely limiting their utility as a means to directly connect with the observations .",
    "there are two approaches for establishing this link : ( i ) through a post - processing procedure known as semi - analytic modelling , in which the output of n - body simulations is combined with simple physical prescriptions to estimate the distribution of galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( ii ) through directly accounting for the baryonic component ( gas , stars , supermassive black holes , etc . ) in cosmological simulations that include hydrodynamics and gravity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in principle offering a self - consistent and fully predictive approach",
    ". however , the vast computational challenges related to simulations of the baryonic component have thus far precluded wide - spread adoption of this approach .",
    "large - scale predictions of the galaxy population have thus mainly been obtained with the semi - analytic method during the past few decades .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have become more prominent over the last several years , and a significant number of results have been published from them  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these cosmological simulations of the formation of representative galaxy populations are different from studies where the computational power is focused on a single galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "although such `` zoom - in '' simulations offer higher mass and spatial resolution , they do not yield a statistical sample of objects to compare to observations , which limits their ability to falsify certain model aspects .",
    "however , when used in conjunction with large - scale simulations , the zoom - in procedure is clearly essential for constructing more reliable sub - resolution models for characterising entire galaxy populations . ideally both approaches should be pursued simultaneously to learn more about the complex problem of galaxy formation .",
    "hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations typically include sub - resolution models for star formation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radiative cooling processes ( primordial and metal - line )  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "recently , more `` explicit '' forms of feedback have been included  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which require however much higher spatial and mass resolution , something which is currently out of reach for large - scale hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "nevertheless , such detailed models might lead to new effective models , which can then be adapted for large - scale simulations .    here",
    "we present first results of the illustris simulation , the most ambitious large - scale hydrodynamical calculation of structure formation to date , first described in @xcite .",
    "our model incorporates a broad range of astrophysical processes that are believed to be relevant to galaxy formation  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) : gas cooling with radiative self - shielding corrections , energetic feedback from growing supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and exploding supernovae ( sne ) , stellar evolution and associated chemical enrichment and stellar mass loss , and radiation proximity effects for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the simulation starts at redshift @xmath11 ( @xmath12 million years after the big bang ) and follows the evolution of @xmath6 resolution elements in a volume of @xmath0 .",
    "we achieve a dm mass resolution of @xmath13 , and an initial baryonic mass resolution of @xmath14 . the smallest scale ( corresponding to the smallest fiducial cell radius ) over which the hydrodynamical euler equations are solved with the moving - mesh technique arepo  ( described in",
    "* ) is @xmath5 at @xmath3 .",
    "the mass and spatial resolution are thus comparable to state - of - the - art large - scale n - body simulations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the galaxy population is inspected more closely in section  4 .",
    "we demonstrate here that our model reproduces key observables of the local universe and the cosmic star formation rate density over cosmic time .",
    "we also discuss the colours of galaxies and the impact of environment on galaxy evolution and specifically on the red fraction of galaxies .",
    "section  5 focuses on the internal structure of galaxies based on well - resolved sample galaxies taken from the simulation , demonstrating that our model correctly predicts the velocity structure of galaxies and the morphological mix of early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "we give a detailed summary of our results in section  6 and our conclusions in section  7 .",
    "readers interested in the main results are encouraged to read section  6 , which summaries the most significant findings of the present work .",
    "finally , section  8 briefly describes upcoming data releases and details about distribution of the simulation data to the community .",

    "following the dynamics of dm and gas accurately requires a highly reliable and efficient numerical scheme to solve the coupled system of partial differential equations describing gravity and hydrodynamics .",
    "we use the recently developed moving - mesh code arepo code  @xcite to solve the inviscid euler equations .",
    "it has been demonstrated that such a moving - mesh approach is typically superior to traditional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) , and especially in the presence of large bulk velocities also to eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr )  ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "besides calculating gravitational forces and hydrodynamical fluxes , our simulations account for astrophysical process known to be crucial for galaxy formation .",
    "our implementation is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this model includes gas cooling ( primordial and metal line cooling ) , a sub - resolution ism model , stochastic star formation with a density threshold of @xmath17 , stellar evolution , gas recycling , chemical enrichment , kinetic stellar feedback driven by sne , procedures for supermassive black hole ( smbh ) seeding , smbh accretion and smbh merging , and related agn feedback ( radio - mode , quasar - mode , and radiative ) .",

[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     for our simulations we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the latest wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)-9 measurements  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the initial conditions is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main simulations of the illustris project are summarised in table  [ table : illustris_sims ] .",
    "illustris-(1,2,3 ) represent our principal simulations which include hydrodynamics and our galaxy formation model .",
    "the different resolution levels ( 1,2,3 ) provide a convergence study in which the mass resolution is changed by a factor of @xmath25 in total , and the spatial force resolution by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "the level-1 simulation initially consists of @xmath27 hydrodynamic cells and the same number of dm particles . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the simulation contains @xmath28 gas resolution elements , @xmath29 stellar particles , and @xmath30 smbh particles .",
    "the number of dm and tracer particles ( see below ) is fixed as a function of time ( i.e.  @xmath31 each ) .",
    "we employ a fixed comoving softening length for dm particles ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the softening length for baryonic collisionless particles ( stars and smbhs ) is further limited to a maximum physical scale ( @xmath33 ) . for gas cells we use an adaptive softening length which is proportional to the fiducial cell size with an additional floor applied .",
    "this floor is given by the softening length of the other collisionless baryonic particles .",
    "our ( de- )  refinement scheme keeps the masses of cells close to within a factor of two of a target mass ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "furthermore , we employ a regularisation scheme , which steers the mesh towards its centroidal configuration  @xcite .",
    "illustris-1 has a large dynamic range , resolving gravitational dynamics down to about @xmath4 ( at @xmath3 ) , while at the same time following the large - scale evolution in the full @xmath0 volume . at @xmath3",
    "the smallest cells in illustris-1 have a typical extent ( fiducial radius ) of only @xmath5 , which is the smallest scale over which the gas hydrodynamics and baryonic processes are resolved . for the least massive cells we achieve a mass resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "the illustris - dark-(1,2,3 ) simulations use the same initial conditions but do not include the baryonic component .",
    "illustris - nr-(2,3 ) include baryons , but do not include any feedback , sf , or cooling processes ( non - radiative ) .",
    "through this combined set of simulations we can , for example , study the impact of baryons and feedback processes on the distribution of dm , as we will demonstrate below .",
    "we use a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm  @xcite ( linking length of @xmath36 times the mean particle separation ) to identify dm haloes with a minimum particle number of @xmath37 . other particle types ( stellar particles , gas cells , smbh particles )",
    "were attached to these fof primaries in a secondary linking stage  @xcite .",
    "the subfind algorithm was then used to identify gravitationally bound structures  @xcite .",
    "each subhalo has a well defined mass based on the particles which are bound to it .",
    "however , haloes are composed of many subhaloes and different mass definitions for haloes are commonly used .",
    "the most basic definition assigns the total fof mass to a halo ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "another common approach defines the halo mass to be the mass @xmath39 , defined as the mass which is contained in a spherical region with average density @xmath40 times the critical density of the universe at that time .",
    "there are different choices for @xmath40 possible , for example : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , or @xmath43 , where the last value comes from a spherical top - hat collapse model  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will mainly use @xmath41 , and refer to @xmath44 for the corresponding mass and @xmath45 for the enclosing radius .",
    "whenever we refer to a virial mass and virial radius we mean @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . for more massive haloes ( groups and clusters ) we will also quote @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which are more closely related to observationally derived quantities of clusters .    the structure finding procedure yields @xmath48 fof groups with more than @xmath37 particles and @xmath49 individual ( sub)haloes at @xmath50 in illustris-1 .",
    "the largest fof group at @xmath50 , a cluster - mass halo with a total mass of @xmath51 , contains over @xmath52 million dm particles , @xmath53 million voronoi cells , and @xmath54 million stellar particles .",
    "based on the snapshots and group catalogues , we have constructed different types of merger trees , for example using an extended and updated version of lhalotree  ( also used for the millennium simulations * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and rockstar  @xcite , and the newly developed sublink code  ( rodriguez - gomez et al . , in prep ) .",
    "each snapshot of illustris-1 amounts to about @xmath55 of raw particle data , whereas a snapshot of illustris - dark-1 adds up to @xmath56 . for each simulation",
    "we generate @xmath57 snapshots , yielding a cumulative data volume of more than @xmath58 . to facilitate efficient access to individual groups ,",
    "( sub)haloes , and galaxies , the raw particle data are stored in sorted order in output files according to the subfind grouping . with the help of an offset table , this allows for a quick retrieval of any bound structure in the snapshots with minimal i / o requirements .",
    "we have furthermore extended subfind to also group non - fof particle / cell data such that the environment of specific haloes can be easily read from disk .",
    "furthermore , subfind was extended to compute and store many galaxy properties , such as stellar luminosities in various broadband filters ( sdss and johnson ) , galaxy masses , galaxy stellar metallicities , gas metallicities , neutral hydrogen content , etc . , which greatly simplifies subsequent analysis .            for definiteness",
    ", we derive the various galaxy properties from the gravitationally bound mass that is contained within a radius @xmath59 that equals twice the stellar half mass radius of each subfind ( sub)halo .",
    "unless mentioned otherwise , we will always measure galactic properties ( masses , light , sf rates , etc . ) within the @xmath59 radius .",
    "0.5 cm        besides writing snapshots for the total simulation volume at @xmath57 specific times , we have selected four disjoint small subboxes ( denoted as sub - a , sub - b , sub - c , sub - d ) for writing their data at every high - level synchronisation point of the simulations .",
    "this yields @xmath60 snapshots for each of the four subboxes in illustris-1 ; i.e.  the time spacing is about @xmath61 times finer than in our standard snapshots . at @xmath62",
    "the time spacing between two subbox outputs is therefore about @xmath63 , and at @xmath3 about @xmath64 .",
    "the different subboxes cover nearly the same volumes at different places in the simulation volume : sub - a : @xmath65 , sub - b : @xmath66 , sub - c : @xmath67 , sub - d : @xmath67 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "these subboxes contain in sub - a @xmath68 , in sub - b @xmath69 , in sub - c @xmath70 , and in sub - d @xmath71 dm particles .",
    "the large variation in the number of resolution elements in these subboxes is mainly due to the very different regions they sample , although the box sizes are also slightly different .",
    "the present day matter density @xmath72 in the volumes is @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , for sub - a to sub - d , respectively .",
    "the stellar content @xmath77 is also different , amounting to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for sub - a to sub - d .",
    "these numbers demonstrate that sub - a samples an overdense region , whereas the other regions are underdense with the most extreme case given by sub - b .",
    "the fine time spacing of these subboxes can be used for detailed studies of dynamical processes in different environments .",
    "all hydrodynamical illustris simulations include monte carlo tracer particles to follow the gas flow accurately  @xcite .",
    "for each tracer , we record @xmath82 different hydrodynamical quantities ( e.g. ,  maximum past temperature and maximum past density ) , and we follow the evolution of @xmath83  billion monte carlo tracer particles in total .",
    "these tracers faithfully follow all conversion and exchange processes in the baryonic component of the simulation ( e.g. gas turning into stars , stars returning mass to the gas phase , ejection into the stellar wind state , accretion into smbhs , etc ) .",
    "the inclusion of tracer particles increases the total particle number of illustris-1 to more than @xmath8 billion .",
    "we note that we use explicitly only mc tracer particles instead of traditional velocity field tracer particles typically employed in amr codes to avoid biases in the mass fluxes  ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    we need to transform stellar information of our simulations into photometric properties , i.e. stellar light in different filters , to compare the simulated galaxy population with observations .",
    "stellar population synthesis models  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide a straightforward way to associate the stars in our simulations with observable spectra or broad band luminosities .",
    "colours were assigned using an rgb mapping of the ( g , r , i ) bands using a @xmath84 scaling  ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the volume of illustris is sufficiently large to measure large - scale statistics .",
    "we demonstrate this below for a few selected quantities , and especially highlight the importance of taking baryonic effects into account since they affect structure formation in a way that can not be captured by dm - only simulations or semi - analytic models applied to them in post - processing . before presenting these statistics we will first give some visual overview of the simulation and one of the subboxes , demonstrating their power in disentangling physical processes on short time - scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustris ] gives a pictorial overview of our simulation volume at the present day , redshift @xmath3 .",
    "dark matter forms the backbone of the cosmic structure , as displayed in the top portion of the figure .",
    "this invisible form of matter , potentially made up of neutralinos or axions , is arranged in an intricate cosmic web  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with tenuous filaments surrounding large voids and connecting gravitationally bound haloes in which galaxies form through gas condensation and star formation  @xcite . on large scales",
    ", the gas density follows the evolution of the dm ( middle panel ) , which dictates the gravitational field with its five times higher mass density .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations provide important additional information about the gas besides the density , e.g. , its temperature , entropy and velocity fields , as illustrated ( from left to right ) in the bottom panels of the figure .    the dm and gas slice shown in figure  [ fig : illustris ]",
    "is centered on a galaxy cluster with a virial radius ( @xmath45 ) of @xmath85 and a virial mass ( @xmath44 ) of @xmath86 .",
    "this particular cluster , shown enlarged in different figure insets with some of its predicted observational signals , contains @xmath87 resolved subhaloes within its virial radius ( @xmath88 within its larger fof group ) , consistent with the expected population of such subhaloes in a cdm model  @xcite .",
    "the large inset on top shows the cluster s expected @xmath89-ray annihilation signal within three virial radii if the elusive dm consists of a majorana particle that can self - annihilate  ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "annihilation is a two - body process ; i.e. the annihilation signal is proportional to @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the distance along the line - of - sight .",
    "the three insets in the top right of figure  [ fig : illustris ] show maps of various observational diagnostics of the central cluster .",
    "they include the x - ray emission from hot gas in the cluster within one virial radius ( top right inset ) , where the main contribution comes from bremsstrahlung ( @xmath92 ) emission from the hot ( @xmath93 ) intra - cluster gas .",
    "we also show the expected thermal sunyaev - zeldovich signal  @xcite , which is due to inverse compton scattering of background photons of the cosmic microwave background by hot electrons in the cluster plasma .",
    "the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich signal of clusters is an important cosmological probe that is being measured , for example , by the planck satellite  @xcite , the south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite , and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we show the expected distribution of metals in cluster gas in the lower right inset .",
    "these predictions are possible because our simulation traces the evolution of nine different chemical elements as they are synthesised in stars and dispersed by galactic winds .",
    "ionisation states of these elements can be calculated in post - processing and can be compared in detail to quasar spectra probing the circum - galactic medium  ( suresh et al , in prep ) .",
    "finally , in the upper left panel we show an optical image ( in g , r , i sdss broadband filters ) of the central galaxy that formed in the cluster ; a massive red elliptical galaxy . for comparison , we also show a typical disk galaxy ( lower on the left ) that we preferentially find in the field , away from clusters .",
    "these two galaxies differ not only in their morphologies and colours , but also in their present - day star formation rates .",
    "the red elliptical galaxy has essentially no ongoing star formation whereas the blue disk still forms stars .",

    "this is sufficiently short to capture a brief episode of strong quasar activity , where agn radiation alters the cooling rates of nearby gas and heats up this gas on a very short time scale .",
    "the bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : subbox_radiation ] shows the bolometric flux within this halo , and the right panel shows the temperature evolution of gas belonging to the halo .",

    "this can be caused by different effects probably related to quenching in massive haloes .",
    "firstly , it seems that our radio - mode agn feedback is not efficient enough to suppress sf sufficiently in massive haloes as mentioned above . too little quenching can lead to stellar populations which are too young and therefore biased towards bluer colours . a second reason for the less pronounced second maximum lies potentially in the rather small sample of massive objects in our simulation volume .",
    "for example , we have only ten haloes with masses above @xmath121 ( c-1 to c-10 , see above ) .",
    "the massive part of the galaxy population is therefore not captured well , and could potentially be biased due to the initial density field that is sampled by the simulation .",

    "although we do not include dust effects , we also show observational sdss results ( thin gray lines ) in the different panels of figure  [ fig : color_hist ] .",
    "this reveals another qualitative agreement of our model with observations : only intermediate mass galaxies show a bimodal distribution .",
    "despite the fact that we do not include dust effects , we find for some mass ranges reasonable agreement with the observed colour distribution .",
    "however , in the intermediate mass regime the predicted quantitative colour distribution clearly deviates from the observed samples . here",
    "we miss a significant fraction of red and quenched galaxies , which are observed , but not present in our model .",
    "this relates to the fourth reason for why our total colour distribution is not as bimodal as found observationally : we miss a significant fraction of red and quenched galaxies in the intermediate mass range .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by looking at the quenched fraction as a function of galaxy mass  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we have also added model predictions from  @xcite based on a semi - analytic model run on the millennium - i and -ii simulations n - body simulations . at higher masses",
    "our simulation results agree well with the semi - analytic predictions from  @xcite .",
    "however , both models tend to produce too few red galaxies at the massive end , and the maximum u - i values agree well between the two models , but are too low compared to observations .",
    "furthermore , both models predict a rather narrow and peaked distribution , which is not observed . instead in the massive mass bins observations favor a broad distribution extending to u - i colours larger than @xmath179 . at lower masses",
    "we find galaxies which are bluer than observationally found , but dust effects can in principle compensate for this .              as demonstrated above , sn and agn feedback",
    "are key processes in regulating sf and in determining the stellar mass content of haloes . however , many studies have also established the view that the evolution of galaxies is a strong function of environment , both observationally  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretically  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based on various measures used to quantify galaxy environments  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) .",
    "galaxies entering high density regions like clusters are prone to processes like ram pressure stripping , starvation , strangulation , and tidal stripping , which are captured self - consistently by hydrodynamical simulations , a major advantage over ad hoc treatments employed in semi - analytic models .",
    "these physical processes are significant because they influence , for example , the sf rates and colours of galaxies as a function of environment .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : colours ] , where we present the average ( g - r ) colours of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and local galaxy overdensity @xmath170 at @xmath3 . the overdensity field is calculated based on the fifth nearest galaxy considering only systems with @xmath180-band magnitude @xmath181 for the construction of the galaxy density field at @xmath3 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath182 galaxies from which we calculate the local overdensity field ( @xmath170 ) for each other galaxy that we can correlate with other galaxy properties .",
    "we note that this procedure is commonly adopted in observational studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : colours ] demonstrates that galaxies tend to be redder at larger stellar masses and at higher galaxy overdensities , in accord with observations .",
    "these two `` reddening axes '' are however related to entirely different physical processes . quenching of massive galaxies proceeds mostly through agn feedback in large haloes , which is associated with the heating and removal of large amounts of interstellar gas so that star formation ceases and the galaxy starts to redden as its stellar population ages .",
    "environmental quenching due to denser surroundings primarily affects lower mass satellite galaxies , which are stripped of their gas as they experience ram pressure when falling into larger haloes .",
    "next we explore more quantitatively the dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and @xmath170 in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : environment ] . here",
    "we present the un - weighted average red fraction in each bin with a threshold of @xmath183  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the results again demonstrate that galaxies tend to be redder for larger stellar masses and higher galaxy overdensities as defined through @xmath170 .",
    "we stress that the trends we recover in this panel are qualitatively in good agreement with recent observations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to make this clearer we also include observational contour lines for a red fraction of @xmath184 from  @xcite",
    "the dashed line is the original result from  @xcite , whereas the shifted line represents a mass and overdensity shift to fit better to our data .",
    "the observational contour line was defined based on a different galaxy overdensity @xmath170 , and a different definition of red fraction .",
    "we have therefore shifted this line by @xmath185 in mass , and @xmath186 in overdensity .",
    "interestingly , this brings the general shape of the contour line into good agreement with our results .",
    "most importantly , we recover the drop in the red fraction around @xmath187 at higher overdensities . however , the shifted contour line coincides with the simulated contour line for a red fraction of @xmath188 ( black line ) , but not with that of @xmath184 .    .",
    "the coloured line represents the total galaxy population , whereas the solid and dashed black lines denote centrals and satellites , respectively .",
    "the colour of the line simply reflects the red fraction on the y - axis .",

    "in fact , it has been pointed out that most of the common environment indicators , among them @xmath170 , are to some degree correlated with halo mass  ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they are therefore not strictly probing environmental effects , but are `` contaminated '' also by the halo mass dependence .",
    "other characteristics of probing the impact of the environment on galaxy properties have therefore been proposed by  @xcite .",
    "we consider this in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : environment ] , where we use @xmath189 , the three - dimensional distance to the nearest neighbour with a virial mass that is at least that of the halo under consideration , divided by the virial radius of the nearest neighbour , to probe the environment  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "this estimator aims to minimise any halo mass dependence in the direction of the vertical axis . using this estimator",
    "we still recover two different quenching mechanisms : mass - quenching along the horizontal axis and environment - quenching along the vertical axis .",
    "although the upper left and upper right panels of figure  [ fig : environment ] look similar , they differ in the dependence of the red fraction as a function of @xmath170 and @xmath189 for fixed stellar masses around @xmath187 .",
    "the estimator @xmath189 does not show an equally strong drop in the red fraction towards higher overdensities compared to @xmath170 .",
    "this might be related to the fact that @xmath170 is still contaminated by a remaining halo mass dependence as pointed out by  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the two upper panels of figure  [ fig : environment ] also differ at the highest overdensities and lowest masses , but in the opposite direction : the @xmath189 measure has its upper - left corner very blue again , which is not the case for @xmath170 .",
    "the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : environment ] combines the stellar mass halo mass relation and the fraction of red galaxies .",
    "sf is most efficient around @xmath151 where the galaxy population is dominated by blue star forming galaxies which populate the sf main sequence ( see below ) . towards lower and higher masses ,",
    "sf becomes less efficient and the fraction of red galaxies increases in both directions due to quenching , which is consistent with observations  @xcite .",
    "although the red fraction depends on environment , it is observationally found that the sf rate of star forming galaxies does not depend on @xmath170 , but only varies as a function of mass in the @xmath190 plane  @xcite .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : environment ] demonstrates that we recover the same trend in the simulation . here",
    "we present the average sf rate as a function of stellar mass and galaxy overdensity @xmath170 for star - forming galaxies using the same cut as discussed above ( see discussion of the gsmf , and colours ) .",
    "gray lines in the lower right panel represent contour lines from @xcite .",
    "these lines are essentially parallel to the contour lines predicted by the simulation demonstrating that our model describes the observational finding correctly .",
    "we note that this result is not in conflict with those presented in the upper panels .",
    "the fact that the red fraction of galaxies increases with @xmath170 combined with a @xmath170-independent sf rate only implies that the sf rate itself does not depend on environment , whereas the quenching and reddening probability is a strong function of environment .",
    "both observationally and theoretically this points towards a rather rapid process that quenches and reddens galaxies in higher density environments .",
    "we summarise the dependence of the galaxy red fraction on the stellar mass , the specific star formation rate , the bh mass , and galaxy overdensity in the four panels of figure  [ fig : redfraction ] .",
    "the coloured line represents the total galaxy population , whereas the solid and dashed black lines denote centrals and satellites , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the red fraction on ssfr does not show any strong dependence on the galaxy type ( centrals and satellites ) , and therefore we do not include the central and satellite lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : redfraction ] reveals some clear trends of the red fraction .",
    "the first panel emphasises the strong increase of the red fraction with increasing stellar mass . as emphasised above red galaxies",
    "have typically only little ongoing sf which can also be seen from the second panel .",
    "here we find a rather steep drop of the red fraction around a specific sfr of about @xmath191 .",
    "below ( above ) this threshold , we find only a low number of blue ( red ) galaxies .",
    "also as discussed above agn feedback of smbhs plays an important role in quenching star formation towards more massive halo masses .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the red fraction increases with black hole mass as shown in the third panel .",
    "the galaxy environment also shapes the galaxy colours and affects the red fraction as demonstrated above .",
    "the last panel of figure  [ fig : redfraction ] demonstrates this clearly .",
    "interestingly , the red fraction in centrals and satellites differs significantly towards higher overdensities . for an observationally employed density estimator like @xmath170",
    "we find that around @xmath192 centrals tend to be significantly redder than satellites of the same overdensity .",
    "the results in this section demonstrate that sf formation , quenching , and reddening are deeply connected through feedback processes and environment effects , most of which are recovered by our model reasonably well .",
    "although our effective ism model prevents us from making detailed predictions about the internal gas structure of galaxies , we can still estimate coarse grained quantities , and test those predictions against observations .",
    "we will demonstrate this in what follows for a few observables , and we will also show that our model produces a reasonable mix of early- and late - type galaxies . furthermore , the more massive galaxies in our simulation volume are resolved well enough to study the detailed distribution of stars in them .    before studying specific details of the galaxy population we present in figure  [",
    "fig : galevolve_image ] the redshift evolution of two galaxies based on stellar images in rest frame g , r , i bands .",
    "one of the galaxies evolves into a red elliptical galaxy ( top ) , and the other one ( bottom ) into a blue star - forming spiral galaxy .",
    "we trace these galaxies back in time for more than @xmath193 until @xmath62 as indicated in the figure .",
    "the images reveal that both galaxies undergo some mergers .",
    "for example the red galaxy experienced a dry merger around @xmath194 resulting in shell like structures in the stellar image at @xmath195 .",
    "the shells are not prominent anymore at @xmath3 , where we find a smooth and featureless light distribution . the blue late - type galaxy in the bottom of the figure also undergoes a merger around @xmath196 resulting in the formation of a dominant bar , which is clearly visible around @xmath197 and still noticeable at @xmath3 .",
    "some of the blue galaxy s images also show star - forming regions as knots in the light distribution . by @xmath3",
    "these systems have evolved into very different galaxies , which differ strongly in their morphology , colour , and specific star formation rates .",
    "we trace the history of these two galaxies more quantitatively in figure  [ fig : galevolve ] , where we show their evolutionary paths together with the distributions of all galaxies at @xmath3 . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : galevolve ]",
    "we present the distribution of all galaxies as a function of stellar mass and sf rate at @xmath3 .",
    "the colour coding in the histogram shows the average ( g - r ) colour of galaxies in each bin .",
    "the green band shows the observed sf main sequence  @xcite which is in good agreement with the predictions of our model .",
    "we also include the evolutionary paths of the two galaxies shown in figure  [ fig : galevolve_image ] .",
    "the early - type red galaxy ( circle symbol ) shows a rapid late - time drop in sf , which is absent for the blue galaxy ( star symbol ) .",
    "this is caused by quenching through radio - mode agn feedback .",
    "the star formation rate decreases by more than one order of magnitude from @xmath198 to @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) and subsequently by a similar factor from @xmath199 to @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) at which point sf of the central galaxy shuts off completely , which is why we show no data point for the early - type galaxy at @xmath3 .",
    "the colour of the symbols indicates the actual g - r colour of the galaxy at the particular time .",
    "one can clearly see how the elliptical galaxy reddens while its sf is reduced by feedback . on the other hand ,",
    "the blue galaxy has @xmath203 until about @xmath204 .",
    "then sf is slightly reduced and the galaxy turns slightly redder , but is still significantly bluer than the red elliptical at late times .",
    "the symbol sizes for the two galaxies are proportional to the stellar half mass radius normalised for each galaxy evolution track individually .",
    "the red galaxy seems to grow substantially from @xmath199 to @xmath201 .",
    "this is due to the dry merger happening around that time leading to a more extended stellar distribution .",

    "the composite images of the blue galaxies ( b-1 to b-42 ) in figure  [ fig : blue_galaxies ] reveal several interesting features .",

    "star - forming regions in spiral arms clearly stand out as blue connected knots .",
    "the opening angle and winding of the spiral arms varies similarly to what is found observationally along the hubble sequence .",
    "interesting features can also be found in the light distribution of the redder galaxy sample ( r-1 to r-42 ) in figure  [ fig : red_galaxies ] . since we did not make any cuts on morphology some galaxies appear to have disk like features .",
    "a few of the galaxies like r-2 , r-7 , and r-11 show shell like structures .",

    "the ( g - r ) color values are , by selection , also consistently higher for the red sample compared to the blue galaxies .",
    "the reddening of the red galaxies is due to quenched sf which leads to an older stellar population and therefore redder stellar light .",
    "the red galaxies have massive smbhs which cause agn feedback , a key process in quenching massive systems .",
    "in fact , the smbh population for the blue galaxies is significantly less massive than the population of the red galaxies .",
    "we note that some of the red massive systems are quenched so strongly that they have essentially no on - going star formation anymore ( e.g. , r-2 , r-3 , etc . ) .",
    "galaxies are ordered by halo mass in table  [ table : galaxies ] .",

    ", this resolution is sufficient to explore the internal structure of the galaxies .",
    "we demonstrate this by inspecting the internal mass structure of some of the blue galaxies by constructing circular velocity profiles , @xmath223 .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] .",

    "the contribution of the gas component is sub - dominant compared to the stellar and dm contribution .",
    "similar results were found by  @xcite using zoom - in simulations of eight milky way - sized haloes from the aquarius project  @xcite using the illustris galaxy formation model . the largest gas contribution over the sample is @xmath224 , however in most cases the maximum contribution from the gas component is around @xmath225 .",
    "the vertical lines in figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] show our fiducial galaxy radius ( @xmath59 ) corresponding to twice the stellar half - mass radius .",
    "the various panels of figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] also demonstrate how the stellar circular velocity curve and the dm circular velocity curve add up to a very flat total circular velocity curve .",
    "the inner parts of the galaxy are clearly dominated by the stellar mass . beyond @xmath59",
    "the dm contribution to the circular velocity curve dominates for all galaxies over the stellar contribution .",
    "the circular velocity curves stay flat out to @xmath226 for all galaxies shown in figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] .",
    "we also include in each panel the same eight circular velocity curves for the aquila haloes taken from @xcite ( gray thin lines ) .",
    "we note that our mass and spatial resolution is inferior to these simulations .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that the circular velocity curves are reasonably well converged even if the mass resolution is changed by a factor of @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , the initial rise and the exact location of the maximum of the circular velocity curve can still vary to some degree ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "a study of the full galaxy population is provided in @xcite , where average circular velocity curves for the whole population , for a wide range of masses , and several redshifts are presented .",
    "there we also study the impact of baryons on the maximum circular velocity .",
    "disk galaxies are observationally found to follow the tully - fisher relation ( tfr )  @xcite relating stellar luminosities ( masses ) to internal kinematics via the circular velocities .",
    "it has been shown that this relation becomes even tighter when the circular velocities are correlated with the total baryonic mass instead of the luminosities or stellar masses , leading to a very tight baryonic tfr ( btfr )  @xcite .",
    "we note that the btfr is a strong prediction of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond )  @xcite as an alternative of cdm .",
    "we present the btfr of the @xmath227 disk like galaxies of figure  [ fig : blue_galaxies ] in the left panel of figure  [ fig : tf_baryon ] along with recent observations including @xmath126 uncertainty bands  @xcite .",
    "we measure the total baryonic mass within @xmath59 , and for the circular velocity we take the total mass within that radius and calculate the associated circular velocity  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath59 radii are shown as dashed brown lines in the circular velocity curves of figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] , demonstrating that this radius lies already within the flat regime of the circular velocity curve .",
    "our results for the tfr are therefore not very sensitive to this choice .",
    "contain fewer than @xmath228 stellar particles which is insufficient for a reliable galaxy type classification . despite the small mass range covered",
    ", we find that the simulation correctly describes the transition from the bulge - dominated regime for more massive systems to the disk - dominated regime for lower mass galaxies .",
    "we employ the same b / t cut as @xcite and find that the ` crossing point ' of the galaxy types is predicted to be at nearly the same mass within the two galaxy formation models.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the btfr of the disk galaxies in our simulation ( represented here by this small sample ) agrees well with the overall observational constraints , demonstrating that the internal structure of the stellar disks are characterised reasonably well , and that cdm models can reproduce the observed btfr .",
    "interestingly , our model predicts a btfr which is closer to the tightest observational constraints  @xcite than recent state - of - the - art zoom - in simulations  @xcite although our numerical resolution for these galaxies is significantly below the resolution of the zoom - in results .",
    "the very tight and steep btfr is observed for a gas - rich galaxy sample , which is expected to give a more accurate measure of the slope and the normalisation of the btfr than obtained from star - dominated spiral galaxies .",
    "although our simulation results agree with the predicted scatter of @xcite the spread of our btfr is still much larger than the results of  @xcite .",
    "also the slope is not as steep as predicted by that study .",
    "we note that a more detailed exploration of the btfr has to take into account the full sample of well - resolved spiral galaxies , and also take into account the actual rotation velocities .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : tf_baryon ] shows the stellar tfr for the same selected disk galaxy sample compared to different observations  @xcite ;  i.e. we plot the same velocity as in the left panel now as a function of stellar mass instead of total baryonic mass .",
    "we also show the theoretical predictions of @xcite for the aquila haloes .",
    "our galaxies follow a similar trend as the high - resolution aquila haloes : we recover the correct slope and amount of scatter in the relation .",
    "however , it seems that our results indicate slightly too high circular velocities .",
    "this is also true for the aquila galaxies of @xcite .",
    "the blue and red galaxy samples discussed so far were selected `` by eye '' to be representative for distinct classes of galaxies . in the following we would like to characterise in more detail the morphological galaxy mix as a function of stellar mass . however , we are severely limited by our mass resolution to properly model and characterise galaxy types of systems that are only resolved by a few tens of thousands of stellar resolution elements .",
    "in fact , reliably identifying the type of a galaxy requires substantially more particles , and we will not attempt to quantify the morphological type of galaxies for systems that are resolved with less than @xmath229 stellar particles resulting in a lowest stellar mass of about @xmath230 . automatically classifying galaxy types for less well - resolved objects",
    "is rather difficult and the obtained results are highly uncertain .    for the well - resolved objects with @xmath231 we will apply a kinematic bulge - to - disk decomposition .",
    "specifically , we follow @xcite and define for every star particle with specific angular momentum @xmath232 around a selected @xmath16-axis a circularity parameter @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the maximum specific angular momentum possible at the specific binding energy @xmath235 of the star .",
    "we define a @xmath16-axis based on the star - forming gas , or the stars , if there is no star - forming gas in the system , which can occur in more massive and heavily quenched systems . having the circularities of all stellar particles of the system we can then determine the fraction , @xmath236 , of particles with circularities above @xmath237 .",
    "these stars are typically classified as disk stars  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we then calculate the bulge - to - total ratio ( b / t ) as @xmath238 for each galaxy .",
    "this gives for every galaxy a bulge - to - total ratio for the stellar component based on the circularities of the stars .",
    "based on those values we can then split the distribution of galaxies into different types . here",
    "we follow the cuts applied in @xcite , where the morphological types of galaxies based on the millennium - i and -ii ( ms - i , ms - ii ) simulations combined with a semi - analytic model were compared to observations from  @xcite .",
    "as described above we can probe the morphological types only for the most massive galaxies in our sample due to the resolution requirements ,  i.e. we can probe the types only over a much smaller range than @xcite , for example .",
    "we present our results in figure  [ fig : dtratio ] , where we compare our findings to the observations of  @xcite and to the predictions of the semi - analytic model of  @xcite ( based on the ms - ii ) .",
    "although figure  [ fig : dtratio ] only probes the most massive systems in our simulations , we find that we recover the observed trends for the mass dependence of the different galaxy types .",
    "most importantly , we find the correct transitional behaviour from more disk - like systems at lower masses to bulge - dominated systems towards larger stellar masses . over this mass range we find a similar level of agreement with the observations as the predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , this should not be over - interpreted since the comparison to observations is not unique due to the different techniques that were applied to extract the morphological types in the observations and the simulations .",
    "our cuts are identical to those applied in @xcite , and it is therefore interesting that we find a similar `` crossing - mass '' of about @xmath239 as the semi - analytic prediction .    as a final point of comparison between our model and an observable of the local universe , we also investigate the age of the stellar populations in galaxies . this quantity can be inferred observationally and can therefore be used to test our model .",
    "simply speaking , sf in galaxies is either biased towards earlier or later periods of structure formation , depending on the galaxy type : early - type galaxies form most of their stellar content early , whereas late - type galaxies show more late sf activity .",
    "this `` downsizing '' effect , which is ultimately caused by baryonic processes like feedback , works therefore contrary to the hierarchical bottom - up build - up of cdm , where larger systems like clusters assemble later .",
    "we can inspect downsizing in our model by plotting the mass - weighted stellar age of simulated galaxies against their stellar mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : stellar_age ] .",
    "we compare here to two observational datasets : one derived from a large sdss sample  @xcite , and a second one based on a sdss subset biased towards early - type galaxies  @xcite .",
    "we find reasonable agreement within the scatter and the total sample .",
    "most importantly , we recover the correct trend of age downsizing .",
    "however , low - mass systems ( @xmath240 ) tend to form their stars too early in our simulation ; i.e.  they are too old compared to observations .",
    "we stress that this tension is shared by semi - analytic models and other state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations alike , pointing towards an open problem in low - mass galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether new more explicit feedback models can resolve this problem  @xcite .    .",
    "however , low mass systems tend to be too old compared to the full observational sample .",
    "they seem to agree better with the early - type subset .",
    "this problem of low mass galaxies being too old is shared with the model of @xcite , which predicts even older galaxies around @xmath187.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "we have introduced the illustris project , a series of large - scale hydrodynamical and dm - only simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "the highest resolution simulation , illustris-1 , covers a volume of @xmath0 , has a dark mass resolution of @xmath1 , and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of @xmath2 . at @xmath3 gravitational forces",
    "are softened on scales of @xmath4 , and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have a fiducial radius of @xmath5 .",
    "the simulation follows the evolution of @xmath6 resolution elements and additionally evolves @xmath7 passive monte carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than @xmath8 billion .",
    "the free parameters of our model are set to physically plausible values and have been constrained based on the star formation efficiency using smaller scale simulations  @xcite and with minor modifications in high - resolution zoom - in simulations of individual milky way - like haloes  @xcite .",
    "they were also used in recent magneto - hydrodynamical simulations of milky way - like haloes  @xcite .    in this first paper and a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "we have presented initial results focusing on the galaxy population at @xmath3 .",
    "high redshift results are presented in @xcite .",
    "we will summarise in the following our main results .",
    "* impact of baryons on the halo mass function : * we find that galaxy formation physics affects the halo mass function at low and high halo masses , leading to a reduction of the overall abundance by up to @xmath137 at both ends . in these mass ranges",
    "baryonic feedback processes are strongest . for intermediate mass haloes",
    "we find deviations below @xmath241 .",
    "our radio - mode implementation leads to a significant reduction in halo mass also towards higher masses , which is different from previous findings  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which do not include agn feedback .",
    "we note , however , that other implementations of radio - mode feedback may yield a different outcome at higher halo masses .",
    "* impact of baryons on halo masses : * related to the change in the mass function we also find that individual halo masses are significantly affected by baryonic physics : haloes less or more massive than @xmath230 have up to @xmath168 less mass in illustris-1 compared to matched haloes in the corresponding dm - only simulation .",
    "these trends differ from most previous results , where the strongest impact of baryonic physics was found towards lower halo masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , our energetic agn feedback also causes halo masses to differ substantially in more massive systems .",
    "intermediate mass haloes around @xmath230 tend to be more massive in the hydrodynamical simulation by about @xmath242 .",
    "* cosmic star formation rate density : * by construction , the build - up of stellar mass predicted by our galaxy formation model agrees well with observations .",
    "we have tested our results against recent measurements of the cosmic star formation rate density .",
    "we find good agreement with observations up to @xmath243 , although our model predicts slightly too much present - day star formation which is dominated by galaxies with stellar masses about @xmath244 . at high redshifts",
    "we find good agreement of our model with recent lower limits of the cosmic star formation rate densities . beyond @xmath134",
    "our model agrees best with the shallowest slope ( @xmath135 ) of recent best - fit slopes for combined @xmath132 measurements ( @xmath133 ) by @xcite .",
    "* galaxy stellar mass and luminosity functions : * the present - day abundance of galaxies both as a function of stellar mass and stellar luminosity agrees well with observations of the local universe as indicated by a comparison with sdss based observations .",
    "we stress that for both quantities there are significant observational measurement uncertainties in the stellar light assignment at the bright and massive end  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that we take into account by providing two stellar light and mass estimates .",
    "we find reasonable agreement of our simulation with observations over a substantial mass ( @xmath245 ) and luminosity range ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "we also find good agreement with the stellar mass function of star - forming galaxies , and reproduce the measured fraction of `` red and dead '' galaxies at the massive end : for @xmath159 we find that about @xmath160 of all stellar mass at @xmath3 is in galaxies with a low sf rate , which agrees reasonably well with observations of  @xcite ,    * baryon conversion efficiency : * we have compared the baryon conversion efficiency of our model to recent abundance matching results , where we recover the inferred observation results within the @xmath126 uncertainties .",
    "baryon conversion is most efficient around halo masses @xmath247 , and drops quickly for lower and higher mass systems due to sn and agn feedback .",
    "our model predicts a maximum efficiency of about @xmath248 at halo masses slightly above @xmath249 in reasonable agreement with the findings of abundance matching techniques , although the results of @xcite peak at higher masses than those of @xcite .",
    "the exact amplitude and location of the peak predicted by our model also depends on the exact definition of stellar mass : considering the total stellar mass of the halo , excluding satellites , peaks at a slightly higher mass than the efficiency based on the galactic stellar mass only . however , this uncertainty is smaller than the differences between different abundance matching results .",
    "we stress that the interplay of sn and agn feedback is crucial to reproduce this result and especially the shape of the stellar mass to halo mass relation .",
    "* colours of galaxies : * in this first paper we have studied only intrinsic g - r and u - i colours of galaxies neglecting the important effect of dust . given this caveat ,",
    "we find a bimodal colour distribution which has a significantly less pronounced maximum at red colours compared to observations .",
    "the most massive galaxies with @xmath250 peak around @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath251 to @xmath252 mass range shows a clear bimodal distribution with broad maxima at @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "lower mass systems around @xmath187 show a broad maximum at @xmath253 .",
    "our low and high mass results agree reasonably well with observations and predictions from the recent semi - analytic models of  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not match the colours of intermediate mass systems .",
    "a more detailed study taking into account the effects of dust is required to understand this discrepancy better .",
    "we divide the galaxy population also into central and satellite galaxies finding that for all galaxies above @xmath254 the red part of the g - r and u - i distribution is dominated by satellites . for galaxies more massive than @xmath255",
    "we find however that centrals dominate the red maximum of the distribution in both colours . we have also inspected the red fraction of galaxies as a function of stellar mass , specific star formation rate , and bh mass .",
    "the most rapid transition from blue galaxies to red galaxies can be found as a function of specific star formation rate , where our model predicts a sharp transition from blue to red around @xmath256 .",
    "the transition as a function of bh mass and stellar mass is significantly broader .    *",
    "the impact of environment on the galaxy population and mass and environment quenching : * we have studied galaxy colours ( g - r ) and red fractions as a function of stellar mass ( @xmath205 ) and galaxy overdensity ( @xmath170 ) , where @xmath257 was constructed based on the distance to the fifth nearest neighbouring galaxy with an r band magnitude brighter than @xmath258 .",
    "we recover qualitatively the observational trends of mass and environment quenching .",
    "specifically , we recover the observational trends of  @xcite when plotting the red fraction as a function of mass and galaxy overdensity .",
    "interestingly , we also reproduce the drop in the red fraction around @xmath187 for high galaxy overdensities @xmath259 , where a slightly shifted @xmath184 red fraction contour line agrees remarkably well with our simulation predictions .",
    "we demonstrate that this high density drop in the red fraction is less pronounced once the environment is characterised with an estimator that is less contaminated by a remaining halo mass dependence ( @xmath189 taken from @xcite indicating that @xmath257 is not ideal in probing environmental effects alone  ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "our model also reproduces the observed environment independence of star formation rates for star - forming galaxies in agreement with the findings of  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that high density environments increase the probability of galaxies being quenched , but does not directly affect the star formation rates of non - quenched , star - forming , galaxies .",
    "* morphology of galaxies : * the numerical resolution of illustris is sufficient to study the internal structure of relatively more massive galaxies ( @xmath260 ) , which are resolved with more than @xmath229 stellar resolution elements .",
    "we have constructed small samples of red and blue galaxies ( r-1 to r-42 and b-1 to b-42 ) which are well - resolved and representative of our galaxy population .",
    "a visual classification of these galaxies reveals that our model clearly yields a significant population of star - forming blue disk - like galaxies co - existing with quenched red elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have extended this classification to all galaxies with @xmath221 using a kinematic bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "we find that our simulation correctly describes the transition from late type galaxies to early types as a function of stellar mass .",
    "we have compared the relative fractions in both populations with the observational sample from @xcite and the semi - analytic prediction of  @xcite finding good agreement among the three .",
    "interestingly , our model predicts the same transition mass @xmath239 , the mass where the fraction of early- and late - types both equals @xmath261 , as the recent semi - analytic model of  @xcite using very similar cuts in the bulge - to - disk ratios for the galaxy type classification .",
    "* circular velocity curves and tully - fisher relation : * we have constructed circular velocity curves for a few selected late - type spiral galaxies with halo masses between @xmath167 and @xmath262 .",
    "all selected galaxies show steeply rising circular velocity curves which then become flat towards larger radii .",
    "the gas contribution to the circular velocity profiles is not significant and typically is at most @xmath263 and in rare cases @xmath264 .",
    "our model reproduces the observed stellar and baryonic tully - fisher relation reasonably well .",
    "we have demonstrated this based on a small subset of spiral galaxies . as a function of stellar mass",
    "these galaxies tend to lie a few @xmath265 above the observed trend .",
    "the slope and spread of the baryonic tully - fisher relations is reproduced when compared to the observations of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not reproduce the steep slope and small scatter of the relation found by  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the baryonic tully - fisher of our selected sample agrees slightly better with observations than the recent high resolution simulations of  @xcite .",
    "* stellar ages : * our galaxy formation model works well for most of the observational probes considered here .",
    "however , the stellar ages of low mass galaxies are not predicted correctly .",
    "specifically , we recover the correct trend of downsizing with respect to stellar ages , but low mass galaxies ( @xmath266 ) are a factor two to three too old compared to observational constraints , which point towards very young stellar populations for these masses . in our simulation , these systems tend to form their stars too early .",
    "the agreement at higher masses , where our galaxies are resolved better , is good .",
    "although the failure at low stellar masses could be related to resolution effects , we doubt that this can fully explain the discrepancy .",
    "* summary : * in summary we find that the illustris simulation is able to reproduce many of the observed trends in the local universe reasonably well .",
    "there are still some discrepancies related to the stellar ages of low mass galaxies and the quenching of massive galaxies , which require further investigation .",
    "we also stress that it is not advisable to tune galaxy formation models such that they reproduce any observation exactly . for example , the systematic errors at the bright end of the galaxy stellar mass function  @xcite have to be considered when constructing a galaxy formation model .",
    "the same is true for reproducing the stellar to halo mass relationship , which is also uncertain towards higher masses  @xcite .",
    "different abundance matching results differ also towards lower halo masses  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and they might even break down towards dwarf - scale masses  @xcite .",
    "such systematic uncertainties have to be considered when trying to match observational data with semi - analytic models or hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "special care needs to be taken when invoking new physical mechanisms for feedback or star formation to accommodate certain aspects of observational data if systematic errors have to be considered . reproducing observational data",
    "perfectly does not imply a correct and physically meaningful model .",
    "we have demonstrated in this study that state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations like illustris are capable of reproducing a significant amount of observational data both on large and on small scales .",
    "those simulations have now reached the mass and spatial resolution of recent large - scale dm only simulations .",
    "although not every observed relation is reproduced precisely by our model , it seems that the most important aspects of galaxy formation may have been identified . a model universe like illustris",
    "can now be used to refine our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "the way to move forward is to identify remaining problems of the model , where the predictions severely disagree with observational data .",
    "one such prediction is the age distribution of low mass galaxies , which conflicts with observations .",
    "furthermore , at the massive end we find that our agn feedback is not efficient enough to lead to sufficient quenching of massive galaxies .",
    "understanding these problems will lead to better insights into the relevant physics .    ) and stars outside the galaxy .",
    "a similar division is made for the gas , where we divide between gas belonging to the interstellar medium , and other halo gas , which is gravitationally bound .",
    "the thick gray line shows the increase of the total metal content on the same linear scale normalised to unity at @xmath3 .",
    "our simulation predicts `` metal equipartition '' at @xmath267 such that each baryon phase holds about one third of the total metal content in the universe . at all other redshifts",
    "the situation is rather different , for example , at high redshifts halo gas largely dominates the metal budget .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    besides comparing to observational data it is crucial that galaxy formation models also make distinct predictions that can be tested in the future to falsify certain aspects of the model .",
    "our galaxy formation model , for example , also follows the build - up and distribution of metals as described above .",
    "metals can be found in many different `` baryonic phases '' in the universe .",
    "they are produced in stars and distributed into the cgm and igm via sn driven winds .",
    "we can use our simulation to predict in which baryonic phase we expect metals to be found at various redshifts . a first coarse attempt of this is presented in figure  [ fig : metals ] , where we distinguish three main baryonic phases : stars , gravitationally bound gas , and gas which is not bound to any halo .",
    "we further subdivide the stellar contribution into stars which belong to the galaxy ( @xmath268 ) , and those which are part of the outer halo .",
    "we make an additional distinction for bound gas where we separate star - forming interstellar gas from non - star forming gas .",
    "cold and dense gas forms stars , which subsequently synthesise metals .",
    "this explains why the contribution of metals in stars is increasing and the relative contribution in the gas phase is decreasing .",
    "sn driven winds enrich the intergalactic medium , leading to more metals in this diffuse phase at later times .",
    "interestingly , our simulation predicts a kind of `` metal equipartition '' at @xmath267 such that each baryonic phase holds about one third of the total metal content in the universe . at all other redshifts",
    "the situation is rather different , for example , at high redshifts halo gas largely dominates the metal budget .",
    "our simulation provides therefore detailed predictions of the evolving metal abundances in all baryonic phases that can potentially be probed through upcoming observations allowing us to understand better the complicated `` baryon cycle '' of galaxies .",
    "it remains to be seen how well these predictions can be tested in the future and what physical insight can be extracted through even more detailed comparisons between simulations and observations .",
    "the illustris simulation data in the form of various group catalogues , merger trees ( subhalo- , halo- , and galaxy - based ) , light - cone mock observations , pre - processed snapshot data in hdf5 format allowing access to every stored quantity at all redshifts , galaxy images , galaxy spectra and broad - band magnitudes , etc . will be made available in the near future .",
