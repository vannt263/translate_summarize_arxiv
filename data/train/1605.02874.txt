    "the simultaneous flow of immiscible fluids through porous media has been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "it is a problem that lies at the heart of many important geophysical and industrial processes .",
    "often , the length scales in the problem span numerous decades ; from the pores measured in micrometers to researvoir scales measured in kilometers . at the largest scales ,",
    "the porous medium is treated as a continuum governed by effective equations that encode the physics at the pore scale .",
    "the problem of tying the pore scale physics together with the effective description at large scale is the upscaling problem . in 1936 ,",
    "wycoff and botset proposed a generalization of the darcy equation to immiscible two - phase flow @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to reread wycoff and botset s article .",
    "this is where the concept of relative permeability is introduced .",
    "the paper is eighty years old and yet it is still remarkably modern .",
    "capillary pressure was first considered by richards as early as 1931 @xcite . in 1940 , leverett combined capillary pressure with the concept of relative permeability , and the framework describing essentially all later analysis of immiscible multiphase flow in porous media was in place @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the concepts of relative permeability and capillary pressure as solution to the upscaling problem , dominates still today but other theories exist .",
    "these theories are , as is relative permeability , based on a number of detailed assumptions concerning the porous medium and concerning the physics involved .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present a new theory for flow in porous media that is solely based on a thermodynamic balance between work done on the flowing fluids and the disspation in them . in the same way as buckley and leverett s analysis based on the conservation of the mass of the fluids in the porous medium led to their buckley - leverett equation @xcite , the balancing of work per time against dissipation leads to the new equations we present in the following .",
    "the theory we present rests on non - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite which combines conservation laws with the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "the structure of the theory is reminiscent of the structure of thermodynamics itself : we have a number of variables that are related through general thermodynamic principles leaving an equation of state to account for the detailed physics of the problem .",
    "we only consider here _ isotropic _ porous media where the local flow always points in the opposite direction of the pressure gradient .",
    "it will be defered to later to consider more general systems .",
    "we also consider for now the pressure gradient as the only driving force in the system .    in section [ system ]",
    "we describe the porous medium system we consider .",
    "we review the key concepts that will be used in the subsequent discussion .",
    "in particular , we discuss the relation between average seepage velocity and the seepage velocities of each of the two fluids .",
    "we then ask the central question : given the average seepage velocity and the saturation , is this enough to determine the seepage velocities of each of the two fluids ?",
    "the answer seems to be  no , \" and we demonstrate why .",
    "however , in section [ diss ] we use non - equilibrium thermodynamics to balance dissipation in the two - fluid system against the power supplied to it by the pressure difference across it .",
    "we demonstrate that the splitting of the dissipation into that of each fluid is unique . in section [ scaling ]",
    "we use a scaling argument resting on the euler theorem for homogeneous functions to set up the framework allowing us to derive a set of equations relating the average seepage velocity , the saturation and the seepage velocities of each of the two fluids .",
    "section [ saturation ] contains the derivation of these equations . in section [ non - eq ]",
    "we summarize briefly the theory and point out the role played by the constitutive equation .",
    "we derive in section [ fractional ] a fractional flow equation , which essentially is a rewriting of one of the two central equations in section [ saturation ] .",
    "section [ solving ] contains solutions to the two equations of section [ saturation ] .",
    "we obtain integral expressions for the two fluid seepage velocities which are closed by combining them with the constitutive equation . in section [ 2examples ] , we demonstrate the use of the formulas derived in the previous section to relate a given average seepage velocity as function of saturation to the seepage velocities of each of the two fluids . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we analyze data obtained through a numerical pore scale network model @xcite . section [ relperm ] uses the relative permeability equations as constitutive equations demonstrating that the equations derived in section [ saturation ] lead to equations between the relative permeabilities and between the capillary pressure and the relative permeabilities .",
    "this leads to problems for the relative permeability formulation as the equations predict that at least one of the relative permeabilities must depend on the ratio between the viscosities of the two fluids .",
    "we conclude that relative permeability theory is not thermodynamically consistent . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we write down the full set of equations to describe immiscible two - phase flow in porous media , equations ( [ conc-1 ] ) to ( [ conc-7 ] ) based on our theory .",
    "it reduces the problem from a two - phase fluid problem to a one - phase fluid problem with the saturation as a conserved , extra variable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive a set of equations on the continuum level where differentials make sense from non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we define a _ representative elementary volume _  rev  as an isotropic block of porous material filled with two immiscible fluids with no internal structure : it is fully described by a small set of parameters which we will now proceed to define .",
    "we will then imagine the volume of the rev shrinking to zero so that the equations we derive become pointwise equations .",
    "these equations may then be supplemented by conservation laws to produce a full set of flow equations in the same way as is done with the relative permeability equations .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the rev .",
    "it is a block of homogeneous porous material of length @xmath0 and area @xmath1 .",
    "we seal off the surfaces that are parallel to the @xmath0 direction .",

    "the porosity is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the pore volume .",
    "is the _ effective _ pore volume that exclude any irreducible wetting fluid or residual non - wetting fluid . ] due to the homogeneity of the porous medium , any cut orthogonal to the axis along the @xmath0 direction ( named the @xmath4 axis for later ) will reveal a _ pore area _ that fluctuates around the value @xmath5 .",
    "the homogeneity assumption consists in the fluctuations being so small that they can be ignored .",
    "there is a pressure drop @xmath6 across the rev as shown in fig .",
    "this leads to a time averaged volumetric flow rate @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the rev is isotropic so that @xmath7  and other volumetric flow rates  are in the direction of the negative pressure gradient .",
    "the volumetric flow rate consists of two components , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which are the volumetric flow rates of the more wetting ( @xmath10 for  wetting \" ) and the less wetting ( @xmath11 for  non - wetting \" ) fluids with respect to the porous medium .",
    "we have @xmath12    in the porous medium , there is a volume @xmath13 of _ incompressible _ wetting fluid ( excluding the irreducible contents of wetting fluid ) and a volume @xmath14 of _ incompressible _ non - wetting fluid so that @xmath15 .",
    "we define the wetting and non - wetting saturations @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we have that @xmath18    we define the wetting and non - wetting pore areas @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the parts of the pore area @xmath21 which is filled with the wetting or the non - wetting liquids respectively . as",
    "the porous medium is homogeneous , we will find the same averages @xmath19 and @xmath20 on any cut through the cylindrical porous medium orthogonal to the axis .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "we pose here the central question that will be answered positively in the next two sections : _ from knowledge of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in equation ( [ eqn5.4 ] ) , is it possible to determine @xmath33 and @xmath34 , defined in equation ( [ eqn5.1 ] ) and ( [ eqn5.2 ] ) ?",

    "this turns out not to be correct . by balancing the dissipation in the rev against the power delivered to the rev by the action of the pressure difference @xmath6",
    ", we arrive at unique split of the average seepage velocity @xmath31 into @xmath33 and @xmath34 based on the basic laws of thermodynamics .",

    "the steady state assumption also leads to @xmath66 through equations ( [ eqn14 - 3 ] ) to ( [ eqn14 - 5 ] ) .",
    "we integrate the expression for the entropy production ( [ eqn14 - 9 ] ) over the pore volume of the rev , giving the dissipation @xmath67 in the system , @xmath68= a_p\\left[c_w\\delta\\mu_w \\overline{v}_w+c_n\\delta\\mu_n \\overline{v}_n\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the chemical potential differences between the entrance and the exit of the rev for the fluids",

    "what has been accomplished here is ( 1 ) a unique split of the average seepage velocity @xmath31 into two velocities @xmath57 and @xmath58 associated with the dissipation in each fluid and ( 2 ) we have shown that @xmath7 is a thermodynamic variable .",
    "as we shall see in section [ numerical ] , in small systems @xmath57 and @xmath58 defined in equations ( [ eqn14 - 11 ] ) and ( [ eqn14 - 12 ] ) , are not identical to the seepage velocities defined in equations ( [ eqn5.1 ] ) and ( [ eqn5.2 ] ) since they are different averages . however , in the thermodynamic limit which is the continuum limit , they will be equal due to the system being self averaging , and we have @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "the volumetric flow rate @xmath7 , which we now recognize as a thermodynamic function , is a _ homogeneous function of order one _ of the two areas @xmath19 and @xmath20 defined in equations ( [ eqn3 ] ) and ( [ eqn4 ] ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath84 is a scale factor , we may scale the two areas @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "it may be implemented in pratice by using different porous media samples with different areas @xmath1 .",

    "this gives @xmath89 where it is understood that we keep the pressure drop @xmath6 constant during the partial differentiations .",
    "equation ( [ eqn11 ] ) is essentially the euler theorem for homogeneous functions of order one . by dividing this equation by @xmath21",
    ", we have @xmath90 by comparing this equation to ( [ eqn15 - 1 ] ) using ( [ eqn15 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eqn15 - 3 ] ) , we find @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "let us return to the scaling equation ( [ eqn10 ] ) which we combine with the expression for the total flow in terms of the seepage velocities @xmath33 and @xmath34 , equation ( [ eqn14.9 ] ) .",
    "in order for @xmath7 in this equation to obey the scaling relation ( [ eqn10 ] ) , neither @xmath33 nor @xmath34 can be extensive in the variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath93 they are homogeneous functions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 of order zero .",
    "hence , they must depend on the areas @xmath19 and @xmath20 through their ratio @xmath94 , where we have used equations ( [ eqn3 ] )  ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath95    the scaling relation ( [ eqn10 ] ) implies changing the wetting and non - wetting pore areas @xmath19 and @xmath20 by changing @xmath21 , but without changing the saturations @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we now change the saturation while keeping the total pore area @xmath98 constant .",
    "mathematically , this is accomplished by changing our variables from @xmath99 to @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we calculate @xmath103\\;,\\ ] ] where we have used ( [ eqn10 - 2 ] ) and ( [ eqn10 - 3 ] ) .",
    "we divide by the area @xmath21 which is kept constant and find @xmath104 this equation is a direct consequence of scaling assumption ( [ eqn10 ] ) .",
    "this equation is one of the two fundamental equations that constistute the main result presented in this paper .",
    "the second equation we find by taking the derivative of equation ( [ eqn5.4 ] ) with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath105 = v_w - v_n+s_w \\frac{dv_w}{ds_w}+(1-s_w)\\frac{dv_n}{ds_w}\\;.\\ ] ] combining this equation with equation ( [ eqn18 ] ) , we have the equation @xmath106 which is our second main result .",
    "also this equation is a consequence of the scaling assumption ( [ eqn10 ] ) alone and does not entail any further assumpions about the properties of the flow problem .    equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) is in fact the _ gibbs - duhem equation , _ in disguise , see e.g.  reference @xcite .",
    "let us lastly in this section remark that the darcy or superficial velocities @xmath107 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related to the seepage velocities by @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "hence , equations ( [ eqn18 ] ) and ( [ eqn20 ] ) will not change if expressed in terms of these velocities instead of the seepage velocities .",
    "we note that the three equations ( [ eqn5.4 ] ) , ( [ eqn18 ] ) and ( [ eqn20 ] ) are related in such a way that given any two of them , the third follows .",
    "we have accomplished to construct a non - equilibrium thermodynamic theory for immiscible two - phase flow in porous media @xcite .",
    "there are three velocities , @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these are the responses to the pressure difference @xmath6 .",
    "lastly , there is the saturation .",
    "the three velocities are bound together by the two equations ( [ eqn18 ] ) and ( [ eqn20 ] ) .",
    "hence , three variables remain : say @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath111 .",
    "they will be related through a _ constitutive equation _ @xmath112",
    "it is through this equation that the detailed physics enters the description .",
    "we note that this equation plays the same role as an _ equation of state _ in thermodynamics .",
    "the equations we have derived refer only to velocities , saturation and pressure gradient .",
    "hence , the non - zero volume of the rev has dropped out and the two equations may be seen as applying pointwise in a continuous porous medium . if the three equations ( [ eqn18 ] ) , ( [ eqn20 ] ) and ( [ eqn20.1 ] ) are supplied with a conservation law for the saturation , a complete descpription of porous media in the continuum limit ensues .",
    "we elaborate on this in the conclusion and discussion section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we define the wetting and non - wetting fractional flows as @xmath113 and @xmath114 where we have used equations ( [ eqn5.1 ] ) and ( [ eqn5.2 ] ) .",
    "we now combine these expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 with equation ( [ eqn18 ] ) to find @xmath117\\;.\\ ] ] by solving for @xmath115 , we find @xmath118    hence , we have derived a new _ fractional flow equation _ relating the fractional flow to the total flow rate and the saturation .",
    "again , no further assumptions have been made concerning the flow apart from the scaling relation given in ( [ eqn10 ] ) .",
    "all that is needed to determine the fractional flow is contained in the average seepage velocity @xmath119 , i.e. , in the constitutive law ( [ eqn20.1 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ eqn18 ] ) and ( [ eqn20 ] ) may be integrated to find @xmath33 and @xmath34 as functions of @xmath32 .",
    "we start by transforming equation ( [ eqn18 ] ) into @xmath120 equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) may then be subtracted from this equation to give @xmath121 by using equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) once again , we find @xmath122    we integrate equations ( [ eqn36 ] ) and ( [ eqn37 ] ) finding @xmath123 and @xmath124    as with the fractional flow equation ( [ eqn27 ] ) , only the average seepage velocity @xmath119 is needed to determine seepage velocities for each of the fluids . this is no surprise as @xmath115 and @xmath33 convey the same information about the system .",
    "we now give a couple of analytically tractable examples of the use of equations ( [ eqn40 ] ) and ( [ eqn41 ] ) .    first a trivial example .",
    "suppose that surface tension between the two fluids is negligible .",
    "the total average seepage velocity ( [ eqn5.4 ] ) is @xmath125 for @xmath126 and it is @xmath127 for @xmath128 . if the wetting fluid has a viscosity @xmath42 and the non - wetting fluid a viscosity @xmath43 , we have @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130 must be linear in @xmath32 : @xmath131 and we must have @xmath132 and @xmath133 so that @xmath134\\;.\\ ] ] equations ( [ eqn40 ] ) and ( [ eqn41 ] ) give since @xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137 as it should be .        we may also test the fractional flow equation ( [ eqn27 ] ) for this simple case . using @xmath130 from ( [ eqn42 ] )",

    "hence , to first order in @xmath147 the two fluids behave as if they were miscible and both having the same effective viscosity",
    ". however , the constitutive equation ( [ eqn20.1 ] ) describing the mixture may still be more complicated than the darcy equation even if the two fluids each are newtonian @xcite .",

    "however , equation ( [ eqn18 ] ) dictates that this point is also the point at which @xmath31 is minimal . in this case",

    "[ fig7 ] is then due to finite - size effects in the averaging process .",
    "theories of immiscible two - phase flow in porous media attempt to provide a set of equations describing the flow at the continuum scale while anchoring the key concepts at the pore level . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", there are several different theories in existence .",
    "there is the percolation - based approach @xcite , there is the approach based on continuum mixture theory where the interface energies play a major role @xcite , and there is the approach where additional variables describing the theormodynamics of the interfaces are introduced @xcite .",
    "the classical , and by far dominating theory in use today is relative permeability theory @xcite even though it is well known to have serious weaknesses .    the two equations ( [ eqn18 ] ) and ( [ eqn20 ] ) are based on general non - equilibrium thermodynamical arguments that only invoke scale symmetry ( [ eqn10 ] ) and a balance of dissipation and power",
    ", they must apply to all these theories . in the following ,",
    "we analyze relative permeability theory in light of our equations .",
    "the relative permability approach consists in making explicit assumptions about the functional form of @xmath33 and @xmath34 through the generalized darcy equations .",
    "returning to the rev and the definitions of section [ system ] , we have @xmath194 and @xmath195 here @xmath196 is the permeability of the porous medium , and @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the relative permeabilities of the wetting and non - wetting fluids .",
    "one distinguishes between the pressure gradient in the wetting fluid @xmath199 and in the non - wetting fluid @xmath200 .",
    "they are related through the capillary pressure @xmath201 by @xmath202    the assumptions concerning the physical properties of the flow made in the relative permeability description are that the relative permeabilities and the capillary pressure are functions of the wetting ( or equivalently , the non - wetting ) saturation _ only , _",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "these are strong assumptions , and there is growing evidence that they do not hold in general , see @xcite : the relative permeabilities and the capillary pressure are _ not _ functions of the saturation alone .",
    "let us now turn to the second fundamental equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) , combining it with the relative permeability and capillary pressure equations ( [ eqn7])([eqn9 ] ) . by inserting the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath34 in terms of the relative permeabilities , and eliminating @xmath206 by equation ( [ eqn9 ] ) ,",
    "we find @xmath207\\ \\delta p_n & \\nonumber\\\\ -\\left[\\frac{s_w}{\\mu_w}\\ \\left(\\frac{d}{ds_w}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{k_{r , w}}{s_w}\\ p_c\\right ) \\right]&=0\\;.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation must be valid for all values of @xmath208 .",
    "hence , it splits into two equations , @xmath209 and @xmath210 this latter equation may in turn be integrated to give @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a reference pressure .",
    "we see here that the fundamental assumptions of relative permeability concept are challenged : equation ( [ eqn32 ] ) _ contains the viscosities _ @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "hence , at least one of the relative permeabilities @xmath197 and @xmath198 _ must _ depend of the viscosity ratio @xmath213 .",
    "we also see from equation ( [ eqn34 ] ) that the capillary pressure @xmath201 _ can not become negative .",
    "_ however , under mixed wetting conditions , it does @xcite .",
    "there are equations relating the capillary pressure to the relative permeability in the literature such as the brooks - corey relation @xcite or the van genuchten equation @xcite .",
    "these equations all build on the work of purcell @xcite who generalized to pore networks the relation between the capillary pressure and the permeability of a single capillary tube via the young formula for interfacial tension .",
    "equation ( [ eqn34 ] ) is different from these earlier equations in that it does not rely on assumptions concerning the physics of the problem apart from the balance of dissipation in and work on the fluids .",
    "we also note that popular parametrizations of the relative permeabilities such as that of corey @xcite and that of lomeland et al .",
    "@xcite (  let \"- type ) do not obey equation ( [ eqn32 ] ) .",
    "hence , they are thermodynamically inconsistent , as are the basic assumption that the relative permeabilities @xmath214 and @xmath198 are functions of the saturation @xmath32  alone .",
    "we have in this paper constructed a theory based on non - equilibrium thermodynamics that reduces the immiscible _ two - phase flow _ in porous media to a _",
    "one - phase _ flow problem .",
    "let us now consider a three - dimensional isotropic porous medium .",
    "let @xmath215 be a point somewhere in this porous medium .",
    "the theory that we have developed can then be summarized by the following set of equations , @xmath216 @xmath217 and @xmath218 here ( [ conc-1 ] ) is the conservation law for the wetting saturation .",
    "this expression becomes the buckley - leverett equation @xcite if we set @xmath219 , see equation ( [ eqn21 ] ) and take the incompressibility of the fluids into account .",
    "the non - wetting saturation @xmath220 has been eliminated by using the incompressibility of the two fluids .",
    "this implies that @xmath221 is build into the equation set .",
    "equation ( [ conc-6 ] ) is the three - dimensional version of equation ( [ eqn20 ] ) .",
    "the three - dimensional version of equation ( [ eqn18 ] ) is @xmath222 .",
    "this equation follows by taking the derivative of ( [ conc-5 ] ) with respect to @xmath32 and using ( [ conc-6 ] ) .",
    "hence , this equation is also contained in ( [ conc-1 ] ) to ( [ conc-6 ] ) .",
    "it may replace either of the equations ( [ conc-5 ] ) or ( [ conc-6 ] ) .",
    "these equations are all conservation laws , the last two express power input equals dissipation .",
    "thus , they transcend the details of the porous medium .",
    "equations ( [ conc-1 ] ) to ( [ conc-6 ] ) are 7 equations .",
    "there are ten variables @xmath32 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "the three equations that close the system of equations are the _ constitutive equations _",
    "@xmath226\\;,\\ ] ] containing the detailed physics of the system .",
    "we see that the constitutive equation does not contain the seepage velocities of the immiscible fluids , @xmath224 and @xmath225 , explicitly .",
    "only the saturation @xmath32 enters .",
    "hence , the constitutive equation ( [ conc-7 ] ) can be interpreted as that of a single fluid depending on one extra variable , @xmath227 .",
    "hence , the equation set ( [ conc-1 ] )  ( [ conc-7 ] ) reduces the immiscible two - phase flow problem in porous media to a one - phase flow problem involving a complex fluid .",
    "this viewpoint permeates recent work on the effective permeability of immicible two - phase systems where it is suggested that two fluids behave as if they were a single bingham plastic @xcite .",
    "we may clarify this point even further by eliminating the two fluid velocities @xmath224 and @xmath225 in equations ( [ conc-1 ] ) to ( [ conc-6 ] ) .",
    "the equation set then reduces to a single equation @xmath228 together with the constitutive equation ( [ conc-7 ] ) , we now have a closed set describing effectively a single fluid with a velocity field @xmath223 which transports an active scalar @xmath32 .      in this manuscript",
    "we have considered a single driving force that induces the flow : the pressure gradient .",
    "other forces such as buoyancy , temperature gradients and chemical driving forces can be incorporated in the non - equil - ibrium thermodynamics formalism used in section [ diss ] .",
    "the same is true for the introduction of more immiscible fluids than two .",
    "hence , equations ( [ conc-1 ] ) to ( [ conc-6 ] ) may be generalized to include these additional complications .",
