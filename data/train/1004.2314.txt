    "teleportation is the faithful transfer of quantum states between spatially separated parties , based on the prior establishment of entanglement and a classical communication @xcite . as a practical application",
    ", teleportation has been implemented experimentally in several quantum systems @xcite , and could be very useful for achieving quantum repeaters @xcite , quantum networks kimble08 , and also quantum computing @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid on teleportation of multipartite states lee02,fang03,rigolin05yeo06muralidharan08 .",
    "it has been shown that an arbitrary two - qubit state can be teleported using the multipartite entangled state as quantum channel @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , cavity qed system gives a very nice platform to accomplish quantum teleportation .",
    "many schemes have been proposed in this system .",
    "the earlier schemes use the atom as a flying qubit to transfer quantum information liu04,zheng04cardoso05 , which are actually unsuitable for long - distance communication .",
    "furthermore , the schemes mentioned above work well only in high - q cavities , which are hard to accomplish with current technology . besides , most of those schemes , e.g. , @xcite , are intrinsically probabilistic .    can we achieve teleportation with low - q cavities ?",
    "more recently , schemes using photons to transfer information and atoms to store information were proposed @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on the detection of photons leaking out of cavities .",
    "taking the cavity damping into account , these schemes work in the low - q cavity regime .",
    "however , the cavity damping actually plays a detrimental role in the success probability of the teleportaion .",
    "thus these schemes are intrinsically probabilistic .",
    "it shows the strong dependence of the implementation on the dissipative rate .",
    "this implies a negligible possibility to achieve a teleportation with the low - q cavities .    in this work",
    ", however , we will show this possibility with a practical scheme to teleport multipartite states using sophisticated low - q cavities .",
    "inspired by recent experiments of photonic input - output process sherson06,dayan08 , the key idea is to make use of the faraday rotation produced by single - photon - pulse input and output process regarding low - q cavities .",
    "we had noticed a previous idea for teleportation using faraday rotation by single photons from microcavities at one location to those at another location in quantum dot system @xcite . while the photons input and output from the microcavities correspond to some decay effects , there was little discussion about the impact from dissipation on the teleportation . in our point of view",
    ", an efficient implementation of the teleportation in @xcite requires high rate of the photons input and output with respect to the cavities .",
    "this implies the necessity of employing bad cavities with large decay rates , which goes beyond the model there .",
    "the key point of our present scheme is to make use of a new reflection coefficient equation published recently @xcite , which enables us to get a rotation of the photonic polarization , named faraday rotation julsgaard01 , conditional on the atomic state confined in the cavity even in low - q regime .",
    "we argue that our scheme would be advantageous over previous schemes @xcite in accomplishment of the teleportation in a deterministic fashion with currently available cavity qed technology , such as the microtoroidal resonator @xcite or the single - sided optical cavity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the disentangling action of faraday rotation to the photonic and atomic state in the destination side , only product - state measurement is needed in our scheme , which much relaxes the experimental difficulty .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ fd ] , we first briefly review the input - output process of a single - photon pulse regarding a low - q cavity and show the faraday rotation of the photonic polarization @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sche ] we explicitly elucidate our teleportation scheme of multipartite state via faraday rotation .",
    "the discussion about the experimental feasibility of our scheme and a short conclusion are made in sec .",
    "we first briefly review the input - output relation in a low - q cavity discussed in @xcite . consider a bimodal cavity with one of the mirrors partially reflective so that the photon can be injected in and then reflected out with a certain probability , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sle ] ( a ) .",
    "the level structure of the atom confined in the cavity is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sle ] ( b ) , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspond to the degenerate zeeman sublevels of the ground state in an alkali atom , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are due to the coupling of the atom to the two degenerate cavity modes @xmath4 ( with left circular polarization ) and @xmath5 ( with right circular polarization ) , respectively .",
    "each of the transition channels is governed by the hamiltonian of usual jaynes - cummings model .",
    "suppose a l - ( or r - ) circularly polarized single - photon pulse with the frequency @xmath6 is input into the cavity .",
    "the pulse is denoted by @xmath7 is a time - dependent normalized pulse shape with the pulse duration @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the input photon operator satisfying the commutation relation @xmath10=\\delta(t - t^{\\prime } ) $ ] , and latexmath:[$%    atom is prepared in @xmath0 ( or in @xmath12 ) initially , then the photon will trigger the transition @xmath13 ( or @xmath14a(t)-g\\sigma _ { -}(t)-\\sqrt{\\kappa }",

    "@xmath17 is vacuum input field felt by the atom .",
    "the contribution of vacuum field @xmath17 is negligible because it is much less than the one of the photon pulse @xmath18 .",
    "the output field @xmath19 relates to the input field by the intracavity field as @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath21 is large enough to ensure the atom initially prepared in the ground state is only virtually excited by the photon , so we can take @xmath22 . also under this large @xmath21 limit",
    ", we can adiabatically eliminate the intracavity mode from the set of quantum langevin equations and arrive consequently at the input - output relation as @xmath23[i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { p})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2}}{[i(\\omega _ { c}-\\omega _ { p})+% \\frac{\\kappa } { 2}][i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { p})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2}}. \\label{r}\\]]where @xmath24 is the reflection coefficient of the photon to the atom - cavity system . on the other hand , if the atom is prepared in @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) initially under the condition that a l- ( or r- ) circularly polarized photon pulse is input in the cavity , then no transition would be triggered .",
    "in other words , the photon only feels an empty cavity , for which the input - output relation corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) with @xmath25 @xcite , i.e. @xmath26    the complex reflection coefficients ( [ r ] ) and ( [ r0 ] ) show that the reflected photon experiences an absorption as well as a phase shift denoted by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "however , under the practical experimental condition , i.e. , the strong @xmath21 and weak @xmath29 and @xmath16 @xcite , it has been verified that the absolute values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are only slightly deviated from unity @xcite .",
    "this implies that the photon experiences a very weak absorption , and thereby we may approximately consider that the output photon only experiences a pure phase shift without any absorption .    with this basic input - output relation , the faraday rotation can be derived readily when a linearly polarized photon is input into the cavity .",
    "consider the input pulse is linearly polarized in @xmath32 and the atom initially in @xmath0 , the output photon would have a rotation in the polarization .",
    "in this case , the latexmath:[$%    the atom from @xmath0 to @xmath34 , and thus experiences a phase shift @xmath35 obeying eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath36 component of the photon only feels an empty cavity , which yields a phase shift @xmath37 obeying eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) .",
    "so the output pulse is @xmath38 this also implies that the polarization direction of the reflected photon rotates an angle @xmath39 with respect to the input one , called faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "similarly , if the atom is initially prepared in @xmath1 , then only the r circularly polarized photon could sense the atom , while the l circularly polarized photon only feels the empty cavity .",
    "so we have @xmath40 corresponding to a faraday rotation with an angle @xmath41 .",
    "in what follows , we show the teleportation of a multipartite state by above faraday rotations . as plotted in fig . 1 ( c ) , to construct the entanglement between alice and bob",
    ", bob has to first input @xmath42 single - photon pulses into his cavities to produce @xmath42 pairs of entangled states between the photons and atoms using the faraday rotations of the photons .",
    "then the emitted photons fly to alice through the fiber .",
    "once alice collects the photons in her cavities , the entanglement between alice and bob has been established .",
    "we emphasize that the photon in our scheme acts dual roles : on the one hand , it acts as a bus to distribute entanglement ; on the other hand , it also acts as a component of the entangled pair to implement the teleportation .      to demonstrate our scheme",
    "specifically , we will take @xmath43 below as an example .",
    "suppose the quantum state to be teleported in alice s hands is @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are unknown parameters with @xmath49 . in the following we give explicitly the steps for accomplishing the quantum teleportation .",
    "_ the first step : establishment of the quantum channels .",
    "_ bob inputs two linearly polarized single - photon pulses in @xmath50 generated from the single - photon source into two cavities at his side .",
    "the states of the atoms confined in bob s cavities are initially @xmath51 .",
    "according to the input - output relation , the atoms and the photons are entangled due to the faraday rotation , @xmath52 .",
    "\\label{qch}\\ ] ] then after alice collects the two output photons via two fibers , two quantum channels are thus established .",
    "one can see that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orthogonal when @xmath55 .",
    "it means that under this condition , the quantum channel characterized by the right side of eq .",
    "( [ qch ] ) is maximally entangled . in practice",
    ", this condition can be easily satisfied experimentally . using the parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , we can verify from eqs .",
    "( [ r ] ) and ( [ r0 ] ) that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the faraday rotation under the same condition has been used to realize the universal quantum gate , the entanglement generation between remote atoms and its conversion to the flying photons in ref .",
    "@xcite .    _ the second step : realization of the bell - state measurement .",
    "_ in the standard protocol of quantum teleportaion , a necessary step is the bell - state measurement on the atom and one of the entangled pair of the quantum channel in alice s side @xcite .",
    "the measurement would collapse the state of the total system in one of its four superposition components .",
    "experimentally , this bell - state measurement is ordinarily realized by the cnot operation plus the product - state measurement . in the following",
    "we show the cnot operation can actually be replaced by the faraday rotation in alice s side , which much relaxes the experimental difficulty to do the cnot operation . after collecting the photons",
    ", alice feeds the photons to her cavities .",
    "the faraday rotation makes the two atoms at alice s hands entangled with the two quantum channels .",

    "our scheme , involving only virtual excitation of the atoms , is robust to spontaneous emission .",

    "( [ r ] ) , our scheme could work with bad cavities in the case of large cavity decay and/or weak couplings .",
    "the dominant source of error in our scheme is the photon loss due to the cavity mirror absorption and scattering , the fiber absorption , and the inefficiency of the detector .",
    "nevertheless , since the accomplishment of our scheme relies on the successful detection of the photons , the photon loss does not affect the fidelity , but only the efficiency .",
    "the hadamard gate operations on the atoms could be done using raman configuration by two polarized lasers detuned from the @xmath70 and latexmath:[$|1\\rangle\\leftrightarrow    states could be carried out by a resonant laser .",

    "fortunately , thanks to the highly efficient single - photon generator producing 10000 photons every second @xcite , we may accomplish the teleportation in finite time .",
    "for example , a successful teleportation of a two - qubit state takes about three hours .",
    "this time - consuming implementation is mainly resulted from the low efficiency of currently available single - photon detectors , which is also a problem in any of the previously published schemes using photon interference . to shorten the implementation time , on the one hand",

    "a simple estimate of the implementation time of our scheme is plotted in fig . [ time ] with respect to different imperfect factors .    in comparison to previous proposals for teleportation considering virtually excited cavity modes @xcite and cavity decay @xcite ,",
    "our scheme is advantageous to work very well not only in the case of the bad cavities , but also in perfect and deterministic fashion . using photons as flying qubits to transfer quantum information , it is more suitable for long - distance communication compared to the schemes in ref .",
