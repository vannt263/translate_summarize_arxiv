    "a vast number of astronomical observations suggests that magnetic fields play a crucial role in the dynamics of many phenonema of relativistic astrophyics , either on stellar scales , such as for pulsars , magnetars , compact x - ray binaries , short and long / gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and possibly for the collapse of massive stellar cores , but also on much larger scales , as it is the case for radio galaxies , quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "a shared aspect in all these phenomena is that the plasma is essentially electrically neutral and the frequency of collisions is much larger than the inverse of the typical timescale of the system .",
    "the mhd approximation is then an excellent description of the global properties of these plasmas and has been employed with success over the several decades to describe the dynamics of such systems well in their nonlinear regimes .",
    "another important common aspect in these systems is that their flows are characterized by large magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the typical sizes and velocities , respectively , while @xmath3 is the magnetic diffusivity and @xmath4 is the electrical conductivity . for a typical relativistic compact object , @xmath5 and , under these conditions , the magnetic field is essentially advected with the flow , being continuosly distorted and possibly amplified , but also essentially not decaying .",
    "we note that these conditions are very different from those traditionally produced in the earth s laboratories , where @xmath6 , and the resistive diffusion represents an important feature of the magnetic - field evolution .",
    "a particularly simple and yet useful limit of the mhd approximation is that of the _ `` ideal - mhd '' _ limit .",
    "this is mathematically defined as the limit in which the electrical resistivity @xmath7 vanishes or , equivalently , by an infinite electrical conductivity .",
    "it is within this framework that many multi - dimensional numerical codes have been developed over the last decade to study a number of phenomena in relativistic astrophysics and in fully nonlinear regimes @xcite .",
    "the ideal - mhd approximation is not only a convenient way of writing and solving the equations of relativistic mhd , but it is also an excellent approximation for any process that takes place over a dynamical timescale . in the case of an old and `` cold '' neutron star , for example , the electrical and thermal transport properties of the matter are mainly determined by the transport properties of the electrons , which are the most important carriers of charge and heat . at temperatures above the crystallization temperature of the ions , the electrical ( and thermal ) conductivities",
    "are governed by electron scattering off ions and an approximate expression for the electrical conductivity is given by  @xcite @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the stellar temperature and mass density g @xmath11 and temperatures in the range @xmath12 k , but provides a reasonable estimate also at larger temperatures of @xmath13 k [ _ cf .",
    "@xcite ] . ] . even for a magnetic field that varies on a length - scale as small as @xmath14 , ( where @xmath15 is the stellar radius )",
    "the magnetic diffusion timescale is @xmath16 .",
    "clearly , at these temperatures and densities , ohmic diffusion will be neglible for any process taking place on a dynamical timescale for the star , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath17 , and thus the conductivity can be considered as essentially infinite .",
    "however , catastrophic events , such as the merger of two neutron stars , or of a neutron star with a black hole , can produce plasmas with regions at much larger temperatures ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xmath18 ) and much lower densities ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xmath19 .",
    "in such regimes , all the transport properties of the matter will be considerably modified and non - ideal effects , absent in perfect - fluid hydrodynamics ( such as bulk viscosity ) and ideal mhd ( such as ohmic diffusion on a much shorter timescale @xmath20 ) will need to be taken into account .",
    "similar conditions are likely not limited to binary mergers but , for instance , be present also behind processes leading to long grbs , thus extending the range of phenomena for which resistive effects could be important .",
    "note also that these non - ideal effects in hydrodynamics ( mhd ) are proportional not only to the viscosity ( resistivity ) of the plasma , but also to the second derivatives of the velocity ( magnetic ) fields .",
    "hence , even in the presence of a small viscosity ( resistivity ) , their contribution to the overall conservation of energy and momentum can be considerable if the velocity ( magnetic ) fields undergo very rapid spatial variations in the flow .",
    "a classical example of the importance of resistive mhd effects in plasmas with high but finite conductivities is offered by _",
    "current sheets_. these phenomena are often observed in the solar activity and are responsible for the reconnection of magnetic field lines and changes in the magnetic field topology . while these phenomena are behind the emission of large amounts of energy , they are strictly forbidden within the ideal - mhd limit due to magnetic flux conservation and so",
    "can not be studied employing this limit .    besides having considerably smaller conductivities , low - density higly magnetized plasmas are present rather generically around magnetized objects , constituting what is referred to as the `` magnetosphere '' . in such regions",
    "magnetic stresses are much larger than magnetic pressure gradients and can not be properly balanced ; as a result , the magnetic fields have to adjust themselves so that the magnetic stresses vanish identically .",
    "this scenario is known as the _ force free _ regime ( because the lorentz force vanishes in this case ) and while the equations governing it can be seen as the low - inertia limit of the ideal - mhd equations  @xcite , the force - free limit is really distinct from the ideal - mhd one .",
    "this represents a considerable complication since it implies that it is usually not possible to decribe , within the same set of equations , both the interior of compact objects and their magnetospheres .",
    "theoretical work to derive a fully relativistic theory of non - ideal hydrodynamics and non - ideal mhd has been carried out by several authors in the past @xcite and is particularly simple in the case of the resistive mhd description .",
    "the purpose of this work is indeed that of proposing the solution of the relativistic resistive mhd equations as an important step towards a more realistic modelling of astrophysical plasmas .",
    "there are a number of advantages behind such a choice .",
    "first , it allows one to use a single mathematical framework to describe both regions where the conductivity is large ( as in the interior of compact objects ) and small ( as in magnetospheres ) , and even the vacuum regions outside the compact objects where the mhd equations trivially reduce to the maxwell equations .",
    "second , it makes it possible to account self - consistently for those resistive effects , such as current sheets , which are energetically important and could provide a substantial modification of the whole dynamics .",
    "last but not least , the numerical solution of the resistive mhd equations provides the only way to control and distinguish the physical resistivity from the numerical one .",
    "the latter , which is inevitably present and proportional to truncation error , is also completely dependent on the specific details of the numerical algorithm employed and on the resolution used for the solution .",
    "as noted already by several authors , the numerical solution of the ideal - mhd equations is considerably less challenging than that of the resistive mhd equations . in this latter case , in fact ,",
    "the equations become mixed hyperbolic - parabolic in newtonian physics or hyperbolic with stiff relaxation terms in special relativity .",
    "the presence of stiff terms is the natural consequence of the fact that the diffusive effects take place on timescales that are intrinsically larger than the dynamical one",
    ". stated differently , in such equations the relaxation terms can dominate over the purely hyperbolic ones , posing severe constraints on the timestep for the evolution .",
    "while considerable work has already been made to introduce numerical techniques to achieve efficient implementations in either regime  @xcite , the use of these techniques in fully three - dimensional simulations is still difficult and expensive .    in order to benefit from the many advantages discussed above in the use of the resistive mhd equations , we here present a novel approach for the solution of the relativistic resistive mhd equations exploiting the properties of implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge kutta methods .",
    "this approach represents a simple but effective solution to the problem of the vastly different timescales without sacrificing either simplicity in the implementation or the numerical efficiency . by examining a number of tests",
    "we illustrate the accuracy of our approach under a variety of conditions and demonstrate its robustness . in addition",
    ", we also compare it with the alternative method proposed by  @xcite for the solution of the same set of relativistic resistive mhd equations .",
    "this latter approach employs strang - splitting techniques and the analytical integration of a reduced form of ampere s law . while it works well in a number of cases , it has revealed to be unstable when applied to discontinuous flows with large conductivities ;",
    "such difficulties were not encountered when solving the same problem within the imex implementation .    because our approach effectively treats within a unified framework both those regions of the flow which are fluid - pressure dominated and those which are instead magnetic - pressure dominated , it could find a number of applications and serve as a first step towards a more realistic modeling of relativistic astrophysical plasmas .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section2 ] we present the system of equations describing a resistive magnetized fluid , while in section [ section3 ] we discuss the problems related to the numerical evolution of this system of equations and the numerical approaches developed to solve them . in particular , we introduce the basic features of the imex runge - kutta schemes and recall their stability properties . in sect  [ section4 ] we instead explain in detail the implementation of the imex scheme to the resistive mhd equations . finally , in sect .",
    "[ section5 ] we present the numerical tests carried out either in one or two dimensions and that span several prescriptions for the conductivity .",
    "section [ section5 ] is also dedicated to the comparison with the strang - splitting technique .",
    "the conclusions and the perspectives for future improvements are presented in sect .",
    "[ section6 ] , while appendix  [ appendixb ] reviews our space discretization of the equations .    hereafter we will adopt gaussian units such that @xmath21 and employ the summation convention on repeated indices .",
    "roman indices @xmath22 are used to denote spacetime components ( _ i.e. _ ,  from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ) , while @xmath25 are used to denote spatial ones ; lastly , bold italics letters represent vectors , while bold letters represent tensors .",
    "an effective description of a fluid in the presence of electromagnetic fields can be made by considering three different sets of equations governing respectively the electromagnetic fields , the fluid variables and the coupling between the two .",
    "in particular , the electromagnetic part can be described via the maxwell equations , while the conservation of energy and momentum can be used to express the evolution of the fluid variables .",
    "finally , ohm s law , whose exact form depends on the microscopic properties of the fluid , expresses the coupling between the electromagnetic fields and the fluid variables . in what follows",
    "we review these three sets of equations separately , discuss how they then lead to the resistive mhd description , and how the latter reduces to the well - known limits of ideal - mhd and of the maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "our presentation will be focussed on the special - relativistic regime , but the extension to general relativity is rather straightforward and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the special relativistic maxwell equations can be written as  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the maxwell and the faraday tensor respectively and @xmath29 is the electric current 4-vector .",
    "a highly - ionized plasma has essentially zero electric and magnetic susceptibilities and the faraday tensor is then simply the dual of the maxwell tensor .",
    "this tensor provides information about the electric and magnetic fields measured by an observer moving along any timelike vector @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 we are considering @xmath30 to be the time - like traslational killing vector field in a flat ( minkowski ) spacetime , so @xmath32 and the levi - civita symbol @xmath33 is non - zero only for spatial indices .",
    "note that the electromagnetic fields have no components parallel to @xmath30 ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath34 ) .    by using the decomposition of the maxwell tensor ( [ maxwell_tensor ] ) ,",
    "the equations ( [ maxwell_covariant1])([maxwell_covariant2 ] ) can be split into directions which are parallel and orthogonal to @xmath30 to yield the familiar maxwell equations @xmath35 where we have decomposed also the current vector @xmath36 , with @xmath37 being the charge density , @xmath38 the convective current and @xmath39 the conduction current satisfying @xmath40 .",
    "the current conservation equation @xmath41 follows from the antisymmetry of the maxwell tensor and provides the evolution of the charge density @xmath37 @xmath42 which can be obtained also directly by taking the divergence of ( [ maxwell_clasic3 ] ) when the constraints ( [ maxwell_clasic1])([maxwell_clasic2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the evolution of the matter follows from the conservation of the stress - energy tensor @xmath43 and the conservation of baryon number @xmath44 where @xmath10 is the rest - mass density ( as measured in the rest frame of the fluid ) and @xmath45 is the fluid 4-velocity .",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath46 describing a perfect fluid minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field is given by the superposition @xmath47 where @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the enthalpy , with @xmath50 the pressure and @xmath51 the specific internal energy .",
    "the conservation law ( [ conservation_tmunu ] ) can be split into directions parallel and orthogonal to @xmath30 to yield the familiar energy and momentum conservation laws @xmath52 where we have introduced the conserved quantities @xmath53 , which are essentially the energy density @xmath54and the energy flux density @xmath55 , and whose expressions are given by @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the velocity measured by the inertial observer and @xmath58 is the lorentz factor .",
    "the fluxes can then be written as @xmath59 { \\bf g } \\ , .",
    "\\label{def_fs } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the conservation of the baryon number ( [ conservation_baryons ] ) reduces to the continuity equation written as @xmath60 where we have introduced another conserved quantity @xmath61 and its flux @xmath62 .      as mentioned above ,",
    "maxwell equations are coupled to the fluid ones by means of the current 4-vector @xmath63 , whose explicit form will depend in general on the electromagnetic fields and on the local fluid properties .",
    "a standard prescription is to consider the current to be proportional to the lorentz force acting on a charged particle and the electrical resistivity @xmath64 to be a scalar function .",
    "ohm s law , written in a lorentz invariant way , then reads @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the electrical conductivity of the medium . expressing ( [ ohm_relativistic_covariant ] ) in terms of the electric and magnetic fields one obtains the familiar form of ohm s law in a general inertial frame @xmath67 + q~{\\boldsymbol v } \\ , .\\ ] ] note that the conservation of the electric charge ( [ current_conservation_clasic ] ) provides the evolution equation for the charge density @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ ,  the projection of the 4-current @xmath68 along the direction @xmath69 ) , while ohm s law provides a prescription for the ( spatial ) conduction current @xmath70 ( _ i.e. _ ,  the components of @xmath71 orthogonal to @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is important to recall that in deriving expression  ( [ ohm_relativistic ] ) for ohm s law we are implicitly assuming that the collision frequency of the constituent particles of our fluid is much larger that the typical oscillation frequency of the plasma .",
    "stated differently , the timescale for the electrons and ions to come into equilibrium is much shorter than any other timescale in the problem , so that no charge separation is possible and the fluid is globally neutral .",
    "this assumption is a key aspect of the mhd approximation .",
    "the well - known ideal - mhd limit of ohm s law can be obtained by requiring the current to be finite even in the limit of infinite conductivity ( @xmath72 ) . in this limit ohm s law ( [ ohm_relativistic ] )",
    "then reduces to @xmath73 projecting this equation along @xmath57 one finds that the electric field does not have a component along that direction and then from the rest of the equation one recovers the well - known ideal - mhd condition @xmath74 stating that in this limit the electric field is orthogonal to both @xmath75 and @xmath57 .",
    "such a condition also expresses the fact that in ideal mhd the electric field is not an independent variable since it can be be computed via a simple algebraic relation from the velocity and magnetic vector fields .",
    "summarizing : the system of equations of the relativistic resistive mhd approximation is given by the constraint equations ( [ maxwell_clasic1])([maxwell_clasic2 ] ) , evolution equations ( [ maxwell_clasic3])([current_conservation_clasic ] ) , ( [ fluid_tau])([fluid_s ] ) and ( [ fluid_baryons ] ) , where the fluxes are given by eqs .  ( [ def_fe])([def_fs ] ) and the 3-current is given by ohm s law ( [ ohm_relativistic ] ) .",
    "these equations , together with a equation of state ( eos ) for the fluid and a reasonable model for the conductivity , completely describe the system under consideration provided consistent initial and boundary data are defined .",
    "at this point it is useful to point out some properties of the relativistic resistive mhd equations discussed so far , to underline their purely hyperbolic character and to contrast them with those of other forms of the resistive mhd equations which contain a parabolic part instead . to do this within a simple example",

    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath80 , equation ( [ relativistic_rmhd ] ) reduces to the familiar parabolic equation for the magnetic field @xmath81 where the last term is responsible for the diffusion of the magnetic field .",
    "it is important to stress the significant difference in the characteristic structure between equations ( [ relativistic_rmhd ] ) and ( [ newtonian_rmhd ] ) .",
    "both equations reduce to the same advection equation in the ideal - mhd limit of infinite conductivity ( @xmath82 ) indicating the flux - freezing condition .",
    "however , in the opposite limit of infinite resistivity ( @xmath83 ) eq .  ( [ newtonian_rmhd ] ) tends to the ( physically incorrect ) elliptic laplace equation @xmath84 while eq .  ( [ relativistic_rmhd ] )",
    "reduces to the ( physically correct ) hyperbolic wave equation for the magnetic field .",
    "the set of maxwell equations described above can also be cast in an extended fashion which includes two additional fields , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , introduced to control dynamically the constraints of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  eqs   ( [ maxwell_clasic1 ] ) and ( [ maxwell_clasic2 ] ) .",
    "this _ `` augmented '' _ system reads @xmath87 clearly , the standard maxwell equations ( [ maxwell_covariant1])([maxwell_covariant2 ] ) are recovered when @xmath88 and we are in this way extending the space of solutions of the original maxwell equations to include those with non - vanishing @xmath89 .",
    "the evolution of these extra scalar fields can be obtained by taking a partial derivative @xmath90 of the augmented maxwell equations ( [ maxwell_augmented1])([maxwell_augmented2 ] ) and using the antisymmetry of the maxwell and faraday tensors together with the conservation of charge to obtain @xmath91 it is evident that these represent wave equations with sources for the scalar fields @xmath89 , which propagate at the speed of light while being damped if @xmath92 . in particular , for any positive @xmath93 , they decay exponentially over a timescale @xmath94 to the trivial solution @xmath88 and the augmented system then reduces to the standard maxwell equations , including the constraints ( [ maxwell_clasic1 ] ) and ( [ maxwell_clasic2 ] ) .",
    "this approach , named hyperbolic divergence cleaning in the context of ideal mhd  @xcite , was proposed as a simple way of solving the maxwell equations and enforcing the conservation of the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field .    adopting this approach and following the formulation proposed by  @xcite , the evolution equations of the augmented maxwell equations ( [ maxwell_augmented1])([maxwell_augmented2 ] ) can then be written as @xmath95 the system of equations ( [ maxwell_aug1])([maxwell_aug4 ] ) , together with the current conservation ( [ current_conservation_clasic ] ) , is the one we will use for the numerical evolution of the electromagnetic fields within the set of relativistic resistive mhd equations .",
    "while the ideal - mhd equations are well suited to an efficient numerical implementation , the general system of relativistic resistive mhd equations brings about a delicate issue when the conductivity in the plasma undergoes very large spatial variations . in the regions with high conductivity ,",
    "in fact , the system will evolve on timescales which are very different from those in the low - conductivity region .",
    "mathematically , therefore , the problem can be regarded as a hyperbolic one with stiff relaxation terms which requires special care to capture the dynamics in a stable and accurate manner . in the next section",
    "we discuss a simple example of a hyperbolic equation with relaxation which exhibits the problems discussed above and then introduce implicit - explicit ( imex ) runge kutta methods to deal with these kind of equations .",
    "in essence , these methods treat the advection character of the system with strong - stability preserving ( ssp ) explicit schemes , while the relaxation character with an l - stable diagonally implicit runge kutta ( dirk ) scheme . after presenting the scheme , its properties and some examples ,",
    "we discuss in detail its application to the resistive mhd equations .",
    "a prototypical hyperbolic equation with relaxation is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the _ relaxation time _",
    "( not necessarily constant either in space or in time ) , @xmath98 gives rise to a quasilinear system of equations ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath98 depends linearly on first derivatives of @xmath99 ) , and @xmath15 does not contain derivatives of @xmath99 .    in the limit @xmath100 ( corresponding for the resistive mhd equations to the case of vanishing conductivity ) the system is hyperbolic with propagation speeds bounded by @xmath101 .",
    "this maximum bound , together with the length scale @xmath1 of the system , define a characteristic timescale @xmath102 of the hyperbolic part . in the opposite limit @xmath103 ( corresponding to the case of infinite conductivity ) ,",
    "the system is instead said to be _ stiff _ , since the timescale @xmath51 of the relaxation ( or stiff ) term @xmath104 is in general much larger than the timescale @xmath105 of the hyperbolic part @xmath98 .",
    "in such a limit , the stability of an explicit scheme is only achieved with a timestep size @xmath106 .",
    "this requirement is certainly more restrictive than the courant - lewy - friedrichs ( cfl ) stability condition @xmath107 for the hyperbolic part and makes an explicit integration impractical .",
    "the development of efficient numerical schemes for such systems is challenging , since in many applications the relaxation time can vary by several orders of magnitude across the computational domain and , more importantly , to much beyond the one determined by the speed @xmath101 .    when faced with this issue",
    "several strategies can be adopted .",
    "the most straightforward one is to consider only the stiff limit @xmath108 , where the system is well approximated by a suitable reduced set of conservation laws called _ `` equilibrium system '' _ @xcite such that @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a reduced set of variables .",
    "this approach can be followed if the resulting system is also hyperbolic .",
    "this is precisely the case in the resistive mhd equations for vanishing resistivity @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 ) . in this case",
    ", the equations reduce to those of ideal mhd and describe indeed an `` equilibrium system '' in which the magnetic field is simply advected with the flow . as discussed earlier , this limit is often adequate to describe the behaviour of dense astrophysical plasmas , but it may also stray away in the magnetospheres",
    ". a more general approach could consist of dividing the computational domain in regions in each of which a simplified set of equations can be adopted . as an example , the ideal - mhd equations could be solved in the interior of compact objects , the force - free mhd equations could be solved in the magnetosphere , and finally the maxwell equations for the vacuum regions outside the compact object .",
    "however , this approach requires the overall scheme to suitably match the different regions so as to obtain a global solution .",
    "this task , unfortunately , is far from being straightforward and , to date , it lacks a rigorous definition .",
    "an alternative approach consists of considering the original hyperbolic - relaxation system in the whole computational domain and then employ suitable numerical schemes that work for all regions . among such schemes is the strang - splitting technique  @xcite , which has been recently applied by  @xcite for the solution of the ( special ) relativistic resistive mhd equations .",
    "the strang - splitting scheme provides second - order accuracy if each step is at least second - order accurate , and this property is maintained under suitable assumptions even for stiff problems  @xcite . in practice , however , higher - order accuracy is difficult to obtain even in non - stiff regimes with this kind of splitting . moreover , when applied to hyperbolic systems with relaxation , strang - splitting schemes reduce to first - order accuracy since the kernel of the relaxation operator is non - trivial and corresponds to a singular matrix in the linear case , therefore invalidating the assumptions made by  @xcite to ensure high - order accuracy .",
    "@xcite avoided this problem by solving analytically the stiff part in a reduced form of ampere s law .",
    "although this procedure works well for smooth solutions , our implementation of the method has revealed problems when evolving discontinuous flows ( shocks ) for large - conductivities plasmas .",
    "moreover , it is unclear whether the same procedure can be adopted in more general configurations , where an analytical solution may not be available .    as an alternative approach to the methods solving the relativistic resistive mhd equations on a single computational domain",
    ", we here introduce an imex runge - kutta method @xcite to cope with the stiffness problems discussed above .",
    "these methods , which are easily implemented , are still under development and have few ( relatively minor ) drawbacks .",
    "the most serious one is a degradation to first or second - order accuracy for a range of values of the relaxation time @xmath51 .",
    "however , since high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) schemes usually employed for the solution of the hydrodynamic equations already suffer from similar effects at discontinuities , the possible degradation of the imex schemes does not spoil the overall quality numerical solution when employed in conjunction with hrsc schemes .",
    "the next sections review in some detail the imex schemes and our specific implementation for the relativistic resistive mhd equations .",
    "the imex runge - kutta schemes rely on the application of an implicit discretization scheme to the stiff terms and of an explicit one to the non - stiff ones . when applied to system ( [ stiff_equation ] )",
    "it takes the form @xcite @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the auxiliary intermediate values of the runge - kutta scheme .",
    "the matrices @xmath115 and @xmath116 are @xmath117 matrices such that the resulting scheme is explicit in @xmath118 ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath119 for @xmath120 ) and implicit in @xmath15 .",
    "an imex runge - kutta scheme is characterized by these two matrices and the coefficient vectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 . since simplicity and efficiency in solving",
    "the implicit part at each step is important , it is natural to consider diagonally implicit runge - kutta ( dirk ) schemes ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath123 for @xmath124 ) for the stiff terms .",
    "a particularly convenient way of describing an imex runge - kutta scheme is offered by the butcher notation , in which the scheme is by a double tableau of the type  @xcite @xmath125 where the index @xmath9 indicates a transpose and where the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 used for the treatment of non - autonomous systems are given by @xmath128 the accuracy of each of the runge - kutta is achieved by imposing restrictions in some of the coefficients of their respective butcher tableaus .",
    "although each of them separately can have an arbitrary accuracy , this does not ensure that the combination of the two schemes will preserve the same accuracy .",
    "in addition to the above conditions for each runge - kutta scheme , there are also some additional conditions combining terms in the two tableaus which must be fulfilled in order to achieve a global accuracy order for the complete imex scheme .    since the details of these methods are not widely known , we first consider a simple example to fix ideas .",
    "a second - order imex scheme can be written in the tableau form given in table [ ssp2 - 222 ] .",

    "because of the stability properties of the imex schemes  @xcite , it follows that if the explicit part of the imex scheme is ssp , then the method is ssp for the equilibrium system in the stiff limit .",

    "we have solved this problem by using extra iterations in our 1d newton - raphson solver , but a multidimensional solver is necessary for a more robust and efficient implementation of the inversion process .    with this numerical implementation we have carried out a number of numerical tests aimed at assessing the robustness and accuracy of the approach , also when compared to other equivalents ones , such as the strang - splitting method recently proposed by  @xcite .",
    "all of the tests performed have shown the effectiveness of our approach in solving the relativistic resistive mhd equations in situations involving both small and large uniform conductivities , as well as conductivities that are allowed to vary nonlinearly across the plasma .",
    "furthermore , when compared with the strang - splitting technique , the imex approach has not shown any of the instability problems that affect the strang - splitting approach for flows with discontinuities and large conductivities .    while the results presented here open promising perspectives for the implementation of imex schemes in the modelling of relativistic compact objects , at least two further improvements can be made with minor efforts .",
    "the first one consists of the generalization of the ( special ) relativistic resistive mhd equations with a scalar isotropic ohm s law to the general relativistic case , and its application to compact astrophysical bodies such a magnetized binary neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the resistive mhd equations can yield different results not only in the dynamics of the magnetosphere produced after the merger , but also provide the possibility to predict , at least in some approximation , the electromagnetic radiation produced by the merger of these objects .",
    "the second improvement consists of considering a non - scalar and anisotropic ohm s law , so that the behaviour of the currents in the magnetosphere can be described by using a very high conductivity along the magnetic lines and a negligibly small one in the transverse directions  @xcite .",
    "such an improvement may serve as a first step towards an alternative modelling of force - free plasmas .",
    "we would like to thank eric hirschmann , serguei komissarov , steve liebling , jonathan mckinney , david neilsen and olindo zanotti for useful comments and bruno giacomazzo for comments and for providing the code computing the exact solution of the riemann problem in ideal mhd .",
    "ll and cp would like to thank famaf ( unc ) for hospitality .",
    "cp is also grateful to lorenzo pareschi for the many clarifications about the imex schemes .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grants phy-0326311 , phy-0653369 and phy-0653375 to louisiana state university , the dfg grant sfb / transregio  7 , conicet and secyt - unc .",
    "we are generically interested in solving hyperbolic conservation laws of the form @xmath322 where @xmath172 is the vector of the evolved fields , @xmath323 are their fluxes and @xmath324 contains the sources terms . the semi - discrete version of this equation , in one dimension , is simply given by @xmath325 where @xmath326 are consistent numerical fluxes evaluated at the interfaces between numerical cells .",
    "these consistent fluxes are computed by using hrsc methods , which are based on the use of riemann solvers .",
    "more specifically , we have implemented a modification of the local lax - friedrichs approximate riemann solver introduced by  @xcite , which only needs the spectral radius ( _ i.e. _ ,  the maximum eigenvalue ) of the system . in highly relativistic cases , like the ones we are interested in ,",
    "the spectral radius is close to the light speed @xmath21 and so the local lax - friedrichs reduces to the simpler lax - friedrichs flux @xmath327\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath328 are the reconstructed solutions on the left and on the right of the interface and @xmath329 their corresponding fluxes .",
    "the standard procedure is then to reconstruct the solution @xmath328 by interpolating with a polynomial and then compute the fluxes @xmath330 and @xmath331 . in our implementation",
    "we first recombine the fluxes and the solution as  @xcite @xmath332 then , using a piecewise linear reconstruction , these combinations can be computed on the left / right of the interface as @xmath333 where @xmath334 are just the slopes used to extrapolate @xmath335 to the interfaces . finally , the consistent flux is computed by a simple average @xmath336\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a linear reconstruction the slopes can be written as @xmath337 so that it is trivial to check that the standard lax - friedrichs ( [ lax - friedrichs ] ) is recovered when @xmath338 .",
    "the choice of these slopes becomes crucial in the presence of shocks or very sharp profiles , while the use of some nonlinear operators @xmath339 preserves the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) condition on the interpolating polynomial . in this way",
    ", the tvd schemes capture accurately the dynamics of strong shocks without the oscillations which appear with standard finite - difference discretizations .",
    "monotonicity is typically enforced by making use of slope limiters and we have in particular implemented the monotonized centered ( mc ) limiter @xmath340 ~{\\rm       min}(2|x|,2|y|,\\frac{1}{2}|x+y| ) \\,,\\ ] ] which provides a good compromise between robustness and accuracy . note that with linear reconstruction the scheme is second - order accurate in the smooth regions , although it drops to first order near shocks and at local extrema ."
