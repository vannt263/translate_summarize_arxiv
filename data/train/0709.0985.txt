    "<S> firstly , the experiments worked with low atom number , with typically several thousand atoms in the condensate . secondly , the experiments employed a feshbach resonance to control the s - wave scattering length and , indeed , this allowed the use of a low attractive scattering length of the order of @xmath116 nm . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in principle similar experiments could probe high fidelity parameter space of @xmath117 and @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath118 and @xmath107 nm , and realistic parameters for our trapping system : @xmath119hz , @xmath112 m , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 m . </S>",
    "<S> initially we consider the condensate dynamics under the counter - intuitive protocol and for a pulse time of @xmath123s and a pulse delay of @xmath124s . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) as chronological frames of an isosurface of the bec density and in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) as a carpet plot of the radially - integrated axial density . for these realistic parameters we clearly see efficient twt , i.e. the @xmath125 @xmath0li atoms </S>",
    "<S> are adiabatically transported a distance of approximately @xmath126 m with negligible occupation of well 2 . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the timescale for this process is just under @xmath23s , which is the lifetime of such condensates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results have a fidelity @xmath127 , which is limited by the maximum occupation of well 2 during the transfer . </S>",
    "<S> up until now we have defined well 2 as the spatial region @xmath128 $ ] for simplicity . however , it may be more appropriate to define well 2 as the classically - allowed region , i.e. the region between @xmath129 and @xmath130 where the chemical potential of the initial state is less than @xmath69 . under this definition </S>",
    "<S> we find that the maximum atom number at any given time that occupies the classically - allowed region is less than @xmath4 of @xmath22 , giving a fidelity of @xmath131 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also simulated the dynamics of this system for the _ intuitive _ protocol . recall that this corresponds to when the first barrier is pulsed before the second barrier . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) , which shows the evolution of the radially - integrated axial density . under this protocol </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see the macroscopic occupation of well 2 during the transfer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , at a single time during these dynamics over @xmath132 of the atoms reside in the classically allowed region in well 2 , two orders of magnitude larger than for the counter - intuitive protocol . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that a straightforward experimental confirmation of twt is to reverse the pulses and compare the condensate density in the middle well half way through the pulse sequence .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel protocol for the transport of becs in three - well systems . </S>",
    "<S> this protocol enables the adiabatic transport a macroscopic bec such that the transient occupation of the intermediate well is heavily suppressed : transport without transit . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that this works within both a three - mode approach and a meanfield approximation , where all of the modes of the mean - field system are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we have mapped out the parameter space for which we expect transport without transit to occur . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we have demonstrated the transport - without - transit of an interacting bec of @xmath125 @xmath0li atoms a macroscopic distance of @xmath133 m over a timescale of @xmath134s . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is not only of interest from the view point of testing the _ wave _ nature of a dilute gas bose - einstein condensate , but also paves the way for a new method of control in atom optical devices . </S>",
    "<S> future extensions to this work include the examination of non - meanfield effects , such as quantum fluctuations @xcite , and the consideration for systems with more than three wells @xcite .    </S>",
