    "the problem of determining of the mass spectrum of bound states for qcd is not completely solved yet .",
    "the fact that the coupling constant is not small at low energies motivates the development of nonperturbative calculation methods .",
    "one of such methods is the canonical quantization theory in the light front ( lf ) coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is time@xcite .",
    "a canonical lf hamiltonian is constructed as a result of the quantization .",
    "afterwards , the calculation of its spectrum has to be performed .",
    "the advantage of this approach is a simple form of the vacuum state : the physical vacuum coincides with the mathematical vacuum .",
    "this fact simplifies the calculation of the mass spectrum of bound states ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however it is necessary to note , that it is strictly correct only when an appropriate regularization is introduced .",
    "the method of quantization in lf coordinates was described in detail in the review ref .",
    "also we can note the recent works@xcite which use this method .",
    "unfortunately , the quantization in lf coordinates may lead to the theory which is not equivalent to the original theory in lorentz coordinates@xcite .",
    "this is due to appearance of the singularity of the theory at light - like momentum @xmath4 , equal zero .",
    "regularization of this singularity leads to broken lorentz invariance .",
    "however , it is possible to recover equivalence of two approaches , at least in all orders of the coupling constant perturbation theory , correcting `` naive '' lf hamiltonian by addition of certain counterterms .",
    "this , `` corrected '' , lf hamiltonian can be used for nonperturbative calculations .",
    "the general method of finding a `` corrected '' lf hamiltonian by analyzing of the feynman perturbation theory in all orders is given in ref .",
    "an example of successful application of this method together with numerical calculation of the spectrum of hamiltonian in the `` discretized light - cone quantization '' ( dlcq , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) method is the investigation of a 2d model , the massive schwinger model@xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum calculated nonperturbatively with the `` corrected '' lf hamiltonian , was in good agreement with the results of lattice calculations using usual coordinates for a wide range of fermion mass . at the same time , the use of `` naive '' lf hamiltonian gives correct results only for small masses of a fermion@xcite .",
    "construction of the `` corrected '' lf hamiltonian for the 4d nonabelian gauge theory , in particular for qcd , is a very difficult problem .",
    "such a qcd hamiltonian is constructed in the article ref .",
    "@xcite , but the gauge invariance in this construction is broken . as a result",
    ", renormalization leads to a large number of counterterms with unknown coefficients .",
    "it should be noted that unlike 2d models ( where the space of the states is found to be finite - dimensional in the framework of dlcq method , see e.  g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for 4d theory , space of states is not finite - dimensional , because there are additional directions @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to calculate the mass spectrum of lf hamiltonian .",
    "these two problems , the violation of gauge invariance and the infinite dimension of the space of states , can be solved at once if the transverse lattice @xmath5 is introduced .",
    "the usual way of the introduction of the lattice is when the components of the gauge field in the discrete directions are replaced by unitary matrices related to the links of the lattice .",
    "unitarity of these matrices makes action of the theory non - polynomial relatively to independent variables .",
    "this makes analysis of feynman perturbation theory extremely difficult .",
    "therefore , it seems more promising to consider these matrices as arbitrary complex ( see review ref .",
    "@xcite for applying this idea to 4d lattice ) and use a transverse lattice method as it is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach , action is polynomial and analysis of the perturbation theory is more simple , however , non - physical degrees of freedom appear in the theory .    in order to apply the method of",
    "`` corrected ''",
    "lf hamiltonian to the theory on the transverse lattice , feynman perturbation theory on the transverse lattice should be formulated .",
    "furthermore , an action should be selected in such a way that the green functions of the theory in lorentz coordinates coincide with the green functions of the normal qcd in the zero limit of lattice spacing @xmath6 and the non - physical degrees of freedom are switched off from the theory .",
    "it is necessary also to perform the procedure of renormalization of the theory with the lattice regularization being removed .",
    "after that a `` corrected ''",
    "lf hamiltonian can be constructed by the method from ref .",
    "this hamiltonian would correspond to the normal qcd at least in framework of perturbation theory ( in all orders ) by the coupling constant .",
    "this lf hamiltonian can be used for non - perturbative calculation of mass spectrum of qcd .",
    "its main advantage , in comparison to the hamiltonian which has been constructed in article ref .",
    "@xcite , is a finite - dimensional space of states in the dlcq method .",
    "in addition , the use of a lattice can give hopes that the number of unknown factors would be smaller , because instead of violating gauge invariance ( see a more accurate discussion in sect .",
    "4 ) , there is only a partial violation of lorenz invariance .    the transverse lattice method which includes",
    "the construction of the lf hamiltonian and introduction of the transverse lattice is very useful for description of qcd ( see review ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , in this approach , the method of arbitrary complex matrices is usually understood as a transition to new `` colour - dielectric '' variables which correspond to important degrees of freedom on the coarse lattice@xcite . at the same time , there is no clear view how to extrapolate results into the small region @xmath6 ( see the remark in ref .",
    "also , a `` naive '' lf hamiltonian is used usually .",
    "that is why new interesting results may be obtained if we construct a `` corrected '' lf hamiltonian corresponding to renormalized theory with non - physical degrees of freedom switching off in the limit @xmath7",
    ". this can be useful for a substantiation of transverse lattice method .",
    "in present paper , we take a first step to the construction of a `` corrected '' lf hamiltonian for a theory with transverse lattice . instead of qcd , we consider a pure nonabelian gauge field theory .",
    "transition from such model to full qcd is not so complicated and it is fully based on the results , obtained for this model . considering pure nonabelian gauge theory allows to focus on the features of this theory .",
    "we propose the action of theory on the lattice ( sect .",
    "2 ) , construct feynman perturbation theory ( sect .",
    "3 ) , and consider all feynman diagrams that do not contain divergences ( sect .  5 ) . we can show that in the some limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 such diagrams are either equal to corresponding diagrams of continuous theory , either equal to zero ( which corresponds to switching off the non - physical degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the obtained result is also true for diagrams with divergence , but only after applying some procedure of subtraction , if in a result of this procedure the indices of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence @xmath9 become negative .",
    "this fact is very significant for renormalization of the theory , because it is the main tool at the analysis of divergent parts of diagrams .",
    "it is necessary to note , that limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 are not independent .",
    "parameter @xmath10 plays a role of mass for non - physical degrees of freedom and the above formulated statement is true only if @xmath10 a function of @xmath6 satisfying certain conditions .",
    "the statement mentioned above is enough for renormalization of the theory on transverse lattice if we do not take into account the possibility of occurrence of non - polynomial with respect to momenta divergences .",
    "such possibility exists because lorentz invariance is broken in the given theory , however the results of preliminary analysis show that non - polynomial divergences are absent for green functions . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss this subject , we do not go beyond the description of the scheme of renormalization procedure ( sect .",
    "the accurate construction of this procedure which leads to occurrence of action of the theory with all necessary counterterms will be presented in the further work . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the problems of uv divergences of the theory that remain when transverse lattice is applied .",
    "it is necessary to notice that in this paper we use gauge group @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 .",
    "this fact is not significant because for pure nonabelian gauge field theory , abelian and nonabelian components of gauge field do not interact in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "we do not use immediately the group @xmath12 , because for @xmath12 the propagator of the non - physical degree of freedom , corresponding to abelian part of transverse gauge field , do not sufficiently decrease at large momenta .",
    "we formulate gauge theory in 4d space - time , where two space - like directions are replaced with the square lattice . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we choose variables of the theory in such a way that the actions of the theory are polynomial . in this case , the components of gauge field along continuous coordinates are described in a usual way and related to the vertices of the lattice .",
    "the components of field along discrete coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 are described by complex @xmath16 matrices ( in the case of @xmath11 theory . )",

    "for example , the expression @xmath23 corresponds to the cycle shown in fig .  2 , _",

    "the selected factor @xmath187 causes the left - hand part of ( [ 34 ] ) to vanish in the limit @xmath13 .    as a result ,",
    "the value of diagrams of the considered class , without propagators of field @xmath139 and without extra vertices , tend ( in the limit @xmath13 ) to the values of corresponding diagrams of continuous gauge field theory with group @xmath11 .    as the second step",

    "these diagrams vanish in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "let us show this fact .",
    "if a diagram contains the propagators of field @xmath139 ( we assume the number of such propagators to be equal to @xmath190 ) , then we can estimate euclidian form of these propagators @xmath191 we can estimate the rest parts of integrand in eq .",

    "we now analyse the form of extended vertices in eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the difference @xmath194 is less than or equal to the number of vertices which correspond to the penultimate term of ( [ 22 ] ) ( the contribution of such a vertex in @xmath194 is equal to 1 , contribution of other extended vertices is less than or equal to zero ) .",
    "mentioned vertex should be connected to one or more propagators of field @xmath139 . as a result , a number of these vertices is less than or equal to the doubled number of propagators of field @xmath139 .",
    "( we take into account that considered diagrams have only external lines corresponding to the field @xmath137 . ) as a result , we obtain inequation @xmath195    we enumerate with the index @xmath196 the different subdiagrams ( including the full diagram ) of this diagram .",
    "we denote as @xmath197 the corresponding characteristics of subdiagrams ( we suppose that external lines of a subdiagrams are not included into subdiagrams ) .",
    "an inequality , similar to ( [ 37 ] ) , is not true for arbitrary subdiagrams , because arbitrary subdiagrams can contain external lines corresponding to the field @xmath139 .",
    "however , this inequality is true for characteristics of a part of the diagram not included in subdiagrams ( where external lines of subdiagrams are included to this part ) : @xmath198    the inequality @xmath199 is a true for all diagrams of the class .",
    "hence , taking into account ( [ 29]),([29.1 ] ) , we can make a conclusion that inequality @xmath200 is true .",
    "the indices of divergence for the estimating integral in formula ( [ 36 ] ) are larger than corresponding indices for initial diagram ( [ 28 ] ) by @xmath201 , because @xmath202 copies of the propagators estimated by formula ( [ 35 ] ) do not contribute to the indices .",
    "this fact is true for subdiagrams as well .",
    "hence , the estimated integral , in its turn , can be estimated ( with accuracy up to logarithmic corrections ) by @xmath203 here , we take the maximum among all subdiagrams ( including the full diagram ) and use the formula ( [ 39 ] ) . substituting estimation ( [ 40 ] ) in ( [ 36 ] ) , we obtain estimation for the value of diagram in form @xmath204 when taking into account ( [ 38 ] ) , this estimation can be changed as @xmath205 previously , we assumed that parameter @xmath10 increases as @xmath160 with accuracy up to logarithmic corrections . using this assumption and inequality ( [ 37 ] ) , we can obtain that either value of diagram tends to zero , either @xmath206 i.e. it behaves as @xmath207 . on this step of reasoning",
    "we assume that diagram containing at least one propagator of field @xmath139 ( hence @xmath208 ) or at least one extra vertex ( hence @xmath209 ) .",
    "but if @xmath208 then ( taking into account ( [ 43 ] ) ) @xmath209 ( we note that @xmath159 is not equal to zero at @xmath210 ) . therefore , if ( [ 43 ] ) is true then @xmath209 is true too .",
    "therefore , value of the diagram is equal to zero in the limit @xmath13 if we suppose that product @xmath211 logarithmically tends to zero .",
    "it is possible if we assume @xmath212 where @xmath213 is parameter of dimension of mass .",
    "so , as a result , if we have to assume ( [ 44 ] ) than all diagrams of this class ( the diagrams with external lines type @xmath137 and with @xmath167 for full diagrams and all subdiagrams of these diagrams ) either vanish in the limit @xmath13 either tend to the value of corresponding diagrams of continuous gauge theory on group @xmath11 .",
    "we can find the general form of such diagrams .",
    "we can analyze the contribution of propagators ( [ 25.1])-([25.3 ] ) to the value @xmath153 , which defined by formula ( [ 29 ] ) , and contribution of vertices from expression ( [ 26]),([27 ] ) and extra vertices from ( [ 22 ] ) to one .",
    "we have , that the contribution of all propagators of internal lines ( the propagator @xmath214 can be only external ) is equal to `` @xmath215 '' , the contribution of vertices with three tails is equal to `` @xmath216 '' and the contribution of vertices with four tails is equal to `` @xmath217 '' . hence , via standard reasoning , we can make conclusion that usual formula of continuous theory @xmath218 is true for 1pi diagrams of considered theory . here , @xmath219 is number of external lines of the diagram .",
    "also we can show that estimation @xmath220 is true for quantity @xmath221 . here",
    "@xmath186 is number of loops of diagram and @xmath222 is number of external lines of the diagram corresponding to the field @xmath223 .",
    "note , that the 1pi diagrams with these external lines do not give contribution to green functions , but these diagrams give the contribution in vertex part @xmath224 .",
    "the analogue of word identities is useful to be build in terms of these functions .",
    "it is necessary to use such identities in construction of renormalization procedure for considered theory . using formulas ( [ 45]),([46 ] )",
    "we can see that the considered class of diagrams contains diagrams with external lines type @xmath137 and with @xmath225 and @xmath226 ( it should be true for full diagram and for all subdiagrams of the diagram ) .",
    "the obtained in this section result is true for these diagrams .",
    "the obtained result is also true for diagrams with divergence , but only after applying some procedure of subtraction , if in a result of this procedure the indices @xmath9 become negative .",
    "this fact is very useful for renormalization of the theory , because it is the main tool at the analysis of divergent parts of diagrams .",
    "in order to find correct form of the theory on transverse lattice which transforms into usual gauge theory ( which contains both abelian and nonabelian parts ) in the limit @xmath13 , we should find correct renormalization .",
    "for this we should the counterterms to action ( [ 10 ] ) which provide the cancellation of the divergence parts of all diagrams . in this article",
    ", we only describe the scheme of such renormalization procedure .",
    "let s remind , that we study only gauge invariant `` third '' form of the theory without longitudinal divergences ( see in sect .",
    "the renormalization of nonabelian gauge theory ( without introduction of lattice ) in light - like gauge @xmath107 using dimensional regularization was perfomed in the work ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in such approach",
    "there is an additional problem for the analysis of the diagrams divergences because lorentz invariance is broken .",
    "therefore , the divergence at the transverse momentum @xmath227 can be worse than the total divergence of diagram ( see , for example , form of propagator ( [ 25.1 ] ) ) . as a result",
    ", divergent parts of diagrams can contain non - polynomial parts with respect to momenta .    as a first step of renormalization on transverse lattice",
    ", we should develop the subtraction procedure for divergent parts of the diagrams . using this procedure ,",
    "we can obtain the dependence of the divergent parts of the diagrams from the external momenta of these diagrams .",
    "in perturbation theory the lattice regularization lead to appearance of field @xmath63 , modification of propagator of field @xmath68 ( which give usual expression for propagator in limit @xmath13 ) , additional numbers of vertices and cutoff of transverse momentum , see sect .",
    "3 . using the results of sect .  5 , we can expect that the divergent parts of diagrams are polynomials of second order or less on external momenta .",
    "we note that the order of these polynomials is determined by usual dimensional reasons .",
    "the exception can arise only for small number of diagrams with divergence along the transverse momentum .",
    "further , we can formulate an analog of word identities because theories are gauge invariant ( we note again , that the longitudinal divergences was removed by gauge invariant means , see in sect .  4 ) .",
    "if we write the analogue of word identities in terms of vertex part @xmath228 $ ] ( which is a generation functional for 1pi diagrams ) then these identities should contain 1pi diagrams with external lines corresponding to field @xmath223 .",
    "for this reason we introduce the field @xmath113 in the theory ( see ( [ 23 ] ) ) , instead of assuming @xmath107 ( as in work ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although these diagrams do not contribute to full green functions of field @xmath68 .    also , we should use remained space symmetries .",
    "they are rotational symmetry in longitudinal space @xmath229 ( for euclidean form of theory ) , and the symmetry of discrete group of rotations on @xmath49 in transverse space @xmath75 , see equations ( [ 12])-([12.2 ] ) and the text neer .",
    "it should be noted that the divergent part can contain constant vectors @xmath230 which are contained in the propagator ( [ 25.1 ] ) , because gauge was fixed .",
    "however , this is possible only if corresponding expression is invariant of the product of @xmath231 by any constant , and , simultaneously , division of @xmath232 by the same constant ( the propagator ( [ 25.1 ] ) have this invariance ) .",
    "as long as an analog of word identities are satisfied , we can expect gauge invariance of counterterms , which cancel the divergences of all diagrams .",
    "these counterterms should not break also the existent space symmetry . as the preliminary analysis show",
    ", this fact leads to the usual stretch of field @xmath233 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 at the process of renormalization ( we note that abelian and nonabelian parts of field stretch independently ) and renormalization of coupling constant @xmath88 . also , certain renormalization factors appear in different part items @xmath54 ( see ( [ 12 ] ) ) and @xmath52 of the action ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that some terms that satisfy all symmetries and contain vectors @xmath230 can appear in the action .",
    "this fact was found in ref .",
    "that is why if we renormalize the theory , a number of unknown factors may appear in the action because total lorentz invariance was broken by transverse lattice and non - physical fields appeared .",
    "construction of the exact form of counterterms requires carefully performing the renormalization of theory on transverse lattice in according with the scheme described in this section .",
