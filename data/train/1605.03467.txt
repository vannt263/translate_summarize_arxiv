    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation plays a crucial role in many processes of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , such as photoelectric heating , grain charging , photoionization , and photo - dissociation of molecules @xcite , in which the far - ultraviolet ( fuv : 6ev @xmath11 13.6ev ) radiation from massive stars or interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) influences the structure , chemistry , thermal balance , and evolution of neutral interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying these influence helps to understand the process of star formation .",
    "the fuv emission selectively dissociates co rare isotopologues more effectively than co owing to different levels of self - shielding effects @xcite . for the fuv emission with energy high enough to photodissociate @xmath12co , it rapidly becomes optically thick when it penetrates into molecular clouds .",
    "in contrast , the self - shielding effect of c@xmath1o is relatively less significant because of the shift of its absorption lines and its low abundance .",
    "therefore , the fuv emission with energy above the c@xmath1o dissociation level is expected to penetrate relatively deeper in a molecular cloud , and the abundance ratio of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o , @xmath4 , will increase when the self - shielding effect of c@xmath1o does not yet dominate . when the self - shielding effect of both @xmath0co and c@xmath1o become important , the abundance ratio should decrease toward the intrinsic abundance value which derived from abundances of the elements , @xmath12c , @xmath0c , @xmath13o , and @xmath1c . the intrinsic value may vary as the distance to the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 has been observed in regions with various conditions . in the typical massive star - forming regions , where the ism is filled up with diffuse fuv flux from ob stars , the measurements of @xmath4 are usually higher than the intrinsic value .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath4 in the orion - a giant molecular cloud ( orion - a gmc ) and found that the @xmath4 of most regions are a factor of two greater than 5.5 , the typical value in the solar system .",
    "it is possible that besides the interstellar fuv radiation , embedded ob stars provide strong fuv radiation so that the distance of the penetration will increase .",
    "another possibility is that the higher temperature in the massive cores will also change the fractionation of @xmath12c and @xmath0c @xcite . in the intermediate - mass star - forming regions",
    ", @xcite showed that the intensity ratio of @xmath0co ( @xmath14=21 ) to c@xmath1o ( @xmath14=21 ) , which is equivalent to @xmath4 for optically thin case , rises to a peak up to @xmath240 at @xmath8 5mag then decreases to @xmath24.5 with increasing @xmath7 in the southeast of the california molecular cloud .",
    "although the trend is consistent with the theoretical expectations , the peak occurs at somewhat higher extinction ; @xcite showed that the peak is at @xmath813mag for regions with various density from 10@xmath15 to 10@xmath16@xmath17 . in the low - mass star - forming regions ,",
    "@xcite observed a part of the ic 5146 filament and found that the @xmath4 value is considerably greater than 5.5 in the outer parts ( @xmath18 10mag ) .",
    "ldn 1551 ( hereafter l1551 ) is a relatively isolated nearby star - forming region located at a distance of 160pc @xcite at the south end of the taurus - auriga - perseus molecular cloud complex",
    ". two small clusters of young stellar objects ( ysos ) were detected in l1551 .",
    "one contains two embedded class i sources , l1551 irs 5 ( hereafter irs 5 ) and l1551 ne ( hereafter ne ) , and the other is a group of more evolved ysos ( hereafter hl tau group ) located at the north of irs 5 and ne .",
    "the irs 5/ne cluster co - host a parsec - scale bipolar outflow @xcite which is likely mixed from outflows of each source @xcite .",
    "several herbig - haro objects along the outflows have been identified with different origins @xcite .",
    "another east - west redshifted outflow was found later @xcite , but since irs 5 and ne are two binary systems @xcite the origin of this east - west outflow is still questionable @xcite .",
    "the hl tau group contains hl tau , xz tau , lkh@xmath19 358 , and v1213 tau . the jets and outflows of hl tau group were detected in optical observations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the protostars , a gravitationally bound starless core , l1551 mc , is found at the north - western side of the irs 5/ne cluster which may have started gravitational collapse or could be supported by magnetic fields of @xmath2160@xmath20 g @xcite .",
    "since l1551 dose not contain ob stars , l1551 is a suitable target for studying the fuv influence only from the interstellar radiation .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to study the variation of @xmath4 under the influence of the interstellar fuv radiation .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , we observed @xmath12co ( @xmath14=10 ) , @xmath0co ( @xmath14=10 ) , and c@xmath1o ( @xmath14=10 ) lines using the 25-beam array receiver system ( bears ) receiver equipped on the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) 45 m telescope to obtain data that could resolve the sub - parsec scale with a complete coverage from the outskirts of the cloud into its dense region .",

    "in general , the spectra of @xmath0co ( @xmath14=10 ) and c@xmath1o ( @xmath14=10 ) show single - component velocity structures , and thus we can apply single - gaussian fitting as an appropriate method .",

    "if the residual of the fitting at the peak velocity is less than 3@xmath34 , we take the peak intensity to calculate the excitation temperature .",
    "second , if the single - gaussian fitting fails , we apply double - gaussian fitting to separate the ambient and outflow components . except the regions around ne , only one redshifted or blueshifted component appears .",
    "we identify the component of which the peak velocity is similar to the peak velocities of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o spectra as the ambient component and the other component as the outflow component , if ( 1 ) the residuals of the fitting at both the peak velocities are less than 3@xmath34 and ( 2 ) the velocity ranges of the two gaussian components at half maximum are not overlapped with each other . the later criterion is included , because the determination of the peak intensity of the ambient component could be affected by the close outflow component . in some cases , the peak @xmath12co intensity is even smaller than the peak @xmath0co intensity , which is not physical and is rejected .",
    "third , for the remaining spectra , the velocity structure seems to contain three or more components .",
    "since our goal is to obtain the peak intensity of the ambient gas , we only apply a single gaussian to one peak having the peak velocity closest to the ambient gas velocity determined from the @xmath0co and c@xmath1o spectra at the same position .",
    "we fix the peak velocity of this single gaussian as the mean value of the @xmath0co and c@xmath1o peak velocities and we only fit the gaussian within a narrow velocity range bracketed by the two local minima around the peak . following the above procedure",
    ", we obtain the estimate of the excitation temperature from the peak intensity of the fitted gaussian to the ambient @xmath12co emission .",

    "the cavity is clearly seen in the blueshifted velocities with respect to the mean velocity of 6.7 km s@xmath26 . because the cavity is on top of the redshifted outflows from irs 5/ne , we speculate that the gas on the cavity region is pushed toward us by the redshifted outflows .",

    "this filamentary structure can also be recognized in the @xmath0co channel maps ( the 6.25kms@xmath26 panel of fig.[fig_ch_13co ] ) and the h@xmath82 column density map ( fig.[fig_intro ] ( d ) ) .",
    "a u - shaped wall structure is present in the velocity range from 6.75kms@xmath26 to 7.05 km , which coincides with the redshifted part of the u - shaped wall traced in @xmath0co .",
    "another fainter filamentary structure can be seen in the velocity range from 7.05kms@xmath26 to 7.35kms@xmath26 , and its position is just above the upper arm of the u - shaped wall .",
    "figure [ fig_mom ] ( c ) and ( f ) are the c@xmath1o mean velocity and the velocity dispersion maps , respectively . within the u - shaped wall ,",
    "the integrated intensity becomes low and the gas is mostly blueshifted ( see fig.[fig_intro ] ( c ) ) .",
