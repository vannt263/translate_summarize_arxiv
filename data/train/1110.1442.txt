    "the central goal of rhic / lhc heavy - ion program is to study the quantitative properties of the phases of qcd .",
    "the bulk properties of this hot and dense qgp medium is going to be used to extract the physics characters : @xmath0 etc . while the single particles observables are the natural points , the following sections will show the methods of correlations are also powerful and necessary .",
    "the single particles @xmath1 measurement at rhic shows clearly pid dependence .",
    "the mesons , whether of light quarks or charm / bottom quarks , all indicate strong suppression patterns at high-@xmath2 .  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the `` baryon anomaly '' and direct-@xmath3 @xmath1 measurements show strong medium effects on the particle production mechanisms .",
    "this medium effects is further studied in the recent lhc data , where the @xmath4 is more than a factor of 10 higher .",
    "the @xmath1 of mesons is reported to be very close at lhc as rhic at 5<@xmath2<20 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite it has been discussed if the same `` quark soup '' had been cooked at lhc and rhic .",
    "thus , it is necessary to introduce correlation method to study the medium in further details .",
    "correlations can be studied in two ways , triggered and untriggered .",
    "the triggers are usually high-@xmath2 particles as proxies of jets , or jets themselves .",
    "because jets are considered to originate from hard - scattering of partons which happen at the early age of qgp formation , they have a high chance of carrying the information of medium by flying through and interact with medium , thus are good probes of medium . however , the raw correlations contain not only jets , but also bulk medium information , mainly the flow items ( @xmath6 ) , and these properties have their own centrality dependence other than that of jets .",
    "these flow factors then bring complexity to the correlations study .",
    "for example , rhic has reported the `` cone '' and `` ridge '' structures  @xcite .",
    "while the first even order flow @xmath7 has been subtracted , questions still rise as whether these structures are evidence of modified jets production , or these are fluctuations and/or evolution of medium itself that coincide with trigger particles .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to disentangle these flow factors from jets correlations at much detail .",
    "higher order @xmath6 , and not only even order but also odd orders , needs to be considered and subtracted carefully .",
    "this is where the untriggered correlations come to use , which will bring us the so - called @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc .",
    "while the flow items can be measured through untriggered correlations , the effort to disentangle them from jets were already made even earlier through multi - particle correlations . in the @xmath11 correlation paper  @xcite , by studying the cross - pair densities at `` jet '' and `` ridge '' regions , the possibility of particles correlated in physics between these two was found to be close to zero within errors .",
    "this paper then claimed `` no correlation is found between production of the ridge and production of the jet - like particles , suggesting the ridge may be formed from the bulk medium itself . ''",
    "the higher order @xmath6s , especially those odd order items , has been noticed in the recent years as the possible explanations of the `` cone '' and `` ridge '' structures . in figure.[figure_paul_sorensen_qm11_v3 ] the recent star @xmath12 measurements are shown .",
    "@xcite here the @xmath10 items exhibit effects of elliptic overlap geometry and follow an @xmath13 trend similar to @xmath7  @xcite , indicating the possible source of initial density fluctuations manifesting into momentum space  @xcite .",
    "measurements as a function of centrality and collision energy.,width=491 ]    since such fluctuation models agree with data , showing at most central collisions the @xmath6 drop with n at low @xmath2 but @xmath14 at intermediate @xmath2 , it is natural to ask if these @xmath6 together can reproduce the `` cone '' and `` ridge '' structures at rhic . in figure.[figure_shinichi_esumi_qm11_v3 ] it is proved to be a great success in central au+au data , where the `` mach - cone '' is almost gone  @xcite , although remaining medium effect can possibly exist .",
    "subtracted.,width=491 ]    however , this is not the end of story yet .",
    "since the 2nd and 3rd order event planes , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , are weakly correlated  @xcite , it means the measurement that @xmath7 modulations subtracted correlation shapes still keep strong @xmath15 dependence can not be explained by pure @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "currently the measured @xmath6s have weak @xmath17 dependence from long @xmath18 away @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but the long @xmath18 non - flow contributions ca nt be excluded yet",
    ". meanwhile , the higher order @xmath6 contributions may also be needed even if their magnitude is small",
    ".    the next step of studying @xmath6 modulations will be the pid - ed measurements , similar to what was done in the single particle @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath20 scaling @xmath7 has long be used as an evidence of partonic flow within qgp  @xcite , and the recent pid - ed @xmath10 measurements at rhic are consistent with this ncq - scaling picture at intermediate @xmath2 region  @xcite .",
    "thus the correlation functions are expected to show an evident mass splitting effect , based on higher order @xmath6 modulation pattern , on structures such as `` cone '' and `` ridge '' .",
    "this is confirmed in the star pid - ed trigger correlation in figure.[figure_kolja_kauder_qm11_pid_correlation ] , where trigger particles are grouped into charged pions and charged kaons / protons , then the low-@xmath2 associated particles are plotted . a clear mass splitting effect between triggers exists  @xcite .",
    "projections show mass - splitting effect on `` cone '' structure , while the @xmath18 projections show that on `` ridge''.,width=491 ]    the pid - ed @xmath6s can bring more questions . a much weaker centrality dependence of @xmath10 at intermediate @xmath2 has been observed at rhic and lhc , contrary to that of @xmath7 , and this is commonly considered an evidence of @xmath10 being caused by initial state density inhomogeneity  @xcite , as were predicted by theory models . on the other hand ,",
    "the baryons `` anomaly '' enhancements relative to mesons in a+a collisions are well - known to be centrality dependent . if @xmath10 is partonic flow as indicated from rhic / lhc data , then the weak centrality dependence of @xmath10 has to be due to a complex convolution among @xmath21 , pid - ed @xmath10 , and baryon anomaly .",
    "is it a simple coincidence , or an indication of deeper relations between these physics mechanisms ?",
    "this is being studied through multiple analysis working in progress , including the @xmath10 modulations in the pid - ed trigger correlations , and non - flow effect in long @xmath18 correlations .      while the low-@xmath2 @xmath6 are mainly from collective effect , the high-@xmath2 particles measured at rhic are dominated by jet source .",
    "since the high-@xmath2 @xmath7 is nt approaching zero  @xcite , this is a strong evidence of jet quenching in medium .",
    "then a similar question rises , do jets also induce @xmath10 ? this is studied from more than one ways .",
    "first , a pair of high-@xmath2 triggers are used as proxies of jets , called `` 2 + 1 '' correlations .",
    "on contrary to the normal 2-particle correlations , the two triggers are required to be back - to - back in the azimuthal plane to tag `` back - to - back hard - scattering '' events .",
    "the low-@xmath2 associates are then studied around both triggers with @xmath7 modulation subtracted .",
    "the energy asymmetry between the two triggers are also varied as a method to control the relative medium travelling length of both partons  @xcite . in figure.[figure_hua_pei_2plus1_correlation ] a set of typical 2 + 1 correlation functions are shown , and no @xmath10 observed",
    ".     triggers .",
    "the @xmath22 projections and @xmath18 projections both show similar shapes and magnitudes between d+au and central au+au data after @xmath7 modulation subtracted , indicating no evidence of @xmath10 . the ratios of associated spectra also show no evident modification.,width=566 ]    second , the fully reconstructed jets are directly applied as triggers . in figure.[figure_alice_ohlson_jet_correlation ] the axis of jets are used as trigger direction and all particles are plotted around this axis .",
    "while the @xmath7 modulations are evident especially at low-@xmath2 region as expected , the @xmath7 subtracted correlation functions do nt leave much space for possible higher - order @xmath6 such as @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "projections are plotted on both low- and high-@xmath2 associates .",
    "the dashed lines show current estimation of @xmath7 modulations.,width=491 ]",
    "it is important to understand that all the medium properties from correlation measurements , either @xmath6 or jet correlations , are induced by hot nuclear matter effects in addition to the modification of nuclear target relative to `` vacuum '' collisions of protons and dis collisions .",
    "therefore , the cold - nuclear - matter ( cnm ) effect has to be studied as a baseline .",
    "the figure.[figure_ermes_braidot_dau_correlation ] shows the correlations in d+au comparing to p+p .",
    "the triggers and associates are selected to be separated in broad @xmath18 similar as those @xmath6 measured in event - plane method .",
    "currently , no significant broadening or away - side peak suppression observed in d+au comparing to p+p  @xcite .",
    "this proves at current stage that the observed long @xmath18 higher - order @xmath6 are still hot nuclear matter specific .",
    "recent measurements of higher order fourier harmonics @xmath6 at rhic has been an important role to disentangle different sources of physics , by successfully reproducing the correlation structures ( cone / ridge ) with little help from jets - medium interaction .",
    "while these higher - order @xmath6 are widely considered to be produced by initial geometry fluctuations , more quantitative analysis and theory predictions are necessary , including their dependence on @xmath2 , @xmath18 , centrality , pid , etc . at high-@xmath2 end ,",
    "the hadron correlations using multiple high - energy triggers and/or fully reconstructed jets show no signal of higher - order @xmath6 on contrary to @xmath7 .",
    "this observation also supports the assumptions of @xmath7 and high - order @xmath6 from different sources .",
    "meanwhile , no evident cold - nuclear - matter effect was observed for higher - order @xmath6 , indicating they are hot nuclear matter specific ."
