    "in recent years , the impact of stock trades on price change has attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",

    "buy ( sell ) orders are often followed by more buy ( sell ) orders , leading to a long  memory self ",
    "correlation of trade signs  @xcite .",
    "this is so , because the traders prefer to split large orders into smaller fragments to conceal their trading intentions and to keep the liquidity costs as low as possible .",
    "this self  correlation of the order flow generates the stock price self ",
    "response to the trades .",
    "the price is determined by a continuous double auction  @xcite with market and limit orders .",
    "the market orders are executed immediately at the best available price .",
    "although they do not appear in the order book , they either keep the quote unchanged when the trading volumes are smaller than the market depth or move the price up ( down ) if they are buyer ( seller ) initiated . on the other hand",
    "the limit orders are executed at the price the traders specified , which is a process that takes time .",
    "they are listed in the order book as quotes , _",
    "i.e. _ bids and asks , corresponding to the buy and sell limit orders , respectively . the prices change persistently when buy or sell market orders come in , since they remove volumes of the limit orders from the order book and push the price from the best quote to a secondary quote .",
    "recently , we studied the price cross  response in a correlated market  @xcite .",

    "response , the cross  response as well as the cross  correlation of trade signs strongly suffers from noise , leading to drastic fluctuations at large time lags .",
    "the sign cross  correlation was thus found to have short memory .",
    "for the cross ",
    "response , a given stock is related to several or many others .",
    "that is partly due to economic dependencies of the companies and to the grouping of investments in portfolios , but there may also be other reasons for the mutual impact .",
    "suppose , for example , a trader who considers a stock as presently underpriced and likely to raise in the near future .",
    "to buy many shares of this stock he might use the profit from selling other stocks .",
    "if many others act correspondingly , an impact results : buying ( selling ) this stock affects the other stocks which are sold ( bought ) . by discussing this scenario ,",
    "we want to motivate that averaging the cross  response functions over different stocks that are paired with the same stock can yield interesting new observations .",
    "furthermore , such averages will also to some extent smoothen the drastic fluctuations of the sign cross  correlations at large time lags and reduce the cross  response noise .",

    "the 99 stocks include the first ten stocks with the largest average market capitalization in each economic sector , except for the telecommunications services with only nine available stocks in that year .",
    "we recall that the average market capitalization is obtained as the traded price multiplied with the traded volume , averaged over every trade during the year 2008 .",
    "in addition , the 99 stocks are also used to work out the @xmath2 cross  response matrix in sect .",

    "the most popular one was proposed by lee and ready  @xcite .",
    "the trade sign is determined by comparing the traded price with the preceding midpoint price of the best buy and sell quotes",
    ". if the traded price is larger than the preceding midpoint price , the trade is buyer  initiated , and otherwise seller  initiated .",
    "the lee and ready algorithm is able to correctly classify at least 85@xmath13 of all the trades .",
    "unfortunately , as the trades and quotes are recorded in two separate files on time scale of one second , _ i.e. _ , not distinguishing what happens within these one  second intervals , it is not always possible to associate the trades with their preceding quotes at time scales smaller than one second .",
    "another approach is put forward by holthausen , leftwich and mayers  @xcite .",
    "the trade is classified as buyer or seller  initiated if the traded price is different from the previous price .",
    "the advantage is that the trading sequence can be identified only using the trades file .",
    "as the trade is not classified when the two consecutive prices are the same , this approach has a rather low accuracy of 52.8@xmath13 .",
    "recently , we put forward a third approach  @xcite in which a trade with the same price as the preceding one is also classified . compared to the second approach",
    ", it has a considerably higher accuracy of 85@xmath13 .",
    "this number is based on tests carried out with six samples , where in total 308857 transactions were identified . here",
    ", we again employ the third approach , in which the trade sign is defined as @xmath14 where , @xmath15 denotes the price of the @xmath7th trade in the one  second time interval @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite , we studied the effects due to in or excluding these events .",
    "the cross ",
    "responses including @xmath37 are weaker than the ones excluding @xmath37 , because the latter is purely built up by trades , and the indirect influence of the lack of trades is omitted . however , either including or excluding @xmath37 does not change the trend of price reversion versus the time lag , but it does affect the cross  response strength . as a result , the market displays , at a given time lag @xmath23 , distinct cross  response structures . to analyze them , we defined  @xcite the normalized cross  responses , @xmath38 where the denominator is the maximum over all stock pairs @xmath0 for fixed @xmath23 .",

    "we distinguish the results for in or excluding @xmath37 .",
    "we checked that these empirical results are similar to those from averaging over the in each case remaining 98 stocks listed in app .",
    "[ appa ] . to facilitate the computation",
    ", we only calculate the average cross  response values at several time lags , which are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] , rather than at every second .",
    "the passive and active cross  response functions clearly show different behaviors .",
    "the passive cross ",
    "response reverses faster than the active one .",
    "it only persists dozens of seconds and then reverses to drop down quickly with sizeable volatility .",
    "in contrast , the active cross  response reverses at time lags of some hundreds of seconds and the price changes slowly .",
    "an obvious reason for this difference is the easier detectability of price changes in one stock than of those dispersed over different stocks . again , with our results , we can extend the previous interpretations based on the study of single stocks .",
    "the passive cross ",
    "response function reflects the price dynamics on short time scales .",
    "when the price goes up , less market orders to buy will be emitted and more limit orders to sell .",
    "thus , the price reverses  @xcite without a need to evoke new information as a cause .",
    "moreover , liquidity induced mean reversion attracts more buyers , which motivates liquidity providers to raise the price again , while the volatilities in this process of responding decline .",
    "thus , we conclude for the market as a whole that the mean reversion accentuates the short  period price volatility , which is consistent with the single  stock analysis  @xcite .",
    "the active cross  response reflects the dispersion of the trade impacts over the prices of different stocks .",
    "it is conceivable that this process takes longer compared to the time scales of the passive cross  response .",
    "furthermore , this dispersion is accompanied by spreading out the volatilities .    as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] , for the average cross  responses including @xmath37 , the active ones are all stronger than the passive ones at their maximum values .",
    "the reason for the different strengths of passive and active cross ",
    "responses is the existence of strongly influencing stocks . on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] , we observe that the vertical stripes are much more pronounced than the horizontal ones .",
    "more specifically , there are groups of stocks which have a strong influence across most of the market , in particular , this is evident for the stocks in the it sector .",
    "consequently , the active cross  response of these stocks averaged over the market shows a strong signal . as for the passive cross ",
    "response , however , fewer influenced stocks contribute , which leads to a reduced value of the average . however , the strength difference is not so apparent for the average cross  responses excluding @xmath37 . the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] shows that the influencing and influenced stocks contribute to the average cross ",
    "responses with similar strength .    to analyze the average trade sign cross ",
    "correlators depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig41 ] , we use the power law   to fit the empirical results . the fitting parameters and errors are shown in table  [ tab41 ] .",
    "the remarkable result is that the volatile short memory of the individual cross ",
    "correlators  @xcite turns into a long memory with exponents smaller than one after averaging .",
    "the only exception is the passive trade sign cross ",
    "correlator for the stock xom .",
    "we thus infer that the price changes caused by trade sign cross  correlations in different stocks can accumulate to persist over longer time .",
    "another interesting aspect is the decay period @xmath41 or @xmath42 of the sign cross  correlators . for stock pairs , the decay period excluding @xmath37 is longer than the one including @xmath37  @xcite",
    "this might be attributed to the influence of the lack of trading or to the balance of buy and sell market orders , which both accelerate the decay of sign cross  correlations . by averaging the cross  response across different stocks ,",
    "however , the two decay periods are effectively enhanced and become comparable .",
    "this is so because the noise is reduced by averaging , slowing down the decay and yielding long  memory sign cross  correlations .",
    "another observation which can be made in fig .",
    "[ fig31 ] is that the cross ",
    "responses vary for different economic sectors .",
    "in other words , the stocks from different sectors may produce different average cross  responses to a given stock .",
    "we calculate the average cross  responses of the stocks aapl , gs and xom to ten economic sectors in the s@xmath1p 500 index .",
    "the passive and active cross  responses are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig42 ] and  [ fig43 ] , respectively . both of the average cross ",
    "responses show a strong dependence on the economic sectors . here",
    ", we also consider the cross ",
    "responses in and and excluding @xmath37 , and we notice a remarkable difference for the passive cross  responses .",
    "the three stocks considered have in common that their prices are all affected by the trades within their own sectors , especially xom , which is not surprising due to the same economic effects .    the active cross ",
    "responses , for @xmath37 in and excluded , show time ",
    "dependent clustering across different sectors .",
    "this will be further discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec53 ] .",
    "the trades of aapl and gs have a significant impact on the prices of the stocks from financials ( f ) , but a lesser one on utilities ( u ) , health care ( hc ) , and consumer staples ( cs ) .",
    "this might be due to the stability of these sectors which serve the needs of daily life .",
    "the trades of xom are more likely to influence energy ( e ) , but have a lesser effect on health care ( hc ) and consumer staples ( cs ) .",

    "e.g. _ news , rather than by the impact of trades . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath37 is excluded , the linear relation disappears .",
    "the high trading frequency does not longer indicate the high influence of individual stocks .",
    "the strongly influencing stocks are more likely to be found in the stocks with an average daily number of trades smaller than 2000 .      as we know",
    ", the asynchronous trading induces spurious lead  lag correlations , and the returns of frequently traded stocks generally lead those of infrequently traded stocks @xcite .",
    "for example , incoming news influences the frequently traded stocks first , and then , after a time lag , the infrequently traded stocks . in our study ,",
    "the high correlation between the active cross  response including @xmath37 and the average daily number of trades might be misinterpreted such that the influence that the stocks exert is due to the lead ",
    "lag correlation of the return rather than due to the impact of trades .",
    "when including the zero trade signs , we take into account how the lack of trading or the balance of buy and sell market orders affects the impact of trades .",

    "response including @xmath37 is the one excluding @xmath37 scaled by a proper probability . obviously , the cross ",
    "response including @xmath37 can never be stronger than the one excluding @xmath37 .",
    "we now turn to the average cross  responses .",
    "passive and active cross  responses behave rather differently . for the passive cross  response including @xmath37 , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total number of stocks @xmath21 . the cross  responses excluding @xmath37 weighted with the factors @xmath58 have to be summed over different stocks @xmath21 to yield the passive cross ",
    "response including @xmath37 .",
    "remarkably , the difference of the stock ranks based on the passive cross ",
    "responses in and excluding @xmath37 is reduced by this average . on the other hand , for the active cross ",
    "response , we find @xmath61 because the factor @xmath58 is independent of the average of the cross ",
    "response excluding @xmath37 .",
    "the active cross  response including @xmath37 is simply proportional to the one excluding @xmath37 .",
    "this explains that the active cross  response including @xmath37 exhibits a high correlation with the average daily number of trades while the one excluding @xmath37 does not .",
    "we compared the self and cross  responses in a previous study  @xcite , focussing on the difference of self ",
    "responses on different time scales and on the difference of the self and cross ",
    "responses on the same time scale . here",
    ", we discuss the average cross  responses , and further clarify what happens on the physical time scale . the cross  responses as well as the sign cross  correlators for the stocks of aapl , gs and xom are displayed in figs",
    ".  [ fig61 ] and [ fig62 ] .",
    "the zero trade signs are included in the analysis , _",
    "i.e. _ , the influence of trading frequency is taking into account .",
    "figure  [ fig61 ] shows the comparisons of the self and cross  responses as well as the average cross  responses , _",
    "i.e. _ , passive and active cross  responses . typically , the self  response is stronger than the cross ",
    "response for two stocks due to the strong self  correlation of trade signs .",
    "the example of xom , however , shows that the cross  response can be stronger than the self  response .",
    "the average cross  responses are always weaker than the self  response , implying that cases such as xom are rare . due to the noise reduction we can follow the average cross  responses over a longer time interval . on shorter scales of the time lag @xmath23 , both , self and cross  responses , should be considered when looking at individual stocks , but for investigating cross ",
    "response stability , persistence or efficiency of the market as a whole , the average quantities give useful information on longer scales .    in fig .",
    "[ fig62 ] the trade sign self and cross  correlators corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig61 ] are depicted .",
    "the differences between these correlators are observable for time lags of less than 10 seconds . with the lag increasing , the self",
    " correlators are close to the cross ",
    "correlators for aapl and gs .",
    "the exceptional behavior of xom , however , shows up again in the sign correlators . in the study of the self ",
    "response  @xcite , a ` bare ' impact function with a power  law decay for a single trade was proposed to account for the amplification effect of sign self  correlations .",
    "it derives from the self ",
    "correlation accumulation with the time lag increasing .",
    "thus , the impact function and the sign self  correlation , mutually describe the price self  response . for xom , the sign self ",
    "correlator is larger than the cross ",
    "correlators before the appearance of correlation fluctuations , but its cross  response is stronger than the self  response .",
    "this implies that the impact functions of the self and cross  responses are different .",
    "in other words , there are different impact mechanisms between the self  and cross  responses .",
    "the averages that we perform produce the combined impacts of different stocks on individual stocks .",
    "the bare impact functions can not be observed directly .",
    "here , we observe the decay of the average sign cross  correlators . the passive and active cross  correlators are always smaller than the self",
    " correlators for aapl , gs and xom before the appearance of correlation fluctuations , which is consistent with the case of the cross  responses .",
    "thus , the combined impact function of the individual stocks is more stable than the ones for each stock pair .",
    "we introduced average cross  response functions , a passive and an active one , measuring the average price change of a given stock due to the trades of all others as well as the impact of trading a specific stock on the average price change of the other ones , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the passive cross ",
    "response reverses at a relatively short time lag of dozens of seconds or so and then declines rather quickly in a volatile way , while the active cross  response reverses at a longer time lag of some hundreds of seconds with less volatility .",
    "this is so , because the price change in one stock easily alerts the market participants .",
    "the dispersion over different stocks makes it more difficult to detect an effect due to the noise interference .",
    "the average cross  responses considerably reduce this noise , and make generic effects visible .",
    "we also introduced the corresponding active and passive trade sign cross  correlators .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the short memory for a stock pair turns into a long memory when averaged over different stock pairs .",
    "we compared the cross ",
    "responses in and excluding the zero trade signs .",
    "the cross ",
    "response including the zero trade signs reflects the weakened impact of trades due to a lack of trading or due to the balance of buy and sell market orders in one second .",
    "we showed that it is the cross ",
    "response excluding the zero trade signs , _",
    "i.e. _ the price impact purely caused by trades , scaled by a trading frequency on the time scale of one second . which stocks are identified as influencing by studying the active cross  responses differs for in and excluding zero trade signs",
    ". there is a high correlation with the average daily number of trades when including zero trade signs , but low correlation when excluding zero trade signs .",
    "we also compared the self ",
    "response with the various cross  responses . on shorter scales of the time lag , it is useful to consider the self and the cross",
    " responses for individual stocks .",
    "however , on longer scales , the average cross ",
    "responses give interesting new information for investigating the stability , persistence or the efficiency of the market as a whole .",
    "moreover , the comparison of sign self and cross  correlators reveals the existence of different impact mechanisms .",
