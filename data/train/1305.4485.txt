    "the modelling of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stellar evolutionary phase plays a critical role in many astrophysical issues , from the chemical composition of meteorites belonging to the pre - solar nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , up to the cosmological context of galaxy evolution in the high - redshift universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , luminous tp - agb stars are potentially the dominant contribution to a galaxy s flux , particularly at the red wavelengths and high redshifts that are much of the focus of modern extragalactic astronomy . in spite of its importance ,",
    "the tp - agb phase is still affected by large uncertainties which uncomfortably propagate into the field of current population synthesis models of galaxies that , for this reason , are strongly debated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the evolution along tp - agb phase is determined in a crucial way by processes which are challenging to model from first principles : turbulent convection , stellar winds , and long - period variability .",
    "also , these processes do not take place in a steady and smooth way during the tp - agb evolution , but greatly vary in both character and efficiency over the single thermal pulse cycles ( tpc ) ",
    "the @xmath1 to @xmath2-yr long periods that go from one he - shell flash , through quiescent h - shell burning , up to the next he - flash .",
    "moreover , the rich nucleosynthesis in the intershell convective region followed by recurrent dredge - up episodes , and the nuclear burning at the base of the convective envelope ( hot - bottom burning , hbb ) of the most massive tp - agb stars ( @xmath3 ) , can dramatically change the surface abundances , and hence the envelope structure , over a timescale much shorter than a single tpc .",
    "the result is that the modelling of the tp - agb phase is quite difficult , time consuming , and affected by large uncertainties .",
    "efforts to follow this phase with `` full models '' , which solve the time - dependent equations of stellar structure with the aid of classical 1d stellar evolution codes , are becoming increasingly successful thanks to the speeding - up of modern processors , and to the particular care devoted to the nucleosynthesis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , full tp - agb models still meet three fundamental difficulties .",
    "+ ( 1 ) they are affected by quite subtle and nasty numerical uncertainties , that can greatly affect the predicted efficiency of convective dredge - up episodes even within the same set of models @xcite .",
    "+ ( 2 ) full tp - agb models need to resort to parametrized descriptions of crucial processes ( mass loss , convection , overshoot ) , with theoretical formulations and `` efficiency parameters '' that may largely vary from study to study , so that to date no universally accepted set of prescriptions exists .",
    "this intrigued situation is well exemplified by fact that , for instance , the so - called carbon - star mystery , pointed out by @xcite in the far past , is now claimed to have been solved by full tp - agb models @xcite . however , it is somewhat disturbing to recognize that the same observable , i.e. the carbon star luminosity function of carbon stars in the large magellanic cloud , seems to be recovered by different full tp - agb models in which the third dredge - up takes place with very different characteristics ( in this respect , see sect .",
    "[ ssec_3dup ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_3dup3z02 ] ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the range of parameters to be covered , and prescriptions to be tested , in order to obtain grids of tp - agb models that reproduce the wide variety of observational data for agb stars in resolved galaxies , is simply too large .    in this tricky context",
    ", a valuable contribution may be provided by the so - called  synthetic models \" , in which the evolution from one thermal pulse to the next is described with analytical relations that synthesize the results of full models .",
    "being very agile and hence suitable to explore wide ranges of parameters and prescriptions , synthetic models can help to constrain the physical domain towards which full models should converge in order to reproduce observations of tp - agb stars ( e.g. carbon star luminosity functions ( cslf ) , c / m ratios , h - r diagrams , etc . ) .",
    "for instance , following the work of @xcite , based on synthetic models and focussed on the cslf in the large magellanic cloud , it became clear that the third dredge - up should not only be much more efficient , but also start earlier , at fainter luminosities , than usually predicted by full tp - agb models up to that time .    on the other hand",
    ", synthetic models are often criticised because they lack the accurate physics involved in the evolution of these stars .",
    "moreover , they are completely subordinate to the relations fitting the results of full agb model calculations , which severely limits their capability of exploring new evolutionary effects .",
    "a notable example is the effective temperature , for which various formulas have been proposed in the past in the usual form @xmath4 , involving luminosity , stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , their validity is extremely narrow as they can apply only to oxygen - rich stars ( with surface c / o@xmath5 ) , hence being unable to account for the hayashi limits of carbon stars . moreover ,",
    "these relations reflect the specific set of input physics adopted in the underlying full models , e.g. mixing - length parameter , gas opacities , equation of state , etc .    if this criticism reasonably applies to the purely analytic tp - agb models that rely on a mere compilation of fitting formulas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not as well suited to the class of hybrid models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the analytic formalism is complemented with numerical integrations of the stellar structure equations , carried out from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the convective envelope . in the latter case both the hbb nucleosynthesis and the basic changes in envelope structure  including effective temperature and radius  can be followed with the same richness of detail as in full models , but still in a much quicker and more versatile way .",
    "it is not by accident that the crucial role of the surface c / o ratio and c - rich opacities in determining the evolution of tp - agb stars was established just with the aid of these `` envelope - based models '' @xcite .",
    "although the same effect could have been assessed with the aid of full models , the latter were fighting with so many numerical and physical difficulties related to the occurrence of the third dredge - up , that the key aspect of the c - rich opacities was ignored , and likely forgotten , for long time in the field of agb stellar evolution . since @xcite , molecular opacities for c - rich mixtures",
    "have been progressively adopted in full tp - agb models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this example tells clearly that progresses in the description of the tp - agb phase do not rely only on full models , but they can come also from other complementary approaches .    with this work",
    "we go a few steps ahead in the development of our `` envelope - based tp - agb models '' .",
    "we describe a code , called ` colibri ` , that implements a number of improvements which , effectively , make our models to perform much more like `` almost - full '' models than `` improved synthetic '' ones . among the most relevant points we mention : i ) a spherically - symmetric deep envelope model extending from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the quiescent h - burning shell , so that the classical core - mass luminosity relation ( cmlr ) is naturally predicted and not taken as an input prescription ; ii ) the first ever on - the - fly accurate calculation of molecular chemistry and rosseland mean opacities , fully consistent with the changing surface abundances , iii ) a detailed hbb nucleosynthesis coupled with a diffusive description of convection , iv ) a model for the pulse - driven convection zone to predict the chemical composition of the dredged - up material , and v ) improved prescriptions to determine the onset and quenching of the third dredge - up .    of course , in the development of the ` colibri ` code full tp - agb models still play a paramount role : they are taken as a reference to check the accuracy of some basic predictions , and they are used to derive quantitative information , via fitting relations , on those aspects that the ` colibri ` code can not , by construction , address by itself like , for example , the evolution of the intershell convection zone during thermal pulses .    in any case , all these aspects are treated fulfilling two extremely important conditions : a robust numerical stability which allows to follow the tp - agb evolution until the complete ejection of the envelope , and a high computational speed which is kept comparable to the levels that made the success of the very first synthetic tp - agb models . in this way the ` colibri ` code is a tool perfectly suitable to perform a multi - parametric , but still accurate , calibration of the tp - agb phase , our final goal .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_outline ] presents an outline of the ` colibri ` code .",
    "section  [ sec_physmod ] describes in detail all input physics and the solution methods adopted to integrate the deep envelope model , and to predict the nucleosynthesis in the pulse - driven convective zone and during hbb .",
    "section [ sec_synthmod ] summarises the analytic ingredients of ` colibri ` .",
    "accuracy tests of ` colibri ` predictions against full stellar models are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_tests ] .",
    "the present sets of tp - agb evolutionary tracks are introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec_tracks ] , while the whole sect .",
    "[ sec_results ] is dedicated to illustrate several examples of possible ` colibri ` calculations .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "[ sec_finalsum ] closes the paper giving a rsum of ` colibri ` s features , and briefly mentioning current and planned applications .",
    "the ` colibri ` code computes the tp - agb evolution from the first thermal pulse up to the complete ejection of the stellar mantle by stellar winds . while maintaining a few basic features of our original tp - agb model developed and revised over the years @xcite , we have introduced substantial improvements that notably enhance the predictive power of our tp - agb calculations .",
    "the main variables of the tp - agb model , which are also frequently cited in the text , are operatively defined in table  [ tab_mod ] .",
    "` colibri ` consists of three main components , that we conveniently refer to as 1 ) the _ physics module _ ,",
    "2 ) the _ synthetic module _ , and 3 ) the _ parameter box_.    the _ physics module _ involves all detailed input physics ( equation of state , opacities , nuclear reactions rates ) and differential equations necessary to numerically integrate a stationary _ deep envelope model _ , extending from the atmosphere down to the bottom of the h - burning shell ( see sect .  [ sec_physmod ] ) . at each time step",
    ", the run of mass @xmath6 , temperature @xmath7 , pressure @xmath8 , and luminosity @xmath9 is determined across the deep envelope during the quiescent interpulse periods . by adopting proper boundary conditions at the bottom of the convective envelope",
    ", we obtain the effective temperature , and the luminosity provided by the hydrogen burning shell . in this way we are able to follow consistently the occurrence of hbb in the most massive agb stars , being responsible for the break - down of the cmlr ( see sect .  [ ssec_lum ] ) , as well as a significant nucleosynthesis ( see sect .  [ ssec_hbbnuc ] ) .    the _ synthetic module _ contains the analytic formalism of the code , which includes both fitting formulas that synthesize the results of full agb models ( e.g. the core mass - interpulse period relation , the core mass - intershell mass relation , the efficiency of the third dredge - up as a function of stellar mass and metallicity , etc . ) , and other auxiliary relations ( e.g. mass - loss prescription , period - mass - radius relations for variable agb stars , etc . ) .",
    "it is outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec_synthmod ] .    the _ parameters box _ collects all free parameters that we think need to be calibrated ( e.g. minimum base temperature for the occurrence of the third dredge - up , efficiency of mass loss , dependence on mass and metallicity , overshoot at the base of the convective envelope ) in order to reproduce basic observables .",
    "since a fine calibration of the tp - agb phase is not the primary purpose of this paper , the results presented here are obtained with a particular set of parameters , as specified in sect .",
    "[ ssec_tpagbev ] .",
    "these three components clearly represent a sequence of decreasing accuracy , and increasing uncertainty . while for most ingredients of the physics module we rely on detailed and well - established prescriptions , in the synthetic module we have to resort to the results of various sets of full tp - agb models in the literature that share a general agreement , but present also unavodaible differences due to specific model details .",
    "the parameter box , instead , hides a big deal of our ignorance about basic physical processes in agb stars .",
    "the coupling of these components , with very different degrees of accuracy , is inescapable at this point .",
    "the situation resembles the one that persists in practically all full stellar evolutionary codes to date , in which rough descriptions for convective processes  such as the mixing length theory and overshooting  are routinely adopted , and anyhow being able to produce very useful results . although we all know that `` fake physics '' is being used to some extent in all these codes , it is also a matter of fact that , at some stages , these approximations have opened the way for advancing the theory of stellar evolution on other fronts .",
    "our wish is that the same strategy can turn out to be useful also for the tp - agb phase .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for temperatures in the interval from @xmath10  k to @xmath11  k is that of a fully - ionized gas , in the way described by @xcite .    for temperatures in the range from @xmath10  k to @xmath12  k all relevant thermodynamic quantities and their partial derivatives ( mass density , electron density , mean molecular weight , entropy , specific heats , etc .",
    ") are computed _ on - the - fly _ with the ` sopus ` code @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall that ` sopus ` solves the eos for atoms and molecules in the gas phase , under the assumption of an ideal gas in both thermodynamic equilibrium and instantaneous chemical equilibrium .",
    "we consider the ionisation stages from i to v for all elements from c to ni ( up to vi for o and ne ) , and from i to iii for heavier atoms from cu to u. saha equations for ionisation and dissociation are solved for @xmath13 species , including @xmath14 atoms ( neutral and ionised ) from h to u , and @xmath15 molecules .",
    "an example of the eos calculations across the outermost layers of a tp - agb model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_molec ] , that also illustrates the dramatic change in the equilibrium molecular chemistry as the surface c / o ratio passes from @xmath16 , typical of m stars , to @xmath17 , characteristic of c stars .",
    "rosseland mean gas opacities , in the whole temperature range @xmath18 , are computed _ on - the - fly _ , i.e. contemporary with the atmospheric and envelope integrations that constitute the kernel of our tp - agb code .",
    "we remark that this is the _ first time ever _ that accurate opacities are computed on - the - fly , just starting from the monochromatic absorption coefficients of the opacity sources , without interpolation in pre - exiting tables of rosseland mean opacities .",
    "this choice is motivated by the demand of accurately describing the tight coupling of the opacity sources ( mainly in the molecular regime ) with the frequent and significant changes in the envelope chemical composition that characterise the tp - agb phase . in this way",
    "we avoid the loss in accuracy that one must otherwise pay when performing multi - dimensional interpolation .    to this aim",
    "we have constructed a routine which , for any given set of chemical abundances of @xmath19 elements from h to u , and a specified pair of state variables ( e.g. gas pressure @xmath20 and temperature @xmath21 ) , makes direct calls to one of two opacity codes , depending on the temperature :    * the _ opacity project_3.3 open - source package available at the web page http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/topbase/op.html ] ( op ) ( op ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for @xmath22 ; * the ` sopus ` code @xcite for @xmath23 .    the op data provides the monochromatic opacities for several atoms ( h , he , c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , cr , mn , fe , ni ) over a wide range of values of temperature @xmath21 and electron density @xmath24 . we have employed the routines _",
    "mixv.f _ and _ opfit.f _ to calculate the rosseland mean opacities on a pre - determined grid of op@xmath25 meshes and then to interpolate to any specified values of @xmath21 and @xmath26 . since the original op version assumes a fixed mixture of elements ( i.e. scaled - solar chemical composition ) , we have suitably modified the op routines to compute the rosseland mean for any chemical composition involving the @xmath27 species for which the op monochromatic opacities are available .",
    "this is an important improvement compared to the common practice in which the chemical parameters ( besides the h or he abundances ) are limited to few metal abundances .",
    "for instance , the widely - used opal web tool @xcite allows the on - line computation and provides the interpolating routines of rosseland mean opacity tables with a fixed partition of metals , but for the abundances of two species ( e.g. c and o ) , which are enhanced according to a specified grid of values .",
    "we notice that in this case , the possible depletion of a metal , due for instance to nuclear burning , can not be considered . at variance",
    ", the op utility gives us an important flexibility in this respect .",
    "suitably converted into an internal routine of our ` colibri ` code , for each pair of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , ` sopus ` calculates the monochromatic true absorption and scattering cross sections due to a number of continuum and discrete processes , i.e. bound - free absorption due to photoionisation , free - free absorption , rayleigh and thomson scattering , collision - induced absorption , atomic bound - bound absorption and molecular absorption .",
    "we note that the monochromatic cross sections for atoms ( c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , cr , mn , fe , ni ) are taken from the op database , thus assuring a complete consistency with the high - temperature opacities .",
    "then , after summing up all contributions , the rosseland mean ( rm ) opacity is computed .",
    "the incorporation of ` sopus ` in the ` colibri ` code allows us to follow accurately the changes in molecular opacities driven by any variation of the envelope composition , especially by the c / o ratio which plays the key role in determining the molecular chemistry ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the complex behaviour of the rm opacities as a function of the c / o ratio is exemplified with the aid of fig .",
    "[ fig_opac ] .",
    "it turns out that while the c / o ratio increases from @xmath28 to @xmath29 the opacity bump peaking at ( @xmath30 )  mostly due to h@xmath31o  becomes more and more depressed because of the smaller availability of o atoms .",
    "then , passing from c / o  @xmath32 up to c / o  @xmath33 the h@xmath31o feature actually disappears and @xmath34 drastically drops by more almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , at this c / o value the chemistry enters in a transition region where most of both o and c atoms are trapped in the very stable co molecule at the expense of the other molecular species , belonging to both the o- and c - bearing groups . at c / o  @xmath35 the rm opacity reaches its minimum throughout the temperature range , @xmath36 , while a sudden upturn is expected as soon as c / o slightly exceeds unity , as displayed by the curve for c / o  @xmath37 of fig .",
    "[ fig_opac ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this fact reflects the drastic change in the molecular equilibria from the o- to the c - dominated regime .",
    "then , at increasing c / o the opacity curves move upward following a more gradual trend , which is related to the strengthening of the c - bearing molecular absorption bands",
    ".    note , however , that the c - rich opacity does not rise linearly with c / o , but less and less steeply as the c / o ratio increases .",
    "this is mainly due to the underlying equilibrium chemistry of the most efficient absorbers , in particular of the cn and hcn molecules , whose abundances are conditioned not only by the carbon excess ( c - o ) , but also by the availability of the n atoms ( having a fixed abundance in the case under consideration ) . as we will see in sect .",
    "[ ssec_hayashi ] , the non - linear dependence of the opacity on the c / o ratio impacts on the maximum extension of the hayashi lines for c stars towards lower effective temperatures .",
    "our nuclear network consists of the p - p chains , the cno tri - cycle , and the ne - na , mg - al chains , and the most important @xmath38-capture reactions , including explicitly @xmath39 chemical species : @xmath40h , @xmath41h , @xmath42he , @xmath43he , @xmath44li , @xmath44be , @xmath45c , @xmath46c , @xmath47n , @xmath48n , @xmath49o , @xmath50o , @xmath51o , @xmath52f , @xmath53ne , @xmath54ne , @xmath55ne , @xmath56na , @xmath57 mg , @xmath58 mg , @xmath59 mg , @xmath59al@xmath60 , @xmath59al@xmath61 , @xmath62al , @xmath63si .",

    "a fundamental check is to compare our determination of the effective temperatures , based on envelope integrations ( @xmath65 ; the method is detailed in sect .",
    "[ ssec_envmod ] ) , against the results of full stellar models ( @xmath66 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_dtefz01 ] we show the results for the set of stellar evolutionary tracks with initial chemical composition ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) , computed with ` parsec ` @xcite . in the top panel",

    "we can already see that the agreement is very good for all stellar masses here considered .",
    "we also note that @xmath65 is systematically lower than @xmath66 by a small amount , which appears to increase somewhat with the stellar mass .",
    "considering that part of the differences is likely due to unavoidable numerical effects impossible to be disentangled , we have also investigated other possible physical causes that may explain some systematic trends .",
    "in particular we have considered the effects due to different descriptions of the eos and the opacities in the ` parsec ` and ` colibri ` codes .    in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_dtefz01 ] we zoom in the difference @xmath70 ( in @xmath71 degrees ) , as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "the three sequences are obtained with three combinations of the eos and low-@xmath21 opacities used in the ` colibri ` code . the lowest sequence ( black empty triangles ) , showing the largest deviations from ` parsec ` , corresponds to the @xmath65 predictions with the optimal configuration of all input physics in ` colibri ` .",
    "specifically , envelope integrations have been carried out with both the eos and the rosseland mean opacities computed with ` sopus ` on - the - fly according to the actual chemical mixture of all elements .",

    "in contrast , in ` parsec ` the opacities are derived through interpolations on pre - computed opacity tables as a function of temperature , density , hydrogen abundance , and current metallicity @xmath74 , while keeping the distribution of metals fixed to the initial configuration , @xmath75 . in particular",
    "this means that that no change in the c / o ratio is considered , i.e. @xmath76 is assumed in all opacity tables .    to test the effect produced on the effective temperatures by low-@xmath21 opacities with a fixed chemical partition",

    ", we note that larger deviations from @xmath100 are found at larger stellar masses ( @xmath101 ) where hbb starts to be operative .",

    "<S> this allows to predict self - consistently : ( i ) the effective temperature , and more generally the _ convective envelope and atmosphere structures _ , correctly coupled to the changes in the surface chemical abundances and gas opacities ; ( ii ) the conditions under which _ sphericity effects _ may significantly affect the atmospheres of giant stars ; ( iii ) the _ core mass - luminosity relation and its possible break - down due to the occurrence of hot bottom burning _ </S>",
    "<S> ( hbb ) in the most massive agb stars , by taking properly into account the nuclear energy generation in the h - burning shell and in the deepest layers of the convective envelope ; ( iv ) the _ hbb nucleosynthesis _ via the solution of a complete nuclear network ( including the pp chains , and </S>",
    "<S> the cno , nena , mgal cycles ) coupled to a diffusive description of mixing , suitable to follow also the synthesis of @xmath0li via the cameron - fowler beryllium transport mechanism ; ( v ) the _ intershell abundances _ left by each thermal pulse via the solution of a complete nuclear network applied to a simple model of the pulse - driven convective zone ; ( vi ) the _ onset and quenching of the third dredge - up _ , with a temperature criterion that is applied , at each thermal pulse , to the result of envelope integrations at the stage of the post - flash luminosity peak .    at the same time ` colibri ` pioneers new techniques in the treatment of the physics of stellar interiors , not yet adopted in full tp - agb models . </S>",
    "<S> it is the first evolutionary code ever to use accurate _ on - the - fly _ computation of the _ equation of state _ for roughly 800 atoms , ions , molecules , and of the rosseland mean _ opacities _ throughout the atmosphere and the deep envelope . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures a complete consistency , step by step , of both eos and opacity with the evolution of the chemical abundances caused by the third dredge - up and hbb . </S>",
    "<S> another distinguishing aspect of ` colibri ` is its high computational speed , that allows to generate complete grids of tp - agb models in just a few hours . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is absolutely necessary for calibrating the many uncertain parameters and processes that characterize the tp - agb phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the many unique features of ` colibri ` by means of detailed evolutionary tracks computed for several choices of model parameters , including initial star masses , chemical abundances , nuclear reaction rates , efficiency of the third dredge - up , overshooting at the base of the pulse - driven convection zone , etc . </S>",
    "<S> future papers in this series will deal with the calibration of all these and other parameters using observational data of agb stars in the galaxy and in nearby systems , a step that is of paramount importance for producing reliable stellar population synthesis models of galaxies up to high redshift .    </S>",
