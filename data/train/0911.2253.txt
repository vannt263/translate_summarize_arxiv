    "a personal note from corinne : during the academic year 1986/87 , tevian and i were living in york , newly married and young postdocs .",
    "tevian was working in the mathematics department there , doing research in general relativity , and i was working in durham , with david fairlie , just beginning my research into the octonionic structures reported here .",
    "imagine my pleasure , when i found out that york had its own resident expert on the octonions !",
    "i returned to york the following summer , to work with tony on an attempt to describe the superstring using octonions  @xcite .",
    "i will be forever grateful to him , not only for the generous way in which he shared his vast knowledge and experience in this field , but also for the friendship , respect , collegiality , and mentorship , which he also generously shared .",
    "in the dirac formulation of quantum mechanics , a quantum mechanical state is represented by a _ complex _",
    "vector @xmath3 , often written as @xmath4 , which is usually normalized such that @xmath5 . in the jordan formulation  @xcite , the same state is instead represented by the hermitian matrix @xmath6 , also written as @xmath7 , which squares to itself and has trace @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix @xmath6 is thus the projection operator for the state @xmath3 , which can also be viewed as a pure state in the density matrix formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "note that the usual phase freedom in @xmath3 is no longer present in @xmath6 , which is uniquely determined by the state ( and the normalization condition ) .",
    "a fundamental object in the dirac formalism is the probability amplitude @xmath9 , or @xmath10 , which is not however measurable ; it is the squared norm @xmath11 of the probability amplitude which yields measurable probabilities .",
    "one of the basic observations which leads to the jordan formalism is that these probabilities can be expressed entirely in terms of the jordan product of projection operators , since @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the _ jordan product _  @xcite @xmath14 which is commutative but not associative .",
    "remarkably , the jordan formulation of quantum mechanics does not require ( @xmath3 and ) @xmath15 to be complex , but only that the _",
    "jordan identity _",
    "@xmath16 hold for two hermitian matrices @xmath15 and @xmath17 . as shown in  @xcite , the jordan identity  ( [ jid ] ) is equivalent to power associativity , which ensures that arbitrary powers of jordan matrices  and hence of quantum mechanical observables  are well - defined .",
    "the jordan identity  ( [ jid ] ) is the defining property of a _",
    "jordan algebra _",
    "@xcite , and is clearly satisfied if the operator algebra is associative , which will be the case if the elements of the hermitian matrices @xmath15 , @xmath17 themselves lie in an associative algebra",
    ". remarkably , one further possibility exists , for which the elements of the hermitian matrices do _ not _ lie in an associative algebra .",
    "this example is the albert algebra ( also called the exceptional jordan algebra ) @xmath18 of @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices  @xcite .",
    "octonionic hermitian matrices @xmath19 also form a jordan algebra , but , even though the octonions are not associative , it is possible to find an associative algebra that leads to the same jordan algebra  @xcite . ] in what follows we will restrict our attention to this exceptional case . ) fails ; it is the right - hand side which provides the correct generalization . ]",
    "the hurwitz theorem states that the real numbers @xmath20 , complexes @xmath21 , quaternions @xmath22 , and octonions @xmath23 are the _ only _ ( normed ) division algebras ( over the real numbers ) . ) which is also a _ ring with identity _ under multiplication , and in which @xmath24 can be uniquely solved for @xmath25 ( unless @xmath26 ) .",
    "a _ normed _ division algebra satisfies  ( [ norm ] ) in addition , and is therefore also an _ integral domain _ , that is , a ring in which @xmath27 implies @xmath26 or @xmath28 . ] the quaternions and octonions are extensions of the familiar real and complex numbers .",
    "a quaternion is an arbitrary real linear combination of the real identity element @xmath8 and three different square roots of minus one , which are conventionally called @xmath29 and satisfy the multiplication table given in figure  [ qmult ] .",
    "similarly , the octonions are formed from seven square roots of minus one which we will call @xmath30 , whose multiplication table is summarized in figure  [ omult ] . in these multiplication tables , each point corresponds to an imaginary unit .",
    "each line or circle corresponds to a quaternionic triple with the arrow giving the orientation .",
    "for example , @xmath31 and each of these products anticommutes , that is , reversing the order contributes a minus sign .",
    ".,height=288 ]    we define the _ conjugate _",
    "@xmath32 of a quaternion or octonion @xmath33 as the ( real ) linear map which reverses the sign of each imaginary unit .",
    "thus , if @xmath34 then @xmath35 direct computation shows that @xmath36 the _ norm _ @xmath37 of an octonion @xmath33 is defined by @xmath38 the only octonion with norm @xmath39 is @xmath39 , and every nonzero octonion has a unique inverse , namely @xmath40 for all the normed division algebras , the norm satisfies the identity @xmath41    a remarkable property of the octonions is that they are _ not _ associative ! for example , compare @xmath42 however , the octonions are _ alternative _ , that is , products involving no more than 2 independent octonions do associate .",
    "the _ commutator _ of two octonions @xmath33 , @xmath43 is given as usual by @xmath44 = ab - ba\\ ] ] and we define the _ associator _ of three octonions @xmath33 , @xmath43 , @xmath45 by @xmath46 = ( ab)c - a(bc)\\ ] ] which quantifies the lack of associativity .",
    "more generally , both the commutator and associator are _ antisymmetric _ , that is , interchanging any two arguments changes the result by a minus sign ; replacing any argument by its conjugate has the same effect , because the real parts do nt contribute to the associator .",
    "the units @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are by no means the only square roots of @xmath54 .",
    "rather , _ any _ pure imaginary quaternion or octonion squares to a negative number , so it is only necessary to choose its norm to be @xmath8 in order to get a square root of @xmath54 .",
    "the imaginary quaternions of norm  @xmath8 form a 2-sphere in the 3-dimensional space of imaginary quaternions .",
    "the imaginary octonions of norm  @xmath8 form a 6-sphere in the 7-dimensional space of imaginary octonions .",
    "any such unit imaginary quaternion or octonion @xmath55 can be used to construct a complex subalgebra of @xmath22 or @xmath23 , which we will also denote by @xmath21 , and which takes the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 . regarding @xmath55 as the complex unit",
    ", we have the familiar euler identity @xmath58 so that _ any _ quaternion or octonion can be written in the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 any _ two _ unit imaginary octonions @xmath55 and @xmath61 that point in independent directions determine a _ quaternionic _ subalgebra of @xmath23 .",
    "the freedom to choose an entire or of square roots of minus one within the space of the pure imaginary quaternions or the space of pure imaginary octonions leads one to investigate the transformations that preserve the corresponding multiplication table .",
    "these transformations form the automorphism group of the corresponding division algebra .    in the case of the quaternions ,",
    "one can imagine rotating @xmath47 to any pure imaginary point on the ( 2 degrees of freedom ) . then @xmath48 can be chosen to be any direction perpendicular to the direction of @xmath47 , i.e.  on the equator of the resulting ( 1 degree of freedom ) .",
    "the direction of @xmath49 is determined by the multiplication table .",
    "the automorphism group of the quaternions is therefore seen to be @xmath64 .    for the octonions",
    ", one can again imagine rotating @xmath47 to any pure imaginary point on the ( 6 degrees of freedom ) . then @xmath48 must again be perpendicular to @xmath47 ( 5 degrees of freedom ) and the direction of @xmath49 is fixed by the multiplication table . but @xmath53 is now free to be any direction perpendicular to all of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 directions ( 3 degrees of freedom ) and the directions of the remaining units are determined by the multiplication table .",
    "this lie group turns out to be the exceptional group @xmath62 .",
    "another way of envisioning the transformations in the group @xmath62 was first shown to us by sudbery  @xcite .",
    "consider the octonionic unit @xmath50 at the top of the multiplication table shown in figure  [ flip1 ] .",
    "there are three pairs of octonionic units that form quaternionic subalgebras with @xmath50 , i.e.  @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we call these the pairs that `` point to '' @xmath50 .",
    "if the elements of two of these pairs are rotated into one another oppositely , for instance , if the @xmath65-plane is rotated by an angle @xmath68 , and the @xmath66-plane is rotated by the angle @xmath69 , then it turns out that the multiplication table is preserved .",
    "we have thus constructed a 1-parameter family of automorphisms .",
    "there are three ways of pairing up the three pairs of units in this way , but only two are independent .",
    "since there are 7 different units that can be pointed to , the dimension of this group is again 14 .    .",
    "these transformations are also contained in the preferred @xmath63 that fixes @xmath53.,height=288 ]    in what follows , we will need not only @xmath62 , but also @xmath63 , the subgroup of @xmath62 that fixes one of the octonionic units . since @xmath53 is in the middle of our multiplication table , we will , without loss of generality , choose it to be the unit that is fixed .",
    "we see that the @xmath62 transformation in figure  [ flip1 ] fixes @xmath53 and is therefore in @xmath63 , but a @xmath62 transformation involving either of the other two pairs that point to @xmath50 will not fix @xmath53 . to be symmetric , we choose the linear combination of transformations shown in figure  [ flip2 ] ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 both rotate by @xmath68 and @xmath67",
    "rotates by @xmath70 ) to be the @xmath62 transformation that points to @xmath50 that is _ not _ in @xmath63 . if we choose to point in turn to each of the six units that are _ not _",
    "@xmath53 , we have six @xmath62 transformations that are in @xmath63 and six that are not . what about the remaining two @xmath62 transformations",
    "? these are transformations that point to @xmath53 .",
    "one such transformation , shown in figure  [ lfix ] , rotates @xmath71 by @xmath68 and @xmath72 by @xmath69 .",
    "there are three transformations of this type , all of which fix @xmath53 and are therefore elements of @xmath63 , but only two are linearly independent .",
    "any two of these transformations complete the 8-dimensional lie group @xmath63 .    .",
    "these transformations are not contained in the preferred @xmath63 that fixes @xmath53.,height=288 ]    .",
    "these transformations are contained in the preferred @xmath63 that fixes @xmath53.,height=288 ]    yet another way to describe @xmath62 is in terms of _ inner automorphisms _ , that is , transformations of the form @xmath73 inner automorphisms always preserve an associative multiplication rule , since @xmath74 however , this condition is nontrivial over the octonions , since the parentheses can not be moved . as shown in  @xcite ,  ( [ inner ] ) holds for all @xmath75 if and only if @xmath33 is a sixth root of unity .",
    "that is , the inner automorphisms of the octonions are given by  ( [ conjugate ] ) where @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath55 is any pure imaginary unit octonion .",
    "as further discussed in  @xcite , any @xmath62 transformation can in fact be generated by a finite sequence of nested transformations of the form  ( [ conjugate ] ) , with @xmath33 given by  ( [ root ] ) .",
    "in previous work  @xcite , we solved the _ jordan eigenvalue problem _ , namely the eigenmatrix problem @xmath78 where @xmath15 and @xmath79 are both @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrices .",
    "unlike the right eigenvalue problem @xmath80 considered in  @xcite , the jordan eigenvalue problem  ( [ jeigen ] ) admits only real eigenvalues , which do solve the characteristic equation for @xmath15 , namely  @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the identity matrix , @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 the operation @xmath85 denotes the freudenthal product @xmath86 and the determinant is defined unambiguously by @xmath87 the jordan and freudenthal products are generalizations of the standard dot and cross products .",
    "just as in the more familiar complex case , normalized eigenmatrices for each nondegenerate eigenvalue are primitive idempotents , and the degenerate case can be handled using gram - schmidt orthogonalization .",
    "furthermore , each primitive idempotent is in fact an element of the _ cayley - moufang plane _ @xmath88 , which can be characterized as @xmath89 it is straightforward to show from the first condition in ( [ op2 ] ) that the components of any element @xmath90 must lie in some quaternionic subalgebra of @xmath23 , which of course depends on @xmath79 .",
    "put differently , the associator of the ( independent , off - diagonal ) components of @xmath79 , denoted @xmath91 $ ] , must vanish .",
    "but quaternionic primitive idempotents have ( nonunique ) `` square roots '' , @xmath92 , so that we can also write @xmath93=0 , \\psi^\\dagger\\psi=1\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 $ ] denotes the associator of the components of @xmath95 .",
    "we refer to such 3-component octonionic column vectors @xmath95 as _ cayley spinors_.    putting this all together , any @xmath0 octonionic hermitian matrix @xmath15 can be expressed as the sum of the squares of quaternionic columns , which are orthogonal under the jordan product , that is @xmath96 in terms of primitive idempotents @xmath97 and their corresponding eigenvalues @xmath98 .",
    "the automorphism group of the jordan product  ( [ jprod ] ) ( and consequently also of the freudenthal product  ( [ fprod ] ) ) is the exceptional group @xmath99 , and the group which leaves the determinant  ( [ det ] ) invariant is a particular real form of the exceptional group @xmath1 .",
    "these groups can be interpreted as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as we now show ; for further details see  @xcite .    in previous work  @xcite , manogue and",
    "schray showed how to write the ( double cover of the ) lorentz group @xmath102 as @xmath103 , with the action given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , the @xmath2 hermitian matrices with octonionic components .",
    "the key to that work was to give an explicit set of basis transformations  the rotations and boosts in coordinate planes  which were _ compatible _ with the spinor representation in the sense that if @xmath106 transforms like @xmath107 then there are no associativity problems in the vector transformation @xmath108    any such basis transformation @xmath109 can be immediately reinterpreted as a @xmath0 transformation @xmath110 via @xmath111 and it is straightforward to verify that any such @xmath110 preserves the determinant of @xmath112 and is therefore an element of @xmath1 .",
    "how many such transformations are there ?",
    "we first give the basis transformations for the simpler case of @xmath113 , adapted from  @xcite and rewritten as elements of @xmath1 .",
    "when interpreting these transformations , it is helpful to recall that , in this case , @xmath114 we have the three rotations @xmath115 @xmath116 and the three boosts @xmath117 @xmath118 written in terms of the single imaginary unit @xmath53 . to generate a @xmath0 representation of @xmath103 , start by replacing @xmath53 in turn by each of the other imaginary units , yielding 18 new transformations , for a total of 24 .",
    "the remaining 21 transformations in @xmath103 are precisely the rotations of the imaginary units with each other , which make up an @xmath119 ( really @xmath120 ; we are being casual about double covers ) .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , these rotations are obtained by _ nesting _ , that is by transformations of the form @xmath121 where each corresponding @xmath122 represents a `` flip '' , that is , a pure imaginary multiple of the ( @xmath2 ! )  identity matrix .",
    "thus , a typical @xmath110 takes the form @xmath123 where it is important to note that @xmath110 is _ not _ a multiple of the ( @xmath0 ) identity matrix .",
    "we are now ready to count the basis transformations of @xmath1 . at first sight",
    ", it appears we have three copies of @xmath103  simply repeat the embedding  ( [ typei ] ) with the two other obvious block structures .",
    "we call these three copies type i , ii , and iii",
    ". however , this yields @xmath124 transformations , and , while these transformations do indeed generate all of @xmath1 , it is clear that they can not be a basis , since the dimension of @xmath1 is only @xmath125 .",
    "let s try again .",
    "each of these three copies of @xmath126 contains a copy of @xmath127 . a famous property of @xmath127 called _ triality _",
    "asserts in this context that these three copies of @xmath127 in fact consist of the same @xmath1 transformations ( but labeled differently ) , so we should count these copies only once . but @xmath127 has 28 elements , to which we must add 3 copies of the @xmath128 rotations needed to get to @xmath129 , then 3 copies of the @xmath130 boosts needed to get to @xmath102 , resulting in @xmath131 transformations .",
    "a bit of thought reveals that the 3 copies of the @xmath132-boost  ( [ tzboost ] ) are not independent ; removing one of them correctly yields an explicit set of @xmath125 basis transformations for @xmath1 , also justifying the interpretation @xmath101 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , due to triality , only the 14 @xmath62 transformations need to be written in the nested form  ( [ nest ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the remaining 14 @xmath127 transformations can all be expressed using the type i transformation  ( [ rz ] ) and its types ii and iii variants .",
    "the former are just the usual 7 rotations needed to get from @xmath119 to @xmath127 , but the latter yield an unnested description of the 7 non-@xmath62 transformations in @xmath119 , which take the form @xmath133 each of these transformations rotates 3 octonionic planes by the same amount , and can therefore be thought of as a `` phase '' transformation .",
    "what about @xmath99 ?",
    "note that we have described @xmath134 boosts , and @xmath135 rotations .",
    "so our @xmath1 is the real representation with 26 boosts , commonly written as @xmath136 , with the number in parentheses denoting the number of boosts minus the number of rotations .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath99 preserves the trace of elements of @xmath18 , corresponding to the timelike direction ; this is the compact representation of @xmath99 , consisting precisely of the rotation subgroup of this real form of @xmath1 .",
    "these considerations justify the interpretation @xmath100 .    returning to the characteristic equation  ( [ char ] ) , not only",
    "does @xmath1 preserve the determinant , it also preserves the condition @xmath137 .",
    "but these two coefficients control the number of nonzero eigenvalues  3 if @xmath138 , 2 if @xmath139 , and 1 if @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath1 preserves the number of nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath15 , and hence the number of terms in the decomposition  ( [ decomp ] ) with nonzero eigenvalue .",
    "in order to apply this formalism to elementary particle physics , we break the full symmetry and explore how a jordan matrix transforms under various subgroups of @xmath1 .",
    "one such symmetry breaking occurs when we choose a preferred @xmath103 subgroup of @xmath141 , as in  ( [ typei ] ) .",
    "this leads us to impose a block structure on @xmath18 , so that @xmath142 where @xmath143 transforms like a 10-dimensional momentum vector , @xmath144 transforms like a ( majorana - weyl ) spinor , and @xmath145 is a scalar .",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath146 where tilde denotes trace reversal , that is , @xmath147 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the massless , momentum - space dirac equation in 10 dimensions can be written @xmath148 which implies the nonlinear constraint @xmath149 the general solution of ( [ dirac ] ) and ( [ massless ] ) is of the form @xmath150 where the components of @xmath106 lie in the complex subalgebra of @xmath23 determined by @xmath151 and @xmath152 is arbitrary . using  ( [ star ] ) ,",
    "these equations are seen to be precisely the same as @xmath153 where @xmath154 thus , ( normalized ) solutions of the dirac equation are precisely elements of @xmath88 , and therefore the squares of cayley spinors .    in previous work  @xcite , we discussed solutions of the dirac equation in the form  ( [ dirac ] ) . remembering that solutions of  ( [ diracstar ] ) are quaternionic , and reducing 10 spacetime dimensions to 4 by the simple expedient of choosing a preferred complex subalgebra of @xmath23 , we used spin eigenstates and particle / antiparticle projection operators as usual to identify particle states within our division algebra formalism .",
    "this procedure identified a spin-@xmath155 massive particle with two spin states , namely @xmath156 where the direction of the arrow indicates the @xmath157-component of the spin , and where the second equality in each case gives the momentum vector .",
    "comparison with  ( [ vector ] ) shows that the @xmath25 , @xmath158 , and @xmath157 components of the momentum vanish ; these states are given at rest .",
    "similarly , there is an analogous antiparticle with two spin states .",
    "the procedure also identified a left - handed massless particle , which when moving in the @xmath157-direction takes the form @xmath159 together with a massless particle of the opposite helicity , which when moving in the @xmath157-direction takes the form @xmath160 any other 2-component quaternionic column can be identified as an appropriately rotated and/or boosted superposition of these particles in the usual way .",
    "noting that the first two particles carry an octonionic label ( @xmath49 ) , it is straightforward to generalize these particles to 3 generations of leptons , labeled by @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; the remaining particle does not have an octonionic label .",
    "thus , an octonionic description of the dirac equation in 10 dimensions yields a particle spectrum containing precisely 3 generations of leptons , each with a single - helicity , massless neutrino , together with a single `` sterile '' neutrino of the opposite helicity but with no generation structure .",
    "we have shown how to break the symmetry group @xmath1 so that a lorentzian @xmath161 dimensional momentum space emerges , together with internal symmetries that describe the correct spin / helicity transformations on cayley spinors to describe leptons .",
    "furthermore , precisely three generations of such leptons exist which respect the octonionic structure of the transformations .",
    "contained naturally within this description of leptons and their symmetries are three massless left - handed neutrinos and a single , sterile , right - handed neutrino .",
    "we have learned several important lessons along the way .",
    "first , in spite of the non - commutativity and non - associativity of the octonions , everything that one might want to do can be made to work if one defines everything carefully .",
    "second , when working with the octonions , it is important to make the lie group structure primary , rather than the lie algebra structure . some of the nested group transformations described in ( [ nest ] ) can not be described in terms of the exponentials of any lie algebra transformations .",
    "finally , in order to keep a complex structure on the lie algebra from interfering with the octonionic units in the matrices , it is important in the symmetry - breaking process to look at _ real _ lie subalgebras rather than complexified ones .",
    "we call the reader s attention to the recent work of aaron wangberg  @xcite , in which the important real forms of the subgroups of @xmath1 were identified , using a division - algebra perspective",
    ". a map of these subgroups , taken from  @xcite , appears in figure  [ e6map ] .",
    ", taken from  @xcite . ]",
    "we conclude with several speculative questions :    1 .   in this paper , we have described leptons in terms of `` 1-squares , '' i.e.  the squares of cayley spinors .",
    "but the most general octonionic hermitian matrix can be a linear combination of up to three such squares .",
    "is it possible to describe the meson and baryon sectors of standard particle physics as `` 2-squares '' and `` 3-squares , '' respectively ? 2 .",
    "does the group @xmath1 , broken in the way we have discussed , describe both the standard model interactions and lorentz transformations in @xmath161-dimensions ?",
    "3 .   after the symmetry",
    "breaking described in section  [ breaking ] , some of the lie group transformations of the form  ( [ conjugate ] ) ,  ( [ root ] ) are no longer connected to the identity .",
    "do these discrete transformations correspond to discrete conserved quantities such as charge ?",
