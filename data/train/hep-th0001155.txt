    "classical supersymmetry sets out to extend the unified treatment of bosonic and fermionic quantities in the usual qft framework to the classical level .",
    "normally , in semiclassical treatments the fermionic variables are set to zero as soon as the supersymmetric theory has been constructed .",
    "the usual argument goes that since we can not find classical fermions in nature , fermionic quantities should be omitted altogether at the classical level .    however , this is far from necessary .",
    "in fact , a consistent approach to classical supersymmetry has long been available  for a review see e.g. the book by de witt @xcite .",
    "fermionic quantities are then treated as anticommuting variables taking values in a grassmann algebra @xmath1 .",
    "grassmann - valued mechanics has been analysed in the works of berezin and marinov @xcite and casalbuoni @xcite and later by junker and matthiesen @xcite .",
    "a main difference to our work is that both @xcite and @xcite do not distinguish clearly between generators of the algebra and dynamical quantities and thus define the grassmann algebra @xmath1 rather implicitly .",
    "the fact that the bosonic variables take values in the even part of the same algebra @xmath1 is not apparent in these works , although both recognize that the bosonic variables can not be real functions anymore  without , however , elaborating on this fact .",
    "a central aim of this paper is therefore to make sense of the _ general _ grassmann - valued equations of motion , including the fermionic ones , and to find ways to their solution , which is done in @xcite and @xcite only in very special cases .",
    "junker and matthiesen , who investigate a similar mechanical model , achieve a more general solution than in @xcite and @xcite , but again under the ( implicit ) assumption that the grassmann algebra is spanned by only two generators identified with the fermionic dynamical variables .",
    "we can confirm most of their results ( in different form , though , due to a different choice of variables ) as special cases of our solutions .",
    "however , we disagree about some details , in particular , concerning the case of zero energy .    the mechanical model that we study here is the supersymmetric motion of a particle in a one - dimensional potential , derived by dimensional reduction from the usual @xmath2 supersymmetric @xmath3-dimensional field theory with yukawa interaction .",
    "a slightly different version of this model was investigated in @xcite , where a different concept of reality was used that led to a negative potential in the lagrangian .",
    "the approach taken here stays closer to the usual case with the positive potential .",
    "an important result of @xcite was that a complete solution for the particle motion could be found on the assumption that the underlying algebra @xmath1 has only two generators .",
    "this led to relatively simple results , however is unnecessarily restrictive .    here",
    "we show first that for a large class of potentials the solution to the equations of motion can be found for any @xmath1 and depends only on a small number of @xmath1-valued constants of integration , one of which is a grassmann energy @xmath4 .    to deal with essentially arbitrary potentials we adopt a second method which is closer to that of @xcite , although we need not restrict ourselves to two generators : choosing the grassmann algebra to be finitely generated , with @xmath5 generators , we split all dynamical quantities and equations into their real components , named according to the number of generators involved in the corresponding monomial .",
    "then , beginning from the zeroth order equation , which can be seen as a form of newton s equation , we subsequently work our way up to higher and higher orders , utilizing the solutions already found for the lower levels .",
    "this layer - by - layer strategy allows us to solve the equations of motion for any potential with reasonable mathematical properties .",
    "the existence of a complete solution to the coupled system of equations of motion looks surprising in view of the increasingly large number of equations involved for large @xmath5 .",
    "however , on second thoughts it is not so unexpected : due to our first solution method we know that a full grassmann solution can be found in many cases , the decomposition of which should give us exactly the component solutions obtained by the second method  which it does indeed as we shall demonstrate .",
    "a final word has to be said about the assumption of only a finite number of generators since it has been claimed that this must necessarily lead to contradictions : emphasizing that our paper deals with the _ classical _ theory we do not find this to be true .",
    "we begin our analysis in section [ susymechanics ] by presenting the lagrangian and the equations of motion that we will be concerned with in this paper .",
    "essential for solving these equations are the symmetries and associated noether charges of the lagrangian which we therefore examine in section [ grassmannsymmetries ] . for a certain class of potential functions , namely those for which a particular integral can be calculated analytically , we describe in section [ solfixpot ] how the equations of motion can be solved completely and illustrate this method for two exemplary potentials , the harmonic potential @xmath6 and the hyperbolic potential @xmath7 .",
    "sections [ finite algebra ] and [ solarbpot ] are devoted to the description of our layer - by - layer method which is then explicitly carried out up to fourth order , and illustrated by the harmonic oscillator case in section [ harmpot ] .",
    "next , we investigate the symmetries in component form in section [ symmetries ] : while all component charges can be simply derived by decomposing the original charges , they also reflect a huge number of symmetries of the highest order component lagrangian by which they can be found using noether s procedure .",
    "in addition to the symmetries known from the original lagrangian there appear extra classes of symmetries which can not be related to the former .",
    "it is possible to trace them back to invariance under certain changes of base in the grassmann algebra , viewed as a @xmath8-dimensional vector space .",
    "one question that immediately arises from the decomposition of the physical quantities into components is addressed in section [ interpret ] : how must we interpret the numerous new functions that arise from this procedure ? utilizing the new symmetries found in section [ symmetries ] we offer a geometric interpretation for the lowest order bosonic and fermionic functions and describe the three basic types of motion possible for them .",
    "the higher order quantities are interpreted here from a different point of view : we see them as variations of the lower order quantities with respect to the integration constants involved in these functions , namely an initial time @xmath9 and the    in section [ specialtypesofmotion ] we apply our results to study general oscillatory motion , by which we mean that the lowest order bosonic function is periodic .",
    "the characteristic appearance of linear - periodic terms is explained from both a physical and mathematical perspective employing results of floquet theory .",
    "again , we choose a particular potential to illustrate this in section [ hyperbolpot ] , which allows us also to show that the two solution methods presented in this paper coincide .",
    "a common restriction on both methods is that the energy @xmath10 of the system must be positive , therefore the zero energy case has to be discussed separately .",
    "we do this in section [ zeroenergy ] .",
    "some ideas for further generalization and analysis conclude this paper .",
    "we start our discussion with the standard lagrangian density for @xmath3-dimensional supersymmetric field theory with yukawa interaction : @xmath11 containing a real bosonic scalar field @xmath12 , a real two - component fermionic spinor field @xmath13 and a potential function @xmath14 ; @xmath15 are the light cone derivatives @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 and the two components of @xmath13 take their values in the real even and odd part , respectively , of an arbitrary grassmann algebra @xmath1 , and that the potential function @xmath14 can be expanded into a power series in @xmath12 with real coefficients .",
    "complex conjugation is defined such that @xmath17 in accordance with the conventions in @xcite so that the lagrangian density is a real function despite the @xmath18-factors that occur in front of the fermion terms . as we are dealing with the classical case we assume further that all fields and their derivatives commute or anticommute , depending in the usual way on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the fields .    in this paper",
    "we shall be interested only in spatially independent fields , i.e. @xmath19 . as the fields are then functions of time only this leads us directly from field theory to mechanics .",
    "it is therefore sensible to think of the bosonic field @xmath12 as describing the one - dimensional motion of a particle in the potential @xmath20 . to support this notion we will change the variable @xmath12 to @xmath21 for the rest of this paper .",
    "we then obtain the following lagrange function : @xmath22 where the dot denotes a time derivative and @xmath23 means the derivative of @xmath24 with respect to @xmath21 . performing a formal variation of this lagrangian with respect to the variables @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and neglecting total time derivatives we derive the equations of motion for the system : @xmath27 there is a slight ambiguity in these equations if the grassmann algebra is finitely generated and has an odd number of generators .",
    "then the two equations for the fermion variables will be determined only up to an arbitrary function of highest order in the grassmann algebra .",
    "we can think of this as a gauge degree of freedom and will come back to this point later .    in order to solve the equations it is advisable to understand the symmetries of the system first .",
    "this we will do in the next section .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the lagrangian has no explicit time dependence .",
    "we therefore have invariance under time translation , leading to a conserved hamiltonian as the corresponding noether charge .",
    "this we calculate to be @xmath28 its conserved value we call the energy , denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "note , however , that this hamiltonian is an even grassmann - valued function and that therefore the conserved energy @xmath4 is an even element of @xmath1 .",
    "the operator @xmath29 generates time translations , and acts on the dynamical variables in the obvious way : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an infinitesimal even grassmann parameter .",
    "in addition to time translation invariance there are two further independent symmetries of the lagrangian , relating fermions and bosons .",
    "these can be written in infinitesimal form as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary infinitesimal odd grassmann parameter .",
    "these transformations lead only to a change in the lagrangian by a total time derivative .",
    "we can therefore apply noether s procedure and find the following charges : @xmath34 the conservation of which can be easily shown using the equations of motion .",
    "note that the charges are odd elements of the grassmann algebra .    as for time",
    "translation invariance we now define two operators @xmath35and @xmath36  generating the two symmetry transformations . from ( [ susy transformation ] ) we can read off the action of these operators on the dynamical variables : @xmath37    using the action of the operators on @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 we find that @xmath35 , @xmath36  and @xmath29 form a closed algebra with the relations @xmath38 as long as the equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "notice that @xmath29 commutes with everything .",
    "this is the usual @xmath2 supersymmetry algebra in @xmath39 space dimensions , and with ( [ susy representation ] ) we have an _ _ representation of this algebra .",
    "thus we will from now on speak of supersymmetry transformations and call the associated charges supercharges .    beside time - translation invariance and the two supersymmetries there",
    "exists still a further invariance , this time for the fermionic functions only . in infinitesimal form",
    "it is given by the transformation @xmath40 where @xmath31 again denotes an infinitesimal even grassmann parameter .",
    "we can think of this as an internal rotation of the fermionic variables .",
    "this invariance leads to a further conserved noether charge : @xmath41 comparison with ( [ lagrangian ] ) shows that the fermionic functions enter the interaction term in the lagrangian only via @xmath42 .",
    "this leads directly to the fact that the @xmath21-motion depends on the fermionic functions only through this one constant .",
    "in addition , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) reveals that the only fermion contribution to the total energy @xmath4 is through @xmath42 .",
    "this is an important simplification , and it will allow us to solve the equations of motion completely for a number of potential functions @xmath24 without restriction on the nature of the grassmann algebra  @xmath1 .",
    "we have already mentioned that the @xmath21-equation of motion ( [ x - equation ] ) nearly decouples from the other two equations because the fermion functions in the coupling term  @xmath43 form a grassmann constant .",
    "it is therefore sensible to begin with this equation .    from the conserved hamiltonian",
    "we know that @xmath44 for the next step we have to use that every grassmann number @xmath45 can be split into two parts , its body and its soul : @xmath46 .",
    "the body is just the real number content of @xmath45 , the soul is the remaining linear combination of products of ( odd ) grassmann generators and will be nilpotent if the grassmann algebra is finitely generated .",
    "note , however , that we do not need such a restriction for body and soul to be well - defined . a square root for a grassmann quantity can be defined by its power series as long as the body is positive . since @xmath42 is the product of two odd grassmann terms , its body and therefore the body of the whole third term on the right hand side of ( [ energy ] ) is zero , leaving the restriction @xmath47 if @xmath48 is to be well - defined .",
    "this just means that the kinetic energy of the classical particle moving in the potential @xmath49 has to be positive .    the resulting first order differential equation for @xmath21 is @xmath50 provided @xmath1 is finitely generated",
    ", we may regard @xmath21 as lying in the vector space @xmath1 and apply the standard theory of systems of ode s to show that this equation has a unique solution for any given initial data @xmath51 .",
    "the equation can formally be solved by separating variables : @xmath52 note that while the left - hand side is just a real expression , the right - hand side is a grassmann integral of a grassmann integrand .",
    "such an integral is defined as a line integral in the grassmann algebra , thought of as a finite or infinite - dimensional vector space spanned by products of generators . as is shown in @xcite such an integral is independent of the actual path relating start- and endpoint of the integral since",
    "the integrand is grassmann - even .",
    "now the integrand comes from an ordinary real function extended into the full grassmann algebra using its power series .",
    "we can therefore sensibly ask whether there is an indefinite integral @xmath53 to this _ real _ function .",
    "if so , we can extend _ this _ function back into the grassmann algebra thus gaining an indefinite integral for the grassmann integrand .",
    "because the integrand is even it then follows @xcite that the integral is given by the difference of @xmath54 evaluated at the start- and endpoints of the path : @xmath55 if the function @xmath54 has an inverse , we finally get @xmath21 as a function of @xmath56 and therefore the solution of ( [ x - equation ] ) .",
    "we will illustrate this method below for two potential functions @xmath24 .",
    "the solution to the fermion equations ( [ fermion - equation 1 ] ) and ( [ fermion - equation 2 ] ) is now easy . from the solution for @xmath57",
    "we can immediately calculate @xmath58 and @xmath59 . using the explicit formulae ( [ q ] ) and ( [ qt ] ) for the two conserved supercharges @xmath60 and @xmath61 we can evaluate the linear combinations @xmath62 where we have used that @xmath63 which follows from ( [ r ] ) . since the hamiltonian @xmath64 has the constant value @xmath4 we deduce that @xmath65 this effectively solves ( [ fermion - equation 1 ] ) and ( [ fermion - equation 2 ] ) , as the values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined by the data at the initial time @xmath9 .",
    "there is one subtle point here , however , since the division by @xmath66 is only possible as long as @xmath67 , the body of @xmath4 , which can be interpreted as the classical energy of the particle , is non - zero . indeed , when we analyse the solution for finitely generated grassmann algebras later , we will find again that the @xmath68-case is special .",
    "a second point which has to be mentioned here is that we have treated @xmath42 as an independent parameter .",
    "however , @xmath42 is _ determined _ by the two fermionic quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 and , in effect , by the two supercharges @xmath60 and @xmath61 : @xmath69 which can be verified using the definition of @xmath42 in ( [ r ] ) .",
    "this does not render our solution invalid but it shows that @xmath42 is not a parameter that can be chosen independently . but let us now turn to some examples :      we start with one of the easiest problems , the harmonic oscillator with potential real . here",
    "the integrand in ( [ grassmann integral ] ) is given by : @xmath70 where @xmath4 is the constant grassmann energy .",
    "note that due to the special nature of the potential we can combine the @xmath71-term @xmath72 with the energy  @xmath4 into one overall constant .",
    "if we treat the integrand as an ordinary real function it has an indefinite integral : @xmath73 so that we can write @xmath74^{x(t)}_{x(t_{0})}.\\ ] ] this formula can be inverted to yield the solution @xmath75 where we have denoted the constant @xmath76 by @xmath77 . this looks formally like the usual harmonic oscillator solution , and it is periodic with period @xmath78 , but all terms are grassmann - valued and not just real functions .    for the two fermion terms we need only calculate @xmath48 and @xmath79 and insert them into equations ( [ fermion1 ] ) and ( [ fermion2 ] ) , which leaves us with : @xmath80 where @xmath81 with ( [ hx - solution ] ) , ( [ hpsi1-solution ] ) and ( [ hpsi2-solution ] ) we have found the complete solution to the equations of motion for @xmath82 , independent of the nature of the grassmann algebra @xmath1 .      as a second example we choose the hyperbolic potential @xmath84 , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 both real .",
    "the integrand in ( [ grassmann integral ] ) is @xmath87 and  viewed as a real function  has an indefinite integral , the form of which depends on the constants involved : @xmath88 because the grassmann - valued function is completely determined by the corresponding real function we have to look at the body of @xmath89 to decide which integral to use .",
    "since @xmath42 as product of two odd grassmann constants has no body , the crucial term is @xmath90 .",
    "all three integrals ( [ integrals ] ) can be inverted to give @xmath21 as a function of @xmath56 : @xmath91 where @xmath92    from equations ( [ fermion1 ] ) and ( [ fermion2 ] ) we can calculate the fermion solutions : @xmath93 with @xmath94 , etc . again , we have found the complete solution for the system without using any information about the grassmann algebra @xmath1 itself .",
    "we will return to this example later , after we have investigated a special class of grassmann algebras .",
    "we will now make a choice for the underlying grassmann algebra @xmath1 of the system , namely that it is generated by a finite number of elements with the property @xmath95 every element @xmath45 of @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath96 with complex coefficients @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath98 is the body of @xmath45 .",
    "the requirement for @xmath45 to be real ( in the sense explained earlier ) fixes each coefficient to be either purely real or purely imaginary , depending on the number of generators involved . for practical reasons we will usually restrict ourselves to the case of four generators ,",
    "although the general aspects of our discussion should be true for an arbitrary number @xmath5 .    in the case of four generators",
    "it is useful to define the following real monomials : @xmath99 note that due to antisymmetry there are only six linearly independent monomials involving two generators , four monomials involving three generators , and just one monomial of highest order , i.e. involving all four generators .",
    "we can decompose the dynamical quantities as follows : @xmath100 where it is implied from here on that the summation over indices is with @xmath101 . in total",
    "there are 24 independent real functions which we call of zeroth , first , second , third or fourth order according to the number of generators involved in the corresponding monomials .",
    "every analytic function involving @xmath21 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 can be decomposed as well using its taylor expansion .",
    "applied to the potential function @xmath24 this yields : @xmath102}\\right)\\xi_{1234},\\ ] ] where the brackets denote antisymmetrization .",
    "for example @xmath103}= x_{12}x_{34}-x_{13}x_{24}+x_{14}x_{23}+x_{23}x_{14}-x_{24}x_{13}+x_{34}x_{12}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath104 and its derivatives are ordinary real functions . inserting these results into ( [ lagrangian ] )",

    "it is remarkable that all equations can be derived from just the one lagrangian .",
    "the other seven component lagrangians are completely redundant and yield no new equations : we can only obtain equation ( [ x0 ] ) whereas from the lagrangians of type ( [ lij ] ) we can derive equations ( [ x0 ] ) , ( [ xij ] ) and ( [ liri ] ) .",
    "now we can also see where the ambiguity mentioned earlier comes from when there is an odd number @xmath5 of generators : because the lagrangian is an even functional , none of its components can contain any function of highest order @xmath5 , so these functions can not be governed by any equations of motion .",
    "e.g. for three generators the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 will stay completely undetermined .",
    "formally , we can derive evolution equations similar to ( [ lijkrijk ] ) by decomposing ( [ fermion - equation 1 ] ) and ( [ fermion - equation 2 ] ) into components but they are meaningless since an arbitrary function can be added to both sides .",
    "thus we can regard these highest order functions as non - physical and treat them as trivially separated gauge degrees of freedom . however , if there is an even number of generators this problem can not occur , since there will always be one lagrangian of highest order containing component functions of all orders which are thus determined by equations of motion .",
    "we now proceed to derive the solutions to the equations of motion ( [ x0])([lijkrijk ] ) for an arbitrary , sufficiently differentiable potential function @xmath24 adopting a layer - by - layer strategy .",
    "that means that we will start with the lowest order or body equation ( [ x0 ] ) and then use its solution to work our way up to the higher order and more complex equations , including also the fermionic ones .",
    "we do this here up to fourth order , although there is no obstruction in principle to continue the strategy for an algebra with more than four generators .",
    "in fact , in every layer the equations and their solutions are the same irrespective of how many generators there are ; there will only be a different number of them .",
    "before we start with the bosonic equations , it is useful to look at the decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath112 and of the noether charge @xmath113 ( note that @xmath42 does not have a body ) : @xmath114}+\\dot{x}_{0}\\dot{x}_{1234}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(uu'\\right)'x_{[12}x_{34]}+uu'x_{1234}\\\\ & & -u'{\\ensuremath{r_{1234}}}- u''x_{[12}r_{34]}\\nonumber\\\\ { \\ensuremath{r_{ij}}}&=&{\\ensuremath{\\lambda_{i}}}\\rho_{j}-{\\ensuremath{\\rho_{i}}}\\lambda_{j}\\label{rij}\\\\ { \\ensuremath{r_{1234}}}&=&\\lambda_{[123}\\rho_{4]}-\\rho_{[123}\\lambda_{4]}.\\label{r1234}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since these are components of grassmann conserved quantities , they are conserved too , as can be checked easily using the equations of motion .",
    "all components can be derived as noether charges from the highest order lagrangian @xmath108 and we will do this in section [ symmetries ] but for now we only need that they are constant in time .",
    "the respective values of the hamiltonian functions @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are denoted in the following by @xmath10 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we notice first that ( [ x0 ] ) is just the standard newtonian equation of motion for a particle moving in a potential @xmath120 .",
    "this is the bottom layer of the system .",
    "the solution to ( [ x0 ] ) using the constancy of the hamiltonian @xmath115 is well - known : @xmath121 the sign has to be chosen carefully to comply with the direction of motion of the particle ; if the particle motion changes direction , the integral will be multi - valued and has to be glued together from pieces with unique sign to ensure that the overall result for @xmath122 is monotonically growing .",
    "the implicit function theorem then allows us to locally invert @xmath122 and obtain the required @xmath107 . since ( [ x0 ] ) is a second order equation there are two constants of integration , @xmath123 ( or equivalently @xmath124 ) and the energy @xmath10 .",
    "whereas ( [ x0 ] ) is a non - linear equation , ( [ xij ] ) is an inhomogeneous _ linear _ equation ( which can be simplified using ( [ rij ] ) ) .",
    "it is now convenient to use the hamiltonian ( [ hij ] ) : solving the equation @xmath125 for @xmath126 we can reduce the problem to a first order differential equation .",
    "this can be solved by standard methods to yield : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an arbitrary integration constant related to the initial value of @xmath129 .",
    "the second integration constant of ( [ xij ] ) is the energy variable @xmath118 .",
    "this result was also found in @xcite with @xmath130 set to @xmath131 .",
    "however , using equation ( [ x0 ] ) and @xmath132 , the last term on the right hand side can be rewritten : @xmath133 so that we end up with the simpler expression @xmath134 all three functions which occur in ( [ solutxij ] ) can be calculated directly from @xmath107 .    the same procedure can be applied to solve ( [ x1234 ] ) which simplifies when we use ( [ rij ] ) .",
    "we rearrange the equation @xmath135 to isolate @xmath136 and then solve this first order equation .",

    "[ active4 ] .",
    "are also symmetries of the lagrangian , but since they are more complicated to write down and we will not use them later we refrain from giving them here .",

    "we finally come to the physical interpretation of the results we have so far obtained concerning the component dynamical variables . starting with the lowest order bosonic function @xmath139 we first recall that this always describes the motion of a particle in one dimension in the potential @xmath207 .",
    "there are three possible types of motion in one dimension :    1 .",
    "movement with no turning point : the particle velocity is always positive ( or negative ) , the motion can be bounded , approaching finite values of @xmath139 as @xmath56 goes to @xmath208 , or unbounded .",
    "example : flat potential function @xmath209 .",
    "2 .   movement with one turning point : the particle velocity changes sign once , when @xmath139 reaches a maximal ( minimal ) value .",
    "again , the motion can be bounded or unbounded .",
    "example : reciprocal potential @xmath210 .",
    "3 .   oscillatory motion : the particle velocity changes sign infinitely often , thus the motion is always restricted to a finite interval .",
    "example : harmonic oscillator @xmath6 .",
    "there is one conserved quantity , namely the lowest order hamiltonian @xmath115 , given in ( [ h0 ] ) .",
    "we can interpret this as half the squared length of the two - dimensional bosonic vector @xmath211 the conservation of @xmath115 means that the motion of this vector is restricted to a circle with squared radius @xmath212 .",
    "corresponding to the three types of motion for @xmath139 there are three types of motion for this vector :    1 .",
    "movement with no turning point : the vector moves on the right ( left ) semicircle in the @xmath144-@xmath24-plane .",
    "the number of direction changes depends on the number of potential extrema of @xmath24 .",
    "2 .   movement with one turning point : motion starts on the right ( left ) semicircle of the @xmath144-@xmath24-plane , then changes when the turning point is reached to the other semicircle where it then mirrors the previous motion .",
    "3 .   oscillatory motion : there are two subcases , depending on whether the number of sign changes of @xmath79 between the two extremal points @xmath213 and @xmath214 is odd or even . 1 .   when there is an odd number the vector will continually wind around the circle ; direction changes depending on the number of extrema of @xmath24 can be superimposed .",
    "this is the only case where the motion covers the complete circle .",
    "the most important example is the harmonic oscillator where we can see directly the circular motion of the bosonic vector .",
    "when the number of sign changes of @xmath24 is even , the bosonic vector will oscillate on the circle between two points lying symmetrically on either side of the @xmath24-axis .",
    "an example of this case is the potential function @xmath215 with @xmath216 , which leads to a harmonic oscillator potential shifted upwards by @xmath85 .",
    "the bosonic vector is important because it largely determines the behaviour of the @xmath5 first order fermionic functions . to see this , we look at the @xmath5 two - dimensional vectors @xmath217 the charges @xmath218 introduced in ( [ lincharge1 ] ) guarantee that the lengths of these vectors are conserved , thus their motions are also restricted to circles .",
    "the squared radii are given by @xmath219 , providing us with a nice geometrical interpretation of these constants .",
    "furthermore , the charges @xmath220 , given by ( [ lincharge2 ] ) , can be interpreted as _ scalar products _ between the @xmath18th and @xmath221th vectors , thus effectively specifying the absolute value of the angle between them .",
    "hence we can see already that all @xmath5 vectors must corotate .",
    "this can be confirmed further by the charges @xmath130 calculated in ( [ rij ] ) .",
    "they can be seen as two - dimensional _ determinants _ , fixing the area of the parallelogram defined by the above - mentioned two vectors .",
    "it then follows that the sign of the angle between these is determined , too .",
    "the other conserved quantities that involve only terms of first or lower order are the supercharges @xmath145 and @xmath146 , given in ( [ qiqti ] ) .",
    "they couple the fermionic vectors with the bosonic vector : the charges @xmath145 fix the scalar products , the constants @xmath146 the determinants between @xmath222 and @xmath223 , so that all angles between these vectors , including their signs , are determined and constant in time .",
    "this means that once the bosonic motion is calculated and the fermionic initial data is given , we can read off the time evolution of all fermionic functions since their vectors are rigidly corotating with the bosonic one .    having now dealt with the lowest order bosonic and fermionic functions we have to ask how to interpret the higher order functions . unfortunately , the geometric interpretation of these can not be seen as clearly . instead we will interpret the higher order functions as _ variations _ of those of lower order .    to start with , @xmath129",
    "as given in ( [ solutxij ] ) has two terms coming from the two homogeneous solutions of the @xmath129-equation with coefficients @xmath128 and @xmath118 and the term with coefficient @xmath224 which constitutes a particular solution .",
    "we will now show that the first two terms can be written as variations of the lowest order motion @xmath139 with respect to the two free parameters @xmath124 and @xmath10 of that motion .",
    "the variation of @xmath107 with @xmath124 is clearly proportional to the @xmath225 which gives us the term with coefficient @xmath128 .",
    "next we vary the equation @xmath132 : @xmath226 using equation ( [ x0 ] ) , dividing by @xmath227 and integrating between @xmath124 and @xmath56 we obtain @xmath228 hence @xmath229_{{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}}}^t=\\delta e_{0}\\int_{{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}}}^t \\frac{1}{\\dot{x}_{0}^{2}}dt'\\ ] ] and finally @xmath230 which is exactly the term with coefficient @xmath118 in ( [ solutxij ] ) .",
    "so we end up with : @xmath231    in the same way we can analyse the third order fermion solutions ( [ 3rdvar1 ] ) and ( [ 3rdvar2 ] ) . both have parts proportional to @xmath144 and @xmath24 .",
    "but in addition there are two further terms which have to be interpreted as variations of these parts with @xmath124 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath124-variations can be written down immediately : @xmath232 and yield the terms with coefficients @xmath233}$ ] and @xmath234}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath10-variations give : @xmath235 they explain the first part of the terms with coefficients @xmath236}$ ] and @xmath237}$ ] ; note that the second part can be absorbed into the @xmath152 and @xmath153-terms .",
    "so the vectors formed by @xmath158 and @xmath159 consist of three parts : a vector rigidly fixed to the familiar first order fermionic vectors and two parts which are proportional to the variation of these vectors with @xmath124 and @xmath10 .",
    "finally we want to explain the parts of the highest order bosonic function @xmath175 .",
    "the first three terms of ( [ 4var ] ) are familiar : they are the variations of @xmath139 with @xmath124 and @xmath10 and the inhomogeneity term proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "the next three terms can be explained as _ second _ variations .",
    "so @xmath171 gives the second variation of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath124 ; for the term with coefficient @xmath238}$ ] we have already shown that it is the time derivative of @xmath239 , hence it is proportional to @xmath240 .",
    "so we only have to deal with the @xmath177}$]-component .",
    "we find that @xmath241 the last term can be rewritten as @xmath242 combining this with the expanded first term @xmath243 we find exactly the component in ( [ 4var ] ) with coefficient @xmath177}$ ] .",
    "the last two terms in ( [ 4var ] ) are easy again : they are given by the two first variations of the inhomogeneity term @xmath244 with @xmath124 and @xmath10 , which we have already calculated above .",
    "note that the term @xmath245 with coefficient @xmath246}$ ] can be absorbed into the @xmath192 term .    in summary",
    "the lowest order bosonic function @xmath139 describes the one - dimensional motion of a point particle with energy @xmath10 in the potential @xmath247 .",
    "it is completely unaffected by all higher order bosonic and all fermionic functions and not influenced by any higher order charges .",
    "there are two free parameters involved , an initial time @xmath124 and the energy @xmath10 .",
    "the first order fermionic functions comprise two - dimensional vectors @xmath222 .",
    "the lengths of these vectors and the angles between them are fixed by charges arising from symmetry under change of basis in the grassmann algebra and from the second order charge @xmath130 , and so are constant in time , i.e. all fermionic vectors rigidly corotate .",
    "their motion is in turn determined by the bosonic vector @xmath223 which has constant squared length @xmath212 and is rigidly coupled to the fermion vectors by the supercharges @xmath145 and @xmath146 . for every generator there is a pair of free parameters which specify the length and the phase of the corresponding vector .",
    "the second order bosonic function @xmath129 has terms proportional to the ( first ) variation of @xmath139 with @xmath124 and @xmath10 .",
    "there is one additional term proportional to @xmath24 stemming from the inhomogeneity of the @xmath129-equation of motion and ultimately from the yukawa interaction term .",
    "the third order fermionic functions again comprise two - dimensional vectors @xmath248 .",
    "they can be divided into three additive parts .",
    "the first part is rigidly rotating with the first order fermionic vectors , the second and third parts are proportional to the variations of this first order vectorial motion with initial time @xmath124 and @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the fourth order bosonic function involves all first and second order variations of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath124 and @xmath10 plus a further term proportional to @xmath24 and _ its _ first order variations .",
    "in this section we apply our results of the previous section to oscillatory motion , i.e. we assume that the lowest order bosonic function @xmath139 is periodic with period @xmath249 .",
    "we have found already that in this case the first order fermionic motion is described by two - dimensional vectors that either continuously wind around a circle or oscillate between two symmetrically lying points on it , depending on the number of sign changes of @xmath24 .",
    "when we look at the next bosonic level , i.e. the functions @xmath250 , we can see immediately that the first part of the solution ( [ solutxij ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath144 , is a periodic function with the same period @xmath249 .",
    "the last term proportional to @xmath251 is periodic , too , but it can have period @xmath252 if the potential function @xmath104 has reflection symmetry , i.e. if @xmath253 for some constant @xmath254 .",
    "let therefore @xmath255 , which is either @xmath249 or @xmath252 , denote the period of @xmath256 .",
    "the most interesting term is the remaining second one containing the integral .",
    "we will analyse this term from a mathematical point of view using floquet theory but before we do that we would like to understand it from a more physical perspective .    from equation ( [ xijvar ] ) in the previous section we know that the integral term can be interpreted as the variation of the solution @xmath139 with respect to the energy @xmath10 . because the variation is infinitesimally small",
    ", we can make the assumption that the functional form of the motion remains unchanged .",
    "we treat the motion as determined by only two parameters , the period @xmath249 and a characteristic amplitude @xmath257 , defined e.g. as the distance between the two turning points of the motion . in the generic case @xmath249 and @xmath257",
    "will be related by a non - trivial function @xmath258 , therefore a change in energy means not only a change in the amplitude @xmath257 but also in the period @xmath249 , so : @xmath259 since @xmath139 is a @xmath249-periodic function we can use its fourier series @xmath260 , where @xmath261 and the coefficients @xmath262 are regarded as functions of @xmath257 , to find : @xmath263 thus @xmath264 both @xmath265 and @xmath144 are @xmath249-periodic functions , but @xmath266 itself is clearly not since the second term is _",
    "linear_-periodic , i.e. the product of the linear term @xmath56 with a periodic function .",
    "the extra linear - periodic term diverges with time , thus seemingly spoiling the oscillatory nature of the solution .",
    "however , this problem only arises because the period of the oscillation depends on the amplitude @xmath257 and thus ultimately on the energy @xmath10 . expressing a solution with slightly changed period @xmath267 in terms of @xmath249-periodic functions inevitably leads to non - periodic terms .",
    "the effect is well - known from celestial mechanics where linear - periodic functions appear as secular terms in the study of stability problems of planetary orbits ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there is one case where no linear - periodic term occurs , and this is when @xmath268 i.e. when the period is independent of the amplitude .",
    "this is true for the harmonic oscillator , and consequently there is no non - periodic term in equation ( [ harmxijsolut ] ) .    the existence of non - periodic terms in the bosonic function @xmath250 can be derived in a mathematically more stringent way from floquet theory , the theory of linear differential equations with periodic coefficients . equation ( [ xij ] ) , with @xmath269 replaced by the constant @xmath130 according to ( [ rij ] ) , determines the motion of @xmath250 . because we know that the particular solution proportional to @xmath24 is periodic it suffices to treat the homogeneous equation which can be written in the form @xmath270 where @xmath271 is a @xmath255-periodic function .",
    "this allows us to apply floquet theory which states that @xcite :    1 .",

    "there exist linearly independent solutions @xmath275 and @xmath276 to ( [ floquet ] ) , such that either @xmath277 or @xmath278 where in both cases @xmath279 are @xmath255-periodic functions and @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , called characteristic exponents , are  not necessarily distinct  constants .",
    "whether the solutions take the form ( [ floquet1 ] ) or ( [ floquet2 ] ) depends on whether there are two independent solutions of ( [ floquet ] ) with the property ( [ multiplier ] ) or just one .",
    "if we denote by @xmath283 the two linearly independent solutions of ( [ floquet ] ) with @xmath284 and by @xmath285 the matrix @xmath286 we get a solution of type ( [ floquet1 ] ) if @xmath287 is diagonalizable and a solution of type ( [ floquet2 ] ) if @xmath287 has jordan normal form .    to determine the characteristic exponents @xmath288 it is useful to notice that our equation is not an arbitrary differential equation with periodic coefficients but an example of hill s equation which takes the form @xmath289 @xmath54 and @xmath290 being @xmath255-periodic functions . for equations of hill s type the floquet multipliers",

    "this trace can be determined indirectly , using the fact that we know one periodic solution namely @xmath144 , which has either period @xmath255 or @xmath292 , depending on whether @xmath293 is reflection - symmetric or not .",
    "now we can use another theorem of floquet theory which states :    1 .",
    "hill s equation has non - trivial solutions with period @xmath255 if and only if @xmath294 . then",
    "either @xmath295 and @xmath296 or @xmath297 and @xmath298 2 .",

    "either @xmath300 and @xmath301 or @xmath302 and @xmath303    using these theorems we find that the second independent solution ( [ xijvar ] ) has to be either periodic or linear - periodic .",
    "the period is in both cases @xmath249 , the period of the first independent solution @xmath144 .",
    "this means that we can formally confirm our earlier result derived from physical arguments .",
    "additionally , we have that any solution must be bounded in finite intervals .",
    "this is not immediately obvious from the explicit form of ( [ xijvar ] ) , which could be singular when @xmath304 .",
    "before we proceed to analyse a particular potential function which admits oscillatory motion we want to comment briefly on the higher order bosonic and fermionic quantities @xmath305 and @xmath175",
    ". from equations ( [ 3rdvar1 ] ) and ( [ 3rdvar2 ] ) we can see that all terms that appear in the third order fermionic solution are either periodic or linear - periodic . for the term",
    "@xmath306 this follows e.g. from the fact that the derivative of a linear - periodic term is again linear - periodic .",
    "we can expect this behaviour physically since @xmath307 and @xmath308 are given by the _ first _",
    "variation of the motion of the first order fermionic vectors with energy and initial time .",
    "( there are further periodic contributions to @xmath307 and @xmath308 with coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath153 . )",
    "most terms in the fourth order bosonic solution @xmath175 can be easily seen to be periodic or linear - periodic in the same manner . however , there are the three terms which have been interpreted as the _ second _ variation of @xmath139 with energy @xmath10 .",
    "these should contain a quadratic term in @xmath56 , because @xmath309 \\left(\\frac{da}{de_{0}}\\right)^{2}+\\left[\\frac{\\partial { \\ensuremath{x_{0}}}}{\\partial a } + \\frac{\\partial { \\ensuremath{x_{0}}}}{\\partial t}\\frac{dt}{da}\\right ] \\frac{d^{2}a}{de_{0}^{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath310 all other terms being ( linear-)periodic .",
    "again , the quadratic term does not occur when period @xmath249 and amplitude @xmath257 are independent , i.e. when @xmath311 .",
    "this is confirmed by the harmonic oscillator example where @xmath175 is completely periodic .",
    "we can also understand the existence of a quadratic - periodic term directly from the which contains the term @xmath312 we know already that the integral will yield a term proportional to @xmath56 ; this is squared to give a quadratic term in @xmath56 , and then multiplied by the periodic function @xmath171 .",
    "this quadratic term can not cancel out because the two remaining terms with coefficient @xmath177}$ ] in ( [ 4var ] ) are at most linear - periodic .",
    "we illustrate our results by the hyperbolic potential @xmath84 , already discussed in section [ grassmannhyperbol ] for general grassmann algebra .",
    "since we are only interested in oscillatory motion here , we make the assumption that @xmath313 .",
    "inverting the result obtained from ( [ solutxn ] ) we can calculate that    @xmath314    with @xmath315 so @xmath139 is indeed a periodic function .    for @xmath144 and @xmath24 we immediately find that @xmath316 where we have abbreviated @xmath317 to @xmath318 .",
    "therefore the motion of the bosonic is a _ non - uniform rotation _ , which confirms our comments in section [ interpret ] since the potential function @xmath24 changes sign only once .",
    "all fermionic vectors corotate with the bosonic one .    to determine @xmath250 we need the integral @xmath319 we then obtain for the @xmath118-related part of @xmath250 : @xmath320 this result clearly shows a linear periodic term which means that the period - amplitude relation is non - trivial . in fact , period and amplitude of @xmath321 , the latter defined as distance between the two turning points , can be easily calculated using ( [ xnhyperbol ] ) : @xmath322 thus @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "we point out that all terms in the solution are clearly bounded , which is not the case for the integral itself .",
    "figure [ diagram2 ] gives an example of both the bosonic quantities @xmath325 and @xmath250 and the fermionic quantities @xmath326 and @xmath327 .    we do not present the higher order solutions in detail here since their explicit form ,",
    "although not complicated to find , is lengthy and does not provide new insights .",
    "the only interesting exception is the part of @xmath175 which has been characterized as a second variation with energy .",
    "this part can be calculated to be @xmath328}\\left [ \\frac{(\\alpha^{3}\\!-\\!3\\alpha^{2}\\!+\\!6\\alpha)\\sin y\\sec^{3}y + ( 2\\alpha^{2}\\!-\\!4\\alpha)\\sin y \\sec y } { k(c^{2}\\!-\\!2e_{0})^{2}\\sqrt{(\\alpha \\sec^{2}y\\!-\\!1)^{3}}}\\right.\\\\ & & \\left.+(t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})\\left(\\frac{\\left(-2\\alpha^{2 } + \\alpha\\right)\\sec^{2}y+1}{\\sqrt{(c^{2}\\!-\\!2e_{0})^{3 } } \\sqrt{(\\alpha\\sec^{2}y\\!-\\!1)^{3}}}\\right ) + ( t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})^{2}\\left(-\\frac{k\\alpha}{c^{2}\\!-\\!2e_{0 } } \\frac{\\sin y \\sec^{3}y}{\\sqrt{(\\alpha \\sec^{2}y\\!-\\!1)^{3 } } } \\right ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have abbreviated @xmath329 to @xmath272 .",
    "again , there are two noteworthy points here : firstly , the occurence of a quadratic - periodic term , which has been predicted in section [ interpret ] and secondly the complete boundedness of the whole solution , which is not immediately obvious from the functional form ( [ 4var ] ) , especially regarding the term where the velocity appears in the denominator .",
    "next we want to show that the two solution methods presented in this paper deliver the same result .",
    "therefore we have to decompose our previous solution , the first of equations ( [ xnhyperbolgrassmann ] ) , from section [ grassmannhyperbol ] . recall that any real analytical function @xmath330 is extended to a grassmann - valued function by the formula @xmath331 where @xmath332 and @xmath333 are body and soul of the grassmann number @xmath45 , respectively @xcite .",
    "to keep the calculation short we will expand here only up to second order , i.e. the following equations have to be understood modulo a component proportional to @xmath200 .",
    "we begin with the frequency @xmath334 : @xmath335 then @xmath336 since @xmath337 we find @xmath338\\xi_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath339 .",
    "this result equals @xmath340 ; decomposition yields : @xmath341 thus by comparison @xmath342 which gives the same solution for @xmath139 as ( [ xnhyperbol ] ) .",
    "similarly , we can read off the result for @xmath343 and then calculate @xmath250 : @xmath344 the term with coefficient @xmath130 can be readily identified as the potential function @xmath345 , derived in ( [ hyperbolu ] ) .",
    "the second term with coefficient @xmath346 equals the velocity @xmath144 , which we have calculated in ( [ hyperbolxdot ] ) , when we make the identification .",
    "finally , the term proportional to @xmath118 is identical with our .",
    "so the solution found by using our layer - by - layer approach can also be obtained by the decomposition of the full grassmann solution calculated through direct integration in grassmann space .",
    "we have demonstrated this feature here using the bosonic quantity @xmath57 but we could equally well have chosen one of the fermionic quantities @xmath347 or @xmath348 .",
    "this means that our two solution methods are compatible with each other .",
    "we have already mentioned in sections [ solfixpot ] and [ solarbpot ] that the case where the energy @xmath10 , the body of the full grassmann energy @xmath4 , equals zero has to be treated differently .",
    "all the solutions to the equations of motion ( [ x0])([lijkrijk ] ) were given under the restriction @xmath349 so that we can not use our previous results .",
    "it will turn out , however , that for a finitely generated grassmann algebra we can derive all solutions in explicit functional form for arbitrary potential .    starting with equation ( [ h0 ] )",
    "we can see that if @xmath350 both @xmath144 and @xmath104 have to vanish : @xmath351 this means that the particle stays permanently at rest at a minimum @xmath352 of the one could assume at this point that all higher order bosonic and fermionic functions are trivial as well , but as we shall soon see this is far from being necessary , in contradiction to @xcite .    because @xmath107 is constant , all the ( spatial ) derivatives of @xmath24 are constant functions of time too ; we denote their values by @xmath353 we assume in the following that @xmath354 .",
    "when we now look at the first order fermionic equations ( [ liri ] ) for @xmath326 and @xmath327 , we find that they are easily solved by the harmonic oscillator ansatz : @xmath355 unlike the true harmonic oscillator , the constants @xmath156 and @xmath157 are , however , not linked to the first order supercharges @xmath145 and @xmath146 which vanish completely as can be verified from ( [ qiqti ] ) .    to understand the first order fermionic motion we assume that the energy @xmath10 is small but non - zero , restricting the particle motion to a small neighbourhood of the stability point @xmath352 where the potential function @xmath24 is approximately linear .",
    "the result is an almost harmonic oscillation with frequency @xmath356 , mirrored by the fermionic quantities  as follows from ( [ fermionharm1 ] ) and ( [ fermionharm2 ] ) .",
    "when we now let @xmath10 approach zero , this fermionic motion seems to diverge as one can see from the formulae for the coefficients @xmath166 and @xmath167 in ( [ li ] ) and ( [ ri ] ) .",
    "however , there is a subtle point here : while the supercharges @xmath145 and @xmath146 are arbitrarily chosen constants for @xmath357 , they have to vanish for @xmath350 .",
    "thus to avoid any discontinuities they have to smoothly approach zero as the energy decreases .",
    "exactly how they approach zero finally determines which value the harmonic oscillator coefficients @xmath166 and @xmath167 take in the limit @xmath350 , which justifies the two remaining degrees of freedom in our solution , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "next we want to analyse the second order bosonic quantity @xmath250 . because @xmath23 and @xmath106 are constants the equation of motion ( [ xij ] ) describes formally a harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath356 subject to a constant external force @xmath358 , so the solution ( for @xmath359 ) is @xmath360 where @xmath361 and @xmath362 are integration constants . to interpret this result",
    "we recall that in case @xmath357 the homogeneous part of @xmath250 consists of two terms , the two variational derivatives of @xmath139 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath124 .",
    "when @xmath10 is zero , a small change in energy will result in oscillatory motion around the stability point @xmath352 .",
    "this explains the functional form and one of the free parameters of the solution ( [ e0xij ] ) .",
    "the second parameter , though , can not be connected to the variation with @xmath124 anymore since this variation is zero for a constant @xmath139 .",
    "an interesting observation is connected to the second order energy which can be calculated from ( [ hij ] ) to be @xmath363 .",
    "thus the second order energy is not independent any more but determined by the four first order constants @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath364 , @xmath365 .",
    "note the fact that @xmath118 is _ not _ connected to the parameters @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "the third order fermion equations ( [ lijkrijk ] ) are again equations describing a harmonic oscillator with a driving term .",
    "the homogeneous part of the solution looks therefore the same as ( [ e0li ] ) and ( [ e0ri ] ) with integration constants @xmath152 and @xmath153 . to find the particular solution we have to investigate the driving terms @xmath366}$ ] and @xmath367}$ ] further . using equations ( [ e0li ] ) , ( [ e0ri ] ) and ( [ e0xij ] )",
    "we find @xmath368}&=&c_{ijk}+d_{1,ijk}\\sin 2k_{1}(t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0 } } } )   - d_{2,ijk } \\cos 2k_{1 } ( t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})\\\\ x_{[ij}\\lambda_{k]}&=&\\tilde{c}_{ijk}+d_{2,ijk } \\sin 2k_{1}(t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0 } } } ) + d_{1,ijk } \\cos 2k_{1}(t-{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath369 , @xmath370 , @xmath371 and @xmath372 are constants built from @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath361 and @xmath362 .",
    "so the driving terms are not constant but have an oscillating part that oscillates with _",
    "double _ the basic frequency @xmath356 .",
    "the particular solutions are thus @xmath373 the fermionic vectors @xmath248 consist of three parts : a uniform rotation with natural frequency @xmath356 , a forced uniform rotation with double this frequency that we can interpret as the _ first excited _ mode and a constant shift away from the origin .",
    "note that there is no double frequency term if @xmath374 , and in particular for the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "this agrees with our earlier result in section [ harmpot ] .    calculating the supercharges @xmath154 and @xmath155 from ( [ qiqti ] )",
    "we find that @xmath375 and @xmath376 which gives us a neat interpretation of the displacement constants @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "it further means that the third order supercharges are not related to the free parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 as is the case for @xmath377 but instead are completely determined by first and second order parameters .",
    "this is the same phenomenon already encountered for the second order energy @xmath118 and again it means that we should not think of @xmath154 and @xmath155 as independent constants when @xmath350 .",
    "finally we have to investigate the fourth order bosonic quantity @xmath175 .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ x1234 ] ) simplifies in the case @xmath350 to @xmath378}+ k_{2}r_{1234}+k_{3}x_{[12}r_{34]},\\ ] ] so it describes a harmonic oscillator with three driving terms .",
    "the homogeneous part is analogous to ( [ e0xij ] ) with two integration constants @xmath138 and @xmath379 ; the comments made about @xmath250 apply here , too . analyzing the three driving terms",
    "we first note that @xmath380 specifies a constant external force , playing the same role as @xmath358 for the variables @xmath250 .",
    "the first and third terms can be calculated using the explicit formulae for @xmath250 , resulting in @xmath381}+k_{3}x_{[12}r_{34 ] } & = & -\\frac{3}{4}k_{1}k_{2}\\left(c_{1234}+d_{1234 } \\cos2k_{1}(t\\!-\\!{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})+\\tilde{d}_{1234}\\sin 2k_{1}(t\\!-\\!{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})\\right)\\\\    & & + \\left(k_{3}\\!-\\!3\\frac{k_{2}^{2}}{k_{1}}\\right)\\left(f_{1234 }   \\cos k_{1}(t\\!-\\!{\\ensuremath{t_{0 } } } ) + \\tilde{f}_{1234 } \\sin k_{1}(t\\!-\\!{\\ensuremath{t_{0}}})\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath382 , @xmath383 , @xmath384 , @xmath385 and @xmath386 are fixed constants built from @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath130 .",
    "so besides a further constant term we find four oscillating ones , two with frequency @xmath356 and two with frequency @xmath387 .",
    "the latter ones will cause forced harmonic motion with double the natural frequency as we found for the third order fermionic terms .",
    "new , however , are the oscillating terms which have the _ same _ frequency as the homogenous solution .",
    "this means that the oscillator is driven in resonance .",
    "therefore the solution is not bounded anymore but includes linear - periodic terms like @xmath388 and @xmath389 . combining all contributions we find the particular solution @xmath390 thus the fourth order bosonic solution consists of harmonic oscillation with the natural frequency @xmath356 , an excited mode with twice this frequency , linear - periodic motion and a constant shift .",
    "especially interesting are the linear - periodic terms .",
    "they can be explained physically as in section [ specialtypesofmotion ] , although we have to see them as the _ second _ variation with energy here : when the particle stays at rest in a potential minimum the first variation gives rise to harmonic oscillation , independently of the shape of the potential function @xmath24 ( as long as @xmath354 ) .",
    "only when we look at the second order variation do non - harmonic terms come into play : the period of oscillation will in general depend on the amplitude and the energy , therefore a variation in energy results in a change of period ; expressing the new solution in terms of the old period then generally leads to secular , non - periodic terms .    notice the fascinating fact that although the physical interpretation is similar , the way the linear - periodic terms arise mathematically is completely different : for non - zero energy oscillations they come as solutions of a _ homogenous _ differential equation with _ periodic _ coefficients ; in the zero energy case they are particular solutions to an _ inhomogenous _ differential equation with _ constant _ coefficients .",
    "in this work we have analysed a supersymmetric mechanical model from two different viewpoints : either we make no specification with regard to the nature of the underlying grassmann algebra @xmath1 .",
    "then for a range of potential functions @xmath24 the model can be explicitly solved . or we regard @xmath1 as finitely generated thus reducing all quantities to a set of real functions and their interrelationships",
    ". then we are able to solve the system completely , without any restrictions on @xmath24 .",
    "the methods have been shown to be compatible with each other here .",
    "an open question with our first point of view is what meaning we can give to the full , i.e. non - decomposed grassmann solutions @xmath391 and @xmath348 .",
    "interpretation may be aided by our second approach , where we have shown that the component solutions include the purely classical motion dependent on @xmath10 _ and _ all its variations with respect to this ( real ) constant .",
    "apparently , supersymmetric dynamics captures information about a whole range of energies of the mechanical system , so in a sense we can say that the grassmann energy @xmath4 corresponds to some fuzzy classical energy .",
    "this suggests possibly that supersymmetric classical dynamics is closely related to the quantum dynamics .",
    "a study of the quantized version of our model would therefore be an important step to complement this research .",
    "we also hope to apply our methods to the full , i.e. space- and time - dependent field theory .",
