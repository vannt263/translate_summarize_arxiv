    ". @xcite . in the following discussion",
    ", the position of one side can be expressed by reformulation of the rhetorical question by hubbard @xcite : `` how , in the itinerant model , explain a curie temperature @xmath113 for iron , when calculations always give an exchange field @xmath114 ev ? '' in the form : how , in the de model , explain a curie temperature @xmath115 for a manganite ( at optimal doping ) , when calculations always give a bandwidth @xmath114 ev ?",
    "the fallacy is based on the implicit assumption that the @xmath3 should be of the order of the energy difference between the fully ordered fm state and the paramagnetic state ( which is the smallest of the band width and the exchange integral ) .",
    "it does not take into account that the fluctuations which restore magnetic symmetry in itinerant models are local fluctuations in the orientation of magnetic moments , with much lower energy @xcite .",
