    "<S> indeed , in the optical spectra of single dots spectrally narrow emission peaks have been observed ( indicating a small environment coupling ) , which undergo discrete energy shifts when more carriers are added to the dot ( indicating energy renormalizations due to additional coulomb interactions ) @xcite .    in this paper we discuss how these spectral changes result from few - particle interactions . </S>",

    "<S> next , the few - particle hamiltonian ( containing all possible @xmath2-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath3 , and @xmath3-@xmath3 coulomb matrix elements ) is expanded within the basis of the @xmath41020 energetically - lowest single - particle states , and the few - particle states are obtained by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix ( see appendix ) . for simplicity , in the calculation of the few - particle @xmath2-@xmath3 states interaction processes with the dot environment </S>",

    "<S> figure 1_(a ) _ shows the linear optical absorption for a prototypical dot confinement which is parabolic in the @xmath14-plane and box - like along @xmath15 @xcite ; such confinement potentials have been demonstrated to be a particularly good approximation for various kinds of self - assembled dots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a series of pronounced absorption peaks ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ,  ) with an energy splitting of the order of the confinement energy ; an inspection of the exciton wavefunctions @xmath6 reveals that the dominant contribution of excitons @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is from the electron and hole single - particle states @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( see inset of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> because of coulomb interactions the energy separation between the groundstate exciton @xmath16 and @xmath17 is increased , and oscillator strength is transferred from peaks of higher energy to those of lower energy ( note that in a pure single - particle picture the ratio of peak heights follows the degeneracy of the respective shells , i.e. , @xmath22 ) ; finally , for a discussion of the additional coulomb - induced peaks ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ,  ) the reader is referred to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we only discuss the case of two electrons ( holes ) with antiparallel spin orientations ( for parallel spins see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , the biexciton energies @xmath27 and wavefunctions @xmath28 are obtained from the @xmath29-@xmath30 schrdinger equation ( accounting for the various @xmath2-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath3 , and @xmath3-@xmath3 coulomb interactions ) which , for conceptual clarity , we write in the exciton basis @xmath31 @xcite :    @xmath32    with @xmath33 the exciton - exciton coulomb elements @xcite , and @xmath31 , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) labeling exciton states with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the exciton - exciton interaction @xmath37 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : biexcitons ] ) is responsible for the renormalization of the biexciton spectrum . roughly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> the leading contributions to @xmath37 are of dipole - dipole character , with the dipole elements @xmath38 according to the excitonic transitions from @xmath31 to @xmath35 ( @xmath34 to @xmath39 ) @xcite ; thus , in general both optically allowed and forbidden ( due to wavefunction symmetry ; see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1_(b ) _ ) excitons with their small and large values of @xmath40 , respectively , contribute to @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2_(b ) _ ( 2_(c ) _ ) shows optical absorption for a dot which is initially prepared in the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) single - exciton state ; this scenario of optically probing a non - equilibrium dot is similar to the nonlinear coherent optical response , where a strong pump pulse creates an exciton population at energy @xmath41 and a weak probe pulse monitors the spectral changes due to the induced exciton population @xcite . for the dot initially prepared in state @xmath16 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2_(b ) _ ) , we observe : at energy @xmath42 negative absorption ( i.e. , gain ) due to the removal of the initial exciton population ( i.e. , stimulated emission via @xmath43 ) ; the appearance of an absorption peak @xmath44 on the low - energy side of @xmath16 and of a peak multiplet ( labeled @xmath45 ) at spectral position @xmath17 , attributed to the photo - induced formation of biexcitonic states via @xmath46 . to a good approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the biexciton groundstate @xmath44 consists of two groundstate excitons @xmath16 with antiparallel spin orientations ( because of the small value of @xmath40 for optically allowed excitons the biexciton binding is relatively small ) ; the biexciton states @xmath45 consist of @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs in the @xmath19 and @xmath20-shells ( see inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1_(a ) _ ) , where the strong mixing with optically forbidden excitons ( large @xmath40 s ) leads to large renormalizations and to a strong decrease of the oscillator strengths of the absorption peaks .    </S>",
    "<S> _ multi - excitons . _ </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn to the case of a dot populated by a larger number of electron - hole pairs . in a typical single - dot experiment @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , a pump pulse creates @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs in continuum states ( e.g. , wetting layer ) in the vicinity of the qd , and some of the carriers become captured in the qd ; from experiment it is known that there is a fast subsequent carrier relaxation due to environment coupling to the @xmath2-@xmath3 states of lowest energy @xcite ; finally , electrons and holes in the dot recombine by emitting a photon . by varying in a steady - state experiment the pump intensity and by monitoring luminescence from the dot states , one thus obtains information about the few - particle carrier states . from a theoretical point of view , luminescence involves a process where one @xmath2-@xmath3 pair is removed from the interacting many - particle system and one photon is created . </S>",
    "<S> thus , luminescence spectra provide information about @xmath2-@xmath3 excitations , in contrast to transport measurements of qds @xcite which only provide information about the few - particle groundstate .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3_(a ) _ shows luminescence spectra for different numbers of @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs ( with dot parameters of @xcite ; luminescence intensity computed according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and using the few - particle states of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : few - particle ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that before photon emission the interacting @xmath2-@xmath3 system is in its respective groundstate , i.e. , for one @xmath2-@xmath3 pair the exciton groundstate @xmath16 ; for two @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs the state @xmath44 ; for three @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs approximately a filled @xmath19-shell and one @xmath2-@xmath3 pair in the @xmath20-shell , etc . ; </S>",
    "<S> thus , for one @xmath2-@xmath3 pair luminescence solely originates from the decay of @xmath16 ; for two @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs the biexciton @xmath44 decays into @xmath16 , where the emission peak is slightly red - shifted because of the biexciton binding . in case of three @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs the situation is more involved : for recombination of an @xmath2-@xmath3 pair in the @xmath20-shell , the corresponding luminescence peak is red - shifted by @xmath4710 mev with respect to @xmath17 because of exchange corrections of the groundstate energy ; for recombination in the @xmath19 shell , after photon emission the dot is in an excited biexciton state ; consequently , the peak multiplet in the luminescence spectra is determined by the rather complicated density of states of biexcitonic resonances ( see discussion above ) . finally , </S>",
    "<S> for an increasing number of @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs we observe emission from the @xmath19 and @xmath20 shells , where the peak multiplet from the @xmath19-shell emission exhibits strong spectral changes as a function of the number of @xmath2-@xmath3 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our findings are similar to those obtained in the strong - confinement limit @xcite ( the difference for the @xmath48-@xmath49 decay is due to the coupling to higher shells , which are considered in our calculations ) . elsewhere </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it will be shown that our calculated luminescence spectra are in good agreement with experimental single - dot data , with the dots of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ multi - charged excitons . </S>",
    "<S> _ we finally discuss luminescence spectra of multiple - charged excitons . </S>",
    "<S> experimental realization of such carrier complexes can be found , e.g. , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where gaas / algaas quantum dots are remote - doped with electrons from donors located in the vicinity of the dot . employing the mechanism of photo - depletion of the qd together with the slow hopping transport of impurity - bound electrons back to the qd , it is possible to efficiently control the number of surplus electrons in the qd from one to approximately six @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3_(b ) _ shows luminescence spectra of charged excitons for a varying number of surplus electrons and for the prototypical dot confinement of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quite generally , the spectral changes with increasing doping are similar to those presented for multi - exciton states : with increasing doping the main peaks red - shift because of exchange and correlation effects . as in the case of multi - exciton states </S>",
    "<S> , each few - particle state leads to a specific fingerprint in the optical response . </S>",
    "<S> this unique assignment of peaks or peak multiplets to given few - particle configurations allows to unambiguously determine the detailed few - particle configuration of carriers in qds in optical experiments ; this fact is used in ref .  </S>",
