    "<S> the problem of thermalizing a quantum system with a quantum computer was first raised in @xcite where heuristic methods were proposed , but no rigorous upper bounds have been derived ( for _ classical _ systems the problem was first raised in @xcite ) . our results set a universal upper bound @xmath0 for the thermalization time of a quantum system , where @xmath1 is the system s hilbert space dimension and @xmath2 is proportional to the helmholtz free energy density of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we present a quantum algorithm to evaluate the partition function of quantum systems within _ relative _ accuracy @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of the algorithm scales like the inverse of @xmath11 ( @xmath10 when the system is classical ) and proportionally to the thermalization time of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm is not affected by the sign problem and works for any locally interacting quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> it is a full quantum generalization of the algorithm presented in @xcite for the evaluation of partitions functions of classical systems . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of our two algorithms yields a universal upper bound for the time needed to evaluate a partition function with a quantum computer .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system composed of @xmath12 interacting @xmath13-level particles with a @xmath14-_local _ hamiltonian @xmath15 where each term @xmath16 has bounded norm and acts on at most @xmath14 particles ( @xmath14 is a constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most physically relevant case is of course @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it is one of quantum information science s most celebrated result that @xmath14-local hamiltonians can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , for those hamiltonians , the time evolution operator @xmath18 can be approximately expressed as the product of a sequence of discrete one- and two - qubit gates , and the number of gates scales essentially linearly with the duration @xmath19 of the simulated process and polynomially with the system size @xmath12 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given the system s hamiltonian and a temperature @xmath20 , we call a _ thermalization process _ any ( possibly time - dependent ) local hamiltonian on the system and a bath ( of size scaling polynomially with the number of particles in the system ) that generates , after time @xmath21 , a unitary transformation @xmath22 such that @xmath23 or more generally that this equation holds within some accuracy @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the system s thermalization time @xmath25 is the duration of the shortest thermalization process . </S>",
    "<S> note that in our definition , the temperature dependence is encoded in the details of @xmath22 instead of in the initial state of the bath as one would expect physically . </S>",
    "<S> this is to rule out trivial thermalization processes where the bath is prepared in the desired state @xmath26 and @xmath22 simply swaps the system and the bath . </S>",

    "<S> thermalization processes that occur in nature constitute of local interactions ( all forces of nature are two - body ) , so can be efficiently simulated by a quantum computer , i.e. , in a time proportional to the duration of the thermalization process @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we present a universal thermalization process and characterize its complexity . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show how to use this  or any other  </S>",
    "<S> thermalization process to evaluate partition functions with a quantum computer .    </S>",
    "<S> for sake of analysis , we shift the system s hamiltonian by a constant @xmath27 to ensure that @xmath28 is positive . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the partition function by a factor @xmath29 that we keep track of implicitly : we henceforth assume @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a known upper bound of the hamiltonian ( since @xmath28 is @xmath14-local , @xmath31 scales polynomially with the number of particles and can be straightforwardly upper bounded by triangle inequality ) . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath32 .    </S>",

    "<S> instead , we can produce @xmath35 that is a good approximation to it . </S>",
    "<S> this will unavoidably limit the accuracy of our thermalization process and of the estimated partition function . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , defining the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 ( by definition of @xmath19 , there is no multi - value problem ) , our algorithms will prepare the gibbs state @xmath37 and evaluate the partition function @xmath38 associated with @xmath39 , not @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show in appendix a that an accurate simulation @xmath40 leads to an accurate effective hamiltonian @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is a small constant ) . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , implies an accurate estimate of the partition function @xmath43 ( appendix b ) and a high fidelity gibbs state @xmath44 \\ge 1-k'\\beta e_{\\rm max}\\epsilon$ ] ( appendix c ) . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds can be understood intuitively by taking a first order expansion in the small @xmath3 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> because the exact time required to simulate @xmath34 within accuracy @xmath10 depends on the details of the system , we measure the complexity of our algorithms in terms of the number of times they need to implement @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the true running time of our algorithms have an additional arbitrarily weak dependence @xcite on the targeted accuracy @xmath10 of the partition function and gibbs state .    </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm requires a cooling schedule @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for all @xmath14 . writing @xmath47 where @xmath48 , we see that a polynomial - length cooling schedule can always be constructed by choosing @xmath49 , which implies a cooling schedule of length @xmath50 , but shorter schedules can be used in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> notice how the choice of a lower bound on the hamiltonian @xmath27 affects these ratios . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , it is desirable that @xmath51 be as close as possible to the true ground state energy of the system to decrease the length of the cooling schedule .    </S>",

    "<S> our universal thermalization process requires evaluating the @xmath54 sequentially : the fraction @xmath54 is evaluated from the gibbs state @xmath58 , and the value of @xmath59 is needed to prepare @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> our method makes use of quantum phase estimation ( qpe ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a transformation that operates on the  system \" register and an @xmath61-qubit `` energy '' register initialized to the state @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63 here , w denotes the hadamard transform @xmath64 and ft denotes the fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> the central gate applies @xmath65 repetitions of the time evolution operator @xmath34 to the system register , where @xmath65 is dictated by the state of the lower register . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath65 can be as large as @xmath66 , the running time of this procedure is @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the label @xmath68 runs over the discretization of the interval @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 . the function @xmath71 is the discrete fourier transform of @xmath72 , so it is highly peaked around the value @xmath73 , i.e. @xmath74 thus , qpe essentially measures the energy of the system and writes it down on the energy register , up to some fluctuations associated to the width of the function @xmath71 .    </S>",

    "<S> the term  marked \" refers to the fact that the energy register encodes the energy of each system eigenstate .    to obtain the state @xmath78 , we must first prepare the system and scratchpad in any maximally entangled state @xmath79 and then apply qpe to the system register ( ignoring fluctuations of @xmath80 ) . </S>",

    "<S> conclusion_we have presented a quantum algorithm to prepare the gibbs state of a quantum system in a time that grows like the @xmath145th power of the system s hilbert space dimension , where @xmath152 is proportional to the helmholtz free energy density @xmath138 at inverse temperature @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> we have demonstrated how the ability to thermalize a quantum system on a quantum computer leads to an algorithm to estimate its partition function with accuracy @xmath10 in a time proportional to the system s thermalization time and @xmath153 . </S>",
