    "in this contribution i wish to discuss some structural aspects of special relativity ( henceforth abbreviated sr ) which are , technically speaking , of a more advanced nature .",
    "most of what follows is well known , though generally not included in standard text - book presentations . against my original intention",
    ", i decided to not include those parts that relate to the representation- and field - theoretic aspects of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous lorentz group , but rather to be more explicit on those topics now covered .",
    "some of the abandoned material is ( rather informally ) discussed in @xcite .",
    "all of it will appear in @xcite .",
    "for a comprehensive discussion of many field - theoretic aspects , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "i always felt that special relativity deserves more attention than what is usually granted to it in courses on mechanics or electrodynamics .",
    "there is a fair amount of interesting algebraic structure that characterizes the transition between the galilei and lorentz group , and likewise there is some interesting geometry involved in the transition between newtonian ( or galilean ) spacetime and minkowski space .",
    "the latter has a rich geometric structure , notwithstanding the fact that , from a general relativistic viewpoint , it is ` just ' flat spacetime .",
    "i hope that my contribution will substantiate these claims . for the convenience of some interested readers",
    "i have included several mathematical appendices with background material that , according to my experience , is considered helpful being spelled out in some detail .",
    "for the purpose of this presentation i regard sr as the ( mathematical ) theory of how to correctly implement the _",
    "galilean relativity principle_henceforth simply abbreviated by rp .",
    "the rp is a physical statement concerning a subclass of phenomena  those not involving gravity  which translates into a mathematical symmetry requirement for the laws describing them .",
    "but there is no unique way to proceed ; several choices need to be made whose correctness can not be decided by mere logic .    given that the symmetry requirement is implemented by a group action ( which may be relaxed ; compare e.g. supersymmetry , which is not based on a group ) , the most fundamental question is : _ what group ? _ in this regard there is quite a convincing string of arguments that , given certain mild technical assumptions , the rp selects either the galilei or the lorentz group ( the latter for some yet undetermined velocity parameter @xmath0 ) .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in section[sec : impactrp ] .",
    "almost as important as the selection of a group is the question of how it should act on physical entities in question , like particles and fields",
    ". the importance and subtlety of this question is usually underestimated .",
    "let us therefore dwell a little on it .",
    "as an example we consider vacuum electrodynamics . here",
    "the mathematical objects that represent physical reality are two spacetime dependent fields , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which take values in a vector space isomorphic to @xmath3",
    ". there will be certain technical requirements on these fields , e.g. concerning differentiability and fall - off at spatial infinity , which we do not need to spell out here .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that the set of all fields obeying these conditions forms an infinite - dimensional linear space @xmath4 , which is sometimes called the space of ` kinematical ' ( or ` kinematically possible ' ) fields .",
    "those fields in @xmath4 which satisfy maxwell s ( vacuum ) equations form a proper subset , @xmath5 , which , due to the linearity of the equations and the boundary conditions ( fall - off to zero value , say ) , is a linear subspace .",
    "it is called the space of ` physical ' ( or ` dynamically possible ' ) fields .",
    "clearly these notions of the spaces of kinematically and dynamically possible fields apply to all sorts of situations in physics where one considers ` equations of motion ' , though in general neither of these sets will be a vector space .",
    "this terminology was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "in general , we say that a group @xmath6 is a _ symmetry group _ of a given dynamical theory if the following two conditions are satisfied :    * there exists an ( say left- ) effective action @xmath7 , @xmath8 , of @xmath6 on @xmath4 ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec : groupactions ] ) .",
    "posing effectiveness just means that we do not wish to allow trivial enlargements of the group by elements that do not move anything .",
    "it also means no loss of generality , since any action of a group @xmath6 on a set @xmath4 factors through an effective action of @xmath9 on @xmath4 , where @xmath10 is the normal subgroup of trivially acting elements ( cf .",
    "sect.[sec : groupactions ] ) .",
    "such an action of the group on the kinematical space of physical fields is also called an _ implementation _ of the group into the physical theory . *",
    "the action of @xmath6 on @xmath4 leaves @xmath11 invariant ( as a set , not necessarily pointwise ) , i.e. if @xmath12 then @xmath13 for all @xmath14 .",
    "this merely says that the group action restricts from @xmath4 to @xmath11 .",
    "note that , from an abstract point of view , this is the precise statement of the phrase ` leaving the field equations invariant ' , since the field equations are nothing but a characterization of the subset @xmath5 .",
    "if this were all there is to require for a group to count as a _ symmetry group _ , then we would probably be surprised by the wealth of symmetries in nature .",
    "for example , in the specific case at hand , vacuum electrodynamics , we often hear or read the statement that the lorentz group leaves maxwell s equations invariant , whereas the galilei group does not .",
    "is this really true ? has anyone really shown in this context that the galilei group can not effectively act on @xmath4 so as to leave @xmath11 invariant ?",
    "certainly not , because such an action is actually known to exist ; see e.g. chap.5.9 in @xcite .",
    "hence , in the general sense above , the galilei group _ is _ a symmetry group of maxwell s equations !",
    "the folklore statement just alluded to can , however , be turned into a true statement if a decisive restriction for the action is added , namely that it be _ local_.",
    "this means that the action on the space of fields is such that the value of the transformed field at the transformed spacetime point depends only on the value of the untransformed field at the untransformed point and _ not _ , in addition , on its derivatives .",
    "this is the crucial assumption that is implicit in all proofs of galilean - non - invariance of maxwell s equations and that is also made regarding the lorentz group in classical and quantum field theories .",
    "the action of the galilei group that makes it a symmetry group for maxwell s equations is , in fact , such that the transformed field depends linearly on the original field and its derivatives to _ all _ orders .",
    "that is , it is highly non local .",
    "returning to the general discussion , we now consider a classical field , that is , a map @xmath15 from spacetime @xmath16 into a vector space @xmath17 .",
    "a spacetime symmetry - group has an action on @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath18 , as well as an action on @xmath17 , which in most cases of interest is a linear representation @xmath19 of @xmath6 .",
    "a local action of @xmath6 on field space is then given by @xmath20 where here and below the symbol @xmath21 denotes composition of maps .",
    "this is the form of the action one usually assumes .",
    "existing generalizations concerning possible non - linear target spaces for @xmath22 and/or making @xmath22 a section in a bundle , rather than just a global function , do not influence the locality aspect emphasized here and will be ignored .    next to fields one also considers particles , at least in the classical theory .",
    "structureless ( e.g. no spin ) particles in spacetime are mathematically idealized by maps @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( or a subinterval thereof ) represents parameter space . the parameterization usually does not matter , except for time orientation , so any reparameterization @xmath25 with @xmath26 gives a reparameterized curve @xmath27 which is just as good . on the space of particles",
    ", the group @xmath6 acts as follows : @xmath28 together ( [ eq : g - actionfields ] ) and ( [ eq : g - actionparticles ] ) define an action on all the dynamical entities , that is particles and fields , which we collectively denote by the symbol @xmath29 .",
    "the given action of @xmath6 on that space is simply denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "now , the set of equations of motion for the whole system can be written in the general form @xmath31=0\\,,\\ ] ] where this should be read as a multi - component equation ( with @xmath32 being the zero ` vector ' in target space ) .",
    "@xmath33 stands collectively for non - dynamical entities ( background structures ) whose values are fixed by means independent of equation ( [ eq : eqmotion ] ) .",
    "it could , for example , be the minkowski metric in maxwell s equations and also external currents .",
    "the meaning of ( [ eq : eqmotion ] ) is to determine @xmath29 , _ given _",
    "@xmath33 ( and the boundary conditions for @xmath29 ) .",
    "we stress that @xmath33 is a constitutive part of the equations of motion .",
    "we now make the following    an action of the group @xmath6 on the space of dynamical entities @xmath29 is said to correspond to a _ symmetry _ of the equations of motion iff for all @xmath34 we have @xmath35=0\\ \\longleftrightarrow\\   \\mathcal{e}[\\sigma , g\\cdot\\phi]=0\\,.\\ ] ]    different form that is mere ` covariance ' , which is a far more trivial requirement .",
    "it arises if the space of background structures , @xmath33 , also carries an action of @xmath6 ( as it naturally does if the @xmath33 are tensor fields ) .",
    "then we have    an action of the group @xmath6 on the space of dynamical and non - dynamical entities @xmath29 and @xmath33 is said to correspond to a _ covariance _ of the equations of motion iff for all @xmath34 we have @xmath36=0\\ \\longleftrightarrow\\   \\mathcal{e}[g\\cdot\\sigma , g\\cdot\\phi]=0\\,.\\ ] ]    the difference to symmetries is that the background structures  and in that sense the equations of motion themselves  are changed too .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : def : symmetries ] ) says that if @xmath29 solves the equations of motion then @xmath37 solves the _ very same _ equations .",
    "in contrast , ( [ eq : def : invariance ] ) merely tells us that if @xmath29 solves the equations of motion then @xmath37 solves the appropriately transformed equations .",
    "trivially , a symmetry is also a covariance but the converse it not true .",
    "rather , a covariance is a symmetry iff it stabilizes the background structures , i.e. if for all @xmath34 we have @xmath38 .",
    "usually one has a good idea of what the dynamical entities @xmath29 in ones theory should be , whereas the choice of @xmath33 is more a matter of presentation and therefore conventional .",
    "after all , the only task of equations of motion is to characterize the set @xmath11 of dynamically possible fields ( and particles ) amongst the set @xmath4 of all kinematically possible ones .",
    "whether this is done by using auxiliary structures @xmath39 or @xmath40 should not affect the physics .",
    "it is for this reason that one has to regard the requirement of mere covariance as , physically speaking , rather empty .",
    "this is because one can always achieve covariance by suitably adding non - dynamical structures @xmath33 .",
    "let us give an example for this  @xcite .",
    "consider the familiar heat equation , @xmath41 here the dynamical field @xmath42 is the temperature function .",
    "the background structure is the 3-dimensional euclidean metric , @xmath43 , of space which enters the laplacian , @xmath44 ; hence @xmath45 .",
    "this equation possesses time translations and euclidean motions in space ( we neglect space reflections for simplicity ) as symmetries .",
    "these form the group @xmath46 , the semi - direct product of spatial translations and rotations .",
    "clearly @xmath47 stabilizes @xmath43 .",
    "but without changing the physics we can rewrite ( [ eq : heateq ] ) in the following spacetime form : let @xmath48 be inertial coordinates in minkowski space and @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) the ( covariant ) constant vector field describing the motion of the inertial observer .",
    "the components of the minkowski metric in these coordinates are denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "in our conventions ( ` mostly minus ' ) @xmath52 .",
    "then ( [ eq : heateq ] ) is clearly just the same as @xmath53 here the dynamical variable is still @xmath54 but the background variables are now given by @xmath55 .",
    "this equations is now manifestly covariant under the lorentz group if @xmath56 and @xmath57 are acted upon as indicated by their indices .",
    "hence we were able to enlarge the covariance group by enlarging the space of @xmath33s .",
    "in fact , we could even make the equation covariant under general diffeomorphisms by replacing partial with covariant derivatives .",
    "but note that the symmetry group would still be that subgroup that stabilizes ( leaves invariant ) the ( flat ) metric @xmath14 and the ( covariant constant ) vector field @xmath58 , which again results in the same symmetry group as for the original equation  ( [ eq : heateq ] ) . for more discussion concerning also the problematic aspects of of the notion of ` general covariance ' ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in the history of sr it has often been asked what the most general transformations of spacetime were that implemented the relativity principle ( rp ) , without making use of the requirement of the constancy of the speed of light .",
    "this question was first addressed by ignatowsky  @xcite , who showed that under a certain set of technical assumptions ( not consistently spelled out by him ) the rp alone suffices to arrive at a spacetime symmetry group which is either the galilei or the lorentz group , the latter for some yet undetermined limiting velocity @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , what is actually shown in this fashion is , as we will see , that the spacetime symmetry group must contain either the proper orthochronous galilei or lorentz group , if the group is required to comprise at least spacetime translations , spatial rotations , and boosts ( velocity transformations ) .",
    "what we hence gain is the group - theoretic insight of how these transformations must combine into a common group , given that they form a group at all .",
    "we do not learn anything about other transformations , like spacetime reflections or dilations , whose existence we neither required nor ruled out on this theoretical level .    the work of ignatowsky was put into a logically more coherent form by franck & rothe  @xcite@xcite , who showed that some of the technical assumptions could be dropped .",
    "further formal simplifications were achieved by berzi & gorini @xcite .",
    "below we shall basically follow their line of reasoning , except that we do not impose the continuity of the transformations as a requirement , but conclude it from their preservation of the inertial structure plus bijectivity .",
    "see also @xcite for an alternative discussion on the level of lie algebras .",
    "the principles of sr are mathematically most concisely expressed in terms of few simple structures put onto spacetime . in sr",
    "these structures are absolute in the sense of not being subject to any dynamical change . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", it seems rather a matter of convention whether one thinks of these structures as primarily algebraic or geometric . according to the idea advocated by felix klein in his ` erlanger programm '  @xcite ,",
    "a geometric structure can be characterized by its _ _ automorphism group__. the latter is generally defined by the subgroup of bijections of the set in question which leaves the geometric structure  e.g .",
    "thought of as being given in terms of relations  invariant .",
    "conversely , any transformation group ( i.e. subgroup of group of bijections ) can be considered as the automorphism group of some ` geometry ' which is defined via the invariant relations .",
    "the geometric structure of spacetime is not a priori given to us .",
    "it depends on the physical means on which we agree to measure spatial distances and time durations .",
    "these means refer to physical systems , like ` rods ' and ` clocks ' , which are themselves subject to dynamical laws in spacetime .",
    "for example , at a fundamental physical level , the spatial transportation of a rod or a clock from one place to another is certainly a complicated _ dynamical _ process .",
    "it is only due to the special definition of ` rod ' and ` clock ' that the result of such a process can be summarized by simple _",
    "kinematical _ rules .",
    "most importantly , their dynamical behavior must be ` stable ' in the sense of being essentially independent of their dynamical environment .",
    "hence there is always an implicit consistency hypothesis underlying operational definitions of spatio - temporal measurements , which in case of sr amount to the assumption that rods and clocks are themselves governed by lorentz invariant dynamical laws .",
    "a basic physical law is the law of inertia .",
    "it states the preference of certain types of motions for force - free , uncharged , zero - spin test - particles : the ` uniform ' and ` rectilinear ' ones . in the spacetime picture",
    "this corresponds to the preference of certain curves corresponding to the inertial worldlines of the force - free test particles . in the gravity - free case , we model these world lines by straight lines of the affine space @xmath59 over the vector space @xmath60",
    "this closely corresponds to our intuitive notion of homogeneity of space and time , that is , that there exists an effective and transitive ( and hence simply transitive ) action of the abelian group @xmath60 of translations ( cf .",
    "sects.[sec : groupactions ] and [ sec : affinespaces ] ) .",
    "a lot could ( and perhaps should ) be said at this point about the proper statement of the law of inertia and precisely how it endows spacetimes with certain geometric structures .",
    "instead we will simply refer the interested reader to the literature ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "note that we do not conversely assume any straight line to correspond to some inertial world - line .",
    "hence the first geometric structure on spacetime , which can be thought of as imposed by the law of inertia , is that of a subset of straight lines .",
    "if all straight lines were involved , the automorphism group of spacetime would necessarily have to map any straight line to a straight line and therefore be a subgroup of the affine group @xmath61 .",
    "this is just the content of the main theorem in affine geometry ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , we can only argue that it must map the subset of inertial world - lines onto itself .",
    "we take this subset to consist of all straight lines in @xmath59 whose slope with respect to some reference direction is smaller than a certain finite value @xmath62 .",
    "this corresponds to all worldlines not exceeding a certain limiting speed with reference to some inertial frame .",
    "it is then still true that any bijection of @xmath59 preserving that subset must be a subgroup of the affine group  @xcite . also , it is not necessary to assume that lines map surjectively onto lines  @xcite .    for further determination of the automorphism group of spacetime",
    "we invoke the following principles :    * homogeneity of spacetime .",
    "* isotropy of space .",
    "* galilean principle of relativity .",
    "we take st1 to mean that the sought - for group should include all translations and hence be of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a subgroup of @xmath65 .",
    "st2 is interpreted as saying that @xmath6 should include the set of all spatial rotations .",
    "if , with respect to some frame , we write the general element @xmath66 in a @xmath67 split form ( thinking of the first coordinate as time , the other three as space ) , we want @xmath64 to include all @xmath68 finally , st3 says that velocity transformations , henceforth called ` boosts ' , are also contained in @xmath64 .",
    "however , at this stage we do not know how boosts are to be represented mathematically .",
    "let us make the following assumptions :    * boosts @xmath69 are labeled by a vector @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the open ball in @xmath3 of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the physical interpretation of @xmath72 shall be that of the boost velocity , as measured in the system from which the transformation is carried out .",
    "we allow @xmath0 to be finite or infinite ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "@xmath74 corresponds to the identity transformation , i.e. @xmath75 . we also assume that @xmath72 , considered as coordinate function on the group , is continuous . * as part of st2 we require equivariance of boosts under rotations : @xmath76    the latter assumption allows us to restrict attention to boost in a fixed direction , say that of the positive @xmath77-axis .",
    "once their analytical form is determined as function of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , we deduce the general expression for boosts using ( [ eq : equivboostsrot ] ) and ( [ eq : so3imbedding ] ) .",
    "we make no assumptions involving space reflections . )",
    "explicitly , though they all use it ( implicitly ) , usually in statements to the effect that it is sufficient to consider boosts in one fixed direction . once this restriction is effected , a one - dimensional spatial reflection transformation is considered to relate a boost transformation to that with opposite velocity .",
    "this then gives the impression that reflection equivariance is also invoked , though this is not necessary in spacetime dimensions greater than two , for ( [ eq : equivboostsrot ] ) allows to invert one axis through a 180-degree rotation about a perpendicular one .",
    "] we now restrict attention to @xmath79 .",
    "we wish to determine the most general form of @xmath69 compatible with all requirements put so far .",
    "we proceed in several steps :    1 .   using an arbitrary rotation @xmath80 around the @xmath77-axis , so that @xmath81 , equation ( [ eq : equivboostsrot ] ) allows to prove that @xmath82 where here we wrote the @xmath83 matrix in a @xmath84 decomposed form .",
    "( i.e. @xmath85 is a @xmath86 matrix and @xmath87 is the @xmath86 unit - matrix ) .",
    "applying ( [ eq : equivboostsrot ] ) once more , this time using a @xmath88-rotation about the @xmath89-axis , we learn that @xmath90 is an even function , i.e. @xmath91 below we will see that @xmath92 .",
    "2 .   let us now focus on @xmath93 , which defines the action of the boost in the @xmath94 plane .",
    "we write @xmath95 we refer to the system with coordinates @xmath96 as @xmath97 and that with coordinates @xmath98 as @xmath99 . from ( [ eq : formboost3 ] ) and the inverse ( which is elementary to compute ) one infers that the velocity @xmath78 of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath97 and the velocity @xmath100 of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath99 are given by + [ eq : formboost4 ] @xmath101 + since the transformation @xmath102 is the inverse of @xmath103 , the function @xmath104 obeys @xmath105 hence @xmath106 is a bijection of the open interval @xmath107 onto itself and obeys @xmath108 3 .",
    "next we determine @xmath106 . once more using ( [ eq : equivboostsrot ] ) , where @xmath80 is a @xmath88-rotation about the @xmath89-axis , shows that the functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 in ( [ eq : formboost1 ] ) are even and the functions @xmath111 and @xmath0 are odd .",
    "the definition ( [ eq : formboost4b ] ) of @xmath106 then implies that @xmath106 is odd .",
    "since we assumed @xmath72 to be a continuous coordinatization of a topological group , the map @xmath106 must also be continuous ( since the inversion map , @xmath112 , is continuous in a topological group ) .",
    "a standard theorem now states that a continuous bijection of an interval of @xmath24 onto itself must be strictly monotonic .",
    "together with ( [ eq : formboost6 ] ) this implies that @xmath106 is either the identity or minus the identity map . to save notation , so that ( [ eq : formboost6 ] ) now reads @xmath113 . first assume that @xmath106 is strictly monotonically increasing",
    ", then @xmath114 implies @xmath115 , a contradiction , and @xmath116 implies @xmath117 , likewise a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath118 in this case .",
    "next assume @xmath106 is strictly monotonically decreasing . then @xmath119 is a strictly monotonically increasing map of the interval @xmath107 to itself that obeys ( [ eq : formboost6 ] ) .",
    "hence , as just seen , @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath121 . ]",
    "if it is the identity map , evaluation of ( [ eq : formboost5 ] ) shows that either the determinant of @xmath85 must equals @xmath122 , or that @xmath85 is the identity for all @xmath72 .",
    "we exclude the second possibility straightaway and the first one on the grounds that we required @xmath85 be the identity for @xmath123 .",
    "also , in that case , ( [ eq : formboost5 ] ) implies @xmath124 for all @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath121 , which implies that the relative velocity of @xmath97 with respect to @xmath99 is minus the relative velocity of @xmath99 with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "plausible as it might seem , there is no a priori reason why this should be so . and",
    "@xmath100 are measured with different sets of rods and clocks . ] .",
    "on the face of it , the rp only implies ( [ eq : formboost6 ] ) , not the stronger relation @xmath126 .",
    "this was first pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "4 .   we briefly revisit ( [ eq : formboosts2 ] ) . since we have seen that @xmath127 is the inverse of @xmath128 , we must have @xmath129 , so that ( [ eq : formboosts2 ] ) implies @xmath130 .",
    "but only @xmath131 is compatible with our requirement that @xmath132 be the identity .",
    "now we return to the determination of @xmath85 . using ( [ eq : formboost4 ] ) and @xmath121",

    "equation ( [ eq : formboost7 ] ) then allows to express @xmath111 in terms of @xmath109 : @xmath138\\,.\\ ] ] 6 .",
    "our problem is now reduced to the determination of the single function @xmath109 .",
    "this we achieve by employing the requirement that the composition of two boosts in the same direction results again in a boost in that direction , i.e. @xmath139 according to ( [ eq : formboost6b ] ) each matrix @xmath85 has equal diagonal entries .",
    "applied to the product matrix on the left hand side of ( [ eq : formboost10 ] ) this implies that @xmath140 is independent of @xmath78 , i.e. equal to some constant @xmath141 whose physical dimension is that of an inverse velocity squared .",
    "hence we have @xmath142 where we have chosen the positive square root since we require @xmath143 .",
    "the other implications of ( [ eq : formboost10 ] ) are + [ eq : formboost12 ] @xmath144 + from which we deduce @xmath145 conversely , ( [ eq : formboost11 ] ) and ( [ eq : formboost13 ] ) imply ( [ eq : formboost12 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that ( [ eq : formboost10 ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq : formboost11 ] ) and ( [ eq : formboost13 ] )",
    "so far a boost in @xmath77 direction has been shown to act non - trivially only in the @xmath94 plane , where its action is given by the matrix that results from inserting ( [ eq : formboost9 ] ) and ( [ eq : formboost11 ] ) into ( [ eq : formboost6b ] ) : @xmath146 * if @xmath147 we rescale @xmath148 and set @xmath149 .",
    "then ( [ eq : formboost14 ] ) is seen to be a euclidean rotation with angle @xmath90 in the @xmath150 plane .",
    "the velocity spectrum is the whole real line plus infinity , i.e. a circle , corresponding to @xmath151 $ ] , where @xmath32 and @xmath152 are identified .",
    "accordingly , the composition law ( [ eq : formboost13 ] ) is just ordinary addition for the angle @xmath90 .",
    "this causes several paradoxa when @xmath78 is interpreted as velocity .",
    "for example , composing two finite velocities @xmath153 which satisfy @xmath154 results in @xmath155 , and composing two finite and positive velocities , each of which is greater than @xmath156 , results in a finite but negative velocity . in this way",
    "the successive composition of finite positive velocities could also result in zero velocity .",
    "the group @xmath157 obtained in this fashion is , in fact , @xmath158 .",
    "this group may be uniquely characterized as the largest connected group of bijections of @xmath60 that preserves the euclidean distance measure .",

    "the same author systematically develops the intimate relation to hyperbolic geometry . a brief history of the research on these generalized algebraic structures is given in  @xcite .",

    "we interpret @xmath371 , @xmath372 , and @xmath450 as velocities of frames : @xmath371 is the velocity of frame2 with respect to ( i.e. measured in ) frame1 .",
    "@xmath372 is the velocity of frame3 with respect to frame2 . finally , @xmath450 is the velocity of frame3 with respect to frame1 .",
    "then , using ( [ eq : compboostsparam1 ] ) , it is easy to derive the following expressions for the moduli of @xmath450 and @xmath372 :    [ eq : compboostmodulus ] @xmath474    @xmath410 is the modulus of the relative velocity between frames 2 and 3 as function of the velocities of these frames with respect to a third one ( here frame1 ) .",
    "it may either be interpreted as velocity of frame3 with respect to frame2 , ( as above ) or as velocity of frame2 with respect to frame3 ( reciprocity of frame velocities , see sect.[sec : impactrp ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the right hand side of ( [ eq : compboostmodulus2 ] ) is symmetric under the exchange @xmath475 .",
    "even though the discussion of the geometry behind velocity composition belongs , strictly speaking , to the next , the geometry section , it is so intimately related to the discussion just given that it seems more appropriate to place the two right next to each other .    more precisely , the composition law for velocities is intimately related with hyperbolic geometry ( i.e. geometry on spaces with constant negative curvature ) , as was first pointed out by sommerfeld  @xcite , variak  @xcite@xcite , robb  @xcite , and borel  @xcite .",
    "more recently the subject was elaborated on by ungar  @xcite .",
    "the general reason is that the space of four - velocities @xmath476 is a 3-dimensional hyperbola in @xmath477 , whose induced metric , @xmath478 , is of constant negative curvature .",

    "( [ eq : def : rapidity ] ) ) is just the geodesic distance ) @xmath491 appears as geodesic distance to the center of the chosen system of spherical polar coordinates .",
    "however , since @xmath182 acts as a transitive group of isometries on @xmath479 , ( [ eq : eq : metricunithyppolar3 ] ) is valid no matter what point on @xmath479 is chosen for the center of coordinates . ] on the hyperbola @xmath479 of four - velocities with respect to the rescaled metric @xmath492 .",
    "this explains why the composition of velocities in the same direction is just ordinary addition if written in terms of rapidities ; compare the remark following equation ( [ eq : def : rapidity ] ) .",
    "the metric @xmath493 is also inherent in formula ( [ eq : compboostmodulus2 ] ) , which may also be read as endowing @xmath296 with a riemannian metric when applied to two infinitesimally nearby velocities @xmath494 and @xmath495 .",
    "then @xmath496 gives us the square of their distance , @xmath497 , for which we obtain @xmath498 which coincides with ( [ eq : metricunithyp ] ) . equation ( [ eq : compboostmodulus2 ] ) is the starting point in fock s discussion of the hyperbolic geometry of velocity space ( @xcite  17 ) .",
    "we also draw attention to a recent pedagogical discussion in @xcite and the systematic treatment in ch.7 of @xcite",
    ".    in this geometric setting the law ( [ eq : compboostmodulus1 ] ) for the modulus of the composed velocities just turns into the law for the length of the third side of a geodesic triangle as function of the length of the two other sides and the angle between them .",
    "this is most easily read off from ( [ eq : compboostsparam1 ] ) if rewritten in terms of rapidities , i.e. @xmath499 and @xmath500 : @xmath501 this is just the well known ` cosine - law ' for hyperbolic triangles , the connection of which with the law of composing velocities in sr was first pointed out by sommerfeld  @xcite and later , independently , by borel  @xcite .",
    "again we refer to @xcite for a modern and comprehensive treatment .    a beautiful application of the hyperbolic geometry of velocity space ( [ eq : def : fourvelhyp ] )",

    "the gyro s angular - momentum vector lies in this tangent plane and along the worldline it is fermi - walker transported .",

    "it is obvious that the action of @xmath578 ( spatial reflections are permitted ) on @xmath510 maps each of the six families of cones ( [ eq : affc ] ) into itself and therefore leave each of the six relations invariant . for example",

    "another set of ` obvious ' transformations of @xmath510 leaving these relations invariant is given by all dilations : @xmath584 where @xmath585 is the constant dilation - factor and @xmath586 the center .",
    "this follows from @xmath587 , @xmath588 , and the positivity of @xmath589 . since translations are already contained in @xmath578 , the group generated by @xmath578 and all @xmath590 is the same as the group generated by @xmath578 and all @xmath590 for fixed @xmath340 .",
    "a seemingly difficult question is this : what are the most general transformations of @xmath510 that preserve those relations ? here we understand ` transformation ' synonymously with ` bijective map ' , so that each transformation @xmath591 has in inverse @xmath592 . `",
    "preserving the relation ' is taken to mean that @xmath591 _ and _ @xmath592 preserve the relation .",
    "then the somewhat surprising answer to the question just posed is that , in three or more spacetime dimensions , there are no other such transformations besides those already listed :    let @xmath593 stand for any of the relations @xmath594 and let @xmath591 be a bijection of @xmath510 with @xmath595 , such that @xmath596 implies @xmath597 and @xmath598 .",
    "then @xmath591 is the composition of an lorentz transformation in @xmath578 with a dilation .",
    "these results were proven by a.d.alexandrov and independently by e.c .",
    "a good review of alexandrov s results is @xcite ; zeeman s paper is @xcite .",
    "the restriction to @xmath595 is indeed necessary , as for @xmath599 the following possibility exists : identify @xmath600 with @xmath601 and the bilinear form @xmath602 , where @xmath603 .",

    "hence it preserves the families of cones ( [ eq : def : affcausalc ] ) . since these transformations need not be affine linear they are not generated by dilations and lorentz transformations .",
    "these results may appear surprising since without a continuity requirement one might expect all sorts of wild behavior to allow for more possibilities .",
    "however , a little closer inspection reveals a fairly obvious reason for why continuity is implied here . consider the case in which a transformation @xmath591 preserves the families @xmath566 and @xmath612 .",

    "conversely , is is also easy to see that each open set of @xmath510 contains an open diamond .",
    "hence the topology that is defined by taking the @xmath615 as subbase ( the basis being given by their finite intersections ) is equivalent to the standard topology of @xmath510 .",

    "the answer is again in the negative .",

    "shows @xmath984 , which , according to lemma[lemma : noetherherglotz1 - 2 ] , implies that the motion is killing .",
    "next we turn to the second part of the theorem of noether and herglotz , which reads as follows :    [ thm : noetherherglotzp2 ] all irrotational rigid motions in minkowski space are given by the following construction : take a twice continuously differentiable curve @xmath985 in minkowski space , where w.l.o.g @xmath899 is the eigentime , so that @xmath986 .",

    "in fact , the acceleration one - form field for ( [ eq : proof : noeterherglotz2c ] ) is @xmath1022 from which one easily computes @xmath1023 from this one sees , for example , that for _ constant acceleration _ , defined by @xmath1024 ( constant acceleration in time as measured in the instantaneous rest frame ) , we have @xmath984 and hence a killing motion . clearly , this is just the motion ( [ eq : boostkill2 ] ) for the boost killing field ( [ eq : boostkill1 ] ) .",
    "the lie derivative of @xmath962 is now easily obtained : @xmath1025 showing explicitly that it is not zero except for motions of constant acceleration , which were just seen to be killing motions .",

    "however , this hope was soon realized to be physically untenable  @xcite .",

    "the hypersurfaces of simultaneity were given by the hyperplanes of constant killing time @xmath589 , which are different from the ( curved ) hypersurfaces of constant proper time @xmath899 .",
    "this worked because the killing field was ( locally ) hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "note that in terms of the co - rotating coordinates @xmath1026 ( recall that @xmath1027 ) the killing field ( [ eq : rotkill1 ] ) is just @xmath1028 .",

    "the rotational killing field is clearly not hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "the obstruction is just given by the vorticity @xmath916 .",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath1033 hence the obstruction for hypersurface orthogonality is likewise faithfully measured by @xmath445 .",
    "moreover , as we shall see below , the 1-form @xmath445 has an interesting physical and geometric interpretation , which is the actual reason why we introduced it here .    inside the region @xmath856 ( defined in ( [ eq : regionomega ] ) )",
    "@xmath97 is a complete and nowhere vanishing timelike vector field .",
    "this means that the flow @xmath1034 of @xmath97 defines a free action of the additive group @xmath24 on @xmath856 that makes @xmath856 the total space of a principle bundle with fiber @xmath24 and base @xmath1035 . here @xmath617 is again the equivalence relation which declares two points in @xmath856 to be equivalent iff they lie on the same @xmath97 orbit .",

    "a striking consequence of the non - transitivity of einstein synchronization is the non - zero lapse of coordinate time that one obtains for spatially closed curves .",
