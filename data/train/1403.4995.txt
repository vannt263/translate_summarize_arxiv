    "the results of these calculations were used to determine the spatial distribution of charged particles escaping the boron films and the photon collection efficiency of the experimental apparatus .    the number of photons incident on the pmt depended upon the number of photons produced in the reaction cell , the spatial distribution of those emissions , the probability with which the photons were reflected from adjacent surfaces , and the type of reflection they underwent ( i.e. , specular or diffuse ) .",
    "some photons intersected the pmt directly ; others were reflected into the pmt from the surfaces surrounding the reaction volume ; and a large majority were absorbed by the interior surfaces of the cylinder surrounding the @xmath0b film without reaching the detector . the simplest model for the calculation of detector collection efficiency",

    "a monte carlo routine was developed to incorporate the extended photon emission volume , the geometry of the reaction volume , the reflectivities of the various surfaces , and the measured position - dependent sensitivity of the pmt photocathode .",

    "an emission position was generated from a uniform and random distribution over the volume of a hemisphere tilted at 45@xmath9 with respect to the detector plane .",
    "a direction for the photon path was then calculated from a uniform random distribution .",
    "subsequently , the intersection of the path with one of the three surrounding surfaces ( i.e. , @xmath0b film , black copper - oxide cylinder , and detector face ) determined whether the photon was collected , reflected , or absorbed .",
    "photons striking the @xmath0b surface were specularly reflected with a reflection coefficient of 0.35 , derived from measurements in @xcite .",
    "photons striking the copper - oxide cylinder were diffusely reflected with a probability of 0.01 , derived from measurements in @xcite .",

    "error bars represent combined uncertainties from various inputs as described in table [ table1 ] . ]    at 80 kpa for ar , 53 kpa for kr , and 40 kpa for xe , nge emissions reached a plateau , indicating that at these gas pressures no charged particle energy was lost to the cell walls , and the photon emission volumes were produced completely within the line - of - sight of the photon detector .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by the results of the trim simulations discussed above .",
    "additionally , nge yields decreased with increasing target thickness due to the larger average energy loss of charged particles escaping thicker films .",
    "the saturation pressures were dependent on the geometry of our reaction cell ( i.e. , the radius of the photocathode and the distance of the chamber walls from the location of charged - particle emission ) . in the saturation region , when the photon emission volume was small and well defined , photon yields depended only on the properties of the neutron absorbing targets and not on the remaining detector geometry .    to understand the excimer photon yield per captured neutron , excimer production and decay must be considered . as",
    "energetic charged particles travel through noble gases , they deposit their energy by excitation and ionization of the surrounding noble gas atoms .",
    "these processes include , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a charged particle , @xmath89 is a noble gas atom , @xmath90 is an electron , @xmath91 is an ionized noble gas atom , @xmath92 is a charged particle of reduced energy , and @xmath93 is a noble gas atom in an excited electronic state @xcite .",
    "excited noble - gas atoms may decay through the radiative emission of a fuv photon ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95    at increased pressures ( 103 pa to 104 pa ) , the probability of another atom reabsorbing this atomic photon increases , and the photons become  trapped  within the gas volume .",
    "independently , the likelihood of three - body collisions also increases at higher pressures , leading to excimer formation , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a nge .",
    "this reaction occurs on a time scale of @xmath98 s to @xmath99 s @xcite .",
    "the excimers may then decay by emitting a photon , @xmath100    variations in the amount of energy carried away by the third body , as in equation 16 , and the repulsive nature of the molecular ground state enable nge emissions to occur over broad molecular continua .",
    "spontaneous radiative decay times for simple excimers fall between 0.005 @xmath28s and 5 @xmath28s @xcite .",
    "comparatively , dissociation times for weakly bound molecular ground states may be as short as @xmath101 s , on the timescale of a single molecular vibration .",
    "this range of decay times is attributed to the different transition probabilities between the excimer singlet and triplet states and the singlet ground state .",
    "the forbidden triplet to singlet - state transition may have a characteristic decay time two orders of magnitude longer than the singlet to singlet - state decay .",
    "collisions play an important role in the decay process , thus decay times are strongly dependent on gas pressure @xcite . at higher pressures , triplet - singlet transitions , aided by electronic and atomic collisions , occur with increased probability . therefore ,",
    "both the formation and the decay of excimers are more rapid at high gas pressures .",
    "the observed excimer scintillation signals from the @xmath0b(n,@xmath1)@xmath2li reaction are comparable to the yields of some liquid and solid neutron scintillators ( for yields of other scintillators see @xcite ) .",
    "the low densities of noble gases in these experiments translate to gamma sensitivities that are inherently lower than liquid and solid scintillators .",
    "we attribute the increase in the scintillation yield with noble gas pressure to the increased frequency of interactions between charged - particle reaction products and noble gas atoms , and the increased probability of three - body excimer - forming collisions .",
    "the results of this work indicate the potential for nge to provide an efficient means of neutron detection .",
    "the results also suggest ways in which to modify the current arrangement to greatly increase detection efficiency .",
    "the @xmath0b films used in these experiments absorbed at most 8 % of the incident neutrons .",
    "thicker films will lead to increased absorption , but will also attenuate the average energy of the emerging ions . to avoid this attenuation ,",
    "@xmath0b films may be stacked in an array .",
    "while absorption in any single film will be small , the total absorption through an array of 30 @xmath0b films , 1 @xmath28 m thick , for example , approaches 80 % . in the present experiment ,",
    "ions emitted toward the silicon substrate are often absorbed by it . as a result",
    ", the ion yield is reduced by approximately 50 % . supporting the @xmath0b films on structures that allow the unimpeded passage of the product ions can increase efficiency .    a very large increase in efficiency",
    "can also be attained by increasing the solid angle subtended by the photon detector , the quantum efficiency of the photon detector , and the reflectivity of the surfaces in the reaction cell . increasing the solid angle may be accomplished with large area detectors placed close to the @xmath0b film target . while this is not practical with existing fuv pmts , rapid advances in extending the short wavelength sensitivity of large silicon photomultipliers promise to produce practical devices that can be used to detect the fuv photons with high efficiency over a large solid angle @xcite . additionally , the reflectivity and shapes of the reaction cell surfaces may be further optimized for efficient photon collection .",
