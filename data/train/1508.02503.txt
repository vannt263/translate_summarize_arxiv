    "slow time variations of system parameters across continuous transitions inevitably lead to off - equilibrium behaviors , giving rise to the so - called kibble - zurek ( kz ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a typical example is provided by a linear change of the temperature across its transition value @xmath0 , such as @xmath6 starting from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where @xmath2 controls the speed of the temperature variation . the emergence of off - equilibrium phenomena is essentially related to the fact that continuous transitions develop correlations with diverging length scale , which can not adapt themselves to the variations of the temperature , even in the regime of slow variations . however , in the limit of large @xmath2 , the system develops an off - equilibrium scaling behavior involving @xmath2 , which is controlled by the same critical exponents of the system at equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "this issue has been also extended to quantum transitions , obtaining analogous behaviors when quasi - adiabatic changes of an external parameter go through continuous quantum transitions  @xcite .",
    "several experiments have investigated these off - equilibrium phenomena , in particular checking the predictions for the abundance of residual defects arising from the off - equilibrium conditions across @xmath0 , as predicted by the kz mechanism , see , e.g. , refs .  .",

    "unlike continuous transitions , the length scale of the correlations in the thermodynamic limit ( within each phase ) remains finite when approaching @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , we show that off - equilibrium scaling behaviors , analogous to the kz scaling at continuous transitions , may also arise at fots when slowly varying the temperature across @xmath0 , in systems with appropriate boundary conditions favoring the presence of an interface .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath9-state potts models provide an ideal theoretical laboratory to investigate issues related to fots driven by the temperature ( when @xmath10 ) .",
    "we consider the off - equilibrium behavior arising from a relaxational dynamics with a time - dependent temperature @xmath11 crossing @xmath0 , such as @xmath12 .",
    "we show that , when slowly crossing the fot , i.e. , for large time scales @xmath2 , the off - equilibrium behavior turns out to be dependent on the geometry and boundary conditions .",
    "this is essentially related to the dependence of the equilibrium relaxational dynamics at fots on the boundary conditions .",
    "for symmetric boundary conditions , such as periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , systems of size @xmath13 are characterized by an exponentially slow dynamics due to an exponentially large tunneling time @xmath14 between the coexisting phases . on the other hand ,",
    "power - law behaviors characterize the slow dynamics when mixed boundary conditions ( mbc ) are considered , i.e. , when the boundary conditions at two opposite sides of the system are related to the different high-@xmath11 and low-@xmath11 phases , effectively generating an interface .",
    "we argue that the mbc settings lead to a power - law off - equilibrium scaling behavior involving the time scale @xmath2 of the slow temperature variation across the fot point .",

    "we focus on the possibility of nontrivial off - equilibrium scaling behaviors driven by slow changes of the temperature , analogous to those arising at continuous transitions , leading to the kz mechanism  @xcite . when slowly varying the temperature across a continuous transition , for example linearly as @xmath199 , the kz mechanism predicts a nontrivial off - equilibrium scaling behavior in the limit of slow variations , due to the diverging length scale at @xmath0 .",
    "we show that phenomena analogous to the kz off - equilibrium scaling emerge also at fots , when appropriate boundary conditions are considered .",
    "we consider the 2d potts models , which provide an ideal testing ground to investigate issues related to fots . in our discussion",
    "we consider a purely relaxational dynamics such as that obtained by heat - bath and metropolis upgrading in mc simulations .",
    "we study the off - equilibrium behavior in the case of a time - dependent temperature crossing the fot .",
    "in particular , we consider a linear dependence of the inverse temperature @xmath200 , starting from the high-@xmath11 or low-@xmath11 phase .",
    "we point out that off - equilibrium behaviors at fots are extremely sensitive to the geometry and boundary conditions of the system .",
    "this peculiar dependence is essentially related to the equilibrium relaxational dynamics at @xmath0 .",
    "for symmetric boundary conditions , such as pbc , we expect an exponentially slow dynamics due to an exponentially large tunneling time @xmath14 . on the other hand , a power - law slowing down @xmath94 with @xmath201",
    "is found when considering mbc , i.e. , when the boundary conditions at two opposite sides of the system are related to the different high-@xmath11 and low-@xmath11 phases , effectively generating an interface separating the coexisting phases .",
    "we argue that an off - equilibrium scaling behavior around @xmath3 ( i.e. , the time corresponding to @xmath0 ) is realized for mbc .",
    "this is controlled by the corresponding equilibrium length - scale and dynamic exponents .",
    "we argue that this scaling behavior is essentially related to the dynamics of the interface enforced by mbc .    in the case of slab - like geometries with mbc , the numerical results for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 potts model support the emergence of an off - equilibrium scaling picture characterized by power - law behaviors , analogous to those predicted by the kz theory at continuous transitions .",
    "on the other hand , symmetric boundary conditions do not apparently lead to nonanalytic scaling behaviors at @xmath3 , but rather to a delayed sharp relaxation to the other phase at @xmath202 with @xmath203 , which may be related to a metastability phenomenon arising from the slow dynamics across the fot .",
    "this point deserves further investigation to physically understand it .",
    "further checks of the observed asymptotic behavior may also be called for .",
    "indeed , we can not exclude the possibility that a different ( logarithmic ) asymptotic behavior sets in for sizes and time scales larger than those considered in our numerical analysis , which are @xmath165 and @xmath154 .",
    "our scaling arguments are quite general , therefore they should also apply to higher - dimensional systems , such as the 3d potts models that undergo fots .",

    "in particular , we again expect that geometries and boundary conditions favoring the emergence of an interface should give rise to off - critical scaling behaviors similar to those of the kz theory at continuous transitions .",
    "this issue calls for further investigation .",
    "off - equilibrium scaling behaviors may also appear at fots driven by magnetic fields .",
    "for example , one may consider o(@xmath208)-symmetric spin models in the low-@xmath11 ordered phase , where fots are driven by an external magnetic field coupled to the spin variables .",
    "then , one may consider the off - equilibrium dynamics driven by a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath209 across the transition point @xmath210 .",
    "we expect that in the case of ising models ( @xmath211 ) an off - equilibrium scaling behavior may emerge in systems with boundary conditions enforcing the presence of an interface , analogously to what is observed at the thermal fots of the 2d potts models . in the case of a continuous symmetry ( @xmath212 ) , off - equilibrium scaling behavior may emerge from the spin - wave dynamics ( goldstone modes related to the broken o(@xmath208 ) symmetry )  @xcite .",
    "we believe that these issues are worth being further investigated .",
    "one may also consider evolutions different from the purely relaxational ones .",
    "they would generally lead to other values of the dynamic exponent  @xmath67 .",
    "we also mention that off - equilibrium behaviors arising from sudden quenches below and at the transition point have been discussed in several works , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "off - equilibrium behaviors at fots are quite general , they should be observable in many physical contexts where the fots are approached by varying the system parameters . the off - equilibrium protocol investigated in this paper may be exploited to probe the main features of systems at the fot . moreover , our results may turn out useful in understanding more complicated off - equilibrium phenomena at fots . for example , as a case of physical interest we mention the effects of the intrinsic space - time inhomogeneity of the quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , whose equilibrium @xmath11-@xmath213 ( @xmath213 is the chemical potential ) phase diagram is expected to have a fot line  @xcite which may be crossed during heavy - ion collisions .",

    "analogous off - equilibrium phenomena should be also observable in quantum many - body systems , at first - order quantum transitions .",
