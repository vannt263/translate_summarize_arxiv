    "the stacking technique aims at obtaining high photometric sensitivity , while strongly reducing the systematic defects that arise in individual observations from flat field inhomogeneities and scattered light from `` polluting '' ( fore- and background ) sources .",
    "this is achieved by averaging a large number of images of different targets , where the unwanted sources are efficiently masked .",
    "typical required number of images is several hundreds , hence the need for a large imaging database as the sdss .",
    "the results obtained from the stacking of a large number of clusters grant a high statistical significance , but have the disadvantage of lacking information about substructure and cluster - to - cluster variations , that must be derived from the analysis of different subsamples .",

    "we have used the max - bcg cluster finder algorithm developed by j. annis to select clusters in the same richness range as the abell catalogue , between @xmath8 and 0.3 .",
    "the redshift constraint has been introduced to limit the size of the stacked images to a single sdss frame , thus avoiding to mosaic images with different background properties for a given cluster .",
    "moreover , at the median @xmath9 of the sample the @xmath10 colour conveniently maps the 4000  break , providing valuable information about the intracluster stellar population .    lacking any kinematic characterisation , we _ define _ as icl all the flux beyond the isophote 25 mag arcsec@xmath4 ( observed @xmath2-band ) of any galaxy .",
    "all galaxies , except the central brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) , are masked to this extent .",
    "bright stars are masked out to 3 times the isophotal radius , to prevent their bright haloes being included in the stacking .",
    "images are then centred on the bcg , size - rescaled to the same metric radius , and intensity - rescaled to the same photometric calibration , corrected for galactic extinction and cosmological sb dimming . a simple average of the masked images is then computed ( stacked image ) .",
    "a stacking of images where only the brightest stars were masked has been performed as well , to obtain a map of the total luminosity of the cluster to be compared to the icl .",
    "we have tested the efficiency of our masking algorithm and quantified the fraction of galaxy light which fails to be masked .",
    "realistic sb distribution have been used to simulate galaxies in the same observed conditions as for real clusters , with different luminosity functions ( lfs ) parametrised  la schechter .",
    "depending on the adopted parameters ( and particularly on the powerlaw slope of the faint end @xmath11 ) we find that 5 to 20 - 25% of the light in galaxies can be missed .",
    "as we will show below , this effect can be used along with other observational constraints to put limits to the faint end slope of the lf .",

    "it is remarkable that the distribution of galaxies is less aligned with the bcg and/or less flattened than the icl .",
    "this may indicate that the intracluster stars are stripped more efficiently from galaxies that move along radial orbits aligned with the main axis of the bcg .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the icl sb and luminosity on cluster richness and bcg luminosity .",
    "the sb of the icl is enhanced in rich clusters and in those having a luminous bcg , and _",
    "vice versa_. the clusters with the faintest bcgs appear particularly deficient in icl .",
    "however , the relative contribution of icl to the total luminosity within 500 kpc is roughly constant 11% for all clusters .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see also merritt 1984 , moore et al .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that des and the icl share the same origin .",
    "the broadband colours are consistent with this scenario , and the fact that the total luminosity of des is similar to that of the icl is very intriguing too .",
    "on the other hand , if des are the remnants of the galaxies from which a large number of stars have been stripped into the intergalactic space , we should expect ( i ) that in anisotropic clusters des display a similar flat and aligned distribution as the icl , in addition to some degree of radial orbital anisotropy ; and ( ii ) that the luminosity function of des correlates with the amount of icl .",
    "the study of these correlations between icl and des may therefore provide invaluable clues on the origins of these two components and on the violent history of galaxy clusters .",
    "in all the analysis conducted above , the measured diffuse light is converted into `` real '' icl assuming that the fraction of galaxy light that is left unmasked is 15% , according to our simulations for a lf as in coma . as already mentioned , by varying the parameters of the lf values between 5 and 20 - 25% are found .",
    "however we have a number of constraints that limit the range of variation to @xmath215% around the assumed 15% .",
    "@xmath22 is constrained within a few hundredths of mag by directly observed number counts . on the other hand ,",
    "if a too steep lf is chosen , then the predicted unmasked flux becomes larger than the actual flux in the diffuse component .",
    "in particular , if we assume that the lf is independent of radius , then the minimum value of the local fraction of diffuse light represents the maximum fraction of light that might be missed by our masks . since this fraction is 20% at @xmath23 kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ profiles]a ) , we calculate that the faint - end powerlaw of a simple schechter lf can not be steeper than @xmath24 .",
