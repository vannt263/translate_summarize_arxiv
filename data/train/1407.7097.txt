    "digital communication systems in wireless channels have been studied extensively ( refer to @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . besides the well - investigated rayleigh , rician , and nakagami-@xmath1 channels , the lognormal fading",
    "is widely recognized as an important channel model because it fits empirical fading measurements well in many transmission scenarios of practical interest @xcite . for examples ,",
    "the lognormal fading can characterize the shadowing effects in outdoor rf communications @xcite and describe indoor radio propagation environments .",
    "the lognormal fading is also suitable for describing ultra - wideband channels @xcite and characterizing optical wireless communication ( owc ) links in clear sky over several hundred meters @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "performance analysis of digital communication systems over the lognormal channels remains challenging and mathematically intractable .",
    "the error rate analysis of such systems typically involves numerical integration @xcite or approximation @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the achievable finite diversity order of the lognormal channels in relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regimes .",
    "however , their result is not valid when the snr is asymptotically large since the diversity order for the lognormal channels is widely known to be @xmath2 .",
    "due to this fact , the asymptotic theory @xcite can not be applied directly to the lognormal channels .",
    "binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) is an important benchmark modulation scheme whose bit - error rate ( ber ) performance over fading channels is well - known @xcite , @xcite . for coherent demodulation",
    ", bpsk requires channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver in order to achieve its optimal performance .",
    "when the required csi can not be tracked accurately , binary differential phase - shift keying ( dpsk ) is an attractive alternative with inferior ber performance .",
    "it is well - known that dpsk is 3 db worse than bpsk in rayleigh channels in high snr regimes @xcite .",
    "one fundamental question we aim to answer is what the performance loss of dpsk with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "bpsk will be in the lognormal channel at high snr .    in this letter",
    ", we prove that in the lognormal fading dpsk and bpsk have the same asymptotic ber performance , and differential quaternary phase - shift keying ( dqpsk ) is exactly @xmath0 db worse than quaternary phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) in high snr regimes .",
    "for a digital communication system over fading channels , the snr can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average snr is the average snr . in owc with direct detection , @xmath4 is known as the electrical snr @xcite . ] and @xmath5 is the channel gain .",
    "the asymptotic ber @xmath6 as @xmath7 can be obtained by averaging the conditional ber @xmath8 over the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath9 , and it is approximated by @xcite @xmath10 where a function @xmath11 is @xmath12 if @xmath13 .",
    "equation can be obtained from the taylor series expansion of the snr pdf where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are finite constants .",

    ", we normalize the mean of @xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath36 = \\exp(\\mu + \\sigma^2/2 ) = 1 $ ] and thus @xmath37 ) and obtain the pdf of @xmath5 as @xmath38 the parameter @xmath39 is associated with the severity of fading . for owc applications ,",

    "we require pdf of the receiver snr . this pdf can be obtained by changing variables in as @xmath42 which is another lognormal pdf .",
    "our goal is to study the asymptotic relative ber performance between coherent and differentially coherent modulation schemes over the lognormal channels . while it is infeasible to perform asymptotic analysis directly on the lognormal channels , we introduce the lognormal - nakagami fading as an auxiliary channel model where the receiver snr follows a lognormal - gamma distribution . unlike the lognormal pdf",
