    "galaxy interactions and major mergers are currently the most popular explanation for energetically active galactic centers ( e.g. , jogee 2005 ) , commonly termed active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . both the frequency of disturbed morphologies and the presence of agn correlate with the host galaxy s ir luminosity ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . however , using measures such as concentration , rotational asymmetry ( _ c _ , _ a _ ; conselice 2003 ) , and near  neighbor frequency , some studies failed to find a correlation between x - ray  selected agn and galaxy interactions ( e.g. , grogin et al . 2003 , 2005 , hereafter g03 , g05 ) .",
    "thus , galaxy interactions may correlate more strongly with ir ",
    "luminous agn or may be less apparent for x - ray - luminous agn .",
    "recent galaxy merger simulations also suggest a connection between disturbed morphologies , agn , and hard x - ray spectra ( e.g. , dimatteo , springel , & hernquist 2005 , hereafter dsh05 ; hopkins et al .  2005a , 2005b , hereafter h05a , h05b ) .    the gini coefficient , which measures the distribution of flux amongst a galaxy s pixels ( _ g _ ; abraham 2003 ) , and the second - order moment of the brightest @xmath1 of a galaxy s flux ( @xmath2 ; lotz , primack , & madau 2004 , hereafter lpm04 ) , have been shown to be robust to high @xmath5 for determining the morphologies of potentially disturbed objects . in particular , @xmath2 is more sensitive to merger signatures than other measures of concentration . morphologically undisturbed galaxies form a well - defined sequence , correlated with hubble type , in the @xmath6 plane ; merging and interacting galaxies",

    "2002 ) , we created a spectroscopic sample of galaxies with @xmath11 and spectroscopic redshifts @xmath0 .",

    "the @xmath45 statistics are consistent with those found by g05 .",
    "our finding that most x - ray  selected agn are hosted by e / s0/sa galaxies is consistent with previous findings that agn tend to be hosted by massive ellipticals or bulge - dominated galaxies ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",

    "it is also consistent with their red and luminous positions on the color - magnitude diagram ( nandra et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "x - ray  selected agn hosted by e / s0/sa galaxies tend to have softer x - ray spectra ( h - s)/(h+s ) ; h@xmath46 kev counts ; s@xmath47 kev counts . at @xmath48 , hr @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) indicates high ( low ) attenuation of soft - band x - rays by gas and dust . due to redshifting of the energy bands ,",

    "however , the detection of soft spectra from four x - ray  selected agn hosted by morphologically disturbed galaxies may indicate surprisingly low levels of obscuration .",
    "seven of the 48 ( @xmath53 ) x - ray  selected agn in the spectroscopic sample are associated with kinematic pairs ; in comparison , @xmath54 of field galaxies are associated with kinematic pairs .",
    "our results suggest that the x - ray sources have a higher companion rate by a factor @xmath4 ( @xmath42 result ) . this is greater than that found by g05 ; however , we find that the companion pairing rate decreases if we only use projected separation to identify pairs .",
    "most x - ray  selected agn in kinematic pairs are hosted by relatively undisturbed early - type galaxies .",
    "ir  selected agn inhabit host galaxies of all types , as shown by the @xmath6 classification of the ir  selected agn hosts in figure 2",
    ". a two - dimensional k ",
    "s test ( ff87 ) is consistent with the ir  selected agn hosts and field galaxies being drawn from the same population ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 results similarly indicate little morphological distinction between ir  selected agn hosts and the field galaxies .",
    "visual classification results suggest a slight shift from sc / d / irr hosts to e / s0/sa hosts ( table 1 ) .",
    "two of the 11 ir  selected agn in the spectroscopic sample are associated with kinematic pairs , hinting that kinematic pairs may be more common among ir  selected agn than the field galaxies ( cf .  ",
    "3.1 ) , but this result is statistically weak in our small sample .",
    "the relatively high fraction of x - ray  selected agn in kinematic pairs supports models that predict that galaxy interactions are responsible for the activation of some galactic nuclei ( e.g. , dsh05 , h05ab ) .",
    "however , most agn are found in undisturbed , isolated systems , implying that interactions may not be the main method by which agn are turned on or that the timescales for interactions and agn activity differ significantly from what is suggested by simulations .",
    "x - ray and ir agn selection methods select agn with different host galaxy morphologies . a two - dimensional k  s test ( ff87 ) is inconsistent with the x - ray and ir  selected agn hosts being drawn from the same population ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "ir selection via a power - law misses many agn hosted by e / s0/sa galaxies ; although all x - ray  selected agn with @xmath11 and @xmath0 are detected by irac , most do not have power - law seds ( see also barmby et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who found that only @xmath57 of _ chandra _ sources have irac power laws ) .",
    "x - ray selection misses many agn hosted by sc / d / irr galaxies . using the agn with @xmath11 and @xmath0 that are selected by both x - ray and ir methods , @xmath58 ( consistent with elvis et al .",
    "1994 , table 15 ) ; this predicts detectable x - ray emission from the ir  selected agn , yet many of these objects are not detected by _",
    "the disparity between the morphologies of x - ray and ir  selected agn suggests that the methods may select agn at different stages or orientations with varied levels of gas , that galaxy light from the hosts of some x - ray  selected agn may overwhelm the ir emissions ( so that the measured ir emissions do not follow a power - law ) , or that star - forming field galaxies are contaminating the ir  selected agn sample .",
    "the observation of soft x - ray spectra from four x - ray  selected agn hosted by morphologically interacting galaxies may contradict predictions from h05b that soft x - rays from agn hosted by interacting galaxies should be highly attenuated .",
    "however , most of our x - ray  selected agn are less luminous than the qso simulated by hopkins ( 2006ab ) . though it is not surprising that many x - ray  selected agn hosted by e / s0/sa galaxies have soft spectra , soft x - ray  selected agn hosted by interacting galaxies are unexpected .",
    "dissipationless mergers would explain unobscured nuclei but would be unlikely to provide enough gas to trigger agn .",
    "thus , the observed interactions were probably not responsible for these agn .",
