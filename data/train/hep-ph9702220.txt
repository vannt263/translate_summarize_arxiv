    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on protons are used as a tool to gain information about the structure of the proton . a neutral current ( nc )",
    "reaction of the type @xmath1 is interpreted naively as a process in which the electron radiates a virtual gauge boson , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which probes the structure of the proton . for low enough virtualities , expressed by the negative square of the four momentum transfer at the lepton vertex @xmath4",
    ", one can neglect the @xmath3 exchange .",
    "thus we say that the virtual photon @xmath5 is ` looking ' at the proton and probing its structure .",
    "there is no question as to who ` looks ' at who and thus if some structure is observed , it is attributed to the proton .",
    "the reason one does so is because one assumes that @xmath5 has no structure .",
    "how well is this assumption justified ?",
    "real photons are known to acquire structure when interacting with a proton .",
    "a photon fluctuates into a @xmath6 pair and as long as the fluctuation time @xmath7 is much larger than the interaction time @xmath8 the photon interacts with the proton through the @xmath6 pair  @xcite .",
    "a photon of energy @xmath9 has a fluctuation time of : @xmath10 while the interaction time is determined by the radius @xmath11 of the proton : @xmath12 .",
    "a virtual photon of virtuality @xmath4 has a much shorter fluctuation time given by : @xmath13 and thus does not have enough time to build up a structure before interacting with the proton .",
    "however at small @xmath0 ( the bjorken scaling variable ) , the simple picture of dis is complicated by the long chain of gluon and quark ladders which describes the process in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . in this long chain of partons along the ladder , where does one draw the line ?",
    "does one study the structure of the proton ?",
    "of the photon ?",
    "does it make at all sense to speak about the structure of virtual photons after the argument mentioned in the earlier paragraph where it was shown that the fluctuation time decreases with @xmath4 ?",
    "that argument holds for the large @xmath0 region . at low @xmath0",
    "the fluctuation time becomes approximately @xmath4 independent : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the proton mass and one assumes  @xcite @xmath16 .",
    "thus for the low@xmath0 region at hera , one expects also highly virtual photons to acquire some structure before interacting with the proton .",
    "thus we are back to the question of how to interpret the dis measurements .",
    "are we measuring the proton structure function @xmath17 or the photon structure function @xmath18 ? who is probing who ?",
    "it is clear that physics can not be frame dependent  @xcite .",
    "thus it must be that both descriptions are correct and reflect the fact that cross sections are lorenz invariant but time development is not  @xcite .",
    "this means that it should nt matter whether one interprets the cross section measurements as yielding the proton or the photon structure function . by extracting one of them from the cross section measurement",
    ", there should be a relation allowing to obtain the other .",
    "on the other hand we know that at least as far as a real photon is concerned , its structure function behaves very differently from that of the proton one . as an example one can mention the @xmath4 scaling violation which is positive in the photon case for all values of @xmath0 , while for the proton they change from positive to negative scaling violations as one moves to higher @xmath0 values  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to suggest a way of relating the proton and the photon structure function in the low@xmath0 region , where the interpretation of the results can be ambiguous . by extending the gribov factorization  @xcite from the real photon to the virtual photon case",
    "one can obtain @xmath19 and @xmath18 from the measured @xmath17 in the low@xmath0 region .",
    "gribov factorization is based on the assumption that at high energies the total cross section of two interacting particles is determined by the property of the universal pomeron trajectory .",
    "this implies relations between total cross section of various particles .",
    "gribov factorization can be used  @xcite to relate the total @xmath20 cross section , @xmath21 , with that of photoproduction , @xmath22 , and that of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , all at the same center of mass energy squared @xmath25 : @xmath26 this relation is approximately borne out  @xcite with the available measurements of @xmath21 .    in case one of the photons is virtual , and assuming that gribov factorization is applicable also for virtual photons , one can write : @xmath27    the interest in the low@xmath0 region stems from the fact that low @xmath0 for a given @xmath4 value means high center of mass energy @xmath28 , since they are related through : @xmath29 in this region one can connect the proton structure function @xmath17 with the total @xmath30 cross section : @xmath31 similarly one can relate the photon structure function @xmath19 to the total @xmath32 cross section : @xmath33 the approximate signs are well justified for the low@xmath0 region . using equation  ( [ eq : fac * ] ) one gets : @xmath34 this last equation connects the proton and the real photon structure function at low @xmath0 . by measuring one of them , the other",
    "can be determined through relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) .",
    "please note at this point that @xmath0 should be treated as a measure of the center of mass energy available in the interaction , as given in equation  ( [ eq : x - w2 ] ) .",
    "the next step is to extend relation  ( [ eq : fac * ] ) to the case where both photons are virtual , one with virtuality of @xmath4 and the other with @xmath35 .",
    "assuming gribov factorization to hold also for this case , one can write : @xmath36 just like above , we can replace some of the cross sections with structure functions to obtain : @xmath37 this can also be expressed as : @xmath38 once again we obtained at low @xmath0 a relation between the measured proton structure function and that of the virtual photon .",
    "thus equations  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : fac - f2qp ] ) suggest that indeed at low @xmath0 both interpretation of the dis cross sections as describing the structure of the proton or that of the photon are correct .",
    "donnachie and landshoff ( dl )  @xcite have shown that all data on hadron hadron cross sections can be expressed in the regge picture as a sum of two terms coming from contributions of the pomeron and the reggeon trajectories .",
    "the contribution of the pomeron term is proportional to @xmath40 where the pomeron intercept is expressed as @xmath41 . by fitting all available total cross section data",
    ", they obtained the value @xmath42 0.08 .",
    "the measurements at hera of the total photoproduction cross section  @xcite showed that this value of @xmath43 can explain also @xmath44 cross sections . assuming that the pomeron term dominates , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where both coefficients are such that the resulting cross section is in milibarns and @xmath28 is in gev . by using relation  ( [ eq : fac ] ) one obtains  @xcite : @xmath47 where again the cross section is expressed in milibarns .",
    "this expression thus indicates that the energy behaviour of the total @xmath20 cross sections is the same as any other hadron hadron or photoproduction cross section behaviour .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fac * ] ) can be used to get the relation : @xmath49 which predicts that the @xmath32 total cross sections behaves at large energies in the same way as the @xmath30 cross section .",
    "the hera data  @xcite can be well described by @xmath50  @xcite , and thus one expects also : @xmath51 since @xmath52 increases with @xmath4 from the value of 0.08 at @xmath53 0 to a value of about 0.3 at @xmath53 20 gev@xmath54 , we expect that also the @xmath32 total cross section will have a steeper @xmath28 behaviour as @xmath4 increases",
    ".      in the case where both photons are virtual the energy behaviour will depend on both @xmath4 and @xmath35 .",
    "using equation  ( [ eq : fac * * ] ) , one gets : @xmath57 since @xmath58 , this means that the @xmath59 cross section is expected to have a steeper @xmath28 dependence than the total @xmath30 one .",
    "we compare the gribov factorization relations to data from two experiments which performed a double tag measurement and obtained @xmath60 .",
    "one is the tpc collaboration  @xcite which tagged both photons with a virtuality of @xmath61 0.3 gev@xmath54 .",
    "the other is the pluto collaboration  @xcite which tagged one photon at @xmath62 5 gev@xmath54 and the other at @xmath63 0.35 gev@xmath54 .",
    "cross section as function of @xmath28 for the tpc data ( @xmath61 0.3 gev@xmath54 ) ( upper plot ) and for the pluto data ( @xmath62 5 gev@xmath54 , @xmath63 0.35 gev@xmath54 ) ( lower plot ) .",
    "the curves are the expectations from the gribov factorization relation . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : sggvirt ] presents the total cross section data as function of @xmath28 . in order to calculate the expectations coming from the gribov factorization relation  ( [ eq : fac * * ] ) we use the dl parameterization of the @xmath23 total cross section . for the @xmath64 cross section we use the allm  @xcite parameterization which gives a good description of all the measured data in the @xmath4 range between 0.32000 gev@xmath54 .",
    "the curves appearing in the figure are obtained using the above parameterizations .",
    "since the relations from the gribov factorization are expected to be valid in the low@xmath0 region , the value of @xmath28 at which it can be applied is @xmath4 dependent .",
    "if we call ` low@xmath0 ' as @xmath65 , we expect the factorization to work for @xmath66 5 gev for @xmath67 0.3 gev@xmath54 and @xmath68 22 gev for @xmath53 5 gev@xmath54 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the tpc data are in the range of validity of the gribov factorization and good agreement between the expectations and the data is obtained .",
    "the pluto data are at lower @xmath28 values , where one can still see a drop with energy toward the place where it would start rising again .",
    "the structure function of a real photon was measured in a @xmath4 range of 0.24390 gev@xmath54 .",
    "most measurements , except those in the low @xmath4 region , are in the relatively high@xmath0 region .",
    "the data are plotted in figure  [ fig : f2gg - data - fac ] as function of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath4 values .",
    "[ bb=15 88 534 732,width=,totalheight=12 cm ] f2gg-data-fac.ps    in general , the structure function values seem to be decreasing as @xmath0 gets smaller .",
    "there is a clear lack of data in the region @xmath69 0.1 .",
    "the lines in the figure are the result of using the gribov factorization relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 ] ) .",
    "instead of using the available data on @xmath17 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 and extrapolate / interpolate the values to the kinematic region where the @xmath20 data is measured , we used the dl parameterization for the @xmath44 and @xmath70 cross sections and the allm parameterization for @xmath17 . with",
    "the dl parameterization one obtains a simple relation : @xmath71 in the low @xmath4 region , where low@xmath0 data are available for the photon structure function , the lines agree with the data . at higher @xmath4 regions , the predictions at high @xmath0",
    "fall below the data as expected since in the large@xmath0 region factorization is not expected to hold . in the low@xmath0 region ,",
    "the shape of @xmath19 should follow exactly that of @xmath17 according to equation  ( [ eq : f2g - f2p ] ) .",
    "the parameterization of the photon parton distributions given in  @xcite has this feature in the low@xmath0 region",
    ". it would be most desirable to get data on the photon structure function in the low@xmath0 region to confirm this relation .",
    "there exist no measurement of @xmath18 in the low@xmath0 region .",
    "we will use relation  ( [ eq : fac - f2 * ] ) to calculate the predictions of the gribov factorization for some specific @xmath4 and @xmath35 values , shown in figure  [ fig : f2gvirt ] .",
    "[ bb=15 88 534 732,width=,totalheight=10 cm ] f2gvirt.ps    one sees a steep rise of the structure function with decreasing @xmath0 which is steeper than that observed for the proton structure function .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even for a virtual photon of @xmath35 = 10 gev@xmath54 , its structure function has a relatively high value at low enough @xmath0 provided the ` probing ' photon is highly virtual compared to the ` probed ' photon .",
    "gribov factorization has been applied for two cases where data exist and in the region of its expected validity the results are consistent with the data .",
    "one can use the measurements of @xmath17 at low @xmath0 in order to predict @xmath19 in that @xmath0 region .",
    "predictions have been also given for the structure function of virtual photons for some values of @xmath35 .",
    "the title of the paper indicated a problem of how to interpret at low @xmath0 the results of the dis experiments as to who is being probed by who . since in dis",
    "one measures cross sections , in principle this question should not matter since the result can not be frame dependent .",
    "this however means that by interpreting the result as coming from the structure of the proton , one should be able to learn about the structure of the photon .",
    "we showed here that if one can assume gribov factorization to hold also for the case of a virtual photon , one can obtain a simple relation between the proton and the photon structure function .",
    "thus by measuring one of them , the other is determined through the factorization relation .",
    "the simple relation between the photon and proton structure function obtained here relies on the extension of gribov factorization to the case of a virtual photon .",
    "this implies a factorizable pomeron also in dis processes , which so far seems to be borne out experimentally at hera  @xcite .",
    "experimental verification of the relations between the photon and proton structure functions given above would be another support for the factorizable pomeron in dis .",
    "however it should be noted that factorization breaking of the pomeron in dis would mean that the relations between the proton and photon structure function are not as simple as those obtained in this paper .",
    "we can conclude that at large @xmath0 the photon is probing the proton . at low @xmath0",
    "they seem to talk to each other : probing one teaches us about the other .",
