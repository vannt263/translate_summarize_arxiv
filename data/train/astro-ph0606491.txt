    "we began a programme of regular infrared ( 15 ) spectroscopic monitoring of v838  mon soon after the 2002 eruption was reported by @xcite ; the results are described in @xcite .",
    "all of the data reported here cover the first overtone co bands ( bandhead at 2.29 ) and the a  x ( 20 ) alo bands at 1.67 . in this contribution",
    "we discuss our attempts to model the complex evolution of these bands , as revealed by our low resolution obervations of co and alo .",
    "details of the infrared data we obtained at high resolution , and what the data tell us about the complex velocity systems in the environment of v838  mon , is discussed by geballe elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "we also describe here the results of an observation at 850  with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "we consider the star to be at the centre of one or two spherically symmetric , expanding shell(s ) .",
    "as noted by geballe ( this volume ) it is more likely that three , or even four , shells are present ; however at the low resolution of the spectra one or two shells gives a good representation of the data .",
    "we have taken the first overtone co linelist ( in excess of 40000 lines ) from @xcite and alo data from various sources ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we fit the models to the data using an amoeba algorithm , based on downhill simplex @xcite .",
    "we optimized for the excitation temperature and column of co , and similarly for alo , and for the temperature of the background ( blackbody ) continuum . for the present",
    "we assume lte .",
    "we found that the temperature of the background varied between @xmath2  k and @xmath3  k. initially we also optimized for the @xmath4c/@xmath5c ratio but this was not well constrained , with a lower limit of 16 ; this is consistent with the apparent absence of @xmath5co bands described by geballe ( this volume ) .",
    "optimization ( particularly for alo ) is not helped by the presence of many other species , particularly h@xmath6o , which are not included in our analysis at this stage .",
    "examples of model spectra around the first overtone co bands are shown in fig .",
    "the model spectra qualitatively cover the range of first overtone co profiles observed in v838  mon by our programme and by @xcite . at 2800",
    "k the co spectra are qualitatively similar to those seen in late giants . at low enough co excitation temperature ( @xmath7 ) the optical depth in the co lines",
    "is @xmath8 constant across the band and the bands lose their characteristic asymmetric shape . at @xmath9",
    "k the model bands resemble data obtained in our programme , those at 1800  k resemble data reported by @xcite . at high excitation temperatures",
    "the co begins to appear in emission .",
    "in particular the 1800  k model is strikingly similar to the co profiles for 2002 october and , while the models with @xmath10  k produce emission , the profiles are not flat as they are in the 2002 march data .",
    "the fits to the first overtone co bands in v838  mon are shown in fig .",
    "[ co1 ] ; the fits to the alo bands are shown in fig .  [ alo ] .",
    "we find that the excitation temperature and column of co decline with time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ co2 ] , presumably the result of the detachment , followed by cooling and dispersal , of material ejected in the 2002 event .",
    "the run of co excitation temperature and column is broadly in line with that found by @xcite ; furthermore the decline in the excitation temperature , for both co and alo , is consistent with that found by @xcite for h@xmath6o .",
    "we note that there is clear evidence at the band head for an additional , hotter component in the later data ; this may be the photosphere reappearing through the ejected material .    while our simple model provides a good qualitative account of the behaviour of the co and alo we consider that a more complete description will likely require more shells than we have considered here ( cf .",
    "geballe , this volume ) and non - lte treatment .",
    "there are benefits in observing the infrared equivalent of light echoes , for example the fact that detailed knowledge of the grain scattering phase function is not required for interpretation . in this case",
    "we see the ` infrared echo ' , commonly observed ( as indeed are light echoes ) when supernovae erupt @xcite . in the infrared case",
    "we see the results of grain heating and re - radiation as the paraboloid of constant light travel time ( see sugerman , this volume ) passes through the dust .",
    "the thermal inertia of grains is such that they react essentially instantaneously to changes in the ambient radiation field .",
    "@xcite has presented spitzer mips observation of the v838  mon infrared echo ; see also ashok ( this volume ) .",
    "they find that the emission at 24 , 70 and 160  is spatially correlated with the hst light echo ; they also find emission associated with the dust located close to the star itself .",
    "they estimate that the mass of dust in the light echo material is @xmath8  a few solar masses , and they conclude that a significant fraction of the emitting dust is likely interstellar in origin .",
    "we have used the sub - millimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the jcmt to make a @xmath11 850  jiggle map of the light echo over the period 2003 october  2004 january ( most of the observations being in 2004 january ) , when the radius of the light echo was @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we get a @xmath13 upper limit of 160mjy from the star itself ; the sed for late 2003 is shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] .",
    "we find a @xmath13 upper limit at 850  of @xmath14  jy  sr@xmath15 from the region containing the light echo material . in order to interpret this result",
    "we have estimated the likely intensity of the 850   emission from the light echo dust by making an analytic fit to the time - dependence of the bolometric luminosity @xmath16 and @xmath17 from @xcite and integrating through a plane thin dusty inclined slab @xcite .",
    "we take optical constants for silicates from @xcite .",
    "we find an upper limit on the dust column in the echo material @xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "this column gives an upper limit of @xmath18m@xmath19 , within @xmath20 , for 0.1  silicate grains and for 59  kpc distance ; this is clearly significantly below the mass deduced by @xcite .",
    "we have fitted a spherically symmetric , expanding shell of co and alo to the near - infrared spectra of v838  mon .",
    "we find a declining column of co and alo , and a declining @xmath21 for both species .",
    "however there is an additional hot co component from 2005 jan .",
    "we find an upper limit of @xmath0  @xmath1 , and corresponding upper mass limit of @xmath22  m@xmath23 , for the dust in light echo material ; this is significantly lower than that implied by the spitzer observations .",
