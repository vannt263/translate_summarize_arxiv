    "pn g035.5 - 00.4 and iras 18551 + 0159 were discovered and identified as possible pne by @xcite .",
    "their angular sizes are about @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , based on infrared and radio observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . iras 18551 + 0159",
    "is extremely red and has no optical counterpart .",
    "this implies iras 18551 + 0159 just left from the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) recently ( @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite detected radio recombination lines ( rrls ) at a position of l=@xmath7 b=@xmath8 , close to pn g035.5 - 00.4 .",
    "they identified this rrls source as a likely region g35.6 - 0.5 .",
    "@xcite questioned the existence of the region g35.6 - 0.5 because there is no 100 @xmath9 m emission from it and the rrls may come from the nearby pn g035.5 - 00.4 .",
    "snr g35.6 - 0.4 has the most tortuous discovery history .",
    "it had first been identified as an snr due to its deep spectral index derived by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested that g35.6 - 0.4 is an snr .",
    "however , there existed opposing claims , e.g. this source has a flat spectral index @xcite ; rrls is detected within the source .",
    "however , @xcite reanalyzed previous measurements and derived a deep spectral index to g35.6 - 0.4 .",
    "moreover , the iras 100 @xmath9 m image showed in his figure 3 is a supporting evidence that g35.6 - 0.4 is an snr .",
    "@xcite suggested a kinematic distance of 12 kpc for snr g35.6 - 0.4 , which consists with the dispersion measure ( dm ) distance of @xmath1013 kpc to psr j1857 + 0212 .",
    "therefore , they thought that the snr g35.6 - 0.4/psr j1857 + 0212 association was real .",
    "although the recent - estimated dm distance to psr j1857 + 0212 has been changed to 7.98 kpc @xcite , but the snr changed its distance too , i.e. 10.5 kpc ( assuming that snr g35.6 - 0.4 is at the same distance as the distance - known region g35.5 - 0.0 , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the snr g35.6 - 0.4/psr j1857 + 0212 association seems still possible according to recent studies .",
    "@xcite noticed that the weak gamma ray source hess j1858 + 020 is located at the southern border of snr g35.6 - 0.4 ( see figure 1 of their paper ) .",
    "they analyzed the @xmath11 line of two molecular clouds ( mcs ) towards the southern border of g35.6 - 0.4 , and suggested the association between the snr g35.6 - 0.4 and the @xmath1055 km s@xmath2 mc as the counterpart of hess j1858 + 020 .",
    "@xcite pointed out if this association is real , i.e. , the hess j1858 + 020 is connected with cosmic - ray protons accelerated by snr g35.6 - 0.4 , it would be difficult not to produce detectable gev emission at the same location .",
    "these results are based on a distance of 10.5 kpc to both snr g35.6 - 0.4 and the co cloud and the derived molecular mass in the environment .",

    "this minimizes the possibility of obtaining a false absorption spectrum . in addition",

    "compared with absorption spectra of three other regions which show absorption features from 30 km s@xmath2 to 50 km s@xmath2 , a distance of 2.4@xmath00.5 kpc is rational to g35.14 - 0.76 ( i.e. the near side distance of the 35 km s@xmath2 absorption feature ) .",
    "@xcite s calculation was based on a distance to the snr / mc complex of 10.5 kpc , and a molecular mass of several thousand solar masses . accepting",
    "the new distance estimate for the remnant , of 3.6@xmath00.4 kpc , suggests much less mass is available for cosmic - ray interactions , of the order of 600 @xmath38 . assuming these parameters , we have reconsidered the model put forward by @xcite and the results are as follows . for details regarding the numerical model itself",
    "we refer the reader to the works by @xcite , and @xcite    the physical size of the snr shell and the projected separation to the mc are also resized due to the revised distance to the snr / mc complex , as seen above .",
    "this means that the accelerated particles diffuse to much shorter distances than what was considered before .",
    "the maximum of the particle flux , for a given energy @xmath39 at a given time @xmath40 , is reached at the distance @xmath41 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is equal to a projected distance of @xmath42 pc for energies of @xmath43 tev and a diffusion coefficient of @xmath44 , with @xmath45 @xmath46 s@xmath47and @xmath48=0.5 .",
    "the bulk of the particles with lower energies than 5 tev , then , still have not reached the target mass .",
    "this is exact for an impulsive source , when the age of the source is much longer than the time over which the particles are injected .    due to smaller age ,",
    "the source is probably better approximated as a continuous injection point , as the short age is comparable to the time of release of the particles .",
    "the injection luminosity is such that the total energy input in the lifetime of the snr is @xmath49 erg , hence equal to @xmath50 erg s@xmath47 .",
    "we choose the slope of the injection spectrum to match the one in @xcite , with @xmath51 .",
    "the only parameters that are left free for a fit are then the actual separation of the accelerator ( that would probably not exceed the projected separation by more than a factor of few ) from the target and the actual mass of the target that interacts with the cosmic - ray population .",
    "note that in @xcite , distances from the injection point in the shell were quoted .",
    "here we simply refer to distances from the center of the snr .",
    "figure [ fig : fittingmodels ] shows the prediction from models having the parameters specified in table [ tbl : param_models ] .",
    "the cosmic - ray sea contribution is the dominant one at the lowest energies ( in the _ fermi_-lat regime ) .",
    "but , due to the small mass of the target cloud , the contribution to the flux given by the emission related to the cosmic - ray sea amounts to a very low flux , below the range of fluxes shown in the figures and is then invisible in there .",
    "the results of figure [ fig : fittingmodels ] and table [ tbl : param_models ] show that the new distance and mc estimation does not rule out the possibility of a connection between g35.6 - 0.4 and hess j1858 + 020 . actually , it is currently more favorable than in the case of a 10.5 kpc - distance , since the low values of diffusion coefficient required before are no longer needed to maintain the gev luminosity below observational sensitivity .",
    "we note , however , that for a diffusion coefficient of the order of the galactic average one , i.e. @xmath52 @xmath46 s@xmath47 , we need a large separation between the accelerator and the target , with a mass of the latter that largely exceeds the estimates given here by one order of magnitude . therefore we still expect a suppressed diffusion coefficient in the environment in case of a physical association .",
    "we also note that the snr diameter is of the order of 15 pc , so assuming 10 pc radius from the injection point is a bare minimum for a realistic model , and slightly higher separations would be preferred .",
