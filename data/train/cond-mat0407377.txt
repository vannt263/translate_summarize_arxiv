    "for a long time the standard model of _ non - interacting _ two - level - systems ( _ tls _ )",
    "@xcite has served as a good background for understanding experimental data in glasses at low temperatures @xmath0 .",
    "the further investigations revealed that below @xmath1 almost all measurements in dielectric glasses dealing with their relaxation properties @xcite can not be treated ignoring the _ tls _ interaction .",
    "for this reason one can suppose that that below @xmath1 _ tls _ manifest the collective behavior induced by the interaction between them .",
    "it is well established that in amorphous solids _ tls _ are coupled with phonons . in dielectric glasses at @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the debye temperature ) coupling with acoustic phonons plays a main role .",
    "the virtual exchange of _ tls _ by acoustic phonons results in the indirect interaction between _ tls _ , which decays with the distance @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , this interaction gives rise to the flip - flop transitions between two _ tls _ ( see fig .",
    "the transition amplitudes also decay with the distance as @xmath5 @xcite . in a number of dielectric glasses , _ tls _ possess their own dipole moment . in this case",
    "the electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction can become the dominating interaction between _ tls_.@xcite this interaction also decreases with the distance as @xmath5 .",
    "it was experimentally discovered by arnold and hunklinger @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the @xmath6 interaction contributes to the spectral diffusion of the _ tls _ energy .",
    "this spectral diffusion involves the dynamic fluctuation of the _ tls _ energy due to its interaction with neighboring _ tls _ , making transitions between their levels @xcite .",
    "along with the interaction significance for the acoustic @xcite and optical @xcite hole burning experiments , it also affects the decay of coherent echoes @xcite . also the interaction between _",
    "tls _ has been revealed in the non - equilibrium dielectric measurements @xcite , giving rise to the reduction of the spectral density near zero energy .",
    "this is interpreted as the dipole gap formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been found that the transition from coherent to incoherent tunneling takes place if the typical interaction energy exceeds tunneling splitting @xcite .",
    "recently discovered anomalous low - temperature behavior of amorphous solids in the external magentic field @xcite can also be associated with the _ tls _ interaction .",
    "the relaxation in a disordered system can be due to delocalized excitations .",
    "the single particle energy delocalization is not efficient for the ensemble of interacting _ tls _ because the static energy disordering is very strong there .",
    "therefore , the anderson localization @xcite of all excitations takes place .",
    "in other words , the localization in the disordered _ tls _ system is due to a large energy level mismatch for a typical pair of _ tls _ ( fig .",
    "1a ) compared with the flip - flop transition amplitude for this pair .",
    "suppose that a _ tls _",
    "excitation energy can experience large time - dependent fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can reduce the energy mismatch value , stimulating level crossing and supporting flip - flop transitions ( see the resonant pair in fig .",
    "such fluctuations can be induced by either the external alternating ( measuring ) field or they can be due to the spectral diffusion , caused by transitions of neighboring _",
    "tls_. thus , such fluctuations can promote the delocalization in the system . in the absence of the external field",
    "this delocalization can be treated as a self - consistent process in which the spectral diffusion induces _ tls _ transitions . in its turn ,",
    "_ tls _ transitions cause the spectral diffusion due to _ tls _ interaction .",
    "this paper is a comprehensive presentation of our results concerning the effect of @xmath5 interaction on the dynamic properties of amorphous solids .",
    "it is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we address the single particle localization problem for zero temperature and zero external alternating field . in sect .",
    "3 the effect of an external alternating field on the single particle localization is studied .",
    "we demonstrate that the field having a sufficiently large amplitude and a small frequency can break the anderson localization . in sect .",
    "4 we study the finite temperature many - body delocalization of a _ tls _ energy within the _ tls _ ensemble induced by the self- consistent dynamics of resonant pairs ( see fig .",
