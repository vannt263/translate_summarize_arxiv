    "using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) in a small 216 atom model for amorphous silicon we have recently demonstrated@xcite that a presence of spherical void type defect in a - si network results in localized low energy excitations . to gain a better understanding of the behavior of these vibrational modes and verify our previous results we perform extensive computer md simulations for large 4096 atom model for a - si and models with voids constructed from it .",
    "thanks to the large size of the supercell for this model ( approximately 43   ) we are able to track the `` void size dependent properties '' of the system by building a set of models with bigger and bigger voids , but of course at the expense of losing all the merits of _ ab initio _ approach , which makes the calculations way too slow for the models containing thousands of atoms .",
    "in our current investigation we employ an environment - dependent interatomic potential ( edip ) for amorphous silicon developed by bazant and kaxiras@xcite which enables us to dramatically improve the speed of calculations in comparison to _ ab initio _ technique . due to the fact that this potential is ( i ) relatively new and ( ii ) has been fitted to simulate only the bulk properties of amorphous silicon@xcite ( and not surfaces",
    " like we get when making a void in our model ) it is also interesting to test it s accuracy for calculations of vibrational properties of models for pure a - si and a - si with voids , especially on small ones  to verify that edip can reproduce ( at least , qualitatively ) the features we see with _ ab initio _ method .    in sec .",
    "ii of this paper we describe the construction routine for the models we study and the calculation scheme for analyzing their vibrational properties . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the properties of vibrational excitations obtained for 216 atom ( for verification purposes ) and 4096 atom models and their derivatives with voids , including their spatial localization and dependence on the size of the void .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "iv by giving a summary of our results on computer simulation of low - energy excitations in amorphous silicon .",
    "the model construction routine we make use of closely resembles the one that is described in our previous paper@xcite with a single major difference : in it s current state edip can work only with one atom type  silicon , which makes it impossible to simulate hydrogenated a - si .    in everything else our model constructing routine works as follows : we employ 4096 atom model for pure a - si made by djordjevic , thorpe and wooten@xcite ( refered to as dtw in what follows ) with the help of wooten , winer and weaire bond switching algorithm@xcite as a `` base '' for building a family of models with voids .",
    "the model is relaxed with our md code with edip until the forces on every atom in the system are smaller than @xmath0  ev /  .",
    "then an arbitrary atom@xcite is chosen and all the atoms ( including the chosen one ) within certain radius from it are removed to make a void . after this procedure the model with a void is relaxed once again to obtain it s equilibrium configuration , so that the harmonic approximation for the total energy of the system is appropriate .",
    "finally we compute the dynamical matrix of the system by displacing every atom in the cell by @xmath1     in three orthogonal directions and calculating the originating edip forces on all the atoms in the system . due to the fact that dynamical matrix for a system containing thousands of atoms is huge we have to extensively exploit it s sparse nature discarding terms smaller than , which in our opinion is a good compromise between the accuracy of the calculation and compactness of the output .",
    "once the sparse dynamical matrix for the system is obtained we use a separate computer program to calculate it s eigenvalues and eigenvectors together with their inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) . again , for the sake of compactness , only low - energy ( less than ) eigenvectors with significantly high iprs  and this is the point of our main interest  are written out .",
    "we make use of gaussian broadened representation for , where are the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix to plot the graphs for vibrational density of states ( vdos ) for our system .",
    "the width of broadening is for the `` full scale '' graphs and for the close - ups of the low - energy region .",
    "we finish our investigation by creating color or gray scale vibrational activity maps for the `` low - energy , high ipr '' modes in exactly the same way that has been already described in sec .",
    "ii of ref .  1 .",
    "we begin this section with presenting some testing results for small 216 atom dtw model and 211 atom model with a void constructed from it by removing a single atom from the network together with it s four nearest neighbors . the results of our vdos and ipr calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ si216 ] .",
    "it s easy to notice that the model with void has a localized state in the low - energy gap which complies with our previous findings@xcite ( we neglect all of the hydrogen motion in our a - si : h model in ref .  1 while making this comparison because hydrogen atoms do not `` participate '' in vibrational excitations of such low energy ) .",
    "it also means that despite the fact that edip , comparing to the _ ab initio _ calculation , gives us different low - energy gap edge , it is capable of reproducing the localized low - energy excitations .",
    "a `` vibrational activity '' colormap for the excitation we see in 211 atom model with void ( not shown here ) also appeares to be in good agreement with our previous results .",
    "-1 cm    -1 cm    the graph with a comparison of vdos calculated for 216 dtw model with _ ab initio _ and edip is presented in fig .",
    "[ vdos216 ] .",
    "the experimental results are taken from kamitakahara _",
    "et al.@xcite _ in our opinion this figure demonstrates that , at least for simulations of _ vibrational _ properties of a - si , edip exhibits the same behavior as the well known stillinger - weber potential@xcite .",
    "-1.5 cm    -1.5 cm    now we are going to discuss the large 4096 atom dtw model and the family of models with voids based on it .",
    "three models with voids of different size have been built : 4091 atom model with a `` small bubble '' ( analogous to 211 atom model derived from 216 )  a void of approximately 5    in diameter , 4069 atom `` medium bubble '' model with 10    void and 4008 atom `` big bubble '' model with 15    void .",
    "the low - energy region vdos and ipr close - ups for all the four models are shown in fig .",
    "[ big_four ] .",
    "we do not present `` full scale '' vdos graphs here because ( i ) in that scale they all look indistinguishable from each other and ( ii ) generally , vdos constructed for 4096 atom model does nt provide much more information than the one of 216 atom model , shown in fig .  [ si216 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ big_four ] one can see that the situation with the large models is more complicated than in the case of the family of 216 atom models .",
    "first of all , it turns out that `` pure '' 4096 atom model has two localized low - energy modes@xcite that are most probably associated with strained regions of silicon network .",
    "consequently , we receive modes of two major types in our void models : those associated directly with voids and modes produced by mixing of the former ones with localized excitations of the `` pure '' model .",
    "the modes , associated with voids , exhibit the same kind of localization properties that we have reported earlier@xcite , localizing to the side of the void , while the modes , produced by mixing , either localize on approximately the same strained regions of the cell as in `` pure '' model ( although they are not exact copies of the modes observed in `` pure '' model , which we attribute to the fact that quenching of the model with void results in different system geometry even in the regions away from the void ) or form strings between the strained regions and the void .    curiously enough our data shows that for different models with voids modes of different types dominate in the low - energy region ! in the `` small bubble '' model a mode with the highest ipr at is of `` void '' type , but the succeeding three modes with high ipr at 14.43 , 18.25 and are of strongly pronounced `` mixed '' type . in the `` medium bubble '' model , to the contrary , all three low - energy localized modes at 5.89 , 6.12 and are of `` mixed '' type .",
    "the mode with strong `` void '' type behavior is also present but it is shifted to . finally in the `` big bubble '' model modes at 2.34 and are of `` void '' type and all the others , including a strongly localized mode at , exhibit `` mixed '' type behavior .    for the sake of compactness we havent included any of the colormaps for the 4096 atom family of models in this paper .",
    "however a colormap set for particularly interesting vibrational excitations in these models is available for internet download@xcite .",
    "we have studied low - energy vibrational excitations in 216 and 4096 atom dtw models for amorphous silicon and the families of models with voids based on them , employing the new bazant - kaxiras environment - dependent interatomic potential .",
    "good qualitative agreement between the data obtained for 216 dtw model and it s derivative with a void and the results of our previous _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for the same model leads us to believe that edip can be used for probing localized low - energy modes in a - si models .",
    "our investigation of vibrational properties of 4096 atom model and it s void derivatives shows that the latter posses a complex spectrum of localized low - energy excitations that we can roughly divide into two groups  `` void '' and `` mixed '' type modes  according to their localization patterns .",
    "we have also found out that there is no simple dependence between the size of the void and the energy of it s `` void '' type mode .",
    "it seems that not only the size of the void but also the positions of the void and strained regions of the network with respect to each other and peculiarities of the network geometry play a very important role in understanding why the modes of a certain localization nature ( i.e. `` void '' type or `` mixed '' type ) dominate at certain energy intervals .",
