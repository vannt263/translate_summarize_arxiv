    "the obliquity is simultaneously derived from the retrieval of the surface map @xcite .",
    "the generality of obliquity retrieval from photometric variation was recently studied by @xcite .",
    "they explained how the obliquity affected the shape and location of the kernel of the scattered light .",
    "in essence , these methods use information on the amplitude modulation to extract spin information .",
    "hence , the albedo map of the planet contributes nuisance parameters to the global light curve fit . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the frequency domain of the photometric variability , rather than the amplitude modulation .",
    "we utilize the frequency modulation as an estimator of the obliquity , which is less sensitive to the albedo distribution of the planet .    regarding photometric variability in the frequency domain , @xcite presented a pioneering work applying the autocorrelation function to the simulated photometric variation .",
    "they showed that the photometric variation of the simulated earth contains sufficient information to measure the spin rotation period despite variable weather patterns . studied the fourier coefficient of the photometric variation for various surface types of earth - like planets and several configurations ( i.e. obliquity and inclination )",

    ", we concentrate on the geometric effect of the frequency modulation and restrict the scope of targets to the light scattered by the static planetary surface .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we construct a simple model of the frequency modulation due to geometric effects . in section 3 ,",
    "we simulate photometric variability assuming the lambert model of static albedo distribution .",
    "we extract the instantaneous frequency from the pseudo - wigner distribution of the simulated light curve .",

    "let us first consider the prograde rotation of an aligned planet with a static surface distribution .",
    "the spin rotation frequency is defined by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the sidereal day of the planet ( the spin rotation period ) .",
    "the sidereal day is the period required for the planet to make one rotation about the inertial reference frame of the stellar system .",
    "the period of the photometric variation is identical to the so - called synodic day , which is defined as the period that it takes to rotate once around the central star .",
    "the apparent diurnal periodicity derived from the photometric variability is then @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the orbital frequency and @xmath4 is the orbital period . for the retrograde rotation ( the obliquity of @xmath5 ) , we obtain @xmath6 .",
    "we are then faced with the question of how the obliquity changes the apparent diurnal periodicity .",
    "figure [ fig : obliquity_type ] illustrates how the obliquity and orbital inclination induce frequency modulation .",
    "panel ( a ) displays prograde , retrograde , and pole - on planets in a face - on orbit . the illuminated area painted in white moves in the direction of the red arrow .",
    "because the rotation axis of the illuminated area is aligned with the spin axis , the photometric frequency of the prograde and retrograde planets is stationarily shifted as @xmath7 . for the case of pole - on planets , the rotation axis of the illuminated area",
    "is not aligned with the spin axis . in panel",
    "( b ) , the representative point ( the weighted center ) of the illuminated area is indicated by a filled cross .",
    "when the latitude of the weighted center moves from the center ( i ) to the left ( ii ) , the apparent rotation speeds up .",
    "the shift of the weighted center to the right decelerates the apparent rotation ( iii ) .",
    "thus , the motion of the illuminated area modulates the frequency of the apparent rotation .",
    "the motion of the illuminated area due to orbital inclination also induces frequency modulation according to the same principle .",
    "as shown in panel ( c ) , the shift of the illuminated area around the inferior conjunction negatively modulates the apparent rotation rate . in general , frequency modulation due to orbital inclination is significant near the inferior conjunction .",
    "we call these types of frequency modulation the geometric frequency modulation .     ]",
    "the apparent periodicity depends on both the spin vector and the albedo distribution .",
    "the integrated light from the lambert surface is expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the albedo distribution on the planetary surface of ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the illuminated and visible area , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the weight functions of the visible and illuminated areas , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the unit vectors of @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( p = the planet center , s = the stellar center , and o = the observer ) and , the normal vector of the surface .",
    "it is useful to exclude the influence of the albedo distribution from the model . assuming that variability can be mainly attributed to the surface at the maximum weighted longitude , we construct a model of photometric periodicity by computing the phase shift of the maximum weighted longitude , @xmath18 .",

    "we replaced the fft in the original code by the non - uniform fft algorithm @xcite . in appendix c",
    ", we describe the implementation of the non - uniform fft into the pseudo - wigner distribution and the comparison of the systems with the non - uniform fft and the fft .",
    "we also test our code for known signals with a given instantaneous frequency in appendices c and d. in practice , the selection of the window width of @xmath79 , @xmath90 , is critical for noisy data .",

    "the dashed line indicates the instantaneous frequency from the maximum weighted longitude approximation .",
    "the prediction curve from the maximum weighted longitude approximation reproduces the general characteristics of the instantaneous frequency of the simulations .",
    "however , there remains some difference between the black and red lines . because the test given in appendix c does not exhibit such a difference ( figure [ fig : width ] ) , this difference originates from the influence of the albedo distribution we ignore in the maximum weighted longitude approximation .",
    "we investigate another dozen parameter sets for @xmath95 .",
    "we confirmed that we can extract the instantaneous frequency for the @xmath96 100 % noise in most cases but , in some configurations , we need to decrease the noise level to @xmath97% to extract the instantaneous frequency .",
    "we also found that similar cases sometimes happen when randomly rotating the albedo distribution for the fiducial parameter set .",
    "we found that these noise - sensitive cases can be attributed to particular configurations which prevent sufficient amplitude of the photometric variation depending on the albedo distribution and the geometric parameters .",
    "since optimizing the noise is beyond the scope of our paper , we do not try to improve this further to detect the instantaneous frequency for these noise - sensitive cases .",
    "instead , we point out that numerous techniques in the high - noise environment have been proposed ( see * ? ? ?",

    "these techniques may potentially improve the detectability of the noise - sensitive configurations .",
    "figure [ fig : modfacsim ] displays the modulation factor of the simulated light curve derived from the pseudo - wigner distribution .",
    "we used the light curves with no noise , and adopted the pseudo - wigner distribution with a window width of @xmath94 to suppress the bias ( see appendix d ) .",
    "compared with figure [ fig : modfac ] , we find that the maximum weighted longitude approximation provides close agreement with the simulated modulation factor despite the fact that we ignore the dependence of the albedo distribution of the frequency modulation .",
    "thus , the frequency modulation contains sufficient information on the obliquity .",
    "for the highly inclined case @xmath98 , the intensity of the light curve significantly decreases near the inferior conjunction , and the gradient of the light curve also increases .",
    "these disadvantages near the inferior conjunction prevent accurate measurements of the frequency modulation due to the orbital inclination .",
    "even for @xmath99 ( the right panel in figure [ fig : modfacsim ] ) , one can see the disturbance of the extracted instantaneous frequency near the inferior conjunction @xmath100 . however , the difficulty for highly inclined planets is less problematic for our purpose because the direct imaging at the inferior conjunction for highly inclined planets is challenging in the first place .    to use the instantaneous frequency as an obliquity estimator , we fit the extracted instantaneous frequency by the maximum weighted longitude model .",
    "we generate 1000 realizations of the light curves with the noise for each parameter set and extract the instantaneous frequencies with the pseudo - wigner distribution ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we fit them by the maximum weighted longitude approximation using the levenberg - marquardt algorithm ( mpfit * ? ? ?",
    "we regard @xmath4 and @xmath101 as known parameters because the monitoring observation of the direct imaging provides them .",

    "the estimated planetary obliquity and the estimated phase are in good agreement with the input values for the cases a and b , although there are slight shifts of the center from the input . for case",
    "c , the bias is much larger than the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this bias is due to the lack of the albedo information in the maximum weighted longitude approximation .",
    "although the maximum weighted longitude approximation ( figure [ fig : modfac ] ) roughly reproduces the simulated modulation factor ( figure [ fig : modfacsim ] ) , the peak positions for a given @xmath19 between figures [ fig : modfac ] and [ fig : modfacsim ] often differs by several tens of degrees in @xmath30 .",
    "this difference also impacts the uncertainty of the obliquity . considering these facts ,",
    "the confidence region of the fitting with the maximum weighted longitude approximation is typically @xmath106 and @xmath107 , as shown by the yellow cross . to further reduce the bias ,",

    "thus , the frequency modulation due to the light - travel time effect is two orders of magnitude smaller than the geometric effect with @xmath117 au and a similar spin rotation rate to that of earth .",
    "because the thermal light also has the light - travel time effect , the light - travel time effect becomes important for thermal emission from a long - period planet with @xmath120 au , instead of the scattered light .",

    "the possibility of the detection of planetary wind is an interesting topic in itself , and the model of geometric frequency modulation should still be critical to extract the modulation of the planetary winds . to investigate the effect of the global planetary wind , detailed simulations of radiative transfer with a sufficiently fine time resolution are required .",
    "we postpone the impact of the dynamic planetary surface to a forthcoming paper using a global climate model and satellite data ( kawahara and kodama in preparation ) .",
    "application of our results to gas giants requires that we consider differential rotation .",

    "therefore , the am - based method suffers from a severe albedo - radius degeneracy .",
    "our method does not require that we solve the albedo map of the planet .",
    "the frequency modulation technique sidesteps this problem .",
    "however , our method requires that the albedo map be static , whereas the am - based method can in principle work for time - variable maps @xcite . @xcite and @xcite showed that the spin - orbit tomography may constrain the obliquity for the simulated earth with cloud variability . similarly , further simulations including the cloud variability are required to validate the frequency modulation technique for earth - like planets .",
    "the original spin - orbit tomography does not distinguish prograde rotation from retrograde one ( i.e. @xmath19 from @xmath126 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the longitudinal location of the kernel over an orbit might differentiate between the prograde and retrograde rotation .",
    "frequency modulation is very sensitive to the difference between the prograde and retrograde rotation , even for a face - on orbit , as mentioned at the end of section 2 .",
    "another advantage of using the frequency domain is that information on the normalization is not required . as is apparent from the procedure for the amplitude detrending , long - term stability over a year",
    "is not significant .",
    "moreover , the dependence of the geometric parameters on the instantaneous frequency is intuitively comprehensible .",
    "regarding the statistical noise , we showed that the pseudo - wigner distribution retrieved the instantaneous frequency of the data with the 100% noise compared to the standard deviation of the signal ( for 2-hr ) .",
    "because the typical amplitude of the variation of earth is @xmath127 % , it corresponds to s / n @xmath96 10 for a 2 hr exposure .",
    "@xcite assume the s / n=20 for a 4.8 hr exposure for the spin - orbit tomography , corresponding to the photon limit of a 5 m telescope for a 10 pc earth .",
    "our considered s / n is comparable to theirs .",
    "the full inversion by the spin - orbit tomography requires a precise measurement of the spin rotation period .",
    "for instance , one can recognize the frequency modulation of the simulated light curves in the diurnal and orbital phase plane in figure 6 of @xcite , which were used for the retrieval of the surface map and obliquity .",
