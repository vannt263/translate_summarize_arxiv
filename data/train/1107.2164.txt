    "structural multi - factor _ economic capital _ ( ec ) models derived from the creditmetrics framework @xcite have become the most widely adopted tools for risk quantification in credit portfolios .",
    "an outcome of these models , a portfolio ec and its allocation down to individual facilities , is used by financial institutions for any or all of the following : internal capital adequacy assessment , external reporting , risk - based pricing , performance management , acquisition / divestiture analyses , stress - testing and scenario analysis , etc . while in most cases monte carlo simulations are used due to limited analytical tractability of the multi - factor models , the recently reported advanced analytical techniques @xcite may be viewed as an alternative .    unfortunately , neither the industry standard simulation - based approach nor the existing analytical techniques can fully address the needs of the financial institutions .",
    "in particular , the risk - based real - time pricing remains the ultimate challenge : none of the existing models is capable of providing sufficiently accurate , stable and time - efficient input . yet another practical aspect which has not received enough attention in the literature",
    "is the sometimes overly complex structure of the models as perceived by end users .",
    "very often the complexity of the models makes them hard to be understood and , hence , affects their acceptance within an organization .",
    "the approach presented here aims to overcome the above mentioned difficulties and is in its spirit similar to the one reported by @xcite .",
    "the content , however , is quite different since the presented model has more solid theoretical background , is easier to implement and use and is capable of covering fully featured multi - factor setup .",
    "the model described here was developed with kiss principle in mind . while based on the previous author s research on the analytical tractability of multi - factor models @xcite , the proposed model has very simple and intuitive structure . despite the simple structure , the model produces meaningful and reasonably accurate results and",
    "can be used by financial institutions for any of the purposes described above . in particular",
    ", the problem of capital allocation has a simple and time - efficient solution allowing real - time risk - based pricing . from conceptual point of view ,",
    "one of the most attractive features of the model is its ability to quantify risk concentrations on both sector and obligor levels in a similar fashion .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "a short description of structural multi - factor model and the necessary theoretical background are given in section [ sec : background ] .",
    "mathematical foundations of the proposed model are presented in section [ sec : kiss ] and are substantiated by benchmarking with monte carlo simulations in section [ sec : benchmarking ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] contains some concluding remarks and summarizes the presentation .",
    "let us consider a portfolio of credit risky facilities with loss functions @xmath0 at horizon ( one year ) being a function of random variables ( normalized asset returns ) @xmath1 .",
    "dependencies within the portfolio are modeled by means of a set of common factors @xmath2 : @xmath3 the random variables @xmath4 are independent and standard normally distributed . the instrument specific @xmath5 and @xmath6 define the systematic sensitivities of the instruments .",
    "the latter are subject to normalization condition @xmath7 .",
    "the idiosyncratic risk components are represented by @xmath8 .",
    "the economic capital of the portfolio is defined as na @xmath9 - quantile ( usually set to 99.9% or higher ) of the portfolio loss distribution @xmath10 relative to the expected loss of the portfolio : @xmath11 - \\text{e}[l]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above quantifies the overall portfolio risk which can be consistently distributed between the underlying facilities using the euler principle as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see e.g. ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a weight of the @xmath14th asset in the portfolio . to simplify the notations",
    ", these weights will not be written explicitly in what follows .",
    "no closed form analytical solution exists for either portfolio ec or its allocation @xmath15 in general case .",
    "however , in a single - factor case , i.e. one common factor @xmath16 and @xmath17 for any @xmath14 , the portfolio loss distribution @xmath18 quantile can be trivially found to be is an invertible function . ]",
    "@xmath19=l_{1f}(\\eta_{1f}=n^{-1}(\\alpha))$ ] , where @xmath20 is an inverse cumulative standard distribution function .",
    "this provides motivation to look for a solution of in a form of a sum of a single factor approximation and some corrections ( for detailed explanation of this approach see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath21 = q_\\alpha [ l_{1f } ] + \\delta q_{\\alpha}[\\delta l_{mf } ] , \\qquad l_{1f } = \\text{e}[l|\\eta_{1f } ] , \\quad \\text{e}[l_{mf } ] = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is conditional on the single factor value loss distribution of the portfolio .",
    "the single factor is constructed as a linear combination of the systematic factors @xmath22 with the normalization condition @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , the choice of @xmath16 significantly affects the quality of the approximation and will be given a particular attention in what follows .",
    "the conditional expectation series expansion technique @xcite can be applied to facilitate calculations of @xmath24 .",
    "translated to the notations introduced here this technique allows writing the conditional portfolio loss distribution @xmath18 as a sum of the conditional expectations of the constituents @xmath25 $ ] which can be expressed as : @xmath26 where the inner vector product @xmath27 stands for @xmath28 and @xmath29 are hermite polynomials .",
    "the series converge very well provided values of @xmath30 are not too close to 1 ( which is the case in practice ) and allow for very fast ( re)calculations of the conditional expectations once the constants @xmath31 have been computed .",
    "the above technique is particularly useful when considering arbitrary loss functions @xmath32 .",
    "as long as credit portfolio modeling is concerned , it became a common practice to distinguish the unsystematic @xmath2 and the idiosyncratic @xmath8 risk components .",
    "the usual assumption is that the former drive the portfolio risk dynamics while the latter only give minor contributions .",
    "however , the two sets of random variables do not differ from mathematical point of view .",
    "in fact , one can not draw a clear line between the systematic and idiosyncratic components using practical considerations either .",
    "indeed , imagine that the portfolio contains a single relatively big exposure or a set of exposures corresponding to the same borrower and , hence , sharing the same idiosyncratic random variable @xmath33 .",
    "depending on the size of this exposure(s ) , the risk brought to the portfolio by @xmath33 may be higher than the one originating from some or even all of the systematic factors @xmath2 .",
    "big enough exposure will eventually dominate the portfolio dynamics even if its sensitivity @xmath34 to the systematic factors is zero . introducing credit contagion effects by assigning more than one overlapping idiosyncratic factors to a group of dependent borrowers makes it even harder to make a distinction between the systematic and idiosyncratic factors .",
    "treating the systematic and the idiosyncratic risk equally not only simplifies the model structure , but also allows straightforward incorporation of the borrower concentration effects into the portfolio risk metrics .",
    "the notations used so far can be generalized as follows . for @xmath35 common factors @xmath2 and the portfolio consisting of @xmath36 borrowers let us introduce @xmath37 the single factor approximation @xmath18 of the portfolio loss",
    "can be written as @xmath38    unification of the systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors results in idiosyncratic factors being incorporated in @xmath39 which , as will be shown , defines the portfolio risk dynamics .",
    "thus , the idiosyncratic risk is accounted for in the same fashion as the systematic one .      as was mentioned before",
    ", analytical tractability of the single factor case is the starting point for approaching the more general multi - factor setup . starting with a single factor approximation and calculating multi - factor ( including idiosyncratic ) adjustments as in",
    ", one can in principle calculate the portfolio economic capital .",
    "this approach , however , suffers from some difficulties .",
    "first , the choice of @xmath16 is not obvious , yet a very important first step .",
    "next , calculations of the multi - factor corrections may be quite laborious and hardware demanding . finally ,",
    "as will be demonstrated later , the multi - factor corrections are not guaranteed to be convergent .    instead of trying to overcome the difficulties associated with the multi - factor adjustments calculations ,",
    "let us put all the efforts into constructing the single - factor approximation .",
    "some factor @xmath40 should exist which maximizes the relative contribution of the single - factor approximation in and , thus , diminishing the relative importance of the multi - factor corrections .",
    "assuming that the multi - factor corrections give positive contribution to the @xmath9-quantile of the portfolio loss distribution @xmath41 , the optimization problem reduces to maximization of the contribution from the single - factor approximation @xmath18 : @xmath42 \\approx \\max_{1f } q_\\alpha [ l_{1f}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the validity of this crucial assumption will be substantiated later in section [ sec : benchmarking ] by benchmarking with monte carlo simulations .    from now on let us define the economic capital ec of the credit portfolio as an @xmath9-quantile of the optimal single factor distribution @xmath18 . using the notations introduced in this section the economic capital can be written as @xmath43 , \\qquad r_i=\\vec{\\alpha}\\cdot\\vec{\\rho_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the optimal single factor is defined by @xmath39 which maximizes the above expression @xmath44 and has the following solution @xmath45 this equation , however , contains @xmath39 on both sides ( @xmath46 on the right contains @xmath9 ) and does not allow a straightforward analytical solution .",
    "the problem can still be solved numerically by applying , for example , the method of steepest descent .",
    "based on , the following starting point can be suggested @xmath47 the calculations can be significantly facilitated by the series expansion . in practice ,",
    "only few iterations are needed to have an accurate solution to the optimization problem .",
    "the calculations are not hardware demanding and very fast .",
    "the optimal single factor defined by leads to another simplification for the portfolio capital allocation problem .",
    "the individual capital contributions @xmath48\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be written as @xmath49 + \\sum_j\\frac{\\partial\\overline{l}_i}{\\partial r_i}\\vec{\\rho}_j\\cdot w_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_i}\\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\|\\vec{p}\\| } = \\overline{l}_i(\\vec{\\alpha}\\vec{\\rho}_i ) - \\text{e}[l_i]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the third term can be shown to be zero : @xmath50 in other words , the choice of @xmath39 according to leads to particularly simple expressions for capital contributions .",
    "the overall portfolio ec is a sum of conditional expectations of the excess losses @xmath51 $ ] which happen to coincide with the individual capital contributions .",
    "let us emphasize that once the optimal single factor has been computed , the set of parameters @xmath39 is sufficient to perform the capital allocation calculations .",
    "this allows real time calculations necessary for risk - based pricing .",
    "in fact , the proposed method for the economic capital calculations and its allocation is so efficient that the calculations can be performed on huge portfolios containing millions of facilities in minutes using entry level desktop computer . the accuracy of the method is demonstrated in the next section through benchmarking against monte carlo simulations .",
    "to highlight the points made and substantiate the assumptions used in the previous section , let us compare the performance ( accuracy ) of the proposed analytical approximation with monte carlo simulations . to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed technique , the comparison analysis will also cover the previously reported analytical technique @xcite which , in contrast with the one presented here , aims at precise calculations of the multi - factor corrections in .",

    "each loan has sensitivity @xmath54 to the single systematic factor @xmath55 and a unique idiosyncratic component @xmath33 .",
    "the loss at horizon functions are @xmath56 where @xmath57",
    "are _ probabilities of default _ and are equal for all the loans . two sets of experiments were conducted with pd=1% and pd=0.1% .",
    "the loss severities @xmath58 are initially set equal to all loans in the portfolio .",
    "the concentration effects are studied by gradually increasing the loss severity of one of the loans and examining the impact on the portfolio ec . the confidence level for ec",
    "is set to 99.9% except for the last experiment where the dependency of the ec on the confidence level was investigated for fixed 10% concentration .",
    "both ec and concentration are measured as a fraction of the total portfolio exposure ( i.e. the sum of all the loss severities ) .",

    "the single systematic factor @xmath55 was used for the single - factor approximation .",
    "based on the results of the comparison presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : artificial ] , one can conclude the following .",
    "multi - factor corrections may lead to very accurate results in case of moderate concentrations ( pd=1% , concentration @xmath59 10% ) . in case of high concentrations , however , the results suggest that the higher order ( 3rd order in this case ) multi - factor corrections are divergent , while limiting the multi - factor contributions to the 2nd order corrections leads to significant underestimation of ec .    the kiss model , on the other hand , despite being not extremely accurate ,",
    "produces robust and reliable ec estimates for a wide range of parameters .",
    "this is especially obvious when studying the dependency of the portfolio ec on the confidence level .      here",
    "the analysis of the previous section is complemented by the one conducted on more realistic portfolio .",
    "the portfolio consisted of 2,000 loans to distinct customers randomly selected from a loan portfolio of a large european bank .",
    "the set of common systematic factors covering 45 geographic regions and 61 regions , as well as the valuation function at horizon @xmath60 used in the experiment were similar to those of the portfoliomanager @xcite model .",
    "both the portfolio ec and its allocation @xmath15 were estimated using unbiased monte carlo simulations .",
    "the confidence level was set to 99.9% and the ec contributions were estimated as average realized values in the interval 99.85%-99.95% .",
    "a total of @xmath61 ( ten billion ) scenarios were used .",
    "the simulation - based estimates were compared to both the kiss model outcome as well as with the output of the approach based on the calculations of the multi - factor corrections in . in the latter case the single - factor @xmath40 used as a starting point",
    "was obtained using restricted to systematic components .",
    "second ( @xmath62 ) and third order ( @xmath63 ) corrections were calculated .",
    "the results on the portfolio level are summarized in table [ tab : portfolio ] and the facility - level results are presented as scatter plots in fig.[fig : realistic ] .",
    "c c c c 1f & kiss & 1f+mf2 & 1f+mf2+mf3 +   + -4.3% & -2.0% & -0.5% & -0.1% +    on the portfolio level the accuracy of the proposed approximation is more than sufficient for any practical purposes .",
    "the performance may seem to be less impressive on the facility level . as expected , the most significant mismatch is observed for the facilities with high concentrations of capital .",
    "these discrepancies , however , do not jeopardize the practical validity of the kiss model .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the input parameters observed in practice ( i.e. default rates , recoveries , correlation parameters , etc ) as well as dependencies on the modeling assumptions diminish to large extent the approximation errors of the proposed technique .",
