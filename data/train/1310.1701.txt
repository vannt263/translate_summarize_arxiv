    "the deviation of the light rays in the gravitational fields is referred to gravitational lensing .",
    "the gravitational lensing ( gl ) in the weak limit has been used to test the general relativity since its beginning @xcite .",
    "but , this theory in the weak limit was not able to describe the high bending and looping of the light rays . hence , scientist community stated this phenomenon in the strong filed regime . in the strong field limit ,",
    "the light rays pass very close to black hole and one set of infinitive relativistic `` ghost '' images would be produce on each side of black hole .",
    "these images are produced due to the light rays wind one or several times around the black hole before reaching to observer . at first , this phenomenon was proposed by darwin @xcite .",
    "several studies of null geodesics in the strong gravitational field have been done in the past years @xcite-@xcite . in 2000 ,",
    "virbhadra and ellis showed that a source of light behind a schwarzschild black hole would product an infinitive series of images on each side of the massive object @xcite .",
    "theses relativistic images are formed when the light rays travel very close to the black hole horizon , wind several times around the black hole before appearing at observer . by an alternative method , frittelli et al . obtained an exact lens equation , integral expression for deflection and compared their results with virbhadra et al @xcite .",
    "a new technic was proposed by bozza et al . to find the position of the relativistic images and their magnification @xcite .",
    "they used the first two terms of approximation to study schwarzschild black hole lensing .",
    "this method was applied to other works such as eiroa , romero and torres studied a reissner - nordstrom black hole lensing@xcite ; petters calculated relativistic effects on microlensing events @xcite .",
    "afterward , the generalization of bozza s method for spherically symetric metric was developed in @xcite .",
    "bozza compared the image patterns for several interesting backgrounds and showed that by the separation of the first two relativistic images , we can distinguish two different collapsed objects .",
    "further studies were developed for other black holes and metrics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ the gravitational lenses are important tools for probing the universe . in refs .",
    "@xcite narasimha and chitre predicted that the gravitational lensing of dark matter can give the useful data about the position of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "also , the gravitational lens are used to detect the exotic objects in the universe , such as cosmic strings @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the gravitational theories in higher dimensions have attracted considerable attention .",
    "one of these higher dimension gravities is the supersymmetric string theory .",
    "einstein - gauss - bonnet ( @xmath6 ) theory , which emerges as the low - energy limit of this theory , can be considered as an effective model of gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "this theory yields a correction to einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term involves up to second- order derivatives of the metric with the same degrees of freedom as the einstein theory @xcite .",
    "the variation of egb action has different solutions and the spherically symmetric solution in the presence of gauss - bonnet gravity was obtained by boulwar and deser @xcite and charged black hole one is found by wiltshire @xcite .",
    "the properties of the gauss - bonnet black holes have been studied in refs . @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we study the strong gravitational lensing and obtain the logarithmic deflection angle and corresponding coefficients . in the final we investigated some properties of relativistic images .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly present the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "section 3 is devoted to investigate the strong gravitational lensing in the presence of gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we consider the logarithmic term which was proposed by bozza , and obtain its parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section 4",
    ", some properties of relativistic images will be studied . finally , in the last section we present summery .",
    "the action of einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity in five dimensional is given by @xcite , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are ricci scalar and gauss - bonnet constant respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is five - dimensional newton s constant and @xmath11 is the gauss - bonnet term as follows , @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are ricci tensor and riemann tensor respectively .",
    "note that the indexes run over the components of five dimensional space .",
    "the exact and spherically metric solution of the above action have been founded by boulware and deser @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16    here @xmath17 is related to @xmath18 mass and note that we set @xmath19 . for simplicity",
    ", we introduce the dimensionless quantities as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "so , we have , @xmath22 when @xmath23 tends to zero the warp factor of the myers - perry metric is obtained @xcite .",
    "the solution of @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the horizon radius of the black hole .",
    "the variation of the horizon is plotted with respect to @xmath26 in figure 1 .",
    "the lens equation for a source of light and an observer situated at large distances from a lens(deflector ) is given by @xcite , @xmath27 where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the lens - source and observer - source diameter distance , respectively .",
    "the angular positions of source and images with respect to the optical axis ( the line joining the observer and center of the lens ) are represented by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the deflection of the light rays denotes by @xmath32 which can be positive , @xmath33 ( bending toward the lens ) or be negative , @xmath34 ( bending away from the lens ) . in the next section",
    ", we will obtain the deflection angle .",
    "the particular distance from the center of the lens to the null geodesic at the source position is called impact parameter , which is given by following expression , @xmath35 we can find the angular positions of images by the intersection of two functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 vs @xmath31 for the same side and vs @xmath38 for opposite side .",
    "in addition to the primary and secondary image positions ( due to the weak limit ) , there is a sequence of intersections that show the angular positions of the relativistic images .",
    "these points are very close to each other , so they are not distinguishable .",
    "for this reason , we call them relativistic images .",
    "these images are due to the bending of light rays more than @xmath39 .",
    "+ now , we are going to investigate the deflection angle in the presence of gauss - bonnet correction gravity . by using the null geodesic equation for the following standard background metric ,",
    "@xmath40 one can find the following equations , @xmath41 @xmath42.\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the energy of photon and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are angular momentums in @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions . here",
    "a dot denotes derivation with respect to affine parameter . if we consider the @xmath31 component of geodesic equations in the equatorial plane @xmath48 ) , we have @xmath49= \\dot{\\phi}l_\\psi=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , if we consider @xmath50 , the deflection angle of light ray becomes zero and this is illegal , therefor we set @xmath51 . for a light ray coming from infinity the deflection angle in the directions @xmath46",
    "is given by @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53^ { -\\frac{1}{2}}\\frac{dx}{x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the closet approach distance for the light ray when it passes near the lens .",
    "the impact parameter for the closet approach is expressed by , @xmath55 the above relation is obtained from the null geodesic equation ( [ rgeo ] ) with setting @xmath56 by using ( [ j ] ) and ( [ impact ] ) one can relate the image position to the closet approach and this relation allows us to write the deflection angle as a function of image position .",
    "the image position is plotted as a function of the closest approach in figure 2 .",
    "we see that the image positions and distances between relativistic images reduce by increasing the gauss - bonnet parameter . for the large values of @xmath54",
    "the curves coincide for any value of gauss - bonnet parameter and this means that primary and secondary image position remain unchanged .",
    "there is a minimum value for the closest approach that is called the photon sphere radius and is a @xmath57const null geodesic .",
    "the photon sphere is the root of derivative of the impact parameter with respect to @xmath54 which is given by , @xmath58 the dashed curve in the figure 1 shows the variation of photon sphere radius .",
    "it decreases with increasing the gauss - bonnet parameter and tends to zero at @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath54 asymptotically approaches the photon sphere radius , the photon reveals around the lens more times and the deflection angle diverges as @xmath54 tends to photon sphere .",
    "we can rewrite the equation  ( [ alpha ] ) as , @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath63 diverges as @xmath64 approaches to zero .",

    "the divergence is of order @xmath81 , that makes the integral divergent logarithmically .",
    "therefor , the deflection angle can be approximated in the following form @xcite @xmath82    where @xmath83}{u_{ps}\\sqrt{\\mathcal{f}^3(x_{ps})\\mathcal{c}(x_{ps } ) } } \\approx0.6902 + 0.154\\,a+0.373\\,a^2\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & b_r = i_r(x_{ps}),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,u_{ps}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{c}(x_{ps})}{\\mathcal{f}(x_{ps})}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath23 tends to zero , we have @xmath84 and @xmath85 , that these values belong to myers - perry metric @xcite . using  ( [ deflection ] ) and  ( [ a ] ) , we can investigate the properties of strong gravitational lensing in the presence of gauss- bonnet correction .",

    "also , coefficients @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and the deflection angle @xmath32 have been plotted with respect to the gauss- bonnet correction in figures 3 - 4 .",
    "we see that by increasing @xmath9 , the deflection angle @xmath32 and @xmath1 increase and @xmath2 decreases .",
    "the deflection angle becomes diverge as @xmath87 .",
    "in the previous section , we investigated the strong gravitational lensing by using a simple and reliable logarithmic formula for deflection angle that was obtained by bozza et al . and obtained corresponding parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "now we study some properties of relativistic images in the presence of gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "when a source , lens , and observer are highly aligned , we can write the lens equation in strong gravitational lensing , as following @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the offset of deflection angle in which all the loops are subtracted , and the integer @xmath90 indicates the @xmath90-th image .",
    "the image position @xmath91 and the image magnification @xmath92 can be approximated as obtained in ref @xcite , @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 @xmath96 is the angular position of @xmath97 .",
    "they separate the outer most image @xmath98 from the others images which are packed together at @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the separation between @xmath98 and @xmath3 and ratio of their magnification can be considered by , @xmath99 the asymptotic position of the set of images @xmath3 can be obtained from the minimum of the impact parameter as , @xmath100 by considering equation ( [ thetainfty ] ) , we can approximate equations ( [ sr ] ) as , @xmath101 another property that can be defined for relativistic images is the relative magnification of the outermost relativistic image with the other ones .",
    "this is shown by @xmath5 which is related to @xmath102 as , @xmath103 if we suppose a five dimensional black hole with mass @xmath104 ( galaxy center mass ) and the distance between the observer and black hole is @xmath105 ( the distance between the sun and galaxy center ) @xcite , we can study the effect of the gauss - bonnet parameter on these quantities .",
