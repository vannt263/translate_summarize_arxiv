    "faithful distribution of photonic entangled states among distantly located parties is one of the important issues in the field of quantum information processing , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite . embedding the quantum states into decoherence - free subspace ( dfs ) consisting of a number of photons or other qubits",

    "<S> we study distribution schemes for a polarization entangled photon pair based on a decoherence - free subspace over lossy quantum channels and propose an efficient scheme that is robust against not only collective phase noises but also general collective noises for two qubits . </S>",
    "<S> while the proposed scheme employs two photons to build the decoherence - free subspace , the success probability is proportional to the channel transmittance of a single photon with the aid of a counter - propagating weak coherent light pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient in the scheme is found to be the reciprocity of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme shares the rest of the properties with the previously proposed schemes , i.e. , it can be realized by linear optical elements and it is robust against the fluctuations in the optical circuits used by the two parties . </S>"
