    "polaris ( @xmath9  umi ) is a short  period ( @xmath10  d ) small  amplitude cepheid with steadily increasing pulsation period @xcite .",
    "the rate of period change is estimated from @xmath11 @xcite to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "these values are over an order of magnitude larger than the rates of period change in most of the cepheids with a period of @xmath13  d. this lead @xcite to the conclusion that polaris is undergoing the first crossing of the instability strip after the main  sequence phase . @xcite and @xcite however casted doubts on this assumption and argued that polaris is evolving along the blue loop .",
    "they also showed that the observed rate of period change is more consistent with predictions from stellar evolution models provided that polaris is currently loosing mass at a rate of @xmath14 .",
    "since about the middle twentieth century polaris showed decrease in photometric and radial velocity amplitudes @xcite .",

    "the cause of the amplitude growth remains uknown .",

    "polaris is the nearest cepheid and determination of its pulsation mode is of great importance in establishing the cepheid period ",

    "@xcite showed that the _ hipparcos _ trigonometrical parallax data are consistent with first overtone pulsation in polaris .",
    "this conclusion was later confirmed by nonlinear stellar pulsation models by @xcite .",
    "however recent measurements of photometric and spectroscopic parallaxes seem to be more consistent with fundamental mode pulsation @xcite .",
    "the hipparcos parallax of @xmath15   mas @xcite implies a distance to polaris of @xmath16   pc but the spectroscopic and photometric parallaxes give the distance from @xmath17  pc @xcite to @xmath18 pc @xcite .",
    "therefore the mean angular diameter of 3.28 mas measured with the navy prototype optical interferometer @xcite corresponds to the linear radius of @xmath19 for the distance @xmath20  pc and @xmath21 for @xmath22  pc .",
    "polaris is the primary component of a close binary system with an orbital period of 29.6  yr .",
    "@xcite directly detected the secondary component using uv images ( @xmath23 ) obtained with the hubble space telescope and found that polaris has a mass in the range @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "this is the first direct estimate of the cepheid dynamical mass .    in this work",

    "we calculate the rates of period change in cepheids with periods near 4  d and determine the evolutionary status of polaris by comparing the observed rate with theoretical predictions . to this end",

    "such an approach the author used earlier to obtain theoretical rates of pulsation period change in lmc and galactic cepheids @xcite . in comparison with previous works both evolutionary and hydrodynamical computations of this study were carried out with improved input physics .",
