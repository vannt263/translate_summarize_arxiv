    "the ejection of plasma in the form of more or less collimated bi - polar flows ( jets ) is arguably one of the most spectacular displays staged by a forming star . over a million years",
    ", these outflows trace the creation of stars from their embryonic emergence as proto - stars , still enveloped in their dense parental cloud , to their birth as t tauri stars surrounded by proto - planetary discs .",
    "the existence of a close relation between the ejection and accretion of matter throughout the ( low - mass @xmath2 ) star s formation history @xcite suggests the presence of a single launching mechanism , which is now widely thought to rest on the presence of a large - scale magnetic field mediating the extraction of gravitational energy from the accreting plasma , and redirecting mass and energy , in the form of kinetic and poynting flux , into bi - polar jets .",
    "the fundamental magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanism for launching and collimating an axisymmetric , self - similar outflow was detailed in analytical work by @xcite and applied to young stellar systems by @xcite ; it was later extended to include non - self similar solutions @xcite and global disc - jet solutions by @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas underlying mhd jet launching were confirmed in time - dependent two - dimensional , axisymmetric numerical simulations @xcite which either included a disc @xcite or prescribed it as boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the early ejection of bipolar outflows was also demonstrated in two- @xcite and three - dimensional mhd simulations of the collapse of pre - stellar dense cores @xcite , which notably included the second collapse and the formation of jets from the protostar @xcite .",
    "in fact , far from being a passive tracers of star formation , these outflows play an active role which is still to be fully understood .",
    "examples include the removal of angular momentum from the accreting flow @xcite , determining the efficiency of star formation by dispersing the accreting envelope @xcite , and sustaining turbulence in their local environment @xcite .    in general , the modelling of collapsing cores and jet launching has been carried out under the simplifying assumption that the angle @xmath0 between the rotation axis and the large - scale magnetic field , is zero .",
    "exceptions are the simulations of @xcite , which however focused mostly on the core and disc dynamics . here we present simulations of the collapse of pre - stellar dense cores with misaligned initial configurations ( @xmath3 ) , and show that the angle @xmath0 is fundamental in determining not only the properties of the outflow , but also the mass accretion onto the core .",
    "in particular we observe the gradual decrease in the mass ejection with increasing angle @xmath0 , until its total suppression for nearly perpendicular configurations .",
    "we follow numerically the gravitational collapse of dense pre - stellar cores , up to , and including the formation of the first ( or adiabatic ) core .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed with ramses @xcite , an adaptive mesh refinement code which uses a godunov - type scheme and constrained transport to solve the ideal mhd equations . throughout the simulations",
    "the jeans length is resolved with at least 10 cells , and a hlld solver is employed .",
    "the initial conditions consist of a one solar mass core whose density profile resembles the observed cores , and is given by @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5 au is the inner cloud radius .",
    "this isothermal cloud ( @xmath6 k ) is placed inside a warm and diffuse medium in pressure equilibrium with the cloud edge , with a contrast of 10 between central , @xmath7 @xmath8 , and edge densities .",
    "the cloud is initially in solid body rotation and threaded by a uniform magnetic field along the @xmath9-axis , whose intensity is proportional to the column density of the cloud .",
    "the rotation axis is in the @xmath10 plane and makes an angle @xmath0 with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "for ease of presentation we define , in addition to the cartesian coordinates @xmath11 , cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 with @xmath13 parallel to the initial rotation axis .",
    "all simulations are characterized by four parameters : the ratio of rotational over gravitational energy ( @xmath14 ) , the ratio of thermal over gravitational energy ( @xmath15 ) , the degree of magnetization @xmath16 , and the angle @xmath0 . only the effects of different @xmath16 ,",
    "the mass - to - flux over critical mass - to - flux ratio , and @xmath0 are investigated in this work .          the general outflow formation and dynamics",
    "are presented in figure  [ figure1 ] . as the initially spherical",
    ", magnetized pre - stellar core undergoes gravitational collapse it flattens preferentially along the magnetic field lines , producing a dynamically - collapsing , magnetized disc - like structure or _ pseudo - disc_. following the isothermal collapse phase , an adiabatic core with densities @xmath17 @xmath8 and a radius @xmath18 au , forms at the centre of the infalling envelope .",
    "the ensuing build - up of a centrifugally supported disc ( or simply _ disc _ ) , with characteristic diameters @xmath19 au , depends on the efficiency of magnetic torques to remove angular momentum from the pseudo - disc . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the magnetic braking efficiency is proportional to @xmath20 , where the characteristic scale - height @xmath21 of the disc is in turn determined by the angle @xmath0 between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis .",
    "increasing their misalignment produces thicker pseudo - discs which are less efficiently braked by the magnetic field , and thus lead more easily to the formation of centrifugally supported discs . in general",
    "we find that outflows are launched for all angles @xmath22 independently of the existence of a centrifugally supported disc .",
    "however when @xmath1 the ejection of matter is essentially suppressed , even when a disc is present .",
    "the remaining outward motions observed in the perpendicular configuration are particularly interesting because mass ejection does not produce either a magnetic cavity , or a jet .",
    "in fact , mass is not launched from the core , but the _ outflow _ traces dense regions of the disc which are at a large radii from the core ( @xmath23 au ) and are being radially expelled by the highly twisted magnetic field .",
    "the outflowing gas propagates perpendicularly to the rotation axis ( see figure  [ figure2 ] ) and in the plane of the disc , with radial ejection and azimuthal speeds , @xmath24 .    for @xmath22 the formation of bipolar outflow begins as the magnetic field lines , connecting the outer regions of the cloud to its rapidly rotating inner regions , undergo strong shear",
    "which results in a significant azimuthal component ( @xmath25 ) of the magnetic field being generated close to the adiabatic core and disc ( if present ) .",
    "the growing magnetic pressure gradient accelerates the plasma , inflating bi - polar magnetic cavities within the infalling envelope . at this stage",
    "the ratio of mhd poynting to kinetic flux magnitudes , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field , and the plasma-@xmath28 , defined as the ratio of the thermal to magnetic pressure , are typically @xmath29 , and @xmath30 in the magnetic cavity .",
    "such `` magnetic tower '' structure is similar to that described by @xcite and re - produced in scaled laboratory experiments by @xcite , and it is inflated by the magnetic field and is not mechanically - driven by wide - angle winds .",
    "at the base of the cavity the continuous generation of @xmath25 provides the poynting flux powering an outflow which originates from the core and a region extending several au around it . depending on the ejection efficiency , which is measured by the ejection index @xmath31 with @xmath32 the mass accretion rate through the disc ,",
    "this outflow can be described as either magneto - centrifugally or magnetic pressure driven @xcite . as we shall see in the next section , the ejection efficiency increase in time and both launching regimes",
    "are attained during the simulations .",
    "the collimation of this `` disc '' wind into a jet depends on the radial distribution of currents ( e.g. @xcite ) , and therefore on the width of the magnetic cavity itself , which takes up the `` return current '' and the magnetic stresses associated with the @xmath25 component of the magnetic field ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the collimation of the magnetic tower depends in turn on the distribution of gas and magnetic field in the surrounding environment , which is swept up into a shock layer delineating the walls of the expanding magnetic tower",
    ". therefore the medium through which the magnetic tower expands plays as well an important role on the overall collimation of the outflow .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows the outflows three - dimensional structure for different @xmath0 , indicating that increasing the misalignment leads to the narrowing and better collimation of the whole magnetic tower .",
    "this is due to the increasing scale - height of the pseudo - disc with @xmath0 , which provides confinement over a longer lenght of the magnetic tower .",
    "in addition , because the outflow is inclined with respect to the pseudo - disc , it tends to propagates into it , leading again to a better lateral confinement , albeit asymmetric .",
    "the difference between the aligned and misaligned cases is also evident in figure [ figure1]d and e , where the base of the magnetic cavity , which is still embedded in the pseudo - disc , is indeed narrower for the misaligned case .",
    "the angle @xmath0 has also a strong impact on the homogeneity of the outflows . we find that for misaligned configurations the outflows undergo precession around the @xmath9-axis , and that this effect is smaller for larger values of @xmath0 , settling within @xmath33 years to an approximately constant angle @xmath34 , which we remind is initially zero .",
    "nutation is very small , and the initial angle between the magnetic field and rotation axis , @xmath0 , remains approximately constant .",
    "typical values of @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , while the magnetic tower is initially launched perpendicular to the pseudo - disc , thus approximately parallel to the magnetic field , the outflow is ejected parallel to the rotation axis of the precessing core / disc , resulting in asymmetric cavities as shown in figure  [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] . at later times",
    "the spatial variability observed in the outflows is mainly the consequence of growing non - axisymmetric current - driven modes and episodic ejections .",
    "the unsteady behaviour appears to be related to the increasing mass ejection efficiency , and build up of @xmath25 in the core / disc @xcite .",
    "the precession present in the misaligned models further helps to seed large kink - like perturbations in the jet body , thus promoting the growth of the instability , which is otherwise artificially suppressed in the aligned case .",
    "the presence of a kink - like instability is indeed expected in jets confined by a helical magnetic field , and in detailed three - dimensional simulations it was also seen to lead to considerable distortions of the jet body and its fragmentation @xcite . in our simulations",
    "we find that the outflows are above the kruskal - shafranov stability threshold , with typical values of the magnetic pitch evaluated along single field lines , @xmath41 au ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "precession and instabilities therefore lead to the fragmentation of the outflow into clumps , which together with the generation of episodic ejection , produce a series of nested cavities and internal shocks , such as those visible in figure [ figure1]e and f , where faster ejections plough through previously launched material .",
    "scaled laboratory astrophysics experiments of compressible , super - magnetosonic mhd flows have also shown that although jets may be episodic and unstable , multiple ejections of magnetic cavities and jets can produce clumpy flows which remain well collimated @xcite .",
    "years , for @xmath36 and @xmath0 equal to ( a ) @xmath42 , ( b ) @xmath43 , ( c ) @xmath44 , ( d ) @xmath45 and ( e ) @xmath46 .",
    "the colours show increasing speeds ( from blue to yellow ) in an onion - like structure .",
    "the black disc - like regions represent densities @xmath47 @xmath8.,width=321 ]      we find that the general trend of mass ejection - accretion during the collapse of a pre - stellar core , is a decrease in the mass ejection efficiency for increasing @xmath0 , which leads to a corresponding increase in the total mass , @xmath48 , accreted onto the central core .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the total mass in the core and outflow ( @xmath49 ) as a function of time .",
    "the outflow is defined as the plasma with @xmath50 km s@xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the unit spherical radius ; the core is defined as the plasma with a particle number density @xmath53 @xmath8 and @xmath54 km s@xmath51 . from mass conservation",
    "the sum @xmath49 is the total _ infall mass _ , @xmath55 , which at early times is seen to be approximately constant , and largely independent of both angle @xmath0 and magnetization @xmath16 .",
    "its value is consistent with that given by @xcite , who considered similarity solutions of the collapse of an unstable isothermal sphere .",
    "the relation between the accreted - ejected mass , and the misalignment of rotation axis and magnetic field , can be understood by considering the total mass outflow rate , @xmath56 . for steady - state ,",
    "axisymmetric flows it may be written as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the mass load per unit time , per unit poloidal magnetic flux , and may also be written in terms of the density , @xmath59 , at the alfvn surface as @xmath60 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we make the simplifying assumptions that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constant over the surface ( @xmath63 ) of the core , so that the integrated mass outflow rate can be approximated by @xmath64 .",
    "we now proceed to establish a scaling relation between the mass ejection rate , @xmath65 , and the mass in the core , @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that the core , of characteristic radius @xmath67 , is in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath68 , and threaded by a constant magnetic flux , @xmath69 . the pressure @xmath70 and density @xmath71 scale as @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , and combining these expression one finds : @xmath74 , @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . the relation obtained for @xmath61 is equivalent to assuming that the launching speed at the core / disc , @xmath79 , scales with the alfvn speed , @xmath80 . from these relations ,",
    "the mass outflow rate is found to scale as a power of the total mass present in the core , @xmath81 , which for the adiabatic core ( @xmath82 gives the linear relation : @xmath83 the characteristic accretion - ejection time - scale , @xmath84 , depends only on the angle @xmath0 , where @xmath85 is the value corresponding to the aligned case ( @xmath86 ) which is to be determined numerically .",
    "we can then combine eq .",
    "[ eq:1 ] with the expression for the mass conservation , @xmath87 , to solve for the mass accreted onto the core as a function of time : @xmath88 and for the total ejected mass : @xmath89 figure  [ figure4 ] shows the simulated infall , core and outflow masses for the case @xmath36 , and for different angles @xmath0 , together with the analytical solutions , which are strictly valid in the regime where @xmath90 .",
    "the results show that at early times the mass in the core is small , the ejection rate is negligible , and mass accretion dominates , @xmath91 , over the mass ejection , which is given by @xmath92 .",
    "the model predicts that within a time - scale @xmath93 the core accretes @xmath94 of its `` final '' mass , which is asymptotically given by @xmath95 ( for @xmath96 ) . since @xmath97 increases with the angle @xmath0 , the initial misalignment between the rotation axis and magnetic field plays a fundamental role in determining the masses of the cores .",
    "the limiting case is for a perpendicular magnetic field and rotation axis ( @xmath98 ) , where no mass is ejected from the core , and its growth is at the ( time - dependent ) mass infall rate @xmath99 .",
    "this case being qualitatively similar to hydrodynamical simulations where no outflows are produced .",
    "the high ejection efficiency predicted by the model at late times is however not energetically favourable .",
    "a fraction of the outflow fails to become trans - alfvnic and eventually falls back onto the core / disc before being reprocessed . by combining the mass conservation equation with the definition of @xmath100",
    ", the time when the limiting ejection efficiency occurs ( @xmath101 for jets with negligible enthalpy ) can be estimated from the relation : @xmath102 @xcite ; where @xmath103 au corresponds to the core radius , and @xmath104 au corresponds to the outer radius of the accretion - ejection structure , where @xmath99 is evaluated . for our model ,",
    "@xmath105^{-1}$ ] , and the time when we expect the the analytical model to overestimate the ejected mass is when @xmath106 , which gives @xmath107 .",
    "this occurs for the aligned case , which is the only model to have reached a high - ejection efficiency , at @xmath108 years , and it is consistent with our estimates . from inspection of the velocity fields",
    ", it is also evident that part of the outflow is failing to be ejected and falls back as a lower density envelope ( @xmath109 cm @xmath110 ) .",
    "this material is visible in the first panel of figure  [ figure4 ] as an increase in the core s mass with respect to the analytical solution .     for different magnetizations @xmath16 and angles @xmath0.,width=321 ]",
    "the results show that with increasing misalignment , the general trend of mass ejection - accretion in collapsing pre - stellar cores is to produce higher mass adiabatic cores , with lower ejection efficiency ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "another consequence is an increase in the bulk speed of the outflow , defined as @xmath112 , with the integral taken over the volume of plasma where @xmath50 km s@xmath51 .",
    "typical values at @xmath113 years are @xmath114 km s@xmath51 , @xmath115 km s@xmath51 and @xmath116 km s@xmath51 , with their ratios consistent with the angle dependence obtained in the analytical model .",
    "this increase in the bulk speed can be understood by considering the expression for the asymptotic jet velocity @xmath117 ( @xcite ) . for misaligned , collapsing pre - stellar cores two factors",
    "contribute to the higher bulk speeds .",
    "the first is related to the magnetic lever arm @xmath118 , which depends on the ejection index through the relation @xmath119 @xcite ; the second is related to the rotational speed , which scales with the core s mass , @xmath120 .",
    "thus at a given time , the more massive cores obtained for larger @xmath0 , and the corresponding lower ejection efficiency , combine to eject faster outflows .",
    "finally we note that following the initial launching of the magnetic tower , as @xmath100 increases in time the outflow from the core / disc is first launched with a relatively large magnetic lever arm , and may be thought of as magneto - centrifugally driven ; at later times , with increasing @xmath100 , the lever arm is small and the outflow may be better described as magnetic pressure driven .",
    "we have presented three - dimensional simulations of the collapse of pre - stellar dense cores with misaligned magnetic field and rotation axis .",
    "imposing non - axisymmetric initial conditions has several , important effects on the formation of the first adiabatic core and its associated outflows .",
    "in particular an increasing angle @xmath0 produces a decrease in the ejection efficiency , leading to the suppression of outflows for @xmath121 and a corresponding increase of the mass of the cores .",
    "in addition we find that the misalignment of magnetic field and rotation axis produces precessing jets which are more susceptible to current - driven instabilities , leading to the formation of heterogeneous , clumpy flows .",
    "these effects are visible even for small @xmath0 , and indicate that aligned configurations may be too idealized , and unable to capture the whole dynamics . to interpret the numerical results we have developed a model which seems to capture the essential features observed in the simulations . in particular we find that for low ejection efficiencies the mass ejection rate , @xmath65 , is proportional to the mass of the core , and that the reduction of @xmath65 with @xmath0 is consistent with a decrease of the magnetic flux threading the ( approximately constant ) core s surface .",
