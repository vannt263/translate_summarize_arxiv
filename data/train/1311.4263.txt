    "orbital magnetism is one of the oldest and most fundamental phenomena .",
    "all our present understanding of magnetism developed from the classical concept of orbital motion , which is much older than the concept of spin .",
    "the orbital magnetization can be probed by many experimental techniques , including susceptibility measurement , electron paramagnetic resonances , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism , neutron diffraction , etc.@xcite    at the same time , the orbital magnetism appears to be one of the most difficult and challenging problems for the theory , especially when it comes to the level of first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "if the methods of spin magnetism are relatively well elaborated , the study of orbital magnetism is sometimes regarded to be on a primitive stage .",
    "there are two reasons for it .",
    "the first one is that the spin magnetism , in principle , allows for the description starting from the limit of homogeneous electron gas , which is widely used as an approximation for the exchange - correlation energy ( the so - called local spin density approximation or lsda ) in the spin - density functional theory ( sdft ) . on the contrary",
    ", the orbital magnetism implies some inhomogeneities of the medium , being associated with either the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction or the external vector potential , which are necessary to induce the magnetization.@xcite therefore , for the correct description of orbital magnetization on the level of first - principles electronic structure calculations , it is essential to go beyond the homogeneous electron gas limit",
    ". furthermore , there may be even more fundamental problem , related to the fact that the kohn - sham sdft ( even the exact one ) does not necessary guarantee to yield correct orbital currents and , therefore , the orbital magnetization , which is defined in terms of these currents.@xcite this means that the orbital magnetization ( or any related to it quantity ) should be treated as an independent variational degree of freedom in the density functional theory ( dft).@xcite historically , this problem in calculations of the orbital magnetization was noticed first , and on earlier stages all the efforts were mainly concentrated on the improvement of sdft , by introducing different kinds of semi - empirical orbital functionals ( refs .  ) or moving in the direction of _ ab initio _ current sdft ( ref .  ) .",
    "most of these theories emphasized the local character of the orbital magnetization , implying that ( i ) it can be computed using the standard expression @xmath5 for the expectation value of the angular momentum operator @xmath6 in terms of the site - diagonal part of the density matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath7 is the bohr magneton in terms of the electron charge ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) , its mass ( @xmath10 ) , the plank constant ( @xmath11 ) , and the velocity of light ( @xmath12 ) ; and ( ii ) the effect of exchange - correlation interactions on @xmath13 can be also treated in the local form , by considering only properly screened on - site interactions and the same site - diagonal elements of the density matrix ( ref .  ) or of the lattice green function ( ref .  ) . even today , the problem of how to `` decorate '' dft in order to describe properly the effects of orbital magnetism in solids is largely unresolved and continues to be one of the most important and interesting issues .    nevertheless , the new turn in the theory of orbital magnetism was not directly related to fundamentals of dft .",
    "it was initiated by another fundamental question of how the orbital magnetization should be computed for extended periodic systems .",
    "this new direction , which we will refer to as the `` modern theory of orbital magnetization '' , emerged nearly one decade ago and is a logical continuation of the similar theory of electric polarization:@xcite as the position operator @xmath14 is not well defined in the bloch representation , similar problem is anticipated for the orbital magnetization operator @xmath15 , which is also expressed through @xmath14 . then , the correct consideration of thermodynamic limit yielded a new and rather nontrivial expression for the orbital magnetization , being another interesting manifestation of the berry - phase physics.@xcite    the modern theory of the orbital magnetization is basically an one - electron theory .",
    "it does not say anything about the form of exchange - correlation interactions .",
    "therefore , it would not be right to think that applications of the modern theory will automatically resolve all previous problems , related to the form of the exchange - correlation functional and limitations of lsda .",
    "practical implementations of the modern theory of orbital magnetization are still rather limited .",
    "moreover , many of them are devoted to rather exotic haldane model hamiltonian,@xcite which is typically used in order to illustrate the basic ideas ( refs .  ) and to test computational schemes ( ref .  ) .",
    "the first - principles calculations were performed only for ferromagnetic metals fe , co , and ni , where the modern theory slightly improves the values of orbital magnetization in comparison with the experimental data,@xcite and the orbital magnetoelectric coupling in insulators.@xcite    at the same time , several important aspects of the modern theory remain obscure . to begin with , even if the previous treatment of the orbital magnetization was incomplete , it is not immediately clear what was missing in the `` standard '' expression ( [ eqn : canonical ] ) and whether it can still be used in practical calculations for real materials .",
    "then , what is the meaning of the new corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : canonical ] ) , suggested by the modern theory ?    in this work ,",
    "we apply the modern theory of the orbital magnetization to the series of representative distorted perovskite transition - metal oxides with the net ferromagnetic ( fm ) moment in the ground state .",
    "particularly , we consider orthorhombic canted spin ferromagnet ytio@xmath0 , and three weak ferromagnets : orthorhombic lamno@xmath0 and yvo@xmath0 , as well as monoclinic yvo@xmath0 .",
    "these compounds differ by the type of the magnetic ground state as well as the microscopic origin of the weak ferromagnetism : regular spin canting caused by dzyloshinskii - moriya interactions in orthorhombic systems ( refs .  ) versus incomplete compensation of magnetic moments between two crystallographic sublattices in monoclinic yvo@xmath0.@xcite the magnetic structure of these materials depends on a subtle interplay of the crystal distortion , relativistic so coupling , and electron correlations in the magnetically active bands .",
    "therefore , from the computational point of view , it is more convenient to work with an effective hubbard - type model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , and focusing on the behavior of these magnetically active bands.@xcite the previous applications showed that such a strategy is very promising and the effective model provides a reliable description for magnetic ground - state properties of ytio@xmath0 , yvo@xmath0 , and lamno@xmath0.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : th ] we briefly remind to the reader the main aspects of the modern theory of the orbital magnetization in solids . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basis ] , we identify the main contributions to the net orbital magnetic moment in the case of basis  when the bloch wavefunction is expanded over localized wannier - type orbitals , centered at magnetic sites . then , if the magnetic sites are located in the centers of inversion ( the case that we consider ) , the net orbital magnetic moment will have two contributions : the local one , which is given by the `` standard '' expression ( [ eqn : canonical ] ) , and an `` itinerant '' correction to it , suggested by the modern theory .",
    "the behavior of the second part is closely related to that of chern invariant , which for the normal insulators with the canted fm structure can be viewed as a `` totally itinerant quantity '' : the chern invariant is given by certain brilloin zone ( bz ) integral .",
    "the individual contributions to this integral in each @xmath4 can be finite .",
    "however , the total integral , which can be regarded as a local ( or site - diagonal ) component of some @xmath4-dependent property , is identically equal to zero .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : details ] we will briefly explain details of our calculations and in sec .  [",
    "sec : res ] we will present numerical results for ytio@xmath0 , yvo@xmath0 , and lamno@xmath0 .",
    "we will show that the `` itinerant '' correction to the net orbital magnetic moment is small",
    ". however , this small value is a result of cancelation of relatively large contributions , coming from different parts of the bz . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] we will summarize our work .",
    "according to the modern theory of the orbital magnetization,@xcite the net orbital magnetic moment of a normal periodic insulator satisfies the following expression : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cell - periodic eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath18 , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath19 , the summation runs over occupied states , and the integration goes over the first bz with the volume @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) was derived using different theoretical frameworks , including semiclassical dynamics of bloch electrons,@xcite the wannier functions technique,@xcite and the perturbation theory in an external magnetic field.@xcite it is important that all these methods yield the same expression for @xmath21 .    in the modern theory of the orbital magnetization ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath21 is closely related to that of chern invariants @xmath22 which was originally introduced to characterize the hall conductance.@xcite for the normal insulators , @xmath23 itself vanishes . nevertheless , the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : chern_tot ] ) ( which is also related to the berry curvature in the multi - band case ) can be finite , depending on the symmetry of the crystal and the type of the magnetic ground state .",
    "thus , the finite value of @xmath21 in normal insulators can be viewed as a result of additional modulation of the berry curvature by the @xmath4-dependent quantities @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , it is understood that all electron - electron interactions are treated in the spirit of kohn - sham dft , that results in the self - consistent determination of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath25 with the so interaction .",
    "it is important that the orbital magnetization ( or related to it orbital currents ) should participate as an independent variable of the energy functional , so that @xmath21 can be found through the expectation value of the angular momentum operator in the basis of occupied kohn - sham orbitals @xmath26 of the hamiltonian @xmath25.@xcite nevertheless , as was explained in the introduction , the form of this functional is not known .",
    "therefore , in practical calculations , we have to rely on additional approximations .",
    "in the present work , we use @xmath25 obtained in the mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation for the effective hubbard - type model , which is derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations and is aimed to capture the behavior of the magnetically active states near the fermi level.@xcite this model hf approach can be viewed as a functional of the site - diagonal density matrix in the basis of localized wannier orbitals , which serve as the basis of the effective low - energy model .",
    "thus , the basic strategy of the present work is the following : ( i ) the hf method is expected to reproduce the local part of the orbital moment , which is related to the site - diagonal density matrix by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : canonical]);@xcite and ( ii ) we hope that it can also serve as a good starting point for the analysis of other contributions to @xmath21 .",
    "another possibility is to use current dft , supplemented with some additional approximations for the exchange - correlation energy.@xcite    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) , which is called the `` local circulation '' @xmath27 , is the lattice periodic contribution from the bulk wannier orbitals , while the second terms ( the `` itinerant circulation '' , @xmath28 ) arises from the surface of the sample and remains finite in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite in the multi - orbital case , each contribution become gauge invariant ( and , therefore , can be treated separately ) if one uses the covariant derivatives:@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the ground - state projector .",
    "the total moment @xmath31 is not affected by the transformation ( [ eqn : covariantd ] ) . moreover , in this covariant form , the formulation becomes gauge invariant not only for the bz integrals , but also for their integrants in each @xmath4-point of the reciprocal space.@xcite the same holds for the chern invariants ( [ eqn : chern_tot ] ) .",
    "this allows us to discuss the @xmath4-dependence of the net orbital magnetic moments .",
    "in this section we will consider how the main expression for @xmath21 [ eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) ] can be reformulated in the presence of basis .",
    "for these purposes , let us expand @xmath32 over some basis of localized orbitals @xmath33 , centered at atomic sites @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of primitive cells , @xmath37 is a combination of spin and orbital indices ( and , if necessary , the site indices in the primitive cell ) .",
    "the basis itself satisfies the orthonormality condition : @xmath38 in our case , @xmath39 is the basis of the wannier functions , used for the construction of the effective low - energy model.@xcite however , it can be viewed in a more general sense : for example , as the basis of nearly orthogonal linear muffin - tin orbitals of the lmto method,@xcite or any orthonormal atomic - like basis .",
    "the use of the basis set is the general practice in numerical calculations .",
    "however , apart from computational issues , the goal of this section is to understand what kind of new contributions is provided by the modern theory of the orbital magnetization [ eq .  ( [ eqn : tot ] ) ] in comparison with the standard calculations , which are frequently formulated in the atomic - like basis and based on the simplified expression ( [ eqn : canonical]).@xcite for these purposes , we take the wavefunctions in the form ( [ eqn : lmtofunc ] ) and substitute them in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) .",
    "then , the * k*-space gradient of @xmath40 will have two contributions : @xmath41 and we have to consider four possible contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . moreover , we assume that all transition - metal sites are located in the inversion centers  the situation , which is indeed realized in perovskites with the @xmath46 and @xmath47 structure",
    ". then , the wannier functions @xmath48 will be either even or odd with respect to the inversion centers , and we will have the following property : @xmath49 in this case , after some tedious but rather straightforward algebra , which is explained in supplemental materials,@xcite one can obtain the following expressions for the local circulation : @xmath50 and the itinerant circulation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the wannier matrix elements of hamiltonian and periodic part of the angular momentum operator ( divided by @xmath11 ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eqn : lbasis ] ) implies that the momentum operator @xmath54 is related to the velocity @xmath55 $ ] in a `` nonrelativistic fashion '' : @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the local circulation has two terms .",
    "the first one ( @xmath57 ) is the standard contribution , that is given by periodic part of the angular momentum operator in the wannier basis . due to orthonormality condition ( [ eqn : orthogon ] ) , the main contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lbasis ] ) arise from the site - diagonal elements with @xmath58 .",
    "it can be best seen in the lmto formulation,@xcite where the tail of the basis function @xmath59 near the atomic site @xmath60 is expanded over energy derivatives of @xmath61 .",
    "then , since the function is orthogonal to its energy derivative , all contributions with @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lbasis ] ) will vanish after the radial integration .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath4 ( @xmath64 ) , and @xmath57 is given by the standard expression , @xmath65 in terms of the density matrix @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67 where @xmath68 $ ] is the site - diagonal matrix and @xmath69 is the trace over @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the remaining term @xmath70 can be viewed as a correction to @xmath57 , suggested by the modern theory of the orbital magnetization .",
    "@xmath3 has the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tot ] ) , and can be obtained after replacing @xmath71 by the column vector @xmath72 $ ] and @xmath24 by the matrix @xmath73 $ ] in the wannier basis .",
    "the same holds for the chern invariants ( [ eqn : chern_tot ] ) , where @xmath71 should be also replaced by @xmath74 .    in the following ,",
    "we will also call @xmath57 the net _ local _ magnetic moment and @xmath3 the _ itinerant correction _ to @xmath57 .",
    "this is because , for normal insulators , the chern invariant itself can be regarded as a totally itinerant quantity : it is given by the bz integral of the berry curvature .",
    "the berry curvature itself is @xmath4-dependent .",
    "however , the local component of it , that is given by the bz integration , is identically equal to zero .",
    "therefore , it is logical to view @xmath3 , whose from is similar to @xmath23 , also as an itinerant contribution to the net orbital magnetic moment .",
    "moreover , for the totally localized states , @xmath75 and @xmath19 will not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath3 will vanish , similar to @xmath23 .",
    "this is another reason why @xmath3 can be associated with the itinerant contribution to the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "one can also paraphrase this discussion in the following way : the berry curvature in the bz integrals ( [ eqn : lcfin])-([eqn : icfin ] ) acts as a `` filter '' , which separates the local part of the orbital magnetization from the itinerant one .",
    "all numerical calculations , reported in this work , have been performed for the effective low - energy model , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "first , we construct the effective hubbard - type model , describing the behavior of magnetically active @xmath76 bands in the case of ytio@xmath0 and yvo@xmath0 , and all @xmath77 bands in the case of lamno@xmath0 . for these purposes , we specify the basis of wannier orbitals , spanning the subspace of these bands in the local - density approximation ( lda ) . then , the parameters of crystal - field splitting , so interaction , and transfer integrals of the effective model are given by the matrix elements of the lda hamiltonian in the wannier basis .",
    "the parameters of screened coulomb and exchange interactions are obtained by combining constrained lda and random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the screening.@xcite after the construction , the model was solved in the hf approximation .",
