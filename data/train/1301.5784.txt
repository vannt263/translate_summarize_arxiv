    "heavy ion collisions at high energy are a situation in which the colliding projectiles contain high densities of gluons , and are possibly subject to the phenomenon of gluon saturation  @xcite : when the gluon occupation number approaches the inverse of the strong coupling constant @xmath0 , the interactions among the gluons become strong , and non - linear effects such as recombination become important .",
    "moreover , in this regime a typical collision involves multiple gluon interactions , as depicted in the figure [ fig : cms ] ( left ) . unlike in the dilute regime , multiple gluons from each projectile can participate in the reaction .",
    "this leads to two complications : we a way to organize and resum all the relevant graphs , and we need multi - gluon distributions to describe the projectiles .",
    "both are provided by the color glass condensate effective theory  @xcite , in which the incoming nuclei are described as collections of color charges moving at the speed of light along the light - cones .    the object that encodes",
    "this information is a probability distribution @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the color charge per unit of transverse area of a given nucleus . in the saturated regime , this density is inversely proportional to the coupling , and observables at leading order are obtained by summing an infinite series of tree diagrams , which can be done more conveniently by solving the classical yang - mills equations , in which the charge density @xmath3 plays the role of a source term .",
    "next - to - leading order corrections are made of one - loop diagrams in a classical background field .",
    "when computing nlo corrections , the cgc should be viewed as an effective theory with an upper cutoff @xmath4 on the longitudinal momentum running in the loop ( see the figure [ fig : cgc ] , left ) , in order to prevent double counting the modes already taken into account via the source @xmath3 .",
    "nlo corrections in general contain logarithms of this unphysical cutoff .",
    "for the cgc framework to be consistent , observables should be cutoff independent in the end .",
    "for a given observable , it is possible to make the distribution @xmath1 $ ] cutoff dependent in order to cancel the cutoff dependence coming from the loop correction . however , for this strategy to be useful in practice , two requirements should be satisfied  :    * the same @xmath1 $ ] should be able to cancel the cutoff dependence of a wide range of observables , * when colliding two such projectiles , each of them should have its own @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "moreover , these distributions should be the same as in simpler collisions such as deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , that involve only one saturated projectile .",
    "under these conditions , the distribution @xmath1 $ ] can be viewed as an intrinsic property of a saturated projectile , and its cutoff dependence reflects changes in its apparent color content due to a change in the resolution scale .",
    "let us start with a reminder of the situation in inclusive dis off a dense nucleus .",
    "thanks to the optical theorem , the total dis cross - section is related to the forward elastic scattering amplitude of the virtual photon on the nucleus , and at lo it corresponds to the scattering of a quark - antiquark fluctuation of the photon off the classical color field @xmath5 of the nucleus ( see the figure [ fig : cgc ] , right )  : @xmath6 note that the @xmath7 pair couples only to the sources up to the longitudinal coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "the other sources are too slow to be seen by the dipole .    at nlo",
    ", one needs corrections involving a gluon , such as the one in the right of the figure [ fig : dis - nlo ] .",
    "the longitudinal momentum of this gluon should be integrated only up to the cutoff @xmath9 of the cgc effective theory . in practice , it is more convenient to include only longitudinal modes in a slice @xmath10 .    at leading log accuracy ,",
    "the contribution of the quantum modes in that strip is  : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an operator that contains functional derivatives with respect to the source @xmath3 , called the jimwlk hamiltonian .",
    "these nlo corrections can be absorbed in the lo result , @xmath13\\,w_\\lambda[\\rho]\\,\\cdots\\ ] ] provided one defines a new effective theory with a lower cutoff @xmath14 and a modified distribution of sources @xmath15 $ ]  : @xmath16\\;w_{\\lambda_0 ^ -}\\ ; , \\quad \\mbox{i.e.}\\quad   \\frac{\\partial w_{\\lambda}}{\\partial\\ln(\\lambda ) } = -{\\cal h}\\,w_{\\lambda}\\ ; .\\ ] ] by solving this equation ( known as the jimwlk equation ) until the cutoff has been lowered to the value @xmath17 , one can sequentially resum the leading log contributions from each of the @xmath18 slices below the original cutoff .",
    "in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , there are now two saturated projectiles , and it is more difficult to extract the logarithms that arise in observables at nlo .",
    "there is however a simple argument explaining qualitatively the universality of the distributions @xmath1 $ ] that describe these projectiles in the cgc framework , illustrated in the figure [ fig : cms ] ( right ) .",
    "the soft gluon radiation responsible for the logarithms of the cutoff takes a long time , much shorter than the collision time that goes like the inverse of the collision energy .",
    "therefore , these gluons must be emitted before the collision , at a time where the separation between the projectiles is space - like .",
    "for this reason , there can not be any cross - talk between the distributions @xmath1 $ ] that describe the two nuclei , and they should be the same as in dis .    in order to illustrate how this works in an actual calculation , let us consider the inclusive gluon spectrum at lo and nlo , illustrated in the two diagrams on the left of the figure [ fig : gluon ] .    at lo ,",
    "the gluon spectrum is quadratic in the retarded solution of the classical yang - mills equation , @xmath19 @xmath20={\\colorb j_1^\\nu}+{\\colorb j_2^\\nu}}\\quad,\\quad \\lim_{t\\to -\\infty}{\\colord{\\cal a}^\\mu(t,\\vec\\x)}=0\\ ; .\\ ] ] at nlo , it involves one - loop graphs in the presence of a background color field .",
    "one can formally express the nlo result as@xcite @xmath21_\\u   \\big[{\\colorb a_\\k^*}\\,{\\mathbbm t}\\big]_\\v + \\int\\limits_{_{\\vec\\u\\in\\sigma } } \\big[{\\colorb{\\bs\\alpha}}\\,{\\mathbbm t}\\big]_\\u \\bigg]\\ ; \\left.{\\colorb\\frac{dn_g}{dyd^2\\vec\\p_\\perp}}\\right|_{_{\\rm lo}}\\ ; , \\label{eq : lonlo}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are small perturbations to the classical field @xmath24 , @xmath25 a surface used to set the initial condition for the fields ( e.g. the light - cone ) , and @xmath26 the functional derivative with respect to the initial classical field at the point @xmath27 .",
    "in this formula , the integration over @xmath28 has a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff @xmath29_\\u   \\big[{\\colorb a_\\k^*}\\,{\\mathbbm t}\\big]_\\v + \\int\\limits_{_{\\vec\\u\\in\\sigma } } \\big[{\\colorb{\\bs\\alpha}}\\,{\\mathbbm t}\\big]_\\u =      \\ln\\left(\\lambda^+\\right)\\,{\\colorb{\\cal h}_1 }      +      \\ln\\left(\\lambda^-\\right)\\,{\\colorb{\\cal h}_2 }      + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are the jimwlk hamiltonians of the two nuclei .",
    "this formula is the formal realization of the causality argument exposed at the beginning of this section , since the logarithms associated to the two cutoffs are accompanied by the jimwlk of the corresponding nucleus , without any mixing .",
    "thanks to this formula , one can absorb the logarithms of the cutoff in jimwlk - evolved distributions of color sources , @xmath31 \\ ; { \\colora w_1\\big[\\rho_{_1}\\big]}\\ ; { \\colorb w_2\\big[\\rho_{_2}\\big ] } \\ ; { \\frac{dn_g[\\rho_{1,2}]}{dy d^2\\vec\\p_\\perp}}\\ ; .\\ ] ] the same factorization holds for multi - gluon inclusive spectra@xcite , and more generally for all the inclusive observables , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : lonlo ] ) is valid .",
    "a natural extension of these results is to study it in the case of quark production . to that effect",
    ", one needs expressions for the quark spectrum at lo and nlo ( see the two diagrams on the right of the figure [ fig : gluon ] ) .",
    "these contributions have been worked out , and it turns out that they are related by a formula similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lonlo])@xcite , @xmath32_\\u   \\big[{\\colorb a_\\k^*}\\,{\\mathbbm t}+\\underline{{\\colorb b_\\k^\\dagger}\\,{\\mathbbm t}_{_\\psi}}\\big]_\\v } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad { + \\int\\limits_{_{\\vec\\u\\in\\sigma } } \\big[{\\colorb{\\bs\\alpha}}\\,{\\mathbbm t}+\\underline{{\\colorb{\\bs\\beta}}\\,{\\mathbbm t}_{_\\psi}}\\big]_\\u \\bigg]\\ ; \\left.{\\colorb\\frac{dn_{_q}}{dyd^2\\vec\\p_\\perp}}\\right|_{_{\\rm lo}}}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the underlined terms are new and contain purely fermionic quantities  : @xmath33 and @xmath34 are small fermionic fields , and where the operator @xmath35 is a functional derivative with respect to the initial value of fermion fields on @xmath25 .",
    "this formula is only the first step ; the second part of this program consists in extracting the logarithms from the new fermionic terms in the operator that appears in the right hand side , and to prove that they are also proportional to the jimwlk hamiltonian .",
