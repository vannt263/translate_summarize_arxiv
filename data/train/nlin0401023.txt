    "at sufficiently low temperatures , particles in a dilute boson gas condense in the ground state , forming a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "this was first observed experimentally in 1995 in na and rb vapors@xcite .    in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "a dilute bec is described by the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with an external potential , which is also called the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation . in particular ,",
    "becs may be considered in the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) regime , with the transverse dimensions of the condensate on the order of its mean healing length @xmath0 ( given by @xmath1 ) and a much larger longitudinal dimension @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath0 is determined by the mean atomic density @xmath2 and the two - body @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath4 , where the interactions between atoms are repulsive if @xmath5 and attractive if @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the quasi-1d regime , which corresponds to cigar - shaped  becs , is described by the 1d limit of the 3d mean - field theory ( rather than by a 1d mean - field theory proper , which would only be appropriate for extremely small transverse dimensions of order @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the condensate wave function @xmath8 obeys the effective 1d gp equation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic mass , @xmath11 is an external potential , @xmath12[1+o(\\eta ^{2})]$ ] , and @xmath13 is the dilute - gas parameter@xcite . experimentally relevant potentials @xmath11 include harmonic traps and periodic potentials ( created as optical lattices , which are denoted ols and arise as interference patterns produced by coherent counterpropagating laser beams illuminating the condensate ) . in the presence of both potentials , @xmath14 + v_{1}x^{2}/2 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the offset of the periodic potential relative to the center of the the parabolic trap . when @xmath16 , the potential is dominated by its periodic component over many periods @xcite ; for example , when @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the parabolic component in @xmath11 is negligible for the 10 periods closest to the trap s center .",
    "in this work , we set @xmath19 and focus entirely on ol potentials .",
    "this assumption is motivated by numerous recent experimental studies of becs in ols @xcite and is widely adopted in theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "multiple - component becs , which constitute the subject of this work , have been considered in a number of theoretical works @xcite .",
    "mixtures of two different species ( such as @xmath20rb and @xmath21rb ) are described by nonlinearly coupled gp equations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the atomic masses of the species , @xmath24 corresponds to the self - scattering length @xmath25 , and @xmath26 depends on the cross - scattering length @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "there are numerous subcases of eqs .",
    "( [ cnls1 ] ) to consider , as various combinations of signs for the scattering coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 may occur .",
    "it is important to note , however , that if @xmath31 are positive ( repulsion between the atoms ) , then @xmath32 is normally positive as well .",
    "however , if @xmath31 are negative ( corresponding to the less typical case of attraction between atoms belonging to a single species ) , then @xmath32 [ see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) ] may be _ either _ positive or negative .",
    "the system ( [ cnls1 ] ) resembles a well - known model describing the nonlinear self - phase - modulation ( spm ) and cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) interactions of light waves with different polarizations or carried by different wavelengths in nonlinear optics @xcite . in the case of optical fibers ,",
    "the evolution variable is the propagation distance @xmath33 ( rather than time ) , and the role of @xmath34 is played by the reduced temporal variable @xmath35 @xcite . in optical models , however , the choice of the nonlinear coefficients is limited to the combinations @xmath36 for orthogonal linear polarizations in a birefringent fiber and @xmath37 for circular polarizations or different carrier wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the latter case is quite important in the application to two - component becs as well , as it occurs if one assumes that the collision lengths for interactions between all the atoms are the same .    another physically interesting feature , which we include in the model to be considered below , is linear coupling between the two wave functions .",
    "this occurs in a mixture of two different spin states of the same isotope , which arises through a resonant microwave field that induces transitions between the states@xcite .",
    "condensates containing two different spin states of @xmath21rb have been created experimentally via sympathetic cooling @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "the normalized coupled gp equations take the form @xmath38 where the self- and cross - scattering coefficients are @xmath39 and @xmath32 , and the linear coupling coefficient is @xmath40 , which can always be made positive without loss of generality .",
    "experimental studies of mixtures of two interconvertible condensates ( with positive scattering lengths ) loaded in an ol have not yet been reported . however , all the necessary experimental ingredients for such a work are currently available . moreover , in a very recent paper @xcite , an experimental procedure , based on ramsey spectroscopy and adjusted exactly for such a system , was elaborated .",
    "experiments in this setting would be quite interesting , as they would allow the study of the direct interplay between two crucially important physical factors used as tools in the current experimental work ",
    "namely , the ol potential and inter - conversion between two different spin states in the bec , controlled by the resonant field .",
    "furthermore , there are now recent experimental results with linearly coupled becs @xcite .",
    "the use of an optical potential in the latter setting is a rather straightforward extension .",
    "the model combining nonlinear xpm and linear couplings , as in eqs .",
    "( [ cnls2 ] ) , occurs in fiber optics as well . in that case",
    ", the linear coupling is generated by a twist applied to the fiber in the case of two linear polarizations , and by an elliptic deformation of the fiber s core in the case of circular polarizations ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however ,  linear coupling is impossible in the case of two different wavelengths .",
    "another optical model , with only linear coupling between two modes , applies to dual - core nonlinear fibers , as discussed in @xcite ( and references therein ) . in the context of becs",
    ", it may correspond to a special case in which the cross - scattering length is made ( very close to ) zero using a feshbach resonance @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to investigate modulated - wave states in the binary bec described by eqs .",
    "( [ cnls2 ] ) , which include both nonlinear and linear couplings and an ol potential .",
    "we stress that the interplay between the microwave - induced linear coupling in the binary model and the ol - induced periodic potential has never before been considered .",
    "as both features represent important laboratory tools , the results reported here suggest possibilities for new experiments . the model we study predicts new dynamical effects , such as oscillations of matter between the linearly - coupled components trapped in the potential wells of the ol .    in our study , we begin by examining plane - wave solutions with @xmath41 . when @xmath42 , we apply a standing - wave ansatz to eq .",
    "( [ cnls2 ] ) , which leads to a system of coupled parametrically forced duffing equations describing the spatial evolution of the fields . using the method of averaging @xcite",
    ", we study periodic solutions of the latter system ( called modulated amplitude wavesand denoted maws ) . the stability of maws ( and the ensuing dynamics , in the case of instability ) is then tested by numerically simulating the underlying system of coupled gp equations .",
    "this approach , though simpler than the more `` rigorous '' computation of linear stability eigenvalues for infinitesimal perturbations , provides a more realistic emulation of physical experiments .",
    "note additionally that although our stability results will be illustrated by a few selected examples , we have checked  by exploring different parameter regions  that these examples represent the maw stability features rather generally .",
    "the maw solutions are especially interesting when the system exhibits a spatial resonance . in this work ,",
    "we consider both non - resonant solutions and solutions featuring a subharmonic resonance of the @xmath43 form .",
    "the latter situation has been studied in the context of period - doubling in _ single - component _ becs in an ol potential @xcite , but  to the best of our knowledge  spatial - resonance states in models of composite becs have not been considered previously .    an alternative ( but less general ) approach to the study of binary becs with linear coupling , loaded into an ol , would be to seek exact elliptic - function solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ cnls2 ] ) for the case of elliptic - function potentials , @xmath44 , as has been done earlier in the two - component model without linear coupling @xcite . in that work , stable standing - wave solutions were found under the assumption that the interaction matrix is positive definite .",
    "this occurs , for instance , when all the interactions are repulsive , although small negative cross - interactions are compatible with this condition as well .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : in section ii , we derive plane - wave solutions and analyze their stability . in section iii , we introduce modulated amplitude waves , and in section iv , we derive and solve averaged equations that describe them in both non - resonant and resonant situations .",
