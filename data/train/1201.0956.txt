    "the problem of the transcritical flow of a bec through the penetrable barriers has been under recent active investigations  @xcite .",
    "the damping processes for the superfluid flow moving through the barrier are of a fundamental interest . in multidimensional case above some critical velocity of the obstacle motion the damping accompanied by the radiation emission  @xcite is observed .",
    "thus in the region when the motion is still superfluid , the velocity is bounded above .",
    "the damping is associated with the landau type damping and related to the emission of the elementary excitations .",
    "landau damping can be described in the framework of the mean field theory and is not associated with thermalization processes  @xcite .",
    "the critical velocity value at which the damping is observed , differs essentially from the values predicted by the landau theory .",
    "as it was shown firstly by feynman  @xcite , the reason is in the nonlinearity of the system . in the case of a quasi 1d bose - einstein condensate flow ,",
    "when passing through a penetrable barrier , some interval of velocities @xmath2 exists , where trains of dark solitons are generated , that leads to deviation from predictions based on the matching with the spectrum of elementary linear excitations  @xcite.in addition in this range of velocities , generation of dispersive shock waves occurs .",
    "experimental proof of the existence of the velocities interval was given in the work  @xcite .",
    "hakim  @xcite has indicated that for supersonic velocities ( including ones above supercritical velocity @xmath3 ) some radiation is still nonzero and its amplitude rapidly decreases at the ratio of the potential variation length to the gpe coherence length .",
    "the amplitude of the wake can be characterized by the fourier transform of the obstacle potential  @xcite .",
    "thus , wide and smooth potentials can be considered as radiationless at velocities above _",
    "supercritical_. seemingly in one dimensional case only stable dark solitons can exist .",
    "peculiarity of the one dimension is in the fact that generation of the solitons is possible till some _ supercritical _ velocity , @xmath3 . above this velocity",
    "the emission is strongly damped and the quasi - superfuidity is restored .",
    "the radiation exists , but exponentially small - decay rate is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the healing length of the order of the dark soliton width .    in this work",
    "we consider the phenomena occurring in the flow of a quasi 1d bec past _ a nonlinear _ barrier which is a localized space inhomogeneity of the the nonlinearity coefficient in the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "such a type of barriers can be formed by some area of bec where the effective value of the atomic scattering length is varied in _",
    "the space_. it can be achieved both by the feshbach resonance techniques  @xcite , and by the local variation of the transverse frequency of the trap potential . in the former case , varying external magnetic field in space near the resonance , one can vary the value of the atomic scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "another way is to use optically induced feshbach resonances  @xcite . in this case",
    "the variation can be achieved by local change in the intensity of a laser field .",
    "variation of @xmath6 in a half space recently has been suggested to generate vortices in bec as a nonlinear piston method  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the works  @xcite where flow of a bec past an obstacle in one dimension was investigated .",
    "we consider two cases , wide obstacle potential and short range one .",
    "let us consider a nonlinear penetrable barrier moving through the elongated bec .",
    "a quasi one dimensional bec can be described by the gross - pitaevsky ( gp ) equation with standard dimensionless variables @xmath7 where @xmath8 @xmath6 is the atomic scattering length , @xmath9 is the transverse frequency of the trap , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the background value of the scattering length @xmath6 . for the further study of the flow problem it is useful to pass to the reference frame moving with the barrier @xmath12 .",
    "so we come to the equation @xmath13 the scattering length can be manipulated with a laser field tuned near a photo association transition , e.g. , close to the resonance of one of the bound @xmath14 levels of the excited molecules .",
    "virtual radiative transitions of a pair of interacting atoms to this level can change the value and even reverse the sign of the scattering length  @xcite .",
    "recently spatial modulations of the atomic scattering length by the optical feshbach resonance method was realized experimentally in bec  @xcite .",
    "such approach implies some spontaneous emission loss which is inherent in the optical feshbach resonance technique .",
    "here we assume that such dissipative effects can be ignored , since they become possible if one uses laser fields of sufficiently high intensity detuned from the resonance .",
    "thus the repulsive nonlinear barrier can be formed by an focused external laser beam with the parameters lying near the optically induced feshbach resonance .",
    "we analyze this case following the method developed in  @xcite for the linear barrier case .",
    "let us pass to the hydrodynamical form for the gp equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "it can be obtained by the following transformation @xmath15 substituting it into ( [ eq1 ] ) and introducing @xmath16 we obtain the system @xmath17 for a wide smooth obstacle potential we can neglect the terms in the bracket in the second equation that corresponds to the hydrodynamical approximation . omitting also primes , for stationary solutions we can put @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and obtain the following system of equations @xmath20 @xmath21 with the boundary conditions @xmath22 integrating over @xmath23 we find @xmath24 @xmath25 eliminating the function @xmath26 from these equations , we get @xmath27\\equiv f(u ) .",
