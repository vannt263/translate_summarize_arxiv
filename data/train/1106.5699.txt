    "the hydrohelium cation heh@xmath0 has always attracted the attention of theorists . with only two electrons and two nuclei ,",
    "it is one of the simplest heteronuclear molecular ions and it has been widely used as a benchmark for theoretical methods . in addition , being composed of the two most abundant species in the universe , it has many astrophysical applications .",
    "heh@xmath0 is thought to be the first molecular ion to form in the early universe , by radiative association of he and h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted to be abundant in various astrophysical objects such as planetary nebulae @xcite , helium - rich white dwarfs @xcite or metal - poor stars @xcite , although to this day it still eludes astrophysical detection .",
    "several studies have been devoted to the search for heh@xmath0 in the planetary nebula ngc 7027 ( see @xcite for a review ) , but it has appeared that its detection would be difficult .",
    "the abundance of heh@xmath0 in astrophysical environments is determined by the balance between creation and destruction mechanisms . in the presence of a central star , such as in the case of planetary nebulae ,",
    "the dominant destruction process of heh@xmath0 is its photodissociation by energetic uv photons .",
    "it can occur trough two dissociative pathways : @xmath7 as a consequence , several theoretical studies of the photodissociation process were realized .",
    "the first theoretical estimate of the photodissociation cross section is due to saha _",
    "@xcite , who considered the transition to the first excited @xmath8 state .",
    "the rate constant for the photodissociation process into the @xmath9 state was first calculated by roberge and dalgarno @xcite using more accurate molecular data , while a calculation including the @xmath10 state and the lowest @xmath11 state was done by basu and barua @xcite .    in 2007 ,",
    "the first experimental data on the photodissociation of heh@xmath0 in its ground @xmath12 state were obtained using the free - electron laser ( fel ) flash in hamburg @xcite , operating in the xuv at a wavelength of 32 nm ( corresponding to an energy of 38.74 ev ) .",
    "one of the main interests of free electron lasers is the possibility to operate at wavelengths below 100 nm , which allows to probe excited electronic states of molecules .",
    "the experiment made at flash consists in a crossed beam photodissociation of heh@xmath0 with three - dimensional reaction imaging .",
    "the events leading to neutral helium fragments were detected , and the kinetic energy release ( ker ) of these fragments was analyzed , along with the angular orientation of the dissociating molecule with respect to the photon polarization . the photodissociation cross section was also determined .",
    "this experiment on the heh@xmath0 system revealed the importance of @xmath13 states in the photodissociation , as well as the dominance of photodissociation perpendicular to the laser polarization and therefore the major role of the @xmath6 states during dissociation .",
    "this demonstrated the necessity of taking into account the perpendicular orientation generally neglected or incompletely considered in previous theoretical models . following the publication of these results , two theoretical studies investigating the role of excited states in the photodissociation process were realized .",
    "dumitriu and saenz @xcite calculated the cross section using a time - independent approach and neglecting the non - adiabatic couplings .",
    "_ @xcite computed the cross section using a time - dependent approach and showed the importance of these couplings in the photodissociation process , but considered only states up to a principal quantum number @xmath14 . despite these extensive calculations ,",
    "an agreement with the experiment was difficult to obtain , one of the main reasons being that the experimental ro - vibrational distribution of the heh@xmath0 ions was not known .",
    "while both theoretical works concluded that the cross section was not significantly affected by rotational excitation , the effect of vibrational excitation was found to be substantial .",
    "the most important unknown quantity is therefore the vibrational distribution of the ions in the experimental source .    in this paper",
    ", we build on the work of sodoga _ et al . _ with the aim to achieve a more detailed comparison with the experiment . by reproducing the ion source conditions",
    ", we determine the ro - vibrational distribution of the experimental ions in the flash experiment , and we use it to compare the theoretical and experimental cross sections . in the meantime , pedersen _ et al .",
    "_ published new results on the photodissociation of heh@xmath0 @xcite . in this new study ,",
    "the authors produced a source of cold ions by trapping the ions for about 100 ms before studying the photodissociation process .",
    "after such a long storage time , it can effectively be considered that all the ions are in the @xmath4 state . moreover ,",
    "the authors were able to detect events leading to the dissociation into he@xmath0 + h. for hot ( vibrationally excited ) and cold ( @xmath4 ) ions , the authors measured the branching ratio between the two dissociation pathways in ( [ photodissociation ] ) as well as the relative contribution of the @xmath15 and @xmath11 states to the process . by investigating theoretically the photodissociation process for both hot and cold ions , we will show that there exists significant discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results .",
    "in particular , we will argue that states with @xmath3 should not play a major role in the photodissociation process at the experimental energy . we will attempt to find the various factors that could explain these conflicting results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ theory ] , we quickly summarize the theoretical method used to treat the photodissociation process . in section [ vib_distrib ]",
    ", we describe the experimental method which allowed the determination of the ro - vibrational distribution . in section",
    "[ results ] , we compare our results with the experimental data , and we discuss the possible reasons for the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "we will only recall here the principal steps in the theoretical description of the photodissociation process .",
    "the reader is referred to references @xcite and @xcite for a complete account of the theoretical methods used in this work .",
    "our approach is based on the separation of the electronic and nuclear motions .",
    "the first step is to solve the electronic schrdinger equation using _ ab initio _ methods , giving access to the potential energy curves ( pec ) and non - adiabatic coupling matrix elements .",
    "the photodissociation cross section is then obtained using a time - dependent approach , which consists in the propagation of wave packets on the coupled electronic states .",
    "the ground state of the heh@xmath0 molecular ion is a @xmath15 state . in the dipole approximation",
    ", the photodissociation can only occur through excited @xmath15 ( parallel orientation of the field with respect with the molecular axis ) and @xmath11 states ( perpendicular orientation ) .",
    "we considered here all the @xmath1 @xmath15 and @xmath11 states of the heh@xmath0 molecular ion .",
    "the potential energy curves for these states have been calculated using the _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry package molpro version 2006.1 @xcite , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "an adapted basis set consisting of the aug - cc - pv5z basis set @xcite supplemented by one contracted gaussian function per orbital per atom up to @xmath2 has been used .",
    "the pec have been calculated at the state - averaged complete active space self - consistent field ( casscf ) level and are shown in figure [ fig_pec ] .",
    "this approach allows us to compute the non - adiabatic radial couplings @xmath16 , which are the matrix elements of the operator @xmath17 in the basis of the adiabatic electronic functions @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "the non - adiabatic radial couplings are used to build the diabatic representation @xcite , and the adiabatic - to - diabatic transformation matrix @xmath20 is the solution to the differential matrix equation @xmath21 we have solved this equation starting from @xmath22 , where we have the initial condition @xmath23 .",
    "the diabatic potential energy curves are the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the matrix of @xmath26 in the adiabatic representation , while the off - diagonal elements of @xmath27 are the diabatic couplings . in the diabatic representation ,",
    "the pec cross and the couplings are a smooth function of the internuclear distance @xmath28 .    in our description of the photodissociation process",
    ", we also included the non - adiabatic rotational couplings , which are the matrix elements of the operator @xmath29 and connect states with @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we computed the dipole matrix elements as they govern the photodissociation process ( see below ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors underline the importance of states with @xmath3 during the photodissociation .",
    "we checked this assumption by introducing the calculated adiabatic pec for the @xmath2 @xmath15 and @xmath11 states obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in our calculations .",
    "however , as we were unable to compute the non - adiabatic couplings between these states , we could only use these states to calculate the photodissociation cross section in the born - oppenheimer approximation ( see section [ section_n=4 ] ) .",
    "the initial wave packet is constructed on each of the excited states by multiplying the wave function of the initial state @xmath31 , with energy @xmath32 , by the matrix element @xmath33 of the dipole operator between the ground state ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and an excited state @xmath36 of the @xmath37 symmetry , @xmath38 the wave functions @xmath31 and the energies @xmath32 were obtained by solving numerically the vibrational schrdinger equation in the potential of the ground state using a b - spline basis set method as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the initial wave packet is propagated in time using the split operator @xcite , which requires the knowledge of the diabatic representation .",
    "the propagator is composed of the potential and kinetic energy operators , the action of which is carried out in the coordinate and momentum representations , respectively .",
    "the switch between the two representations is done using the fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "the time step was 0.2 a.u .",
    ", or 4.84@xmath39 fs . we used a spatial numerical grid covering distances from 0.5 to 100 a.u . ,",
    "divided into @xmath40 equally - spaced intervals . in order to avoid reflections of the wave packet at the end of the grid , we introduced an absorbing potential in the asymptotic region at an internuclear distance @xmath41 a.u",
    ".    the total photodissociation cross section is obtained from the fourier - transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath42 @xcite . however , since the experiment distinguishes between the dissociating channels he + h@xmath0 or he@xmath0 + h , we will only look at the partial cross sections , _",
    "i.e. _ the contribution from each of the excited electronic states .",
    "these are obtained by a method using the fourier transform of the asymptotic wave packets on the electronic states at an internuclear distance @xmath43 , located in the asymptotic region but before the absorbing potential .",
    "at each time , the wave packet is analyzed at the point @xmath44 and the partial cross section as a function of the photon energy @xmath45 for each excited state is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the reduced mass , @xmath48 is the wave number in the electronic channel @xmath36 with an asymptotic energy @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the fine structure constant , @xmath51 is the bohr radius , and @xmath52    starting from an initial level @xmath53 in the ground state , the photoabsorption can excite the molecular ion into @xmath15 states with @xmath54 or @xmath11 states with @xmath55 . to obtain the photodissociation cross section for a given rotational level @xmath53 ,",
    "it is necessary to sum the various contributions as @xmath56 the hnl - london factors @xmath57 indicate how the intensity of a transition is distributed among the rotational branches and are given in ref .",
    "in order to determine the vibrational and rotational distribution prevailing under the conditions of the experiment of pedersen _ et al .",
    "_ , we took advantage of the dissociative charge transfer set - up developed for the characterization of photoions @xcite .",
    "a kev beam of heh@xmath0 ions is accelerated out of a duoplasmatron source operating with a mixture of hydrogen and helium at similar pressure and arc current as in @xcite .",
    "the beam passes through an effusive potassium jet , where charge transfer takes place . as a result , excited heh molecules are formed , that undergo predissociation towards the he + h ground state asymptote : @xmath58 the fragments are detected in coincidence by a pair of position sensitive detectors ( quantar ) , giving access to the total kinetic energy release ( ker ) .",
    "this process has been extensively studied by van der zande _",
    "@xcite , who have identified the contribution of three different molecular states to the predissociation yield , namely the @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 states .",
    "the mechanism is illustrated schematically in figure [ fig_heh ] .",
    "due to energy conservation , the kinetic energy release spectrum exhibits around 8 ev a group of peaks corresponding to the ro - vibrational ladder of an unknown combination of the three states . in order to lift that major limitation of the method , we have set up an electrostatic ion beam trap consisting of a pair of mirror electrodes switched on and off at appropriate times to allow for injection and extraction of an ion bunch . with typical beam lifetimes of about 40",
    "ms , we were able to let the ions cool down to the vibrational ground state before they undergo the charge transfer process in a separate chamber located downstream .",
    "after vibrational cooling , the ker spectra are dominated by the predissociation of the @xmath4 level of the @xmath9 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 molecular states , allowing for an accurate determination of their respective contribution to the signal , together with an effective rotational temperature .",
    "the extracted weights , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath64 for the @xmath9 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 state respectively , are then used to fit a rotational and vibrational heh@xmath0 population to the hot spectra , making use of the franck - condon matrices connecting the ionic and neutral states .",
    "the choice of a boltzmann distribution of rotational states , convolved with the experimental energy resolution , greatly simplifies the otherwise unstable fitting procedure .    ) via photoemission or predissociation .",
    "the corresponding ker is shown on the right of the figure . ]",
    "the vibrational population extracted from measurements performed with a duoplasmatron source operating under conditions similar to the flash experiment @xcite is given in table [ vib_distrib_table ] .",
    "it is similar to the population obtained by van der zande _",
    "@xcite who assumed an equal contribution of the @xmath9 and @xmath62 states , namely a dominant population of @xmath4 with a monotonously decreasing population of higher states , limited to the first five vibrational levels .",
    "while this distribution is almost independent of the source parameters , an extensive rotational excitation is observed , which happens to be very sensitive to the type of ion source ( ecr , duoplasmatron , hollow cathode ) and its operating conditions , with temperatures ranging from 3000 to 5000 k. such a high temperature , already reported by several authors @xcite , is not surprising since the heh@xmath0 creation process involves heavy particle collisions between vibrationally excited h@xmath65 ions and he atoms .",
    "conversely , some vibrational quenching may occur in high pressure sources , although no clear connection could be established between source conditions and internal energy of the ions .",
    "the value quoted here for a duoplasmatron source , @xmath66 k , falls in agreement with the temperature of 3100 k obtained by optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    ".vibrational distribution of the ground @xmath12 state of heh@xmath0 for the experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite and theoretical cross sections for the two dissociating channels in ( [ photodissociation ] ) at @xmath67 ev .",
    "error bars account for both the statistical error and the systematics introduced by the simultaneous fitting of a rotational temperature and a vibrational distribution . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we checked the dependence of the angular branching ratio against a shift in energy of about 0.6 ev , corresponding to the uncertainty on the flash photon energy , as we noted ( see above ) that this could improve the ratio of the cross sections @xmath68 .",
    "while the values presented in tables [ branching_channels ] - [ branching_angular_cold ] are modified by such a shift , this does not resolve the discrepancies between our calculations and the experimental values .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental results are compared with the theoretical results of dumitriu and saenz @xcite and an excellent agreement for the ratio @xmath68 is found for vibrationally cold ions . as pointed out by pedersen _",
    "et al . _ , in the work of dumitriu and saenz there is a clear separation in energy between states dissociating into he + h@xmath0 or he@xmath0 + h ( cf .",
    "figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "these authors conclude that the non - adiabatic couplings will not affect the ratio between the fragments and only take into account a single non - adiabatic radial coupling between two @xmath69 states .",
    "however , it was shown by green _",
    "_ @xcite that the first part of the electronic spectrum up to @xmath14 results from an alternation of states dissociating into he + h@xmath0 or he@xmath0 + h. this was confirmed and extended to @xmath2 states in the recent study of loreau _ et al .",
    "furthermore , the electronic states are strongly coupled , so that the non - adiabatic couplings modify substantially the partial photodissociation cross sections .",
    "in this paper , we have expanded on a previous theoretical investigation of the photodissociation of heh@xmath0 in order to establish a detailed comparison with recent experiments @xcite for vibrational hot or cold ions .",
    "we calculated the photodissociation cross section by propagating wave packets on the coupled potential energy curves of the excited states of the ion . in order to compare our theoretical results with the experimental data",
    ", we have measured the ro - vibrational distribution of the ions using the same source conditions as in the experiment .    with the vibrational distribution",
    ", we have obtained a cross section for dissociation into the he + h@xmath0 channel close to the reported experimental value . to get a good agreement between theory and experiment , it was necessary to take the non - adiabatic radial and rotational couplings into account . on the other hand , our value for the cross section for dissociation into the other channel , he@xmath0 + h , is smaller than the experimental one . for cold ions , only the ratio of the cross sections for the two dissociative channels , @xmath68 , has been reported .",
    "our calculated value is in disagreement with the experimental estimate . to further compare the theory and experiment",
    ", it would be necessary to know the absolute value of the cross sections .",
    "for each dissociative channel , we have also calculated the angular branching ratios .",
    "for both hot and cold ions , the agreement is excellent for dissociation into the he@xmath0 + h channel but it is only qualitative for the he + h@xmath0 channel .",
    "this finding is difficult to explain since the total cross section for he@xmath0 + h is too small compared to the experimental value , while it is in good agreement for he + h@xmath0 . the only way to modify the angular branching ratios while leaving the total cross section unchanged involves the non - adiabatic rotational couplings ; however , their effect was found to be negligible even for large @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the effect of rotational excitation was found to be very small despite the high rotational temperature of the ions in the source .    in our opinion ,",
    "the most surprising conclusion of the experiment is the importance of states with a principal quantum number @xmath3 both for hot and cold ions .",
    "while we were limited to the @xmath1 states due to the difficulty of calculating the non - adiabatic radial couplings for higher lying states , we could still compute the photodissociation cross section including the @xmath2 states in the born - oppenheimer approximation ( that is , neglecting the radial couplings ) . as shown in figures",
    "[ cs_comp_n_v0 ] and [ adia_n_v0 ] , the contribution of the @xmath2 states is negligible for @xmath4 at the experimental energy .",
    "moreover , we argued that the importance of the @xmath3 states should increase with the vibrational excitation of the ions , something that is not seen in the experiment .",
    "the excess kinetic energy associated with higher lying initial vibrational levels ( @xmath70 ev per level ) and higher rotational temperature could easily mask the downward shift of the dissociation energy with increasing principal quantum number of the products .",
    "these counteracting effects require further modeling , which lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "this therefore remains an open question .    due to the complexity of the experiment",
    ", there is however some uncertainty on the results which could affect the comparison . as noted by pedersen _",
    "et al . _ , direct ionization of heh@xmath0 into he@xmath71 +",
    "h@xmath0 becomes possible at the experimental energy for vibrationally excited ions .",
    "this would lead to events appearing as h@xmath0 , which would modify the branching ratios .",
    "however , this would not resolve the discrepancies observed for vibrationally cold ions .",
    "another effect that would affect the determination of the branching ratios is the possible presence of the @xmath72 state of heh@xmath0 in the source .",
    "as it has a very long lifetime @xcite , this state ( which lies about 11 ev above the ground state ) would be present for both hot and cold ions .",
    "the absorption of a 38.7 ev photon by ions in this electronic state would lead to direct ionization , and thus to the observation of he@xmath71 + h@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath72 state has been previously observed in heh@xmath0 sources @xcite .",
    "its presence was inferred from the low kinetic energy released by dissociative charge transfer with an ar target , and its disappearance with ion storage time .",
    "we have repeated this experiment and replaced ar with he , making the charge transfer process more resonant for the @xmath72 state of heh@xmath0 than for its ground state .",
    "no sizeable effect was observed , which contradicts the attribution of the low ker to the @xmath72 state .",
    "it seems thus unlikely that heh@xmath0 is present in the @xmath72 in an amount that would significantly modify the above results .    in conclusion , while we have been able to explain some of the experimental findings , there remains discrepancies between theory and experiment . despite the simplicity of the system considered",
    ", the fact that a large number of excited electronic states play a part in the photodissociation process makes an accurate comparison difficult to achieve . from an experimental perspective",
    ", it would be very interesting to measure the cross sections and branching ratios at lower energy in order to make the comparison with theory easier .",
    "in particular , we observed that the cross section changes very quickly in the region around the experimental photon energy . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the problem is complicated by the fact that the non - adiabatic radial couplings can not be neglected in the treatment of the photodissociation . to investigate the role of the @xmath3 states",
    ", it would therefore be necessary to calculate explicitly these couplings .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of the photodissociation of the hydrohelium cation heh@xmath0 by xuv radiation with the aim to establish a detailed comparison with a recent experimental work carried out at the flash free electron laser using both vibrationally hot and cold ions . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in previous theoretical works , the comparison is hindered by the fact that the experimental ro - vibrational distribution of the ions is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> we determine this distribution using a dissociative charge transfer set - up and the same source conditions as in the flash experiment . using a non - adiabatic time - dependent wave packet method , we calculate the partial photodissociation cross sections for the @xmath1 coupled electronic states of heh@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good agreement with the experiment for the total cross section into the he + h dissociative channel . by performing an adiabatic calculation involving the @xmath2 states , we then show that the experimental observation of the importance of the electronic states with @xmath3 can not be well explained theoretically , especially for cold ( @xmath4 ) ions . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the relative contributions to the cross section of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the experiment is excellent for the he@xmath0 + h channel , but only qualitative for the he + h@xmath0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the factors that could explain the remaining discrepancies between theory and experiment . </S>"
