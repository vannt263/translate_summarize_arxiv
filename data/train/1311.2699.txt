    "the gauge / gravity correspondence provides us a powerful tool to study the strongly coupled field theory via its dual gravity description  @xcite . over the past years",
    "the gauge / gravity duality has been intensively used to study many systems in condensed matter physics .",
    "one of interesting applications of the duality is to study high temperature superconductors , which are supposed to be a strongly coupled system .",
    "the holographic @xmath1-wave superconductor model was first realized via an einstein - maxwell theory coupled to a complex scalar field in a schwarzschild - ads black hole background  @xcite .",
    "the condensation of the scalar breaks the u(1 ) symmetry of the system , mimicking the conductor / superconductor phase transition .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite analytically studied the superconductor phase transition near the critical point . by an su(2 ) gauge field in the bulk , a holographic @xmath2-wave superconductor model was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the condensed vector field breaks the u(1 ) symmetry ( one of subgroup of su(2 ) ) as well as spatial rotational symmetry spontaneously .",
    "an alternative holographic @xmath2-wave superconductor model is realized by condensation of a 2-form field in a five - dimensional gauged supergravity  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the gauss - bonnet term on the @xmath2-wave model is discussed in refs .",
    "very recently a holographic @xmath2-wave superconductor model has been constructed in an einstein - maxwell - complex vector field theory with a negative cosmological constant  @xcite , where a rich phase structure is found than the su(2 ) model .",
    "in addition , the holographic @xmath4-wave superconductor models are also built by introducing a charged massive spin - two field propagating in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was studied in a five - dimensional ads soliton background coupled to a maxwell field and a charged scalar field  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that when the chemical potential is beyond a critical value @xmath5 , the pure ads soliton solution modeling the insulator with a mass gap becomes unstable and results in a new hairy soliton solution dual to a superconducting phase in the boundary field theory .",
    "further studies based on this model can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we stress that those studies are all based on the ads soliton background .",
    "however , for the @xmath2-wave model in the ads soliton background , up to now , the conductivity has been calculated only in the direction perpendicular to the condensed vector  @xcite . to see the anisotropy of the @xmath2-wave superconductor model , it is helpful to calculate the conductivity along the condensed vector .",
    "recently , the phase transitions in many condensed matter systems are found to be governed by the so - called lifshitz fixed points which exhibit the anisotropic scaling of spacetime @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath0 is the dynamical critical exponent representing the anisotropy of the spacetime .",
    "the gravity description dual to this scaling in the @xmath8 dimensional spacetime was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this geometry reduces to the ads spacetime when @xmath12 , while it is a gravity dual with the lifshitz scaling as @xmath13 .",
    "the lifshitz spacetime ( [ asymlifshitzst ] ) can be realized by a massless scalar field coupled to an abelian gauge field in the following action  @xcite @xmath14 the generalization of ( [ asymlifshitzst ] ) to the case with finite temperature is  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 the hawking temperature of the lifshitz black hole is @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the black hole horizon .",
    "it is interesting to construct holographic superconductor model by using lifshitz black hole solutions and to see the effect of the dynamical critical exponent on the properties of holographic superconductors .",

    ", we are going to study systematically the effects of the lifshitz dynamical exponent @xmath0 on the holographic superconductors based on the lifshitz spacetime ( [ lifshitz metric ] ) in the probe limit .",
    "the holographic models include @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave cases .",
    "for all cases , there exists a critical temperature @xmath23 , which decreases when @xmath0 increases ( @xmath24 in @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath27 ) .",

    "as @xmath0 increases , the insulator / superconductor phase transition becomes easy ( the critical chemical potential decreases ) in the @xmath1-wave model ( with a fixed operator dimension ) but difficult ( the critical chemical potential increases ) in the @xmath2-wave model .",

    "in addition , by using the gauge symmetry in ( [ swave action ] ) , we can consider the following ansatz for the scalar field and maxwell field as @xmath39      in this subsection we study the holographic @xmath1-wave superconductor model in the lifshitz black hole background ( [ lifshitz metric ] ) . in this case , the equations of motion ( [ eomofpsiofswave ] ) and ( [ eomofphiofswave ] ) in the background ( [ lifshitz metric ] ) reduce to @xmath40 where a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath41 .",

    "note that in the @xmath27 case , the curves of the condensation for @xmath20 and @xmath22 intersects at some low temperature .",
    "in fact in the numerical calculations , we find that the condensation for the case of @xmath20 in @xmath25 and of @xmath22 in @xmath27 increase slight quickly at low temperature than other curves",
    ". this might be due to the fact that for the cases @xmath20 in @xmath25 and @xmath22 in @xmath27 , there is a logarithmic term in the gauge field @xmath67 expansion near the boundary @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , at the sufficiently low temperature , the backreaction effect of the matter sector on the background geometry becomes important , thus the probe approximation considered in this paper is no longer valid . for a comparison , we list in tab .

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     along the @xmath28 and @xmath30 directions , the position of the second pole in the imaginary part of the conductivity moves toward the right as @xmath0 increases , which means that the energy of the quasiparticle excitation increases as we increase @xmath0 .",
    "what is more , the frequency @xmath76 of the second pole in the @xmath30 direction is larger than @xmath77 in the @xmath28 direction in @xmath27 .",

    "this shows that the analytical method is indeed powerful and universal .",
    "finally we mention here that when @xmath12 and @xmath27 , our results can recover those in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , by numerical and analytical methods we have studied the properties of the holographic superconductor models in @xmath81- and @xmath82-dimensional lifshitz black hole and soliton spacetimes , respectively .",
    "these models correspond to the conductor / superconductor and insulator / superconductor phase transitions in condensed matter physics .",
    "we have discussed the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave models by introducing a complex scalar field and su(2 ) gauge field in the bulk , respectively . we have emphasized the influence of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 on the properties of the holographic superconductor models .",
    "main conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "* in the case with the lifshitz black hole background , for both the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave models , when @xmath0 increases , the critical temperature decreases , which suggests that the phase transition becomes difficult as @xmath0 increases .",
    "when @xmath0 increases , the conductivity is suppressed in both the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave cases ; the difference between the conductivity along the different directions , @xmath29 and @xmath31 , decreases in the @xmath2-wave case .",
    "this indicates that when @xmath0 increases , the anisotropic effect in the @xmath2-wave model becomes weak .",
    "the superfluid density decreases as @xmath0 increases , which is consistent with the behavior of the conductivity .",
    "but , we observed that near the critical point , the condensation always behaves as  @xmath83 in the case with a general @xmath0 and @xmath84 .",
    "this shows that the critical exponent is universal , consistent with the result from the mean field theory . * in the case with the lifshitz soliton background , when @xmath0 increases , the critical chemical potential @xmath5 decreases in the @xmath1-wave models but increases in the @xmath2-wave cases .",
    "this result looks strange , but it can be understood by noting the fact that in the @xmath1-wave case , we fix the dimension of the scalar operator , while in the @xmath2-wave case , the mass of the vector field is fixed ( in fact , the effective mass of the vector field is zero ) . in fig .",
    "[ dgzgspmucfixedm ] we plot the critical chemical potential @xmath5 with various @xmath0 and mass the scalar field in the @xmath1-wave model .",
    "we can see clearly that for a fixed mass , the critical chemical potential increases when @xmath0 increases , which is in agreement with the case of the @xmath2-wave model . in the @xmath2-wave model",
    ", we have found that the difference between @xmath31 and @xmath29 decreases with the increase of @xmath0 , which implies that the increasing @xmath0 suppresses the anisotropy of the @xmath2-wave superconductor .",
    "in addition , near the critical point , the condensation always behaves as @xmath85 in all cases . once again",
    ", this shows the universality of the critical exponent .",
    "+    versus @xmath0 and @xmath61 of the @xmath1-wave models in the 5-dimensional soliton.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] + * in both the cases with the black hole and soliton backgrounds , by employing the sturm - liouville variational method , we have studied the behavior of these holographic superconductor models near the critical point , and obtained consistent results as in the numerical calculation .",
    "this shows that the variational method is quite useful and powerful .    in a word ,",
    "we have seen that when the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 increases , the superconducting phase transition becomes difficult , the superconductivity becomes weak and in the @xmath2-wave case the anisotropy is suppressed .",
    "in addition , we have found that in the @xmath86-dimensional lifshitz soliton background , the reduced equations of motion in both the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave models are the same as those in a @xmath87)-dimensional ads soliton background . as a result , the superconductor models with the @xmath86-dimensional lifshitz soliton background are equivalent to those in a @xmath87)-dimensional ads soliton background .",
    "of course , this holds only in the probe approximation .    in this paper",
    "we have only worked on the probe limit by neglecting the backreaction of the matter fields .",
    "although the probe limit can reveal some significant properties of holographic superconductor model , it has been shown that new phases can emerge ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for example ) and the order of the phase transition can also be changed  @xcite once the backreaction is taken into consideration .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the influence of the backreaction of the matter field to the lifshitz background and to see whether there are some new features beyond the probe limit .",
