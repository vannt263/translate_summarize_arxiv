    "owing to the explosive growth of bandwidth hungry services , high capacity and low cost optical transmission systems are developed to meet the increasingly updated demands . as a multicarrier modulation format , orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) can provide relatively high transmission capacity due to its superiorities in high spectral efficiency and robustness against chromatic dispersion and polarization - mode dispersion @xcite .",
    "the intensity - modulated and direct - detected ( im / dd ) system has lower cost and power consumption compared with coherent system , it can be applied in many scenarios such as metropolitan area networks , access networks , data center interconnects and visible light communications @xcite .",
    "the signal transmitted in im / dd ofdm system must be real and positive . to obtain real signal ,",
    "hermitian symmetry is needed to constrain the input constellations of inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) . to obtain positive signal , dc - offset ofdm ( dco - ofdm ) and asymmetrically clipped optical ofdm ( aco - ofdm ) systems",
    "are most commonly used two schemes to generate positive signal @xcite .",
    "the performance of dco - ofdm strongly depends on the dc - bias level .",
    "if the dc - bias is not large enough , the remaining negative values are clipped at zero level , which can introduce clipping distortions .",
    "if the dc - bias is quite large , this large dc - bias inefficiently occupies lots of optical power .",
    "the optimal dc - bias depends on the constellation size , which limits the performance of dco - ofdm in adaptive systems .",
    "aco - ofdm needs zero dc - bias , all the negative values are clipped at zero level in spite of the constellation size , so that aco - ofdm is more suitable in adaptive systems . however , in aco - ofdm system , only odd subcarriers are used to carry the signal , which leads to the loss of spectral efficiency .",
    "difference types of multi - layered schemes based on aco - ofdm have been proposed to improve the spectral efficiency .",
    "asymmetrically clipped dc biased optical ofdm ( ado - ofdm ) system transmits aco - ofdm on odd subcarriers and dco - ofdm on even subcarriers simultaneously , but the even subcarriers still need dc - bias @xcite .",
    "hybrid aco - ofdm uses aco - ofdm on odd subcarriers and pulse - amplitude - modulation discrete - multi - tone ( pam - dmt ) on even subcarriers , but the real components of even subcarriers are still useless @xcite .",
    "the superposition of more than two layers are proposed further to increase the spectral efficiency .",
    "layered aco - ofdm applies different kinds of aco - ofdm to different layers @xcite .",
    "augmented spectral efficiency discrete multitone ( ase - dmt ) uses pam - dmt on imaginary components of all the subcarriers , and employs layered aco - ofdm on the real components @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the performance of aco - ofdm signal can be improved by extracting useful information from clipping noise on even subcarriers . a novel technique",
    "called diversity combining has been proposed in @xcite , it utilizes the information from both of the odd and even subcarriers , which can also be used in multi - layered schemes based on aco - ofdm to further reduce the effect of noise and achieve better bit error rate ( ber ) performance .    in recent years",
    ", fast ofdm ( fofdm ) based on discrete cosine transform ( dct ) has been investigated in the im / dd optical communication systems to reduce the computational complexity @xcite",
    ". if the inputs of dct or inverse dct ( idct ) are real values , the outputs are also real values .",
    "therefore , the real transformation does not need hermitian symmetry any more , and the one - dimensional modulation has lower computational complexity .",
    "for fofdm system , the interval between subcarriers decreases to half of that in ofdm system , but signal on the positive frequency of fofdm system has corresponding image on negative frequency , so the m - pam fofdm system has the same spectral efficiency and ber performance as m@xmath0-qam ofdm system @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is not difficult to find dct is also very suitable for replacing fft in multi - layered schemes to reduce the computational complexity without any influence on ber performance @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we firstly propose an improved receiver based on diversity combining technique in layered asymmetrically clipped optical fofdm ( aco - fofdm ) for im / dd optical transmission systems .",
    "layered aco - fofdm system improves the spectral efficiency of traditional aco - fofdm system , and the utilization of dct in fofdm system instead of fft in ofdm system can reduce the computational complexity without any influence on ber performance .",
    "simulation results show that the layered aco - fofdm system with improved receiver not only has better ber performance than the system without improved receiver , but also has better ber performance than dco - ofdm system with the optimal dc - bias and the same spectral efficiency .",
    "for traditional aco - fofdm system , only half of the subcarriers are used to carry the signal , which leads to the spectral efficiency of aco - fofdm is half of that of dco - fofdm with the same modulation format . in order to improve the spectral efficiency of aco - fofdm , layered aco - fofdm system is proposed ,",
    "so that signal on different layers can be transmitted simultaneously .",
    "[ transmitter ] reveals the transmitter scheme of layered aco - fofdm system .",
    "the uppercase @xmath1 represents the total number of layers and the lowercase @xmath2 represents the @xmath2-th layer , these notations are employed throughout this paper .",
    "the superposition of multiple layers is performed in frequency domain .",
    "signal on the @xmath3-st layer is the same as that on the traditional aco - fofdm , the @xmath4-th layer occupies half number of subcarriers as the @xmath2-th layer does . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ transmitter ] , for layer 1 , the original bits perform serial to parallel conversion and m - pam mapping at first , then only odd subcarriers are utilized to carry the signal ( index @xmath5 ) .",
    "the real - valued time domain signal is generated after idct , cyclic prefix is added and parallel to serial conversion is performed .",
    "then , all the negative value of this odd - symmetry time domain signal is clipped at zero level .",
    "the clipping noise only falls on the even subcarriers ( index @xmath6 ) , which is incapable to influence the signal on odd subcarriers . for layer 2 ,",
    "the odd subcarriers of remaining unused subcarriers on layer 1 are used ( index @xmath7 ) , and the clipping noise falls on the even subcarriers of remaining unused subcarriers on layer 1 ( index @xmath8 ) . according to this rule , for layer @xmath2 , only the @xmath9 subcarries are utilized to carry the signal , the clipping noise falls on the @xmath10 subcarries . finally , unipolar time domain signals on different layers are generated , signals and clipping noise of the @xmath2-th layer are orthogonal to those on layers @xmath3 to @xmath11 .",
    "afterwards , the unipolar time domain signals on different layers are added to transmit simultaneously .",
    "after digital - to - analog conversion ( dac ) and low pass filter ( lpf ) , the analog electrical signal is modulated to optical carrier .",
    "fig . [ receiver ] reveals receiver scheme of layered aco - fofdm system .",
    "the traditional layered aco - fofdm system only needs conventional receiver before m - pam demapper . to improve the ber performance of layered aco - fofdm system , improved receiver",
    "is appended to conventional receiver .      for traditional aco - fofdm system ,",
    "the received signal @xmath12 on the odd subcarrier can be represented as @xmath13 and the received signal @xmath14 on the even subcarrier can be represented as @xmath15 , @xmath16 means the time domain signal on subcarrier @xmath17 , @xmath18 means the dct operation .",
    "these results are also suitable for higher layers in layered aco - fofdm system . the conventional receiver structure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ conventional - receiver ] .",
    "due to the asymmetric clipping operation of @xmath2-th layer brings clipping noise , which can influence the signal on higher layers , the first objective is to extract the signal @xmath19 on layer 1 from odd subcarriers , this operation can help us regenerate the clipping noise falling on even subcarriers .",
    "it is worth noting that the hard - decision @xcite is applied to get the clipping noise , which means @xmath20 is the firm decision on the constellation values instead of the noisy constellation values with soft - decision .",
    "the hard - decision has better ber performance than soft - decision because more accurate constellation values are used to estimate the clipping noise .",
    "then , the obtained signal on layer 1 can perform @xmath21-point idct , get the absolute value and perform @xmath21-point dct , so that the clipping noise on even subcarriers of layer 1 is obtained .",
    "after subtracting the clipping noise generated by layer 1 , the signal @xmath22 on layer 2 can be extracted .",
    "afterwards , the demodulation process continues in a similar way for all the subsequent layers until the information at all layers is recovered .",
    "the improved receiver is added after the conventional receiver . in the improved receiver ,",
    "diversity combining technique is applied in each layer to improve the ber performance . from conventional receiver the signals on the odd subcarriers of all the layers are obtained , so that the diversity combining technique in improved receiver can be performed on the highest layer @xmath1 at first .",
    "[ improved - receiver ] presents the improved receiver structure of layered aco - fofdm .",
    "if we take noise into consideration , the signals on odd and even subcarriers of layer @xmath1 can be represented as @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the frequency domain noises on odd and even subcarriers of layer @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are just the received signals on odd and even subcarriers , hard - decision is only needed to get the clipping noise .    the diversity combining technique can be applied to make use of the signal on both odd and even subcarriers .",
    "if we separate the odd and even subcarriers signal , load @xmath27 and @xmath28 to only the odd and even subchannels of two separate idcts , we can get the results that @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represent the time domain noises through the corresponding idct .",
    "if we extract the polarity information from odd subcarriers to indicate the sign flipping of even subcarriers , we can obtain another useful signal from even subcarriers , @xmath33    then , the maximal - ratio combining technology can be employed as @xmath34 the combining coefficient @xmath35 is related to signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the snr of @xmath37 and @xmath40 is the snr of @xmath36 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is always a little bit less than 0.5 , the reason is that in the sign flipping process , @xmath36 is influenced by noise , there is a small chance that noise has opposite sign and larger amplitude compared with the corresponding signal , which can lead to sign flipping error in @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath37 always has less snr value than @xmath36 .",
    "finally , @xmath41 inputs dct and the required signal is on the odd subcarriers of layer @xmath1 .    afterwards",
    ", we should perform diversity combining on layer @xmath42 , but signal of layer @xmath1 falls on the even subcarriers of layer @xmath42 . the influence from layer @xmath1 on the even subcarriers of layer @xmath42",

    "to evaluate the ber performance of layered aco - fofdm system with or without improved receiver , we compare them with dco - fofdm system at the same spectral efficiency .",
    "if the constellation sizes on different layers are the same , the spectral efficiency gap between layered aco - fofdm and dco - fofdm can never be eliminated because infinite number of layers are required .",

    "taking practical implementation into consideration , large number of layers introduce more computational complexity , so we utilize 2-layer aco - fofdm system with proper selection of constellation sizes on different layers .",
    "the average signal power applied to each layer is proportion to the number of bits transmitted in each layer .",
    "the constellation size combination mode with the best ber performance for 2-layer aco - fofdm system is chosen according to monte carlo simulations , finding the optimal layer number and constellation size combination mode to get the best ber performance can be fulfilled in the future work .     for dco - fofdm system and layered aco - fofdm system with or without diversity combining .",

    "[ elec ] we can find at fec limit the ber performance of 2-layer aco - fofdm system without diversity combining is only a little bit better than dco - fofdm system when the spectral efficiency is 2 bits / s / hz or 3 bits / s / hz , and its ber performance is worse than dco - fofdm system when the spectral efficiency is 1 bit / s / hz .",
    "however , at fec limit , when the spectral efficiencies are 1 bit / s / hz , 2 bits / s / hz and 3 bits / s / hz , the 2-layer aco - fofdm system with diversity combining can achieve 1.37db , 2.89db and 3.01db ber gains compared with dco - fofdm system , and the improved receiver with diversity combining obtains 2.08 + db , 2.54db and 2.01db ber gains compared with the system without diversity combining .",
