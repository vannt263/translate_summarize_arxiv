    "in phenomenological hadron models nonperturbative gluonic effects are accounted for in a variety of ways . in non - relativistic potential quark models@xcite",
    ", an effective interquark potential is assumed to result from them and the effective hamiltonian is diagonalized in the hilbert space of quarks only . in flux tube models@xcite",
    "one does not completely eliminate the gluons .",
    "their net effect is to generate a color flux tube between quark and antiquark that binds them . in bag like models@xcite nonperturbative gluonic effects",
    "appear in the guise of the bag constant .",
    "they are taken to generate a vacuum pressure which counterbalances that of the ( perturbative ) quarks in the interior of the bag .",
    "gluons in the bag are assumed to be perturbative and responsible for a hyperfine interaction .",
    "all these models are surprisingly successful in describing the hadronic spectrum . except for a few exotic states there seems to be no need for hybrid states , bound states of quarks and gluons .",
    "nevertheless , even one gluon exchange , leads to intermediate states , where the ( constituent ) quarks are not in a color singlet representation and one may wonder , whether the nonperturbative part of their interaction ( for our purposes everything that is not one gluon exchange ) is really as color blind as is generally assumed .",
    "a better understanding of the relation among the various model parameters and the structure of the nonperturbative ground state would also clearly be of interest , and there have been attempts to find a relation between the bag pressure and gluon condensation , and the confining potential in nonrelativistic models and the string tension obtained in lattice calculations@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of a nontrivial gluonic ground state on the _ structure _ of heavy quarkonia .",
    "the nearly nonrelativistic nature of these mesons makes them ideal probes of ground state properties .",
    "their large mass allows for a systematic expansion of the interaction at small distances and we gamble that the lowest dimensional ( gluonic ) condensate suffices for a rudimentary description of the nonperturbative vacuum structure in this case .",
    "we estimate the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in an approach very similar to the one used in qcd - sum rules@xcite using background fields to describe nonperturbative gluons and parametrizing their vacuum matrix elements .",
    "in contrast to the approach taken by voloshin@xcite and leutwyler@xcite , we do not treat the nonperturbative part of the hamiltonian so obtained as small compared to the ( perturbative ) coulomb interaction .",
    "this is probably only the case for quarkonia heavier than botonium@xcite .",
    "it has been previously suggested that the inclusion of the finite correlation of the gauge invariant correlator @xmath2 will strongly diminish the importance of couplings to the background fields , allowing again for a perturbative treatment of them@xcite . in eq.([correlator ] ) @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 s is the color transport operator required for gauge invariance ; @xmath6 are the generators of the gauge group in the fundamental representation",
    ". the correlation length of ( [ correlator ] ) should be no larger than that provided by the mass of the lowest physical state which contributes . in a purely ggluonic theory",
    "this can at best be that corresponding to the lightest glueball .",
    "according to lattice estimates , the lowest glueball mass is probably larger than 1500 mev@xcite , and the correlation length of ( [ correlator ] ) therefore is probably less than 0.13 fm .",
    "the value of 0.22 fm extracted by di giacomo et al.@xcite from a simulation on a modestly sized lattice is probably compatible with this estimate , once errors and finite size effects are taken into account . if one accepts the arguments used for instance in ref.@xcite the nonperturbative effects due to condensates in heavy quarkonia would be exceedingly small and of little importance . to reproduce even the first low lying states of the quarkonia spectrum additional nonperturbative effects , such as a confining potential",
    "are required in the approach of @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out however , that the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) is not the relevant one for heavy quarkonia , because it describes the propagation of gluonic modes in the absence of heavy quarks .",
    "this correlator has very little to do with the low energy interaction in heavy quarkonia : the heavy @xmath7 pair is only rarely destroyed to produce gluonium intermediate states - this is a zweig rule suppressed process , necessitating relatively large momentum and thus having a relatively short correlation length . in heavy quarkonia there almost always is the @xmath7 pair around to screen the color charge of soft effective gluons being exchanged .",
    "we propose that the relevant correlation function is that of a composite color singlet ( scalar ) operator such as @xmath8 in a quarkonium state @xmath9 , written schematically as @xmath10    essentially two different kinds of physical intermediate states contribute to this correlation function :    1 .",
    "glueballs : in this cases the correlation functions factorizes into a decay matrix element of the quarkonium and the correlation function ( [ correlator ] ) - the correlation length of this contribution is essentially given by the lowest glueball mass .",
    "it is the zweig rule suppressed process we mentioned , and we will neglect this contribution for the reasons given above . 2 .",
    "quarkonium states : they only contribute , if the quarkonia have admixtures , where the quark - antiquark pair is in an octet configuration ( with additional gluons forming an overall color - singlet meson ) . if only quark - antiquark ( color-)singlet configurations are considered , the contribution from the excited quarkonia to ( [ correl2 ] ) would vanish by color invariance .",
    "since the mass difference of the lowest quarkonium to the first excited excitation is of the order of 600 mev , one estimates that the correlation function ( [ correl2 ] ) will have a correlation length of about 1/3 fm  much larger than one would expect from glueball intermediate states . as explained in section [ effecham ] we do approximately include such correlations by extending the basis fock - basis for the description of quarkonia by states in which the heavy @xmath11-pair is in an color - octet configuration , with an additional ( soft ) color - octet effective gluon to form the singlet .",
    "we calculate the short distance expansion of the hamiltonian matrix elements in a gauge invariant basis of color singlet states@xcite , including only terms up to order @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "we then obtain the eigenstates by ( numerical ) diagonalization of this hamiltonian matrix and see how far we can go in this approach .",
    "the previous discussion implies that a realistic description of heavy quarkonia within this short distance expansion can only be obtained if the ( background ) gauge invariant basis of ref.@xcite is extended to include states in which the heavy quark - antiquark pair are in a color octet representation but coupled to a nonperturbative gluonic background field@xcite to form an overall color singlet .",
    "diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix leads to a `` color - octet '' component in the wavefunction of heavy quarkonia that takes account of the possibility of color exchange between the valence quarks and the background field .",
    "this component becomes rather large for higher excited states and its coupling to the `` singlet '' is the main reason for the distortion of the coulombic spectrum in this model . in the pseudoscalar meson channel only the few octet states constructed in section [ gaugeinv ] couple and a numerical diagonalization of the resulting system of differential equations is still quite feasible .",
    "recently , calculations of heavy quarkonium annihilation rates have acquired a rigourous theoretical treatment through general factorization formulae@xcite obtained in the context of the effective field theory , nrqcd@xcite . in the factorization formulae short - distance coefficients , calculated in perturbation theory ,",
    "are combined with long - distance matrix elements that can so far only be computed in lattice simulations .",
    "this approach however provided the solution of the long - standing problem of infrared divergences in @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays into light hadrons .",
    "the probability for the @xmath7 pair to be in a color - octet s - wave at the origin is an essential input in this approach . since accurate lattice calculations of this probability are not yet avaiable , it is determined phenomenologically@xcite . in the approach we propose ,",
    "this probability can in principle be computed , since such octet configurations are included in the description of the meson from the outset . in this sense",
    ", our approach could be considered an inexpensive alternative to lattice simulations .    in section [ effecham ]",
    "we derive the effective hamiltonian appropriate for the description of heavy quarkonia .",
    "we first obtain the effective lagrangian to order @xmath0 by a foldy - wouthuysen@xcite transformation . using the background field formalism@xcite and neglecting anharmonic quantum fluctuations",
    "one finally arrives at an effective lagrangian@xcite that includes background fields up to @xmath15 order and which , in the instantaneous approximation , gives rise to an effective hamiltonian that is accurate to order @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "since retardation effects are of order @xmath16 , their consistent inclusion would require a much more elaborate treatment , which would only obscure the basic nonperturbative gluonic effects we want to elucidate here .",
    "numerical diagonalization of this effective hamiltonian in the extended basis then yields ( pseudoscalar ) meson masses and wave functions .",
    "our approach can in principle not be described by an effective potential in the singlet channel@xcite because the elimination of the relative octet states would make it energy dependent .",
    "one can however obtain an energy independent effective potential for infinitely heavy quarks , where all terms of order @xmath0 ( also the kinetic energy ) can be neglected .",
    "this potential should be closely related to the static quark potential one extracts from the wilson loop@xcite .",
    "this potential , which we derive and discuss in section [ effecpot ] , also gives us an idea how far the short distance expansion can be trusted .",
    "we show that although it is apparently linearily rising at intermediate distances @xmath17 , the potential is also compatible with an effective exchange of the gribov type@xcite .    in section [ numres ]",
    "we compare our method to methods relying on @xmath15-order perturbation theory in the background field and to the phenomenological cornell@xcite potential .",
    "we first present results where all potential matrix elements of order @xmath0 are neglected .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculations because only a few basis states couple , but pseudoscalar and vector mesons are degenerate at this level .",
    "we also give the results of a more complete calculation of the pseudoscalar quarkonia which includes the @xmath0 corrections .",
    "section [ concl ] is a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "it is usually assumed that physical states are color singlets . for heavy mesons , where the non - relativistic approximation is adequate , one can represent quark and antiquark fields by 2-component spinors .",
    "gauge invariance of the state requires that color is parallel transported from the the quark to the anti - quark along some path . with a straight path",
    "the quark and anti - quark anti - commutation relations ensure that the basis states are orthogonal@xcite . for simplicity we will restrict ourselves in the following to pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the simplest gauge invariant pseudoscalar state is of the form    @xmath18    where @xmath19 creates a quark with color @xmath20 and spin @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 does the same for an antiquark .",
    "we will refer to such gauge invariant states as singlet states since the quark anti - quark pair at vanishing separation is in a color singlet representation .",
    "we choose for the color transport operator @xmath24 the path ordered exponential ( denoted by @xmath25 ) of gluon operators @xmath26 along a straight line from @xmath27 to @xmath22 .",
    "it is then relatively straightforward to show that canonical anti - commutation relations for the quark and anti - quark operators imply that the singlet meson states ( [ meson ] ) are orthogonal@xcite .",
    "we can also construct gauge invariant basis states where the valence quark anti - quark pair is in a color octet representation at vanishing separation by coupling them to chromo - electric or -magnetic fields .",
    "we shall call these states octet states for obvious reasons .",
    "since the chromomagnetic field @xmath28 transforms as a pseudovector and the chromoelectric field @xmath29 as a vector under rotations and according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group , we extend the basis for pseudoscalar mesons by the states @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 the summation over color indices being implied .",
    "the above states are seen to be mutually orthogonal and normalized by the canonical anti - commutation relations of the quark and anti - quark operators if we assume expectation values    @xmath33    and @xmath34 , which are a consequence of the lorentz- and parity- invariance of the vacuum state @xmath35 .",
    "its nontrivial nature is reflected in a non - vanishing value for @xmath36 , which from qcd sumrule estimates should be close to @xmath37@xcite . if we neglect expectation values of all higher dimensional gluonic operators the states ( [ singlet]),([octet1]),([octet2 ] ) and ( [ octet3 ] ) form a complete orthogonal basis for the valence quarks of heavy pseudoscalar mesons , while the singlet states ( [ singlet ] ) are only complete in this sense if one neglects the non - trivial vacuum structure altogether .",
    "we thus effectively truncate the fock space by taking basis states whose gluonic sector contains at most 1 soft gluonic mode , i.e. we replace the low momentum gluonic modes with octet quantum numbers by zero - modes .",
    "we show in section [ effecham ] that such a severely truncated basis is adequate fo the problem at hand .",
    "note also that lorentz invariance of the ground state @xmath38 forces one to assume that the chromoelectric background field is either antihermitian or that the `` e - states '' have negative norm ( see ( [ phi ] ) ) .",
    "both possibilities lead to a nonhermitian hamiltonian matrix , whose eigenvalues in general are not real .",
    "already the construction of basis states for the mesons on a non - trivial ground state indicates that one can at best hope to find a few stable mesons in this approach .",
    "we assume that a pseudoscalar quarkonium @xmath39 is well described by a linear combination of the above basis states @xmath40",
    "we would like to use the basis constructed in section 2 to approximately diagonalize the qcd hamiltonian for heavy quarkonia .",
    "since low lying heavy quarkonia are generally believed to be of relatively small size , the interaction should be dominated by the perturbative gluon exchange , which leads to a coulomb - like effective potential .",
    "the experimental spectrum deviates however noticeably from a purely coulombic one and can be reasonably well reproduced by the combination of a coulomb- and a linear confining- force .",
    "we wish to emphasize here that the truly long range part of the confining force ( @xmath41 ) is not really tested by the observed quarkonium states@xcite .",
    "our conjecture is , that what has to be included in a systematic approach are the first short distance corrections to the ( perturbative ) coulomb force due to the non - trivial structure of the gluonic ground state .",
    "this was proposed previously but without any tangible results , because the corrections were found to be exceedingly large within the framework of @xmath15-order perturbation theory except for quarkonia beyond bottonium@xcite .",
    "this apparent failure of an idea which we believe is quite well founded , has led us to reexamine the basic procedure used in the evaluation of these effects .    in this section",
    "we outline the derivation of the effective hamiltonian for heavy quarkonia , whose matrix elements are correct up to order @xmath42 and @xmath12 . to this order in the short distance and heavy quark expansion",
    "the nonperturbative aspects of the ground state can be described by the gluon condensate @xmath36 .    the nonrelativistic approximation for heavy quarks is conveniently obtained from the qcd lagrangian    @xmath43    by a foldy - wouthuysen transformation@xcite . in terms of transformed quark fields",

    "they are only coupled in order @xmath0 by the @xmath48 matrices .",
    "it can be reduced to order @xmath16 by another transformation @xmath49 the non - relativistic lagrangian to order @xmath0 finally is @xmath50 which can be written in terms of uncoupled 2-component spinors by decomposing @xmath51 and using the dirac representation of the @xmath52-matrices .    to effect a short distance expansion we separate the gluonic fields in slowly varying background-@xcite(@xmath53 ) and quantum- ( @xmath54 ) fields having high fourier components : @xmath55    the division ( [ separ ] ) can however only be defined if the gauge is fixed . in deriving the spin - dependence of nonperturbative interactions for heavy quarkonia curci",
    "et al.@xcite found a particular gauge very convenient .",
    "we essentially follow their procedure here and impose the coulomb background gauge condition @xmath56 for the quantum fields , where @xmath57 the background fields are defined in a modified schwinger gauge@xcite @xmath58 valid to order @xmath59 , where we assumed that the field - strengths corresponding to the background fields are constant ( or have sufficiently low momenta , such that they can be regarded as essentially constant over the extent of the meson ) .",
    "this definition of the background fields in terms of ( practically ) constant field strengths also gives a definite meaning to the separation in equation ( [ separ ] ) .",
    "it also implies that the background fields in this gauge are ( practically ) time independent  a property which will become useful when a hamiltonian is required .",
    "we next expand the nonrelativistic lagrangian only to second order in the quantum fields and subsequently integrate them out in favor of an effective ( coulombic ) interaction .",
    "although ghost terms are necessary in the gauge defined by ( [ quantum ] ) , they do not contribute to quadratic order in the quantum fields .",
    "our truncation of the interaction terms for the quantum fields eliminates all radiative corrections . to obtain them",
    "one would have to go beyond this approximation and calculate perturbative corrections before eliminating hard gluons .",
    "fortunately , the asymptotic freedom of qcd guarantees that they are only logarithmic at short distances and could be accounted for by a running coupling constant .",
    "these logarithmic corrections to the coulomb potential do not seem to be dramatically important for describing heavy quarkonia spectra@xcite and we will not include them in this study .",
    "the matrix elements of the slowly varying background fields ( @xmath53 ) will however be parameterized .",
    "their amplitude is large and an expansion in the coupling in this case not applicable .",

    "is @xmath73    these rather formidable integro - differential equations for the green functions can formally be solved order by order in the background field @xmath53 .",
    "since we will only retain terms of the hamiltonian matrix proportional to the lowest dimensional condensate @xmath74 , we only keep terms up to second order in the background fields in this gauge ( [ gauge ] ) . as we will see shortly , linear terms in the background field have to be retained ,",
    "although we will assume that @xmath75 , e.g. that global colour- and lorentz- invariance is not broken .    in order to obtain a tractable hamiltonian , further approximations are necessary .",
    "we will neglect all retardation effects in the effective interaction .",
    "this instantaneous approximation is correct to order @xmath0 , because retardation effects are generally expected to be of order @xmath16 .",

    "the terms of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) linear in the chromo -electric and -magnetic fields as well as those proportional to @xmath87 are obviously also not translationally invariant and therefore apparently depend on the chosen gauge fixing point in ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "this gauge dependence of ( [ hamilt ] ) is however absent@xcite in its matrix elements in the basis ( [ singlet]),([octet1]),([octet2 ] ) and ( [ octet3 ] ) .",
    "it cancels against terms which appear when derivatives act on the color transport matrix of the states .",
    "this cancelation of course only works to a certain order in the short distance expansion and only occurs if the hamiltonian and the basis in which it is diagonalized are defined consistently .",
    "this is not a big surprise in any gauge theory , but a gauge invariant scheme to include nonperturbative aspects of the ground state in a hamiltonian formulation without losing gauge invariance was only first proposed in @xcite , but not used to its full extent there . from the above",
    "we see that a short distance expansion in the construction of the basis as well as the hamiltonian to order @xmath12 can be performed and the effects from a nontrivial expectation value @xmath36 consistently included .",
    "the straightforward but lengthy computation of the matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) in the basis for pseudoscalar mesons ( [ meson ] ) to obtain the coupled differential equations ( [ diffeq ] ) for the wavefunctions@xcite will not be exhibited here .",
    "we do however also have to account for matrix elements of the purely gluonic part of the hamiltonian @xmath88 in the basis states ( [ singlet]),([octet1]),([octet2 ] ) and ( [ octet3 ] ) .",
    "the order @xmath21 terms in ( [ gluonic ] ) are due to the 1-loop corrections from the quantum fields .",
    "when these corrections are properly included , the above hamiltonian should be consistent with the trace anomaly@xcite and reproduce the relation between the energy density of the nonperturbative gluonic ground state and the condensate value .",
    "all we will need in the sequel is that this correction is a local operator of dimension 4 and order @xmath21 ( such as @xmath89 ) .    from rotational symmetry",
    "we conclude that only diagonal matrix elements of @xmath90 can be non - vanishing .",
    "since we neglect expectation values of operators with dimension greater than 4 , matrix elements in `` octet''-states ( [ octet1]),([octet2]),([octet3 ] ) vanish in this approximation .    from ( [ phi ] )",
    "we might naively infer that the matrix elements of @xmath90 between `` singlet '' states vanish as well .",
    "phenomenologically we do however need an energy splitting between the `` singlet''- and `` octet''- states .",
    "leutwyler@xcite attributes it to an effective mass of the low frequency gluonic modes .",
    "a more careful examination of contributions from @xmath90 reveals the origin of such an effective mass in the present approach . to obtain the energy of the meson relative to that of the vacuum ,",
    "one has to commute the purely gluonic hamiltonian with the creation operator for the meson .",
    "as discussed previously , gauge invariance requires that this creation operator contains a gluonic string , or color transport matrix . within our approximation",

    "before solving the coupled set of equations ( [ diffeq ] ) by numerical methods , it is instructive to consider the limit of infinitely heavy quarkonia . in this case , all terms proportional to @xmath0 ( including the kinetic energy ) in ( [ diffeq ] ) can be dropped , and the resulting equations give the binding energy @xmath113 for states where the quark and anti - quark are localized a distance @xmath112 apart ( i.e. for wave - functions @xmath114 and @xmath115 all proportional to @xmath116 .",

    "[ fig1](b ) we compare our effective potential ( [ pot ] ) to that extracted from lattice data@xcite and to the phenomenological potential used by ref@xcite .",

    "it is encouraging that our rather crude approximations to the vacuum structure seem to qualitatively reproduce the potential for very heavy quarks at small distances .",
    "the analytical results of this section justify the numerical calculation of `` octet''-components in heavy quarkonia which we now present .",
    "going beyond the static approximation by including the kinetic energy of the quarks but still neglecting coupling terms of order @xmath0 in ( [ diffeq ] ) , the quarkonium spectrum becomes discrete and the following coupled set of differential equations must be solved numerically @xmath130 s(r)&=&-\\frac{\\pi \\phi r}{3\\sqrt{2 } } e_1(r ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\bigl [ 2 m - e-\\frac{1}{m}(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}-\\frac{2}{r^2})+\\frac{1}{6}\\frac{\\alpha_s}{r } \\bigr ] e_1(r)&=&\\frac{\\pi \\phi r}{3\\sqrt{2 } } s(r)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is essentially leutwylers@xcite approximation to the problem , who obtained the perturbation of the coulomb spectrum in @xmath15-order of @xmath131 and found that it is exceedingly large for canonical values of the condensate .",
    "note that the coulomb force is repulsive in the `` octet '' channel and @xmath132-th in strength compared to the `` singlet '' channel ( this is just the ratio of @xmath133 in the two representations ) and the @xmath134-state still decouples in this approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "vector- and pseudoscalar- quarkonia are furthermore still degenerate .",
    "this is expected , since the spin splitting is of order @xmath0 .",
    "it however is another nontrivial consistency check of our method , because the basis states for vector mesons are of course quite different .",
    "nevertheless equivalent equations to ( [ leutapp ] ) result , if @xmath0 potential terms are neglected .",

    "this effect is completely missed if the coupling is treated as a perturbation . to any finite order in perturbation theory",
    "the correction to the coulomb spectrum is real .",
    "perturbation theory does however show that a few ( low lying ) eigenvalues of ( [ leutapp ] ) are real for a sufficiently small @xmath131 . for the canonical value @xmath135",
    "we find numerically @xmath136 stable bound quarkonia in the pseudoscalar channel , depending on the heavy quark mass @xmath80 .    but even for these low states , the deviation of the exact correction to the coulomb eigenvalue from the @xmath15-order estimate is large for the charmonium and bottonium systems as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we conclude with leutwyler@xcite that perturbation theory is not applicable for canonical values of @xmath131 , but that the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian equations ( [ leutapp ] ) do yield reasonable corrections in an exact solution .",
    "the value @xmath137 used by us was ajusted to reproduce the correct splitting between @xmath138 and @xmath139@xcite when @xmath0 terms are included ( see below ) .",

    "taking the effective coulomb potential we obtain the deviation of the eigenvalues from @xmath15-order perturbation theory in @xmath131 shown in table [ tab2 ] for two sets of parameters in the bottonium system ( still neglecting @xmath0 corrections ) .",
    "the deviation of the exact correction from the perturbative estimate is reduced somewhat , especially in the second case , but still far from negligible . in assessing the quality of a perturbative evaluation in this case",
    ", one should also keep in mind that the scale parameter @xmath147 of ref.@xcite was chosen in such a way that the @xmath15 order correction in @xmath131 is precisely canceled by the correction terms to the effective coulomb potential in ( [ coulcorr ] ) . for the first set of parameters this cancellation occurs for the ground state energy .",
    "the second set was chosen so that the splitting between the first excited state and the ground state is not affected to @xmath1 order .",
    "this is obviously a quite arbitrary procedure which requires an additional parameter and furthermore does not cure the problem that perturbation theory simply does not apply ( as table [ tab2 ] clearly indicates ) .",
    "we therefore will not include these modifications to the coulomb force in our discussion of the numerical solution to the full set of coupled equations ( [ diffeq ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 potential terms lifts the degeneracy of pseudoscalar- and vector- quarkonia and we restrict our discussion here to the pseudoscalar case .    the @xmath134-states now couple in , but generally have small ( negative ) norms , because the coupling is of order @xmath0 .",
    "we nevertheless solved the full set of coupled equations numerically , although a perturbative treatment of the @xmath134-state admixture would probably have been sufficient .",
    "the eigenvalues we obtained are summarized in table [ tab3 ] and compared to those obtained by eichten et al.@xcite with the phenomenological funnel potential .",
    "note that we only found 3 or 4 stable solutions in the charmonium and bottonium systems respectively .",
    "we used the same values for the quark masses and the coupling constant as eichten et al.@xcite.the constant @xmath101 was chosen to reproduce the experimental splitting ( not confirmed@xcite ) between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "it was not adjusted in the bottonium system .",
    "the gluon condensate value @xmath148 we used is within qcd - sumrule estimates@xcite for this nonperturbative quantity .",
    "all eigenvalues were finally shifted by @xmath149 to give the correct @xmath138 mass .",
    "( this small shift in the overall energy normalization can be eliminated by a slight change of @xmath150 in the quark masses used by eichten et al.@xcite and a corresponding small adjustment of the other parameters . to have a more direct comparison of the wavefunctions and spectra",
    ", we refrained from making these adjustments here . )    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we show the eigenfunctions for the various components of our quarkonium states ( [ meson ] ) as well as the corresponding eigenfunction of eichten et al.@xcite .",
    "the singlet component of our ground state wave functions are very similar to those of the funnel potential . at small radii",
    "this is true also for the excited states , since the coupling to `` octet '' components is proportional to @xmath112 in ( [ diffeq ] ) .",
    "the `` octet''-components increase with increasing excitation energy of the quarkonium and lead to the appearance of extra nodes in the higher lying `` singlet '' wave functions at large radii ( since this is a coupled channel problem , the extra nodes do not mean that we missed some bound states ) . as noted earlier , the @xmath107-components of the meson state contribute negatively to its norm .",
    "all the stable quarkonia states we found are however positive norm states .",
    "we could not obtain any stable state where the octet components are dominant .",
    "let us speculate at this point on the fact that only very few stable quarkonium states were found .",
    "this is of course quite in line with the experimental observation that only a few heavy quarkonia are stable against decay by strong interactions . for reasons which we had not anticipated",
    ", this basic property seems already to be incorporated in the nonhermitian coupling to @xmath107-components .",
    "the strength of this coupling in our model is however determined by the gluon condensate @xmath36 , which is not expected to vanish even in the purely gluonic theory . from table [ tab3 ]",
    "we see that the instability sets in at an excitation energy of between @xmath151 in this model . since we can not account for the decay into light @xmath152-mesons with a parameter which is essentially independent of the number of ( light )",
    "flavours , we speculate that the nonhermitian coupling proportional to @xmath131 effectively accounts for the possible decay channel @xmath153 in this model . from the fact that we do not seem to find any stable quarkonium states more than @xmath154 above the ground state , we would estimate this to be the threshold for the production of the lightest gluonium .",
    "this estimate of the lightest gluonium mass @xmath155 , is in almost perfect agreement with our previous interpretation of the energy shift @xmath156 .    since the production of light @xmath152-pairs has a much lower threshold , it is this process which limits the stability of physical quarkonia .",
    "we therefore expect this model , which does not ( not even effectively ) incorporate this decay channel , to still predict more stable states than are experimentally observed .",
    "we developed a hamiltonian formalism , which enabled us to estimate the effect of a nonperturbative gluonic ground state on quarkonia in a systematic short distance , weak coupling and @xmath0 expansion of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the gauge invariant basis@xcite was extended to include color octet quark - antiquark pairs coupled to vacuum fluctuations .",
    "hamiltonian matrix elements in this basis are gauge invariant to the order in the short distance expansion we considered .    after separating hard and soft gluons in the gauge ( [ separ ] )",
    ", we obtained the effective hamiltonian neglecting radiative corrections to the coulomb interaction from hard gluons .",
    "we thus neglected the logarithmic corrections to the effective coupling strength at very short distances .",
    "the correct behaviour of the potential for @xmath157 can in principle be included by `` hand '' in a modification of the coulomb part of the interaction@xcite .",
    "although the quarkonium spectrum is not very sensitive to this correction at small distances , it could become important for the evaluation of decay widths , which depend on the wave function at the origin .    in the limit of very heavy quark masses , where all terms of order @xmath0 can be neglected ,",
    "an energy independent effective potential was obtained , which shows an approximately linear behaviour at intermediate distances @xmath158 with an effective string tension of @xmath159 . in our approach this behaviour of",
    "the potential arises due to the nonperturbative structure of the gluonic vacuum parametrized by its gluon condensate and was not assumed from the outset as in most phenomenological quark models .",
    "this potential compares favourably with recent lattice results@xcite , the discrepancies at very small @xmath160 being due to our neglect of radiative corrections .",
    "surprisingly , our potential is almost exactly reproduced by an instantaneous interaction derived from the effective gluon exchange proposed by gribov@xcite .",
    "our short distance expansion for the effective potential however is only valid for @xmath161 , beyond which the potential aquires an imaginary part .",
    "an extension of the model to larger distances would require a more detailed knowledge of the vacuum structure in the form of higher dimensional condensates , or some other effective parametrization of this structure .",
    "the approach in this case would become increasingly phenomenological and also more complicated in this case .",
    "its predictive power is therefore probably limited to heavy quarkonia , where a detailed knowledge of the potential for very large radii does not seem necessary .",
    "we showed that the numerical solution of the coupled channel problem for vector- and pseudoscalar- quarkonia ( they are degenerate to order @xmath0 ) is feasible and an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the extended basis therefore possible .",
    "the resulting exact spectrum does not show the far too rapid increase of the eigenvalues with the principal quantum number of the perturbative approach to the vacuum effects@xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition to the usual `` singlet '' wave - functions describing the quark and anti - quark of the quarkonium when they are coupled in a colour singlet , we also obtain the `` octet '' components of quarkonium states describing the quarks in the octet configuration when an additional ( soft ) gluon is around .",
    "since hadronic decays mainly proceed from this `` octet '' configuration with the creation of an additional octett @xmath152-pair from a hard gluon , this approach opens the possibility of estimating nonperturbative contributions to hadronic decays .",
    "we compare our results for the spectrum and wavefunctions with those of the cornell potential@xcite for pseudoscalar quarkonia in order @xmath0 . with the standard value for the gluon condensate and quark masses and coupling constant used by the cornell group",
    "we obtain the correct splitting between @xmath138 and @xmath139 and make predictions for the @xmath162 s .",
    "our main concern was however a better theoretical understanding and justification of the phenomenological ingredients common to most nonrelativistic models for heavy quarkonia and we refrained from adjusting the few parameters of this approach to optimally reproduce the experimental data .",
    "a better description of the potential at short distances with the inclusion of radiative corrections to the coulomb force and the consideration of hadronic decay channels is clearly desireable before a detailed comparison with phenomenology is attempted .",
