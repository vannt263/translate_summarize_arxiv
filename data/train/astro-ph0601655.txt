    "these impact parameters are even smaller . applying these findings to the dla population , millimeter",
    "co observers need to select those dlas that arise within 2.5 kpc of the centers of galaxies to have a 50% probability of identifying an absorption line corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "none of the _ identified _ dla host galaxies have such small impact parameters , except perhaps two cases studied by @xcite for which only upper limits to the impact parameters could be given due to blending with the background quasar light",

    "[ impact.fig],width=321 ]    our conclusions are qualitatively supported by observations of redshifted molecular lines . to date , only four redshifted molecular absorbers have been identified ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , two of which arise in gravitationally lensed intervening galaxies and two originate in the galaxy that also hosts the radio source against which the absorption is seen . in all cases",
    "the sightline through the high h@xmath0  column passes through the galaxies at small impact parameters .",
    "these cross - section arguments already explain the very low detection rate of molecules in dlas , but there are additional effects that hinder the detection of molecules . molecular hydrogen forms on the surface of dust grains . the regions in galaxies containing most of the universe s h@xmath0  molecules are therefore likely to be dusty , causing a higher optical extinction of the background sources , which , in turn , might lead to them dropping out of magnitude - limited surveys .",
    "obviously , radio - selected quasars do not suffer from this bias and are potentially good candidates against which to find high  absorbers .",
    "however , @xmath76 is so low that identifying such an absorber is highly unlikely in current radio - selected quasars samples .",
    "for example , the redshift interval covered by the corals survey @xcite of radio - loud quasars is only @xmath77 for ly@xmath11 , corresponding to @xmath78 for h@xmath0 .",
    "the redshift interval required for identifying a high   absorber should be on the order of @xmath79 at @xmath2 , or approximately 600 at @xmath80 , taking into account the cosmological variation of the absorption distance interval @xmath81 .",
    "using this method to obtain sufficient statistics to measure the molecular mass density at intermediate and high redshifts , would require radio source samples larger than currently available .",
    "finally , we address the question whether there might exist a significant amount of h@xmath0  gas not associated with dlas .",
    "co mapping of nearby galaxies has shown that many galaxies show a depression in the hi  distribution where the h@xmath0  column densities are highest ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . presumably , in regions where the molecular densities are highest ,",
    "most of the hi  has been converted to h@xmath0 .",
    "we use the hi  and co maps of seven nearby galaxies studied by @xcite to test how much h@xmath0  exists below the hi  dla limit .",
    "we compare the hi  and co maps smoothed to the same spatial resolution of @xmath82 to @xmath83 , and find that the mass fraction of h@xmath0  in regions where @xmath84 ranges from 0 to 40% .",
    "averaged over all pixels from the total sample , this fraction is 6% . in many cases the fraction",
    "is underestimated because the highest  is smoothed over larger regions .",
    "of course , this small sample may not be representative of the total galaxy population at @xmath2 , but at least this exercise shows that a small fraction of the cosmic h@xmath0  density must be found in sub - dlas .",
    "one might identify such absorbers by searching for a sub - dlas with abnormally high metallicities , i.e.  this could indicate absorbers where the hydrogen is not predominantly atomic .",
    "an example of a high metallicity sub - dla has recently been found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently estimated the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) in dla systems by applying the ` schmidt law ' of star formation to the hi  column density distribution function .",
    "the schmidt law is defined in local galaxies and states that the star formation rate correlates very well with total neutral gas surface density @xmath85 to the power 1.4 , as was demonstrated by @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to investigate whether the sfrd measurements based on hi  alone give meaningful results , or whether h@xmath0  should be taken into account for a reliable sfrd measurement .",
    "since presently we only know  at @xmath2 , we can not improve the measurements of @xcite at high redshift by including h@xmath0 .",
    "our aim is simply to test the validity of the method and discuss the implications of including molecules .",
    "we start with estimating what fraction of the sfrd is actually contributed by those regions where the h@xmath0  column is higher than the hi  column . to this end , we make use of equation 4 from @xcite that relates the sfrd to the , and apply it to our measurement of @xmath1 , and  from @xcite .",
    "we make one important modification in that we convert our @xmath2 gas densities to those that would be observed if the gas disks were observed ` face - on ' , assuming that the hi  and h@xmath0  layers are optically thin . at @xmath2",
    "the  is a result of a randomly oriented population of galaxies and it is easy to see that the highest column densities are mostly the result of highly inclined disks .",
    "however , the schmidt law is valid for face - on gas densities .",
    "de - projecting the disk implies that the surface area increases but the column densities decrease .",
    "the net result is that that the  as it is normally defined will overestimate the sfrd . at @xmath2 ,",
    "we find that the sfrd is overestimated by @xmath86% if the regular  is used , instead of the de - projected  for face - on disks .",
    "the de - projected  follows a nearly exponential behaviour between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and can be fitted with the simple equation @xmath89 .",
    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ sfrd_n.fig ] , which shows the implied sfrd as a function of hi  and h@xmath0  face - on column density .",
    "we see that the hi  and h@xmath0  column densities contribute approximately equally to the total sfrd .",
    "the other conclusion from this exercise is that the total derived sfrd at @xmath2 is much higher than that derived from h@xmath11 and [ oii ] measurements [ @xmath90 , @xcite ] .",
    "this contradicts the findings of @xcite who conclude that at @xmath2 the sfrd  derived from the schmidt law and the measured  agrees well with the direct measurements .",
    "the origin of this contradiction is that @xcite used the  measurements of @xcite , which were later corrected upwards with a factor 3 .",
    "if we use the corrected values @xcite or the measurement from @xcite , we find that @xmath91 , a factor two higher than the median of the directly measured values at @xmath2 . using the more realistic face - on , and including both hi  and h@xmath0  in the analysis , we find that @xmath92 , also higher than the nominal value at @xmath2 .",
    "based on the face - on  only , we find @xmath93 , in good agreement with the direct measurements ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    column density as derived from the @xcite star formation law .",

    "[ sfrd_n.fig],width=321 ]    why is the value of  at @xmath2 overestimated by a factor @xmath94 when derived using the  and the schmidt law ?",
    "the answer lies in the fact that the schmidt law is defined for the ` star - forming disks ' , and not for the regions of the hi  layer outside this area .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that star formation only occurs when the gas density exceeds the critical threshold density , which depends on the velocity dispersion of the gas and the galaxy s rotation curve shape and amplitude . from",
    "the  alone it is impossible to determine what the critical threshold gas density is , because this density varies between galaxies and within galaxies .",
    "therefore , applying the schmidt law to all regions in the local universe where the  exceeds @xmath95 will grossly overestimate .",
    "[ as an extreme example , consider ngc 2915 , @xcite where the hi disk is many times larger than the optical disk . ]",
    "furthermore , within galaxies the areas with the highest sfrs are often mostly molecular , and in some cases  declines in regions of high sfr @xcite . in regions",
    "where @xmath96 the critical density is typically exceeded .",
    "consequently , for the purpose of estimating , the  is probably a more reliable estimator , whereas  only gives an upper limit to that fraction of  contributed by regions that are mostly atomic .    in our analysis",
    "we treat the hi  and h@xmath0  independently .",
    "ideally , we would use hi  and h@xmath0  measurements from the same large galaxy sample , but unfortunately such a sample is not available .",
    "our analysis probably slightly _ under_estimates the total sfrd : in regions where the hi  and h@xmath0  columns are equal , the sfr would be @xmath97 times higher if it were derived from the summed gas density instead of from the individual densities . in most regions , where the two column densities are different",
    ", the sfr is underestimated by a much smaller fraction if the hi  and h@xmath0  are treated independently .    in summary",
    ", we have shown here that  can not be used to derive a meaningful sfrd at @xmath2 and therefore probably also not at higher redshifts . only in the unlikely situation that dla galaxies were truly molecule free , the  method would give a meaningful upper limit to the sfrd contributed by dlas .",

    "this is clearly at odds with the observations , unless one is willing to assume that the systems holding the bulk of the neutral gas account for only a small fraction of the cosmic sfrd .",
    "furthermore , even at @xmath2 the sfrd is dominated by regions where  exceeds  ( see also * ? ? ?",
