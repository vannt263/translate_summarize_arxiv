    "it is currently a matter of speculation the actual occurrence of quark matter during protoneutron star ( pns ) evolution .",
    "the standard scenario for the birth of neutron stars indicates that these objects are formed as consequence of the gravitational collapse and supernova explosion of a massive star @xcite .",
    "initially , pnss are very hot and lepton - rich objects , where neutrinos are temporarily trapped . during the first tens of seconds of evolution the pns evolves to form a cold catalyzed neutron star @xcite . as neutrinos",
    "are radiated , the lepton - per - baryon content of matter goes down and the neutrino chemical potential tends to essentially zero in @xmath1 seconds @xcite .",
    "deleptonization is fundamental for quark matter formation inside neutron stars , since it has been shown that the presence of trapped neutrinos in hadronic matter strongly disfavors the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "in fact , neutrino trapping makes the density for the deconfinement transition to be higher than in the case of neutrino - free hadronic matter . as a consequence",
    ", the transition could be delayed several seconds after the bounce of the stellar core .",
    "however , the calculations presented in @xcite were performed employing the mit bag model for the description of quark matter and did not include the effect of color superconductivity .",
    "as we shall see in the present work , the use of the nambu - jona - lasinio model and the inclusion of color superconductivity may change qualitatively the effect of neutrino trapping in the deconfinement conditions .    as emphasized in earlier works",
    "@xcite , an important characteristic of the deconfinement transition in neutron stars , is that just deconfined quark matter is transitorily out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions .",
    "in fact , depending on the temperature , the transition should begin with the quantum or thermal nucleation of a small quark - matter drop near the center of the star . on the other hand",
    ", the flavor composition of hadronic matter in @xmath2-equilibrium is different from that of a @xmath2-stable quark - matter drop . roughly speaking , the direct formation of a @xmath2-stable quark - drop with @xmath3 quarks will need the almost simultaneous conversion of @xmath4 up and down quarks into strange quarks , a process which is strongly suppressed with respect to the formation of a non @xmath2-stable drop by a factor @xmath5 . for typical values of the critical - size @xmath2-stable drop ( @xmath6 @xcite )",
    "the suppression factor is actually tiny .",
    "thus , quark flavor must be conserved during the deconfinement transition @xcite . when color superconductivity is included together with flavor conservation ,",
    "the most likely configuration of the just deconfined phase is 2sc provided the pairing gap is large enough @xcite .",
    "the relevance of this 2sc intermediate phase ( a kind of activation barrier ) has been analyzed for deleptonized neutron stars @xcite but not for hot and lepton - rich objects like pnss .    in the present paper",
    "we shall analyze the deconfinement transition in protoneutron star conditions employing the nambu - jona - lasinio model in the description of quark matter .",
    "for the hadronic phase we shall use a model based on a relativistic lagrangian of hadrons interacting via the exchange of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 mesons @xcite . for simplicity , the analysis will be made in bulk , i.e. without taking into account the energy cost due to finite size effects in creating a drop of deconfined quark matter in the hadronic environment .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the main aspects of the non  linear walecka model describing the hadronic phase . in sec .",
    "iii we present the generalities of the model we use for the quark phase . in sec .",
    "iv we show our numerical results and finally in sec .",
    "v we discuss our results and present the conclusions .",
    "for the hadronic phase we shall use a non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) @xcite which includes the whole baryon octet , electrons and electron neutrinos in equilibrium under weak interactions .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is given by @xmath10 where the indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to baryons , mesons and leptons respectively . for the baryons we have @xmath14\\psi_b,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the contribution of the mesons @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 is given by @xmath23 where the coupling constants are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the ratios @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are equal to @xmath30 for the nucleons and acquire different values for the other baryons depending on the parametrization ( see table i ) .",
    "the leptonic sector is included as a free fermi gas of electrons and electron neutrinos in chemical equilibrium with the other particles .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to derive a quark matter eos from the above formulae it is necessary to impose a suitable number of conditions on the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "three of these conditions are consequences from the fact that the thermodynamically consistent solutions correspond to the stationary points of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath7 , @xmath34 , and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath35    to obtain the remaining conditions one must specify the physical situation in which one is interested in . as in previous works @xcite , we are dealing here with just deconfined quark matter that is temporarily out of chemical equilibrium under weak interactions .",
    "the appropriate condition in this case is flavor conservation between hadronic and deconfined quark matter .",
    "this can be written as @xmath36 being @xmath37 and @xmath38 the abundances of each particle in the hadron and quark phase respectively .",
    "in other words , the just deconfined quark phase must have the same `` flavor '' composition than the @xmath2-stable hadronic phase from which it has been originated .",
    "notice that , since the hadronic phase is assumed to be electrically neutral , flavor conservation ensures automatically the charge neutrality of the just deconfined quark phase .",
    "the conditions given in eq .",
    "( [ flavor ] ) can be combined to obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the particle number density of the @xmath41-species in the quark phase .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are functions of the pressure and temperature , and they characterize the composition of the hadronic phase",
    ". these expressions are valid for _ any _ hadronic eos . for hadronic matter containing @xmath45 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath46 additionally , the deconfined phase must be locally colorless ; thus it must be composed by an equal number of red , green and blue quarks @xmath47 also , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 pairing will happen provided that @xmath52 is nonzero , leading to @xmath53    in order to have all fermi levels at the same value , we consider @xcite @xmath54 these two equations , together with eqs .",
    "( [ colorless ] ) and ( [ pairing ] ) imply that @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .    finally , including the conditions eqs.([gapeq ] ) we have 13 equations involving the 14 unknowns ( @xmath7 , @xmath34 , @xmath52 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) . for given value of one of the chemical potentials ( e.g. @xmath60 ) , the set of equations can be solved once the values of the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the temperature @xmath64 are given . instead of @xmath60",
    ", we can provide a value of the gibbs free energy per baryon @xmath65 or the pressure @xmath66 and solve simultaneously eqs .",

    "( [ gapeq ] ) in order to obtain @xmath7 , @xmath34 , @xmath52 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in order to determine the transition conditions , we apply the gibbs criteria , i.e. we assume that deconfinement will occur when the pressure and gibbs energy per baryon are the same for both hadronic matter and quark matter at a given common temperature .",
    "thus , we have @xmath67 where the index @xmath68 refers to hadron matter and the index @xmath69 to quark matter . according to these conditions ( together with the equations of sections 2 and 3 ) , for a given temperature @xmath70 and neutrino chemical potential of the trapped neutrinos in the hadronic phase @xmath71",
    ", there is an unique pressure @xmath66 at which the deconfinement is possible . instead of @xmath66",
    ", we may characterize the transition point by giving the gibbs free energy per baryon @xmath72 , or alternatively , the mass - energy density of the hadronic phase @xmath73 ( see figs . 1 - 3 ) . we emphasize that , according to the present description , @xmath66 and @xmath72 are the same in both the hadronic phase and the just deconfined phase . however , the mass - energy density @xmath73 and @xmath74 at the transition point are different in general . similarly , while the abundance @xmath75 of neutrinos is the same in both the hadronic and just deconfined quark phases , the chemical potentials @xmath76 and @xmath71 are different .",
    "according to numerical simulations @xcite , during the first tens of seconds of evolution the protoneutron star cools from @xmath77 mev to temperatures below 2 - 4 mev . in the same period ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath71 of the trapped neutrinos evolves from @xmath78 mev to essentially zero .",
    "thus , in order to consider typical pns conditions we have solved eqs .",
    "( [ gibbs ] ) together with the equations of sections 2 and 3 for temperatures in the range @xmath79 mev and @xmath71 in the range @xmath80 mev .",
    "the results are displayed in figs . 1 - 3 for all the parameterizations of the equations of state given in previous sections .            in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the results for the gm1 parametrization of the hadronic eos . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the gibbs free energy density per baryon @xmath72 at which deconfinement occurs versus the temperature @xmath64 for three different values of the neutrino chemical potential in the hadronic phase ( @xmath81 mev ) . in the right panel the same results are shown but as a function of the mass - energy density of the hadronic phase ( in units of the nuclear saturation density @xmath82 g @xmath83 ) . in both figures ,",
    "if the thermodynamic state of hadronic matter ( characterized e.g. by @xmath70 , @xmath73 and @xmath71 ) lies to the left of the curve corresponding to the same @xmath71 , then the deconfinement transition is not possible . in the right side region of a given curve",
    "the preferred phase is deconfined quark matter .",
    "notice that the transition s gibbs free energy is an increasing function of @xmath71 .",
    "however , the transition density of the hadronic phase slightly decreases as @xmath71 increases . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display the results for the gm4 parametrization of the hadronic eos .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same but the transition densities are smaller than those for gm1 by @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the behavior of the transition s density as a function of the chemical potential of trapped neutrinos @xmath71 for two specific temperatures ( @xmath85 2 and 30 mev ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that for a fixed temperature the effect of deleptonization is to inhibit the transition .",
    "this effect is not very large ; at fixed temperature there is a slight increase by less than a 10% when @xmath71 falls from 200 mev to 0 mev . on the other hand , the effect of cooling works in the opposite direction because pairing tends to help the transition and the gap increases as the temperature goes down .",
    "the effect of cooling is also small ; at fixed @xmath71 there is a slight decrease of the transition density @xmath73 by less than a 10% when the temperature falls from 30 mev to 2 mev .",
    "both effects tend to cancel each other as the pns cools and deleptonizes , resulting a transition density that is roughly constant along the evolution of the protoneutron star .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the role of color superconductivity in the deconfinement transition from hadronic matter to quark matter at finite temperature and in the presence of a trapped neutrino gas .",
    "the study presented here is relevant for the first tens of seconds of evolution of newly born protoneutron stars .    in our analysis",
    "we used a two phase description where we employed the nambu - jona - lasinio model in the description of quark matter ( sec .",
    "iii ) and a non - linear walecka model which includes the whole baryon octet , electrons and electron neutrinos in equilibrium under weak interactions in the description of hadronic matter ( sec .",
    "deconfinement is assumed to be a first order phase transition and the just deconfined quark phase is assumed to have the same `` flavor composition '' than the @xmath2-stable hadronic phase from which it has been originated ( see @xcite and references therein ) . when color superconductivity is included together with flavor conservation @xcite ,",
    "the most likely configuration of the just deconfined phase is 2sc provided the pairing gap is large enough .",
    "this just deconfined phase is out of chemical equilibrium under weak interactions and thus it is very short lived but it is a a kind of `` activation barrier '' that determines the onset of the deconfinement transition .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that , within the njl model , deconfinement is more difficult for small neutrino content and it is easier for lower temperatures .",
    "this effect is not very large , at least for the here - used parameterizations of the njl model . at fixed temperature",
    "there is a slight increase by less than a 10% when @xmath71 falls from 200 mev to 0 mev ( see fig .",
    "the effect of cooling is also small ; at fixed @xmath71 there is a slight decrease of the transition density @xmath73 by less than a 10% when the temperature falls from 30 mev to 2 mev ( see fig .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pairing gap becomes larger as the temperature decreases and therefore the increase of the condensation term favors the transition at low temperatures .",
    "both effects tend to cancel each other as the pns cools and deleptonizes , resulting a transition density that is roughly constant along the evolution of the protoneutron star .",
    "the here - found behavior is qualitatively opposite to what it was found within the mit bag model .",
    "in fact , previous analysis without including the effect of color superconductivity @xcite show that the presence trapped neutrinos pushes up the transition density to values much larger than for neutrino free matter .",
    "it was also found in @xcite that the transition is easier for larger temperatures .",
    "more recent results including the effect of color superconductivity within the mit bag model @xcite show that the transition density increases with neutrino trapping but ( in coincidence with the here found results ) the pairing gap favors the transition as the temperature decreases .    in spite of some differences between the results within the njl and the mit bag model description of quark matter some general conclusions",
    "may be obtained about the effect of color superconductivity in the deconfinement transition .",
    "first , when color superconductivity is present the deconfinement density is not so strongly affected by neutrino trapping as it is in the unpaired case .",
    "second , color superconductivity makes the transition easier at lower temperatures and the dependence of the deconfinement density with @xmath64 is much smaller than in the unpaired case .    during cooling and deleptonization of the protoneutron star the temperature and the chemical potential of trapped neutrinos",
    "fall abruptly in a few seconds and there is also some contraction of the whole neutron star .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the density increase is not too large , it may be comparatively important for the deconfinement transition because the effects of temperature and neutrino trapping are smoothed by color superconductivity . according to our results",
    "the deconfinement transition is favored after substantial cooling and contraction of the protoneutron star but full numerical simulations of protoneutron star evolution are needed in order to determine whether and when the deconfinement conditions are attained .",
