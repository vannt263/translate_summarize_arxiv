    "this article is concerned with the inverse spectral problem for metrics of revolution on @xmath0 .",
    "we will assume that our metrics are real analytic and belong to a class @xmath1 of rotationally invariant metrics which are of ` simple type ' and which satisfy some generic non - degeneracy conditions ( see definition ( 0.1 ) ) .",
    "in particular , we will assume they satisfy the generalized ` simple length spectrum ' condition that the length functional on the loop space is a clean bott - morse function which takes on distinct values on distinct components of its critical set ( up to orientation ) .",
    "denoting by @xmath2 the spectrum of the laplacian @xmath3 , our main result is the following :    * theorem i *  _ spec : @xmath4 is 1 - 1 . _    thus , if @xmath5 are isospectral surfaces of revolution in @xmath1 , then @xmath6 is isometric to @xmath7",
    ". it would be very desirable to strengthen this result by removing the assumption that @xmath8 , thereby showing that metrics in @xmath1 are spectrally determined within the entire class of analytic metrics on @xmath0 with simple length spectra .",
    "the only metric on @xmath0 presently known to be spectrally determined in this sense is the standard one ( which is known to be spectrally determined among all @xmath9 metrics ) .",
    "a metric @xmath7 satisfying @xmath10 for some @xmath11 must have many properties in common with a surface of revolution of simple type ; it would be interesting to explore whether it must necessarily be one .",
    "let us now be more precise about the hypotheses .",
    "first , we will assume that there is an effective action of @xmath12 by isometries of @xmath13 .",
    "the two fixed points will be denoted @xmath14 and @xmath15 will denote geodesic polar coordinates centered at @xmath16 , with @xmath17 some fixed meridian @xmath18 from @xmath16 to @xmath19 .",
    "the metric may then be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 \\rightarrow { { \\rm i\\!r}}^+$ ] is defined by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the length of the distance circle of radius @xmath24 centered at @xmath16 .",
    "for any smooth surface of revolution , the function @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 and two such surfaces @xmath27 @xmath28 are isometric if and only if @xmath29 and @xmath30 or @xmath31 we will then assume that the metrics belong to the following class @xmath32 of _ simple analytic _ surfaces of revolution [ bl ] :    * ( 0.1 ) definition *  _ @xmath32 is the moduli space of metrics of revolution @xmath33 with the properties : + ( i ) @xmath6 ( equivalently @xmath25 ) is real analytic ; + ( ii ) @xmath25 has precisely one non - degenerate critical point @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , corresponding to an ` equatorial geodesic ' @xmath36 ; + ( iii ) the ( non - linear ) poincare map @xmath37 for @xmath36 is of twist type ( cf .  1 ) .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath38 the subset of metrics with ` simple length spectra ' in the sense above . _    regarding ` simple length spectra , ' we recall that the closed geodesics of a surface of revolution come in one - parameter families of a common length , filling out invariant torii @xmath39 for the geodesic flow .",
    "the canonical involution @xmath40 takes @xmath39 to its ` time reversal ' @xmath41 , and takes the closed geodesics of @xmath39 to their reversals on @xmath41 .",
    "a closed geodesic and its reversal have the same length , so the length spectrum is automatically double except for the length @xmath42 of the torus of meridians , which is @xmath43-invariant .",
    "the simple length spectrum hypothesis is that up to time reversal , the common lengths of the closed geodesics on distinct torii are distinct ( cf . definition 1.2.2 ) .",
    "in fact , it would be sufficient for the proof that the length @xmath42 of the ` meridian ' closed geodesics is not the length of closed geodesics on any other torus . in any case , it is not hard to show that @xmath1 is residual in @xmath32 ( cf .",
    "proposition 1.2.4 ) .",
    "the condition ( iii ) actually appears in the proof in the following way : the quadratic coefficient ` @xmath44 ' of the classical birkhoff normal form of the metric @xmath45 at the torus of meridian geodesics must be non - vanishing ( see definition ( 1.4.5 ) for the precise meaning of @xmath46 ) .",
    "this condition is used in proposition ( 4.1.2 ) and corollary ( 4.1.3 ) to evaluate the wave invariants for the meridian torus .    as will be explained further below",
    ", the main purpose of the non - degeneracy and simplicity conditions is to insure that there are global action - angle variables for the geodesic flow .",
    "these conditions rule out several types of surfaces of revolution : first , they rule out zoll surfaces of revolution , which are degenerate in every possible sense .",
    "it is indeed unknown at this time whether real analytic zoll surfaces of revolution are determined by their spectra .",
    "they also rule out ` peanuts of revolution ' ( which have hyperbolic waists ) and other natural rotational surfaces such as liouville torii .    to our knowledge",
    ", the strongest prior result on the inverse spectral problem for surfaces of revolution is that of bruning - heintze [ b.h ] : smooth surfaces of revolution with a mirror symmetry thru the @xmath47 plane are spectrally determined among metrics of this kind .",
    "there are also a number of proofs that a surface of revolution is determined by the joint spectrum of @xmath48 and of @xmath49 , the generator of the rotational symmetry [ kac][b][gur ] .",
    "the method - of - proof of bruning - heintze was based on the observation that the invariant spectrum can be heard from the entire spectrum . hence by separating variables the problem",
    "can be reduced to the inverse spectral problem for 1d even singular sturm - liouville operators , which was solved by gelfand - levitan and marchenko .",
    "our proof of the main theorem is based on different kind of method , and the inverse result presented here is hopefully just one illustration of it .",
    "we begin with the facts that simple surfaces of revolution are completely integrable on both the classical and quantum levels and that the laplacian has a global quantum normal form in terms of action operators .",
    "we then study the trace of the wave group and prove that from its singularity expansion we can reconstruct the global quantum normal form .",
    "finally we show that this normal form determines the metric .",
    "this approach is suggested by the recent inverse result of guillemin [ g.1 ] , which shows that the microlocal normal form of @xmath48 around each non - degenerate elliptic closed geodesic can be determined from the wave invariants ( see also [ z.1,2 ] ) .",
    "however , there is but one non - degenerate closed geodesic on a simple surface of revolution , so the direct application of this inverse result does not take full advantage of the situation .",
    "rather , it is natural to start from the fact that the wave group is completely integrable in the following strong sense : namely , it commutes with an effective action of the torus @xmath50 by fourier integral operators on @xmath51 .",
    "that is , there exist global _",
    "action operators _ @xmath52 and a polyhomogeneous symbol @xmath53 of degree 1 on @xmath54 such that @xmath55 .",
    "this is the global quantum birkhoff normal form alluded to above .",
    "our principal tool is the following inverse result :    * main lemma *   _ the wave trace invariants of @xmath33 with @xmath56 determine the quantum normal form @xmath57 _",
    "this lemma does not actually require that @xmath33 be a surface of revolution , but only that the geodesic flow is toric integrable , i.e. commutes with an effective hamiltonian torus action .",
    "it immediately implies that the principal symbol @xmath58 of @xmath59 is a spectral invariant .",
    "since @xmath58 is essentially a global birkhoff normal form for the metric , the wave invariants determine the symplectic equivalence of the geodesic flow .",
    "thus we have :    * corollary 1 *  _ from the wave trace invariants of @xmath33 with @xmath60 we can determine the symplectic equivalence class of @xmath61 .",
    "_    corollary 1 does not however determine the isometry class of a general @xmath62 : as will be discussed in  1 ( see also [ c.k ] ) , simple surfaces of revolution are not symplectically rigid unless they are mirror symmetric .",
    "otherwise put , recovery of the classical birkhoff normal form only determines the _ even part _ of the metric in the following sense :    * corollary 2 *  _ a metric @xmath63 may be written in the form @xmath64 ^ 2 du^2 + [ sin u]^2 d\\theta^2 $ ] (  1 , [ besse ] ) . from the wave invariants",
    "one can determine the _ even part _ of @xmath65 .",
    "in particular if @xmath6 is mirror symmetric , one can determine @xmath6 among mirror symmetric metrics in @xmath1 from its spectrum .",
    "_    it is interesting to note that symplectic rigidity in the mirror - symmetric case gives a new and self - contained proof of the bruning - heintze result , without the use of marchenko s inverse spectral theorem for singular sturm liouville operators .",
    "although this result is superceded by the theorem , it may have some future relevance to other inverse problems .    to complete the proof of the theorem",
    ", we therefore have to study the subprincipal terms in @xmath53 .",
    "the result is :    * final lemma *  _ from @xmath53 one can determine the isometry class of @xmath6 . _",
    "it is in this last lemma that we use in full that @xmath33 is a surface of revolution rather than just a surface with toric integrable geodesic flow .",
    "we also use in full that @xmath53 is a global quantum normal form rather than a microlocal one at @xmath36 . in subsequent work we will investigate the analogues of the final lemma for the microlocal normal form at @xmath36 , for more general toric integrable metrics and for metrics isospectral to toric integrable ones .    to close this introduction",
    ", we discuss some background and some open problems connected with this work .",
    "the principal motivation for studying the inverse spectral problem for surfaces of revolution is its simplicity .",
    "there are to date very few inverse results which determine a metric from its laplace spectrum within the entire class of metrics , or even within concrete infinite dimensional families .",
    "to our knowledge , only the standard @xmath66 for @xmath67 and flat 2-torii are known to be spectrally determined .",
    "hence it is desirable to have a simple model of how an inverse result might go .",
    "a second motivation is a somewhat loose analogy between surfaces of revolution and planar domains .",
    "namely , in both cases the unknown is a function of one variable ( the profile curve , resp .",
    "the boundary ) which completely determines the first return times and angles of geodesics emanating from a transversal .",
    "that is , paths of billiard trajectories ( broken geodesics ) on a bounded planar domain are determined from collisions with the boundary , while paths of geodesics on surfaces of revolution are determined from collisions with a meridian ( or with the equator ) . in analytic cases , it is plausible that the unknown function may be determined in large part by the spectrum of first return times from the local transversal . in the case of an analytic surface of revolution , this length spectrum determines the corresonding birkhoff normal form and hence by corollary 2 it determines the even part of the profile curve .",
    "similarly , in the case of an analytic plane domain , it is proved in [ cv.2 ] that the even part of the boundary of an analytic domain may be determined from the birkhoff normal form of the billiard map at a bouncing ball orbit .",
    "hence , there is a similarity in the relation between the unknown function and the local classical birkhoff normal forms .",
    "it is interesting to observe in this context that the rigidity result of colin de verdiere [ cv.2 ] is quite analogous to the inverse result of bruning - heintze .    some immediate open problems : first , there is the symplectic conjugacy problem mentioned above .",
    "second , can one relax analyticity to smoothness in the theorem above ?",
    "this is likely to follow from a more intensive analysis of the wave invariants .",
    "third , can one extend it to other ` non - simple ' types of surfaces of revolution ?",
    "the main obstacle is that one will generally not have global action - angle variables or global quantum normal forms .",
    "what about completely integrable systems in higher dimensions ?",
    "finally , we would like to thank d.kosygin for several helpful conversations on this paper , and b.kleiner for giving us up to date information about the status of the conjugacy problem for geodesic flows on surfaces of revolution .",
    "from a geometric ( or dynamical ) point of view , the principal virtue of metrics in @xmath32 is described by the following :    * ( 1.1.1 ) proposition *  _ suppose @xmath6 is a real analytic metric of revolution on @xmath0 such that @xmath25 has precisely one non - degenerate critical point at some @xmath68 then the hamiltonian @xmath69 on @xmath70 is completely integrable and possesses global real analytic action - angle variables .",
    "_    * proof * : the complete integrability of @xmath45 ( i.e. of the geodesic flow ) is classical , and follows from the existence of the clairaut integral @xmath71 . since the poisson bracket @xmath72 , the geodesics are constrained to lie on the level sets of @xmath73 ; and since both @xmath45 and @xmath73 are homogeneous of degree one , the behaviour of the geodesic flow is determined by its restriction to @xmath74 . with the assumption on @xmath25 , the level sets are compact and",
    "the only critical level is that of the equatorial geodesics @xmath75 ( traversed with either orientation ) .",
    "the other level sets are well - known to consist of two - dimensional torii .",
    "( had we allowed the existence of at least two critical points in @xmath25 , there would exist a saddle level , i.e. an embedded non - compact cylinder ) .",
    "the existence of global action - angle variables follows from the general results of [ d][g.s ] and have been constructed explicitly for simple surfaces of revolution in [ cv.1 ] .",
    "the general formula is as follows : let @xmath76 be the moment map of the hamiltonian @xmath77-action defined by the geodesic flow and by rotation .",
    "the singular set of @xmath78 is the closed conic set @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 is the cone thru the equatorial geodesic ( in either orientation ) .",
    "the image of @xmath80 is the boundary of @xmath81 ; the map @xmath82 is a trivial @xmath83 bundle over the open convex cone @xmath84 ( the interior of @xmath81 ) . for each @xmath85 ,",
    "let @xmath86 denote the homology of the fiber @xmath87 this lattice bundle is trivial since @xmath81 is contractible , so there exists a smoothly varying homology basis @xmath88 which equals the unit cocircle @xmath89 together with the fixed closed meridian @xmath18 when @xmath90 is on the center line @xmath91 .",
    "the action variables are given by [ cv.1 ,  6 ] @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the extremal values of @xmath24 on the annulus @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 the standard projection ) .",
    "on the torus of meridians in @xmath96 , the value of @xmath97 equals @xmath98 and it equals one on the equatorial geodesic .",
    "so extended , @xmath99 are smooth homogeneous functions of degree 1 on @xmath70 , and generate @xmath100-periodic hamilton flows .",
    "it follows that the pair @xmath101 generates a global hamiltonian torus ( @xmath83)-action commuting with the geodesic flow .",
    "the singular set of @xmath102 equals @xmath103 , corresponding to the equatorial geodesics . the map @xmath104 for the torus @xmath105 with @xmath106 and let @xmath107 denote the closure of @xmath108 as a convex cone .",
    "the symplectically dual angle variables @xmath109 then give , by definition , the flow times ( mod @xmath100 ) along the orbits of @xmath110 from a fixed point on @xmath111 , which we may take to be the unique point lying above the intersection of the equator and the fixed meridian on @xmath111 with the geodesic pointing into the northern hemisphere .",
    "so far , we have only assumed the metric to be @xmath9 .",
    "we now observe that if @xmath6 is real analytic , then so are @xmath112 this is obvious in the case of @xmath113 and follows from the explicit formula ( 1.1.3 ) for @xmath114       ' '' ''    since the metric norm function @xmath45 commutes with @xmath99 , it may be expressed as a function @xmath115 of the action variables .",
    "hamilton s equations for the geodesic flow then take the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the _ frequency vector _ of the torus @xmath118 with action coordinates @xmath119 . the geodesic flow on @xmath118 is then given by @xmath120 so that all the geodesics are quasi - periodic in action - angle coordinates .",
    "the frequency vector @xmath121 is homogeneous of degree 0 on @xmath122 , and hence is constant on rays of torii @xmath123 . to break the @xmath124 symmetry we restrict to the level set @xmath125 in action space and view the frequency vector as the map : @xmath126 since @xmath127 the frequency map is more or less the gauss map of @xmath128 ( although it is not normalized to be of unit length ) . as a map of the global action space ,",
    "the frequency map is the legendre transform associated to @xmath129 ( cf .",
    "[ f.g , p.338 ] ) .    *",
    "( 1.1.6 ) definition *  _ we say that the simple surface of revolution @xmath33 is _ globally non - degenerate _ if @xmath130 is an embedding .",
    "_    this is the natural homogeneous analogue of the non - degeneracy condition of [ f.g , loc.cit ] to the effect that the legendre transform be a global diffeomorphism , and has previously been studied in some detail by bleher in the setting of simple surfaces of revolution [ bl,6 ] .",
    "as will be seen in  1.3 , the curve @xmath128 is the graph of a smooth function of the form @xmath131 in the cone @xmath132 and the non - degeneracy condition ( 1.1.6 ) will follow as long as @xmath133 is a convex or concave function .",
    "in fact , in the proof of the theorem we will only need to use that @xmath128 is non - degenerate at the one point @xmath134 this is sufficient because we assume the metric to be real analytic .",
    "[ figure1 ]      we now come to the definition of length spectrum and simple length spectrum for a completely integrable geodesic flow .",
    "we first observe that the orbit thru @xmath135 is periodic of period @xmath136 if and only if @xmath137 for some @xmath138 the minimal positive such @xmath136 will be called the primitive period ; the corresponding @xmath139 is known as the vector of winding numbers of the torus @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath139 parametrizes the homology class of the closed orbit @xmath140 since the latter has the form @xmath141 relative to the homology basis @xmath142 .    due to the homogeneity ,",
    "the period and vector of winding numbers are constant on the ray @xmath143 . by euler",
    "s formula we then have @xmath144 hence the length is given in terms of the winding vector by @xmath145 or simply @xmath146 on the unit tangent bundle @xmath147 .",
    "it is clear that the periodicity condition @xmath148 is independent of @xmath149 .",
    "hence , all of the geodesics on @xmath118 are closed if any of them are .",
    "( this also follows , of course , from the transitivity of the torus action on each invariant torus . )",
    "we therefore say :    * ( 1.2.2 ) definition *     _ _",
    "\\(a ) a torus @xmath118 is a _ periodic torus _ if all the geodesics on it are closed .",
    "+ ( b ) the _ period _ @xmath136 of the periodic torus is then the common period of its closed geodesics .",
    "+ ( c ) the _ length spectrum _ @xmath150 of the completely integrable system is the set of these lengths .",
    "+ ( d ) the completely integrable system has a _ simple length spectrum _ if there exist a unique periodic torus ( up to time reversal ) of each length @xmath151 .    in the last statement",
    "( d ) we are referring to the canonical involution @xmath152 , which reverses the orientation of the geodesics .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath118 is a periodic torus of period @xmath136 , then so is @xmath153 .",
    "let @xmath154 denote the set of periodic points for the geodesic flow on @xmath155 , i.e. the set of points which lie on a closed geodesic .",
    "it is a union of periodic torii in @xmath155 together with points along the equatorial geodesics ( which are degenerate torii ) .",
    "the set of all periodic points in @xmath156 is then equal to @xmath157 since the invariant torii are parametrized by the points @xmath158 of action space , it is convenient to parametrize @xmath159 by a subset of the level set @xmath160    * ( 1.2.3 ) definition*_the set of points @xmath161 such that @xmath162 will be called , with a slight abuse of notation , the set of _ periodic _ points on @xmath163 and will be denoted by @xmath164 .",
    "that is , @xmath165 _    the following proposition will be needed later on ( proposition ( 4.1.4 ) .    * ( 1.2.4 ) proposition *  _ if @xmath33 is non - degenerate ( 1.1.6 ) , then @xmath164 is dense in @xmath163 . _    * proof * : let @xmath166 equal the image of @xmath164 under the frequency map @xmath167 . then by definition , @xmath168 ( for ` rational points ' ) is the projection to the curve @xmath169 of the integer lattice in @xmath170 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath168 is a dense set in @xmath169 ; since @xmath167 is an embedding , @xmath164 is dense in @xmath171       ' '' ''    the next proposition shows that our inverse result is valid for a residual set of simple analytic surfaces of revolution .    *",

    "the proposition follows .       ' '' ''      let us consider more carefully the geometric interpretation of the clairaut integral on a torus @xmath180 since @xmath113 and @xmath181 are independent commuting coordinates , and since there are global action - angle variables , the different invariant torii in @xmath96 are parametrized by the values @xmath182 $ ] of the clairaut integral along @xmath163 . indeed by ( 1.1.3 ) , the second action coordinate @xmath97 is determined from @xmath113 on @xmath128 by the formula @xmath183 where @xmath184 are the roots of @xmath185 the torus in @xmath96 with @xmath186 is therefore @xmath187 , which we will denote simply by @xmath188 the projection of @xmath189 to @xmath0 is an annulus of the form @xmath190 .",
    "the geodesics on @xmath191 project to @xmath0 as almost periodic curves oscillating between the two extremal parallels @xmath192 and @xmath193    we observe then that @xmath189 contains a unique geodesic @xmath194 which passes thru the intersection of the reference geodesics @xmath18 and @xmath36 ; @xmath195 equals @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the angle between @xmath194 and @xmath18 . in other words",
    ", @xmath198 is the common angle with which the geodesics on @xmath189 intersect the meridians as they pass thru the equator in the direction of the northern hemisphere . since the length @xmath199 of the equator @xmath36 equals @xmath200 , and since this length is a symplectic invariant of the geodesic flow , the coordinates @xmath195 and @xmath201",
    "are related in an essentially universal fashion .",
    "hence , either @xmath113 or @xmath202 could be used as an action coordinate on @xmath163 ; @xmath201 is perhaps more geometric but @xmath113 is more convenient in calculations .",
    "the picture is the same for any invariant torus @xmath118 : under the @xmath124 action on @xmath203 , it scales to a torus @xmath204 and all features of its geometry are identical to that of @xmath189 .",
    "thus it carries a unique ( parametrized ) geodesic @xmath205 such that @xmath206 is at the intersection @xmath207 , and so that @xmath208 points to the northern hemisphere .",
    "the initial angle variables of @xmath209 are therefore @xmath210 at time @xmath211 we denote the angle variables of @xmath212 by @xmath213 where @xmath214 essentially measures the meridianal angle and @xmath215 measures the equatorial angle .",
