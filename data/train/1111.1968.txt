    "open dielectric resonators have received great attention due to numerous applications @xcite , e.g. , as microlasers @xcite or as sensors @xcite , and as paradigms of open wave - chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "the size of dielectric microcavities typically ranges from a few to several hundreds of wavelengths .",
    "wave - dynamical systems that are large compared to the typical wavelength have been treated successfully with semiclassical methods .",
    "these provide approximate solutions in terms of properties of the corresponding classical system . in the case of dielectric cavities ,",
    "the corresponding classical system is an open dielectric billiard . inside",
    "the billiard rays travel freely while , when impinging the boundary , they are partially reflected and refracted to the outside according to snell s law and the fresnel formulas .",
    "the field distributions of resonance states of dielectric cavities can be localized on the periodic orbits ( pos ) of the corresponding billiard @xcite and the far - field characteristics of microlasers can be predicted from its ray dynamics @xcite .",
    "semiclassical corrections to the ray picture due to the goos - hnchen shift @xcite , fresnel filtering @xcite , and curved boundaries @xcite are under investigation for a more precise understanding of the connections between ray and wave dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the most important tools in semiclassical physics are trace formulas , which relate the density of states of a quantum or wave - dynamical system to the pos of the corresponding classical system @xcite .",
    "recently , a trace formula for two - dimensional ( 2d ) dielectric resonators was developed @xcite .",
    "the trace formula was successfully tested for resonator shapes with regular classical dynamics in experiments with 2d dielectric microwave resonators @xcite and with polymer microlasers of various shapes @xcite .",
    "however , typical microlasers like those used in refs .  @xcite are three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems .",
    "while trace formulas for closed 3d electromagnetic resonators have been derived @xcite and tested @xcite , hitherto there is practically no investigation of the trace formula for 3d dielectric resonators .",
    "the main reason is the difficulty of the numerical solution of the full 3d maxwell equations for real dielectric cavities .",
    "the case of flat microlasers is special since their in - plane extensions are large compared to the typical wavelength , whereas their height is smaller than or of the order of the wavelength . even in this case",
    "complete numerical solutions are rarely performed . in practice ,",
    "flat dielectric cavities are treated as 2d systems by introducing a so - called effective index of refraction @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "this approximation has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite and a good overall agreement between the experiments and the theory was found .",
    "however , it is known @xcite that this 2d approximation ( called the @xmath0 model in the following ) introduces certain uncontrolled errors .",
    "even the separation between transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations intrinsic in this approach is not , strictly speaking , valid for 3d cavities @xcite . to the best of the authors knowledge , no _",
    "a priori _ estimates of such errors are known even when the cavity height is much smaller than the wavelength .",
    "the purpose of the present work is the careful comparison of the experimental length spectra and the trace formula computed within the 2d @xmath0 approximation .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the dispersion of the effective index of refraction on the trace formula is investigated as well as the need for higher - order corrections of the trace formula due to , e.g. , curvature effects .",
    "the experiments were performed with two dielectric microwave resonators of circular shape and different thickness like in ref .",
    "these are known to be ideal testbeds for the investigation of wave - dynamical chaos @xcite and have been used , e.g. , in refs .",
    "the results of these microwave experiments can be directly applied to dielectric microcavities in the optical frequency regime if the ratio of the typical wavelength and the resonator extensions are similar .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the experimental setup and the measured frequency spectrum",
    "are discussed in .",
    "section [ sec : theo ] summarizes the @xmath0 model for flat 3d resonators , the semiclassical trace formula for 2d resonators and how these are combined here .",
    "the experimental length spectra are compared to this model in and concludes with a discussion of the results .",
    "two flat circular disks made of teflon were used as microwave resonators .",
    "the first one , disk a , has a radius of @xmath1 mm and a thickness of @xmath2 mm so @xmath3 .",
    "its index of refraction is @xmath4 .",
    "a typical frequency of @xmath5 ghz corresponds to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wave number and @xmath8 the speed of light .",
    "the second one , disk b , has @xmath9 mm , @xmath10 mm ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ghz corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "the values of the indices of refraction @xmath15 of both disks were measured independently ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and validated by numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "they showed negligible dispersion in the considered frequency range .. ] figure [ sfig : setupphoto ] shows a photograph of the experimental setup .",
    "the circular teflon disk is supported by three pillars arranged in a triangle .",
    "the prevalent modes observed experimentally are whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) that are localized close to the boundary of the disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pillars perturb the resonator only negligibly because their position is far away from the boundary .",
    "additionally , @xmath16 cm of a special foam ( rohacell 31ig by evonik industries @xcite ) with an index of refraction of @xmath17 is placed between the pillars and the disk as isolation [ see ] .",
    "the total height of the pillars is @xmath18 mm so the resonator is not influenced by the optical table .",
    "two vertical wire antennas are placed diametrically at the cylindrical sidewalls of the disk ( cf .",
    "they are connected to a vectorial network analyzer ( pna n5230a by agilent technologies ) with coaxial rf cables .",
    "the network analyzer measures the complex scattering matrix element @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ratio between the powers @xmath21 coupled out via antenna @xmath22 and @xmath23 coupled in via antenna @xmath24 for a given frequency @xmath25 . plotting @xmath26 versus @xmath25 yields the frequency spectrum .",
    "the measured frequency spectrum of disk b  is shown in .",
    "it consists of several series of roughly equidistant resonances .",
    "the associated modes can be labeled with their polarization and the quantum numbers of the circle resonator , which are indicated in . here",
    ", @xmath27 are the azimuthal and radial quantum number , respectively ; tm denotes transverse magnetic polarization with the @xmath28 component of the magnetic field , @xmath29 , equal to zero ; and te denotes transverse electric polarization with the @xmath28 component of the electric field , @xmath30 , equal to zero .",
    "each series of resonances consists of modes with the same polarization and radial quantum number .",
    "the free spectral range ( @xmath31 ) for each series is in the range of @xmath32@xmath33 mhz . only modes with @xmath34 , that is , wgms , are observed in the experiment .",
    "the quantum numbers were determined from the intensity distributions , which were measured with the perturbation body method ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . to determine the polarization of the modes",
    "a metal plate was placed parallel to the resonator at a variable distance @xmath35 [ see ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : polmeas ] shows a part of the frequency spectrum with two resonances for different distances of the metal plate to the disk .",
    "the metal plate induces a shift of the resonance frequencies , where the magnitude of the frequency shift increases with decreasing distance @xmath35 .",
    "notably , the direction of the shift depends on the polarization of the corresponding mode : te modes are shifted to higher frequencies and tm modes to lower ones , so the polarization of each mode can be determined uniquely .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the different boundary conditions for the @xmath30 field ( tm modes ) and the @xmath29 field ( te modes ) at the metal plates .",
    "the former obeys dirichlet , the latter neumann boundary conditions . a detailed explanation is given in appendix [ sec : polmeascalc ] .",
    "the open dielectric resonators are described by the vectorial helmholtz equation @xmath36 \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\vec{e } \\\\ \\vec{b } \\end{array } \\right\\ } = \\vec{0}\\ ] ] with outgoing - wave boundary conditions , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the electric and the magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath39 is the index of refraction at the position @xmath40 .",
    "though all components of the electric and magnetic fields obey the same helmholtz equation , they are not independent but rather coupled in the bulk and at the boundaries as required by the maxwell equations .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath41 of are complex and the real part of @xmath41 corresponds to the resonance frequency @xmath42 of the resonance @xmath43 , while the imaginary part corresponds to the resonance width @xmath44 ( full width at half maximum ) .    for the infinite slab geometry ( see ) ,",
    "the vectorial helmholtz equation can be simplified by separating the wave vector @xmath45 into a vertical @xmath28 component , @xmath46 , and a component parallel to the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , @xmath50 , and the angle of incidence on the top and bottom surface of the resonator is @xmath51 . for a resonant wave inside the slab the wave vector component @xmath52 must obey the resonance condition @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fresnel reflection coefficient .",
    "the solutions of yield the quantized values of @xmath52 .",
    "the effective index of refraction @xmath0 is defined as @xmath55 and corresponds to the phase velocity with respect to the @xmath47-@xmath48 plane . in the experiments only modes trapped due to total internal reflection ( tir ) are observed . in this case , the reflection coefficient @xmath54 can be written as @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 for tm modes and @xmath59 for te modes . with these definitions ,",
    "the quantization condition for @xmath52 can be reformulated as an implicit equation for the determination of @xmath0 , @xmath60\\ ] ] with @xmath61 being the order of excitation in the @xmath28 direction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62 term in corresponds to the fresnel phase due to the reflections and the @xmath63 term to the geometrical phase . in the framework of the @xmath0 model the flat resonator",
    "is treated as a dielectric slab waveguide and the vectorial helmholtz equation [ ] is accordingly reduced to the 2d scalar helmholtz equation @xcite by replacing @xmath15 by the effective index of refraction @xmath0 , @xmath64 where the wave function @xmath65 inside , respectively , outside of the resonator corresponds to @xmath30 in the case of tm modes and to @xmath29 in the case of te modes .",

    "obviously , @xmath0 depends strongly on the frequency , and this dispersion plays a crucial role in the present work .",

    "including curvature corrections in the fresnel coefficients does not suffice for an accurate calculation of the contributions of these pos to @xmath74 .",

    "the relative error @xmath194 is , thus , slightly smaller than in the case of disk a.    since the trace formula itself is exact , the only explanation for these deviations is the systematic error of the @xmath0 model .",
    "therefore , we compare the measured ( @xmath195 ) and the calculated ( @xmath196 ) resonance frequencies for disk a  in .",
    "the resonance frequencies were calculated by solving the 2d helmholtz equation [ ] for the circle as in ref .",
    "the difference between the measured and the calculated frequencies in ( a ) is as large as half a fsr ( i.e. , the distance between two resonances with the same radial quantum number ) and slowly decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "this is in accordance with the result that the fsr of the calculated resonances in ( b ) is slightly larger than that of the measured ones .",
    "since the frequency spectrum consists of series of almost equidistant resonances , the effect of this systematic error on the peak positions in the length spectrum can be estimated by considering a simple 1d system with equidistant resonances whose distance equals @xmath31 .",
    "the peak position in the corresponding length spectrum is @xmath197 , and a deviation of @xmath198 leads to an error , @xmath199 of the peak position . with @xmath200 mhz",
    "compared to @xmath201 mhz we expect a deviation of @xmath202 or @xmath203 mm in the peak positions , which agrees quite well with the magnitude of the deviations found in . for disk b , the comparison between the measured and the calculated fsr ( not shown here ) yields @xmath204 , which also agrees well with the deviations of @xmath194 found in .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the deviations between the peak positions of the experimental length spectrum and that of the trace formula indeed arise from the systematic error of the @xmath0 model .",
    "unfortunately , we know of no general method to estimate the magnitude of this systematic error beforehand .",
    "it should be noted that the exact magnitude of the systematic error contributing to the deviations found in figs .",

    "the positions of the peaks in the experimental length spectrum are , however , slightly shifted with respect to the geometrical lengths of the pos .",
    "we found that this shift is related to two different effects , which are , first , the frequency dependence of the effective index of refraction and , second , a systematic inaccuracy of the @xmath0 approximation . in the examples considered here ,",
    "the former effect is as large as @xmath205 of the po length while the latter effect is as large as @xmath192 of @xmath76 , and the two effects cancel each other in part .",
    "the results and methods presented here provide a refinement of the techniques used in refs .",
    "@xcite and allow for the detailed understanding of the spectra of realistic microcavities and -lasers in terms of the 2d trace formula .",
    "furthermore , many of the effects discussed here also apply to 2d systems made of a dispersive material .",
    "some open problems remain , though .",
    "the comparison of the semiclassical trace formula with the exact one for the circle showed that the former needs to be improved for pos close to the critical angle .",
    "furthermore , there are some deviations between the experimental length spectra and the trace formula predictions due to the systematic error of the effective index of refraction approximation .",
    "its effect on the length spectra proved to be rather small and , thus , allowed for the identification of the different po contributions .",
    "however , the computation of the resonance frequencies of flat 3d resonators based on the combination of the 2d trace formula and the @xmath0 approximation would lead to the same systematic deviations from the measured ones as in ref .",
    "another problem with this systematic error is that its magnitude can not be estimated _ a priori_. the comparison of the results for disk a  and disk b  seems to indicate that it gets smaller for @xmath206 , but there are not enough data to draw final conclusions yet , especially since the value of @xmath207 is of similar magnitude for both disks .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite rather indicates that the systematic error of the @xmath0 model increases with decreasing @xmath207 .",
    "this could be attributed to diffraction effects at the boundary of the disks that become more important when @xmath208 gets smaller compared to the wavelength .",
    "on the other hand , the exact 2d case is recovered for @xmath209 , i.e. , an infinitely long cylinder . in conclusion",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath0 model in the limit @xmath206 remains an open problem .",
    "an analytical approach to the problem of flat dielectric cavities that is more accurate than the @xmath0 model would be of great interest .",
    "another perspective direction is to consider 3d dielectric cavities with the size of all sides having the same order of magnitude and to develop a trace formula for them similar to those for metallic 3d cavities @xcite .",
    "the authors wish to thank c. classen from the department of electrical engineering and computer science of the tu berlin for providing numerical calculations to validate the measured resonance data .",
    "this work was supported by the dfg within the sonderforschungsbereich 634 .",
    "the placement of a metal plate parallel to the dielectric disk influences the effective index of refraction , thus , leading to a shift of the resonance frequencies . in order to determine the change of @xmath0",

    "this qualitative behavior is found for the whole range of @xmath35 , even when is no longer valid .",
