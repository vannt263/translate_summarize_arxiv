    "differences between stellar orbital dynamics and gas dynamics in disk galaxies play a fundamental role in the interpretation ( or misinterpretation ) of kinematics observations in order to deduce general physical properties of galaxies .",
    "one example @xcite is that the inferred quantity of dark matter in galaxies can be affected by inconsistencies between the well - studied gas rotation curve and the relatively poorly studied stellar disc rotation curve .",
    "several observational and theoretical studies have been devoted to the investigation of the relationship between the gas streamlines and the corresponding stellar orbits .",
    "in particular , it is customary to identify the non self - intersecting stable periodic orbits of a given astronomical system , with plausible regions for gas streams to settle ( e.g. @xcite ) .    from resonances",
    "emerge strong orbital families like the x1 type that manage to survive in models up to approximately the 4:1 resonance .",
    "after that periodic orbits from many families are found .",
    "this means that at resonances new families of periodic orbits start existing . at resonances",
    "we may encounter more than one family of periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "this is in part intrinsic to the problem , due to the non - linear character of the perturbations . in normal non - barred spiral galaxies with a moderate non - axisymmetric component , such as spiral arms ,",
    "the stellar orbits and gaseous flow can be highly non - linear ( this means , the response of a dynamical system to a perturbation depends non - linearly on the amplitude of the perturbation ) , even far from resonances .",
    "also , phenomena like gas shocks or stellar chaos are found even in the case of low - amplitude spiral perturbations @xcite .",
    "large scale galactic gaseous and stellar flows present various important differences in their kinematics .",
    "some interesting known differences between the response of gas and stars to an imposed galactic potential model are due to the fact that gas is very responsive and suffers violent shocks , unlike stars . in resonant regions ,",
    "it has been suggested that shocks occur close to the intersections of stable periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "gas is attracted to the spiral arms by their gravitational field and , unlike stars , it responds to pressure gradients . in non -",
    "barred galaxies with large bulges or thick disks ( such as early spirals ) , stars are supported not only by rotation but by strong radial velocities or velocity dispersion , while gas settles down in much thinner disks supported by rotation .",
    "the later the morphological type of the galaxy , the more similar are gas and stellar kinematics @xcite . in this work we study the interplay between gas flow and stellar orbital dynamical properties of spiral galaxies .",
    "we have calculated a set of mhd and particle simulations in a static background gravitational potential based on a full 3d spiral galactic model @xcite .",
    "this includes spiral arms different in nature to the classic tight winding approximation , in order to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between stellar orbits and gas orbits in non - barred spiral galaxies , and the relation with periodic orbits inside and outside resonance regions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] , the galactic potential used to compute the mhd and stellar orbits and the initial simulation set up is described . in  [ sec : orbits ] , the stellar and mhd orbits obtained with the spiral potential are presented and compared with each other . in  [ sec : conclusions ] , we present a brief summary and discussion of our results .",

    "this equilibrium is perturbed by the perlas spiral arm potential , which rotates with a pattern speed of @xmath13 .",
    "this pattern speed and background potential place the inner lindblad , 4:1 , corotation , -4:1 , and outer lindblad resonances at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we solved the mhd equations with the zeus code @xcite , which is a finite difference , time explicit , operator split , eulerian code for ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",

    "fig : simulation ] ) .",
    "the inner pair of arms follows a @xmath19 pitch angle , while the two pairs outside the ilr follow a @xmath19 and @xmath20 pitch angles ; in contrast , the perturbing arm potential follows a @xmath21 pitch .",
    "the exact position and pitch angle of the gaseous spiral arms oscillate slightly around the above quoted values .",
    "it is noticeable the presence of an mhd instability at corotation radius ( further described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which begins to develop @xmath22 after the start of the simulation .",
    "this instability is present in a variety of simulations with different magnetic field intensities , and absent in purely hydrodynamical ones . with exception of this instability , absence of a magnetic field",
    "does not affect our conclusions .",
    "figure  [ fig : densidades ] compares the imposed stellar density with the response gas density at a time @xmath23 after the start of the simulation .",
    "the stellar density is obtained by taking the laplacian of the potentials corresponding to the axisymmetric background disk and spiral arm distribution , as given by the perlas model . in this figure ,",
    "the differences in position and pitch of stellar and gaseous arms are apparent .     after the start of the simulation . since the model corresponds to a trailing spiral , the gas flows down from the top of the plot .",
    "the differences in number and position of the stellar and gaseous arms are apparent . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : junta_orbitas ] shows a comparison of stable periodic stellar and gaseous orbits in the background axisymmetric+spiral galactic potential .",
    "that figure also shows the positions of the major resonances and the locus of the spiral arms as defined in the perlas model .",
    "since zeus is an eulerian code , it does not provide the actual path a gas parcel follows .",
    "therefore , in order to reconstruct a gaseous orbit , we integrated the velocity field interpolating in space and time between data files for an array of initial positions , following the trajectories of individual gas parcels in the resulting velocity field .",
    "the integration was performed over @xmath1 , starting @xmath23 into the simulation in order to avoid the initial settling of the gas into the spiral pattern .",
    "if during that time the gas parcel reaches either of the numerical boundaries ( at @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , we stop the integration .",
    "the stellar orbits were obtained by direct integration in the potential , locating the periodic ones using a newton - raphson algorithm .",
    "when comparing the stellar and gaseous orbits presented in figure  [ fig : junta_orbitas ] , it is apparent that some of them are similar , but also some may be quite different , even when both gas and stars are subjected to the same gravitational potential .    stars and gas follow orbits that are similar in the regions between the resonances . in figure",
    "[ fig : orbits_far_res ] , we show some of the orbits calculated in similar regions ; we also show the stellar mass and gas densities for comparison with the orbit . in the case of the stellar orbits",
    ", it is noticeable how the familiar oval shape ( associated with the ilr ) gradually morphs into a rounded square as the orbit approaches the 4:1 resonance .",
    "these last orbits are less supportive of the spiral pattern , in accordance with analytical theory .",
    "+         +         +                  +         +                    although the gas orbits are complex and quite sensitive to the initial position , they follow a similar evolution to the stars when regions away from the ilr are considered .",
    "it is noticeable that the gaseous orbits develop features that give rise to the second pair of spiral arms ( apparent in the rightmost column of fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_far_res ] ) .",
    "as opposed to the stars , the gas may change direction rapidly by developing oblique shocks , which generate pressure gradients that further change the path of the orbit . between the ilr and 4:1 resonance , the stellar and gaseous orbits are similar in the radial range they span , but",
    "the shape differs when the second pair of gaseous arms becomes stronger , since the shocks at the arm positions significantly change the path of the gas parcel . just outside the 4:1 resonance , at the same jacobi constant , we have more than one main family of periodic orbits coexisting , some of them stable , but the most of them unstable ( see fig .  7 in @xcite ) .",
    "most of stars approach an orbit with a four - fold symmetry ; the gas , on the other hand , selects a twofold symmetric orbit related to the 2:1 coexisting periodic orbits family , associated with the only pair of arms found in the gas in this region .    near the resonances ,",
    "the gas and stars follow quite different orbits ( fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_near_res ] ) .",
    "while the stars follow the familiar geometrical shapes , the gas is unable to follow the large departures from circularity of the stellar orbits .",
    "while the stars follow oval - shaped periodic orbits near the ilr , the gas actually tries to avoid that region .",
    "integrations starting near or inside the ilr decay to the ring / spur structure just inside @xmath26 .",
    "this structure is not expected to appear in real galaxies , since usually it is affected by the starting position of the spiral arms and should be strongly influenced by a galactic bar not included in the present model ) .",
    "in fact , in order to find a gaseous orbit that resembles those found in the stars near the ilr , we must look for an orbit that remains outside the ilr region during its time evolution ( the top row in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_far_res ] , for example ) . also , these gaseous orbits present some dispersion , since they are not quite periodic and actually cross themselves .",
    "this is possible since the simulation does not really reach a steady state , but instead settles on a periodic cycle , with the arms oscillating slightly around given positions .",
    "near the 4:1 resonance , the periodic stellar orbit follows the familiar rounded - square , while the gas actually remains close to a circular orbit , with deviations from circularity of less than @xmath27 ( although these deviations are systematic and allow for one pair of the gaseous spiral arms to extend beyond this resonance , as opposed to the stellar pattern ) .",
    "the strong evolution of the gaseous orbits around the ilr is absent near the 4:1 resonance .",
    "further out , the expected banana - shaped orbits appear at some positions , although the gaseous orbits are greatly distorted due to the turbulence related to the instability at corotation ( fig .  [",
    "fig : orbits_near_corot ] ) .",
    "the strong velocity perturbations related to this instability appear to generate points that act as attractors .",
    "future work will try to determine whether these positions are suitable for star formation .",
    "outside corotation , the gas orbits are nearly circular again , with deviations less than @xmath28 from the initial radius .",
    "this is not surprising since the underlying spiral perturbation is already weak , representing only @xmath29 of the radial axisymmetric force at the -4:1 resonance ( the arm potential tapers - off at a radius of @xmath30 , see @xcite ) .",
    "we performed mhd simulations of a gaseous disk subjected to the perlas spiral potential ( disregarding the effect of a galactic bar , which will be explored in the future ) .",
    "we then studied the actual path the gas follows as it rotates around the galaxy in order to compare it with the stable periodic stellar orbits existing in that same galactic potential in order to test the frequently stated assumption that the gas should follow orbits close to the periodic stellar orbits that do not cross themselves .",
    "we found that the gas does not always behave that way .",
    "the most obvious difference in the stellar and gas behaviour is that the gas responds to the two - arm potential with four spiral arms @xcite , organized in two pairs , each with a tighter pitch angle than the underlying potential .",
    "the four gaseous arms are well defined between the ilr and the 4:1 resonance , more or less straddling the stellar arms in similar fashion to the secondary compressions described by @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : densidades ] ) . outside the 4:1 resonance ,",
    "the gaseous arms follow the stellar arms more closely .",
    "the gas response to stellar arms depend on the details of the imposed potential ( compare , for example , with @xcite and @xcite ) and will be explored in future work .",
    "as opposed to stars , the gas may develop shocks at the arm positions , which allow its orbits ( understood as the path a gas parcel follows ) to change direction abruptly .",
    "this behaviour generates cusps in the gaseous orbits that are not present in the stellar orbits .",
    "setting aside the extra cusps in the gaseous orbits , the stellar and gaseous orbits are most similar in between the resonances , when the general shape and radial range are considered .",
    "these are the regions where the periodic stellar orbits are rounder and the radial excursions are smaller , allowing the gas to more closely follow the stellar orbits since it will be less influenced by forces other than gravity . near the resonances , however , the stars suffer large radial excursions that imply regions with small curvature radii so that the orbit may close on itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_near_res ] ) .",
    "a gas parcel can not follow such an orbit , above which gas can not settle down readily on the orbit because of the presence of strong shocks at the apocenter . ] and either looses angular momentum and moves away from the resonance ( such as the orbit near the ilr ) , or settles in an orbit with only small radial excursions . the gravitational forcing that maintains the resonance is still present",
    "; so , even as the gas follows a nearly circular orbit , its velocity is not uniform , thus generating pressure waves that allow the spiral arm to extend across the resonant radius ; this is apparent , for example , across the 4:1 resonance .",
    "although banana - type orbits should be present at the corotation radius , the gas only develops such orbits just beyond that resonance . generally speaking , the gas experiences changes always in the outer side of the resonant radii , for example , the second pair of arms start and end just outside the ilr and 4:1 resonance , respectively",
    "this particular element will be further explored in future work .",
    "when stating that the gas should follow stable periodic stellar orbits that do not cross , a key assumption is that the gas falls into a steady state .",
    "small oscillations of the gaseous arms ( an effect exacerbated when the vertical structure of the gaseous disk is considered , see @xcite ) and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities ( like that present at corotation , see @xcite ) , distort the gaseous orbits so that they may cross themselves .",
    "other phenomena not considered here , like star formation and feedback , will further disrupt the path a gas parcel should follow .    on the other hand , in chaotic regions , such as the corotation zone , the phase space for stable periodic orbits is severely reduced .",
    "gas dynamics behaviour in this region can not be attributable to stable simple paths given by periodic orbits @xcite . in these regions , chaotic stellar orbits might be the ones supporting large scale structures , and gas might not be able to follow chaotic orbits since their trajectories are , in general , self - intersecting",
    ".    since observations of the spiral structure of the milky way are well fitted by four arms in the gas and two in the stars , the orbits that support such structures can not be the same .",
    "the differences in the orbital behaviour of gas and stars shown here highlights the difficulty of extrapolating the results of stellar dynamics to gas dynamics . even if the motion is dominated by gravity",
    ", other physical processes may have a strong impact on the overall behaviour of a galactic disk .",
    "the authors wish to thank p. patsis for useful discussions on the subject , w. henney for reviewing the manuscript , and an anonymous referee for comments that led to a much improved paper .",
