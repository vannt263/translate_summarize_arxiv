    "[ fig12 ] , and this should be responsible for the different lifetimes of the ring dark solitons between @xmath1na and @xmath2rb condensates .    so ring dark solitons of the ferromagnetic condensate incline to decay into vortex and anti - vortex pairs much earlier than that of the antiferromagnetic condensate .",
    "as it is known , modulational instability is possible in ferromagnetic spinor condensates @xcite . and",

    "in conclusion , the generation and dynamics of the ring dark solitons in both spin-@xmath0 @xmath1na and @xmath2rb condensates are explored by simulating the phase engineering technique numerically .",
    "we find that the characteristics of the far - off resonant laser pulse , such as the stark - shift potential width ( revealed by @xmath59 ) and the duration of the beam @xmath55 ( revealed by @xmath87 ) , affect the dynamical properties of the condensate dramatically , including the lifetime and the decay profiles of the ring dark solitons .",
    "we choose optimal parameters to generate nearly black ring solitons . if only one ring dark soliton in one component of the condensate is generated , ring dark solitons in other components are induced , and they compose a coexistence state , which exhibits dynamical oscillations for hundreds of milliseconds .",
    "the oscillation of the coexistence state can live hundreds of milliseconds because of the mutual filling and spin mixing of different components .",
    "the coexistence state is more likely to be stabilized in presence of all the three components of the condensate .",
    "the coexistence state can enjoy a longer lifetime in the @xmath1na condensate than that in the @xmath2rb condensate .",
    "however , if the coexistence structure is induced by an obviously off - centered ring dark soliton , it suffers an earlier collapse with the appearance of vortex and anti - vortex pairs .",
    "this work may help to realize manipulation of ring dark solitons in high - dimensional multicomponent becs .",
    "because of the long lifetime of the ring structures ( more than @xmath121 @xmath24 for @xmath2rb ) , we hope that our results can stimulate investigation of high - dimensional ring dark solitons in future spinor bec experiments .",
    "in fact , the density engineering and phase engineering can be utilized together to generate more perfect ring dark structures , whose lifetime should be much longer . besides , the fr technique is waiting to be used to manipulate ring dark solitons in spinor bec in the future .    *",
