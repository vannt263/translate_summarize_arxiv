    "<S> we report spatially resolved , time - dependent , magnetization reversal measurements of an fe@xmath0 single molecular magnet using a microscopic hall bar array . we found that under some conditions the molecules reverse their spin direction at a resonance field in the form of an avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> the avalanche front velocity is of the order of @xmath1  m / sec and is sensitive to field gradients and sweep rates . </S>",
    "<S> we also measured the propagation velocity of a heat pulse and found that it is much slower than the avalanche velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that in fe@xmath0 , the avalanche front propagates without thermal assistance .    </S>",
    "<S> single molecular magnets ( smm ) are an excellent model system for the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena and their interplay with the environment . in recent years , the focus of these studies shifted from single molecule to collective effects . while there are two famous smm that show quantum behavior , namely , fe@xmath0 and mn@xmath2 , most of the work on collective effects has been focused on mn@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in mn@xmath2 intriguing effects were found , such as deflagration @xcite , quantum assisted deflagration @xcite , and detonation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in all these cases , a spin reversal front propagates through the sample as an avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> although showing some signs of quantum behavior hernandez2005 , these processes are based on over - the - barrier magnetization reversal . here , we focus on the spin avalanche phenomena in fe@xmath0 , where pure quantum effects exist at dilution refrigerator ( dr ) temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the avalanche velocity @xmath3 for various sweep rates and applied field gradients . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the thermal diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath4 is much faster than the velocity at which heat or matching field propagates through the sample . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath3 is affected by field gradients . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the avalanche in fe@xmath0 is a quantum effect sometimes called cold deflagration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fe@xmath0 provides the first experimental manifestation of such cold deflagration .    </S>",
    "<S> the fe@xmath0 smm has spin @xmath5 ground state , as does mn@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic anisotropy correspoding to an energy barrier between the spin projection quantum number @xmath6 and @xmath7 is @xmath8  k worensdorferscience99,mukhin2001,barra1996,caciuffo1998,park2002 ; in mn@xmath9 this anisotropy is  @xmath10  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fe@xmath0 molecules show temperature - independent hysteresis loops at @xmath11  mk , with magnetization jumps at matching fields that are multiples of @xmath12  twernsdorfer2000,wernsdorfer1999 . however , when tunneling is taking place from state @xmath13 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , the excited state can decay to the ground state @xmath16 , releasing energy in the process . in a macroscopic sample </S>",
    "<S> , this energy release can increase the temperature and support a deflagration process by assisting the spin flips . </S>",
    "<S> spontaneous deflagration in mn@xmath2 takes place at various and not necessarily matching fields higher than @xmath1  t. the deflagration velocity starts from @xmath1  m / sec and increases with an increasing ( static ) field up to @xmath17  m / sec suzuki2005 .    </S>",
    "<S> our avalanche velocity measurements are based on local and time - resolved magnetization detection using a hall sensor array . </S>",
    "<S> the array is placed at the center of a magnet and gradient coils . a schematic view of the array and coils is shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the array is made of hall bars of dimensions 100@xmath18100 @xmath19m@xmath20 with 100 @xmath19 m intervals ; the active layer in these sensors is a two - dimensional electron gas formed at the interface of gaas / algaas heterostructures . </S>",
    "<S> the surface of the hall sensors is parallel to the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the effect of the applied field on the sensor is minimal and determined only by the ability to align the array surface and field . the sample and sensors </S>",
    "<S> are cooled to @xmath21  mk using a dr . </S>",
    "<S> more details on the hall measurements can be found in the supplemental material .    </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field gradient could also be produced by two superconducting coils wound in the opposite sense . </S>",
    "<S> they are placed at the center of the main coil and produce @xmath22 mt / mm per ampere . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no option of adjusting the sample position after it has been cooled it is reasonable to assume that the sample is not exactly in the center of the main magnet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the sample has corners and edges . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a field gradient is expected even when the gradient coils are turned off .    in the experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the molecules are polarized by applying a magnetic field of @xmath23  t in the @xmath24 direction . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards , the magnetic field is swept to @xmath25  t. the sweep is done at different sweep rates and under various applied magnetic field gradients . during the sweep , </S>",
    "<S> the amplified hall voltage from all sensors and the external field are recorded . from the raw field - dependent voltage of each sensor , </S>",
    "<S> a straight line is subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> this line is due to the response of the hall sensor to the external field . </S>",
    "<S> the line parameters are determined from very high and very low fields where no features in the raw data are observed .    in our experiments , we found that fe@xmath0 samples can be divided into two categories : those that do not show avalanches , which have multiple magnetization steps regardless of the sweep rate , and those that show avalanches where the number of magnetization steps depends on the sweep rate . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we present the normalized hall voltage as detected by one of the hall sensors from a sample of the first category . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization is by the voltage at a field of 1 t where the molecules are fully polarized . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the normalized voltage provides @xmath26 , where m is the magnetization and @xmath27 is the saturation magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the bottom abscissa is for a sweep where the field decreases from @xmath1  t. the top abscissa is for a sweep where the field increases from @xmath28  t. the magnetization shows typical steps at intervals of 0.225  t. no step is observed near zero field . in addition , the hysteresis loop s coercivity increases as the sweep rate increases . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in agreement with previous measurements on fe@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are presented here to demonstrate that the hall sensors are working properly , that their signals indeed represent the fe@xmath0 magnetization , and that in some samples all magnetization steps are observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis loop of a sample from the second category is plotted in the bottom inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , there is a small magnetization jump at zero applied field , followed by a nearly full magnetization reversal at a field of @xmath29  t in the form of an avalanche . in all samples tested in this and other experiments in our groupleviantphotons , </S>",
    "<S> avalanches occurred only at the first matching field . </S>",
    "<S> we could not tell in advance whether a sample was of the first or second category . </S>",
    "<S> we always worked with samples of approximately the same dimensions ( @xmath30 mm@xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to mn@xmath2 , where avalanches are associated with large samples @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> avalanche velocity measurements in fe@xmath0 should be done with extra care . in an avalanche </S>",
    "<S> there is , of course , a propagating front where spins flip . </S>",
    "<S> but since our measurement in fe@xmath0 are done by sweeping the field through resonance , there is a similar front even without avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . in this inset , a sample placed off the symmetry point of a symmetric field profile </S>",
    "<S> is shown . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sample experiences a field gradient . due to this gradient , </S>",
    "<S> tunneling of molecules will start first at a particular point in the sample where the local field is at matching value . </S>",
    "<S> the spin reversal front will then propagate from that point to the rest of the sample as the external field is swept . in this case , pausing the field sweep will stop the magnetization evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] for an avalanche free sample . </S>",
    "<S> the left ordinate is the normalized hall voltage ( solid symbols ) from three different sensors on the array . </S>",
    "<S> each symbol represents a different sensor . </S>",
    "<S> the right ordinate is the applied magnetic field ( line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage and field are plotted as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on fields before , near , and after the third transition in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . for the most part </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetization changes only when the field changes , even in the middle of a magnetization jump . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the sample is subjected to some field gradients and a tunneling front propagates through the sample even without an avalanche . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to estimate the matching field front velocity of @xmath32  m / sec from a typical transition width ( @xmath33  t ) , a typical sweep rate ( @xmath34  mt / sec ) and the sample length ( @xmath35  mm ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we zoom in on the magnetization jump of samples from the second category at a @xmath29  t field . in this figure , we show the time - resolved hall voltage from five different sensors along the array . </S>",
    "<S> the three middle sensors show a peak in the hall voltage , which is experienced by each sensor at different times . </S>",
    "<S> the two outer sensors experience a smoother variation of the hall voltage , in the form of cusps , also at different times . </S>",
    "<S> this type of behavior is a clear indication of a magnetization reversal avalanche propagating from one side of the sample to the other . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks and cusps are due to a zero magnetization front , where the magnetization @xmath36 changes sign due to tunneling . at the same front </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic induction @xmath37 from the sample is forced to point outward and toward the sensors , to maintain zero divergence friedman2010 . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . by following the time evolution of the peaks and cusps </S>",
    "<S> , we can determine the front velocity . </S>",
    "<S> since the sensors are spaced by parts of a millimeter and the peaks are spaced by parts of a millisecond , the avalanche velocity @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath1  m / sec , which is much higher than @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> we found that the avalanche propagation direction can be affected by applying field gradients as long as the sweep rate is low . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . in this figure </S>",
    "<S> , we show for each detector location the time at which it experiences a peak or a cusp . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of each line is the avalanche velocity . for the lowest sweep rate of 0.83  </S>",
    "<S> mt / sec with no gradient , the velocity is negative . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes positive as the gradient is switched on to 0.14 mt / mm , but becomes slower as the gradient increases to 0.69  mt / mm . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the gradient is opposite and weaker for our highest sweep rate of 8.3  mt / sec . in this case , all velocities are positive and increase as the gradient increases . only at the intermediate sweep rate of @xmath40  </S>",
    "<S> mt / sec does the gradient have no effect on the velocity . </S>",
    "<S> although we find it challenging to explain the gradient dependence of the avalanche velocity , we do learn from this experiment that the safest sweep rate from which one can estimate the avalanche velocity is around @xmath41  mt / sec . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the external gradient does not affect the velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between sweep rates and gradient ( when it is on ) is a quantity with units of velocity of the order of tens of millimeters per second . </S>",
    "<S> this is much lower than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the gradient experiment is another indication , but with an avalanching sample , that the propagation of the external magnetic field does not determine the avalanche velocity , and that @xmath4 is an internal quantity of the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our ability to affect @xmath3 with the gradient field rules out the possibility that the avalanche is due to over - the - barrier spin flips .    finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we depict the avalanche velocities @xmath3 as a function of sweep rate with zero applied gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the field was swept from positive to negative and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the sample used in this experiment was of the second category and produced avalanches only for sweep rates higher than 3  mt / sec . </S>",
    "<S> slower sweep rates generated the usual magnetization jumps , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although there is some difference between the velocity for different sweep directions , it is clear that the velocity tends to increase with increasing sweep rate , and perhaps saturate . in light of the gradient experiment , the most representative avalanche velocity of fe@xmath42 is @xmath43  m / sec .    to clarify the role of heat propagation in the avalanche process of fe@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we also measured the thermal diffusivity @xmath44 between @xmath45  mk and @xmath1  k. this is done by applying a heat pulse on one side of the sample for a duration of @xmath46 msec , and measuring the time - dependent temperature on the hot side ( @xmath47 ) and on the cold side ( @xmath48 ) of a sample of length @xmath49  mm . </S>",
    "<S> more experimental details are provided in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal diffusivity is defined via the heat equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the location and time dependent temperature along the sample . for a long rod @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , one has that @xmath53we fit this expression to our @xmath54 data with @xmath55 and @xmath44 as fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 accounts for the coupling of the two thermometers to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the fit is shown by the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the fit is not perfect , it does capture the data quite well . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath44 obtained with this method at a few different temperatures is depicted in the inset of fig.[fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 and @xmath56 obey the long rod condition . </S>",
    "<S> it is much smaller than @xmath44 of mn@xmath2 , which is estimated to be @xmath57 to @xmath58 m@xmath20/sec @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , we can generate a heat velocity @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the sample cross section . at @xmath61  </S>",
    "<S> mk we find that @xmath62 m / sec . </S>",
    "<S> this is roughly @xmath63 divided by the time between the peak of @xmath64 and that of @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> our experiments show that @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the spin reversal front outruns the matching field as it crosses the sample . </S>",
    "<S> more important , the avalanche outruns the heat generated in its wake . </S>",
    "<S> every new molecular spin that tunnels does so at the dr temperature . </S>",
    "<S> although heat is produced in the process , this heat does not propel the tunneling front forward . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the avalanche starts only at the first matching field and it s velocity is affected by a field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the avalanche properties are sensitive to the resonance conditions . </S>",
    "<S> all these observations render the avalanche in fe@xmath0 a quantum mechanical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the open question is then what sets its velocity . a natural guess , of tunnel splitting @xmath67  sec@xmath68 times </S>",
    "<S> unite cell size of @xmath69  nm , namely , @xmath70  m / sec is too slow @xcite . therefore , to address this question , more profound considerations have to be taken into account .    </S>",
