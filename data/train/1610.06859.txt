    "we assembled a model of a self - replicating cyanobacterial cell based on a genome - scale metabolic reconstruction of the cyanobacterium _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "the model incorporates a manually curated representation of all key processes relevant to the energetics of phototrophic growth : photons are absorbed by light - harvesting antennae , the phycobilisomes , attached primarily to photosystem ii ( psii ) .",
    "the energy derived from absorbed photons drives water splitting at the oxygen - evolving complex ( oec ) and , via the photosynthetic electron transport chain ( etc ) , results in the regeneration of cellular atp and nadph .",
    "the etc consists of a set of large protein complexes , psii , cytochrome b@xmath1f complex ( cytb@xmath1f ) , photosystem i ( psi ) , and atp synthase ( atpase ) , embedded within the thylakoid membrane .",
    "inorganic carbon is taken up via co@xmath2 concentrating mechanisms ( ccms ) and assimilated via the calvin - benson cycle .",
    "the product of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase ( rubisco ) , 3-phosphoglycerate ( 3pg ) , serves as a substrate for the biosynthesis of cellular components , such as dna , rna , lipids , pigments , glycogen , and amino acids .",
    "cellular metabolism is represented by a detailed genome - scale reconstruction of _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "amino acids serve as building blocks for structural , metabolic , photosynthetic , and ribosomal proteins .",
    "all cellular components are represented by their known molecular composition .",
    "the model is depicted in figure  [ fig : model ] and detailed in the materials and methods .",
    "it encompasses a total of @xmath3 macromolecules and @xmath4 reactions , including @xmath5 metabolic and exchange reactions , @xmath6 metabolic genes , as well as @xmath7 compound production reactions .      to implement the conditional dependencies of phototrophic growth ,",
    "the rate of each process is constrained by the abundances of the respective catalyzing macromolecules and their respective catalytic efficiencies .",
    "for example , at any point in time , each individual metabolic reaction is constrained by the abundance of its catalyzing enzyme ( or enzyme complex ) and the respective catalytic turnover number  @xmath8 .",
    "the latter values are globally sourced from databases @xcite , see materials and methods .",
    "protein synthesis is limited by the abundance of ribosomes and modeled according to general principles of peptide elongation , taking into account energy expenditure ( one atp and two gtps per amino acid ) and coupling to metabolism .",
    "light absorption at psii is constrained by the reported effective cross - section of phycobilisomes and depends on ( variable ) phycobilisome rod length .",
    "detachment of phycobilisomes from psii reduces energy transfer to the oec . for simplicity , light absorption at psi",
    "is assumed to take place in the absence of phycobilisomes using an effective cross - section per psi complex and energy spillover from psii is not considered ( see supplementary text for further discussion ) . for the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains ,",
    "maximal catalytic rates per protein complex are sourced from the literature .",
    "we note that all aforementioned dependencies only constrain maximal rates of processes , actual rates may be lower due to ( unknown ) fractional saturation of reaction rates .      during a full ld cycle , the capacity constraint induced by the abundance of catalyzing compounds on each maximal reaction rate",
    "must be fulfilled at each point in time .",
    "catalyzing compounds , however , can be synthesized _ de novo _ , depending on available resources , and may therefore accumulate over a diurnal period , and hence increase the capacity of the respective reactions . to this end ,",
    "the abundances of macromolecules ( metabolic enzymes , transporters , photosynthetic and respiratory protein complexes , phycobilisomes , and ribosomes ) are time - dependent quantities that are governed by the respective differential mass - balance equations . to solve the global resource allocation problem , the mass - balance equations including the abundance - dependent rate constraints are cast into a linear programming ( lp ) problem .",
    "the lp - problem is supplemented by periodic boundary conditions for the macromolecules of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes ( absolute ) abundances of time - dependent cellular components at time  @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the initial time , and @xmath13 the multiplication factor .",
    "the elements of @xmath14 at time @xmath11 are themselves an outcome of the resource allocation problem and not specified externally .",
    "time is discretized using a gau implicit method ( midpoint rule ) .",
    "we are primarily interested in diurnal dynamics , and hence a time - scale of several hours . following the arguments of rgen et al .",
    "@xcite and waldherr et al .",
    "@xcite , we therefore assume that internal metabolites are in quasi - steady - state .",
    "equation  [ [ eq : growth ] ] represents balanced growth in a periodic environment .",
    "specifically , we assume stationary diurnal experimental conditions , such that the average measured cellular composition per unit biomass after a full diurnal period is invariant . equation  [ [ eq : growth ] ] , in conjunction with the mass - balance constraints , the abundance - dependent rate constraints , and the growth objective , @xmath15 , define a self - consistent resource allocation problem for diurnal phototrophic growth of the cyanobacterium _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "pcc 7942 . as input parameters",
    ", we require the stoichiometric composition of macromolecules in terms of their constituent amino acids and micro - nutrients , as well as their catalytic efficiencies per enzyme or enzyme - complex .",
    "we argue that reasonable approximation of both quantities exist for almost all cellular macromolecules . using this narrow and well - defined set of parameters ,",
    "we seek to derive the emergent properties of diurnal phototrophic growth without making use of any further ad - hoc assumptions about metabolic functioning or regulation . for details of the implementation and a discussion of the limits of applicability",
    "see the materials and methods and the supplement .      prior to the evaluation of diurnal dynamics ,",
    "we evaluate light - limited growth under constant light .",
    "the uptake of all other nutrients , in particular inorganic carbon , is described by simple michaelis - menten uptake reactions and only constrained by the availability of the respective transporters .",
    "carbon cycling is not considered explicitly , the respective energy expenditure is considered as part of general maintenance . solving the global resource allocation problem , we obtain the multiplication factor @xmath13 and the growth rate @xmath16 as a function of light intensity , as well as the cellular composition for different growth rates .",
    "key results are shown in figure  [ fig : constlight ] .",
    "for comparison with conventional flux balance analysis ( fba ) , we use a light intensity @xmath17 photons@xmath18 , resulting in the absorption of @xmath19 photons@xmath20 , a growth rate of @xmath21 ( multiplication factor @xmath22 ) , and an oxygen evolution rate of @xmath23 .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with previous estimates using fba  @xcite , and the respective experimental data  @xcite .",
    "in particular , evaluating the metabolic reconstruction of _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "pcc 7942 with conventional fba and a static biomass objective function ( bof ) using a light uptake of @xmath24 photons @xmath25 absorbed , results in an oxygen evolution rate of @xmath23 and a growth rate of @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast to the static bof used in fba , the cellular composition of the autocatalytic model is an emergent result of the global resource allocation problem ( figure  [ fig : constlight]d ) , and is in good agreement with previously reported bofs  @xcite .",
    "when evaluating different light intensities , the growth rate and oxygen evolution increase with increasing light ( figure  [ fig : constlight]a and  [ fig : constlight]b ) . we note that light uptake depends on the assumed maximal effective cross section of psii , reported to be @xmath26  @xcite  the results shown in figure  [ fig : constlight ] indicate that the reported value underestimates the actual effective cross section ( with no further impact on model results , see also supplementary text ) .",
    "similar to findings for models of heterotrophic growth , the relative amount of ribosomes increases with increasing growth rate ( figure  [ fig : constlight]c ) .",
    "we observe that growth as a function of light saturates at a growth rate of @xmath27 ( multiplication factor @xmath28 ) , estimated using a monod growth equation ( supplementary figure s2 ) .",
    "the maximal growth rate is slightly slower than the maximal growth rate observed for _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "pcc 7942 , reported as @xmath29 by yu et al .",
    "we therefore performed a sensitivity analysis of growth rate as a function of estimated parameters . while the sensitivity with respect to the catalytic efficiencies of invidual enzymes is rather low ( supplemental figures s3-s5 ) , a major determinant of maximal growth rate is the assumed ratio of non - catalytic ( quota ) proteins ( supplemental figure s6 ) .",
    "based on recent proteomics data for slow growing cells  @xcite , the ratio was determined to be @xmath30% of total protein .",
    "no experimental estimates exist for fast growing cells .",
    "if the actual percentage for fast growing cells is assumed to be @xmath31% , the resulting growth rates ( @xmath32 , corresponding to a division time of @xmath33 ) are in good agreement and slightly exceed fastest known growth rates of _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "pcc 7942  @xcite .      going beyond constant light conditions",
    ", we next evaluate the global resource allocation problem for diurnal light conditions as a dynamic optimization problem with the objective @xmath34 .",
    "after discretization , the problem is transformed into a sequence of linear optimization problems and solved to global optimality using a binary search .",
    "we emphasize that our approach does not impose any constraints on the timing of specific synthesis reactions .",
    "rather , the resulting time - courses as well as the cellular composition @xmath10 are emergent properties of the global resource allocation problem .",
    "the light intensity was modeled as a sinusoidal half - wave with a peak light intensity of @xmath35 photons @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : referenceday]a shows the resulting flux values for a reference day as a function of diurnal time .",
    "we observe that most metabolic activity takes place during the light period . in the absence of light ,",
    "glycogen is mobilized and utilized for cellular maintenance , serving as a substrate for cellular respiration via the pentose phosphate pathway and ultimately cytochrome c oxidase .",
    "figure  [ fig : referenceday]b shows selected metabolic fluxes as a function of time together with the respective enzymatic capacity ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the observed flux activity is in good agreement with known facts about metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth  @xcite : in the presence of light , carbon is imported and assimilated via the calvin - benson cycle .",
    "carbon assimilation and photosynthesis follow light availability .",
    "synthesis of macromolecules is distributed over the light period ( figure  [ fig : referenceday]b ) .",
    "firstly , at dawn , fluxes related to central metabolism , amino acids and pigment synthesis increase .",
    "secondly , reactions with respect to lipid synthesis , dna / rna synthesis , and peptidoglycan synthesis exhibit increased flux .",
    "finally , reactions related to _ de novo _ synthesis of co - factors ( nadph , thf , tpp , fad ) carry flux . at dusk ,",
    "almost all metabolic activities cease .",
    "dark metabolism is dominated by utilization of storage products and respiratory activity : stored glycogen is mobilized and consumed via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway ( oppp ) , thereby generating nadph for the respiratory electron transport chain .",
    "the global cellular resource allocation problem gives rise to a highly coordinated metabolic activity over a diurnal period .",
    "the numerical results are highly robust with respect to changes in parameters .",
    "growth rates and overall cellular composition ( supplementary figure s7 ) depend on peak light intensity , the results ( supplementary figures s8 and s9 ) are qualitatively similar to the case of constant light shown in figure  [ fig : constlight ] .",
    "glycogen is the main storage compound in cyanobacteria .",
    "cells accumulate glycogen during the light phase and mobilize it as a source of carbon and energy during the night .",
    "it was recently shown that the timing of glycogen accumulation is under tight control of the cyanobacterial circadian clock and disruption of the clock results in altered glycogen kinetics  @xcite .",
    "we therefore evaluate the optimality of glycogen accumulation in the context of the global resource allocation problem .",
    "we note that our simulation does not impose any _ ad hoc _ constraints on the kinetics and timing of glycogen synthesis .",
    "rather , accumulation of glycogen is a systemic property that emerges as a consequence of optimal resource allocation .",
    "figure  [ fig : glycogen]a shows the time course of glycogen accumulation obtained from the global resource allocation problem over two diurnal periods . figure  [ fig : glycogen]b shows the optimal carbon partitioning during the light period . stored",
    "glycogen increases linearly within the light period , in good agreement with recent data from _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "7942  @xcite , and _ synechocystis _ sp . pcc 6803  @xcite .",
    "we note that a linear slope is not self - evident , but emerges as a trade - off between at least two conflicting objectives : minimal withdrawal of carbon during the early growth period ( favoring carbon withdrawal later in the day ) versus a minimal capacity requirement for the synthesis pathway ( favoring constant withdrawal throughout the light period ) . to further highlight glycogen accumulation as a systemic property",
    ", we evaluate the minimal amount of accumulated glycogen for different light periods .",
    "figure  [ fig : minglycogen ] shows the results for different lengths of day versus night periods . if the night period is doubled , slightly less than twice the glycogen is required to sustain night metabolism and the amount of glycogen required at dusk exhibits a certain plasticity .",
    "the latter fact corresponds to differences in resource allocation with no discernible effect on overall growth : certain synthesis tasks , in particular lipid synthesis , can be relegated to the end of the night period , thereby requiring less enzyme capacity during the day at the expense of an increased glycogen requirement at dusk ( supplementary figure s11-s12 ) .",
    "phototrophic growth under diurnal conditions requires a precise coordination of metabolic processes  which is challenging to describe using conventional fba and related constraint - based approaches  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we developed a genome - scale model that allows us to evaluate the stoichiometric and energetic constraints of diurnal phototrophic growth in the context of a global diurnal resource allocation problem . building upon previous works  @xcite ,",
    "our approach is based on the fact that growth is inherently autocatalytic : the cellular machinery to sustain metabolism is itself a product of metabolism .",
    "our focus were the net stoichiometric and energetic implications of diurnal growth on a time - scale of several hours , in particular related to the _ de novo _ synthesis of proteins and other cellular macromolecules .",
    "faster time - scales , in particular a detailed representation of macromolecular assembly , were not considered .",
    "we consider our approach to be appropriate for cells with a division time of approximately 24h or faster under diurnal light conditions",
    ". for very slow growing cells , the importance of _ de novo _ synthesis of proteins is likely diminished , and other cellular processes become dominant , such as protein turnover , maintenance and repair mechanisms .    given these limits of applicability ,",
    "our aim was an _ ab initio _ prediction of optimal diurnal resource allocation : how is metabolism organized over a full diurnal cycle ? how are the synthesis reactions of cellular macromolecules organized over a full diurnal cycle ?",
    "what is the optimal timing of glycogen accumulation during the light phase ?",
    "importantly , from the perspective of resource allocation , these questions can be evaluated without extensive knowledge of kinetic parameters and regulatory interactions .",
    "our analysis is based solely on knowledge of the stoichiometric compositions and the turnover numbers of catalytic macromolecules ",
    "reasonable estimates for both quantities are available and the respective values were sourced from the primary literature and databases .    our results , similar to time - independent fba ,",
    "are based on the assumption of optimality , and hence allow us to pinpoint the energetic trade - offs and constraints relating to diurnal growth .",
    "overall , the _ ab initio _ results obtained from the global resource allocation problem are in good agreement with previous knowledge and experimental observations about flux partitioning in _ synechococcus elongatus _ 7942 .",
    "growth predominantly takes place during the light phase . in the absence of light ,",
    "almost all metabolic activity ceases , and cellular metabolism is dominated by respiratory activity .",
    "carbon fixation and central metabolism largely follow light availability , whereas other synthesis reactions follow a specific temporal pattern  including synthesis of macromolecules well before their utilization .",
    "we note that cessation of metabolic activity during darkness is itself already a result of a trade - off between idle enzymatic capacity versus the energy requirements for synthesis reactions .",
    "as shown , similar to the observation in a previous minimal model @xcite , an _ in silico _ experiment with artificially lowered enzyme costs for glycogen synthesis and mobilization , results in increased utilization of synthesis reactions at night  thereby minimizing requirements for enzyme capacity at the expense of additional storage capacity . in this respect ,",
    "the function of glycogen is analogous to a cellular battery or capacitor  and the timing of glycogen synthesis results as a trade - off between conflicting objectives : early withdrawal of carbon from an auto - catalytic system versus minimizing glycogen synthesis capacity versus extending the time span of enzyme utilization .",
    "we consider our approach to be a suitable general framework to evaluate the optimality of diurnal phototrophic growth . as a first test , we considered the maximal growth rate , as predicted by optimal resource allocation using independently sourced parameters only .",
    "the results show that model - derived values are indeed within the typical range of cyanobacterial growth rates .",
    "since several detrimental factors , such as possible photoinhibition , are not explicitly considered within our model , the close correlation between observed and model - derived growth rates suggests that cyanobacterial metabolism indeed operates close to optimality , in particular when considering high growth rates . in this respect ,",
    "an unknown factor is the relative amount of non - catalytic ( quota ) proteins , estimated to be up to 55% of total protein for slow growing cells  @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that for fast growing cells this percentage is considerably lower .",
    "indeed , the importance of non - catalytic ( quota ) proteins as ( environment - specific ) niche - adaptive proteins ( naps ) on the maximal growth rate was already discussed by burnap  @xcite .    in future iterations",
    ", our approach can be significantly improved upon . of particular interest",
    "are the energetic implications of carbon cycling  @xcite in growing cells , light damage and its repair , as well the temporal coordination of nitrogen fixation in certain cyanobacteria .",
    "more generally , we conjecture that the global resource allocation problem described here allows us to evaluate the cost of individual genes and genomes  @xcite in the context of a growing cell , and thereby allows us to evaluate metabolic adaptations and the diversity of cyanobacterial metabolism  @xcite  ultimately aiming to understand the limits of phototrophic growth in complex environments .",
    "all simulations are based on a genome - scale conditional fba ( cfba ) model @xcite .",
    "the model is derived from a genome - scale metabolic reconstruction of the cyanobacterium _ synechococcus elongatus _",
    "the reconstruction covers @xmath6 genes and consists of @xmath37 metabolic reactions and @xmath38 metabolites .",
    "the reconstruction process was analogous to previous reconstructions  @xcite .",
    "the original metabolic network reconstruction is provided as supplementary file 2 ( sbml ) .",
    "the cfba model consists of three types of components : steady - state metabolites , quota components , and components with catalytic function .",
    "quota components have no explicit catalytic function within the model but their synthesis contributes to overall energy and carbon expenditure .",
    "we note that , different from me models  @xcite , we do not aim for a mechanistic representation of processes such as transcription , translation or assembly of macromolecules .",
    "rather , we focus on overall energetic and stoichiometric constraints on diurnal time - scales ( several hours ) .      enzymes , ribosomes and several macromolecules are denoted as components with catalytic function . for each of these components",
    "a synthesis reaction is implemented .",
    "macromolecules ( e.g. photosystems ) assemble once all constituent compounds ( amino acids or protein subunits ) are available .",
    "all components are synthesized using their molecular stoichiometry , as derived from the amino acid sequence .",
    "special attention is paid to the stoichiometries of important photosynthesis and respiration complexes , such as the photosystems or the atpase .",
    "the respective stoichiometries are listed in the supplementary material tables a1-a8 .",
    "the amounts of all components with catalytic activity are time - dependent quantities and at each point in time their amount provides an upper limit to the rates of the reactions they catalyze . assuming that a component ( e.g. an enzyme ) @xmath39 catalyzes a reaction @xmath40 , we impose the capacity constraint @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the flux through reaction @xmath40 at time @xmath11 , @xmath43 denotes the concentration of enzyme @xmath39 at time @xmath11 , and @xmath44 is the turnover number of the enzyme @xmath39 for reaction @xmath40 . in case several reactions are catalysed by the same component or enzyme , the sum of their fluxes , weighted by the turnover rates , is bound by the enzyme amount .",
    "the capacity constraint holds analogously for all macromolecules , including the components of the electron transport chain and ribosomes .",
    "main quota components are the vitamins , several cofactors , lipids , cell wall , inorganic ions , dna , rna , as well as non - metabolic proteins .",
    "these components have to be produced at the same rate as catalytic components , although they do not reinforce the autocatalytic cycle .",
    "we enforce their synthesis by imposing an initial amount proportional to their fraction of the whole cell weight and require balanced growth ( equation  [ [ eq : growth ] ] ) .",
    "non - metabolic ( quota ) proteins compete with catalytic proteins for ribosomal capacity .",
    "turnover of metabolic reactions is considerably faster than the _ de novo _ synthesis of proteins .",
    "following earlier work  @xcite , we therefore assume internal metabolites to be at quasi - steady - state .",
    "the concentrations of internal ( non - exchange ) metabolites are not explicitly represented in equation  [ [ eq : growth ] ] and the metabolic network is assumed to be balanced at all time points .",
    "similar to conventional fba , we neglect dilution by growth of internal metabolites .",
    "the turnover rates used in the capacity constraint equation  [ [ eq : enzymecapacity ] ] are sourced from the brenda database @xcite .",
    "we computationally retrieved all wild type values from all organisms for each enzyme and assigned the median of the corresponding retrieved values as the turnover number of the respective enzyme . for enzymes with no turnover numbers available",
