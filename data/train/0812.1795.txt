    "while the study of dirac fermions has emerged in several contexts in theoretical condensed matter physics , its experimental realization about three years ago , in the form of gated graphene devices ,  @xcite where the carrier density can be tuned continuously from electron - like carriers for positive bias to hole - like carriers for negative gate voltage , has prompted a prolific theoretical and experimental effort to understand the properties of this novel material .",
    "most of excitement surrounding graphene stems from one of the following peculiar properties : ( i ) electrons and holes in graphene have a gapless linear dispersion relation in contrast to the parabolic dispersion of other more conventional electron gases ; ( ii ) the carriers in graphene are chiral  a property that has striking consequences such as the `` half - integer '' quantum hall effect  @xcite ; and ( iii ) carriers in graphene live at an exposed almost perfect @xmath2d surface that is amenable to surface probes  @xcite and surface manipulation .",
    "@xcite in addition , we note that there is the potential of mass producing graphene through epitaxial growth methods ,  @xcite and that graphene has remarkable mechanical properties  @xcite which only further enhance the interest .    in this perspective , we look at one important aspect of graphene which is the influence of disorder on its ground state and transport properties . we demonstrate that for graphene , charged ( i.e. coulomb ) impurities behave qualitatively different from neutral impurities  @xcite and dominate graphene s transport properties at low carrier density .",
    "the importance of the coulomb nature of graphene impurities was first highlighted by ando ,  @xcite where by calculating the intraband contribution to the polarizability and absorbing the interband ( i.e. electron - hole ) contribution into a redefinition of the dielectric constant  @xcite he showed that charged impurities could explain the conductivity being linear - in - density as was seen in experiments .",
    "@xcite similar conclusions were obtained by nomura and macdonald  @xcite using a  complete screening \" model ( i.e. @xmath3 ) , cheianov and falko using a numerical thomas - fermi approximation  @xcite and in ref .   using the full random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "analytic expressions for the rpa polarizability function calculated first in ref .   and then in refs .   revealed that for momentum transferred on the fermi circle ( i.e. @xmath4 ) the graphene dielectric function calculated using the rpa was identical to the much simpler thomas - fermi approximation at @xmath5 ( see fig .

    "that as one approached the dirac point , one would soon encounter a situation where the gate voltage induced carrier density would be smaller than the fluctuation of carrier density induced by the charged impurities thereby breaking the graphene landscape into puddles of electrons and holes . solving numerically for the conductivity using a finite - sized kubo formalism for a limited range of impurity concentrations , ref .   concluded that the coulomb disorder model gave a _ universal",
    "_ minimum conductivity whose value did not depend on the charged impurity concentration , but that was larger than that expected for clean dirac fermions ,  @xcite while ref .   argued that this would give rise to a _ non - universal _ minimum conductivity whose value depended on the concentration of charged impurities .",

    "this theory made quantitative predictions about the dependence of the minimum conductivity and rms carrier density on the charged impurity concentration and substrate dielectric constant , and in particular argued that cleaner graphene samples would have larger minimum conductivity . ref .   then studied the ground state properties of graphene by minimizing an energy functional comprising kinetic energy , hartree , exchange  @xcite and correlation  @xcite contributions in the presence of coulomb disorder .",
    "this work made quantitative predictions about properties of the carrier density distribution , both at and away from the dirac point , and enabled ref .   to develop an effective medium theory to calculate the graphene s conductivity through these inhomogeneous puddles , capturing quantitatively the minimum conductivity plateau that is seen in experiments .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , the linear in density emerges naturally from the boltzmann transport theory of charged impurities ,  @xcite and to our knowledge , no other theory produces this linear behavior without a fine - tuning of parameters to make the scattering mimic coulomb impurities .",
    "moreover , three recent experiments have rigorously verified the high density predictions of the boltzmann transport theory . in ref .",
    "sample mobility was correlated with shift of the dirac point and plateau width showing qualitative and semi - quantitative agreement with the theory presented here .",
    "reference   were able to directly measure the effect of coulomb scatterers by intentionally adding potassium ions to graphene in ultra - high vacuum observing qualitatively all the predictions of the ( self - consistent ) boltzmann theory .",
    "finally , ref .   was able to tune graphene s fine structure constant by depositing ice on top of graphene , and thereby precisely testing predictions of the boltzmann theory .",
    "results from this experiment are shown in fig  [ fig : ice_expts ] . since the dielectric constant of the sio@xmath0 substrate and that of ice are known , there are no adjustable parameters in the theoretical curve .",
    "as described above in sec .  [ sec : emt ] , our recent theoretical work  @xcite provides a satisfactory explanation for the minimum conductivity phenomenon in graphene near the charge neutrality ( i.e. dirac ) point .",
    "in particular , early theoretical work  @xcite predicted a universal @xmath5 minimum conductivity @xmath156 at the graphene dirac point in clean disorder - free systems .",
    "the inclusion of disorder - induced quantum anti - localization effect , assuming no intervalley scattering , leads to a theoretical infinite minimum conductivity at the dirac point , whereas the presence of inter - valley scattering localizes the system leading to zero conductivity at the dirac point .",
    "this confusing theoretical picture stands in stark contrast to the experimental reality , where the graphene conductivity is approximately a constant ( as a function of gate voltage or carrier density ) around the dirac point , with this constant minimum conductivity plateau having a non - universal sample dependent value ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "it was first suggested in ref .   that the minimum conductivity phenomenon is closely related to the break - up of the graphene landscape into inhomogeneous puddles of electrons and holes around the dirac point due to the effect of the charged impurities in the environment .",
    "this physical idea was further developed into a quantitatively successful theory ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : emt ] above ) in refs .",
    ", where it was shown that a self - consistent treatment of the impurity induced electron - hole puddles coupled with the boltzmann transport theory provides excellent description of the non - universal behavior of the minimum conductivity around the dirac point . in particular ,",
    "the sample dependence of the minimum conductivity arises from the different impurity disorder in different samples .",
    "quantum effective field theories of graphene minimum conductivity , which predict a universal minimum conductivity , are inapplicable to real graphene samples because real graphene is dominated by disorder induced inhomogeneity near the dirac point , which is outside the scope of the quantum field theories .",
    "although the self - consistent effective medium theory developed by us  @xcite gives reasonable agreement with the experimental observations , the key conceptual question of what happens at @xmath5 as disorder also goes to zero still remains open .",
    "such a scenario is of course experimentally irrelevant ( since experiments are performed at finite temperatures in disordered systems ) , but the theoretical question of the conductivity crossover from the inhomogeneous boltzmann regime of refs .   to the homogeneous quantum transport regime",
    "is an interesting open question .",
    "recent attempts to understand such crossover phenomena include several complementary theoretical avenues ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "among recent relevant work not discussed in this review we mention a detailed calculation of the temperature dependent graphene conductivity due to electron - phonon scattering ,  @xcite a detailed calculation of the temperature dependent graphene conductivity due to the temperature dependence of the screening of charged impurity scattering ,  @xcite a calculation of graphene density of states as modified by impurity scattering ,  @xcite a consideration of percolation induced localization transition in graphene nanoribbons ,  @xcite a theory of charged impurity screening in graphene bilayers ,  @xcite and a prediction of graphene magnetoresistance induced by a parallel magnetic field through the spin - polarization dependence of screening .",
    "we have developed here the theory for coulomb impurities on graphene .",
    "as we have shown , coulomb impurities behave qualitatively different from short - range scatterers such as point defects or missing atoms . away from the dirac point ,",
    "the physics is well described by a semi - classical boltzmann transport theory , while at the dirac point density fluctuations dominate breaking the system into puddles of electrons and holes .",
    "we have shown how these inhomogeneities can be characterized by a mean - field self - consistent theory and by numerically minimizing graphene s energy functional , and that an effective medium theory can be employed to describe the low density transport properties giving semi - quantitative agreement with experimental results ."
