    "diffractive higgs production may play an important role in identifying and studying a @xmath3-  and @xmath4-even , light higgs boson at the lhc , see , for example , ref .",
    "there exist a wide range of predictions from a variety of models for the cross section for diffractive higgs production , which have yielded answers ranging over many orders of magnitude .",
    "one unfortunate consequence is to discredit diffractive higgs production as a possible way to identify a higgs boson .",
    "here we emphasize that the huge spread of predictions is _ either _ because different diffractive processes have been considered _ or _ because important effects have been neglected .",
    "one of the aims of this note is to guide the reader through the plethora of predictions , making critical comparisons between the different approaches wherever possible .",
    "let us consider a light higgs boson ( with mass less than 130  gev ) with the dominant @xmath5 decay . from an observational point of view",
    ", it is convenient to discuss three different diffractive production mechanisms , where we will use a +  sign to indicate the presence of a rapidity gap .    *",
    "* exclusive production * :  @xmath6 + if the outgoing protons are tagged , this process has the advantage that the higgs mass may be measured in two independent ways ; first , by the missing mass to the outgoing protons and , second , by the @xmath5 decay .",
    "so the signal must satisfy @xmath7 , with allowance for experimental resolution .",
    "moreover , the @xmath8 background is suppressed by a spin ( @xmath9 ) selection rule , which leads to a favourable signal - to - background ratio . *",
    "* inclusive production * :  @xmath10 + the advantage is a much larger cross section .",
    "however , there is no spin selection rule to suppress the @xmath8 background , and the signal - to - background ratio is unfavourable .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of the higgs mass determination is worse , as @xmath11 is not applicable . * * central inelastic production * :  @xmath12 + there is additional radiation accompanying the higgs in the central region , which is separated from the outgoing protons by rapidity gaps .",
    "although this mechanism is often used for predictions , it has , in our view , no special advantages for higgs detection .",
    "we may regard each large rapidity gap as being generated by an effective pomeron exchange .",
    "it may be _ either _ a qcd pomeron , which at lowest order is a gluon  gluon state , _ or _ a phenomenological pomeron with parameters fixed by data . the above information is summarised in fig .  1 , together with a leading order qcd diagram of each process .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we start the discussion of the results shown in table  1 with the calculation of the exclusive double - diffractive cross section by levin  @xcite .",
    "he assumed the survival probability to soft rescattering @xmath13 . to account for qcd radiation he multiplied the final result by an effective @xmath14 factor which was estimated phenomenologically assuming a poisson probability @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean multiplicity of mini - jets produced in hadron interactions with energy @xmath17 .",
    "this assumption overestimates the survival factor @xmath14 in comparison with the perturbative qcd calculation , since instead of getting the double - logarithmic sudakov - like suppression , his probability @xmath15 corresponds to a single logarithm .    in the calculation by cudell and hernandez  @xcite ,",
    "both the soft @xmath18 and hard @xmath14 survival factors were neglected .",
    "in addition to the pure exclusive process , inclusive events where an incoming proton dissociates into @xmath19 resonances were allowed , so the predicted cross section becomes larger . a crucial point , both in this calculation and in that of levin , is the normalization of the two - gluon exchange amplitude . without the double - logarithmic @xmath20  factor inside the loop integration over the gluon transverse momentum @xmath21 ,",
    "the integral is infrared divergent . to obtain a finite result the authors have to choose an infrared cut - off or to introduce a finite mass for the gluon .",
    "the value of the cut - off , or mass , is tuned to reproduce the total @xmath22 cross section , @xmath23 , in terms of the low  nussinov two - gluon pomeron exchange .",
    "it has been noted  @xcite that the use of such a prescription further overestimates the higgs production cross section .",
    "indeed , in terms of @xmath21 factorization , the higgs production forward amplitude is of the form @xmath24 where the factor @xmath25 represents the @xmath26 vertex and @xmath27 is the unintegrated skewed gluon density .",
    "the unintegrated gluon density embodies the @xmath20 factor @xcite which accounts for the fact that the gluon which participates in the hard @xmath26 subprocess remains untouched in the evolution from @xmath21 up to the hard scale , @xmath28 ; this hard scale is an implicit variable in the @xmath29 in  ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) .",
    "similarly , via the optical theorem , we may express the total cross section in terms of two - gluon exchange @xmath30 where @xmath31 , as follows from the internal kinematics of the process , and where the implicit scale in @xmath29 is now @xmath32 . at first sight",
    "it appears that ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) will give a precise normalisation of the higgs cross section , via ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) .",
    "however , in addition to the different implicit scales , the typical values of @xmath33 sampled in ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) are about two orders of magnitude smaller than the values of @xmath34 sampled in ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) . since @xmath29 grows as @xmath33 decreases and since @xmath35 , this normalisation considerably overestimates the cross section for higgs production .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath18 and @xmath14 factors were included in the prediction of the cross section given in @xcite , the result is close to that of @xcite .",
    "one reason is that these small survival factors are compensated by the use of a larger value , a much larger qcd coupling ( at low scale , @xmath36  gev ) is to be taken .",
    "however , the high - order evolution of the higgs vertex confirms the former choice  @xcite .",
    "] of @xmath37 in the @xmath26 vertex .",
    "the reliability of the prediction of the diffractive production of the higgs boson can be checked experimentally by measuring the much larger cross section for double - diffractive central production of a pair of high @xmath38 jets  @xcite .",
    "the amplitude for this process has the same structure as ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) , with the @xmath26 vertex replaced by the matrix element of the @xmath39 subprocess .",
    "the original calculation of dijet production was performed by berera and collins  @xcite .",
    "the result  @xcite , with @xmath18 and @xmath14 factors neglected and normalised to @xmath23 , is about 5600  nb for cdf dijets at the tevatron energy , in contrast with the experimental upper limit of less than 3.7  nb at 95% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "the huge difference originates from the product of three factors  the survival factors @xmath400.1 and @xmath410.2 should be included in the prediction , and the normalisation should be reduced by about a factor of 10 , since ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) should be compared to ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) at much lower @xmath33 .",
    "indeed berera and collins  @xcite had noted that the survival factors should be computed before their leading order calculation is compared with data .",
    "in fact , when account is taken of the survival factors , our perturbative approach  @xcite leads to the prediction of about 1  nb @xcite for the exclusive production of dijets corresponding to the kinematics  gev jets at the tevatron energy is far from as good as the factor of 2 uncertainty claimed for dijets of mass @xmath42 at the lhc . the contribution from the low @xmath21 domain is less under control for the cdf kinematics of ref .",
    "] of the cdf dijet search  @xcite , which leads to a dijet bound of less than 3.7  nb .",
    "let us return to the discussion of the predictions listed in table  1 .",
    "since cudell and hernandez  @xcite do not include the @xmath18 and @xmath14 survival factors , and apply a @xmath23 normalisation , we may expect that the dijet cross section would be overestimated by a factor of about 1000 .",
    "levin  @xcite includes estimates of the @xmath18 and @xmath14 factors and , following his prescription , we would expect a dijet cross section of about 1000  nb , which is still much larger than the experimental limit .",
    "there is no simple way of using these dijet overshoot factors to correct the predictions for higgs production given in refs .",
    "we can not simply scale down the predictions by dividing by the overshoot factors .",
    "the correction factor has , first , an energy dependence arising from the effective gluon density normalised to @xmath23 and , second , due to the energy dependence of the soft survival factor @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the qcd radiative effects described by the @xmath20 factor depend strongly on the hard scale , and are quite different for dijet production , with jets of @xmath4310  gev , and higgs production with scale @xmath44  gev .    instead of fixing the normalisation of the prediction for exclusive higgs production by using @xmath23 ,",
    "a more reliable method is to use the gluon density given by global parton analyses and to include the sudakov - like survival factor @xmath45 inside the loop integral over @xmath21 in ( [ eq : m_higgs ] )  @xcite .",
    "this factor provides the infrared stability of the integral , while the known gluon distribution fixes the normalisation .",
    "more recently , the method has been further improved  @xcite .",
    "first , the skewed effect is included ( using the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , that is the effect due to unequal longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the left and right @xmath46 channel gluons in fig .",
    "1(a ) : explicitly , we have @xmath47 .",
    "second , the nlo corrections to the @xmath26 vertex , and the next - to - leading correction to the double - logarithmic @xmath20 factor ( that is the single log term in @xmath20 ) , are included is almost ` at rest ' and practically does not radiate .",
    "thus , the qcd radiation is associated with the hard @xmath26 subprocess . ] .",
    "this is the method used for obtaining the numbers quoted for the third entry  @xcite in table  1 .",
    "the most delicate point , in the prediction of the cross section for diffractive higgs production , is the calculation of the probability , @xmath18 , that the rapidity gaps survive the soft rescattering .",
    "@xmath18 can not be determined using perturbative qcd and non - perturbative techniques have to be applied . to improve the accuracy of the prediction of @xmath18 , a detailed analysis - loop insertions in the pomeron trajectory ( to describe better the periphery of the proton ) .",
    "] of all available soft high energy @xmath22 and @xmath48 data was performed  @xcite . using the results of this analysis it is possible to compute the soft survival factor @xmath18 for a complete range of diffractive processes .",
    "the factors for higgs production are given in refs .",
    "@xcite . for exclusive higgs production at the lhc the soft survival factor @xmath18",
    "is found to be 0.02 .",
    "after all the above effects are included , the uncertainty in the prediction of the cross section , @xmath49  fb , is estimated to be about a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "if we allow the protons to dissociate , but still keep the rapidity gaps on either side of the produced higgs boson , then we enlarge the cross section by a factor of 310 , depending on the range of masses allowed for the dissociation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the larger available phase space for inclusive kinematics , also the gap survival factor is larger ; in fact using the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite we find @xmath50 at the lhc , while for exclusive and central inelastic production we have @xmath51 .",
    "however , we lose all the advantages of exclusive double - diffractive higgs production .",
    "in particular , we lose the good missing mass resolution provided by the proton tagger , the equality @xmath52 from the @xmath5 decay , and the suppression of the @xmath8 qcd background and of the pile - up events .",
    "we therefore do not discuss this process any further here .",
    "so far we have considered processes where there are no secondaries accompanying higgs production in the central rapidity region . by ` central inelastic higgs production ' we mean that secondaries are allowed in some central rapidity interval .",
    "two contributions to the process are sketched in fig .  2 .",
    "as we shall see in a moment , we may call diagrams  2(a ) and 2(b ) lower and higher order @xmath37 contributions respectively . in fact , much attention is paid in the literature to higgs production in pomeron  pomeron inelastic collisions , fig .  2(b ) , which , in our notation , corresponds to the higher order @xmath37 contribution to central inelastic production .",
    "so we discuss this first . the cross section for higgs production by pomeron ",
    "pomeron collisions is larger than for exclusive diffractive production , but still much smaller than that for the normal inclusive production , @xmath53 .",
    "the expected signal - to - background ratio is practically the same as for normal inclusive production but at a lower energy , corresponding to the pomeron  pomeron energy as measured by the missing mass method .",
    "we have effectively degraded the lhc energy down to energies comparable to the tevatron ! of course , the luminosity of the lhc is larger than that of the tevatron .",
    "however , the effective pomeron  pomeron luminosity contains its own small factors",
    ". the only advantage - tagging may be easier due to the lower mean multiplicity of soft secondaries , see also  @xcite .",
    "] of higgs production by pomeron ",
    "pomeron inelastic collisions , in comparison to normal inelastic production , at the lhc , is the possibility to use proton taggers to avoid pile - up problems ( associated with multiple interactions in each bunch crossing ) .",
    "usually the cross section for central inelastic production is estimated using the factorization hypothesis ,  la ingleman ",
    "schlein  @xcite . to account for the probability @xmath18 that the rapidity gaps survive the soft rescattering ( which violates factorization )",
    ", the predictions are normalised to the observed rate of central inelastic double - diffractive dijet production at the tevatron  @xcite . from a qcd viewpoint , the soft pomeron ",
    "pomeron interaction , fig .",
    "2(b ) , should be regarded as fig .",
    "2(c ) where the soft pomerons are replaced by ( low  nussinov ) two - gluon exchange .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "2(c ) contains an extra factor of @xmath37 , as compared to fig .",
    "of course , this coupling occurs at low scale , but nevertheless we should not be surprised when we find that the contribution of pomeron  pomeron collisions , fig .",
    "2(c ) , is less than that of central inelastic production , fig .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the cross section corresponding to fig .",
    "2(b , c ) was calculated using the h1  parameterisation of the pomeron flux and structure function  @xcite . in the absence of dijet data at the lhc energy , the lhc prediction of @xcite",
    "is presented without accounting for the @xmath18 factor .",
    "if we multiply this result by the same @xmath54 as in refs .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath55  fb , which is an order of magnitude smaller than 50  fb  the cross section corresponding to fig .",
    "central inelastic production , fig.1(c ) , may be regarded as higher - order qcd radiative corrections to exclusive higgs central production ( fig .",
    "allowing qcd radiation , in a central rapidity interval around the higgs boson , increases the probability of gap survival , but weakens the potential of the @xmath20 factor to provide infrared convergence of the loop integral over @xmath21 .",
    "the cross section is increased , with the extra contribution coming from the low @xmath21 region . in ref .",
    "@xcite , results were focused on central inelastic production allowing radiation only in a relatively small central rapidity interval , @xmath56 . in this case",
    ", the residual @xmath20 factor is still able to ensure infrared convergence of the loop integral .",
    "if proton taggers are installed , then the mass of the central system ( that is the higgs plus accompanying radiation ) can be measured by the missing mass method . for the large masses , up to @xmath57  tev that were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath20 factor approaches unity and almost any qcd radiation is allowed . in these circumstances",
    "there is no convergence of the @xmath21 integral , and the only possibility is to normalise the prediction to @xmath23 , recall ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) and  ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) . the typical values of @xmath33 sampled in ( [ eq : m_higgs ] ) are @xmath58 at the lhc . to evaluate ( [ eq : sigma_tot ] ) in a comparable @xmath33  domain",
    ", we use the value of @xmath23 at a much lower ( cern  isr ) energy . based on this normalisation , and including a soft survival factor @xmath54",
    ", we predict a central inelastic cross section of 50  fb , which is to be compared to the 320  fb predicted in ref .",
    "strictly speaking , the 320  fb in @xcite was calculated for pomeron  pomeron inelastic collisions , fig .",
    "2(b ) . for comparison ,",
    "if for this latter process we were to use the donnachie ",
    "landshoff  @xcite parameterization for the pomeron flux , the pomeron structure function as measured by @xcite , and the known soft survival factor @xmath18 , we would obtain 1.7  fb at the lhc .",
    "however , in @xcite the cross section was normalized using the cdf dijet data  @xcite at the tevatron , for which the dominant contribution comes from central inelastic diagrams of the type fig .",
    "2(a ) ; so comparison with 50  fb is more relevant .",
    "note that the dijet mass distributions are driven ( modulo detector effects ) by the logarithmic structure of the available longitudinal phase space and by the value of the pomeron intercept , and so lead to a similar mass distribution for figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "the residual discrepancy between 320  fb and 50  fb may be traced , first , to the fact that the same gap survival factor , @xmath18 , is assumed in @xcite for lhc and tevatron energies , whereas it is expected @xcite that with collider energy reflects the rise of the total interaction cross section , and is in agreement with the d0 and cdf data for the production of jets separated by rapidity gaps , measured at 630 and 1800  gev @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath59 secondly , a smaller slope , @xmath60 , is used for higgs , as compared to dijet , production ; see eq .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite . neglecting the pomeron slope , @xmath61 ,",
    "the cross section is proportional to @xmath62 . finally , at the tevatron energy ,",
    "an extra contribution to fig .",
    "2(b ) comes from reggeon  reggeon and pomeron  reggeon exchange interactions .",
    "allowing for all these effects would decrease the predicted higgs cross section of 320  fb by about a factor in the region of 510 , bringing the cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite into general agreement with our central inelastic prediction at the lhc . for the tevatron energy , instead of",
    "the number given in ref .",
    "@xcite we have entered the later prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the central inelastic configuration , it was claimed in @xcite that , by tagging the outgoing protons , and by measuring the jets accompanying the higgs , it is possible to obtain a good missing mass resolution for the higgs .",
    "unfortunately this is only true for a centrally produced system of @xmath63  close to  @xmath64 , which corresponds to a very small fraction of the events , comparable to the number for exclusive production .",
    "moreover , for the reasons listed above , the cross section was overestimated .",
    "the pomeron ",
    "pomeron approach of cox et  al .",
    "@xcite is close to that of boonekamp et  al .",
    "the main difference is that , instead of using a soft pomeron intercept @xmath65 , a larger intercept @xmath66 was used , as given by the h1 diffractive deep inelastic data . again",
    "the prediction is normalised to the cdf dijet data  @xcite .",
    "therefore the prediction at the tevatron energy is reasonable .",
    "cox et  al .",
    "@xcite use the same parameters for the higgs and dijet production amplitudes .",
    "moreover , they use the h1 analysis of diffractive data to specify the flux and the gluon structure of the pomeron .",
    "they find that their normalisation is equivalent to a soft survival factor of @xmath67 at the tevatron .",
    "the theoretical expectation for @xmath18 is about 0.05 .",
    "this implies that a significant part of the cross sections must come from the larger fig .",
    "2(a ) contributions , rather than fig .",
    "2(b ) , to compensate for the smaller value of @xmath18 .",
    "unlike all the previous approaches , the predictions of the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model of enberg et  al .",
    "@xcite are obtained from monte carlo simulations , rather than from an analytic approach .",
    "the model assumptions on soft interaction are implemented in pythia  @xcite and embody the possibility of soft spectator rescattering and initial state qcd radiation .",
    "the sci model effectively incorporates the @xmath18 and @xmath14 survival factors generated within the framework of the pythia monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "rapidity gaps are produced in the model  @xcite by additional soft colour interactions in the final state , which are contrived to screen the colour flow across the gaps .",
    "the strength of these extra soft colour interactions was tuned to reproduce the diffractive deep inelastic data obtained at hera .",
    "it was demonstrated that the model , with the same parameters , describes reasonably well the single diffractive processes observed at the tevatron .",
    "however , the generator was created to simulate _",
    "inelastic _ processes .",
    "it operates by starting from the hard subprocess and generates the parton showers by backward evolution .",
    "the generator never accounts for the important coherence between different parton showers , nor for the colourless nature of the initial particles .",
    "the incoming protons are just considered as a system of coloured partons and only the overall colour charge is conserved . as a consequence , the probability not to emit additional secondary jets ( and so to reproduce an exclusive process ) turns out to be negligibly small .",
    "in particular , such a generator is unable to reproduce the elastic cross section .",
    "originally these generators create many secondary minijets at the parton shower stage and the probability to screen all these minijets by colour interchange is extremely low .",
    "such generators were not constructed to reproduce exclusive processes , where the colour coherence effects and colourless nature of the incoming hadrons are important .",
    "for this reason we believe that the extremely low limit for the exclusive @xmath6 cross section , which would follow from such an approach , would not be trustworthy .",
    "it is informative to note that , in our perturbative qcd approach  @xcite , the effective pomeron or two - gluon exchange has relatively compact transverse size .",
    "the sudakov - like @xmath20 factor occurs inside the loop integral over @xmath21 and , in this way , the large - size ( small @xmath21 ) component of the pomeron is strongly suppressed by qcd radiative effects .",
    "when the two - gluon system forms a large - size colour - dipole it emits numerous secondary gluon jets which completely fill the rapidity gap .",
    "there is a vanishing small probability @xmath14 for the gap to survive such emissions .",
    "the main contribution to the loop integral comes from relatively large @xmath21 in the region of the saddle point @xmath68 .",
    "the value of @xmath68 grows with both @xmath64 and the collider energy @xmath69 . for a higgs of mass @xmath70  gev produced at the lhc ,",
    "the transverse size of the exchange is @xmath71  fm . on the contrary , in the approaches of references  @xcite",
    ", a soft large - size pomeron is exchanged across the rapidity gaps with transverse size @xmath72  fm .",
    "this could cause a much stronger sudakov suppression if it were to be calculated by perturbative qcd .",
    "another consequence of the small size of the perturbative pomeron concerns the validity of the @xmath9 selection rule for the semi - forward hard diffractive production amplitudes . recall that this rule plays a crucial role in the suppression of the qcd background selection rule is still valid , and suppresses the @xmath8 background , even beyond leading order , arising from events where the @xmath8 pair is accompanied by one or more soft gluons  @xcite .",
    "hence the qcd - induced @xmath8 background is expected to be suppressed both for the exclusive process and for low mass central - inelastic production where the missing mass @xmath73 is close to @xmath64 . ]",
    "@xcite . in the exact forward direction , @xmath9 by virtue of angular momentum conservation .",
    "however , violation of this rule can come from orbital angular momenta , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the transverse momentum of the leading proton and @xmath76 is the transverse size of the pomeron .",
    "therefore the admixture of the @xmath77 state is strongly suppressed for the small - size pomeron - exchange occurring in the exclusive amplitude  @xcite . on the other hand , for c - inelastic production , where the @xmath20 factor becomes inactive and we deal with a large - size pomeron",
    ", we lose the @xmath9 selection rule and , as a result , have a much larger background .",
    "the same is true for monte - carlo - based models .",
    "the soft colour interaction , which screens the colour across the gap , takes place at large distances and therefore we have no @xmath9 selection rule .",
    "so the expected signal - to - background ratio is small .",
    "we compiled a representative range of different predictions of the cross sections for diffractive production of a higgs boson of mass about 120  gev at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we critically compared the wide range of predictions and explained the origin of the differences . in summary ,",
    "the wide spread of predictions occurs either because different processes have been considered or because important effects have been neglected .",
    "the cross sections for inclusive and central inelastic diffractive higgs production are larger than for exclusive production . however , for these non - exclusive processes it is hard to suppress the qcd @xmath8 background and the signal - to - background ratio is small .",
    "second , we can not improve significantly the accuracy of the measurement of the mass of the higgs boson by tagging the forward protons and measuring the missing mass .",
    "on the other hand , the cross section for exclusive diffractive production is known with sufficient accuracy to be sure that this channel can be used to play an important role in higgs detection via @xmath5 at the lhc , provided that forward proton taggers are installed .",
    "the mass of the higgs could then be accurately measured by the missing - mass method , @xmath78  gev  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the leading order @xmath8 background is strongly suppressed by a @xmath9 selection rule .",
    "details of the calculation of the @xmath79 exclusive higgs production cross section are given in ref .",
    "the cross section is predicted to be 3  fb at the lhc , with a factor of two uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the main sources of the @xmath8 background are , at leading order , caused by gluon jets being misidentified as a @xmath8 pair , by a @xmath80 admixture due to non - forward protons and by a @xmath9 contribution arising from @xmath81 .",
    "also there is a background contribution from @xmath82 events in which the emitted gluon is approximately collinear with a @xmath83 jet .",
    "these backgrounds were considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to a signal - to - background ratio of about 3 .",
    "note that in @xcite only the @xmath84 hard subprocess was considered at nlo , and radiation for the spectator , screening gluon was not discussed .",
    "however , this latter process is numerically small because of the additional suppression of colour - octet @xmath8 production around @xmath85 ; rotational invariance around the @xmath83 quark direction causes the cross section to be proportional to @xmath86 in the @xmath8 c.m .",
    "frame  @xcite .",
    "we may summarize the exclusive diffractive higgs signal ( @xmath87 with @xmath5 ) by the following example . consider the detection of a higgs of mass 120  gev with an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath88 at the lhc .",
    "when account is taken of the efficiencies associated with proton tagging and with the identification of @xmath83 and @xmath89 jets , and allowance is made for the polar angle cuts and the @xmath5 branching ratio , then the original @xmath90 events is reduced to an observable signal of 11 @xmath5 events , with a background of 4  @xcite .",
    "we stress that the predicted value of the exclusive cross section can be checked experimentally .",
    "all the ingredients , except for the nlo correction to the @xmath26 vertex , are the same for our signal as for exclusive double - diffractive dijet production , @xmath91 , where the dijet system is chosen in the same kinematic domain as the higgs boson , that is @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "therefore by observing the larger dijet production rate , we can confirm , or correct , the estimate of the exclusive higgs signal .",
