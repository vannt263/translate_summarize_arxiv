    "since early seventies kim and noz @xcite proposed unconventional outlook on the issue of relationship between the quantum mechanics and special relativity . although they did not admit this openly , in fact , they have suggested that special relativity can be understood properly only within the framework of quantum mechanics . in many of his papers",
    "kim pointed out that known aspect of length contraction wins its clarify meaning exclusively against a background of wave description .",
    "such a view allows us to avoid many confusing and misleading interpretations that plague relativity from its very beginning and which can not be removed if one relays exclusively on the classical approach .",
    "as noticed by kim : `` if not possible , it is very difficult to formulate lorentz boosts for rigid bodies . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to be feasible to boost waves '' @xcite .",
    "the author of this paper strongly support the thesis that special relativity is integral part of quantum mechanics and that separation between these two realms is apparent and artificial .",
    "simple analysis given in @xcite showed that the source of lorenz symmetry is not relativity of inertial frames but the freedom of choice of comparison scale imposed on two quantities being given in different physical units ( like energy and momentum , and/or distance and time ) .",
    "in particular it was shown that idea of comparison scale combined with two fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics , of  planck and de broglie , provides the basis of covariant relativistic description , thereby predicts basic dynamical features of relativistic particles . it was explained also that lorentz symmetry needs to be seen as the symmetry of preferred frame ( i.e. observer rest frame ) quantum description . in this paper",
    "we continue the progress along that line by indicating that lorentz symmetry group is a natural tool to describe internal space - time structure of extended quantum objects .",
    "discussed in the paper the main consequences resulting from such non - orthodox point of view are :    \\1 . the time and length measure relativity aspect",
    "is taken over by issue of energy - dependent space - time deformation of extended quantum objects .",
    "space - time localized quantum states are shown to provide a new way of description of particle kinematics .",
    "a new picture of particle - wave duality involving running and standing waves becomes visible .",
    "the solutions of covariant harmonic oscillator equation provided by kim and noz @xcite state plausible illustration for the presented ideas .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in * section 2 * we start with a pure quantum - mechanical analysis intended to recollect the way which two light - cone momenta put together may constitute a four - momentum of relativistic particle with mass . then we introduce a concept of light - cone skeleton , which will enable us to link particle dynamical features with its space - time extensions and thus with its kinematical properties . the differential equation of feynman , kislinger and ravndal @xcite , i.e. the covariant harmonic oscillator equation , as well as",
    ", the basic properties of solutions of this equation obtained by kim and noz are discussed in * section 3*. we show / recollect also the way which scalar particle gains its mass due to vibrations of its internal space - time structure and analyze the particle ground state geometry .",
    "the light - cone skeleton structure , introduced in section 2 , turns out to be a useful quantum - mechanical tool to characterize excitation levels of _ extended oscillatory _ particle .",
    "the two kinds of such excitations , called respectively _",
    "kinetic _ and _ potential _ are distinguished and described in * section 4*. both of them are shown to be space - time localized but their physical meanings differ .",
    "the kinetic excitations are identified with four - momentum transfer carried out by running plane - waves embraced , however , within a space - time localized area which extensions are determined just by the light - cone skeleton structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the same light - cone structure is shown to spread out the potential excitations formed by standing waves .",
    "a new picture of particle - wave duality expressed in terms of kinetic and potential excitations is the subject of * section 5 . *",
    "the issue of _ oscillatory motion _ of extended quantum object is discussed next . the energy and momentum fluctuations that relate to this peculiar kind of motion",
    "are shown to be in heisenberg - witten relation which is a generalized form of heisenberg uncertainty relation proposed by witten @xcite . finally , in * section 6 * , we recollect some experimental results that in spectacular manner disclose non - locality of quantum mechanics .",
    "the klein - gordon equation for scalar particle or the dirac equation for spin - half particle are the basic tools of relativistic quantum field theory that make descriptions of massive particles possible . nevertheless , the introduction of particle mass in the relativistic case , similarly like in the non - relativistic case of schrdinger quantum mechanics , is equivalent to introduction of mass parameter .",
    "since each of the mentioned wave equations can not predict itself possible particle internal space - time structure , it is widely believed that point - particle picture is the most accurate one .",
    "conventional field theory methods , however , indicates also another , quite different way of mass introduction .",
    "a very instructive example provides us the solutions of covariant harmonic oscillator equation given by kim and noz @xcite .",
    "their analysis is complete and thorough .",
    "they showed that emerging particle picture is not point - like but takes the form of extended quantum object which internal space - time structure is characterized by wigner s o(3)-little group .",
    "another consequence resulting from kim and noz solutions is that particle mass ( or rather the mass of extended quantum object ) is generated by oscillatory - like field vibrations .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe simply quantum - mechanical structure , called further the _ light - cone skeleton _ , that underlies the solutions of relativistic oscillator equation . in particular",
    "this quantum - mechanical structure turns out to be very useful to show the way which particle internal space - time structure becomes energy - dependent , as well as , the way which particle motion can be expressed in terms of space - time localized quantum states .",
    "it was shown @xcite that four - momentum of relativistic particle with mass can be made up of two light - cone momenta of massless particles . since each of the vectors of minkowski space",
    "can be given in form of two superposed light cone vectors , from the algebraic point of view , of course , there is no surprise .",
    "the key point is , however , that in the case of on - mass - shell four - momentum the magnitudes of these two light - cone momenta are related through the scaling symmetry @xcite . this property is most easily observed in @xmath0 dimensional gauge frame .",
    "let us then recollect that introduced in @xcite gauge frame was called the frame at which momentum ( or space ) axis was chosen such to match the direction of particle motion .",
    "the gauge frame description may then reduce the four - momentum to _ bi - momentum _ one .",
    "so , let us consider a bimomentum @xmath1 given at the _ photonic frame _",
    "( i.e. the frame which axes considered at the minkowski gauge frame are the light - cone axes ) and assume that @xmath2{c}% \\pi_{0}\\\\ \\pi_{1}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% \\frac{1}{\\eta } & 0\\\\ 0 & \\eta \\end{array } \\right )   \\binom{\\frac{m_{0}c}{\\sqrt{2}}}{-\\frac{m_{0}c}{\\sqrt{2}}},\\label{bi1}%\\ ] ] describes a relativistic particle with mass @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , at the minkowski gauge frame @xmath4 where @xmath2{c}%",

    "the next two subsections are aimed to approach to these issues in the most elementary way .",
    "a natural consequence of the assumption about composite particle structure must be departure from point - particle picture .",
    "it is widely believed that such departure has been already done in terms of wave packet description , which is basically true .",
    "nevertheless , the point - particle picture still remains valid as the classical one .",
    "therefore , to emphasize the difference between point - particle and extended object conceptual views we introduce the idea of _ light - cone skeleton _ intended to describe internal space - time structure of particle with mass . as pointed out , the idea of light - cone skeleton is purely quantum - mechanical one , thus , if correct , it should play a similar role in field theory approach as the postulates of planck and de broglie do in schrdinger theory .    in order to introduce",
    "extended quantum object description we start with generic example of circle of radius @xmath11 centered at the origin of photonic ( or minkowski gauge ) frame , as shown on fig.2a * * , * * and assume that this circle embraces a space - time area where extended quantum object is localized . in terms of wave description one may expect this area to indicate the maximum of probability density of quantum object distribution .",
    "let us assume also that the geometry of considering space - time region is the ground state geometry , thereby the geometry of extended quantum object at rest ( this assumption is to become clear later ) .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    next , let us consider another space - time area , now taking the form of an ellipse ( i.e. a deformed circle ) , as shown on fig.2b * * , * * and assume that it describes the same quantum object but already at a higher energy level .",
    "let as assume also that this higher energy level ( established at the observer rest frame ) corresponds to an excited particle state that relates to particle motion ( i.e. the motion which is observed at the observer rest frame too ) .",
    "the two light cone vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 which , as it comes from fig.2b * * , * * `` spreads out '' the ellipse along its major and minor axes , will be called further the _ light - cone skeleton . _",
    "although there is no need to assign any special value to @xmath14  , and thus to @xmath12 and @xmath15 , for illustrative purpose it is advisable to consider a particle of _ model shape .",
    "_ model shape particle will be called the particle which light - cone skeleton extensions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as depicted on fig.3 , are de broglie wavelengths of light - cone momenta ( [ bi1 ] ) .",
    "the extensions of model shape particle then are directly related to its dynamical features according to @xmath18 so , the light - cone skeleton for particle of model shape is @xmath2{c}%",

    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    the light - cone skeleton structure then links particle dynamical and geometrical properties .",
    "indeed , one easily finds that there is @xmath20 correspondence between particle dynamical features expressed in terms of light - cone momenta ( [ bi1 ] ) and @xmath21 transition described by light - cone skeleton deformation @xmath2{c}% \\lambda_{c}\\\\ \\lambda_{c}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\rightarrow\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\lambda_{0}\\\\ \\lambda_{1}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\eta\\lambda_{c}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\lambda_{c}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{def1}%\\ ] ] where , due to ( [ def3 ] ) , @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "so , one finds that along with particle ( kinetic ) energy increase the area of its space - time localization becomes more and more elongated @xcite .",
    "such behavior , of course , is unpredictable within the framework of schrdinger quantum mechanics . on the other hand , it becomes visible that special relativity put in `` exclusive hands of quantum mechanics '' must provide a description of particle motion quite different from that , which by making use of classical approach , we get used to it .",
    "particle kinematics expressed in terms of space - time localized quantum states naturally blends into the landscape of quantum mechanics based on the ground of the covariant and preferred frame description .",
    "in such environment difficulties related to time and length measure do not even have a chance to appear , so that the relativity issue becomes ripped its `` mystery cover '' off .",
    "one of the consequence resulting from that is that relativity aspect is fund to provide a number interesting insights about internal particle space - time structure .",
    "given that we do have a relativistic wave equation that yield space - time localized solutions , let us try to draw some basic conclusions resulting from that .",
    "to apply the earlier results let us consider a particle of _ model shape _ which ground state probability distribution is centered in circle of radius @xmath23 in such case , as noticed , the particle must stay at rest , so that its minkowski frame bi - momentum @xmath24 along with particle energy increase its space - time structure is supposed to become changed as well .",
    "indeed , the boost transformation that induces @xmath25 must affect also the light - cone skeleton structure , thereby the geometry of the state .",
    "due to ( [ def1 ] ) , the circle area of ground state must be transformed into elliptical region of excited state .",
    "let us then explain the way which light - cone skeleton deformation shown on fig.2 * * provide informations about particle kinematics .    for that purpose ,",
    "let us assume that effectively measured quantities at the real space are not the light - cone ones but , similarly like in the case of bi - momentum ( [ bi2 ] ) , are the corresponding to them minkowski `` equivalents '' .",
    "thus , the relationship between the minkowski intervals and space - time separations of quantum object expressed via light - cone skeleton structure , as shown on fig.4a * * , * * are @xmath2{c}% \\frac{\\delta x_{0}}{2}\\\\ \\frac{\\delta x_{1}}{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\lambda_{1}\\\\ \\lambda_{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   .\\label{lc1}%\\ ] ] the physical meaning of intervals @xmath26 and @xmath27 seems to be complementary . indeed , by making use of textbook formulas which allow us to combine scaling parameter @xmath28 ( see ( [ bi4 ] ) ) with a velocity @xmath29 according to @xmath30 one obtains @xmath31 and @xmath32 note , that @xmath33 in particular , for @xmath29 @xmath34 @xmath35 the both intervals are almost equal , but in the case of @xmath36 , @xmath37 whereas @xmath38 this suggests that @xmath27 may be understood as the uncertainty of particle center ( of mass ) position inside some `` quantum region '' , in time period resulting just from ( [ uc1 ] ) .",
    "thus , one may say that uncertainty @xmath27 applies to _ point - particle _ position indeed . assuming that this _ point - particle _ moves ( or oscillates ) inside the mentioned quantum area , one may call such movement a movement in a _ classical channel .",
    "_ on the other hand , time separation @xmath26 might be identified with the time of life of temporarily localized quantum state ( do not mistake with particle life time ) , which classical channel _ _  _ _ width ( or uncertainty ) is just @xmath39 thus , the time separation interval @xmath26 might be called the uncertainty of    to find the explicit dependence between the life times of quantum state of moving particle and particle at rest , let as put @xmath40 which means that intervals @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the time separations of ground state and excited state of particle motion .",
    "then , by combining formula ( [ uc10 ] ) with ( [ uc1 ] ) and ( [ uc2 ] ) one obtains the following expressions @xmath43 and @xmath44 which explain , so - called , time dilatation effect , now in pure quantum - mechanical manner .",
    "it is clear that currently formula ( [ uc11 ] ) has noting to do with `` relativistic time measure '' .",
    "instead , one finds that the task of this `` relativistic effect '' is taken over by energy - dependent deformation of particle internal space - time structure .",
    "description of particle motion based on temporarily localized quantum states distinguishes the following two situations : the first one is when particle life - time and the life - time of temporarily localized quantum state are the same , and the second one is when particle life - time is substantially longer .",
    "so , in the latter case the quantum picture of particle motion can not be given in a form of single space - time localized region , as shown on fig.4a , but it must consist of many such regions , as shown on fig.5**. * * the particle motion then can not be considered smooth , but rather as a jump - like or _",
    "oscillatory motion_. the analysis of covariant harmonic oscillator solutions will bring us to this point again later on .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig5.eps    and finally , let us note that formulas ( [ uc1 ] ) , ( [ uc2 ] ) and ( [ cw ] ) enable us to express particle space - time extensions in form of lorentz invariant interval @xmath45 which , in clear - cut way , points out to the relationship between the special relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "relativistic oscillator wave function has been considered already by yukawa in 1953 @xcite who attempted to model the behavior of relativistic particles having internal structures .",
    "later this issue also was undertaken by feynman @xcite who paradoxically suggested himself to use relativistic oscillator wave functions instead of _ his _ diagrams _ _  _ _ for study hadronic structures and interactions__. _ _ nevertheless , the powerful method of feynman diagrams has effectively overshadowed many interesting results of bound states analysis carried out strictly within the boundaries of covariant approach .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to show that feynman equation equipped with kim and noz solutions provides two seemingly quite different particle images .",
    "the first point - particle image is associated with running waves ( and thus with underlaying structure of feynman diagrams ) .",
    "the other particle image emerges from normalizable wave functions and takes the form of extended quantum object .",
    "the differential equation of feynman , kislinger and ravndal @xcite , namely @xmath46 -\\frac{\\kappa}{8}\\left (   x_{a}^{\\mu}-x_{b}^{\\mu}\\right )   ^{2}\\right\\ } \\phi(x_{a,}x_{b})=0,\\label{f1}%\\ ] ] was aimed to describe a hadron consisting of two quarks at @xmath47 and @xmath48 bound together by a harmonic oscillator potential of strength @xmath49 .",

    "furthermore , since the algebraic structure of quarks is not taken into account , it is enough to assume that @xmath47 and @xmath52 are the coordinates of self - interacting scalar quantum object .    following the procedure of kim and noz",

    "but eq . ( [ cov1 ] )",
    "determines not only the value of particle mass , but also it dresses it up with internal space - time structure . to observe this , as well as , because of the fact that solutions of ( [ cov1 ] ) are naturally given in dimensionless units , it is advisable to write down eqs .",

    "( [ cov3 ] ) was just the starting point of kim and noz analysis @xcite .",

    "so , indeed the wave functions @xmath82 are entirely normalizable , however , the covariant oscillator problem turns out to be infinitely degenerated . to limit the degeneracy to a finite number , as well as , to retain only those solutions endowed with transparent physical meaning , kim and noz imposed a covariant condition that suppressed the time - like oscillations , thereby avoided the problem of negative energies too .",
    "the wave function ( [ psi1 ] ) then has been reduced to @xmath83 where @xmath84 kim and noz showed that wave functions ( [ psi1 ] ) constitute irreducible , infinite - dimensional unitary representation of the lorentz group which describes _ klein - gordon - like _ particles with definite momentum @xmath85 and internal space - time structure but devoid of time - like oscillations .",
    "we will make use of this crucial property later on .",
    "first , however , it is advisable to extract a physical content of solutions ( [ pl2 ] ) and ( [ psi2 ] ) and correlate the `` shape '' of particle internal structure with its four - momentum @xmath86 .",
    "kim and noz showed that wave functions ( [ psi1 ] ) form a vector space for o(3)-like little group .",
    "however , the symmetry of very ground state ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 turns out even to be the symmetry of four - dimensional sphere . keeping in mind that function ( [ g1 ] ) is given in @xmath63 units , one finds that the radius of `` ground state sphere '' is @xmath89 . indeed , since the ground state function ( [ g1 ] ) separates according to @xmath90 the same concerns the probability density distribution @xmath91 where each of the factors appear to be the gaussian distributions of the same dispersion @xmath92 .",
    "thus , if one intersect the sphere @xmath93 with e.g. @xmath94 plane one finds that included at this plane light - cone skeleton of coordinates @xmath95 ( cf .",
    "fig.2a ) becomes representative for the whole quantum object described by eq .",

    "indeed , accordingly to ( [ lc1 ] ) the light - cone skeleton structure with equal `` arms '' must describe quantum object at rest .",

    "since @xmath98 alternative form of wave function ( [ g2 ] ) is @xmath99 high symmetry of the ground state makes then that distinction between the coordinates of minkowski and photonic frames is covered .    in the next section",
    "we will show that images of point - particle and extended - particle outlined above are indeed complementary .",
    "the light - cone skeleton concept will make us possible to superimpose the both particle pictures .",
    "furthermore , we will indicate the way which particle motion can be described in terms of space - time localized wave packets .",
    "so , the issue of normalizable space - time solutions becomes of special interest especially in the context of currently lunching idea that special relativity and quantum mechanic make an indivisible whole .",
    "currently discussed approach making the special relativity basically a quantum mechanics toll , enormously simplifies the whole `` relativity '' issue .",
    "lorentz symmetry becomes no longer identified with the relative motion of inertial frames , thereby the relativity aspect of length and time measure becomes completely withdrawn from the relativity issue along with its orthodox mode .",
    "instead , lorentz symmetry group turns out to tackle the problem of description of energy - dependent geometry of extended quantum objects .",
    "it was shown @xcite that quantum - mechanical symmetry related to the freedom of choice of comparison scale combined with euclidean rotations led to the concept of lorentz group .",
    "the covariant form of differential equations encompasses then the symmetries of scaling and @xmath100 rotations . from the physical point of view",
    ", however , more important seem to be the conclusions resulting form solutions of these equations . given that one really has the solutions that describe quantum object internal space - time structure ,",
    "the lorentz group then is expected to disclose many interesting particle features . in this section",
    "we make use of kim and noz solutions to indicate the way which space - time localized quantum states tackle description of particle motion .",
    "the analysis corresponds well to this given in section 2.3 , but now , of course , goes much beyond the pure quantum - mechanical considerations .",
    "basing on the results of preceding section one finds that complete wave function of the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) is @xmath101 ( note that energy @xmath102 corresponds to @xmath103 i.e. the energy expressed in @xmath11 units ) .",
    "the wave function ( [ gsf1 ] ) describes then a relativistic scalar at rest .",
    "the form of wave function ( [ sol1 ] ) , or ( [ gsf1 ] ) , suggests that solutions of relativistic oscillator equation involves two kinds of excitations .",
    "the first kind is related to , let say , _ potential excitations , _ i.e__. _ _ excitations induced by vibrations of particle internal structure .",
    "according to ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) one finds that potential excitations are to be characterized by different mass levels .",
    "another kind of excitations , which , as it comes also from analysis before , is expected to be related directly to particle kinematics .",
    "let us call this kind of excitations the _ kinetic excitations .",
    "_ in fact the very approach based on preferred frame description invokes the space - time localized quantum states to be the states of particle motion . let us then determine the notion of  `` kinetic excitations '' in more precise manner .",
    "the simplest and most natural way to obtain the state of particle motion is to boost the ground state ( or any other state being assumed to describe particle at rest ) .",
    "let us then apply a lorentz boost to the ground state ( [ gsf1 ] ) .",
    "the running wave factor must be transformed according to @xmath104 where the components of @xmath105 are those given in ( [ bi3 ] ) . on the other hand , due to ( [ g3 ] )",
    ", the transformation of standing wave factor must be @xmath106 so , the boost action taken along the gauge @xmath107 ( or @xmath108 ) direction upon the ground state ( [ gsf1 ] ) yields the wave faction @xmath109 the coordinates @xmath110 and @xmath111 are , of course independent ones , nevertheless , from the physical point of view , they must refer to the same area of the observer rest frame .",
    "thus , the wave function ( [ gsf2 ] ) effectively assumes a form of a plane wave running inside some ellipsoidal cover , as shown on fig 6a . * *  * * thereby the momentum transfer @xmath112 carried out by this plane wave is to be localized inside that ellipsoidal cover too .",
    "this kind of four - momentum transfers , i.e. the transfers induced by space - time localized running waves have been already called the _ kinetic excitations_.    [ ptb ]    fig6.eps    there are two important remarks that help to understand better the case of kinetic excitations .",
    "the first is that action of lorentz boost considered as the transformation of minkowski frame is to be regraded as the passive transformation . in other words",
    ", the lorentz ( or poincar ) symmetry group appears the symmetry of quantum states themselves .",
    "but this , in turn , means that time and length measures of all inertial frame are always the same .",
    "it was noticed @xcite that relativistic description requires a clear distinction between the _ vital _ and _ frozen _ time meanings .",
    "to recollect , it was explained that vital time is the measure of pace of observed changes and does not undergo relativistic transformation rules . in contrary to this the frozen time , which gives us energy measure in sense of inverse time units , does . above analysis",
    "then suggests that frozen time meaning enters also description of quantum object extensions .",
    "the second thing is that probability distributions provided by normalizable solutions of covariant oscillator equation are lorentz invariants @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in particular the space - time area of maximum probability density for kinetic excitation ( [ gsf2 ] ) , due to light - cone skeleton deformation ( [ def1 ] ) , is proportional to @xmath113 @xmath114 these features , however , become visible only in the light - cone coordinate frame .",
    "it was kim who suggested to use the light - cone coordinate system as a natural language for lorentz covariant phase - space representation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that even more likely is a scenario at which descriptions based simultaneously on the minkowski , as well as , light - cone frame , play the roles that are of equal importance and complementary .",
    "the issue , one may say , resembles almost a watching of @xmath100 object at the real space . to get its complete image , in general",
    ", one needs to look at it more than just only one of its side .",
    "similarly , a picture of extended quantum object emerging from the solutions of relativistic oscillator equation needs the light - cone coordinate system to become visible .",
    "on the other hand , the other quantum object properties such as its four - momentum or the time of life need the minkowski frame ( observation ) to be established .",
    "the potential excitations were identified with the vibrations of internal particle structure , thereby describing them standing waves ( [ psi2 ] ) might be called the _ potential _ states too . similarly like in the case of kinetic excitations ,",
    "the issue of potential states considered within the context of preferred frame description gives rise to a question about their physical meaning .",
    "especially , what happens if the potential state is boosted and what is the influence on its physical meaning then ? in this subsection we focus mainly on the first part of this question .",
    "generic example of the boost of the ground state ( [ b2 ] )  showed us that along with particle energy increase the space - time area embracing localized probability distribution , by simultaneous elongation and shrinking along the two orthogonal light - cone directions , undergoes the deformations too .",
    "the use photonic frame then enables potential states to become useful probabilistic toll against the background of relativistic preferred frame description .",
    "the important question is , however , whether the boost action affects the initial character of the excitations mode .",
    "in particular , whether it provides an admixture of `` something else '' that goes beyond the pure potential excitations .",
    "fortunately the analysis of kim and noz in clear - cut way has resolved this problem .",
    "kim and noz have shown that wave functions ( [ psi1 ] )  constitute a linear infinite - dimensional unitary representation of the lorentz group . as a result",
    ", one finds that potential state @xmath115 if boosted along @xmath107 direction , turns into the boosted one @xmath116 which , in turn , can be made up of unboosted potential states again , namely @xmath117 so , the boost transformation performed on any potential state does not change its potential character at all .",
    "one needs to emphasize , however , that time - like excitations that do not appear at the level of effectively observed on - mass - shell , become inevitable components of internal ( hidden - like ) particle structure .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice also that notion of `` particle rest frame '' ( in contrary to `` observer rest frame '' ) turns out to be very tantalizing indeed .",
    "the remaining aspect of the physical meaning of potential state boost is to be discussed next .",
    "the idea of particle - wave duality undoubtedly is one of the most crucial physical ideas that moulds our physical intuitions .",
    "the postulate of de broglie @xmath118 which combines particle momentum @xmath119 with the wavelength @xmath120 and the postulate of planck @xmath121 which relates particle energy @xmath122 to the wave period @xmath123 , set up the quantum - mechanical basis for this idea .",
    "the schrdinger equation that put the postulates of planck and de broglie in `` true '' wave description reality , gave us a particle - wave duality picture , which , at the highest simplicity , is the following : the free particles are point - like whereas their wave - like nature is ( successfully ) represented by running ( plane ) waves or plane - wave packets .",
    "the key point is , however , that relativistic quantum mechanics can not not improve this picture essentially , unless the predictions resulting from the solutions of covariant harmonic oscillator equation become appreciated .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide a new picture of particle - wave duality emerging just form the relativistic oscillator equation .",
    "although this new picture goes much beyond the framework of schrdinger approach , the old schrdinger painting seems to be encompassed by the new one rather than challenged .",
    "the explicit form of wave function ( [ gsf2 ] ) written at the minkowski frame , due to ( [ psi3 ] ) , is @xmath124 where @xmath125 wave function ( [ fi1 ] ) describes then extended quantum object which dynamical features and space - time extensions are linked through the light - cone skeleton structure .    the two separate factors that constitute wave function ( [ fi1 ] ) describe respectively kinetic and potential excitations .",
    "the `` oscillatory logic '' may suggest , however , that both kinds of excitations should be arranged in `` oscillatory order '' , i.e. kinetic ( potential ) excitation should follow the potential ( kinematical ) one and so on . since @xmath126 the kinetic excitations provide us a picture of running plane waves carrying out the four - momentum @xmath112 , or alternatively , the image of point - particle endowed with the same four - momentum @xmath112 .",
    "one needs to keep in mind , however , that the area of plane waves propagation is limited to the space - time region embraced basically by mentioned light - cone skeleton s cover . on the other hand ,",
    "the same light - cone skeleton provides us the space - time extensions of the potential state . but",
    "this in turn mens that the second factor of wave function ( [ fi1 ] ) describes the particle in the form of extended material object moving through the space , as shown on fig.6b .",
    "the wave function ( [ fi1 ] ) provides then a new picture of particle - wave duality , as well as , a new description of particle motion .",
    "according to this the particle movement can not be considered smooth but , as depicted on fig.5 * * , * * must take a form of _",
    "the outlined above peculiar kind of motion inevitable must be accompanied by related energy and momentum fluctuations . to estimate the range of these fluctuations",
    "one finds the light - cone skeleton structure to become very useful again .",
    "it seems advisable , however , to recollect first the original concept of heisenberg uncertainties referred to quantum measurement process .    alongside the postulates of planck ( [ du2 ] ) and de broglie ( [ du1 ] )",
    "there are also heisenberg uncertainty principles @xmath127 and @xmath128 that constitute the basis of schrdinger quantum mechanics .",
    "it is widely believed that formula ( [ du3 ] )  describes relationship between the uncertainties of particle momentum @xmath129 and position @xmath130 in a measurement where both quantities are to be established at the same physical process .",
    "similarly , if the subject of measurement is the particle energy , then related to this uncertainties of energy @xmath131  and time @xmath41 ( needed for such measurement ) are assumed to be in relation ( [ du4 ] ) .",
    "seemingly both heisenberg expressions have little to do with pure relativistic approach and it seems rather unlikely to incorporate them into rigid relativistic framework in a self - consistent way .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out to be feasible .",
    "there are however two essential obstacles that need to be pointed out first .",
    "the first remark concerns the underlying algebraic basis of  both uncertainty relations .",
    "since the position and momentum are the @xmath132 , i.e. position and momentum have operator representatives @xmath133 and @xmath134 for which it holds @xmath135   = i\\hbar,\\label{uc14}%\\ ] ] relation ( [ uc14 ] )  is a @xmath136 uncertainty relation . in contrary to this , as noticed by dirac @xcite , the ( vital ) time is ( only ) a @xmath137 , which mens that there is no hilbert space associated to the time variable @xcite . as a result it must occur @xmath138   = 0,\\label{com2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is energy operator or a hamiltonian .",
    "relation ( [ com2 ] ) then is a @xmath137 uncertainty relation .",
    "so , the emerging problem is that heisenberg relations brought directly on the relativistic ground forces the lorentz covariant description to deal with a mixture of @xmath132 and @xmath140 which , as also noticed by dirac @xcite , can not be consistent with special relativity .",
    "the problem might become much simpler , however , if relations ( [ du3 ] ) and ( [ du4 ] )  are to be considered not in terms of @xmath141 and @xmath142 but in terms of wave packet average width - spreads .",
    "let us then consider relation ( [ du3 ] )  and assume that it just relates the widths of wave packet spatial distribution @xmath130 and longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath129 .",
    "however , if @xmath130 and @xmath129 are the quantities of minkowski frame ( as it is commonly thought ) , then the boost transformation turns the relation ( [ du3 ] ) into another one @xmath143 which , of course , violates heisenberg principle original form , thereby its universal character originally assumed @xcite,@xcite .    to overcome both mentioned difficulties kim and noz @xcite showed up that proper formulation of uncertainty principles provide canonically conjugated fourier components of wave function ( [ b2 ] ) i.e. the wave function described in the photonic frame .",
    "indeed , under such circumstances relations ( [ du3 ] ) and ( [ du4 ] ) become the light - cone frame relations . as a result",
    "they become lorentz - boost form invariants , thereby become also the integral part of the relativistic approach .",
    "the example of quantum object spread out on light - cone skeleton structure illustrates this idea too .",
    "the light - cone skeletons shown on figs.4a * * and 4b * * , * * are the skeletons of the same quantum object but considered respectively in position and momentum space .",
    "so that they are , of course , the mutually conjugated structures . in order to emphasize that relations ( [ du3 ] ) and ( [ du4 ] ) should be regarded as the light - cone ones let us apply a symbolic substitution @xmath144 and similarly @xmath145 as a result one finds that relations ( [ du3 ] ) and ( [ du4 ] ) , considered as the photonic frame uncertainty relations , become automatically fulfilled if uncertainty values ( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ v2 ] ) become identified with the light - cone skeleton extensions , i.e. when @xmath146    in order to return to the issue of oscillatory motion let us also answer the question how the light - cone uncertainty relations @xmath147 appear to the observer rest frame .",
    "let us then recollect that effectively observed particle dynamical and kinematical features , as it come from ( [ bi2 ] ) and ( [ lc1 ] ) are those of the minkowski frame .",
    "so , the same must concern the energy and momentum fluctuations , which , then , must be determined by @xmath2{c}% \\frac{\\delta p_{0}}{2}\\\\",
    "\\frac{\\delta p_{1}}{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   = \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% \\frac{\\delta\\pi_{0}}{2}\\\\ \\frac{-\\delta\\pi_{1}}{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   .\\label{mkun}%\\ ] ] thus , for the given values of light - cone momenta ( [ sk1 ] ) one obtains that energy and momentum fluctuations are @xmath148 so , for the particle of model shape one obtains that its energy and energy - fluctuations , as well as , momentum and momentum - fluctuations are the same .",
    "this just explains the occurrence of ( perfect ) transitions between kinetic and potential excitations , thereby oscillatory character of particle movement .",
    "the broad issue of duality considered within the framework of string theory presumably is one of the most exploring ideas in contemporary theoretical physics .",
    "even though the difficulty level even of quite simple string theory analysis exceeds much that of given in this paper , it seems justified to indicate some basic similarities that occur between the string theory and covariant harmonic oscillator approach .",
    "the first is that in the both cases one deals with space - time extended quantum objects instead of ( field theory ) point - particle image .",
    "secondly , it turns out that the source of particle mass might be the _ string vibrations , _ so that the concept of mass no longer seem to be elementary . and finally , for the purpose of this paper",
    ", it is enough to indicate one more common feature of the both approaches . supported by advanced calculations of gross and mende @xcite and",
    "proposed in the context of duality in string theory , generalized heisenberg uncertainty relation of witten @xcite , is found to be exactly the one of kim and noz ( [ lcun ] ) , however , being written at the minkowski frame . it is worthwhile to take a closer look at this quite elementary issue .",
    "let us consider again eq .",
    "( [ lc1 ] ) and focus on very time - like separation @xmath149 due to ( [ def3 ] ) , which allows us to express @xmath150 by means of light - cone skeleton extensions @xmath17 and @xmath151 one obtains @xmath152 expressed in a similar way the energy fluctuations ( [ mkun ] ) must take the form @xmath153 eqs . ( [ uc20 ] ) and ( [ uc21 ] )",
    "transparently reveal a dependence between quantum object space - time extensions and its dynamical features . according to ( [ def3 ] )",
    "if particle stay at rest ( @xmath154 ) both terms in both expressions ( [ uc20 ] ) and ( [ uc21 ] ) contribute the same . in such case",
    "the particle size is @xmath14 ,  which corresponds to @xmath155 however , along with energy increase ( @xmath156 , cf .",
    "formulas ( [ bi1 ] ) and ( [ bi2 ] ) ) only one term of each of the formulas ( [ uc20 ] ) and ( [ uc21 ] ) becomes dominant .",
    "thus , even though the size of the whole quantum object grows ( @xmath26 @xmath157 ) , its energy fluctuations have still heisenberg - like form , @xmath158 , where @xmath159 furthermore , since the energy increase induces @xmath17 decrease , dynamical consequences resulting from that make that point - particle picture is to become more accurate too . nevertheless ,",
    "as it comes from the discussion devoted to kinetic excitations , enlarged extensions of quantum object indicate also the space - time area where the `` point - particle '' can be found .",
    "in other words , the formulas ( [ uc20 ] ) and ( [ uc21 ] ) , in simple quantum - mechanical manner , describe a new emerging picture of particle wave - duality .",
    "but this is exactly the same what does witten formula predict .",
    "indeed , by making use of property @xmath160 one easily finds that expression ( [ uc20 ] ) turns out to be ( almost ) the witten formula @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "thus , to expose the ( possibly crucial ) role of minimal length scale ( which is assumed to be the order of planck length @xmath164 @xmath165 and thus @xmath166 ) , _ _",
    "_ _ as well as , to write down the witten formula already in its exact form , due to ( [ uc4 ] ) , one may estimate minimal size of quantum object according to @xmath167 so , as one would expect , the planck length @xmath168 is the lorentz invariant indeed and , as it comes from above , there is no need to `` double '' relativity issue @xcite to support that statement .",
    "nevertheless , a particle can not be seen as a material point but rather as an extended quantum object endowed with internal space - time structure .",
    "it is widely believed that the origin of special relativity is purely the classical one . on the other hand",
    ", there is no doubt that there would be no einstein theory if the maxwell equations and observations of michelson and morley concerning the ether existence had become known first .",
    "the key point is , however , that `` early observations '' of electromagnetic interactions are thought to be the classical ones too .",
    "even though that `` classical electrodynamics '' blows up the framework of newtonian physics , the name `` classical '' does not seem to be used improperly . given that electromagnetic field indeed is a true classical field ( whatever it means ) its quantum nature",
    "was already recognized by planck at the problem of blackbody radiation , in 1901 , i.e. before the special relativity came up .",
    "what s more , the quantum nature of electromagnetic field was confirmed by einstein himself  who discovered the photoelectric effect in 1905 .",
    "nevertheless the well - know einstein s stubbornness against comprehension of physical word in terms of quantum mechanics has been never overcame .    in 1935",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite ( epr )  in an effort to rescue `` locality '' and `` classical reality '' introduced their famous gedankenexperiment and proposed that quantum mechanics was incomplete .",
    "let us then remind the einstein locality principle @xcite : `` if @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the two systems that have interacted in the past but now are arbitrary distant , the real factual situation of system @xmath169 does not depend on what is done with system @xmath171 which is spatially separated from the former . ''",
    "then , the new class of models , called the local hidden - variables ( lhv ) models , appeared to describe statistical features of quantum measurements as a result of underlying deterministic substructure . in 1964 bell showed @xcite , however , that all lhv models that provide the results being in complete agreement with predictions of quantum mechanics do not obey the principle of locality , or , in other words , if substructures of lhv models appear to be _ truly local _ , their predictions must differ from those of quantum mechanics .    at early seventies , with the aid of bell ( inequalities ) and available new experimental techniques , a new era of gedankenexperiments begun and despite of epr expectations the results it has provided have testified strongly against the classical ideology .",
    "the violation of bell - inequalities were observed in a wide range of gedankenexperiments based mainly on two - photons correlations measurements such as : polarization correlations @xcite , energy and time correlations ( followed by experimental proposal of franson @xcite ) @xcite , or phase and momentum correlations @xcite .    additionally , it is worthwhile to single out three more experimental observations that disclose unlocal properties of quantum states in very spectacular way , namely : the franson and potocki observation of `` single photon interference over large ( 45 m ) distances '' @xcite , g. weiss et al . @xcite `` violation of bell s inequality under strict einstein locality conditions '' , and w. tittel at al .",
    "@xcite `` experimental demonstration of quantum correlations over more then 10 km . ''",
    "the era of gedankenexperiments is basically finished and its heritage was taken over by quantum teleportation already originated over ten years ago @xcite .",
    "although above mentioned experimental results clearly indicate that tight keeping on einstein s locality idea contradicts the sober view , the issue of lorentz symmetry , so far , has been never regarded in terms of the quantum approach seriously .",
    "furthermore , even from the very theoretical point of view , one finds that maxwell equations do occupy exactly the same position in quantum field theory approach as the equations of dirac and klein - gordon do .",
    "of course , these two material fields , until quantized , play the role of classical fields too . nevertheless , devoid of the context of quantum mechanics they mean nothing . in the case of electromagnetic field and lorentz",
    "symmetry the situation , presumably , is very similar .    and",
    "finally let us ask the fundamental question : is that because of einstein s time relativity idea looking so attractive , any alternative approach to `` relativity issue '' is simply out of the question ?",
    "the honest answer is , perhaps , as hard as solutions of a few challenging physical problems .",
    "the author of the parer is aware of its simplicity , thereby far from the belief that presented now non - orthodox approach might be called satisfied",
    ". it seems , however , that even more important then any field theory analysis is to realize first how substantial and `` positive flooding '' consequences of departure form orthodox relativity perception might be .",
    "the main results of analysis already started in @xcite and being continued now are summarized below in the form of concise comparison between some consequences resulting from orthodox and non - orthodox views .",
