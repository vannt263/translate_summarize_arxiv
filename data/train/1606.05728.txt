    "in recent paper of suris @xcite the effect of the centre of mass motion of the wannier - mott exciton on its binding energy in a layered semiconductor superlattices ( sl ) has been studied analytically .",
    "the sl period was assumed to be much smaller than the 2d excitonic bohr radius . as a result",
    "the electron and hole motions decompose into two parts : the fast longitudinal motion parallel to the sl axis and the adiabatically slow transverse in - plane motion governed by the sl potential and the 2d quasi - coulomb exciton field , respectively . the fine structure of each 2d exciton energy level occuring for adjacent but higher energies was found to occur .",
    "this energy group consists of closely spaced satellite energy levels which in turn relate to the adiabatically slow longitudinal relative exciton motion in the triangular quantum well .",
    "this well is formed by the quasi - uniform electric field caused by the corresponding in - plane exciton state .",
    "a similar structure was studied originally in the pioneering work of kohn and luttinger @xcite when considering the donor states in the ge and si bulk crystals with extremely anisotropic isoenergetic surfaces .",
    "the effect of the longitudinal uniform external dc electric fields on the exciton states and the exciton optical absorption spectrum in the semiconductor sl associated with the transitions to these satellite states are in this context certainly of relevance .    in the present paper",
    "this effect is investigated for the case that the period of the sl is much smaller than the 2d exciton bohr radius . in the effective mass approximation",
    "the overlapping exciton wave function is expanded over the sl wannier functions that in turn allows us using the tight - binding and the adiabatic approximations to calculate analytically the exciton states in the sl subject to the longitudinal external electric field .",
    "the dependencies of the exciton states and the exciton absorption coefficient on the sl parameters ( period and minibands widths ) and on the external electric field strength are presented explicitly .",
    "the regime of a strong electric field providing the wannier - stark spatial localization of the carriers and the more interesting regime of weak electric field which destroy the exciton fine structure , generate the extended longitudinal electron and hole states and increase the 2d exciton binding energies are considered . in conclusion",
    "we discuss the applicability conditions of the obtained results and estimate the expected experimental values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 in the tight - binding and adiabatic approximations",
    "the equation describing the exciton in the sl in the presence of the longitudinal external dc electric fields is derived .",
