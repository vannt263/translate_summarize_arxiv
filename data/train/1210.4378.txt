    "the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) consists of the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) , the x - ray calorimeter spectrometer ( xcs ) and the cooling system@xcite .",
    "the xcs is a 36-pixel system with an energy resolution of @xmath47  ev between 0.312  kev(fig .",
    "[ fig : xrs_em1 ] ) .",
    "the array design for the sxs is basically the same as that for the suzaku / xrs , but has larger pixel pitch and absorber size .",

    "the 8.5-micron - thick absorbers were fabricated by epir corporation and diced using reactive ion etching .",
    "these absorbers provide high quantum efficiency across the 0.312  kev band . despite the larger pixel size for the sxs ( factor of 1.7 in volume )",
    ", the energy resolution is substantially improved from @xmath7 6 ev to @xmath7 4 ev ( fwhm ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrs_em2 ] ) .",
    "the main reasons for this are that epir developed a process to produce hgte with lower specific heat and that the operating temperature of the instrument has been lowered from 60 mk to 50 mk@xcite .    fe",

    "the detector assembly provides electrical , thermal , and mechanical interfaces between the detectors ( calorimeter array and anti - coincidence particle detector ) and the rest of the instrument .",
    "the sxt for the xcs is an upgraded version of the suzaku x - ray telescope with improved angular resolution and larger collecting area@xcite .",
    "the sxs effective area at 6  kev will be at least 210  @xmath8 , a 60  % increase over the suzaku xrs , while at 1  kev the sxs has 160  @xmath8 , a 20  % increase .",
    "the xcs cooling system must cool the array to 50  mk with sufficient duty cycle to fulfill the sxs scientific objectives : this requires extremely low heat loads . to achieve the necessary gain stability and energy resolution",
    ", the cooling system must regulate the detector temperature to within 2  @xmath5k rms for at least 24  hours per cycle@xcite . from the detector stage to room temperature , the cooling chain is composed of a 3-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator ( adr ) , superfluid liquid @xmath9he ( hereafter lhe ) , a @xmath9he joule - thomson ( jt ) cryocooler , and 2-stage stirling cryocoolers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrs ] . )",
    "an adr has been adopted because it readily meets the requirements for detector temperature , stability , recycle time , reliability in the space environment , and previous flight heritage@xcite .",
    "the design of stirling cryocoolers is based on coolers developed for space - flight missions in japan ( suzaku , akari , and the smiles instrument deployed on the iss@xcite ) that have achieved an excellent performance with respect to cooling power , efficiency , long life and mass .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=207 ]    in combination with a high throughput x - ray telescope , the sxs improves on the chandra and xmm - newton grating spectrometers in two important ways . at e @xmath10 2  kev ,",
    "sxs is both more sensitive and has higher resolution ( fig.[fig : xrs2 ] ) , especially in the fe k band where sxs has 10 times larger the collecting area and much better energy resolution , giving a net improvement in sensitivity by a factor of 30 over chandra .",
    "the broad bandpass of the sxs encompasses the critical inner - shell emission and absorption lines of fe i - xxvi between 6.4 and 9.1  kev .",
    "fe k lines provide particularly useful diagnostics because of their ( 1 ) strength , due to the high abundance and large fluorescent yield ( 30% ) , ( 2 ) spectral isolation from other lines , and ( 3 ) relative simplicity of the atomic physics .",
    "fe k emission lines reveal conditions in plasmas with temperatures between 10@xmath11 and 10@xmath12 k , which are typical values for stellar accretion disks , snrs , clusters of galaxies , and many stellar coronae . in cooler plasmas , si ,",
    "s , and fe fluorescence and recombination occurs when an x - ray source illuminates nearby neutral material .",
    "fe emission lines provide powerful diagnostics of non - equilibrium ionization due to inner shell k - shell transitions from fe xvii  xxiv@xcite .    the sxs uniquely performs high - resolution spectroscopy of extended sources .",
    "in contrast to a grating , the spectral resolution of the calorimeter is unaffected by source s angular size because it is non - dispersive .",
    "for all sources with angular extent larger than 30  arcsec , chandra meg energy resolution is degraded compared with that of a ccd ; the energy resolution of the xmm - newton rgs is similarly degraded for sources with angular extent @xmath1325 arcsec .",
    "sxs therefore makes possible high - resolution spectroscopy of sources inaccessible to current grating instruments .    in order to obtain a good performance for bright sources , a filter wheel ( fw ) assembly , which includes a wheel with selectable filters and a set of modulated x - ray sources ,",
    "are provided by sron and univ . of geneva .",
    "it will be used at a distance of 90 cm from the detector .",
    "the fw is able to rotate a suitable filter into the beam to optimize the quality of the data , depending on the source characteristics@xcite .",
    "in addition to the filters , a set of on - off - switchable x - ray calibration sources , using light sensitive photo - cathode , will be implemented . with these calibration sources ,",
    "it is possible to calibrate the energy scale with a typical 1@xmath142 ev accuracy , and will allow proper gain and linearity calibration of the detector in flight .",
    "x - ray sensitive silicon charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) are key detectors for x - ray astronomy .",
    "the low background and high energy resolution achieved with the xis / suzaku clearly show that the x - ray ccd can also play a very important role in the astro - h mission .",
    "the soft x - ray imaging system will consist of an imaging mirror and a ccd camera , ( soft x - ray telescope ( sxt - i ) , soft x - ray imager ( sxi ) ) and the cooling system@xcite . fig .",
    "[ sxi - outlook ] shows a schematic drawing of the sxi .    in order to cover the soft x - ray band below 12  kev ,",
    "the sxi will use next generation hamamatsu ccd chips with a thick depletion layer of 200 @xmath5 m , low noise , and almost no cosmetic defects .",
    "the sxi features a large fov and covers a 38@xmath638  arcmin@xmath15 region on the sky , complementing the smaller fov of the sxs calorimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ] ) .",
    "a mechanical cooler ensures a long operational life at @xmath14120  @xmath16c . the quantum efficiency is better than the one achieved in suzaku xis over the entire 0.3@xmath1412 kev bandpass .",
    "the imaging mirror has a 5.6-m focal length , and a diameter of 45  cm .",
    "the nominal aim point will be placed at the center of sxs field of view , which is 4.3 arcmin offset from the sxi center .                  the hard x - ray imaging system onboard astro - h consists of two identical mirror - detector pairs ( hxt and hxi ) .",
    "the hxt has conical - foil mirrors with depth - graded multilayer reflecting surfaces that provide efficient reflection over 580  kev energy range@xcite .",
    "the effective area of the hxt is maximized for a long focal length .",
    "a depth - graded multilayer mirror reflects x - rays not only by total external reflection but also by the bragg reflection . in order to obtain a high reflectivity up to 80  kev , the hxts consist of a stack of multilayers with different sets of periodic length and number of layer pairs with a platinum / carbon coating .",
    "the technology of a hard x - ray focusing mirror has already been proven by the balloon programs infoc@xmath5s ( 2001 , 2004)@xcite , heft ( 2004)@xcite and sumit ( 2006)@xcite and very recently with the nustar satellite@xcite .",
    "recent test of the first flight mirror have validated the hxt design , achieving a collecting area of 174 @xmath17 at 30 kev for one telescope , with a focal length of 12 m.    the non - imaging instruments flown so far were essentially limited to studies of sources with 10100  kev fluxes of @xmath104 @xmath6 10@xmath1810@xmath19  erg  @xmath20s@xmath21 , at best .",
    "this limitation is due to the presence of high un - rejected backgrounds from particle events and cosmic x - ray radiation , which increasingly dominate above 10  kev .",
    "imaging , and especially focusing instruments have two tremendous advantages .",
    "firstly , the volume of the focal plane detector can be made much smaller than for non - focusing instruments , thus reducing the absolute background level since the background flux generally scales with the size of the detector .",
    "secondly , the residual background , often time - variable , can be measured simultaneously with the source , and can be reliably subtracted . for these reasons ,",
    "a focusing hard x - ray telescope in conjunction with an imaging detector sensitive for hard x - ray photons is the appropriate choice to achieve a breakthrough in sensitivity for the field of high energy astronomy .",
    "in addition to the improvement of sensitivity , the hxi provides a true imaging capability which enable us to study spatial distributions of hard x - ray emission .",
    "the hxi sensor consists of four layers of 0.5  mm thick double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dssd ) and one layer of 0.75  mm thick cdte imaging detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hxi])@xcite . in this configuration ,",
    "soft x - ray photons below @xmath7 20 kev are absorbed in the si part ( dssd ) , while hard x - ray photons above @xmath7 20 kev go through the si part and are detected by a newly developed cdte double sided cross - strip detector .",
    "the low energy spectrum , obtained with si , is less contaminated by the background due to activation in heavy material , such as cd and te .",
    "the dssds cover the energy below 30  kev while the cdte strip detector covers the 2080  kev band .",
    "each dssd has a size of 3.2@xmath63.2  @xmath8 and a thickness of 0.5  mm , resulting in 2  mm in total thickness , the same as that of the pin detector of the hxd onboard suzaku .",
    "a cdte strip detector has a size of 3.2@xmath63.2  @xmath8 and a thickness of 0.75  mm .",
    "in addition to the increase of efficiency , the stack configuration and individual readout provide information on the interaction depth .",
    "this depth information is very useful to reduce the background in space applications , because we can expect that low energy x - rays interact in the upper layers and , therefore , it is possible to reject the low energy events detected in lower layers .",
    "moreover , since the background rate scales with the detector volume , low energy events collected from the first few layers in the stacked detector have a high signal to background ratio , in comparison with events obtained from a monolithic detector with a thickness equal to the sum of all layers .    in the energy band above 10 kev , the number of photons from the source decreases and the detector background becomes the major limitations of its sensitivity . since a significant fraction of the background events originate from interactions of the cosmic - ray with the detector structure ,",
    "a tight active shield to reject cosmic - ray induced events is critical .",
    "fast timing response of the silicon strip detector and cdte strip detector allows us to place the entire detector inside a very deep well of an active shield made of bgo ( bi@xmath22ge@xmath23o@xmath24 ) scintillators .",
    "the signal from the bgo shield is used to reject background events . the bgo scintillator crystal , with its high density and high absorbing power , is commonly used as a material for anti coincidence shields in recent hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray instruments , such as integral and suzaku / hxd . in astro- h / hxi and sgd , a 3 - 4 cm thick bgo crystal is employed .",
    "with this thickness , it can not only tag the cosmic - rays , but also reduce the number of protons hitting the detector material ( e.g. , cdte ) by its passive shielding and hence it reduces the background .      highly sensitive observations in the energy range above the hxt / hxi bandpass are crucial to study the spectrum of x - rays arising from accelerated particles and black holes . in order to extend the energy coverage to the soft @xmath25-ray region up to 600kev , the soft gamma - ray detector ( sgd )",
    "will be implemented as a non - focusing detector onboard astro - h@xcite .",
    "the sgd measures soft @xmath25-rays via reconstruction of the compton scattering in the compton camera , covering an energy range of @xmath26kev with sensitivity at @xmath27kev of more than 10 times that of the suzaku  hard x - ray detector .",
    "it outperforms previous soft-@xmath25-ray instruments in background rejection capability by adopting a new concept of narrow - fov compton telescope@xcite .    in order to lower the background dramatically and thus to improve the sensitivity as compared to the hxd of suzaku",
    ", the design combines a stack of si and cdte pixel detectors to form a compton camera ( si / cdte compton camera)@xcite . the telescope is then mounted inside the bottom of a well - type active shield . above @xmath740  kev",
    ", each valid event is required to interact twice in the stacked detector , once by compton scattering in a stack of si strip detectors , and then by photo - absorption in the cdte part ( compton mode ) .",
    "once the locations and energies of the two interactions are measured , the compton kinematics allows the calculation of the energy and direction ( as a cone in the sky ) of the incident @xmath25-ray .",
    "the major advantage of employing a narrow fov is that the direction of incident @xmath25-rays is constrained to be inside the fov .",
    "if the compton cone domes not intercept the fov , we can reject the event as background .",
    "most of the background can be rejected by requiring this condition@xcite .    as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : sgd_concept ] , the detector consists of 32 layers of 0.6  mm thick si pad detectors and eight layers of cdte pixellated detectors with a thickness of 0.75  mm .",
    "the sides are also surrounded by two layers of cdte pixel detectors .",
    "the opening angle provided by the bgo shield is @xmath710  degrees at 500  kev . as compared to the hxd ,",
    "the shield part is made compact by adopting the newly developed avalanche photo - diode .",
    "an additional pcusn collimator restricts the field of view of the telescope to 30 for photons below 100 kev to minimize the flux due to the cosmic x - ray background in the fov .",
    "these modules are then arrayed to provide the required area .",
    "the effective area of the sgd is @xmath1020  @xmath8 at 100  kev in the compton mode .",
    "it should be noted that when the compton condition is not used , the stacked dssd can be used as a standard photo - absorption type detector with the total thickness @xmath720  mm of silicon .",
    "the detector then covers energies above 10  kev as a collimated - type @xmath25-ray detector .",
    "since the scattering angle of gamma - rays can be measured via reconstruction of the compton scattering in the compton camera , the sgd is capable of measuring polarization of celestial sources brighter than a few @xmath6 1/100 of the crab nebula , polarized above @xmath7 10 % .",
    "this capability is expected to yield polarization measurements in several celestial objects , providing new insights into properties of soft gamma - ray emission processes@xcite .",
    "last year , the technology behind the sgd was proved in measurements of the distribution of cs-137 in the environment of fukushima@xcite .",
    "in addition to showing that the sgd technology works as designed ` in the field' the use of the si / cdte compton camera provided crucial information in understanding how the fall out from the 2011 nuclear accident was distributed .",
    "astro - h is in many ways similar to suzaku in terms of orbit , pointing , and tracking capabilities , although the mass is considerably larger ( the total mass at launch will be 2700  kg , nearly double suzaku s 1700 kg ) .",
    "astro - h will be launched into a circular orbit with altitude of 500600  km , and inclination of 31  degrees .",
    "science operations will be similar to those of suzaku , with pointed observation of each target until the integrated observing time is accumulated , and then slewing to the next target .",
    "a typical observation will require a few @xmath6 100  ksec integrated exposure time .",
    "all instruments are co - aligned and will operate simultaneously .",
    "the current plan is to use the first three months for check - out and start the pv phase with observations proprietary to the astro - h team .",
    "guest observing time will start from 10 months after the launch . about 75% of the satellite time will be devoted to go observations after the pv phase is completed .",
    "we are planning to implement key - project type observations in conjunction with the go observation time .",
    "the spectroscopic capability of x - ray micro - calorimeters is unique in x - ray astronomy , since no other previously or currently operating spectrometers could achieve comparable high energy resolution , high quantum efficiency , and spectroscopy for spatially extended sources at the same time .",
    "imaging spectroscopy with the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) of extended sources can reveal line broadening and doppler shifts due to turbulent or bulk velocities .",
    "this capability enables the determination of the level of turbulent pressure support in clusters , snr ejecta dispersal patterns , the structure of agn and starburst winds , and the spatially dependent abundance pattern in clusters and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the sxs can also measure the optical depths of resonance absorption lines , from which the degree and spatial extent of turbulence can be inferred .",
    "additionally , the sxs can reveal the presence of relatively rare elements in snrs and other sources through its high sensitivity to low equivalent width emission lines .",
    "the low sxs background ensures that the observations of almost all line - rich objects will be photon limited rather than background limited .",
    "the imaging capabilities at high x - ray energies will open a new era in high spatial - resolution studies of astrophysical sources of non - thermal emission above 10 kev , probed simultaneously with lower energy imaging spectroscopy .",
    "this will enable us to track the evolution of active galaxies with accretion flows which are heavily obscured , in order to accurately assess their contribution to black hole growth over cosmological time scale .",
    "it will also uniquely allow mapping of the spatial extent of the hard x - ray emission in diffuse sources , thus tracing the sites of cosmic ray acceleration in structures ranging in size from megaparsecs , such as clusters of galaxies , down to parsecs , such as young supernova remnants@xcite .",
    "those studies will be complementary to the sxs measurements : observing the hard x - ray synchrotron emission will allow a study of the most energetic particles , thus revealing the details of particle acceleration mechanisms in supernova remnants , while the high resolution sxs data on the gas kinematics of the remnant will constrain the energy input into the accelerators .",
