    "the very first successfully imaged exoplanet is fomalhaut b @xcite .",
    "the fomalhaut system consists of a young main - sequence star of spectral type a4 , fomalhaut a , and there are two other physically bound stars in this system , fomalhaut b , which is of spectral type k , and fomalhaut c , which is of spectral type m. both are located at very wide distances from the primary star , at ca",
    ".  100  corresponding to ca .  750  au .",
    "fomalhaut a is located at a distance of 7.5  pc from the sun .",
    "it is surrounded by a debris disk that has been imaged in the optical and in the infrared .",
    "repeated observations performed with the coronograph onboard _ hst _ at red optical wavelengths revealed an object that appeared to be moving on an orbit in the same plane as the debris disk with an orbital distance of ca .",
    "100  au ; this object was called fomalhaut b. an exoplanet at that distance to the host star is expected to be cold , and respective models yielded that the object likely has a mass roughly similar to that of jupiter @xcite .",
    "however , observations at other wavelengths yielded surprising results .",
    "the planet was repeatedly detected at optical and near - infrared wavelengths of around 6000 and 8100  @xcite , but observations at even longer wavelengths , where the exoplanet is expected to be brighter , yielded strong upper limits that were incompatible with typical exoplanetary model spectra @xcite .",
    "even more confusingly , fomalhaut b was detected at blue optical wavelengths ( ca .",
    "4400 ) , where it should have been very dim @xcite .",
    "recent detections at optical wavelengths also revealed that the best - fit orbit of this object is not , as previously thought , aligned with the debris disk ; instead , the object seems to be on a disk - crossing orbit @xcite .",
    "several possible explanations have been brought forward to explain the surprising spectral shape of this object , including a planetary accretion disk around a jupiter - mass planet , explaining the blue excess by reflection , but not explaining the out - of - disk orbit @xcite ; a small hot planet with a very large cloud of planetesimals , explaining the brightness and misaligned orbit without producing unobserved disk perturbations , but not explaining how it arrived there since no scattering objects of sufficient mass are available @xcite ; and an icy dust cloud without a core , explaining the brightness , but being implausible in terms of age estimates @xcite .",
    "none of these hypotheses is fully consistent with the object properties observed so far .        given that the latest observations of relative motion observed between fomalhaut a and fomalhaut b do not support an in - disk orbit of the planet candidate , one should consider the possibility that fomalhaut b might be a background object that just happens to pass by fomalhaut  a at a close projected distance .",
    "this has recently been discussed by @xcite .",
    "the faintness of fomalhaut b at optical wavelengths ( ca .  25 mag ) and the blue - leaning sed constrain what kind of object it can be .",
    "it can not be an ordinary star , since any star with such a blue sed would be intrinsically bright .",
    "to match fomalhaut b s faintness , the hypothetical star would have to be so far away that substantial reddening caused by the interstellar medium would occur , so that the colors would not fit any more .",
    "it also can not be a white dwarf ; white dwarfs typically have absolute visible magnitudes of 1015 mag @xcite . placing a white dwarf at a distance of 0.55 kpc to match",
    "the brightness would mean that the projected 2d spatial velocity of the white dwarf would have to be unrealistically large in order to fit the observed trajectory of fomalhaut  b @xcite .",
    "this leaves the possibility that fomalhaut b may be a neutron star .",
    "neutron stars have absolute visual magnitudes of ca .  2225 mag , depending on temperature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "the apparent magnitude of fomalhaut b is ca .  25 in the visual , so an old and cool neutron star at ca .",
    "10 pc distance or a somewhat hotter one farther away would generally fit the observed apparent brightness of the object .",
    "neutron stars start out with surface temperatures of several mk after formation and cool over time scales of megayears to temperatures of around 100000 k @xcite .",
    "several nearby thermally emitting neutron stars have been detected in x - rays with sufficient signal to noise to allow spectral fitting , and those neutron stars typically display surface temperatures of 500000 to 1000000  k ; however , they are estimated to be rather young with @xmath5  myr @xcite .",
    "an older , cooler neutron stars will still look blue at optical wavelengths , matching the few observational detections available so far for fomalhaut  b. the emission from an old neutron star would peak in the far - uv , however the brightness of the central star fomalhaut a at optical and uv wavelengths makes such observations difficult and requires sophisticated subtraction methods for the stellar point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "however , in soft x - rays , where the hard tail of the neutron star spectrum may be detectable , a star with the mass of fomalhaut is expected to be x - ray dark , making x - ray observations a good opportunity to study the object fomalhaut  b.",
    "the fomalhaut system has been imaged in x - rays previously , albeit spatially unresolved , with the _ einstein _ and _ rosat _ observatories .",
    "the deepest archival observation was performed with a _",
    "pspc pointing in 1992 , and we present that data set shortly in the following section . we have performed a new , deeper x - ray observation which can spatially resolve fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b using _ chandra _ s hrc - i instrument and present that data in detail in section  [ newobs ] .",
    "_ rosat _ was a space telescope that operated from 1990 to 1999 , observing the soft x - ray sky @xcite .",
    "its pspc camera @xcite provided soft x - ray images with a spatial resolution of 25 arsec ( full - width half maximum of the point spread function ) in an energy range of 0.12.4  kev .",
    "the fomalhaut system was observed in a pspc pointing for 6.3  ks in 1992 .",
    "the spatial resolution of _ rosat _ s pspc is not sufficient to resolve the fomalhaut system since the spatial separation between fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b is 13.8 arcsec .",
    "the fomalhaut system is undetected in x - rays by _",
    "rosat_. @xcite give an upper limit on the x - ray count rate of 0.0066  cts / s for this observation .",
    "in the interest of a consistent analysis of the _ rosat _ and _ chandra _ data , we re - analyzed the data set and derive a 3@xmath6 upper limit on the count rate of 0.008  cts / s .",
    "the flux that corresponds to this upper limit depends on the assumed spectrum of the undetected source , and we discuss this in more detail in section  [ results ] . assuming a black - body spectrum with a temperature of 100,000  k , we calculate an upper limit on the x - ray flux of @xmath7  erg@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "we used the webpimms count rate simulator for this @xcite , which is accessible at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tools/w3pimms/w3pimms.pl .",
    "we took into account that the boron filter was used during this _ rosat _ observations , which reduces the throughput at soft x - ray energies by ca .",
    "we performed an x - ray pointing with _",
    "s hrc - i @xcite with a duration of 32.7  ks .",
    "details of the observation are given in table  [ xrayobs ] .",
    "we used the standard data analysis tools of _ chandra _ s _ ciao _ software , version 4.7 @xcite .",
    "specifically , we extracted counts from a source detect cell placed on the nominal positions of fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b , each with a radius of @xmath8 .",
    "this was compared to a background signal which was extracted from a source - free region on the chip with a radius of @xmath9 .",
    "since hrc - i provides no useful energy resolution for the collected x - ray photons ( in contrast to other x - ray instruments onboard _ chandra _ ) , no energy filtering was performed .",
    "the extracted photons therefore can come from the full range of energies to which hrc - i is sensitive , i.e.  0.0810  kev .",
    "we show the extracted image collected with hrc - i in fig .",
    "[ hrcimagezoomed ] .",
    "the indicated regions show the positions of fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b , as well as our chosen background region .",
    "the background region contains 294 photon counts , while the source detect cells for fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b contain 6 and 7 photon counts , respectively .",
    "given that the background extraction region has an area 100 larger than the individual source detect cells , we would expect a pure background signal of 2.94 in a source detect cell .",
    ".x - ray observation parameters for fomalhaut  b. [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     using poissonian counting statistics , a signal of 9  counts in a detect cell would correspond to a @xmath10 excess , i.e.  a probability smaller than 0.03% that this signal would be detected as a random fluctuation of the background .",
    "however , the signal in the detect cells is lower than that , meaning that a significant count excess is not detected for either fomalhaut or fomalhaut  b. has 33 photon counts in a @xmath8 detect cell and is significantly detected .",
    "no matches were found for this source position in major catalogs at various wavelengths , so that we can make no further statements about the nature of this source .",
    "] we therefore adopt a signal of 9  counts counts and , given the exposure time of 32691.2  s , a count rate of 0.00028  cts / s as the upper limit for fomalhaut and fomalhaut  b in the full hrc energy band of 0.0810  kev .",
    "what we are specifically interested in is an upper limit on the x - ray flux and x - ray luminosity of fomalhaut  b and fomalhaut .",
    "often this is done by spectral fitting to model the energy sensitivity of the detector and derive the actual source flux . however , since the _ hrc - i _ instrument has virtually no intrinsic energy resolution , one needs to find an appropriate counts - to - energy conversion factor for the observation .",
    "this conversion factor will depend on the underlying x - ray spectrum one assumes for a source , because _ hrc - i _ has different sensitivities to photons at the upper and lower end of the energy range it is sensitive to . to give the reader a rough idea , the effective area of _ hrc - i _",
    "starts at 0.08  kev with a few @xmath11 and rises in several steps to ca .  200  @xmath11 at 1  kev ( with a narrow downward spike around 0.3  kev due to an absorption edge of carbon residuals on the mirror assembly ) , and decreases again at energies higher than 1  kev .",
    "therefore a spectrum peaking at soft energies where the effective area is small will lead to a small number of counts being detected , whereas a spectrum with the same flux , but peaking at harder x - ray energies where _ hrc - i _ has a larger effective area , will lead to more counts being detected .",
    "neutron stars emit strongly in the far - uv and in soft x - rays . following @xcite",
    ", we will now explore the hypothesis of fomalhaut  b being a neutron star in the near fore- or background of the fomalhaut disk , given the new observations we performed with _",
    "chandra_.      to determine the appropriate upper limit to the x - ray flux of fomalhaut  b from the upper limit on the x - ray count rate , one needs to assume some sort of underlying hypothetical source spectrum .",
    "neutron stars are generally soft x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "soon after their formation their surface cools down to a few mk , and reaches temperatures of a few @xmath12  k and lower after several million years @xcite .",
    "we can derive an appropriate count - to - energy conversion factor for _ chandra _ hrc - i by using a blackbody spectral model in webpimms . using a hotter neutron star model with a surface temperature of 1  mk over an x - ray energy range of 0.0810",
    "kev yields a conversion factor of @xmath13  ergs@xmath2s@xmath3count@xmath3 for hrc - i ; using a colder neutron star model with @xmath14  k yields a conversion factor of @xmath15  ergs@xmath2s@xmath3count@xmath3 , i.e.  larger by a factor of about five .",
    "an upper limit on the x - ray flux will therefore depend on the assumed surface temperature of the neutron star .",
    "fortunately , this dependence and the actual fitting of possible spectral models including the optical data are ` self - correcting ' : say we assume a surface temperature that is too high .",
    "this will lead to a small conversion factor , meaning a very low , i.e.  very restrictive , upper limit on the x - ray flux .",
    "this in turn will force us to fit the data with a rather cool neutron star model , because a hot neutron star would be too bright in x - rays and therefore violate the upper limit .",
    "the mismatch between our initial assumption for the surface temperature and the derived fit will indicate that the assumption was not correct . similarly , assuming a neutron star that is too cold will lead to a large conversion factor , a non - restrictive upper limit on the x - ray flux , and therefore allow the data to be fit with a hotter neutron star . finally , a roughly correct assumption about the surface temperature will lead to a matching temperature in the fit .",
    "having gone through this exercise , we assume a cool surface temperature of @xmath14  k for fomalhaut  b as a neutron star and use a counts - to - energy conversion factor of @xmath15  ergs@xmath2s@xmath3count@xmath3 .",
    "the upper limit on the count rate of 0.00028  cts / s therefore corresponds to an upper limit on the x - ray flux of @xmath16  ergs@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "we calculate the upper limit on the average flux density for the wavelength range covered by _ hrc - i _ , i.e.  0.08 - 10  kev , to be @xmath17  ergs@xmath2s@xmath3@xmath3 .",
    "fomalhaut  b has been detected by several groups in the optical and the near - infrared .",
    "some detections in the optical have been reported to have significantly differing fluxes when taking the reported error bars at face value ; however , given the sophisticated image analysis necessary to detect fomalhaut  b s emission at all , we consider it is possible that the actual flux errors may be larger than initially reported .",
    "upper limits at longer wavelengths have been derived from observations as well .",
    "@xcite have given a summary on available pre-2015 detections and upper limits , and we give an updated overview of the available data in table  [ allobs ] , including a new data point in the infrared by @xcite and the x - ray flux upper limits derived in this work .",
    "we can use those data sets to constrain an assumed neutron star spectrum for fomalhaut  b. one might in principle assume a reddening effect on the spectrum occurs from dust absorption along the line of sight between fomalhaut  b and the observer . however , interstellar absorption is negligible for nearby objects .",
    "dust absorption from the fomalhaut disk is also unlikely to produce significant reddening : @xcite observed the fomalhaut disk at 350  @xmath18 m and modelled a reddening of 0.005  mag at a wavelength of 24  @xmath18 m from those observations . from this",
    "we can extrapolate , using appropriate conversions from the 24  micron band to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands @xcite , that the reddening in the @xmath20 band will be ca .",
    "0.17  mag . this is smaller than the rms scatter of the fomalhaut  b detections in the observed optical bands , which is of the order of 0.3  mag ( see table  [ allobs ] ) , and we therefore regard a potential dust reddening due to the fomalhaut disk as irrelevant to our further analysis",
    ".      the emission from a neutron star in its simplest form can be described by a blackbody spectrum .",
    "it has been shown that often neutron stars are more accurately described by adding an additional harder x - ray component to the spectrum .",
    "physically , this is likely due to hot polar caps covering a certain fraction of the neutron star surface ( see @xcite and references therein ) or the presence of a pulsar wind nebula @xcite ; those harder x - ray spectral components are typically described by a power - law or a thermal spectrum .",
    "however , as the simplest possible model , we are assuming a single temperature blackbody component for the neutron star surface .",
    "furthermore , we assume a typical radius of the hypothetical neutron star of 10  km @xcite .",
    "any discrepancy to this assumed radius will only cause a slightly smaller or larger distance to the object in the spectral fit .",
    "we produce a least - squares fit of a blackbody model to the available data , using the detections of fomalhaut  b at optical wavelengths and treating the chandra upper limit as a detection data point for the sake of the fit .",
    "the other upper limits in the optical and ir do not restrict the fit ( see figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the best fit is found for a blackbody temperature of 91000  k and a distance of 13.5  pc .",
    "the constraint on the temperature is driven by the x - ray upper limit , while the detections in the optical and near - infrared pinpoint the distance for a given temperature .",
    "we indicate the effect of changing the temperature for a given distance ( the latter being interchangeable with the radius of the object ) in figure  [ spectra ] ; a closer distance moves the spectrum upwards , while a cooler temperature moves the spectrum to the lower right according to wien s displacement law .",
    "this means that one can not assume a neutron star hotter than 91000  k and place it at a larger distance , because such a model would either lie below the optical data points while satisfying the x - ray upper limit , or be a reasonable fit to the optical data while violating the x - ray upper limit .",
    "note that the best - fitting neutron star model is found for the case where the object is indeed detected at the x - ray upper limit , which it is not .",
    "therefore , if fomalhaut  b is a neutron star , it has to be cooler than 91000  k and closer than 13.5  pc .    additionally , using the largest distance estimate of 13.5  pc",
    ", we can convert the upper limit to fomalhaut  b s x - ray flux into an upper limit to its x - ray luminosity .",
    "we calculate this upper limit to be @xmath21  erg / s .",
    "the central star fomalhaut is an intermediate - mass star of spectral type a4v .",
    "massive stars ( spectral types o and early b ) drive winds which produce x - rays through shocks , while low - mass stars ( mid - f to late m ) emit in x - rays due to their magnetically heated coronae .",
    "stars in the intermediate mass regime , i.e. of spectral types mid - b to early f , typically do not show x - ray emission , with the exception of the chemically peculiar ap / bp stars . among regular ,",
    "i.e.  non - chemically - peculiar a - type stars , only a handful have been detected in x - rays .",
    "those rare examples display weak and very soft x - ray emission that can be described by a coronal plasma with dominant temperature components around 1  mk in the case of the a5v star beta pictoris @xcite and temperature components in the range from 1 - 4  mk in the case of the a7v star altair @xcite .",
    "other x - ray observations of a - type stars have not led to detections @xcite , with the exception of hr  8799 , which is listed by simbad as an a6 star , but was shown by @xcite to be a peculiar type of early - f star with coronal emission , therefore not being representative for the intermediate - mass stellar regime .    in our observation ,",
    "fomalhaut is undetected in x - rays , with an upper limit to the count rate of 0.00028  cts / s . using a soft coronal plasma model with a temperature of 1  mk to derive the appropriate counts - to - energy conversion factor ( @xmath22  erg / s / count ) , this upper limit corresponds to an upper limit to the x - ray flux of @xmath23  ergs@xmath3@xmath2 and , using fomalhaut s distance of 7.7  pc , an x - ray luminosity of @xmath4  erg / s over the energy range of 0.0810  kev . converting this to the more regularly used energy range of 0.22  kev",
    ", we derive an upper limit of @xmath24  erg / s .",
    "the ratio of x - ray and bolometric luminosity , often used as an activity indicator for stars that can display magnetic activity @xcite , is @xmath25 for the energy range of 0.0810  kev and @xmath26 for the energy range of 0.22  kev ; a bolometric luminosity of @xmath27 times the solar bolometric luminosity , i.e.  @xmath28erg@xmath1@xmath2@xmath1s@xmath3@xcite was adopted for fomalhaut .",
    "fomalhaut is therefore a star for which magnetic activity is present at vanishingly low levels , if at all .",
    "to set this into context , this is a very restrictive upper limit , similar to the upper limit derived with _",
    "s acis and hrc instruments for the a0v star vega , which has been observed to be @xmath29  erg / s @xcite .",
    "our non - detection of fomalhaut  b in x - rays places strong constraints on the neutron star hypothesis . in order to fit the available data with a single - temperature blackbody model and a typical neutron star radius of 10  km",
    ", the hypothetical neutron star would need to be colder than ca .",
    "90000  k , i.e.  it would need to be very old with @xmath30  myr according to typical cooling models @xcite , and need to be located at a distance closer than 13.5  pc .  years , consistent with an old age of the hypothetical neutron star .",
    "] this would make fomalhaut  b the nearest known neutron star to the solar system , and furthermore an extremely old and cool one .",
    "if the neutron star radius was very small , for example 2  km , the temperature restriction would still hold , but the upper limit on its distance would only be ca .  0.5  pc . to set this into context ,",
    "we can compare fomalhaut  b to the extremely cool and old neutron star reported by @xcite .",
    "they derive an upper limit on temperature and black - body luminosity in the soft x - ray band of @xmath31  k and @xmath32  erg / s for the neutron star j18401419 , which is located at a distance of 900  pc .",
    "obviously , the close distance to the hypothetical neutron star for fomalhaut  b is a main driver of the very low upper limit we have derived .",
    "however , it is still noteworthy that this would be the most near - by and coldest neutron star known , i.e.  even with a neutron star explanation for fomalhaut  b s surprising colours , we would be facing a very unusual scenario for _ detected _ neutrino stars .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in general one can expect old and cool neutron stars to be quite common from supernova occurrence rates in the milky way ( see for example @xcite p.269 ) .",
    "however , since they are dim objects at all wavelengths , detecting those old and cool neutron stars is extremely challenging ; if fomalhaut  b truly is a neutron star , it would be the coldest one detected so far .",
    "while a neutron star scenario is not completely ruled out , it is worthwhile to compare it to a scenario in which the detected emission of fomalhaut  b is reflected light from the central star , and the reflecting object would be an object residing within the fomalhaut disk ( see for example @xcite ) . as a rough guideline , we show a blackbody spectrum with appropriate parameters to approximate an a4v star like fomalhaut ( @xmath33  k @xcite and @xmath34 @xcite , and from that calculated @xmath35  cm ) in fig .",

    "indeed , the reflected starlight hypothesis matches the optical data point in the blue ( @xmath37   ) and in the near - infrared ( @xmath38   ) better than the neutron star models which over - estimate the blue part and under - estimate the near - infrared part .",
    "we can perform a rough estimate of what size such a reflecting object would need to have to yield this observed flux . assuming the reflector is in the fomalhaut disk ( i.e.  at a distance of 115  au to the central star ) and has perfect reflectivity , we know that in order to reflect @xmath36 of the starlight the reflector needs to have @xmath36 times the area of a sphere with a radius of @xmath39  au ( as this sphere would encompass the complete flux of fomalhaut ) .",
