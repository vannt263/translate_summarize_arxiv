    "the total stellar mass is a fundamental parameter for any galaxy .",
    "not only do many other galaxy properties vary with stellar mass , but an accurate measure of stellar mass is required to probe the dark matter content ( i.e. the total mass minus the stellar mass ) in a galaxy . however , measuring the total stellar mass is problematic , even once the total luminosity has been accurately measured .",
    "for example , a common approach is to measure the total luminosity of a galaxy at near - ir wavelengths for which the light mostly comes from old stars that dominate the mass , and the effects of dust are much reduced compared to optical wavelengths .",
    "a typical approach is to use the full - sky ground - based near - ir imaging of the 2mass survey ( jarrett et al .",
    "however it has been reported that the 2mass reduction pipeline systematically underestimates the total luminosity and size of large , nearby galaxies due to a truncation of their surface brightness profiles ( schombert & smith 2012 ; scott et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the 3.6@xmath0 m band of the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) or the 3.4@xmath0 m band of the wise space telescope ( wright et al .",
    "such wavelengths are particularly well suited to measure the stellar masses of galaxies . for example , norris et al .",
    "( 2014 ) concluded that photometry from wise can _  ... provide extremely simple , yet robust stellar mass tracers for dust free older stellar populations ...",
    "\"_. this is because the 3.43.6@xmath0 m light from galaxies is dominated by the light from old stars , and it is less effected by variations in the star formation history than shorter wavelengths .",
    "although intermediate - aged stars , hot dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may contribute to the emission at 3.6@xmath0 m , these sources are negligible for most early - type galaxies which are dominated by old stellar populations ( meidt et al .",
    "2012 ; querejeta et al .",
    "2015 ) .    here",
    "we use 3.6@xmath0 m imaging from the spitzer space telescope .",
    "the 3.6@xmath0 m mass - to - light ratio ( m / l@xmath4 ) has virtually no dependence on metallicity , and only a very small dependence on age for old stellar ages .",
    "we use the latest single - burst stellar population models ( rck et al .",
    "2015 ) which are based on empirical mid - infrared stellar spectra ( cushing et al . 2005 ; rayner et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these models cover a range of metallicity , ages and imf slopes .",
    "they are shown to reproduce well the mid - infrared colours of early - type galaxies . for a kroupa imf ,",
    "these models give m / l@xmath4 @xmath5 0.8 for a stellar population mean age of 9 gyr , with a variation between different isochrones , i.e. from basti and padova , of @xmath50.05 . for a metallicity range of [ fe / h ] = 0.4 to solar ( i.e. typical of the mean values for massive early - type galaxies )",
    ", the variation is insignificant at @xmath50.02 .",
    "we note that the flexible stellar population synthesis ( fsps ; conroy & gunn 2010 ) models with agb circumstellar dust included ( villaume et al . 2015 ) also give m / l@xmath4 @xmath50.8 for a 9 gyr old , moderately metal - rich population .",
    "meidt et al .",
    "( 2014 ) adopted a constant value of m / l@xmath4 = 0.6 for their s4 g sample , although their sample was dominated by late - type galaxies with younger mean ages on average .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios have a strong dependence on the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the m / l@xmath4 values quoted above refer to a kropua imf .",
    "salpeter and other imfs tend to have higher m / l@xmath4 values by a factor of @xmath51.5 - 3 ( rck et al .",
    "2015 ) , which would lead to larger stellar masses for a given 3.6@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "recent work indicates that the imf for early - type galaxies is skewed to low mass stars ( see e.g. ferre - mateu et al .",
    "2013 ; martin - navarro et al .",
    "2015 ; mcconnell et al .",
    "currently , it is not yet clear what is causing the imf variations nor whether these variations are confined to galaxy central regions , high metallicity regions or spheroids .",
    "here we adopt a kroupa imf for our global m / l@xmath4 but caution that the stellar masses for massive elliptical galaxies may need revising upwards .",
    "since m / l@xmath4 varies with stellar age , an age - appropriate ratio should be employed .",
    "here we adopt an age dependent mass - to - light ratio from the rck et al .",
    "( 2015 ) models using mean stellar ages from the literature .",
    "we assume a kroupa imf .",
    "the sluggs survey targets 25 nearby massive early - type galaxies in different environments and 3 so - called bonus galaxies ( brodie et al .",
    "we study the kinematics and metallicity of both the galaxy itself , and its system of globular clusters , to large galactocentric radii .",
    "the sample galaxies are chosen to cover a range of key parameters including stellar mass and physical size .",
    "until now , the approach in the sluggs survey to measure stellar mass has been to obtain the extinction - corrected k - band ( 2.2@xmath0 m ) magnitude from the 2mass extended galaxy catalog and apply the correction of scott et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for missing light .",
    "we then applied a constant m / l@xmath6 = 1 irrespective of stellar metallicity or age .",
    "a value of unity is simplistic , but a reasonable approximation for a very old stellar population with a kroupa imf ( bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the effective radii ( r@xmath7 ) of the sluggs galaxies are listed in brodie et al .",
    "( 2014 , b14 ) , which are based on cappellari et al .",
    "cappellari et al . used sizes from both optical and near - ir imaging .",
    "they noted that the near - ir sizes from the 2mass survey ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) for the largest , most massive galaxies appear to be systematically underestimated and they scaled - up their near - ir sizes to match the optical sizes on average .",
    "a recent study by van den bosch ( 2016 ) also found the 2mass survey to underestimate the sizes ( and total fluxes ) of nearby galaxies .",
    "accurate galaxy effective radii are important in order to compare galaxies on a similar relative scale .",
    "for example the sluggs survey and other integral field spectroscopy studies , derive kinematic profiles as a function of effective radii and measure properties such as specific angular momentum within 1 r@xmath7 ( arnold et al .",
    "2014 ; alabi et al .",
    "2015 ; foster et al .",
    "thus the photometric effective radii need to be accurate in order to correctly compare kinematic properties between different galaxies .",
    "effective radii , combined with accurate stellar masses , are needed to probe the dark matter fraction within a given multiple of r@xmath7 .",
    "the spitzer space telescope imaging presented here offers an opportunity to revisit the sizes and masses of the sluggs early - type galaxies .    in the next sections we present the 3.6@xmath0 m data from the spitzer space telescope and our methodology for deriving total magnitudes , stellar masses , and effective radii for 27 sluggs early - type galaxies .",
    "these new measurements are compared with literature values . in an appendix",
    "we list the measurements for six additional nearby early - type galaxies , which we include for the interested reader .",
    "here we use images from the irac instrument of the spitzer space telescope , which has a pixel scale of 1.22 arcsec over a 5.2 @xmath8 5.2 arcmin@xmath9 field - of - view .",
    "we have downloaded the latest ( july 2016 ) available 3.6@xmath0 m basic calibrated data frames from the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "these astronomical observation requests ( aors ) are detailed in appendix a ( for sluggs galaxies ) and c ( for non - sluggs galaxies ) .",
    "these data have been corrected for scattered light , dark current , flat - fielded and flux calibrated .",
    "the mopex package is used to assemble the long - exposure ( @xmath101 s ) frames into an image mosaic showing the field of view around each target galaxy .",
    "an example of the final mosaic for ngc 1407 is shown is fig . 1 .",
    "we follow a similar reduction procedure to that of savorgnan & graham ( 2016 , sg16 ) .",
    "thus when multiple pointings are available , an overlap correction is applied to create a uniform background level . using iraf",
    "we determine the sky background level and rms at multiple points on the outskirts of each mosaiced image .",
    "the sky values are averaged to give a final value for the sky background of each image , which is subtracted from the image .",
    "finally , bright stars and other unwanted objects are masked out of the mosaic .",
    "for further details see sg16",
    ".    unfortunately , the 3.6@xmath0 m data for the low - mass sluggs galaxy ngc 4474 are not useful for measuring the total light ( and hence mass ) or galaxy size . in this case , the galaxy is only partially visible as it is near the edge of the available spitzer pointing .",
    "we therefore adopt its stellar mass ( log m@xmath2 = 10.23 ) from its 2mass k - band magnitude and its effective radius ( r@xmath7 = 1.5 kpc ) from brodie et al .",
    "to measure the total light from each galaxy we model the galaxy in 2d using the iraf task _ ellipse _ and obtain the total magnitude of the galaxy model .",
    "the galaxy centre was initially allowed to vary , but if it varied by more than 1 pixel , we fixed it to the average central value .",
    "for a few galaxies ( i.e. ngc 4486 , 4594 , 5866 and 7457 ) we could not obtain a good galaxy model with a radially varying position angle ( pa ) and so in these cases we fixed the pa to a representative value based on the radial trend .",
    "the model extends in galactocentric radius until the integrated magnitude at that radius is less than 0.02 mag different from the previous ( penultimate ) radius .",
    "thus we effectively adopt the asymptotic total magnitude of the model galaxy .",
    "we estimate our combined photometric and systematic uncertainty to be @xmath11 0.05 mag .",
    "we do not correct our 3.6@xmath0 m magnitudes for galactic extinction ( which are less than 0.01 mag . ) .",
    "the total 3.6@xmath0 m magnitudes that we measure in the vega system , and other basic properties of the sluggs galaxies , are given in table 1 .",
