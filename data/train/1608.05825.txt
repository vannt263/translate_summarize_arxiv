    "<S> this is because , when @xmath128 , only @xmath6 and @xmath105 terms in eq.([pairing+ ] ) can be non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> however , these terms pair spin - up electrons while the spin - down electrons can not be paired . therefore , there are nodal points in the north and south poles when we have a closed 3d fermi surface . in general , </S>",

    "<S> the top view of the four nodal points in the northern hemisphere are shown in fig.[fg3]a . </S>",
    "<S> the four nodal points in the southern hemisphere are inversion partners of the four nodal points in fig.[fg3]a . due to the non - degenerate nodal points , </S>",

    "<S> the nodal points with opposite chiralities are connected by surface majorana arcs @xcite as depicted in figs.[fg3 ] b to c. fig.[fg3]b and fig.[fg3]c depict the majorana arcs on the @xmath119 and @xmath120-plane respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the chirality of a node is defined by the chern number of the fermi surface enclosing the node . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was suggested that pros@xmath3sb@xmath131 are chiral superconductors which has similar nodal structures @xcite .    in the special case of @xmath132 but with finite @xmath35 in eq.([pairing+ ] ) , the four nodal points in the northern hemisphere merge together in the north pole ( similarly for the four nodal points in the southern hemisphere ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in weyl nodes with double chirality . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , a recent experiment shows that the three fold rotational symmetry of nb - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 in the superconducting phase is also broken @xcite . </S>",
