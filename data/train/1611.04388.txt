    "the geometric interior of @xmath1 coincides with the usual notion of relative interior of a convex set ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",

    "since we are interested on the amount of information about the state that can be extracted in a statistical experiment , we can switch to a slightly more flexible mathematical description and ignore the specific outcomes of a measurement .",
