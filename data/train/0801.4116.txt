    "fu  orionis stars ( fuors ) are rare .",
    "classical fuors have been identified by large ( @xmath4 mag ) increases in brightness and luminosity followed by fading over decades , and only a few young stars have been confirmed as such , notably fu ori , v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg , v1735 cyg @xcite , v346 nor @xcite , and v733 cep @xcite .",
    "additionally , while in outburst , they exhibit optical and near - ir spectra similar to fu  orionis itself @xcite .",
    "the absorption line widths ( interpreted as rotational velocities ) and derived spectral types of fuors change with wavelength , varying from f or g in the visible to m type in the near - ir .",
    "their spectra also indicate supergiant or giant surface gravities .",
    "these characteristics have been modeled as arising from young stars with massive accretion disks , the latter dominating the spectra and luminosities of these objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the accretion disk model has been quite successful in explaining the basic visible - to - ir spectral features and energy distributions of fuors @xcite , although in detail there are still discrepancies @xcite .",
    "the only published ( and modeled ) high resolution near - ir spectra of fuors have been in the vicinity of the first vibrational overtone @xmath5 of co ( @xmath6 m ) , providing temperature and rotation information .",
    "new observations at other near - ir wavelengths may aid in determining the range of effective temperatures and surface gravities over which fuor spectral features arise in the near - ir , providing more constraints on applicable physical models .",
    "the general symmetry and relatively even spacing often seen in herbig - haro object knots strongly suggest that they are somehow linked to episodic outbursts from their parent star plus disk systems @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the sources of hh objects and fuor outbursts may possibly be related .",
    "@xcite found that five young stars associated with hh flows ( termed herbig - haro energy sources or hhens ) had low resolution k - band spectra that are very similar to those of fuors .",
    "if episodic outbursts do generally indicate fuor activity , then there may be many more young stars with fuor characteristics than the number predicted by extrapolating numbers from the few known classical fuors . in the following discussions , we use the term fuor - like star to indicate objects that have spectral similarities to the classical fuors , but for which no eruption has been witnessed @xcite .",
    "how similar are classical fuors and fuor - like stars ? both are young stars that are likely undergoing episodes of high accretion .",
    "however , their luminosities may be powered by different physical processes or they may be at different phases of their outburst and decay cycles .",
    "it is also important to understand how similar these objects are to embedded ( class  i ) protostars accreting at fairly high rates ( e.g. , @xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) and to investigate whether there are any spectral similarities between protostars , fuors , and fuor - like objects .",
    "also , do any of these objects show spectral characteristics similar to other young eruptive variables such as ex  lupi - type ( exors ) young stars ?",
    "exors undergo multiple short duration optical outbursts of 1  5  mag but have k or m dwarf optical spectra dominated by emission lines , much different from fuor spectra ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we believe that such fundamental questions can be addressed with new high resolution spectra .",
    "such spectra must cover near - ir wavelengths since many fuor - like stars are highly extinguished and can not be observed in visible light .",
    "the low resolution near - ir spectra of @xcite did show strong similarities between fuors and fuor - like objects , but those spectra were also consistent with giant stars .",
    "one object with such a near - ir spectrum in close proximity to a young star was recently found to be a background giant star @xcite . linking other young stars to fuors will improve our knowledge of the number and types of young stars with high accretion rates , and detailed modeling may reveal more information on physical structures and accretion mechanisms or processes .",
    "we have conducted a new near - ir spectroscopic study of fuors and fuor - like stars covering a relatively broad range of wavelengths near 2  @xmath2 m , including spectral features sensitive to both effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "we present these new data in @xmath9 the properties of the individual fuor - like stars are discussed in @xmath10 .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that the larger bandwidth near - ir spectra of fu  ori and v1057  cyg do share some similarities with the artificially broadened and veiled spectra of the m2 supergiant @xmath31 ori , but overall they appear to be more similar to the spectra of the fuor - like stars in figure  [ fig2 ] .",

    "the cross - correlations with the other stars do not have double - peaked structures , likely because of their large rotation velocities ( natural in irs  63 and artificially added in @xmath31  ori ) .",
    "we have computed cross - correlation functions of all fuor - like stars over the 2.2032.236  @xmath2 m wavelength interval using fu  ori ( keck spectrum ) , @xmath31  ori , hr  5150 ( m1.5  iii ) , gj  402 , and the protostar irs  63 as templates .",

    "this indicates that fuors and fuor - like stars have some spectral features in common with giants , dwarfs , or protostars .",

    "the significance of the cross - correlation of the two different fu  ori observations is very high ( @xmath46 ) but not infinite .",
    "the finite nature of this value is most likely due to the limited overlapping spectral range ( @xmath27 = 2.21942.2290  @xmath2 m ) of the 2 observations of fu  ori with different instrumentation .",

    "the near - ir @xmath47 colors of fuors and hhens have not previously been compared directly and these wavelengths encompass our spectra , so we present a near - ir color - color diagram of 15 of these objects in figure  [ fig4 ] ( including ones without spectra presented in this paper ) .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 colors in figure  [ fig4 ] were all computed from 2mass catalog data , and the plot shows that most of the hhens have colors that are consistent with either reddened classical t  tauri stars ( falling along the dashed t tauri locus ) or with reddened normal stars with ir excesses ; only hh354 irs has colors that are clearly inconsistent with ir excess .",
    "fu  ori , several fuors , and a few fuor - like stars also have colors consistent with reddened early - type stars ( early - type stars are near the origin of the plot ) .",
    "however , early - type stars are ruled out and the color degeneracy is broken by the fact that the fuors and fuor - like objects generally show strong near - ir co absorptions , consistent with late spectral types typical of t tauri stars .",
    "therefore most of the fuors and fuor - like hhens have near - ir colors consistent with having circumstellar disks",
    ". however , the large range of colors makes it difficult to differentiate regular stars , fuors , and t  tauri stars ( or protostars ) by their colors alone .",
    "this color range may be produced by some combination of local scattering produced by different amounts and distributions of circumstellar material as well as different object orientations ( i.e. , disk / envelope orientations ) .",
    "the similarity of the fuor and fuor - like spectra and their significant cross - correlations indicate that the spectral lines of these objects must form in physically similar environments .",
    "@xcite had also postulated this based on similarities of low resolution near - ir spectra , and the high resolution data presented in this paper confirm that the fuor - like hhens are more similar to fuors than dwarfs , giants , supergiants , or embedded protostars .    given the cross - correlation results , the near - ir spectra of fuor - like stars do not appear to be produced in normal stellar photospheres .",
    "the broad cross - correlation peaks indicate rotational velocities @xmath3  sin  @xmath50  km  s@xmath8 , much larger than measured for t  tauri stars or even the most rapidly spinning embedded protostars @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlations with late - type dwarfs and the embedded protostar irs  63 are also generally poor ( low significance ) , but they are somewhat better with late - type giants and supergiants ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the spectral features of fuor - like stars originate in cool regions with low surface gravities that differ from normal stellar photospheres , and the generally good cross - correlations with fuor spectra reinforce this .",
    "the strong co absorptions of the fuors and fuor - like stars ( figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) indicate relatively low effective temperatures , t@xmath51  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a giant or supergiant star of that effective temperature would have a radius greater than about 40 @xmath52 and a mass of approximately 6 @xmath53 or more .",
    "such stars have rotational breakup velocities on the order of 100 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the co strengths and projected rotation velocities of fuor and fuor - like spectra ( from cross - correlation and co bandhead widths ; fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) are consistent with giants rotating at breakup .",
    "however , the marginal cross - correlation significance with giants or supergiants ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) indicates that the fuors and fuor - like stars are not likely to be ordinary giants or supergiants .",
    "the combined visible and ir spectra of fuors are reasonably well fit by models of line formation in active circumstellar accretion disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the decrease in their line widths ( and implied rotational velocities ) at longer wavelengths is recognized as perhaps the best evidence of line formation in disks .",
    "the double - peaked nature of the cross - correlation of fuors and fuor - like near - ir spectra with those of late type dwarfs ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) is also consistent with a disk rotational velocity profile , and the significant near - ir excesses exhibited by most of these objects ( e.g. , @xmath54 and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) are also consistent with hot circumstellar disk material .    if the spectra of fuors and fuor - like hhens are indeed produced in accretion disks , then why are they not more similar to the spectra of embedded protostars with active disks ?",
    "even class  i protostars with large veiling and relatively high accretion rates @xmath55  yr@xmath8 do not have fuor - like spectra ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a circumstellar disk model atmosphere , high accretion rates are needed to induce a temperature gradient with a hot midplane and cooler exterior to produce a spectrum similar to a fuor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that an irradiated accretion disk model with mass accretion rate of @xmath56 yr@xmath8 reproduced the near - ir spectrum of fu  ori well , including its co and h@xmath57o absorptions .",
    "this accretion rate is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of embedded low mass protostars such as irs 63 .",
    "@xcite estimated that the mass accretion rate of the embedded protostars ylw 15a was @xmath58 yr@xmath8 , and the same modeling would produce a very similar ( within @xmath59% ) value for irs 63 since the two protostars have virtually identical effective temperatures , near - ir veilings , rotational velocities @xcite and iras fluxes .",
    "it appears that higher accretion rates are needed to produce luminous disks with absorption features similar to those found in fuors .",
    "future discoveries and observations of weaker fuors with lower accretion rates and more active protostars with higher accretion rates would be valuable in constraining further the accretion rate at which a circumstellar disk develops a strong enough temperature gradient to produce absorption lines that dominate those of the stellar photosphere .",
    "the very high degree of similarity of the fuor - like and fuor spectra ( and their good cross - correlations ) suggest that fuor activity may be more common than indicated from the small number of known classical fuors alone ; more young stars have spectra likely to originate in luminous accretion disks . taking only the list of 20 classical and fuor - like objects by @xcite and adding the two other hh sources found to have fuor - like spectra by @xcite ( hh  381  irs and hh  354  irs ; also confirmed in this work ) yields a sample of 22 objects . of these",
    ", five are widely acknowledged to be bona fide classical fuors due to their observed outbursts and spectral properties ( fu  ori , v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg , v1735 cyg , and v346 nor )",
    ". therefore fuor - like stars may outnumber fuors .",
    "however , fuors are certainly not ubiquitous .",
    "very few fuors or stars with fuor - like spectra are found in regions of clustered star formation such as tau - aur , @xmath34  oph , ngc  1333 , ic  346 , or the orion nebula cluster .",
    "instead , they are mostly found in regions of low star formation activity .",
    "this implies that either fuors are much less frequent or have many fewer outburst cycles in high density regions .",
    "one possible explanation is that interactions between stars in clusters could disrupt disks , perhaps eliminating much fuor activity during the class 0 or class i protostellar evolutionary phases . alternatively ,",
    "fuor events may be triggered by the presence of a companion star @xcite , in which case a dense cluster environment might accelerate the orbital evolution , causing fuor eruptions in clusters to occur mostly during the class 0 or class i stages @xcite .",
    "however , these are certainly not definitive explanations , and the causes of fuor events must be understood better before the inhomogeneity in the distribution of fuors and fuor - like stars can be understood .",
