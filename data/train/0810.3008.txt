    "compact groups ( cgs ) of galaxies are spatially dense groupings of generally 4 or more galaxies . in contrast to galaxies found in cluster cores ( @xcite ) , the projected velocity dispersions of cgs are generally small ( @xcite ) .",
    "this combination of low velocity dispersions and high spatial densities makes cgs an optimal environment for dynamical interactions and mergers to occur .",
    "galaxy interactions , whether in groups or pairs , have been shown to influence the observed properties of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and so cgs are an ideal environment in which to study the effects of encounters on galaxy morphology .    observational studies of cgs reveal that galaxies in these environments tend to be systematically different from the field population .",
    "perhaps most striking of all , the fraction of early - type galaxies in cgs in magnitude - limited surveys is significantly higher than in the field ; @xcite found 51@xmath1 of their cg galaxies were early - type , compared to of the field ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite found 55@xmath1 of galaxies in their cg sample were early - type .",
    "early - type galaxies can be formed via the merging of late - type systems ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) , and so these results can be explained by frequent interactions and mergers between the galaxies in the cg environment",
    ".    one result of mergers which might be expected is an enhanced star formation rate ( sfr ) , triggered by the re - distribution of gas as galaxies tidally interact .",
    "close pairs of galaxies are observed to have enhanced sfrs , consistent with this picture ( e.g. , carlberg et .",
    "1994 , @xcite and references therein ) . yet in clusters , sfrs are low when the local density is high ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , therefore it is not clear _ a priori _ which way the sfrs will go in compact group galaxies .",
    "one possible scenario is that galaxy interactions led to an exhaustion of gas in these galaxies through previous starbursts and/or stripping ( either tidal or ram pressure ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite found cg galaxies to be deficient in hi by a factor of two on average when compared to galaxies in loose groups , and @xcite found a significant deficiency in total radio emission from cg spirals compared to field spirals , again implying a reduced gaseous content .",
    "differences have also been measured in the mean colours of cg and field galaxies . in very broad terms , redder galaxies in the field generally consist of an older and/or more metal rich stellar population than bluer galaxies , although other effects such as extinction can play a significant role . @xcite",
    "found the rest - frame colours of their cg sample were on average redder than field galaxies at approximately the @xmath2 level .",
    "@xcite also found that the mean colours of galaxies in cgs were redder and had a smaller dispersion in colour than galaxies in their control sample .",
    "clearly , over the past several decades there has been considerable observational effort to determine the properties of galaxies in cgs .",
    "cosmological simulations now have sufficient detail and statistics to examine the properties of galaxies in cgs and provide a meaningful comparison with observations .",
    "for example , do these models predict that compact groups should have an excess of early - type galaxies and , if so , how large is the excess ?",
    "how does this compare to observations ?",
    "what about the colours and star formation rates of the galaxies ? can any differences between the observed and predicted properties of cg galaxies be traced back to inadequacies in the modeling or observational effects ?    in @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) , we identified compact groups in a mock galaxy catalogue ( @xcite ) based upon the millennium run simulation ( @xcite ) and investigated their spatial properties . in this paper , the second in the series , we determine the main physical properties of the galaxies in these cgs and compare them to observational results to determine if our observational and theoretical understanding of these galaxies are in conflict and , if so , why .",
    "in section  2 , we review how cgs are identified and quantified from the mock catalogue .",
    "we also review how the main physical parameters for the simulated galaxies , which we shall compare to observations , are calculated , and discuss possible limitations . in section  3 ,",
    "we determine the range of properties shown by the cgs in the mock catalogue and compare them to a control sample .",
    "we postpone the majority of the discussion of our results and comparison to observations until section  4 , and we summarise our results in section  5 .",
    "in paper  i , cgs are identified in a mock galaxy catalogue based upon their projected characteristics using the original hickson criteria ( @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to these galaxy associations identified in the simulation as hickson associations ( has ) , in recognition of the fact that we find of has in the simulation are not truly compact in three dimensions ( for example , they are projections of looser groups or physically unassociated galaxies ) and that they may contain interlopers . compact associations ( cas ) are defined as being that subset of has which are truly compact in three dimensions . in paper",
    "i , the degree of compactness of each group is quantified using the concept of three dimensional _ linking length _ , @xmath3 ( eg .",
    "we show that a good criterion for defining cas in simulations , where 3d information is available , are those has which have @xmath4 200  h@xmath0 kpc .",

    "mock galaxy catalogues were created from the output of the @xcite catalogue using the mock map facility ( momaf ) code of @xcite .",
    "we use the `` blaizot_allsky_pt_1 '' catalogue which is publicly available on the millennium website .",
    "this mock catalogue contains @xmath11 5.7 million galaxies brighter than @xmath12 .",
    "paper  i applies the hickson criteria to this mock galaxy catalogue and examines the spatial properties of the has identified .    in paper",
    "i , 15122 has were identified in the mock galaxy catalogue , consisting of a total of 64525 galaxies .",
    "however , only 28% of these has are cas ( ie .",
    "physically compact with no interlopers ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that interlopers have had a significant effect on the implied observational properties of galaxies in cgs , where it is more difficult to determine the three dimensional reality of the systems being studied .",
    "we emphasise that the term ` interloper ' does not necessarily imply that the galaxy is at a significantly different redshift to the cg ; rather , it means that the galaxy is unlikely to have evolved in the dense environment expected of a cg .",
    "we define cas as that subset of has with @xmath4 200  h@xmath0 kpc .",
    "any galaxy greater than 200  h@xmath0 kpc away from the main concentration of galaxies of a cg is therefore classed as an interloper , even though it may belong to the same larger - scale environment as the cg ( eg . a surrounding loose group ) and may not have a discordant redshift . nevertheless , its inclusion in a study of the properties of cg galaxies - which we are ultimately interested in because of their evolution in an environment where interactions should be common - could potentially bias any conclusions which are drawn .",
    "in addition , the grouping of galaxies which remains should not strictly be classed as a cg , since it probably would not satisfy the selection criteria for a cg ( particularly regarding the number of members and the surface brightness criteria ) were it not for the presence of the interloper(s ) .      in the semi - analytic models on which the mock galaxy catalogues are based , physically motivated",
    "recipes for the baryonic distribution are applied to the collisionless dark matter distribution to create realistic galaxy populations .",
    "in very broad terms , galaxy formation in these models is the process by which hot gas cools within dark matter haloes to form stars . a galaxy s merger history ,",
    "its star formation rate and various feedback processes combine to determine its evolution .",
    "galaxies are centered at the position of the most bound particle in the dark matter halo . due to the high resolution of the millennium run",
    ", the positions and velocities of these galaxies can be accurately determined by following the orbits and merging histories of the ( sub-)haloes within the simulation .",
    "below is a brief overview of the physical treatment of various processes which govern the main observable properties of the galaxies which we will examine in detail in section  3 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , and references therein , for a more complete description of the semi - analytic methods .",
    "the initial identification of the compact groups from these semi - analytic catalogues was made in paper  i using the observational criteria of @xcite .",
    "recently , these mock catalogues have been used in a similar way for a similar purpose by @xcite in their study of close galaxy pairs .",
    "@xcite assume that as each dark matter halo collapses , some baryonic matter collapses with it ( determined as a fraction of the dark matter mass ) .",
    "this gas is shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo and , following @xcite and @xcite , a cooling time is computed for the gas using cooling curves dependent on the temperature and metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "a cooling radius , defined as the radius at which the cooling time of a galaxy is equal to the age of the universe , is calculated , and all gas within the cooling radius is then treated as cold gas .",
    "the cold gas is then accreted onto the disc of the central galaxy in the halo on the free - fall timescale .",
    "there is assumed to be no cooling onto satellite galaxies .",
    "while the detailed chemistry of the cold gas can not be followed in the simulation , we assume that the cold gas fraction will trace the hi abundance .",
    "this allows comparison to observations and seems a reasonable assumption , considering the fraction of other atomic or molecular gases compared to hi in galaxies is usually small .",
    "star formation occurs in two modes . in the first",
    ", as long as the mass of cold gas is greater than a critical value , @xmath13 , star formation proceeds at a continual rate defined as    @xmath14    @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the cold gas mass and the galactic dynamical time , respectively , and @xmath17 is the efficiency by which gas is converted into stars . in the second mode , star formation occurs in starbursts triggered by mergers ( section  [ bulge_mass_fraction ] ) .",
    "photometric properties of the galaxies are determined using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite . an initial mass function is adopted and used to compute the number of stars formed in each mass interval .",
    "these stars then evolve along theoretical evolutionary tracks , primarily governed by their mass and metallicity .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the galaxy is computed by convolving the evolution of the sed of each single - age stellar population with the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "convolving the sed with the filter responses gives the luminosities and colours of each galaxy .",
    "galaxy bulges form via mergers and disc instabilities .",
    "discs are stable if    @xmath18    @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass , radius and rotational velocity of the disc , respectively .",
    "the ratio on the left hand side of equation  ( [ bulge_eq ] ) is computed for every galaxy at every time - step .",
    "if necessary , stellar mass is transferred from the disc to the bulge until the inequality is satisfied .        for mergers between galaxies , the `",
    "collisional starburst ' method of @xcite is applied .",
    "if two galaxies , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with baryonic masses @xmath24 , merge , the gas contained within both galaxies coalesce to form the disc of the post - merger galaxy , @xmath25 .",
    "the bulge of @xmath26 is composed of the bulge stars from @xmath22 and all the stars from @xmath23 .    during a merger where @xmath27 , no star formation is triggered . in the case of a major merger ( @xmath28 ) , the discs are completely destroyed and all the stellar mass is transferred to the bulge component of @xmath25 to form a disc at a later time by the accretion of cold gas . ] .",
    "additionally , a fraction of cold gas from the two merging galaxies is instantaneously consumed in a starburst .",
    "these new stars are added to the bulge component of @xmath25 .",
    "in this section , we determine how the properties of galaxies in has ( the equivalent of hcgs in the mock catalogue ) compare to the field population .",
    "further , we compare the properties of cas to those of has , to gain insight into how observational studies of cgs may have been biased by the presence of a significant number of interlopers .",
    "we note that , since cas are an interloper - free subset of has , they do not have an exact observational analogue with which to compare directly .",
    "stellar mass and redshift both correlate with many physical properties of galaxies due to dynamical and evolutionary considerations .",
    "we therefore compare the properties of the galaxies in our sample to those in a field ( control ) sample selected to match the mass and redshift distribution of has .",
    "differences between the field and has can then be connected to their different environments , not to a difference in the stellar mass or redshift .",
    "we match the control sample to has because we will first compare has to the control in order to make a comparison analogous to observational comparisons of cgs and field galaxies .",
    "later on , we compare ha to ca galaxies to understand the impact of contamination , therefore no control is required to match ca galaxies .",
    "a control sample was constructed from the initial field sample which consisted of all galaxies in the blaizot catalogue which are not members of a ha .",
    "for each ha galaxy , we found 10 unique field galaxies which have the same stellar mass and redshift as the ha galaxy to within a tolerance of 10% .",
    "the control sample contains 645250 galaxies and its stellar mass and redshift distributions are shown in figure  [ stellarmasshcg ] .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ stellarmasshcg ] shows the stellar mass distribution of all galaxies in has ( dotted brown ) , cas ( solid blue ) and our control sample ( dashed green ) , where each has been normalised to have the same total number of galaxies .",
    "the distributions for has and the control sample effectively lie on top of one another .",
    "the right panel shows the equivalent distributions for the redshift distribution of the galaxies in the groups .",
    "one dimensional kolmogrov - smirnov ( ks ) tests between the ha galaxies and the control sample galaxies show that for both mass and redshift , the null hypothesis that both distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution is acceptable at the @xmath29 level .",
    "galaxies in cas have a slightly higher mean stellar mass than galaxies in has ( @xmath30 compared to @xmath31 ) and a slightly lower mean redshift ( @xmath32 compared to @xmath33 ) .",
    "colour distributions for galaxies in has , cas and our control sample , with the same line styles and scaling as used in figure  [ stellarmasshcg ] .",
    "the distribution of the control sample is bi - modal , representing galaxies in the red sequence and blue cloud .",
    "has are also bi - modal , but there is a far greater proportion of redder galaxies in comparison to the control sample .",
    "in contrast , cas are nearly all red , @xmath34 , with only a very low level tail to bluer colours.,width=317 ]    in observational studies , galaxies in cgs are found on average to be redder than the field population ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy colour is a broad indication of the age and metallicity of the luminosity - weighted mean stellar populations of a galaxy , with older populations and more metal - rich populations generally appearing redder .",
    "to some extent , colour also correlates with galactic morphology , with late - type , spiral galaxies generally appearing bluer than early - type , elliptical galaxies .    for colour analysis in this paper",
    ", we use the rest frame sloan filters ( _ ugriz _ ) available in the mock catalogue which take into account the effects of dust in each galaxy .",
    "figure  [ u_r_hcg ] shows the @xmath35 colour distribution of galaxies in the has , cas and the control sample , represented by the equivalent line styles and scaling to figure  [ stellarmasshcg ] .",
    "the control sample distribution is bi - modal , with the largest and reddest peak centered near @xmath36 and a broader , secondary , bluer feature centered around @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath35 colour distribution of galaxies in has is qualitatively similar to the control sample , showing a similar bi - modal structure .",
    "however , the red peak is much more dominant for the has than for the control , and the bluer feature is considerably weaker . in all , 79% of galaxies in has are redder than @xmath38 , compared to 63% for the control .",
    "the distribution of ca galaxies in figure  [ u_r_hcg ] stands out in comparison to the control and ha galaxies ; in contrast to these two populations , virtually no galaxies in cas are bluer than @xmath39 and the distribution is clearly uni - modal . given that the contamination by the control sample consists of both blue and red galaxies , has appear to have a population of blue galaxies which are mistaken for true cg galaxies . however , in the environment of cas ( ie .",
    "all galaxies are in very close proximity ) , there appears to be a dearth of blue and a dominance of red galaxies .",
    "recent work by @xcite has also found that semi - analytical models predict the fraction of red galaxies as a function of environment and mass that is qualitatively similar to observations .",
    "@xcite was the first to show that the proportion of elliptical and lenticular galaxies increases at the expense of spiral galaxies in regions with higher projected galaxy density .",
    "numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) support this result by demonstrating that a merger between two spiral galaxies almost always ends in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "therefore , environments rich in interactions and merger events ( that is , high galaxy density and low velocity dispersions ) are expected to be fertile regions for the formation of elliptical galaxies .    the above expectations appear to have been observationally confirmed for cgs .",
    "studies have shown that cgs contain a significantly different morphological population of galaxies than does the field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that compact groups contain a higher fraction of early - type galaxies as compared to a field population and more recently , @xcite show that compact groups isolated from large - scale structures have a higher fraction of s0 galaxies as compared to the field .",
    "we quantify the fraction of early- and late - type galaxies in our mock survey by using the ratio of bulge - to - total stellar mass ( @xmath40 ) for each galaxy .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a galaxy to be bulge - dominated ( early type ) if its bulge - to - total ratio is @xmath41 and disc - dominated ( late - type ) if @xmath42 .",
    "however , these cuts are indicative only , and we stress that the @xmath40 ratio is not sufficient by itself to determine morphology from an observational perspective , although it is the most analogous quantity in the simulations and is still useful from a statistical perspective .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ b_t_hcg ] shows the distribution of @xmath40 for all the galaxies in the has , cas and the control sample , where the line - styles and normalization are the same as in figure  [ stellarmasshcg ] .",
    "the shaded parts of figure [ b_t_hcg ] show the approximate regimes of late- and early- type galaxies . in the left panel ,",
    "there is a spike of galaxies in all three samples with @xmath43 , ie .",
    "pure bulge galaxies .",
    "this is a result of the recipe for bulge formation described in section  [ bulge_mass_fraction ] , since a merger between two galaxies of approximately equal size leads to most stars being deposited in a bulge .",
    "however , in this study we are concerned only with the total fraction of early and late - type galaxies .",
    "regardless of whether these galaxies are really pure bulges or not , it seems clear that they will be earlier type .",
    "in addition , all three samples show the same feature , and so our relative results on how galaxy morphology varies between the control , cas and has will not be affected .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ b_t_hcg ] shows that galaxies in the ha sample possess a much higher fraction of bulge - dominated galaxies than the control sample , qualitatively consistent with the observational results . using our definition for early - type galaxies , we find 55% of galaxies in has are bulge dominated ,",
    "compared to only 35% for the control sample .",
    "a cursory glance at the left panel of figure  [ b_t_hcg ] shows that the effect of interloping galaxies is significant when examining the relative proportions of early and late - type galaxies in cgs .",
    "in particular , the @xmath40 distribution of has compared to cas is significantly different . whereas the distribution for has has roughly equal numbers of late- and early - type galaxies , the distribution of cas peaks at @xmath44 and has a tail to smaller values .",
    "clearly , the preference for field galaxies to be late - type means that interlopers artificially increase the proportion of late - type galaxies which appear to be in cgs . in total , 74@xmath1 of ca galaxies",
    "nearly three - quarters of all galaxies in cas ) are bulge - dominated .    as well as examining individual galaxies , we can also determine the average morphology of the galaxies in each ha and ca to see if they are dominated by early or late - type galaxies .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ b_t_hcg ] shows the average @xmath40 values for each ha and ca .",
    "only 4% of cas are late - type dominated groups ( with an average @xmath45 ) whereas 84% are dominated by early type galaxies ( with an average @xmath46 ) .",
    "this compares to @xmath47% of late - type dominated has and @xmath48% of early - type dominated has .",
    "therefore we find a much higher fraction of early - type galaxies in cas compared with has , which tentatively suggests that the fraction of early - type galaxies in observed cgs is likely to be under - estimated by @xmath1140% due to interlopers .",
    "@xcite obtained observations of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) in hcgs and estimated the mass of cool gas within each group .",
    "they found hcg galaxies to be deficient in hi by a factor of two on average when compared to galaxies with a similar morphology in loose groups .",
    "@xcite found that , in regions of higher galaxy density , galaxies generally contain less hi compared to the field population .",
    "this result was echoed by @xcite , and later @xcite , who found that the neutral hydrogen content of galaxies of the same morphology depended strongly on their environment .",
    "the low gaseous content of galaxies in high density environments can be attributed to the removal of gas through processes such as tidal and ram pressure stripping and/or enhanced star formation activity during interactions , processes which may play an important role in cg evolution .    .",

    "in contrast to both control and ha galaxies , ca galaxies are nearly exclusively gas - deficient , with @xmath514% with a cold gas fraction greater than 10% .",

    "this velocity dispersion has been calculated from the redshifts of each galaxy as listed in the mock catalogue , which includes both the hubble velocity and the peculiar velocity components .    as the top panel of figure  [ vel_disp ] makes clear ,",
    "the has have a ( very ) significant tail to very high values of @xmath56 due to interloping galaxies at vastly different redshifts .",
    "observationally , any candidate member of a cg which was measured to possess a very different redshift to the other members would be excluded from the calculation of the velocity dispersion since that is a clear indication that it is an interloper .",
    "for example , it is common practice to exclude any group which has an apparent velocity dispersion of @xmath58kms@xmath0 ( @xcite ) ; in the simulation , there are virtually no cas with @xmath59kms@xmath0 , demonstrating the validity of this procedure .",
    "the distribution of @xmath56 below @xmath60kms@xmath0 are very similar for both cas and has , with a peak at @xmath61kms@xmath0 and a mean value of @xmath62kms@xmath0 for both samples . however , whereas there are @xmath63 cas in total , there are @xmath64 has with @xmath65kms@xmath0 .",
    "this implies that approximately one - third of all cgs with @xmath66kms@xmath0 consist , at least in part , of interloping galaxies .",
    "these could act to contaminate any further study of cg galaxy properties .",

    "[ colourmagdiagram ] , the control population shows this distribution , with a relatively tight ` red sequence ' ( centered around @xmath70 ) and a more diffuse ` blue cloud ' ( with @xmath71 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is populated predominantly by star - forming galaxies whereas the former consists of galaxies with low star formation rates and older stellar populations in general ( @xcite ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ colourmagdiagram ] shows that the galaxies in has ( that is , those simulated galaxies identified on application of the hickson criteria ) exhibit both a red sequence population and a blue cloud population .",
    "in contrast , galaxies in cas ( that is , those has which are physically dense and contain no interlopers ) are confined nearly exclusively to the red sequence , with few galaxies occupying the blue cloud ( 97 @xmath1 of ca galaxies are redder than @xmath72 ) .",
    "the effect of interlopers in compact groups therefore appears to introduce a population of blue , star forming galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by our previous examination of colour ( section  3.3 ) , cold gas fraction and star formation rate ( section  3.4 ) in these galaxies .",
    "we find galaxies in has are preferentially redder , have lower gas fractions and have lower specific star formation rates than the control sample , but in all cases bluer , higher gas fraction , higher specific star formation rate galaxies are present in significant numbers .",
    "galaxies in cas , however , are strikingly different in all three observables .",
    "for example , 21% of galaxies in has are bluer than @xmath72 , 23% of galaxies in has have cold gas fraction in excess of 10% , and 22% of galaxies in has have specific star formation rates higher than @xmath53yr@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , virtually no galaxies in cas satisfy any of these three criteria .",
    "in addition , @xmath73 of galaxies in has appear to be bulge dominated , whereas the fraction of bulge - dominated galaxies in cas is significantly higher than this , at @xmath74 .",
    "figure  [ notcas ] shows the distribution of the properties we have been discussing for all galaxies in has which are _ not _ cas compared to the control sample .",
    "the galaxies in these @xmath75200  h@xmath0kpc has are clearly not randomly drawn from the field , since their distributions differ from the control sample in all panels of figure  [ notcas ] .",
    "as we show in paper i , these has consist of some loose groups and sets of completely unassociated galaxies , as well as many galaxy pairs , triplets , and even some quadruplets , with unassociated background and/or foreground galaxies projected along the same line - of - sight .",
    "it is this population of interloping galaxies from the field which appears to bias our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in cgs .",
    "we note that no cuts by velocity dispersion were applied when we identified has . in practice ,",
    "a velocity dispersion cut can only be applied when a relatively small number of compact groups are being studied , since getting redshift information for every galaxy in every group of a much larger sample is impractical .",
    "for example , in the sdss , galaxies are quasi - randomly targeted for spectroscopy and the probability that all galaxies in a compact group are selected for spectroscopy is very small , especially since fiber collisions will occur if trying to target all the members of a dense system . in the few situations where full redshift information is available , groups with very large velocity dispersions ( @xmath76kms@xmath0 )",
    "are usually discarded ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) since it is likely they contain interlopers .",
    "our analysis in section  3.5 suggests that such an approach can greatly reduce contamination ; however , over one - third of the systems identified are predicted to still contain interlopers and are therefore not genuine compact groups .",
    "this population will still potentially act to bias any study of cg properties .        as discussed in section  4.1.1 ,",
    "@xmath77% of galaxies in cas are redder than @xmath72 .",
    "our analysis of the mock catalogue therefore suggests that the purity of a cg sample can be significantly increased by only selecting those groups whose members are redder than @xmath78 , since this will preferentially remove has which have @xmath79 200  h@xmath0 kpc . of course",
    ", selecting cgs by colour may lead to a potential bias , since we select against any genuine cgs which happen to have bluer galaxies .",
    "however , for studies of cgs where the property of interest is not thought to depend strongly on colour , then this selection technique potentially offers the opportunity to greatly reduce contamination .",
    "projects such as the red cluster survey ( @xcite ) adopt a similar methodology for the identification of galaxy clusters .",
    "+        there is an extensive body of literature on the observational properties of galaxies in cgs and , in general , we find good correspondence between the properties of galaxies identified in has in the mock catalogue and those in reality .",
    "observationally , cgs contain a greater proportion of early - type galaxies than the field ; @xcite and @xcite found that roughly half of all galaxies in cgs were early type , compared to @xmath80 for the field ( @xcite ) . we find that @xmath73 of all galaxies in has in the mock catalogue ( ie .",
    "those galaxies identified as belonging to compact groups through application of the hickson criteria ) have @xmath81 , and are probably best described as early - type . as discussed in the previous section , however , the true fraction of early type galaxies in compact groups is predicted to be nearer three - quarters , since interlopers from the field ( which are more likely to be late - type ) can increase the apparent proportion of late - type galaxies in cgs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both find that galaxies in compact groups are redder than the field population on average .",
    "our results suggest the same ; 79% of galaxies in has are redder than @xmath82 , compared to only 63% for the field .",
    "@xcite measure median colours for their compact group galaxies of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "our values for the galaxies in has compare very favourably to this , with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "for the field samples , @xcite calculate @xmath87 and @xmath88 , whereas we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "colour distribution for compact group galaxies identified by @xcite corrected for foreground extinction .",
    "compact groups in the @xcite catalogue were identified using a galaxy catalogue with a magnitude limit of @xmath91 , three magnitudes deeper than our mock galaxy catalogue .",
    "the blue histogram shows all 744 galaxies in the observed cgs , whereas the orange histogram shows only those galaxies brighter than @xmath92 , the magnitude limit of our mock catalogue ( although note that this subset of observed galaxies is different to those galaxies which would be identified had the original catalogue been magnitude limited at @xmath92).,width=317 ]    figure  [ colourlee ] shows the observed ( de - reddened ) @xmath93 colour distribution for the @xcite compact groups .",
    "the @xcite catalogue identifies compact groups using a galaxy catalogue with a magnitude limit of @xmath91 , three magnitudes deeper than our mock galaxy catalogue .",
    "the blue histogram therefore shows all 744 galaxies in the observed cgs , whereas the orange histogram shows only those galaxies brighter than @xmath92 , the magnitude limit of our mock catalogue ( although note that this subset of observed galaxies is different to those galaxies which would be identified had the original catalogue had a magnitude limit of @xmath94 ) .",
    "there are several qualitative and quantitative similarities between the observed colour distributions in figure  8 and the predicted ones in figure  2 .",
    "in particular , there is a red peak with a blue tail in the data , with the peak at @xmath95 , similar to figure  2 .",
    "68% of cg galaxies with @xmath96 are redder than @xmath38 ( 75% of cg galaxies with @xmath97 ) .",
    "this compares favourably to the 79% in the same colour range from the simulation , although it may suggest that the simulated galaxies are slightly too red compared to observations .",
    "however , the reddest galaxies are seen in the observations ; whereas there are very few simulated cg galaxies with @xmath98 , 30% of the galaxies in figure  8 are redder than this limit .",
    "@xcite found that galaxies in compact groups appear deficient in hi by a factor of approximately two in comparison to the field .",
    "while it is not possible to calculate the fraction of hi in the galaxies in the simulation , it is possible to determine the fraction of ` cold gas ' in galaxies in has and cas relative to the field .",
    "we have made the assumption that the cold gas fraction traces the hi gas fraction and the fraction of other atomic or molecular gases should be negligible .",
    "once again , we find that galaxies in has have , in general , a considerably lower cold gas fraction than the control sample ( 77% of galaxies in has have a cold gas fraction less than 10% , compared to 55% for the control ) .",
    "the mean cold gas fraction of the control sample galaxies is @xmath99% , whereas the mean cold gas fraction for galaxies in has is approximately a factor of two smaller , at @xmath100 .",
    "this is in good relative agreement with observations , although we note that our control sample is not made up of galaxies exclusively in loose groups , as was the case for the observational study .",
    "the main disagreement between our study and observational work is the comparison of ssfrs .",
    "observational studies suggest that the star formation rates of galaxies in cgs are broadly similar to the general field population ( @xcite ) .",
    "inspection of the lower panel of figure  [ cold_sfr_hcg ] shows that the ssfrs of field galaxies and has are quantitatively different , but they do share some similarities .",
    "in particular , they both have peaks at @xmath101yr@xmath0 and tails to much lower values .",
    "it is possible that the observations do not yet have sufficient statistics to show the differences in the distributions , although it is equally possible that the differences do not exist .",
    "it is once again important to emphasise , however , that any similarities between the star formation rates of has and the control sample disappear when one considers only those groups which are physically dense and which contain no interlopers .",
    "these trends are also seen for galaxies in cluster environments : @xcite found spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster were deficient in hi relative to their counterparts in the field .",
    "lower star formation rates for galaxies in clusters compared with those in the field at the same redshift have also been found up to z @xmath11 1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that compact clusters at low redshift had cores which were essentially devoid of blue galaxies and a clear correlation between galaxy morphology with local density ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and cluster - centric radius ( @xcite ) has been observed .",
    "it is reassuring to find that the observational properties of cgs are broadly reflected in the properties of the galaxies identified in the mock catalogue ; these galaxies are generally more likely to be bulge - dominated systems than the field , are redder , have lower cold gas fractions , and exhibit relatively similar star formation rates to the field population .",
    "in colour - magnitude space , galaxies identified as belonging to compact groups ( has ) occupy a dominant red sequence but there are considerable numbers which occupy the blue cloud . on the removal of interlopers , nearly all galaxies in compact groups",
    "occupy the red sequence ( figure  [ colourmagdiagram ] ) .",
    "our results agree well with the observations of cgs , but in addition strongly suggest that some of these results have been influenced by interloping galaxies which did not co - evolve with the other galaxies in the cg .",
    "when this is taken into account , the simulations suggest that the fraction of galaxies in cgs which are _ bulge - dominated , red , have low cold gas fractions and low star formation rated have been previously underestimated_. the low star formation rates that we imply are consistent with evolution in an environment where interactions were common , where either most of the gas was initially removed from these galaxies via stripping processes and/or the gas was used up in brief , intense periods of star formation shortly after the galaxy entered the cg environment .",
    "what is very noticeable from our results , and is nicely summarised in the right panel of figure  [ colourmagdiagram ] , is the homogeneity of the galaxies in cas ; virtually all belong to the red sequence and are `` red and dead '' .",
    "we first discuss if the origin of this result is due to a simplified treatment of gas removal in the semi - analytical modeling of satellites in these simulations ( section 4.3.1 ) . on concluding that this is not the likely interpretation",
    ", we turn our attention to possible evolutionary scenarios for compact groups ( section 4.3.2 ) .",
    "there are certain evolutionary processes which are believed to operate predominantly on satellite galaxies , and which do not affect central galaxies ( that is , those at the centres of their own dark matter halo ) to the same degree .",
    "in particular , when a smaller dark matter halo is accreted by , and becomes a satellite of , a larger dark matter halo , its hot , diffuse gas may be stripped .",
    "this gas can no longer feed the satellite galaxy , and so once the cold gas in the galaxy s disc is used up , its star - formation ends ( termed `` strangulation '' ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in circumstances where the external pressure is sufficiently high ,",
    "ram pressure stripping may remove the cold gas directly , abruptly ending star formation ( @xcite ) .    in most semi - analytic models ,",
    "the loss of a satellite s hot gas is modeled as an instantaneous process .",
    "however , it has been suggested that this not a good approximation in all cases ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and it has been shown that satellites simulated in this way are frequently too `` red and dead '' in comparison to observational results ( @xcite ) . in paper",
    "i , we showed that just over half of cas in our mock catalogue share a common dark matter halo , where one galaxy is considered to be the `` central '' galaxy and the remaining ones are considered `` satellites '' ( although cas consisting of 4 separate haloes , and thus four `` central '' galaxies , do exist ) .",
    "given the significant number of `` satellite '' galaxies in our sample , it is important to determine if uncertainties in the treatment of strangulation for these objects has lead us to conclude , incorrectly , that cas are predominantly red and dead .",
    "figure  [ haloproperty ] shows the colour ( top left ) , cold gas fraction ( top right ) , @xmath40 ( lower left ) and ssfr ( lower right ) for all the galaxies which we identify as being a member of a ca in our mock catalogue , split according to whether they are a `` satellite '' ( orange solid lines ) or a `` central '' galaxy ( blue dashed ) .",
    "central galaxies of cas are marginally bluer than satellites and have a slightly higher cold gas fraction .",
    "the central galaxy ssfr is significantly higher than for the satellites , reflecting the fact that strangulation has quenched star formation in satellites .",
    "the morphology of central galaxies in cas , as represented by @xmath40 ( see section 3.3 ) , is a mix of early- and late - type but with a dominant peak around @xmath102 , which indicates that a major merger has occurred ( recall section 2.2.4 ) .",
    "there is a similar peak for satellite galaxies , which show a preference towards having a higher bulge fraction than central galaxies .    from figure  [ haloproperty ]",
    ", we conclude that `` central '' galaxies in cas show some differences to `` satellite '' galaxies in cas , particularly regarding the ssfr .",
    "however , it is still the case that , for both central and satellite galaxies in cas , they are much redder , have a considerably smaller cold gas fraction , are generally earlier type ( as traced by bulge fraction ) and have significantly lower ssfr than the field galaxies in our sample ( recall figures 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . thus our overall conclusion about cas being `` red and dead '' galaxies , significantly redder than the field population , stands even if we only consider `` central '' galaxies .",
    "a simplified treatment of satellite strangulation can not account for this result .    in the semi - analytic models , central galaxies are typically red if they are massive ( where agn feedback can offset a slowly cooling halo ) whereas satellite galaxies tend to be red , independent of their stellar mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "to ensure that the high red fraction of cas is not driven by a large ( red ) satellite population and massive ( red ) central galaxies , we examined the colour distribution of central ca galaxies as a function of stellar mass . at the low mass end",
    ", central galaxies in cas still dominate the red sequence whereas galaxies in the control sample are still mostly in the blue cloud .",
    "finally , we note that central galaxies in the has , cas and the control sample ( matched in mass and redshift to the has ) are all subject to the same uncertainties in the semi - analytic modeling ( e.g. , quenching , agn feedback ) .",
    "thus , the _ relative _ distribution of galaxy properties in each of these three subsets provide a more robust comparison than is possible using absolute values .",
    "our current comparison between compact groups identified in a mock catalogue to previous observations of compact groups suggests that the former reproduce the latter well , given the current theoretical and observational limitations .",
    "however , the fact that the simulated cas do not resemble typical field galaxies , and in fact show only a small spread in properties , leads us to consider possible evolutionary explanations which could produce this homogeneous population :    1 .",
    "most compact groups did not form out of the typical field galaxy population , and instead formed out of a population of `` red and dead '' , early - type galaxies ; 2 .",
    "most compact groups formed long ago , perhaps out of the typical field galaxy population , and the member galaxies evolved over cosmological timescales to become a population of `` red and dead '' ellipticals ; 3 .",
    "compact groups form continuously , perhaps out of the typical field galaxy population , and the evolutionary times of galaxies in compact groups are very short so they quickly become a population of `` red and dead '' ellipticals .",
    "the origin for the different properties of ca galaxies compared to the field in these models must be rooted in their mass assembly and gas accretion histories . in a future contribution , we will explore the dynamical evolution of the simulated compact groups in the semi - analytic simulations by tracing the progenitors of the galaxies and haloes identified as belonging to a ca in our @xmath103 mock catalogue using the outputs of the simulation from previous time steps .",
    "this enables us to reconstruct the formation history of the groups and compare their lifetimes to the evolutionary timescales of galaxies , particularly those relating to movement onto the red sequence of the colour magnitude diagram .",
    "in this paper we have compared the observed morphological properties of galaxies in compact groups with those identified in a mock galaxy catalogue , to determine if and where our observational understanding of the evolution of these systems is in conflict with modern theoretical simulations of galaxy evolution .",
    "we find that the properties of galaxies identified as belonging to compact groups in the simulation are in qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "bluer galaxies , late - type galaxies , gas - rich galaxies and galaxies with higher specific star formation rates are all present in compact groups .",
    "however , on average , compact groups exhibit a higher proportion of early - type galaxies than the field , and are generally redder and gas - deficient compared to the field .",
    "the specific star formation rates of compact group galaxies are , on the other hand , relatively similar to the field .",
    "importantly , we find that the effect of interlopers on these results is significant . by using the full three dimensional positions of the galaxies in the mock catalogue",
    ", we can remove those groups which are not physically dense and/or which contain interlopers .",
    "the compact groups which remain are found to consist nearly exclusively of red @xmath104 , gas - deficient ( @xmath105 ) galaxies with low specific star formation rates ( ssfr @xmath106 ) .",
    "we predict that approximately @xmath107 of compact groups are dominated by early - type galaxies when interlopers are accounted for , compared to @xmath108 when they are not .",
    "thus modern cosmological simulations suggest that galaxies in compact groups have homogeneous properties and are predominately `` red and dead '' . in contrast",
    ", observations suggest that compact groups exhibit a larger range in galaxy properties .",
    "our results imply that the majority ( but not all ) of galaxies identified as being members of compact groups which are late - type , blue , relatively gas rich and/or have relatively - high star formation rates are interlopers .",
    "selection by colour is predicted to greatly reduce contamination levels of cgs , although this will introduce a potential bias into the population .",
    "where redshift information is available for all prospective group members , observational contamination can be reduced ; however , one - third of all compact groups with low velocity dispersions ( @xmath65kms@xmath0 ) appear to contain interlopers .",
