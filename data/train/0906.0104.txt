    "investigation on the properties of prime numbers is an interesting area of study for centuries .",
    "starting from euclid s result  @xcite on the infinititude of primes to modern primality testing algorithms  @xcite , research on prime numbers has grown exponentially .",
    "there exist many results on the set of prime numbers .",
    "some of them has been proved , such as bertrand s postulate  @xcite .",
    "some of them has remained conjectures till today , and amongst them , some important ones are : goldbach s conjecture  @xcite , legendre s conjecture  @xcite , brocard s conjecture  @xcite etc .",
    "we concentrate on sharpening legendre s conjecture and bertrand s postulate in this paper .",
    "both of these are related to the number of prime numbers in certain intervals .    in this paper , we propose four novel conjectures on prime numbers .    1 .",
    "our analysis of legendre s conjecture brings forth two results . 1 .   in conjecture  [ improvelegend ]",

    "2 .   in proposition",
    "[ brocard ] , we prove brocard s conjecture using our conjecture  [ improvelegend ] .",
    "2 .   our conjecture  [ legendbound ]",
    "improves the upper bound on the number of primes in @xmath0 $ ] as given by rosser and schoenfeld s theorem .",
    "3 .   our third conjecture and its consequences are two - fold . 1 .   in conjecture  [ improvebertrand ] ,",
    "we generalize bertrand s postulate on the number of primes in @xmath1 $ ] ( bertrand s postulate deals with @xmath2 only ) .",
    "2 .   as an implication of the above generalization , in corollary  [ ub_nth_prime ]",
    ", we propose a stronger upper bound on @xmath3-th prime than what follows from bertrand s postulate .",
    "4 .   our fourth and final conjecture proposes an upper bound on the number of primes in @xmath1 $ ] . to our knowledge , this problem has not been attempted before this work .",
    "legendre s conjecture  @xcite is an important unsolved problem in the domain of prime numbers .",
    "it states that :    [ legend ] [ legendre s conjecture ] + for every positive integer @xmath3 , there exists at least one prime @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "although no formal proof has ever been found for this theorem , empirical works suggest that the number of primes in such intervals is not one but more .",
    "let the number of primes between @xmath6 and @xmath7 be called @xmath8 .",
    "the following table contains brief results .",
    ".no . of primes between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have experimented with the intermediate values of @xmath3 and @xmath11 as well , and found the conjecture to hold .",
    "but due to lack of space we do not show the results here .",
    "however , we find that this bound is quite tight only for small values @xmath11 . as @xmath11 increases ,",
    "the upper bound becomes increasingly loose .",
    "however , no violation has been detected till @xmath12 , and with the upper bound increasing monotonically , it is unlikely that any violation will ever occur .",
    "also , between @xmath3 and @xmath13 there are @xmath14 numbers . for small values of @xmath3 and @xmath11",
    ", the upper bound of @xmath15 may be greater than this value , in which our conjecture obviously does not provide any new information .",
    "we find that , the suggested upper bound is less than @xmath14 only for @xmath16 .",
    "analyzing this graphically , we find that this approximately requires @xmath17 .",
    "this paper attempts at sharpening legendre s conjecture and generalizing bertrand s postulate on prime numbers .",
    "we present both formal arguments and empirical supports to defend our new conjectures and their corollaries .",
