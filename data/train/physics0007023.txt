    "evaluations of the radiative corrections in higher order for bound states are an involved task because of the appearance of a multitude of terms , and because of the difficulties associated with bound state formalism . in this paper , we present an improved calculation of higher order corrections to the one  loop self energy of an electron in an excited 3p or 4p state .    for the contribution @xmath2 of the one  loop radiative correction to the lamb shift of a bound electron , we have the following non - analytic expansion in powers of @xmath1 times the fine structure constant @xmath0 @xmath3 where @xmath4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the remainder function @xmath5 is of order @xmath6 and is comprised of the terms @xmath7 and higher coefficients .",

    "pachucki s method relies on the fact that the low  energy part and the high  energy part may formally be regarded as functions of the fine structure constant @xmath0 and the cutoff parameter @xmath21 .",

    "energy parts are expanded first in @xmath0 , and then in epsilon ( the order of expansion plays a crucial role in that case ) .",
    "another important point in pachucki s method is that the spurious lower order terms which were present in mohr s calculation vanish in the limit @xmath62 , so we do not need to take them into account .",
    "for example , in mohr s calculation , the first spurious term @xmath63 originated from a trivial integration @xmath64 . in pachucki",

    "that means by choosing the @xmath21 prescription , we not only make the expression for the low  energy part separately finite , but also dispose of the spurious lower order terms .",
    "that is the principal reason why pachucki s method is well suited for the analytic calculation of higher order corrections to the one  loop self energy .",
    "the choice of epsilon remains arbitrary to a certain extent ( it has to be because we analytically expand in @xmath21 and thus require arbitrariness ) .",

    ", we expand the propagator of the bound electron in powers of the binding field @xmath66 .",
    "we initially assume a fixed value for @xmath21 which prevents infrared problems , but since eventually @xmath67 , this expansion is regarded as a formal expansion that is not necessarily convergent .",
    "however , @xmath21 may not be arbitrarily large .",
    "if we let @xmath68 , we enclose poles not only from the photon propagator , but also from the negative spectrum of the dirac - coulomb propagator , which would significantly alter our expression for the low  energy part . it is also required that in the entire domain of the low  energy part , an expansion of the expression @xmath69 in the matrix element @xmath70 in powers of @xmath71 corresponds to an expansion in powers of @xmath72 ( this requirement justifies the so - called dipole approximation , in which we replace @xmath73 by unity to obtain the lowest order contribution to the self energy ) .",
