    "pulmonary fibrosis ( pf ) is a debilitating disease without cure that affects approximately 5 million people worldwide  @xcite and leads to the death of 40,000 people every year in the us alone  @xcite .",
    "anti - inflammatory , antifibrotic , and immunosuppressive therapies have all been used in the treatment of pf , but unfortunately none have been shown to improve survival or quality of life  @xcite .",
    "the only truly effective treatment for pf remains lung transplantation , but donor lungs are scarce , so being able to accurately predict the stage of the disease is critical for deciding how best to choose recipients for donor lungs among the many patients who could potentially benefit .",
    "a key clinical indicator of pf severity is the increase it causes in the elastic stiffness of the lung , which is readily measured in patients  @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown that the progression of macroscopic lung stiffness may not always precisely track the microscopic progression of the underlying fibrotic disease  @xcite , so understanding exactly how these two processes are linked is clearly of major importance for pf prognosis .",
    "also , the progression of pf at the microscopic level influences the rate at which the local microenvironment of the tissue changes , which in turn could influence the rate of fibrotic remodeling by lung fibroblast cells . understanding the nature of this progression may thus be crucial for the development of novel therapies .",
    "some cases of pf have a genetic basis , some result from known injuries to the lung tissue , and many are idiopathic  @xcite . regardless of the cause , however , the evolution of pf is invariably accompanied by a progressive stiffening of the lung tissue that manifests clinically as a reduction in lung volume and an increase in the work of breathing .",
    "microscopically , pf is inherently a remodeling process in which , at least initially , isolated local regions of the lung become fibrotic as collagen is deposited by the fibroblast cells .",
    "this increases regional tissue stiffness , but the effect on overall lung stiffness is more subtle .",
    "in particular , we have shown previously  @xcite that the total amount of collagen deposited in the lung during pf may be a poor indicator of abnormalities in global lung stiffness as fibrosis develops .",
    "more important is whether or not the stiffened tissue remains in isolated islands or becomes linked in continuous paths that span the entire tissue space .",
    "when such paths arise , at the percolation threshold  @xcite , the subsequent rate of increase in lung stiffness becomes dramatically enhanced as pf progresses , which represents the rapid approach of end - stage disease .",
    "the point at which the percolation threshold is reached for a given collagen load is strongly influenced by the spatial pattern of the collagen deposition .",
    "the characteristic scarring patterns seen in pf indicate that this deposition does not manifest as a large number of lesions of all different sizes , but rather as a relatively small number of larger fibrotic patches ( figure  [ f.images ] ) .",
    "this would seem to indicate that fibrosis development in the lung is not random , but rather occurs with a significant degree of spatial correlation .",
    "one possible explanation for this spatial correlation is the existence of fixed sites of fibrogenesis that spawn radial growth of collagen deposition .",
    "another possibility is that once collagen is deposited at a particular location , the local increase in stiffness that it engenders gives rise to a pro - fibrotic mechanical environment for the surrounding cells which themselves start to produce collagen in a positive feedback loop .",
    "understanding the link between total collagen load and lung stiffness may thus provide a clue as to which of these two possibilities is more likely to pertain in pf .    in the present study",
    ", we build on our prior work on the percolation of random fibrotic lesions across the lung  @xcite to introduce a new elastic network model of the fibrotic lung that enables us to investigate how the evolution of lung tissue stiffness depends on the spatial correlation of fibrotic lesions as they develop over time .",
    "we use random placement of stiffened springs in the network to mimic the uncorrelated appearance of new fibrotic regions , and the stiffening of springs along a random walk  @xcite from some starting point to mimic the correlated local growth of fibrosis . invoking both _ percolation _ and _ random walk _ simultaneously represents the intrinsic combination of both random and correlated depositions of collagen .",
    "the relative contributions of these two processes are controlled by specifying the length of the random walk .",
    "we show here that the length of the random walk significantly affects the spatial organization of fibrotic regions in the model , which in turn influences the evolution of overall model stiffness .",
    "the images are reproduced with permission from ref .",
    "( permission is under request),width=491 ]",
    "our model is a two - dimensional network of hexagonally arranged linear elastic springs , each spring representing an alveolar wall as seen in a thin slice of lung tissue .",
    "the outer borders of the network are held fixed such that each spring is pre - stressed to correspond to a given lung volume .",
    "the model is initialized to be homogeneous with all springs having identical unit stiffness .",
    "local collagen deposition is modeled by stiffening individual springs by sequentially applying the following two growth rules :    1 .",
    "_ rule 1  percolation _ : a spring is chosen at random and stiffened by a factor of 100 representing the initial deposition of collagen ; 2 .",
    "_ rule 2  random walk _ : a spring is chosen at random from the neighbors of the spring stiffened in rule 1 .",
    "this spring is stiffened by a factor of 100 , followed by the stiffening of a random neighbor , and so on .",
    "after @xmath16 springs have been visited along this random walk , the new equilibrium configuration of the network is determined .",
    "this random walk represents the local spreading of fibrosis .    this sequence of applying _",
    "rules 1 _ and _ 2 _ followed by finding the minimum energy configuration of the network is continued until all springs in the network have been stiffened .",
    "_ rule 1 _ is the same uncorrelated regular percolation that we introduced previously  @xcite .",
    "_ rule 2 _ incorporates random springs from _ rule 1 _ to seed the initial sites of spring stiffening , and for @xmath15 , the length of the random walk is zero . for @xmath17",
    ", however , most of the spring stiffening in _ rule 2 _ occurs along random walk trajectories starting from the initial seed locations .",
    "this gives rise to local clusters of stiffened springs that tend to have an irregular shape .",
    "also , since a random walk is a markovian process , a spring may be visited more than once in a given random walk , resulting in cluster sizes less than or equal to @xmath0 springs .",
    "note that a spring s stiffness is only allowed to increase once , regardless of how many times it has been visited .",
    "the biological rationales motivating these rules are as follows .",
    "first , we chose to stiffen each spring by a factor of 100 because this eventually increases the local stiffness similar to what has been reported for fibrotic human lung tissue  @xcite .",
    "_ rule 1 _ assumes that fibrosis occurs purely by chance , and that its presence does not contribute to the fibrotic mechanism .",
    "rule 2 _ , on the other hand , assumes that the local presence of fibrosis has a significant influence on the occurrence of further fibrosis in the affected region .",
    "a possible mechanism for this influence is chemical ; any mediators involved in fibrogenesis are likely to diffuse throughout the neighboring region and thus grow a fibrotic lesion outward from its starting point .",
    "however , the spread of fibrosis can also be due to mechanical mechanisms .",
    "for example , a stiff fibrotic patch is likely to increase the stress and strain experienced by neighboring normal tissue as lung volume cycles during breathing .",
    "if a fibroblast cell sitting in this neighboring tissue responds to this change in environment by depositing extra collagen as a defense mechanism against the extra strain , then a positive feedback mechanism will result that again could cause fibrosis to spread outward from the site of initiation .",
    "the value of @xmath0 in _ rule 2 _ essentially controls the feedback gain .",

    "the colors represent the magnitude of the spring force , varying from blue ( low ) to red ( high ) .",
    "scarring patterns , as those seen in figure  [ f.images ] , are better represented when random walk ( @xmath21 ) is included in the model . ]    at every step following the application of _ rule 1 _ and _ rule 2 _ , we use a method based on _ simulated annealing _",
    "@xcite to determine the configuration of the network for which its total energy , @xmath22 , is minimized .",
    "the configuration of the network is defined by the positions of its nodes ( the points where the springs interconnect ) .",
    "@xmath22 is given by the sum of the elastic energies in all the springs in the network , i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the extension and stiffness , respectively , of the @xmath26 spring .",
    "starting from some initial configuration , we determine the equilibrium ( energy minimizing ) configuration in an iterative procedure as follows . at each step in the procedure ,",
    "each non - fixed node is allowed to move by a small amount in the direction of the resultant force exerted on it by the three springs to which it is connected .",
    "this causes @xmath22 to change by a small amount @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath27 is negative ( i.e. energy is less in the new configuration ) then the new configuration is accepted .",
    "if @xmath27 is positive then the new configuration is accepted with a small probability given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a control parameter .",
    "this occasional acceptance of increased energy configurations allows the system the chance to escape from local energy minima in search of the global minimum .",
    "we repeated this stochastic process until @xmath30 remained below @xmath31 for 20 consecutive iterations , at which point we considered the algorithm to have converged .",
    "we performed this energy minimization procedure only after the completion of each random walk , which assumes that any network configurations taking place during the walk did not influence the walk itself .",
    "we simulated networks of @xmath32 nodes , as shown in figure  [ f.mt ] which illustrates the influence of @xmath0 on the macroscopic appearance of the fibrotic regions .",
    "each curve in this and the other figures presented below was obtained by first determining the bulk modulus for 30 independent network realizations for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "linear interpolation was then applied to each relationship to determine the value of the bulk modulus at a fixed set of equally spaced values of @xmath33 . finally , the 30 interpolated relationships were ensemble averaged .",
    "comparison of figures  [ f.images ] and [ f.mt ] suggests that @xmath18 gives rise to more realistic scarring patterns than does @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath1 is normalized by the maximum value of the bulk modulus , @xmath34 , when all springs are stiff ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "three regimes of mechanical behavior can be distinguished according to the concentration : @xmath3 ( region i ) ; @xmath7 ( region",
    "ii ) ; and @xmath11 ( region iii ) .",
    "each of these regions presents a particular growth behavior for @xmath1 .",
    "the solid line is a straight line between the coordinates ( 0.65,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) . ]",
    "in order to quantify how spatial correlations in the growth of fibrotic regions affect the stiffness of the entire spring network , we calculated the two - dimensional averaged bulk modulus , @xmath36 , of the network as a function of the fraction , @xmath2 , of stiffened springs for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 spans the range from 0 ( completely healthy tissue ) to 1 ( entirely fibrotic tissue ) . for each realization ,",
    "the bulk modulus was computed for each value of @xmath0 and @xmath2 by temporarily increasing the network boundaries in both directions by 0.001% and finding the stretched equilibrium configuration .",
    "the bulk modulus was then taken as the ratio of the change in stress to the change in the area defined by the network boundaries following stretch .",
    "the bulk modulus is thus equivalent to the inverse of specific lung compliance used in physiological studies .",
    "note that @xmath37 is determined using _ rule 1 _ because only the initial seed spring is stiffened at each step in this rule , while @xmath1 for @xmath21 is determined using both _ rule 1 _ and _ rule 2_. we also define @xmath38 as the minimum value of @xmath36 that pertains to the healthy network containing only soft springs , while @xmath34 is the maximum @xmath36 that occurs when all the springs have been stiffened .",
    "these two constants , @xmath38 and @xmath34 , apply only to fully homogeneous networks and , therefore , are independent on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , since we considered only hookean springs , we have that @xmath39 .",
    "we find that @xmath1 segregates into three distinct regimes ( see figure  [ f.bulkmod ] ) ; region i corresponds to @xmath3 , region ii corresponds to @xmath7 , and region iii corresponds to @xmath11 . in regions i and ii",

    "note that equation  [ e.bnii ] can not be partitioned into two independent terms , such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the case of region i. the reason is that in region ii , the fibrosis is extensive enough that fibrotic clusters have a high likelihood of intersecting and this produces a nonlinear coupling between percolation and random walk in the growth equation .",
    "when @xmath2 exceeds 0.8 , @xmath1 converges toward a single relationship with @xmath2 for all values of @xmath0 ( figure  [ f.bulkmod ] ) .",

    "intriguingly , @xmath19 is approximately the location of the percolation threshold for a 2d hexagonal networks  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath1 in region iii may have less clinical relevance than that in regions i and ii because patients might not be able to survive into region iii .",
    "nevertheless , our goal here is to understand the behavior of @xmath1 over its entire operating range .",
    "next , we analyze the distribution of spring forces within the network .",
    "figure  [ f.forces](a ) shows histograms of force for @xmath15 and 100 , and for @xmath14 , 0.65 and 0.8 .",
    "the figure also indicates with a dotted and dashed vertical line the single value of spring force in the homogeneous networks when @xmath42 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath14 , the force distribution follows a power law with an exponent @xmath67 that increases from -4.36 at @xmath15 toward a plateau of about -2 for @xmath68 , as shown in figure  [ f.forces](b ) .",
    "hence , for large @xmath0 the force distribution develops an extended tail that leads to some regions of the network bearing more force than occurs even when the network is fully fibrotic ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "these high force regions correspond to single stiff springs that connect between clusters of fibrotic regions , similarly to the red bonds in regular percolation  @xcite .    , i.e. , @xmath15 ( circles ) and @xmath18 ( squares ) , and for @xmath14 ( red ) , @xmath19 ( green ) , and @xmath20 ( blue ) .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines show the value of the spring forces in the homogeneous networks with @xmath42 and @xmath35 , respectively . in graph ( b ) , we show how the power law exponent , @xmath67 , for @xmath14 , changes with @xmath0 . for @xmath68",

    ", @xmath67 fluctuates around -2.,title=\"fig:\",width=287 ]    as @xmath2 increases , however , @xmath0 loses importance in determining how the force is distributed , as shown in figure  [ f.forces](a ) , and as also occurred with @xmath1 ( region iii of figure  [ f.bulkmod ] ) .",
    "additionally , for @xmath69 , a gaussian - like peak emerges in the force distributions to the right of the power law decay , as shown in figure  [ f.forces](a ) .",
    "thus , the spring force distribution can be seen to progress through a series of stages as fibrosis develops in the network . beginning with the single spring force of the healthy network , region",
    "i is accompanied by a progressively flattening power law force distribution . in region",
    "ii the power law distribution starts to give way to a broad rightward peak .",
    "eventually , in region iii , this peak narrows to converge on the single spring force of the fully fibrotic network .",
    "the model of pf we have examined here is obviously based on an extremely simple representation of real lung tissue , so we must view our results accordingly .",
    "what these simplifications probably mean is that although the some of the general aspects of our results may pertain to reality , the details may not . thus , for example , it is reasonable to think that the nonlinear relationship we found between the stiffening of springs and changes in @xmath1 ( figure  [ f.bulkmod ] ) is likely to be mirrored in a nonlinear link between the development of pf and clinical symptoms .",
    "similarly , the finding of three distinct regimes in mechanical behavior ( our regions i , ii and iii ) may also find analogs in reality because these regions are defined by whether or not developing clusters of fibrosis start to encroach on the same regions of tissue , a rather general phenomenon . we would thus expect that at low fibrotic densities we would still find in an actual lung that the effects of seeding density and cluster size are separable in the manner of equation  [ e.bni ] . on the other hand , precisely where regions i , ii and iii occur relative to the progression of pf , or exactly what their respective force distributions look like , are details that probably differ between our model and a real fibrotic lung .",
    "a better representation of reality could be achieved by certain modifications to the model .",
    "for example , our network model is 2-dimensional whereas lung tissue is a 3-dimensional system in which alveolar walls are more properly considered as elastic membranes rather than line elements .",
    "extending our analysis to 3-dimensions is possible , in principle , and might prove useful for future investigations as high - resolution 3-dimensional images of pf progression become available .",
    "indeed , we have previously used a 3-dimensional network model to investigate how the alveolar architecture structure is destroyed in emphysema  @xcite .",
    "another simplification in our model is the assumption that alveolar wall elements act as hookean springs .",
    "this assumption of purely elastic behavior is a simplification given that real tissue is viscoelastic , although the long time scales over which pf develops probably mean that the elastic assumption is adequate .",
    "the assumption that the elasticity is linear is more questionable , given that lung tissue exhibits marked strain stiffening .",
    "our model thus represents a low strain view `` zeroth''-order approach of lung stiffness . extending the model to include",
    "nonlinear stress - strain behavior in the spring elements would probably not affect our overall conclusions , but would certainly affect the details of predicted force distributions  @xcite .",
    "finally , we simplified the process of fibrogenesis by increasing spring constants by a single factor of 100 , thereby creating a binary stiffness map across the network , whereas it has been shown recently  @xcite that the distribution of local stiffness in the fibrotic lung is wide . while likely affecting the predicted distributions of forces within the network , this assumption was made in the interest of creating a simple model capable of yielding appropriate qualitative behavior that can be readily interpreted in terms of the interactions among its constituents .",
    "in this study , we used a simple spring network model of the lung parenchyma to investigate how lung stiffness grows as a function of the degree to which the deposition of collagen is spatially correlated during the progression of pf .",
    "we simulated the progression of fibrosis in terms of two simple growth rules , percolation and random walk , with the degree of spatial correlation of collagen deposition being determined by the length of the random walk .",
    "surprisingly , we found that the bulk stiffness of the elastic network as a function of the amount of collagen deposition could be described by a set of three simple empirical equations ( equations  [ e.bni ] , [ e.bnii ] and [ e.bniii ] ) , demonstrating an underlying simplicity to the way in which percolation and random walk affect overall system behavior .    with respect to the relation between percolation and random walk",
    ", we note the following . creating clusters around randomly selected points should not change the universality class of critical properties , since",
    ", for infinite systems , the size of such clusters can always be reduced to single points .",
    "however , we aimed at investigating the bulk modulus behavior when stiff clusters emerge and grow until they fill the entire network , rather than focusing only on the critical behavior at the percolation threshold . moreover , bulk modulus , far away from the criticality , depends not only on the concentration of stiff springs but is also highly dependent on how clusters of stiff springs spread through the network .",
    "therefore , our results can not be predicted by finite - size scaling analysis alone .    finally , we speculate that the random walk rule may represent the homeostatic response of collagen producing cells to changes in local stiffness as a result of the stiffening of nearby regions of tissue .",
    "we also found that when @xmath2 is small , longer random walks lead to greater heterogeneity in force distribution throughout the network characterized by power laws .",
    "small values of @xmath2 are probably the most physiologically relevant because they represent the early to moderates stage of fibrotic disease where patients might be expected to survive .",
    "these results thus suggest the possibility that fibrotic remodeling in the lung develops in part as the result of positive feedback between collagen deposition and its consequent effects on the local mechanical micro environment in the lung .    supported by nih hl-098976 .",
