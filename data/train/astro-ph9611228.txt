    "flat models with a contribution from a cosmological constant @xmath11 seem to be consistent with the data .",
    "models in which the fluctuations originate from cosmic strings appear to be consistent with the observations if we do not consider the higher calibration saskatoon data .",

    "we consider all the latest cmb measurements , including new results from cobe , tenerife , max , saskatoon and cat , with the exception of the msam results and the max detection in the mu pegasi region ( for details on data selection see hancock _ et  al . _",
    "we also consider all 8 multipole bands of the angular power spectrum extracted from the 4-year cobe data @xcite . in order to avoid eventual correlations between these data points",
    "we have applied the fitting analysis to the 4 even or 4 odd multipole bands in conjunction with the remaining data points .",
    "the results are similar whether we use the even or the odd multipoles .",

    "[ fig : windows1 ] . on the left hand side we present the window functions for 4 of the 8 multipoles of the cobe experiment .",

    "the uncertainties of the intrinsic anisotropy level have been calculated using a likelihood analysis ( see _ e.g.  _ hancock _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) , which incorporates uncertainties due to random errors , theoretical uncertainty ( cosmic variance ) @xcite and enhancement of cosmic variance due to partial sky coverage ( sample variance ) @xcite .",
    "the errors in @xmath30 quoted in column 3 are 68 % confidence limits and have been obtained by averaging the difference in the reported 68 % upper and lower limits and the best fit @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure introduces a small bias into the results since the likelihood function is in general only an approximation to a gaussian distribution .",
    "for a given theoretical model it is possible to compute the value of @xmath31 one would expect to observe using the angular power spectrum @xmath18 s as predicted by the model and the window function corresponding to the experimental configuration @xmath26 .",
    "we convert this to the bandpower equivalent result @xmath30 and compare with @xmath32 .",
    "we then compute the chi - squared for this set of @xmath18 s for the nd data points in table  1 , and the relative likelihood function is formed according to : @xmath33 ( for details see hancock _",
    "et  al . _",
    "as mentioned above the process by which the error bars quoted in table 1 are computed introduces a small bias into the results . in order to assess the significance of this we applied the fitting analysis to an alternative set of data which consisted of the mean value of the data and corresponding error bars .",
    "we find no significant difference in the results obtained .",
    "we also vary the power spectrum normalization within the 95% limits for the cobe 4-year data @xcite .",
    "the data included in the fit are those from table 1 , which , with the exception of saskatoon , include uncertainties in the overall calibration .",
    "there is a @xmath34 calibration error in the saskatoon data , but since the saskatoon points are not independent this will apply equally to all five points @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function is evaluated for three cases : ( i ) that the calibration is correct , ( ii ) the calibration is the lowest allowed value and ( iii ) the calibration is the maximum allowed value .",
    "we consider that a given model offers an acceptable chi - squared fit when @xmath35 .",
    "we have applied the analysis to the cobe normalised flat cdm models ( provided by g. efstathiou ) considering only one multipole for cobe namely @xmath36 obtained from the value of the @xmath37 .",
    "the models offering an acceptable chi - squared fit ( @xmath38 ) to the cmb power spectrum whilst simultaneously satisfying nucleosynthesis constraints @xcite , comprehend @xmath39 , @xmath40 . considering the highest saskatoon data calibration the constraints become @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "allowing for the lowest saskatoon data calibration relaxes the constraints up to @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see hancock _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in general , recent optical and sunyaev - zeldovich observations of the hubble constant @xcite imply in the range @xmath45 .    applying this analysis to the open models we conclude that @xmath46 is not compatible with the data , while the value of @xmath47 is only allowed for the lower saskatoon calibration data .",
    "a value of @xmath48 offers an acceptable chi - squared fitting for both case ( i ) and ( ii ) calibrations .",
    "this confirms the results obtained using the approximate formula of hancock _",
    "_ reassuring us that the generalized parametrized formula previously used constitutes a good approximation given the uncertainties in the data .",
    "the models with low @xmath4 and a non - zero cosmological constant @xmath11 seem to be consistent with the data , with large values of @xmath11 providing the best fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : models1 ] left hand side we present the best candidates of both the open and @xmath11 models compared with a flat cdm model with @xmath49 and @xmath50 assuming case ( i ) calibration .",

    "texture models are also only allowed if one considers the lower calibration for the saskatoon data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : models1 ] right hand side we present a cosmic string model and the best candidate of the texture models ( with @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) for comparison with the flat cdm model of fig .",

    "the fitting for the spectral index @xmath24 of the primordial fluctuations was done considering two sets of data : ( a ) one multipole , ( b ) 4 multipole bands for the cobe experiment and case ( i ) for the calibration . for case",
    "( a ) we get for model ( 1 ) a value of @xmath57 , for model ( 2 ) @xmath58 and for model ( 3 ) @xmath59 . for case ( b )",
    "we find for model ( 1 ) @xmath60 , for model ( 2 ) @xmath59 and for model ( 3 ) @xmath61 ( 68 % confidence interval ) . allowing for the three calibration cases and taking extreme limits",
    "the uncertainties are altered as follows : for case ( a ) for model ( 1 ) @xmath62 , model ( 2 ) @xmath63 and model ( 3 ) @xmath64 while for case ( b ) for model ( 1 ) @xmath65 , model ( 2 ) @xmath66 and model ( 3 ) @xmath67 .",
    "in particular fixing @xmath68 we find @xmath9 ( 68 % confidence interval ) allowing for the three calibration cases and taking extreme limits .",
    "this tight limit rules out a significant contribution from gravity wave background for these models , in the case of power law inflation , but is consistent with the prediction of @xmath10 for scalar fluctuations generated by inflation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt1 ] left hand side we present the model ( 3 ) and its 68 % confidence interval assuming the case ( i ) for the calibration . on the right hand side",
