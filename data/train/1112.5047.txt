    "this lemma sets the theme for our paper , namely that certain polytope properties ( in this case , being an edge polytope ) are well - behaved under decomposition when we restrict to edge polytopes .",

    "recall that @xmath86 has all the zero and positive edges and @xmath87 has all the zero and negative edges .",
    "suppose that both @xmath92 and @xmath94 are normal but @xmath3 is not .",
    "it follows from the odd cycle condition that @xmath0 contains two disjoint odd cycles @xmath34 and @xmath210 with no bridge . without loss of generality , we may assume that these are minimal in the sense that we can not pick a smaller odd cycle to replace @xmath34 while keeping @xmath210 fixed such that they are still disjoint and bridgeless ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "in particular , it follows that neither cycle contains a chord , since then a smaller odd cycle could have been selected .",
    "if either @xmath86 or @xmath87 contains all the edges in both cycles , then @xmath3 can not be normal .",
    "thus there is at least one positive and at least one negative edge in the edges of @xmath34 and @xmath210 .",
    "if they are in the same cycle @xmath34 , then since the two edges induce a cycle of length @xmath23 , @xmath34 must have a chord , a contradiction .",
    "if they are in different cycles , then a cycle of length @xmath23 between them introduces two bridges that are zero edges , which is also a contradiction .",
    "thus @xmath3 is normal .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath3 is normal and that @xmath92 is nonnormal .",
    "since @xmath3 is normal , there is at least one bridge between @xmath34 and @xmath210 in @xmath0 .",
    "again by the odd cycle condition , the subgraph @xmath86 contains two disjoint odd cycles @xmath34 and @xmath210 such that no bridge between @xmath34 and @xmath210 belongs to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , all of the bridges between @xmath34 and @xmath210 in @xmath0 must be negative edges .",
    "we claim all of the edges of @xmath34 and @xmath210 must be zero edges .",
    "in fact , if we had an edge @xmath36 of either @xmath34 or @xmath210 which is nonzero , then since @xmath36 belongs to @xmath86 it must be positive , and a cycle of length @xmath23 arises from @xmath36 and a ( negative ) bridge , yielding a zero edge bridge between @xmath34 and @xmath210 , a contradiction .",
    "now , let @xmath215 define the separating hyperplane @xmath16 . since all of the edges of @xmath34 and @xmath210 must be zero edges , one has @xmath216 if @xmath217 is an edge of either @xmath34 or @xmath210 .",
    "however , since both @xmath34 and @xmath210 are odd , it follows that @xmath218 for all vertices @xmath9 of @xmath34 and @xmath210 .",
    "hence there exists no negative bridge between @xmath34 and @xmath210 , which gives a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath92 is normal .",
    "similarly , @xmath94 is normal .",
    "[ nan : example ]    _ when @xmath3 is not normal , different types of decompositions can occur , as shown in the following examples : _    1 .",
