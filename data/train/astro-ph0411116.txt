    "relativistic tori ( i.e. geometrically thick discs ) orbiting around black holes are expected to form in a number of different scenarios , such as after the gravitational collapse of the core of a rotating massive star ( @xmath1 ) or after a neutron star binary merger .",
    "state - of - the - art numerical simulations of these scenarios , both in newtonian physics @xcite , as well as in a relativistic framework @xcite , have shown that under certain conditions , a massive disc may be produced .",
    "this disc surrounds the newly formed black hole , has large average rest - mass densities and highly super - eddington mass fluxes , and its angular momentum obeys a sub - keplerian distribution .",
    "accretion tori of much smaller accretion rates have also been considered in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion flows onto kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons for considering these objects astrophysically interesting .",
    "one of the most important reason has to do with the idea that an accreting torus around a black hole generated after neutron star coalescence could be the progenitor source for short duration , ( i.e. @xmath2 s ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , where the relativistic fireball expands along the rotation axis with very low baryonic contamination  @xcite ( see @xcite for recent relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of such a scenario ) .",
    "correspondingly , in the `` collapsar '' scenario , the core of a massive rotating star collapses to form a rotating black hole  @xcite which subsequently grows accreting the surrounding envelope of the star through a geometrically thick disc . an energetic , long - duration ( i.e. @xmath3 s )",
    "grb accompanied by a type ib / ic supernova may be produced as a result of such ( thick ) disc accretion process . as in the neutron star merging scenario , part of the large amounts of the energy released by accretion",
    "is deposited in the low - density region along the rotation axis of the star , where the heated gas expands in a jet - like fireball ( see @xcite for numerical simulations of this process ) .    even in the absence of other potential instabilities triggered by nonaxisymmetric perturbations or magnetic fields ,",
    "the accretion torus that forms in the aforementioned catastrophic events is likely to be accreting on to the black hole with rates which largely exceed the eddington rate , a property which may lead to the rapid destruction of the disc . such a possibility was first suggested by @xcite , who pointed out how the equilibrium solution of a barotropic fluid orbiting a black hole with a general , non - keplerian rotation law might be hydrodynamically unstable .",
    "the outermost closed equipotential surface of the torus has a distinctive cusp at the inner edge through which mass transfer can be driven by small changes in the pressure gradient there ( in a stationary situation the pressure gradient at the cusp would be exactly zero ) .",
    "the instability is driven by the progressive penetration of the cusp into the disc as a result of the accretion of mass and angular momentum and of the corresponding increase of mass and spin of the black hole . during the development of the instability the mass flux increases exponentially and",
    "leads to the complete disappearance of the disc into the black hole on a dynamical timescale , justifying why it is usually referred to as the `` runaway instability '' .",
    "axisymmetric , general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of this process have been performed only recently @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the disc is assumed to be non - selfgravitating and the relativistic hydrodynamics equations are then evolved in time in the curved spacetime of the black hole .",
    "the latter is instantaneously modified to new stationary solutions as the mass and spin of the black hole gradually increase as a result of accretion . while this is clearly an approximation to solving the full einstein equations , it is a reasonable one when the disc - to - hole mass ratio is _ small enough _ and the changes in the spacetime between two successive timelevels is correspondingly small . within this approximation",
    "the numerical simulations have shown that while thick discs with a _ constant _ distribution of the specific angular momentum are subject to the runaway instability irrespective of the initial conditions @xcite , a small departure from a constant distribution of angular momentum ( namely , a power - law increase with the radial distance with a small index ) suffices to prevent the development of the instability  @xcite .",
    "this result is in agreement with perturbative calculations of radially oscillating tori which indicate that the oscillations have eigenfunctions that are significantly modified at the inner edge when the specific angular momentum is not constant @xcite .",
    "however , no definitive conclusion can be made yet on the occurrence of the runaway instability as there are at least two other physical processes that could play some role .",
    "one of these is provided by the self - gravity of the disc which , from studies based on sequences of stationary models has been shown to favour the instability @xcite ; the other one is brought up by the presence of magnetic fields that would affect globally the properties of accretion flows and the angular momentum transport in discs surrounding black holes .",
    "magnetic fields are indeed expected to influence significantly the physics of accretion discs , either geometrically thin or thick , in many respects , well beyond the issue of the runaway instability .",
    "in particular , the impact of magnetic fields in the dynamics of accretion flows has been recognized in a large number of works , but only recently the first magnetohydrodynamical simulations in the relativistic regime have become available ( but see @xcite for earlier investigations ) .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have started programs to perform realistic simulations of magnetically driven accretion flows in rotating black hole spacetimes .",
    "a fundamental idea under intense scrutiny is that the combined presence of a magnetic field and of a differentially rotating fluid , in particular a keplerian disc , can lead to the so called magnetorotational instability ( see @xcite for a review ) , generating an effective viscosity and thus transporting angular momentum outward through magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .    notwithstanding that magnetic fields play an important role in accretion theory ,",
    "two new interesting results have emerged recently in purely hydrodynamical axisymmetric simulations .",
    "both of them refer to the evidence that upon the introduction of perturbations stable relativistic tori manifest a regular , long - term oscillating behaviour .",
    "this , in turn , is responsible for the periodic changes of the mass quadrupole moment of the discs , thus making these objects promising new sources of detectable gravitational radiation .",
    "this is particularly true when the average density in the discs is close to nuclear matter density  @xcite , as it is the case in discs formed as a result of binary neutron star coalescence .",
    "in addition , when the thick discs are composed of the low - density material stripped from the secondary star in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , their oscillations could help explaining the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( hfqpos ) observed in the spectra of x - ray binaries  @xcite . in a model proposed recently and based on the evidence that tori around black holes have the fundamental mode of oscillation and the first overtones in the harmonic sequence @xmath4 to a good precision and in a very wide parameter space , the hfqpos are explained in terms of @xmath0-mode oscillations of a small - size accretion torus orbiting around the black hole ( see also abramowicz & kluniak 2004 for a recent review on the phenomenology associated with hfqpos and for alternative models ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of the dynamics of axisymmetric relativistic tori carried out by @xcite ( henceforth paper i ) , in which the attention was limited to models with _ constant _ specific angular momentum orbiting around a _ schwarzschild _ ( nonrotating ) black hole .",
    "now we consider the more general case of _ nonconstant _ angular momentum thick discs in the rotating background spacetime provided by the _ kerr _",
    "furthermore , since the results reported recently by  @xcite pose limits on the occurrence of the runaway instability in the case of non self - gravitating , nonconstant angular momentum discs , we do not investigate this issue further here .",
    "instead , we focus on the study of the oscillating behaviour of marginally stable discs . to this aim",
    "we combine two complementary tools : nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations and a linear perturbative approach . with the first one we can follow the long - term evolution of perturbed thick accretion discs , analyze their dynamics , and compute the gravitational wave emission in the newtonian quadrupole approximation .",
    "correspondingly , with the second approach we can investigate how the oscillation properties of these objects depend on their geometrical features , surveying a very large parameter space .",
    "when applied to vertically integrated relativistic tori , this second approach has already shown its utility for explaining the results of the numerical simulations of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ii ] we briefly review the main properties of relativistic tori which obey a power - law angular momentum distribution .",
    "next , in section  [ iii ] , we present the two mathematical approaches used in our investigation , namely the techniques for the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations and the basic aspects related with the solution of the eigenvalue problem in the linear perturbative framework .",
    "section  [ iv ] presents the initial models , while section  [ v ] contains the discussion on the results .",
    "finally , section  [ vi ] is devoted to the conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we use a space - like signature @xmath5 and a system of geometrized units in which @xmath6 .",
    "the unit of length is chosen to be the gravitational radius of the black hole , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of the black hole .",
    "greek indeces run from 0 to 3 and latin indeces from 1 to 3 .",
    "the procedure for building a stationary and axisymmetric fluid configuration orbiting around a kerr black hole and obeying a power - law distribution of the specific angular momentum in the equatorial plane has been reviewed in great detail by @xcite . here , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will only recall those definitions and physical properties that are essential to the present study . in what follows we consider a perfect fluid described by the stress - energy tensor @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the coefficients of the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath0",
    ", @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the energy density , the isotropic pressure , the rest - mass density , and the specific enthalpy , respectively , each of them measured in the frame comoving with the fluid . the fluid is supposed to obey a polytropic equation of state @xmath15 ( eos ) , where @xmath16 is the polytropic constant and @xmath17 is the adiabatic index .",
    "we use @xmath18 to denote the angular velocity of the fluid and @xmath19 to denote its specific angular momentum .",
    "moreover , the rotation law on the equatorial plane is given by a power - law distribution of the specific angular momentum @xmath20 where @xmath21 can be either positive or negative , according to the disc rotation being prograde or retrograde , respectively , with respect to the black hole rotation .",
    "when the motion of the fluid is just circular and does not change in time ( i.e. @xmath22 ) , the relativistic euler equations in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions are given by the ( bernoulli - type ) equilibrium conditions @xmath25 where the right - hand - side is nothing but the opposite of the relativistic four acceleration @xmath26 , which vanishes in the case of a purely geodetic motion ) implies that a stationary and axisymmetric circular motion of a perfect fluid is geodesic if and only if it follows a keplerian rotation law . ] .",
    "the procedure for solving eq .",
    "( [ bernoulli ] ) exploits the fact that the surfaces of constant @xmath27 ( the so - called von zeipel cylinders ) coincide with the surfaces of constant @xmath28 ( see @xcite for details ) , a result which holds true only for a barotropic fluid @xcite .",
    "one of the most relevant features of the equilibrium solution , irrespective of the distribution of the angular momentum , is that the resulting thick disc can have two keplerian points on the equatorial plane ( i.e. points where the rotation law is that of the keplerian motion ) : the first one is the cusp , through which matter can accrete onto the black hole , and the second one marks the position of the maximum rest - mass density .",
    "however , while in the case of a constant angular momentum @xmath28 the position of the cusp @xmath29 is always smaller than the marginally stable orbit @xmath30 , when the angular momentum is not constant , it may also happen that @xmath31 , depending on the choice of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ power_law ] ) .    among the large family of initial configurations that are in principle possible ,",
    "we only consider those that possess a cusp , a centre , and with a closed equipotential through the cusp .",
    "this only happens when @xmath33 and when @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two limiting values defined in @xcite ( the subindex ` mb ' refers to the marginally bound orbit ) . also note that relativistic tori with @xmath28 following a power - law generally have larger sizes than constant angular momentum tori , a fact which can produce initial models with central densities one or two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the results we report in this paper are based on two complementary approaches involving both nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations and the solution of the eigenvalue problem within a perturbative linear analysis .",
    "we recall in what follows the basic aspects related to both of them .",
    "the nonlinear , axisymmetric , general relativistic code used in the simulations we report is an extended version of the one presented by @xcite which incorporates the effects of a rotating background spacetime . in this code",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are implemented as a first - order , flux - conservative system according to the formulation developed by @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of this system of equations for the kerr metric can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the equations are solved using a high - resolution shock - capturing scheme based on an approximate riemann solver ( either hlle or marquina s ) .",
    "second - order accuracy in both space and time is achieved by adopting a piecewise - linear cell reconstruction procedure and a second order , conservative runge - kutta scheme , respectively .",
    "the computational grid consists of @xmath37 zones in the radial and angular directions , respectively .",
    "the innermost zone of the radial grid is placed at @xmath38 , while the outermost radial grid point is at a distance about @xmath39 larger than the outer radius of the torus , @xmath40 . while @xmath41 depends on the particular model considered ,",
    "it is typically @xmath42 or smaller .",
    "the radial grid is built by joining smoothly two patches obtained using two different algorithms .",
    "the first part extends from @xmath43 to the outer radius of the torus .",
    "it is logarithmically spaced and has the maximum radial resolution at the innermost grid zone , @xmath44 .",
    "the spacing of the second part of the radial grid is uniform and it extends up to @xmath45 .",
    "the total number of radial grid points @xmath46 is selected so as to have a radial resolution at the outer boundary @xmath47 .",
    "typically , we use @xmath48 for the more compact tori ( radial length @xmath49 ) , while @xmath50 for the more extended models . the angular grid , on the other hand , which consists of @xmath51 zones in all of the simulations , covers the domain from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "as customary for finite difference hydrodynamical codes which can not handle vacuum regions , a low density `` atmosphere '' is introduced in those parts of the numerical domain not occupied by the torus . in all our simulations",
    "we have chosen a special version of the spherically accreting solution described by @xcite , suitably modified to account for the rotation of the black hole ( see appendix  a for a detailed description ) . since this atmosphere",
    "is evolved as the rest of the fluid , one should simply take care that its dynamics does not interfere with that of the object being studied .",
    "we have verified that this is indeed the case if the maximum density of the atmosphere is @xmath54 orders of magnitude smaller than the central density of the torus .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we are not interested here in the study of the runaway instability but rather we focus on the oscillation properties of thick discs filling their outermost closed equipotential surface ( we also refer to these discs as `` marginally stable '' ) . hence , we assume that the background spacetime is simply the one provided by the kerr metric and that it does not change during the evolution ; this prevents the development of the instability @xcite by construction .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in the present context for two different reasons .",
    "the first one is that most of the tori we evolve have rest masses @xmath55 which are much smaller than that of the black hole ( i.e. @xmath56 ) .",
    "hence , we can neglect their contribution to the overall gravitational field when compared to that created by the black hole .",
    "the second reason is that a small power - law index @xmath32 in the angular momentum distribution is enough to reduce significantly the amount of rest - mass accreted onto the black hole so that , effectively , the mass and spin of the black hole do not change significantly over the timescale of our simulations .",
    "this was shown numerically by @xcite , @xcite and explained in the perturbative analysis by @xcite . to validate this approximation we monitor the rest - mass accreted by the black hole according to the formula @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the determinant of the metric and where @xmath59 is the radius of the innermost radial cell .",
    "similarly , we monitor the angular momentum flux across the horizon as @xmath60 note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eqs .",
    "( [ fl1 ] ) and ( [ fl2 ] ) are the lorentz factor and the coordinate radial velocity , respectively , as measured by the zero angular momentum observer .",
    "in all of the simulations performed here the global relative changes in the black hole mass and spin resulting from accretion are @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the assumption of a fixed spacetime is accurate and justified .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from nonconstant specific angular momentum tori undergoing axisymmetric oscillations while orbiting around kerr black holes .",
    "the angular momentum distribution has been chosen to be increasing outward with the radial distance following a power - law dependence .",
    "the self - gravity of the discs has been neglected and the accretion of mass and angular momentum has been assumed not to affect the underlying background metric . we have also removed the possible role played by the runaway instability by selecting indeces in the power - law distribution of the specific angular momentum that are above the critical value for the instability ( cf .",
    "the results presented in this paper have thus extended the previous investigation of  @xcite where constant specific angular momentum discs around schwarzschild black holes were considered .    a comprehensive sample of initial ( marginally stable ) equilibrium tori has been built .",
    "these tori have been subsequently perturbed in various ways in order to study their dynamical response to the perturbations during long - term time evolutions ( extending up to 100 orbital periods for each model ) .",
    "the time evolutions are characterized by a distinctive quasi - periodic pattern present in all fluid quantities as well as in the mass and angular momentum accretion rates and in the gravitational waveforms ( which have been extracted using the newtonian quadrupole formula ) .",
    "our study has been carried out using two complementary tools : an axisymmetric nonlinear hydrodynamics code and a linear perturbative code for vertically integrated axisymmetric tori .",
    "while the first one has proven useful to investigate nonlinear effects in the axisymmetric oscillation , the second approach has been useful in confirming and interpreting the numerical simulations .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows : the power - law angular momentum distribution results in more stable tori than in the uniform angular momentum case , yielding systematically smaller values of the mass accretion rate as the power - law index increases .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous studies of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the eigenfrequencies calculated through the perturbative analysis and those obtained from the power spectra of the hydrodynamical variables in the numerical simulations have shown a good agreement between the two approaches for the first two modes @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "they have been found close to a simple sequence of integers 2:3 , but with deviations that become significant as the power - law index @xmath32 increases .",
    "namely , for @xmath66 the ratio @xmath67 differs from @xmath68 by @xmath69 . on the other hand ,",
    "the second overtone @xmath70 predicted by the perturbative analysis could be detected only in two cases among the several power spectra calculated from the hydrodynamical models .",
    "this is either due to the limitations of the vertically integrated assumption in the perturbative analysis in capturing higher frequency oscillations ( something which is also confirmed when performing selective excitations of modes ) , or by the very small power confined in these modes which prevents them to become visible in the power spectra .",
    "the comparison has also shown that the peak found at @xmath71 in the power spectra should not be interpreted as a proper eigenmode of the system .",
    "rather , it represents the result of a nonlinear coupling of the lower - order modes as it is common in nonlinear systems subject to nonharmonic oscillations .",
    "finally , we have reported on the detectability of the oscillations of perturbed tori via their gravitational wave emission . in good agreement with what we already found for constant angular momentum discs , the chances for detection of gravitational radiation from nonconstant angular momentum tori , when sufficiently compact and dense , are good and within the sensitivity curves of ligo and virgo for galactic sources , but only marginal even for advanced ligo for extragalactic sources located at 20 mpc .",
    "extensions of the work reported here include the incorporation of additional physics in the models such as viscosity and magnetic fields and will be reported in forthcoming papers .",
