    "the application of quantum field theory to curved space has resulted in a large array of interesting and important results .",
    "these include black hole evaporation@xcite and its implications for black hole thermodynamics@xcite , the dissipation of anisotropy by particle production in cosmological spacetimes@xcite , and the removal of cosmological singularities by vacuum polarization effects@xcite .",
    "one of the places for which quantum effects have been studied the least is the interior of a black hole .",
    "one might think that such studies are not interesting because no observer from the exterior region can probe the interior region unless they choose to fall into the hole .",
    "however the existence of black hole evaporation makes it quite possible to eventually learn about quantum effects in the interior of a black hole .",
    "this is because as a black hole evaporates more and more of its interior is exposed .",
    "thus not only can quantum effects in the interior of a black hole eventually be detected , they may have a significant influence on the evaporation process .",
    "quantum effects in the interior may in fact have a direct bearing on two of the most fundamental outstanding issues relating to the quantum mechanics of black holes .",
    "one of these is the question of what happens during the late stages of black hole evaporation , that is , what is the end point of the evaporation process ? the other is the question of what happens to the information about how the black hole formed .",
    "there are at least two ways in which quantum effects in the interior could affect the answers to these questions .",
    "one is that if quantum effects remove the singularity predicted by general relativity then it is very likely that the evolution will be unitary and information will not be destroyed .",
    "a second possibility is that quantum effects could cause the evaporation process to cease leaving a zero temperature black hole remnant .",
    "if the remnant has an event horizon the information would very likely be trapped inside the black hole . since the temperature of a black hole is determined by the surface gravity at its horizon and",
    "since the evaporation process causes the horizon to be at points which were previously in the ( apparent ) interior , it is clear that the geometry of the interior is likely to influence the evaporation process as it progresses .",
    "one interesting quantum effect that seems likely to occur inside the horizon of a black hole is the dissipation of anisotropy and possibly inhomogeneity due to particle production .",
    "this is because the interior of such a black hole can be thought of as an anisotropic and possibly inhomogeneous cosmology .",
    "for example the interior of a schwarzschild black hole can be thought of as a homogeneous , anisotropic cosmology of the kantowski - sachs family@xcite .",
    "it has been well established that particle production dissipates anisotropy in bianchi type i spacetimes@xcite . if the process of anisotropy dissipation occurs it will certainly alter the geometry in the interior of a black hole .    for these reasons",
    "it is interesting to examine quantum effects in the interior of a black hole .",
    "to do so for either the interior or exterior of an evaporating black hole would be an enormously difficult task at present due to problems that one would encounter in computing the stress - energy tensors for quantized fields in the relevant spacetime .",
    "however , computing the stress - energy tensors for these fields in the case of a spherically symmetric black hole in thermal equilibrium with radiation in a cavity , _",
    "i.e. , _ with the fields in the hartle - hawking state , is a much more tractable problem .",
    "the reason is that there are then three killing vector fields in the spacetime , which makes the mode equations separable .    for a black hole in equilibrium with fields in the hartle - hawking state , analytical approximations for the stress - energy tensors of various types of quantized fields",
    "have been obtained .",
    "the derivations of most of these approximations have been for the exterior region , but , as is discussed later , they all can easily be extended to the interior region .",
    "these approximations include those of page , brown , and ottewill@xcite for conformally invariant fields in schwarzschild spacetime , that of frolov and zelnikov@xcite for conformally invariant fields in a general static spacetime , that of anderson , hiscock and samuel@xcite for massless arbitrarily coupled scalar fields in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime , and the dewitt - schwinger approximation for massive fields which was derived by frolov and zelnikov@xcite for kerr spacetime , by anderson hiscock and samuel@xcite for a scalar field in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime and most recently by herman and hiscock@xcite for an arbitrary spacetime .    in this paper",
    "the various approximations mentioned above are used to investigate quantum effects in the interior of a schwarzschild black hole when the fields are in the hartle - hawking state .",
    "the resulting semiclassical backreaction equations are linearized about the classical geometry and their solutions are found .",
    "the questions of whether backreaction effects tend to isotropize the spacetime and whether they tend to `` soften '' the geometry as the singularity is approached are addressed .",
    "although the questions of whether the anisotropy is completely dissipated or whether the singularity is removed can not be answered by examining linear perturbations , the results do provide insight into these issues .    in section ii the interior geometry of a schwarzschild black hole is reviewed and in section iii the various analytical approximations are reviewed and discussed .",
    "solutions to the linearized backreaction equations which are derived using these approximations are displayed in section iv . in section v the dissipation of anisotropy is computed and in section vi the change in the curvature is computed .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section vii .",
    "the schwarzschild black hole is described by the metric : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the metric of the two - sphere .",
    "the coordinate @xmath2 runs from 0 to @xmath3 , and @xmath4 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "we are thus considering the complete schwarzschild manifold , as is appropriate with the hartle - hawking vacuum state .",
    "the black hole interior is the region in which @xmath7 . in the interior ,",
    "the vector field @xmath8 is timelike and the vector field @xmath9 is spacelike ; hence , the coordinate @xmath4 is a spatial coordinate , while @xmath2 is a time coordinate .    the nature of the interior is more easily visualized if new coordinate names are adopted to reflect the physical nature of the coordinates in the region of interest .",
    "defining new coordinates by setting @xmath10 the metric takes the form @xmath11 the metric given by eq .",
    "( [ insidemetric ] ) is clearly an anisotropic homogeneous cosmology . the vector field @xmath9 is , in the interior , one of the spacelike killing vector fields ( along with those on the two - sphere ) which guarantee spatial homogeneity .",
    "the spatial coordinate @xmath12 here runs from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , while @xmath13 runs from @xmath14 down to zero at the curvature singularity in the black hole interior .",
    "the schwarzschild manifold contains both an anisotropic expanding universe , the `` white hole '' portion of the extended geometry , and an anisotropic collapsing universe , the black hole interior . in this paper",
    "we shall base our discussion on the black hole interior portion of the geometry , but all conclusions may be restated in terms of the expanding white hole geometry due to the time reversal symmetry of both the schwarzschild geometry and the hartle - hawking state we shall use to perturb it . however the boundary conditions for the fields in the two cases are very different . in the black hole case they are `` initial '' conditions , while in the white hole case they are `` final '' conditions for the interior region .",
    "while it is conventional to write homogeneous cosmological metrics in terms of a proper time coordinate , i.e. , @xmath15 in the present case the spatial metric components can not be expressed in closed algebraic form in terms of such a coordinate . upon carrying out the integral in eq .",
    "( [ propertime ] ) , one finds that the range of the coordinate @xmath13 from @xmath14 down to @xmath16 corresponds to an interval of proper time equal to @xmath17 .",
    "the spacetime described by the metric of eq .",
    "( [ insidemetric ] ) , viewed as a cosmological model , is an anisotropic but homogeneous spacetime in which ( as @xmath13 proceeds from @xmath14 down to zero ) two spatial dimensions are collapsing while one is expanding .",
    "the interior schwarzschild cosmology is a special case of a type i kantowski - sachs model@xcite .",
    "since the schwarzschild metric is a vacuum solution , there is no naturally defined four - velocity of cosmological `` matter '' ; however , to explore the properties of the solution as an anisotropic cosmology , it is helpful to define a set of fiducial geodesic observers with four - velocities given by @xmath18 these observers travel along world lines with @xmath12 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 constant . in terms of the conserved quantities",
    "normally used to describe geodesics in the exterior schwarzschild metric , these observers have zero angular momentum and zero energy at infinity .    the proper volume of a cube defined by a set of fiducial observers at the corners , separated by coordinate distances @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 since the fiducial observers have four - velocities given by eq .",
    "( [ fourvel ] ) , the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 are constant .",
    "the volume goes to zero at both @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    near the singularity at @xmath26 , the schwarzschild metric of eq .",
    "( [ insidemetric ] ) may be put into a form which is locally asymptotic to a kasner universe .",
    "let coordinates @xmath28 and @xmath29 be defined as functions of and locally in the neighborhood of a point @xmath30 by @xmath31 while these coordinates can not be extended to cover the two - sphere they are perfectly adequate to describe the expansion and contraction of the cosmology in a local neighborhood .",
    "near the singularity , the schwarzschild metric then takes the form of a kasner universe with exponents @xmath32 , @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in a similar fashion",
    ", the metric may be approximated by a flat kasner @xmath37 solution near @xmath27 . there",
    "the cosmological proper time has the asymptotic form @xmath38 , and the asymptotic form of the metric is @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "the singular behavior of eq.([kasnerhorz ] ) is of course only apparent ; the surface @xmath41 is actually the black hole event horizon .",
    "to calculate the linearized metric perturbations to the schwarzschild geometry resulting from the presence of quantized fields , it is necessary to know the values of the stress - energy tensors of those fields . calculating",
    "the stress - energy tensor for a quantized field on a black hole background spacetime is an arduous task , which has been carried to completion only for a few cases .",
    "howard and candelas have computed the stress - energy of a conformally invariant scalar field in the schwarzschild geometry @xcite .",
    "jensen and ottewill have computed the vacuum stress - energy of a massless vector field in schwarzschild @xcite .",
    "more recently anderson , hiscock , and samuel have developed a method for computing the vacuum stress - energy for a general ( arbitrary curvature coupling and mass ) scalar field in an arbitrary static spherical spacetime and have applied their method to the reissner - nordstrm geometry@xcite .    in each of these studies ,",
    "an analytic expression for @xmath42 has been developed as a consequence of the procedure used to compute the exact values for @xmath43 .",
    "these approximate expressions are generated by using a fourth order wkb expansion for the field modes in the unrenormalized expression for @xmath43 and then subtracting off the dewitt - schwinger counterterms @xcite to renormalize the stress - tensor .",
    "the resulting analytic expressions are closely related to approximate expressions for the vacuum stress - energy derived by page , brown , and ottewill ( pbo ) @xcite and frolov and zelnikov ( fz ) @xcite .",
    "the analytic approximation found by howard and candelas is identical to the pbo approximation for the conformal scalar field s stress - energy in schwarzschild spacetime ; further , their numerical results show that the approximation is quite accurate for all values of @xmath2 down to the horizon . in the case of the vector field ,",
    "the analytic expression derived by jensen and ottewill is equal to the pbo approximation for a conformal vector field plus a traceless term proportional to @xmath44 ; the resulting expression yields a good match to the numerical results for the vector field @xcite .",
    "the analytic approximation developed by anderson , hiscock , and samuel reduces to the fz approximation when restricted to conformal coupling ; it has generally been shown to be valid for arbitrary curvature coupling when compared to numerical results in the reissner - nordstrm geometry ( which , of course , includes schwarzschild as a special case ) .",
    "each of these expressions has been derived in the exterior region of the black hole .",
    "there is good reason to believe they are valid in the interior also .",
    "the components of the curvature tensors in an orthonormal frame are analytic functions of @xmath2 near the event horizon .",
    "each of the approximations is also an analytic function of the radial coordinate @xmath2 near the event horizon .",
    "thus the analytic extension of these approximations into the interior region is trivial to obtain .",
    "further candelas and jensen@xcite have numerically computed @xmath45 in the interior of a schwarzschild black hole when the field is in the hartle - hawking state .",
    "they find that page s approximation@xcite for @xmath45 arises in a natural way from the calculation of the renormalized feynman green function in the interior region and that it is a good approximation in much of the interior region .    in this paper the anderson , hiscock",

    "thus the best that can be done when using the dewitt - schwinger approximation is to solve the semiclassical equations perturbatively , in which case the first order term is definitely the most important .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to numerically compute the stress - energy tensor to study semiclassical interior effects beyond the level of linear perturbation theory .",
    "we have addressed the question of whether anisotropy is dissipated in the interior by treating the black hole interior as an anisotropic , homogeneous cosmology and examining whether the perturbed metric has greater or lesser anisotropy than the background schwarzschild metric .",
    "we find that minimally and conformally coupled scalar fields , and the spinor field , decrease the anisotropy as one approaches the singularity , while vector fields increase the anisotropy .",
    "these results are described from the point of view of the black hole interior , which as a cosmology is a universe approaching a final singularity .",
    "if one instead interpreted our results in terms of the white hole portion of the schwarzschild penrose diagram , then scalar and spinor fields would enhance anisotropy as one moves away from the singularity , while vector fields would reduce it .",
    "however as previously mentioned , in this case the boundary conditions for the fields are `` final '' rather than `` initial '' conditions .",
    "we have also examined whether there is any evidence for the semiclassical perturbation modifying the approach to the singularity .",
    "while within the context of perturbation theory , it is impossible to determine whether quantum effects might substantially change the character of the singularity ( perhaps even eliminating it ) , one can ask whether an observer approaching the final black hole singularity will measure larger or smaller curvature in the perturbed metric than in the classical schwarzschild case .",
    "we find that massless fields of all spin , and massive vector fields , generally strengthen the singularity ( curvature grows faster than in schwarzschild ) while the massive scalar and spinor fields weaken the growth of curvature .",
