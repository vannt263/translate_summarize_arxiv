    "in the mean - field limit the phase diagram of type ii superconductors has two phases : the normal state and the mixed state in which the lines of magnetic flux are arranged in a triangular abrikosov lattice @xcite .",

    "this criterion is not rigorous and does not provide a satisfying thermodynamic melting theory .",
    "the possibility of a first order phase transition due to decoupling of the different layers has also been investigated . however",
    ", a decoupling transition is mostly expected to occur in addition to melting , and the lack of experimental evidence for two separate phase transitions has lead to a widespread belief that either there is no sharp decoupling transition or that it occurs simultaneously with flux lattice melting .",

    "although there is striking experimental evidence for a first order phase transition in both ybco and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath8 ( bscco ) , there are certain features of the experimental data that are not explained by the standard vortex lattice melting picture , most importantly the loss of first order behavior along the transition line at high ( both for ybco and bscco ) and low ( ybco only ) fields .",
    "note that an end of the first order phase transition line at a critical end - point is not possible for a vortex lattice melting line , because the phase boundary separates phases of different symmetry .",
    "our first order transition is not associated with any symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the existence of a low field critical end - point should be expected and is directly observed in the simulation .    in the framework of a vortex lattice melting picture the disappearance of the first order melting line can be explained by the presence of a tricritical point where the first order transition changes to a continuous one .",
    "such behavior is commonly assumed to occur as an effect of sample disorder , which is to a certain degree present even in the best crystals .",
    "however , there is no wide consensus on the phase diagram in the presence of disorder .",
    "the three most important categories to distinguish are the disordered liquid , vortex glass and bragg glass scenarios .",

    "such a vortex glass phase would be truly superconducting with vanishing dc resistance .",

    "later it was shown that these resistive drops coincide with a discontinuity in the magnetization , the first thermodynamic quantity found to be discontinuous at the transition line @xcite .",

    "an important relation for our discussion of the value of @xmath20 in different ybco samples ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : critpt ] ) is that an increase in oxygen content corresponds not only to an increase in natural twin density , but also to a systematic decrease in the anisotropy @xmath12 in the samples used in ref .",
    "our work suggests that this change in anisotropy rather than the presence of twins may cause the change in @xmath20 .",
    "our numerical work provides an explanation for the existence of @xmath20 as well as a qualitatively correct prediction of its rapid increase when @xmath12 is decreased , such as can be achieved by increasing the oxygen content .",
    "another noteworthy point which we shall discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : irrev ] is that the location of @xmath20 according to magnetization measurements is not always in agreement with the one measured in specific heat measurements . in a fully oxygenated sample in ref .",

    "transport measurements reflect the loss of first order character of the transition for low as well as for high fields @xcite .",
    "the resistance only drops to zero , which would be the expected resistance for a weakly pinned lattice at the very low voltages used , for a limited range of magnetic fields . for high and low fields only a fractional drop is visible , which disappears completely somewhat below 2 and above 7 tesla .",
    "below @xmath20 and above @xmath17 as well as in samples where no latent heat at all is observed , a `` step '' in the heat capacity @xmath24 remains @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been interpreted as evidence for a second order transition .",
    "the sharpness of this `` step '' , is not altogether convincing ( see e.g. fig .  3 in ref .",

    "the `` fishtail '' magnetization anomaly @xcite , which correlates with the location of @xmath17 @xcite could be interpreted as evidence for such a transition .",
    "a lack of sharpness of this feature makes it a candidate , however , for a crossover rather than a phase transition .",
    "there has also been evidence from resistive measurements for a field driven crossover line as an extension of the first order transition in ybco @xcite .      a vital ingredient of the vortex lattice melting scenario which this paper disputes is the existence of a vortex lattice .",
    "experimentally a vortex lattice is indistinguishable from a liquid or glassy phase with short - range crystalline order on length scales large compared to the vortex separation .",
    "evidence for hexagonal coordination over large distances can be seen in ybco for low fields in bitter pattern decoration experiments @xcite . at high fields",
    "this technique fails because the vortices are too close to be individually resolved .",
    "a powerful method to detect long - range vortex correlations is neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "the bragg peaks observed in these experiments show that vortex positions are long - range correlated in all directions .",
    "the correlation length along the field can be enhanced by twin boundaries if the field is oriented along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "however , data from experiments with different orientation of the applied magnetic field show similar results , and thus indicate that the long correlation lengths along the field are independent of the presence of twin planes .",
    "the intrinsic crystalline in - plane correlation length is more difficult to deduce from neutron scattering data , because twin boundaries and/or pinning to the underlying crystal determine preferred orientations and can thereby strongly enhance orientational order @xcite .",
    "although neutron scattering experiments give evidence for long - range vortex correlations , some features of the data are unexpected in the framework of a vortex lattice melting picture .",
    "the observed diffraction patterns suggest the existence of a vortex lattice or a bragg glass , which means that the melting transition is expected to be of first order .",
    "such a first order melting transition should be visible as a discontinuous appearance of bragg peak intensity , as the temperature is reduced .",
    "however , the peaks appear continuously , which leads the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the conclusion that they must be dealing with second order vortex glass melting .",
    "an additional feature of the melting line defined by the onset of bragg peaks ( which is not mentioned in ref.@xcite ) is that it lies in the @xmath6-@xmath7 phase diagram distinctly below the line corresponding to thermodynamically measured first order transition lines @xcite under the assumption of scaling with mass anisotropy like @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "this point will be investigated in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : bragg ] . for the alternative phase diagram presented in this paper ,",
    "a continuous onset of bragg peak intensity somewhat below the first order transition line is just the expected behavior .",
    "a large number of numerical monte carlo or langevin dynamics simulations of different three dimensional models have with few exceptions provided evidence of first order vortex lattice melting .",
    "the main disagreement between different simulations of layered models concerns the question whether layer decoupling coincides with this melting transition . in this section",
    "we give an overview of different numerical results and point out what we consider to be the weaknesses of the respective models used .    from the frustrated xy and villain and lattice london models there is evidence for first order melting and distinct decoupling as well as , at least in the thermodynamic limit , only one simultaneous first order melting and decoupling transition .",
    "very recent simulations of the uniformly frustrated 3d xy model show a vortex lattice melting transition as well as a second , possibly first order , phase transition within the liquid phase , at which the vortex line tension goes to zero @xcite . in these models",
    "vortices are confined to a lattice . in 3d ,",
    "a lattice acts as a close grid of columnar pins with infinite pinning potential in the thermodynamic limit which may lead to spurious phase transitions . for the lll , alteration of the phase diagram by the presence of a lattice pinning potential which breaks translational and rotational",
    "invariance has been predicted from a theoretical analysis .",
    "there are also numerical models that avoid using a lattice .",
    "numerical models relying on the 2d bose gas analogy yield simultaneous melting and loss of phase coherence along the @xmath11-axis @xcite .",
    "a different scenario has been seen in a simulation by wilkin and jensen , in which vortex pancakes in different layers are represented by particles with in - layer short - range repulsive and inter - layer attractive interactions . a first order transition associated with decoupling of vortices and without melting character is observed . at a lower temperature a melting crossover without noticeable thermodynamic",
    "signature occurs .",
    "when sufficient point disorder is added , the decoupling transition loses its first order character . while not being affected by pinning to a numerical lattice , the latter models may give unrealistic results because they allow variation of vortex position only , neglecting fluctuations of order parameter magnitude and in many cases having unrealistic short - range interactions @xcite .",
